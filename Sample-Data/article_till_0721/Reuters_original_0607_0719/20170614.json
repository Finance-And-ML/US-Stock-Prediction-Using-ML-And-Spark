Swing like crazy,  Ozuna said,  and let's see what happens.  On Tuesday night, that approach worked as Giancarlo Stanton and Ozuna homered to lead the Miami Marlins to an 8-1 win over the Oakland A's at Marlins Park. Stanton, who hit a two-run shot, leads the team with 17 homers. Ozuna, who went 3-for-3 with a solo blast, has 16 homers. They are tied for the team lead with 44 RBIs. Ozuna, who is hitting .386 with 11 homers at home this season, drew praise from Marlins manager Don Mattingly.  He's growing,  Mattingly said.  Hopefully, he keeps building on what he's doing.  Ozuna, who is hitting .332 overall this season, was asked about the All-Star Game, which is being hosted by the Marlins this year on July 11.  I have to earn it,  he said.  I have to fight for that spot.  Related CoveragePreview: Athletics at MarlinsIn addition to Ozuna and Stanton, Miami's offense got a boost from Tyler Moore, who is playing for injured first baseman Justin Bour. Moore went 3-for-4 with a pair of doubles and two RBIs. Jose Urena (5-2), who retired 14 consecutive batters from the second through the fifth innings, earned the win. He went six-plus innings, allowing three hits, one walk and one run while striking out four. Urena, 25, has won four straight games -- including a victory at Oakland on May 23 -- and his five wins are already a career high.  Little bit better mix of pitches -- he probably used his sinker more than last time with the four-seamer,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  More of a three-pitch mix than we saw last time.  When you are throwing 97 mph, you have to be ready for the fastball.  A's starter Jharel Cotton (3-7), a former Miami Dade College standout, took the loss in his first appearance against the Marlins. He allowed eight hits and five runs in five innings. Miami (28-35) snapped a two-game losing streak. The A's (27-37), who are in last place in the American League West, are 9-24 on the road this season. Urena, who balked in a run in the second inning, allowed the A's to load the bases on two singles and a hit by pitch. Yonder Alonso strolled home from third on the balk. Miami tied the score 1-1 in the fourth on Ozuna's opposite-field homer to right. The Marlins took a 5-1 lead in the fifth. Moore pulled a double that one-hopped the fence in left, advanced on a fly out and scored on a two-out, opposite-field single by Dee Gordon. Stanton then pulled his two-run homer to left, and the Marlins tacked on with an RBI double by J.T. Realmuto. Cotton, who said Ozuna and Stanton both hit sliders, was not happy with his overall performance.  It's frustrating that everything came with two outs in the fifth,  he said.  Everything just snowballed. I have to be better.  (Ozuna and Stanton) are their big guys, and they hurt me.  As for pitching in Miami for the first time as a pro, Cotton paid homage to a former Marlins star pitcher, the late Jose Fernandez.  My family was here, and just having them come out and watch me pitch was amazing,  Cotton said.  It was a good feeling to pitch in Jose Fernandez's home.  Miami closed the scoring with yet another big inning -- a three-run seventh that included a two-run double by Moore.  We have to find a way to shut down the big inning,  Melvin said.  We've been giving (them) up here recently.  NOTES: Oakland is expected to recall RHP Daniel Gossett from Triple-A Nashville so he can start Wednesday's game at Miami. It will be his major-league debut. ... Marlins RF Giancarlo Stanton (bruised right wrist) started for the first time since he was hit by a pitch on Saturday. ...

Anbang's vertiginous rise has also brought unwanted attention.  One of Anbang's units was censured by China's insurance regulator in May for designing products to skirt a regulation aimed at curtailing risk. As a result, the unit was barred from issuing new products for three months. That move came amid a widespread regulatory crackdown on what was seen as excessive use of universal life products by some insurers, and as China's leadership moves to curb risk in the financial system.  A handful of insurers, led by Anbang, have issued higher-yielding products to raise funds to acquire stakes in listed companies. Earlier this year, the country's chief insurance regulator, who had overseen a doubling of the size of the industry in three years, was removed from his post after being placed under investigation. Outside of China, Anbang's deal-making has faltered as well.

Rise to Prominence Anbang's recent difficulties come during a highly sensitive year in China, with the ruling Communist Party set to hold its five-yearly party congress later this year, and amid a broader crackdown on corruption led by President Xi Jinping.

His manager, Dusty Baker, wanted to give Zimmerman an extra day and explained that facing knuckleballer R.A. Dickey on Tuesday would be easier that having to rotate his hips at the plate against someone throwing 95 miles per hour. The strategy worked as Zimmerman had three hits, including two homers, and drove in three runs as the Washington Nationals beat the Atlanta Braves 10-5 on Tuesday to snap a four-game losing streak.  It was a smart move,  Zimmerman said before the game. It was the second night in a row the Nationals scored 10 runs against the Braves. This time they won.  He looked fine to me,  Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said.  You talk about a quality person; a true pro. He is just a wonderful person. He is one of those boring pros (who just does his job).  Zimmerman hit a two-run homer off starter R.A. Dickey during a five-run sixth inning to give the Nationals a 6-5 lead. His homer came after Bryce Harper had an RBI single to pull Washington to within 5-4. Related CoveragePreview: Braves at NationalsAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchThe second homer by Zimmerman was his 19th of the year and tied Vladamir Guerrero for first on the all-time franchise (Montreal/Washington) list with 234 career homers.  It is great,  Nationals starting pitcher Joe Ross said of having Zimmerman back.  He kind of picked up where he left off.  Later in the sixth, Matt Wieters had a two-run double to score Daniel Murphy and Anthony Rendon, who scored just steps back of Murphy as the Nationals led 8-5. Murphy had his third hit, an RBI double in the seventh, to make it 9-5 and Trea Turner drove in a run with a single in the eighth for a 10-5 lead. Rio Ruiz gave the Braves a 4-3 lead with a two-run homer to right in the sixth. It was the second career homer for Ruiz, who went deep against Max Scherzer of the Nationals on May 20 for his first MLB homer. Ross threw a season-high 102 pitches and gave up nine hits and five runs in 5 2/3 innings. The winning pitcher was Trevor Gott (1-0), who retired one batter in the sixth. Enny Romero pitched two scoreless innings for the Nationals. Dickey (4-5) allowed eight runs and eight hits (three homers) with six strikeouts in five innings plus five batters.  He went out in the six and just lost (the knuckler). It was just one of these feel things,  Snitker said of Dickey.  He just flattened out. It didn't long to figure that out either.  Ryan Raburn and Michael A. Taylor each had two hits for the Nationals. Dansby Swanson was 3-for-3 with a walk for the Braves. Brandon Phillips had three hits and Ender Inciarte and Matt Adams each had two for Atlanta. Dickey had trouble keeping his knuckleball in the park early on. The Nationals scored three runs in the first as Bryce Harper drove in a run on a groundout and Zimmerman and Murphy hit back-to-back homers. Swanson had a two-run double in the fourth to trim the lead to 3-2. The drive to right-center scored Adams, who had singled, and Ruiz, who reached on a walk with one out. Swanson entered the game hitting .333 this month after batting .156 in April and .216 in May. Washington entered Tuesday leading the National League in batting average (.274), homers (94) and was second in runs scored (343) to Colorado's 344. But the Nationals bullpen had the worst ERA in the league at 5.11 after giving up five runs in four innings in an 11-10 loss Monday to Atlanta. But Zimmerman helped alleviate any angst about the bullpen Tuesday.  He caught up to a good fastball (against Ian Krol) for his third hit,  Baker said.  It was good to have Zim back. Rayburn had a good game, too. Our offense bailed Joe out tonight. His location was off. He battled and battled.  NOTES: Braves RHP Julio Teheran (5-4, 5.08) will face Washington RHP Tanner Roark (6-3, 3.87) in the series finale Wednesday, though rain is in the forecast. ... Washington manager Dusty Baker was drafted in the 26th round by the Braves in 1967 and played eight years with Atlanta. ... Braves C Kurt Suzuki (2012-13) and LHP Ian Krol (2013) are former Nationals. Krol had retired 18 batters in a row over seven games before 1B Ryan Zimmerman singled in the seventh. ...

But they broke out the bats in a big way, getting homers No. 59 and No. 61 from Andrew McCutchen and No. 60 from John Jaso to earn a 5-2 win over the Rockies at PNC Park McCutchen hit a solo home run to left field to start the scoring in the fourth inning and then came through with another shot to the bleachers with Josh Bell on base in the eighth. The pair of round-trippers gave McCutchen 11 for the season and continued a hot stretch that started after he got two days off, made a mechanical adjustment and was moved to No. 6 in the batting order. Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at PiratesColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchSince getting back in the lineup May 26, McCutchen has gone 25-for-63 (.397). His batting average has climbed from a season low of .200 on May 23 to .255.  I had two very productive days in Atlanta,  McCutchen said, referencing his down days before the hot streak.  I had two days where I was really able to get myself where I needed to be as opposed to trying to get where I needed to be before the game and then taking it out there in the game.  Jaso came through with a two-run pinch-hit homer that also scored Jordy Mercer in the seventh inning. It was Jaso's fourth home run and second pinch-hit home run of the season. He is hitting .400 (6-for-15) as a pinch hitter this year. The reason for so much success at pinch hitting?  I don't know,  Jaso answered.  I just get ready during the game, stretch out and relax. I don't want to get too amped up or anything like that. I've done it a lot in my career. I know that nerves can get in there and adrenaline, so just keep that calm and it becomes another at-bat like you started the game.  Jaso was pinch hitting for Gerrit Cole, who earned the win (4-6). Cole snapped a four-start streak of subpar performances by throwing seven three-hit innings and allowing just one run.  I liked the domination of the bottom of the zone early,  manager Clint Hurdle said.  I liked the way he used his fastball. I liked the way he mixed in his off-speed pitches. He executed pitches. He stayed on point. He stayed on the aggressive side.  In the fifth, Colorado's Trevor Story walked and scored from first on a single to shallow left field by Tony Wolters. Story was running on the pitch and never stopped, getting to home plate right as the relay throw came from shortshop Jordy Mercer to catcher Elias Diaz. But Story snuck his hand around Diaz and touched home plate to tie the game.  (I) got a good jump,  Story said.  It helped that I was in motion. Kind of picked up the ball and saw that it was in no-man's land. We talk about that all the time. We run until (third-base coach) Stu (Cole) stops us. I could get the sense that it might have been one of those plays.  Story also drove in Mark Reynolds with an RBI single in the ninth off Pirates reliever Felipe Rivero. Tyler Chatwood went six innings, allowing just the McCutchen home run. He struck out five and allowed six hits. Adam Ottavino took the loss (0-1). NOTES: Pirates C Chris Stewart has been performing baserunning drills in Pittsburgh as he returns from a strained left hamstring. Stewart has been on the disabled list since May 30. ...

China's No.5 rural commercial bank by assets priced the deal at HK$5.10 per share, after marketing it in a HK$4.99-HK$5.27 indicative range, said a person with direct knowledge of the deal, who did not want to be identified as details of the transaction were not public. The initial public offering consisted of 1.58 billion shares, with 91 percent new shares and the remainder existing stock from a group of 13 state-owned shareholders. It was the largest IPO in Hong Kong this year, surpassing the $511 million raised by WuXi Biologics (Cayman) Inc last week. GRCB declined to comment on the IPO pricing. The shares are slated to debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange on June 20. Chinese lenders are barred from selling new shares below book value, making some IPOs less appealing to investors since several banks already listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange trade at lower valuations. Hong Kong brokerage Phillip Securities, which offers margin loans for retail investors to buy into share offerings in the city, said demand from retail investors for the GRCB deal amounted to just HK$30 million worth of stock.  That was quite a small amount, given the size of the IPO,  said Jasper Chan, assistant manager of corporate finance at Phillip Securities.  Retail investors don't really want to buy it because they can get similar stocks in the secondary market and they're cheaper than buying into IPOs.  Worries about rising bad debt in China also dragged on investor sentiment. Non-performing loans at Chinese commercial banks rose to 1.58 trillion yuan ($232.4 billion) at the end of March, from 1.51 trillion yuan in December, regulatory data showed. With the world's No.2 economy growing at a slower pace, that figure is expected to grow further, analysts said. The benchmark index for financial firms listed in Hong Kong is up 10.8 percent this year, well below the 17.1 percent gain in the broader market index. GRCB's deal comes ahead of other expected listings from medium-sized Chinese lenders in Hong Kong, including Zhongyuan Bank and Bank of Gansu, which plan to raise about $1 billion and $700 million respectively.

Crew Group Inc disclosed terms on Tuesday of a debt restructuring deal that would roughly cut in half the value of its nearly $567 million in bonds, as well as extend their maturity by two years, after receiving the backing of some key creditors. The move comes after Reuters reported last month that two investment firms, Blackstone Group LP's (BX.N) GSO Capital Partners LP and Anchorage Capital Group LLC, were snapping up J. Crew's debt to facilitate such a deal.  The U.S. fashion retailer, facing a total debt load of $2.1 billion, asked creditors to agree to an out-of-court restructuring that would extend the maturity on bonds to 2021, which would give J. Crew more time to turn around its business and boost declining sales. J. Crew has also asked for the withdrawal of a lawsuit seeking to block its move of its intellectual property to an affiliated company. The retailer plans to pay the separate company for the use of its brand, which was opposed by some of the term loan holders, spurring the lawsuit.   GSO and hedge fund Anchorage have already agreed to swap their bonds for the new ones and to end the lawsuit, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents filed Tuesday and two people familiar with the deal.  The backing of these two creditors is important, because  together they hold 28 percent of J. Crew's $1.5 billion term loan and 67 percent of the company's approximately $500 million in bonds, according to the filings and people.  J. Crew requires 95 percent of its bondholders to accept the deal, the company has said, and can also secure a waiver to any lawsuit from a group of creditors that have a majority position in its loan.  GSO and Anchorage however face opposition from another group of creditors led by Eaton Vance Management who have invested in the term loan and plan to block J. Crew's proposed restructuring, one of the people said.  That group is working on having lenders agree to a cooperation agreement to block the deal, that person said, without disclosing the size of the group's position in the debt. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. J. Crew did not immediately respond to a request for comment beyond what it has said publicly. Both GSO and Anchorage declined to comment. Eaton Vance did not immediately return a request for comment.

On Monday, Panama said it had broken with Taiwan to forge ties with Beijing, in a major victory for China's efforts to isolate the island it views as a renegade province. Following Panama's departure from the fold, Taiwan has full ties with 20 countries - several of them in Central America, where Taiwanese economic aid has helped support a region that relies heavily on agriculture and struggles with law and order. The most populous of those, Guatemala, declined to comment on its future with Taiwan.  We don't have an official position on this. It's a matter that concerns other countries,  Guatemalan Foreign Minister Carlos Morales told Reuters when asked if his country would go down the same path as Panama with China. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen went to Guatemala in January during a visit to a clutch of Central American allies. Her Guatemalan counterpart, Jimmy Morales, said at the time he expected Taipei to deepen ties with the region. Neighboring El Salvador said it had no plans to enter into new ties with other governments.  Right now, the establishment of diplomatic relations with (other countries) is not on my radar,  Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez told reporters after a fund-raising event that focused on Taiwanese investment for projects in the country. El Salvador has had formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan since 1933 and also maintains trade ties with China. Tsai began her January visit in Honduras, where a government official also said on Tuesday the Honduran administration would make no official comment on the shake-up in Panama. REFILE - CORRECTING TYPO IN SURNAME OF TAIWANESE AMBASSADOR - El Salvador's Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez and Taiwan's Ambassador to El Salvador Florencia Hsie (unseen) participate in a news conference in San Salvador, El Salvador, June 13, 2017.Jose CabezasSpeaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, the official said Honduras was maintaining its diplomatic and commercial relations with Taiwan. Since 2006, Taiwan has loaned Honduras some $205 million and donated another $27 million, including an Embraer Legacy 600 jet used as the president's official plane. Taiwan also has provided the country with a wide range of agricultural assistance. Tsai also visited Nicaragua on her trip but she did not stop at Panama. Nicaragua's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Panama's move.  Relations between Taiwan and Nicaragua are very solid,  especially since Tsai's visit, said Taiwanese-born Nicaraguan businessman Gilberto Wong, highlighting Taiwan's investment. After the visit, a high-level Nicaraguan delegation led by Foreign Minister Denis Moncada went to Taipei in April and agreed on new investment projects Taiwan would finance. Taiwan's government has said it was sorry and angry over Panama's decision, and that it would not compete with China in what it described as a  diplomatic money game . But in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi rejected any suggestion that China had bought Panama's recognition.  Panama did not express any hesitation, did not raise any preconditions, and there isn't any so-called transaction,  Wang said in a speech posted to the ministry's website late on Tuesday. Still, Robert Manning, an Asia expert and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said China was gradually extending its influence in Latin America and that pressure was likely to continue to rise on countries to switch sides.  The weight of China is being felt in many places and not just in Latin America,  Manning said.  The trend line is moving in that direction.

The move comes about a month after the Indian government gave the central bank greater power to deal with bad loans, including directing banks to initiate an insolvency resolution process in the case of a default under the bankruptcy code. The RBI said the 12 accounts constituted about 25 percent of the overall gross non-performing assets, adding it will direct lenders to begin insolvency proceedings around these accounts. The committee narrowed the list to 12 by focusing on accounts owing more than 50 billion rupees ($777.2 million), where 60 percent or more of the loan had been already classified as non-performing by banks as of March 31, 2016. Those 12 accounts were identified based on  objective, non-discretionary criterion  outlined by an internal advisory committee, the RBI said in a statement. The RBI, however, did not provide details about the loans or the banks holding them, which are typically not made public. The banks have been given six months to finalise resolution plans for other non-performing accounts that do not currently qualify under this criteria. If no resolution plan is hatched in that period then banks will have to begin insolvency proceedings on these accounts too, RBI said. Doubts Remain The move marks India's latest attempt to tackle the record 9.64 trillion rupees ($150 billion) in stressed loans as of December, which have choked new credit and hurt economic growth. Loans classified as non-performing amounted to more than 7 trillion rupees as of March, although final numbers have yet to come. Sapan Gupta, a lawyer at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, called it  a positive and bold step , though some details would need to be worked out, including if a single bank or banks would jointly start the bankruptcy proceedings. Others expected RBI action include changes to guidelines for restructuring of stressed loans.  The intent of the government and the regulator is clear that this needs to be addressed in this financial year,  Gupta said. A senior banker at a large state-run lender declined to give details about the accounts identified by the RBI, saying it comprised  all the known cases  in media reports. State-run lenders, who dominate India's banking sector, carry the bulk of the soured debt. Meanwhile, loans to sectors like infrastructure, power, iron and steel account for the biggest share of non-performing assets. But challenges remain, including a largely untested insolvency process. Meanwhile, rating agencies have warned India will need to inject significantly more capital to tackle bad debt and meet upcoming global Basel III banking rules than the 700 billion rupees planned by New Delhi.

Crew Group Inc disclosed terms on Tuesday of a debt restructuring deal that would roughly cut in half the value of its nearly $567 million in bonds, as well as extend their maturity by two years, after receiving the backing of some key creditors. The move comes after Reuters reported last month that two investment firms, Blackstone Group LP's (BX.N) GSO Capital Partners LP and Anchorage Capital Group LLC, were snapping up J. Crew's debt to facilitate such a deal.  The U.S. fashion retailer, facing a total debt load of $2.1 billion, asked creditors to agree to an out-of-court restructuring that would extend the maturity on bonds to 2021, which would give J. Crew more time to turn around its business and boost declining sales. J. Crew has also asked for the withdrawal of a lawsuit seeking to block its move of its intellectual property to an affiliated company. The retailer plans to pay the separate company for the use of its brand, which was opposed by some of the term loan holders, spurring the lawsuit.   GSO and hedge fund Anchorage have already agreed to swap their bonds for the new ones and to end the lawsuit, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents filed Tuesday and two people familiar with the deal.  The backing of these two creditors is important, because  together they hold 28 percent of J. Crew's $1.5 billion term loan and 67 percent of the company's approximately $500 million in bonds, according to the filings and people.  J. Crew requires 95 percent of its bondholders to accept the deal, the company has said, and can also secure a waiver to any lawsuit from a group of creditors that have a majority position in its loan.  GSO and Anchorage however face opposition from another group of creditors led by Eaton Vance Management who have invested in the term loan and plan to block J. Crew's proposed restructuring, one of the people said.  That group is working on having lenders agree to a cooperation agreement to block the deal, that person said, without disclosing the size of the group's position in the debt. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. J. Crew did not immediately respond to a request for comment beyond what it has said publicly. Both GSO and Anchorage declined to comment. Eaton Vance did not immediately return a request for comment.

May's total of 72.26 million tonnes was just below April's monthly record of 72.78 million tonnes. The ramp-up in steel output has been spurred by high margins due to tighter supplies of construction steel after Beijing vowed to crack down on low-quality furnaces by the end of this month.  If we break down the monthly output into daily, we can see the production is gradually slowing down as demand is weakening,  said Bai Jing, steel analyst at Galaxy Futures.  But the margin of over 1,000 yuan ($147.11) a tonne on rebar is still high enough to entice mills to produce more,  said Bai. The world's largest steel producer and consumer cut some 65 million tonnes of steel capacity in 2016 and aims to cut another 50 million tonnes of outdated capacity this year, not including low-quality steel. The most-traded rebar futures gained more than a quarter this year, peaking at 3,377 yuan a tonne in March, but dropped back to 2,930 yuan a tonne on Wednesday. In the first four months, production totaled 346.8 million tonnes, up 4.4 percent from the same period a year earlier, Wednesday's data showed.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, edged down 0.1 percent to 96.930 . Against the yen, the dollar inched 0.1 percent lower to 109.98, while the euro added 0.1 percent to $1.1217 . The Fed is scheduled to announce its monetary policy decision at 2 p.m. eastern time (1800 GMT) on Wednesday at the end of a two-day policy meeting, followed by a press conference by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. The Fed may also provide more clues on how it plans to reduce its holdings of more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Economists polled by Reuters overwhelmingly see the U.S. central bank hiking its benchmark rate to a target range of 1.00 to 1.25 percent this week, though expectations for further rate increases are fading. What emerges from the Fed meeting  is certainly going to chart the course for a lot, including the strength of the dollar,  said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the private client group of U.S. Bank in Helena, Montana, who spoke from Minneapolis.  There is some risk that we could see a more dovish outlook,  he said. Fed funds futures on Tuesday suggested traders saw about a 29 percent chance of rates rising to 1.25-1.50 percent at the Fed's Sept. 19-20 meeting, and a 57 percent chance of such a move at its Dec. 12-13 meeting .  What investors want to know most is the pace of rate hikes going forward,  said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust in Tokyo.  With many market participants worried about a dovish outlook, a surprisingly hawkish one could catch some investors off guard,  she said.  The U.S. economy isn't doing so badly, so anything is possible.  Traders and analysts appear divided over whether China's central bank will once again follow the Fed and raise its short-term rates, as it did in March. Depreciation pressure on the yuan has abated, for now, after authorities engineered sharp gains in May and changed the calculation for the daily midpoint to flush out short sellers. The Bank of Japan, which is also meeting this week, is expected to keep its monetary policy unchanged. The New Zealand dollar slipped 0.1 percent to $0.7215 after touching a low of $0.7197, moving away from the previous session's nearly four-month high of $0.7228. New Zealand's current account deficit as a proportion of gross domestic product widened in the March quarter to its most in a year, data out on Wednesday showed. The dollar resumed its drop against its Canadian counterpart after skidding to its lowest levels since late February in the wake of hawkish comments from Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz, who signalled that the BOC could raise interest rates sooner than previously thought. The U.S. dollar slipped 0.1 percent to C$1.3221 after falling as far as C$1.3209 overnight, its lowest since Feb. 28.

Kalanick's move comes after a months-long investigation led former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who was hired by Uber to look into its culture and workplace practices after a female former employee publicly accused the company of what she described as brazen sexual harassment. Uber on Tuesday released the recommendations from that report, which include reducing Kalanick's sweeping authority and instituting more controls over spending, human resources and the behavior of managers. (bit.ly/2rX2xA5) Kalanick's departure, even if it is temporary, is a thunderclap for the Silicon Valley startup world, where company founders in recent years have enjoyed great autonomy and often become synonymous with their firms.  It also marks a pivotal moment for the world's most valuable venture-backed private company, which has been largely defined by Kalanick's brash approach. Kalanick, 40, said he needed the time away to grieve for his recently deceased mother and to work on his leadership skills, according to a staff email seen by Reuters. He did not say how long he would be away.   If we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve,  Kalanick wrote in his email.  During this interim period, the leadership team, my directs, will be running the company.  According to a source familiar with the matter, Kalanick can return to the company whenever he would like. More Oversight Needed The company on Tuesday shared with its staff 47 recommendations for management and policy changes that were unanimously adopted by the board on Sunday. Kalanick was not at the meeting, said a source who was present.  The meeting was marred by private equity executive David Bonderman making a sexist remark about women talking too much. He later resigned from the board of directors, calling his comment  careless, inappropriate, and inexcusable.  The recommendations from Holder's firm, Covington and Burling, include adding an independent director to the board and considering an independent chair; mandated manager training; and a bigger and more independent audit committee to oversee spending and management.  I would now suggest to any startup, here are the Covington rules, and when you get passed 100 people, put these in place,  said Steve Blank, a startup founder and mentor and adjunct professor at Stanford University.   FILE PHOTO - Uber CEO Travis Kalanick attends the summer World Economic Forum in Tianjin, China on June 26, 2016.Shu Zhang/File PhotoOther recommendations prohibit romances between bosses and their subordinates and create clearer guidelines on the use of drugs and alcohol.  I think it paints a picture of a company pretty out of control with no oversight from the board or basic controls,  said Elizabeth Ames, senior vice president at the Anita Borg Institute, which advocates for women in technology. At Tuesday's employee meeting, human resources chief Liane Hornsey thanked the former employee who wrote about harassment, Susan Fowler, for being a catalyst for the changes. She received applause from employees, according to the source at the meeting. Holder's recommendations stressed the importance of a new chief operating officer. The company has been searching for a No.2 executive for more than three months and is also looking for a chief financial officer.  Slideshow (2 Images)A number of senior Uber managers left in recent weeks as the Holder investigation and a parallel probe focused strictly on sexual harassment and other employee complaints, conducted by the law firm Perkins Coie, moved forward. The most recent departing executives included Emil Michael, head of business and Kalanick's closest confidant, and Eric Alexander, who ran the Asia Pacific region. Uber said last week it had hired two women to fill top roles: Harvard Business School management professor Frances Frei will serve as an executive coach and Apple Inc marketing executive Bozoma Saint John was hired to mend Uber's brand. Uber also added a second woman to its board, Wan Ling Martello, an executive vice president at Nestle, to serve as an independent director.  There are 14 people at Uber who report directly to Kalanick and who will likely take on more responsibility in his absence. They include Ryan Graves, head of operations and one-time chief executive at Uber. Founder Power Uber grew to a valuation of $68 billion in seven years amid non-stop controversy. It has upended the tightly regulated taxi industry in many countries and changed the transportation landscape, but has run into legal trouble with a rough-and-tumble approach to local regulations and the way it handles employees and drivers. Uber has suffered a series of damaging setbacks in recent months, including a federal probe into the company's use of technology to evade regulators in certain cities and a trade secrets lawsuit filed by Alphabet Inc's self-driving unit, Waymo.  Some venture capitalists say Uber's challenges should serve as a warning that the Silicon Valley ethos of leaving founders in control of companies, even after they grow into big corporations, can be a dangerous proposition.  Inevitably, this will help drive the pendulum back toward better governance inside an organization,  said Robert Siegel, a lecturer at Stanford University and venture capitalist at XSeed Capital.  Sometimes we conflate great business leaders with strong personalities with great governance.

Global concerns about China have resurfaced since Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit ratings last month, saying it expects the country's financial strength will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise.         But most analysts predict only a gradual loss of momentum in coming months, especially as the government is keen to maintain economic and financial market stability ahead of a major political leadership reshuffle in autumn. May data released on Wednesday appeared to reinforce that consensus view, with still solid factory output and retail sales, and only a slight slowdown in fixed asset investment. However, property investment and construction showed a much sharper deceleration after a slew of government cooling measures in recent months. Factory output rose 6.5 percent in May from a year earlier, statistics bureau data showed on Wednesday.    Related CoverageChina May property investment eases, construction starts dip sharplyAnalysts polled by Reuters had predicted factory output would grow 6.3 percent in May, easing slightly from 6.5 percent in April. But, for now, manufacturing activity still appeared to be well supported by a year-long construction boom fueled by a government infrastructure spree and a heated property market. Sales of excavating machines doubled in May from a year earlier, according to an industry website. Fixed-asset investment growth slowed to 8.6 percent in the first five months of the year. It had been expected to slip to 8.8 percent from 8.9 percent in Jan-April. Growth of private investment slowed slightly to 6.8 percent in January-May period from 6.9 percent in the first four months, the National Bureau of Statistics said, suggesting a slight weakening of the private sector's appetite to invest as small- and medium-sized private firms still face challenges in accessing financing. Private investment accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China. Retail sales were more upbeat, rising 10.7 percent in May from a year earlier, unchanged from April and above analysts' expectations for a 10.6 percent rise due to slowing auto sales. China's vehicle sales in May posted their first back-to-back drop since 2015 after the government rolled back a tax incentive that had boosted car sales and output last year. Outlook for 2018 More Worrisome? Despite expectations the economy will lose some steam later this year, most economists believe Beijing should still easily meet its full-year growth target of 6.5 percent, coasting along after an unexpectedly strong first quarter. But some China watchers are more worried about the risks of sharp slowdown next year. A fund manager survey released by BofA Merrill Lynch this week found Chinese credit tightening ranked as the top tail risk for global investors in June for the second straight month, with nearly two-thirds of respondents saying tighter monetary policy will slow activity in the country but have little impact on global growth. Early warning indicators of a financial crisis are already flashing red, economists at Nomura said in a note this week, echoing the warnings of others such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).  Enjoy the party but stay close to the door,  said Nomura, predicting growth will slow sharply to 6.2 percent in 2018 and adding there could be a greater risk of financial turmoil.

The notes are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the proceeds will be used primarily to support the Hong Kong Branch's general funding needs. The final ratings are in line with the expected rating assigned on 5 June 2017 and follow the receipt of documents conforming to information previously received. The Hong Kong Branch's MTN programme was first rated 'BBB' by Fitch on 14 September 2016. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Hong Kong Branch is part of the legal entity, China Everbright Bank (CEB, BBB/Stable). Therefore, the notes issued under the MTN programme ultimately represent CEB's direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and are rated in line with its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR). CEB's IDR was affirmed on 4 August 2016 and is underpinned by the agency's expectations of a high probability of support from the Chinese government (A+/Stable) in the event of stress. China Everbright Bank, Hong Kong Branch was established in 2013 and is a fully licensed bank in Hong Kong. It is CEB's first and largest overseas branch and its operations and business are highly integrated with CEB. CEB also provides credit facilities to the Hong Kong Branch to support its liquidity needs. RATING SENSITIVITIES Any change to the ratings of the programme and the notes will be correlated directly with changes in CEB's IDR, which will in turn reflect any shift in the perceived willingness or ability of the Chinese government to support CEB in a full and timely manner.

Bonderman's ill-timed remark came during an all-staff meeting Tuesday to discuss of how the ride-services company plans to transform itself following a probe into sexual harassment at the company. Bonderman said in a statement sent to Reuters that he did not want his comments to create distraction for Uber, which is working to rid its culture of sexual harassment and discrimination. His resignation from the board is effective Wednesday morning.

There's a lot of data that shows when there's one woman on the board, it's much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board,  Huffington said. In response, Bonderman said:  Actually, what it shows is that it's much more likely to be more talking.

An Uber spokesman verified the authenticity and accuracy of the recording.   Bonderman, who is a founder of private equity firm TPG Capital, an Uber investor, shortly after wrote an email to Uber staff to apologize.  In his resignation statement that followed on Tuesday evening, Bonderman reiterated his regret, calling his remarks  careless, inappropriate, and inexcusable  and  the opposite of what I intended.   I take full responsibility for that,  he said.  I need to hold myself to the same standards that we're asking Uber to adopt.  Bonderman and other board members had joined Tuesday's staff meeting to lay out recommendations from an investigation into sexual harassment, diversity, inclusion and other employee concerns led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.  Holder's law firm was retained by Uber in February after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler wrote a public account of her time at the company, which she said was marred by sexual harassment and an ineffective response by management. The recommendations, which were unanimously adopted by the board on Sunday, call for reducing Chief Executive Travis Kalanick's sweeping authority at the firm and instituting more controls over spending, human resources and the behavior of managers.

(Reuters) - The jury deciding Bill Cosby's fate at his sexual assault trial adjourned on Tuesday after 16 hours of deliberations over 1-1/2 days failed to produce a verdict. The jurors in Norristown, Pennsylvania, reviewed the entertainer's account as well as that of his accuser during a long day on Tuesday. Several members of the jury of seven men and five women looked exhausted as they filed into court around 9:20 p.m. to be dismissed for the night. Earlier in the day, the jury had asked to rehear the testimony of a police officer who was present in 2005 when Andrea Constand first reported the 2004 incident and reviewed portions of sworn depositions that Cosby gave more than a decade ago. Cosby, 79, best known for his role as the dad in the 1980s hit TV family comedy  The Cosby Show,  is accused of drugging and sexually assaulting Constand at his home in the Philadelphia suburbs. Constand is one of dozens of women who have accused Cosby of sex abuse, often after plying them with drugs, in a series of incidents dating to the 1960s. The allegation by Constand, a former athletic administrator at Cosby's alma mater, Temple University, is the only one not too old to be the subject of criminal prosecution. Cosby has denied all the accusations. In addition to revisiting testimony, the jury also asked Judge Steven O'Neill to clarify how to determine whether Cosby gave Constand an intoxicant  without her knowledge,  an element of one of the charges he faces. O'Neill said he could not provide any interpretation beyond his initial instructions on the charges. Both Constand, now 44, and Cosby agree the performer gave her pills on the night in question. Constand, however, testified that she took them only after Cosby intimated they were herbal and that the drugs left her unable to resist his assault. Actor and comedian Bill Cosby (L) leaves Montgomery County Courthouse after a second day of deliberations in his sexual assault trial in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 13, 2017.Brendan McdermidIn his depositions, Cosby said the pills were Benadryl, a common allergy drug whose side effects can include drowsiness, and maintained the subsequent sexual encounter was consensual. Cosby, who based his long career on a family-friendly comedy style, did not testify. In his closing argument on Monday, Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said Cosby's words incriminated him, noting that the defendant apologized to Constand and her mother and offered to pay for Constand's schooling after her mother confronted him. Defense attorney Brian McMonagle told jurors on Monday that Cosby was guilty of adultery but not sexual assault. Slideshow (19 Images)The defense focused on inconsistencies in Constand's statements about certain details of the alleged assault and pointed out that she remained in contact with Cosby for months afterward. Cosby's attorneys sought to portray her as a woman whose allegations were motivated by money. She settled her lawsuit against Cosby in 2006 for an undisclosed sum, though jurors did not hear about that case. Also on Tuesday, Cosby's spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, released a statement from a woman, Marguerite Jackson, who was barred from testifying as a defense witness. Jackson said she worked with Constand at Temple University and shared a hotel room with her during occasional trips. On an unspecified date, she said, the women saw a news story about a famous man accused of drugging and sexually assaulting women. Constand told Jackson a high-profile man had done something similar to her, according to the statement. After Jackson pressed her, Constand admitted it had not happened but said she could easily use the story to make money off the man, Jackson said. Cosby's spokesman, Wyatt, said Jackson's statement would  let the world know  that Constand had perjured herself. Constand testified at trial that she did not know who Marguerite Jackson was. The judge ruled Jackson's testimony was inadmissible hearsay. Editing by Scott Malone and Bill Trott","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-cosby-idUSKBN19415T"},

Traditional media have become more cautious in covering Venezuela's political crisis, and half the population have limited or no access to the internet.  So in early May, Claudia Lizardo, a 29-year-old creative director, decided to spread the word about what was happening in her country in a very direct manner.  Realizing that other passengers on the buses she travels on were ill-informed about subjects she considers important, Lizardo and four friends began boarding the vehicles and reading news bulletins, their faces framed by a mockup of a TV screen. Despite participating in protests against President Nicolas Maduro's government, Lizardo's team says the goal of the project dubbed  BusTV  is to produce fact-based newscasts to reach people tired of the high-pitched biases in other media.  We want this to survive, that's why we have a respectful approach that doesn't look for confrontation with anybody,  said Laura Castillo, one of the team  broadcasting  twice a week on buses. Members of the team must not wear political slogans on their clothes, respond to comments from their audience, or attribute blame to either side for the violence that has so far killed 68 people in the protests since April.  Focusing on routes that wind through the poorest neighborhoods in Caracas, Lizardo's crew talk about the protests and shortages but also report Maduro's views, along with sports successes and recipes for meals that can be made with cheap, available ingredients.  Members of an artistic group walk past a main street as they prepare to perform a  TV news show  on a public transportation bus in Caracas, Venezuela, June 10, 2017. Picture taken June 10, 2017.

According to a study by media freedom group Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, between 2005 and 2015 more than 100 media organizations were taken off the air or censured in Venezuela.  The government says all the sanctions against the media have been because of violations to media regulation rules such as those prohibiting the incorrect use of violent images.  And private media have a history of hostility towards the ruling  Chavista  movement, including open support for a short-lived 2002 coup against Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez.  Clearly, the government has the upper hand in communication, it has the power, money and capacity to inform,  added Castillo, 41.  (BusTV) is a microscopic activity, but everything big starts tiny.

Sessions, a senior member of Trump's Cabinet and an adviser to his election campaign last year, had a series of tense exchanges with Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee during about 2-1/2 hours of testimony as they pressed him to recount discussions with the Republican president.  You raised your right hand here today and said you would solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,  Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich said.  Now you're not answering questions. You're impeding this investigation.   Sessions refused to say whether he and Trump discussed FBI Director James Comey's handling of an investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia during the election campaign before the president fired Comey on May 9. He also declined to say if Trump opposed Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe in March, and whether Justice Department officials discussed possible presidential pardons of individuals being looked at in the probe. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden told Sessions:  I believe the American people have had it with stonewalling. Americans don't want to hear that answers to relevant questions are privileged.   I am not stonewalling,  Sessions replied, saying he was simply following Justice Department policy not to discuss confidential communications with the president. Sessions' testimony did not provide any damaging new information on Trump campaign ties with Russia or on Comey's dismissal, but his refusal to discuss conversations with Trump raised fresh questions about whether the White House has something to hide. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee, which is conducting a parallel Russia probe, said on Twitter that Congress  must compel responses using whatever process necessary.  Related CoverageTrump has 'no intention' of firing special counsel Mueller: White HouseComey's friend says he's turning over Comey's Trump memos to FBI: MSNBCLast week, Comey told the Senate committee that Trump had fired him to undermine the FBI's investigation of the Russia matter.  Trump's decision to fire Comey, a move recommended by Sessions despite having already recused himself from the Russia probe, prompted critics to charge that the president was trying to interfere with a criminal investigation. Senator Angus King, an independent, questioned Sessions' legal basis for refusing to answer questions after Sessions said Trump had not invoked executive privilege regarding the conversations.  Executive privilege can be claimed by a president or senior government officials to withhold information from Congress or the courts to protect the executive branch decision-making process. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 13, 2017.Jonathan ErnstSessions said it would be  inappropriate  for him to reveal private conversations with Trump when the president  has not had a full opportunity to review the questions and to make a decision on whether or not to approve such an answer.  Legal experts said there was some merit to Sessions' argument. Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School and associate counsel under former President Barack Obama, said it was not unusual for government employees to refuse to discuss conversations with the president in order to preserve the right to invoke executive privilege later. 'Appalling' Sessions' clash with the Democratic senators was the latest chapter in a saga that has dogged Trump in his first five months as president and distracted from his domestic policy agenda including major healthcare and tax cut initiatives. Slideshow (15 Images) The suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie,  Sessions said.  I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected with the Trump campaign.  U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a report released in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to interfere in the election to help Trump in part by hacking and releasing damaging emails about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Russia has denied any such interference, and Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign with Moscow. Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation in March after revelations that he had failed to disclose two meetings last year with Russia's ambassador to Washington, Sergei Kislyak. In his testimony on Tuesday, Sessions addressed media reports that he may have had a third previously undisclosed meeting with Kislyak at Washington's Mayflower Hotel last year. Sessions said he did not have any private meetings and could not recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the hotel but did not rule out that a  brief interaction  with Kislyak may have occurred there. A former Republican senator, Sessions was an early supporter of Trump's presidential campaign, but sources say there has been tension between the two men in recent weeks because Trump was annoyed that Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe. Sessions said on Tuesday he did not recuse himself because he felt he was a subject of the investigation himself but rather because he felt he was required to by Justice Department rules.

Kalanick's move comes after a months-long investigation led former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who was hired by Uber to look into its culture and workplace practices after a female former employee publicly accused the company of what she described as brazen sexual harassment. Uber on Tuesday released the recommendations from that report, which include reducing Kalanick's sweeping authority and instituting more controls over spending, human resources and the behavior of managers. (bit.ly/2rX2xA5) Kalanick's departure, even if it is temporary, is a thunderclap for the Silicon Valley startup world, where company founders in recent years have enjoyed great autonomy and often become synonymous with their firms.  It also marks a pivotal moment for the world's most valuable venture-backed private company, which has been largely defined by Kalanick's brash approach. Kalanick, 40, said he needed the time away to grieve for his recently deceased mother and to work on his leadership skills, according to a staff email seen by Reuters. He did not say how long he would be away.   If we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve,  Kalanick wrote in his email.  During this interim period, the leadership team, my directs, will be running the company.  According to a source familiar with the matter, Kalanick can return to the company whenever he would like. More Oversight Needed The company on Tuesday shared with its staff 47 recommendations for management and policy changes that were unanimously adopted by the board on Sunday. Kalanick was not at the meeting, said a source who was present.  The meeting was marred by private equity executive David Bonderman making a sexist remark about women talking too much. He later resigned from the board of directors, calling his comment  careless, inappropriate, and inexcusable.  The recommendations from Holder's firm, Covington and Burling, include adding an independent director to the board and considering an independent chair; mandated manager training; and a bigger and more independent audit committee to oversee spending and management.  I would now suggest to any startup, here are the Covington rules, and when you get passed 100 people, put these in place,  said Steve Blank, a startup founder and mentor and adjunct professor at Stanford University.   FILE PHOTO - Uber CEO Travis Kalanick attends the summer World Economic Forum in Tianjin, China on June 26, 2016.Shu Zhang/File PhotoOther recommendations prohibit romances between bosses and their subordinates and create clearer guidelines on the use of drugs and alcohol.  I think it paints a picture of a company pretty out of control with no oversight from the board or basic controls,  said Elizabeth Ames, senior vice president at the Anita Borg Institute, which advocates for women in technology. At Tuesday's employee meeting, human resources chief Liane Hornsey thanked the former employee who wrote about harassment, Susan Fowler, for being a catalyst for the changes. She received applause from employees, according to the source at the meeting. Holder's recommendations stressed the importance of a new chief operating officer. The company has been searching for a No.2 executive for more than three months and is also looking for a chief financial officer.  Slideshow (2 Images)A number of senior Uber managers left in recent weeks as the Holder investigation and a parallel probe focused strictly on sexual harassment and other employee complaints, conducted by the law firm Perkins Coie, moved forward. The most recent departing executives included Emil Michael, head of business and Kalanick's closest confidant, and Eric Alexander, who ran the Asia Pacific region. Uber said last week it had hired two women to fill top roles: Harvard Business School management professor Frances Frei will serve as an executive coach and Apple Inc marketing executive Bozoma Saint John was hired to mend Uber's brand. Uber also added a second woman to its board, Wan Ling Martello, an executive vice president at Nestle, to serve as an independent director.  There are 14 people at Uber who report directly to Kalanick and who will likely take on more responsibility in his absence. They include Ryan Graves, head of operations and one-time chief executive at Uber. Founder Power Uber grew to a valuation of $68 billion in seven years amid non-stop controversy. It has upended the tightly regulated taxi industry in many countries and changed the transportation landscape, but has run into legal trouble with a rough-and-tumble approach to local regulations and the way it handles employees and drivers. Uber has suffered a series of damaging setbacks in recent months, including a federal probe into the company's use of technology to evade regulators in certain cities and a trade secrets lawsuit filed by Alphabet Inc's self-driving unit, Waymo.  Some venture capitalists say Uber's challenges should serve as a warning that the Silicon Valley ethos of leaving founders in control of companies, even after they grow into big corporations, can be a dangerous proposition.  Inevitably, this will help drive the pendulum back toward better governance inside an organization,  said Robert Siegel, a lecturer at Stanford University and venture capitalist at XSeed Capital.  Sometimes we conflate great business leaders with strong personalities with great governance.

As for reports that the relevant Chinese nationals were suspected of illegal missionary work in Pakistan, we will cooperate with the Pakistan government and launch and investigation in accordance with the law,  Lu said. The pair, identified by Pakistan authorities as Lee Zing Yang, 24, and Meng Li Si, 26, were abducted by armed men pretending to be policemen on May 24 in Quetta, the provincial capital of Baluchistan province. Last week, Islamic State's Amaq news agency said its members had killed them. The kidnapping was a rare crime against Chinese nationals in Pakistan, which has long had close ties to Beijing, but it has alarmed the growing Chinese community in the country. Pakistan's Interior Ministry on Monday alleged for the first time that the two were preachers who had abused the visa system by posing as business people to enter the country.  Instead of engaging in any business activity they went to Quetta and under the garb of learning Urdu language from a Korean national...were actually engaged in preaching,  the ministry said in a statement.  It did not say what kind of preachers they were, nor did it say if the Korean was from North Korea or South Korea. In his statement, Lu reiterated that China opposed all forms of terrorism and commended the Pakistan government's pledge to continue protecting Chinese people and businesses in the country.

Chinese power giant State Grid committed to building the $1.7 billion project in half the time of its European counterparts – and clinched the deal. This is a familiar tale in Pakistan and many other countries. As China makes its  Belt and Road  initiative – a massive project to connect Asia with Africa and Europe through land and maritime routes – a policy priority for the next decade, Chinese companies are taking the lion's share of infrastructure projects across the region. Just last year, Chinese firms won project contracts in Belt and Road countries worth $126 billion, state media reported.  In Pakistan, whose geographical position makes it central to Beijing's  Silk Road  plans, contracts have been awarded for projects worth more than $28 billion – all by Chinese companies working together with local firms. More than $20 billion in new investment is likely in the next few years, Pakistan's Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told Reuters this week.   Last month, Pakistan's government took out full-page newspaper advertisements on the first China-Pakistan project completed under the plan, a 1,300 mw coal plant that it said was constructed in 22 months, a record time for such a facility. The plant is owned by China's state-owned Huaneng Shandong and the Shandong Ruyi Science & Technology Group. China Inc's main advantage, officials in both countries said, is the ability of Chinese banks – with the blessing of the government - to fast-track loans for projects related to the Silk Road. That makes a huge difference to projects like Pakistan's power transmission line, which aims to end regular energy cuts that leave the country's 190 million population without electricity for several hours every day.  (Chinese companies have) that advantage because of the support of the Chinese government,  said Mohammad Younus Dagha, a senior government official who was in charge at the Water and Power Ministry until earlier this year. Dagha, who spoke to Reuters shortly before being transferred to the Commerce Ministry, said Beijing was fast-tracking loan approvals and pushing its banks and insurance firms to speed up due diligence work. Chinese government officials declined comment on specific loan approvals. Favor Lending But two officials at two Chinese state-owned banks that direct government funding, China Development Bank (CDB) and Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM), told Reuters that they have been instructed by the government to favor lending to Chinese firms for Silk Road projects. The officials also said that the two banks prefer that  companies working on infrastructure projects across the region import raw materials or purchase equipment from China.  There is some criticism in Pakistan that the awarding of the contracts to Chinese companies – while speeding up projects – is also costing the country more money. In the transmission line project deal, for example, General Electric estimated it could make one key part of the line – the converter stations – for about 25 percent less than what State Grid was charging, according to a Pakistani government official and two power sources familiar with GE's projections. By awarding the contract to State Grid, Islamabad paid a higher price, they said. An official at Nepra, Pakistan's independent energy regulator, said State Grid was also given a tax break not on offer to other investors.  Pakistani government officials declined to comment on tax issues regarding the deal.  China Electric Power Technologies Company Limited (CET), the State Grid subsidiary that will build the line, said the price it asked for was fair.      It's a very reasonable cost,  said Fiaz Ahmad Chaudhry, managing director of Pakistan's National Transmission & Despatch Company (NTDC) referring to the overall State Grid contract. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the process for Belt and Road projects in Pakistan was  open and transparent  and would bolster bilateral relations and regional prosperity. The edge of Chinese companies in Pakistan is likely to continue. Under the Silk Road plan, China and Pakistan are planning to build $57 billion worth of power plants, port facilities, railway lines and roads in Pakistan.  During a meeting in Bejing last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that the plan would be accelerated. Power Lines Power transmission towers are seen on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan April 10, 2017.Caren FirouzThe transmission line project was conceived as a government-to-government contract to build a 878-km (545-mile) connection between soon-to-built power plants near the coastal town of Matiari and Pakistan's industrial heartland by the eastern city of Lahore. According to Pakistani officials, no formal competitive bidding was sought for the project, which was finally awarded in December last year. But the officials said GE, Siemens and ABB were contacted when initial talks with State Grid stalled around mid-2016 over costs. Dagha told Reuters he briefly met officials from the three companies on the sidelines of a Paris power conference in August and informally talked about the transmission line contract with them.     GE made an initial cost estimate of $800 million for the converter stations, against State Grid's initial bid of $1.26 billion, according to documents from Nepra and sources familiar with GE's cost estimate. Despite the lower cost, the problem for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government was speed. Sharif has staked his political credibility on ending Pakistan’s frequent power blackouts before the next general election are held by August 2018.     So, Dagha said he asked the Western companies to also match State Grid's ambitious timeline and wrap up work in 27 months.     A bird flies past a power transmission tower on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan April 10,  2017.Caren Firouz They said 'you must be joking...it's impossible',  Dagha recalled. Dagha said Western executives predicted it would take at least 48 months to build the line.  They said just to prepare the proposal...and for the banks to agree to that would require at least 8-9 months at the fastest pace.      One Western energy company executive in Europe confirmed the meeting took place. Another executive in Europe who is familiar with the matter said  international companies did not have the opportunity to make a bid for the project . Both sources declined to be named.     General Electric, Siemens and ABB declined to comment. A Question of Time There was domestic pressure in Pakistan to speed up the deal, several government and regulatory officials said.     An official at Nepra, which had to sign off on the contract, said the government put pressure on the regulator to accept State Grid's price demands, warning the deal could come apart as the Chinese were prepared to walk away.  Pakistan's government did not respond to claims Nepra was  put under pressure, although government officials have in the past voiced frustrations that the regulatory agency was slowing down projects.  The Nepra official also said the Pakistani government had sweetened the deal for State Grid by removing a 7.5 percent withholding tax on tariffs the Chinese company would charge consumers the next 25 years. The tax break, the Nepra official said, was not on offer for other companies. Federal government officials and the NTDC did not respond to requests for comment on the removal of the withholding tax. State Grid was awarded the contract in December last year. It charged $1.7 billion, including a trimmed $1 billion for the converter stations, according to public documents seen by Reuters. Khawaja Asif, Pakistan's energy minister, defended charges that Pakistan was favoring the Chinese or overpaying for power infrastructure.  That conclusion is a bit misplaced, or exaggerated,  said Asif. Ashfaq Mahmood, a former top bureaucrat in Pakistan's Water and Power Ministry, said the reality of Pakistan's need to improve its infrastructure made a certain reliance on its bigger neighbor inevitable.  This is an opportunity on which the Chinese have capitalized and we cannot blame them.

But the rollback will be welcomed by global banks as it will allow them to cut back on how much expensive capital they must hold to support their business, the sources said. Since the financial crisis watchdogs around the world have been working via the G20 group of leading economies to increase cooperation between regulators following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. But the U.S. Treasury unveiled plans on Monday to upend the country's financial regulatory framework in a 150-page report that suggested more than 100 changes. (bit.ly/2sVxOlt)  Trump’s proposals are going in the wrong direction,  Jakob von Weizsaecker,  a German Social Democrat in the European Parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee, told Reuters.  In Europe, we must be careful not to forget the lessons of the financial crisis. It would be a huge mistake for us to follow the U.S. lead on this.”  The U.S. Treasury has called for a delay implementing a globally agreed rule on bank liquidity which requires banks to cover long term funding needs from January 2018.  The U.S. Treasury also wants to delay a fundamental review of banks' trading books, which was also agreed globally through the Basel Committee of international regulators. This trading book review represented a major overhaul of how banks set aside capital to cover risks from stocks, bonds and other instruments kept in their trading businesses. The U.S. Treasury said these two rules would have added new capital and liquidity requirements to existing rules banks have to follow.  The European Union has already proposed a draft law to implement these pieces of regulation. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU's financial services chief, said the Treasury's lengthy proposals would be studied in detail.  It must be noted that we need to follow what the developments will actually be, whether those recommendations will really be taken on board,  Dombrovskis told reporters. An EU source said the recommendations were  a bit worrying   and raised question marks about regulation. The Basel Committee could not be reached immediately for comment. Level Playing Fields Asia-based regulatory experts said the U.S. Treasury's position would lead some watchdogs in their region to review their implementation timelines. They are already unhappy about having the West's post-crisis reform agenda imposed on them.  This is going to create level-playing field problems, and concerns for global banks when dealing with fragmented regulatory regimes in the region,  Kevin Nixon, global & APAC lead, center for regulatory strategy at Deloitte in Sydney, said. Even so, any rollback on the fundamental review of banks' trading books by Asian regulators would generally be a boon for global banks operating in the region, Keith Pogson, senior partner, Asia Pacific financial services at EY in Hong Kong, said. The U.S. Treasury will also review a mechanism for winding down failed banks.   Depending on how the review is implemented, it can create quite a lot of trouble for cooperation between supervisors,  the EU source said.  We are looking at this with quite a bit of potential concern. It could jeopardize the whole international cooperation on resolution of banks.  Volker Rule Many of the other reforms proposed by the U.S. Treasury are domestic, such as scaling back on  gold plating  of globally agreed rules. The U.S. Treasury review also suggested the country's so-called  Volcker Rule  needed amending to avoid damaging market liquidity.

However, there are increasing signs that this may not be the case any more, at least not in every country in Asia, as renewable energy sources rapidly become cheaper and achieve the utility scale needed to ensure reliable generation. The old and new paradigms were the focus at a high-level, invitation-only forum in Singapore last week, organized by the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC). The representatives of the coal industry, as well as some respected industry analysts, presented a fairly bullish outlook for the period up to 2030, pointing to a strong pipeline of projects in both traditional coal buyers such as Japan, China and India, as well as new entrants such as Vietnam and the Philippines. On the other side, energy and climate academics and representatives of think tanks pointed to the increasing cost-competitiveness of renewable power, mounting political and community pressure for cleaner energy and the potential disruptive influence of newer technologies such as battery storage. Overall, the message from the coal industry was that they are still the cheapest, will be for some time and are therefore not going anywhere. The word from the academics and energy policy specialists was that the coal industry is too comfortable and is largely unaware that it is actually now in an existential fight, and the forces arrayed against it are motivated and increasingly effective. President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris agreement on limiting carbon pollution hasn't been replicated across Asia, with top emitters China and India pledging to meet their commitments under the deal. It's also becoming clearer that the forces pushing for increased use of renewables are moving to target countries planning to boost the use of coal. The tactics are varied and include lobbying governments and industry, trying to restrict financing for coal-fired plants, public awareness campaigns and grassroots activism. Up to now the efforts of the environmental lobby have largely been focused on developed countries, but they are now switching targets to include nations like Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia, all of which are planning new coal generation. Rapid advances in technology, such as battery storage, can also disrupt coal's advance in Asia, and this is likely to be a factor when banks, utilities and governments are deciding whether to spend billions of dollars on a new coal-fired plant that has a lifespan of at least 25 years. Coal Storm Clouds Gather The evidence seems to be that while coal use in Asia is likely to rise in coming years as plants already under construction are commissioned, the longer-term outlook is becoming far less clear. The amount of coal-fired generation capacity that started construction around the world in 2016 was 63.06 gigawatts (GW), 62 percent lower that in 2015, according to a March paper by environmental groups Coalswarm, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace. The paper also identified a 164 percent jump in the amount of coal-fired capacity put on hold in 2016 from the prior year, although the actual amount of coal capacity operating globally actually rose 3 percent to 1,964 GW. Breaking the data down by countries in Asia showed that China has 145.5 GW under construction, but 441.7 GW on hold, while India has 48.2 GW being built and 82.5 GW on hold. Among emerging coal importers, Vietnam had 15.2 GW under construction and 2.8 GW on hold, Malaysia had 3.6 GW being built and the Philippines had 4.5 GW under construction and 0.9 GW on hold. The coal industry would point to the fact that as of January this year some 272.9 GW of coal power is being built, while the environmental lobby may fire back that 607.4 GW is on hold. One of the coal miners present at the KAPSARC forum said that his company was fielding numerous inquiries from utilities across South East Asia trying to lock in long-term supply deals for newly-built coal-fired plants. But the miners also did express some caution about the outlook for seaborne imports to China and India, the world's two biggest importers. China is trying to limit coal use in order to improve air quality in major cities and India's government has stated that it wants coal imports to drop to zero. While India's aim of zero imports is fanciful, it's possible that it could drop down to a figure closer to 100 million tonnes a year, which would be sufficient to meet its needs for coking coal used to make steel, as well as thermal coal for coastal power plants that were designed to run on imported fuel. This would be a drop of more than 100 million tonnes from the record 206 million India imported in 2015, and well below the 194.6 million last year. A drop of such magnitude would likely outweigh any potential increase in seaborne imports by newer consumers in South East Asia. The future of India's demand for imported coal is far from certain, but the trend seems to be clearer, and that's for lower imports. India's ambitious targets for renewable energy may also crimp its need for more coal-fired power plants in coming years, and the record low prices achieved at recent market auctions for solar power supply show that coal has a fight on its hands. Coal-fired power is still about half the price of liquefied natural gas in most Asian markets, meaning a U.S.-style natural gas revolution is unlikely in power generation. But the rapid rise of renewables, coupled with an increasing focus on cleaner energy means that many Asian countries are likely to face a choice they haven't had before. They can now be cheap and green, whereas before they could either be cheap or green.

The Pacific saw a relatively rapid swing in late October from La Nina conditions - characterized as unusually cold temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean - to neutral or even slightly El Nino-leaning conditions by March. Since then, however, the oceanic and atmospheric signals pointing to a possible El Nino have all weakened.  The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) last week downgraded the probability of El Nino conditions being present in the fourth quarter of 2017, to just 36 percent. That is down from 53 percent at the time of its March forecast. (tmsnrt.rs/2snJmB0) The agency’s central prediction is now that conditions will be neutral in the fourth quarter, with a probability of 53 percent, with only an outlying chance of La Nina, at 11 percent. Sea Temperatures El Nino has a major impact on temperatures and precipitation on countries bordering the Pacific and Indian oceans, and across Latin America, with a smaller impact in some areas of the United States. The phenomenon is typically strongest during the northern hemisphere autumn and winter and weakest during early spring. In winter, El Nino typically brings warmer weather to the U.S. Northwest and cooler, wetter weather to the Southwest and Southeast states. For the purposes of forecasting, meteorologists analyze the surface temperature of the Pacific in a series of boxes stretching from the coast of Peru west along the equator to the international date line and beyond. (tmsnrt.rs/2sXiR2v) The atmospheric and oceanic conditions identified with El Nino and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are most closely associated with temperatures in a composite area called Nino region 3.4. Region 3.4 straddles the equator from 5 degrees north to 5 degrees south and stretches from 120 degrees west to 170 degrees west. (“Why are there so many ENSO indexes, instead of just one?” NOAA, Jan 2015) El Nino is conventionally defined as at least three or sometimes six consecutive months in which the surface temperature in region 3.4 averages 0.5 degrees or more above normal. Surface temperatures in region 3.4 have been rising steadily since October, and are now 0.4 degrees Celsius above the long-term seasonal average, but there are indications they may be peaking. (tmsnrt.rs/2so2JK6) Temperatures further east off the coast of Peru in Nino region 1+2, which stretches from 80 degrees to 90 degrees west, and from the equator to 10 degrees south, have cooled rapidly in the last three months. Surface temperatures in region 1+2 are now 0.1 degrees Celsius below the long-term average, down from 2.6 degrees above the average in mid-March. (tmsnrt.rs/2snQjBZ) Surface temperatures in region 1+2 are usually a good leading indicator for the warmth of water further out in the ocean in region 3.4 given the westward flow of water on the southern equatorial current. (tmsnrt.rs/2rVSdZd) The rapid cooling of water in region 1+2 indicates temperatures in region 3.4 are likely to cool further in the next few weeks, which makes it much less likely a full El Nino episode will develop in the months ahead. Neutral Conditions Other components of ENSO also point to relatively neutral conditions in the near term and mean El Nino will probably not develop before the end of the year. El Nino conditions are normally propagated by an upwelling of warmer than average water from deep down in the ocean off the coast of Peru. But there are currently no signs of warm upwelling. Sub-surface waters off the coast of Peru at depths ranging from about 50 meters to 150 meters are close to the long-term average. The Southern Oscillation, which is the atmospheric counterpart of the El Nino-La Nina cycle, is characterized by variations in atmospheric pressure differentials and wind speeds across the Pacific. El Nino is usually accompanied by a reduction in pressure differentials between the western and eastern sides of the Pacific and a consequent slackening of the trade winds. But both sea-level pressure differences and wind speeds remain close to their long-term averages, according to the latest data. (tmsnrt.rs/2rW82PL and tmsnrt.rs/2snEps1) The conditions for a mutually reinforcing warming of the ocean surface and slackening of the trade winds that characterize a warm episode of ENSO are currently absent.

The inspection system was Egypt's answer to a near year-long row over stringent import requirements, including a ban on the common grain fungus ergot, a policy that halted Egypt's wheat trade last year when trading houses boycotted its state tenders. The suspension, which the government has 15 days to appeal, means the quarantine body that applied the ban will again handle the inspection process both in Egypt and abroad, though it does not necessarily imply a return to zero ergot, the lawyers said.   I have no idea what will happen with ergot, that's for the agriculture ministry to decide,  said Alaa Zaki, one of the lawyers on the case. The new system had stripped the agriculture quarantine body of its inspection powers, and moved the process to the trade ministry's General Organization for Export and Import Control (GOEIC). The case was brought by a group of quarantine inspection employees in their capacity as citizens, not by the body itself, as well as several other parties, including some connected to the health ministry, which also takes part in inspections. They said the new system illegally stripped the quarantine body of its powers and handed it to a trade ministry body ill-equipped to oversee inspections, allowing imports to enter with hazardous contaminants harmful to plant and animal health. Egypt's ban on ergot was reversed last year by a decree that came two months before the new inspection system. That decree is also being challenged in court in a related case, though a ruling could take several months, the lawyers said. 1 Mln Tonne Buying Spree Egypt's state grain buyer GASC has been buying wheat on international markets in recent weeks despite its ongoing local harvest, a time when it typically stops tendering. At a tender on Tuesday GASC bought 300,000 tonnes of wheat from Russia, Romania and Ukraine, taking its purchases to over one million tonnes in under a month. Traders have said the buying spree could signal an intention to stockpile wheat ahead of any fallout from the ruling. Egypt said on Monday it had collected 3.4 million tonnes of wheat from farmers so far during its harvest, which runs through July. It has said it is targeting between 3.5 and 4 million tonnes. GASC told Reuters last week that it intends to continue permitting up to 0.05 percent of ergot in its wheat purchases, a common international standard stipulated in its tender booklet. Egypt baffled traders last year when the agriculture quarantine body began rejecting wheat shipments with trace levels of ergot despite GASC's 0.05 percent permission level as well as reassurances from the ministries of supply and agriculture that they would not apply a zero standard. Tuesday's ruling will restore delegations of inspectors sent by the government to ports of origin abroad. They had been replaced by private companies under the new system.  The quarantine people who filed the case are worried that foreign inspectors don't care about Egypt's crop and the safety of the population,  said Mohamed Zaki, a quarantine inspector.

In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said its output rose by 336,000 barrels per day (bpd) in May to 32.14 million bpd led by a rebound in Nigeria and Libya, which were exempted from supply cuts because unrest had curbed their output. The boost means OPEC is pumping more than its forecast of average global demand for its crude this year, hindering efforts to reduce a glut. But Libyan and Nigerian output remains volatile, meaning the gain may not last. OPEC said oil inventories in industrialized countries dropped in April and would fall further in the rest of the year, but a recovery in U.S. production was slowing efforts to get rid of excess supply.  The rebalancing of the market is under way, but at a slower pace, given the changes in fundamentals since December, especially the shift in U.S. supply from an expected contraction to positive growth,  OPEC said in the report. Oil prices gave up gains on Tuesday after the release of the report to trade toward $48 a barrel, below the $60 level that top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia would like to see and less than half the level of mid-2014. Under the deal to support the market, OPEC is curbing output by about 1.2 million bpd while Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting half as much. With the glut slow to shift, producers agreed in May to prolong the accord until March 2018. In the report, OPEC pointed to continued high compliance by its members with the supply deal and said oil stocks in industrialized nations fell in April - although they are still 251 million barrels above the five-year average. Supply from 11 OPEC members with production targets under the accord - all except Libya and Nigeria - averaged 29.729 million bpd last month, according to figures from secondary sources that OPEC uses to monitor output.  That means OPEC has again complied more than 100 percent with the plan, according to a Reuters calculation. OPEC did not publish a compliance number. Saudi Reports Lower Output Saudi Arabia, which has voluntarily cut production below its OPEC target, told OPEC it lowered output further by about 66,000 bpd in May to 9.88 million bpd. OPEC cut its estimate of oil supply growth from producers outside the group this year to 840,000 bpd from 950,000 bpd, following the decision to extend the curbs. It even trimmed its forecast for growth in the United States, where shale producers have gained impetus from the higher prices brought about by the OPEC-led cut.  U.S. output is still expected to rise by 800,000 bpd in 2017, contributing almost all the non-OPEC gain. Due to the lower supply now expected from all outside producers, OPEC raised the forecast demand for its crude this year by 100,000 bpd to 32.02 million bpd - below its May output. Should the recovery in Nigeria and Libya prove sustainable and others not cut more, the market could remain in surplus. This could lead to calls for Nigeria and Libya's output to be capped - a step OPEC says is too early for now. The OPEC production figures are for 13 members and do not yet include Equatorial Guinea, which joined last month.

Brent crude futures were at $48.25 per barrel at 0039 GMT, down 47 cents, or 1 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $45.94 per barrel, down 52 cents, or 1.1 percent. The price falls came on the back of an ongoing supply glut that has pulled down crude prices by more than 10 percent since late May despite a move led by the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of the first quarter of 2018. OPEC's own compliance with the cuts has been questioned, and the producer group said in a report this week that its output rose by 336,000 bpd in May to 32.14 million bpd. Adding to the glut is an ongoing rise in U.S. production driven by shale drillers, which has pushed U.S. output up by 10 percent over the last year to 9.3 million bpd, not far off top exporter Saudi Arabia. C-OUT-T-EIA  The outlook for oil hinges on the effectiveness of the OPEC cuts relative to the supply increases from U.S. shale,  said William O'Loughlin, analyst at Australia's Rivkin Securities.  Inventory data out last night showed another weekly build in crude inventories despite markets expecting a draw,  he said. Data from the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday that U.S. crude stocks rose by 2.8 million barrels in the week to June 9 to 511.4 million, compared with expectations for a decrease of 2.7 million barrels. With supplies plentiful, strong demand is needed to drive the market, but there are signs of a slowdown. Global energy demand grew by 1 percent in 2016, a rate similar to the previous two years but well below the 10-year average of 1.8 percent, BP said in its benchmark Statistical Review of World Energy on Tuesday. More specifically for oil, there are signs of a slowdown in China, long the key driver in fuel demand growth, as its economy slows down and refiners have produced far too much fuel for the market to consume, forcing a slowdown in activity.  Chinese demand is slow... so we have a build-up of crude in Asia where demand seems to have slowed for now,  said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

Thousands of people could die in the coming months with up to 300,000 cases predicted, Save the Children said, adding that the infection rate had tripled in a fortnight.  Two years of civil war, near-famine conditions and a lack of access to clean water have exacerbated the spread of cholera - a diarrheal disease that can kill within hours. The country's health system - already on its knees - is reeling with hospitals overwhelmed and quickly running out of medicines and intravenous fluids.  The U.N. children's agency UNICEF said more than 920 people had died from the disease since late April and more than 124,000 cases had been recorded – almost half of them children.  Grant Pritchard, Save the Children's representative in Yemen, called for an increase in emergency funding to tackle the epidemic.  It's time for the world to take action before thousands of Yemeni boys and girls perish from an entirely preventable disease,  he said in a statement.  Disease, starvation and war are causing a perfect storm of disaster for Yemen's people. The region's poorest country is on the verge of total collapse, and children are dying because they're not able to access basic healthcare.  Yemen's civil war, pitting the Iran-allied Houthi group against a Western-backed Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia, has left 19 million people needing humanitarian aid with many on the verge of famine. More than 2 million children are acutely malnourished making them particularly vulnerable to cholera as their weakened systems are less able to fight off disease, Save the Children said. Pritchard said restrictions on bringing aid and medical supplies into Yemen, including delays accessing Hodeidah port and the closure of Sanaa airport, were compounding difficulties in halting the epidemic. Unaffordable transport is also making it hard for people to reach treatment. One man told the charity he had been forced to seek help for his children in the capital Sanaa, more than 200 km (125 miles) from his home, because his local hospital was full. The trip had cost 35,000 Yemen rial ($140). A nurse at a Sanaa cholera unit said there was one day when they had received more than 550 cases.  Every hour we receive patients. We work here 24 hours. People come from all governorates across the country,  the nurse added.  I have come across many sad stories.

Donnie Rowe, 43, and Ricky Dubose, 24, both serving time for armed robbery, escaped around 5:45 a.m. in rural Putnam County, about 70 miles (110 km) southeast of Atlanta, as they were being transported between two prison facilities with 31 other inmates, authorities said. One of the inmates disarmed and fatally shot both  correctional officers before the two prisoners made off with .40-caliber Glock pistols from the slain guards, commandeered a passenger car that was stopped nearby and fled the scene, according to police and corrections officials. The driver of the carjacked vehicle was not hurt. All the remaining inmates who were aboard the bus remained in custody, law enforcement officials said. Hours later, the pair broke into a home in Madison, Georgia, where they stole clothing and left their white prison uniforms behind, authorities said. The local sheriff addressed the fugitives directly via Facebook.  You made your escape, but you won't be out long,  Oconee County Sheriff Scott Berry said in a statement.

Sessions, a senior member of Trump's Cabinet and an adviser to his election team, had a series of tense exchanges with Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee during about 2-1/2 hours of high-stakes testimony as they pressed him to recount discussions with the Republican president.  You raised your right hand here today and said you would solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,  Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich said.  Now you're not answering questions. You're impeding this investigation.  Sessions refused to say whether he and Trump discussed FBI director James Comey's handling of an investigation into possible coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia during the election campaign before the president fired Comey on May 9. He declined to say whether Trump expressed concern over Sessions' decision in March to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, and he refused to say if Justice Department officials discussed possible presidential pardons of individuals being looked at in the probe. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden told Sessions,  I believe the American people have had it with stonewalling. Americans don't want to hear that answers to relevant questions are privileged.   I am not stonewalling,  Sessions replied, saying he was simply following Justice Department policy not to discuss confidential communications with the president. Sessions' testimony did not provide damaging new information on any Trump campaign ties with Russia or on Comey's firing, but his refusal to discuss conversations with Trump raised fresh questions about whether the White House has something to hide. Last week, Comey told the same Senate committee that Trump had fired him to undermine the FBI's investigation of the Russia matter. Sessions had recommended that Comey be fired, and Trump's decision prompted critics to charge that the president was trying to interfere with a criminal investigation. Sessions on Tuesday defended his involvement in Comey's firing despite recusing himself from the Russia probe. Senator Angus King, an independent, questioned Sessions' legal basis for refusing to answer questions after Sessions said Trump had not invoked executive privilege regarding the conversations. Executive privilege is a power that can be claimed by a president or senior executive branch officials to withhold information from Congress or the courts to protect the executive branch decision-making process. Sessions said it would be  inappropriate  for him to reveal private conversations with Trump when the president  has not had a full opportunity to review the questions and to make a decision on whether or not to approve such an answer.  'Appalling and Detestable Lie' Sessions' clash with the Democratic senators was the latest chapter in a saga that has dogged Trump's first five months as president and distracted from his domestic policy agenda including major healthcare and tax cut initiatives.  The suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie,  Sessions said.  I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected with the Trump campaign.  U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a report released in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to interfere in the election to help Trump in part by hacking and releasing damaging emails about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Russia has denied any such interference, and Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign with Moscow. Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation in March after revelations that he had failed to disclose two meetings last year with Russia's ambassador to Washington, Sergei Kislyak. In his testimony on Tuesday, Sessions addressed media reports that he may have had a third previously undisclosed meeting with Kislyak at Washington's Mayflower Hotel last year. Sessions said he did not have any private meetings and could not recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the hotel but did not rule out that a  brief interaction  with Kislyak may have occurred there. Sessions, a Republican former senator, was an early supporter of Trump's presidential campaign. But there has been tension between the two men in recent weeks because Trump was annoyed that Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe. Sessions said on Tuesday he did not recuse himself because he felt he was a subject of the investigation himself but rather because he felt he was required to by Justice Department rules.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was flat at 97.007. Against the yen, the dollar was steady on the day at 110.11 , while the euro was also unchanged at $1.1210. The Fed is scheduled to announce its monetary policy decision at 2 p.m. eastern time (1800 GMT) on Wednesday at the end of a two-day policy meeting, and may also provide more clues on how it plans to reduce its holdings of more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Economists polled by Reuters overwhelmingly see the U.S. central bank hiking its benchmark rate to a target range of 1.00 to 1.25 percent this week, though expectations for further rate increases are fading. What emerges from the Fed meeting  is certainly going to chart the course for a lot, including the strength of the dollar,  said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the private client group of U.S. Bank in Helena, Montana, who spoke from Minneapolis.  There is some risk that we could see a more dovish outlook,  he said. Fed funds futures on Tuesday suggested traders saw about a 29 percent chance of rates rising to 1.25-1.50 percent at the Fed's Sept. 19-20 meeting, and a 57 percent chance of such a move at its Dec. 12-13 meeting .

Although there was regret at the cost to Taiwan, an ally of various Central American nations, there was broad support for President Juan Carlos Varela's decision to throw his lot in with China, whose growing global ambitions contrast with U.S. President Donald Trump's isolationist rhetoric.  I'm sure it wasn't an easy decision, given the long-term links we've had with Taiwan, but nonetheless, (China) is a global superpower, the world's No. 2 economy, the second biggest user of the canal - and so we think this is a positive development that will result in more business and investment in Panama,  said Inocencio Galindo, president of Panama's Trade, Industry and Agriculture chamber. The diplomatic U-turn comes as China attempts to position itself as a defender of free trade in the face of the  America First  policy of Trump, who was elected in November 2016. Chinese officials also celebrated the news. Wang Weihua, the permanent representative in the Office of China-Panama Trade Development and Beijing's top representative in the country, said various attempts had been made over the years without success to establish formal ties. Late last year, more advanced talks began with Varela's team that concluded only this week, said Wang, who added he was involved in the discussions. China is interested in Panama for its strategic location, and as a trade and logistics hub, he added.  China has made a big bet on Latin America, where it has strategic investments, and Panama, which didn't have diplomatic relations, was losing out on those advantages,  he said in an interview.  Now Panama will be able to enjoy what our country can offer it in various sectors.

Although there was regret at the cost to Taiwan, an ally of various Central American nations, there was broad support for President Juan Carlos Varela's decision to throw his lot in with China, whose growing global ambitions contrast with U.S. President Donald Trump's isolationist rhetoric.  I'm sure it wasn't an easy decision, given the long-term links we've had with Taiwan, but nonetheless, (China) is a global superpower, the world's No. 2 economy, the second biggest user of the canal - and so we think this is a positive development that will result in more business and investment in Panama,  said Inocencio Galindo, president of Panama's Trade, Industry and Agriculture chamber. The diplomatic U-turn comes as China attempts to position itself as a defender of free trade in the face of the  America First  policy of Trump, who was elected in November 2016. Chinese officials also celebrated the news. Wang Weihua, the permanent representative in the Office of China-Panama Trade Development and Beijing's top representative in the country, said various attempts had been made over the years without success to establish formal ties. Late last year, more advanced talks began with Varela's team that concluded only this week, said Wang, who added he was involved in the discussions. China is interested in Panama for its strategic location, and as a trade and logistics hub, he added.  China has made a big bet on Latin America, where it has strategic investments, and Panama, which didn't have diplomatic relations, was losing out on those advantages,  he said in an interview.  Now Panama will be able to enjoy what our country can offer it in various sectors.  Almost a fifth of the cargo crossing the isthmus last year went to or from China, which has been taking an increasing interest in the Panama Canal.

Speaking ahead of Trump’s expected trip to Miami on Friday to announce his new Cuba policy, Tillerson insisted that Havana  must begin to address human rights challenges  if it wants Washington to continue normalizing relations between the Cold War-era foes. Tillerson, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, acknowledged that rapprochement with the communist-ruled island has led to an increase in U.S. visitors and U.S. business ties. However, Tillerson added:  We think we have achieved very little in terms of changing the behavior of the regime in Cuba .... and it has little incentive today to change that.  His comments came as Trump’s aides sought to finalize rules that, according to U.S. officials and people familiar with the discussions, are likely to bar U.S. trade with Cuban enterprises linked to the military – which controls a large part of the economy – and tighten some rules on Americans traveling there.  But the new policy will stop short of closing embassies or breaking off relations re-established in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility, the sources said. In his speech, Trump is expected to claim fulfillment of a campaign promise to the Cuban-American community to tighten the screws on the government of Cuban President Raul Castro. While Tillerson declined to confirm any details, he left no doubt that the Trump administration was prepared to undo some pieces of Obama’s policy that it sees as boosting the Cuban government financially, which would violate U.S. law. “As we're developing these business relationships and as we're enjoying the benefits on the economic and development side, are we inadvertently or directly providing financial support to the regime? Our view is we are,” Tillerson said. “And the question is ... how how do we bring that back into compliance with longstanding statutory obligations” he said. A man looks out of the window of his apartment across from the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba June 13, 2017.Stringer Dark Side  Many of Trump's fellow Republicans, and some Democrats, objected to Obama's policy shift, saying he gave too much for too few concessions from Cuba. But Obama’s measures have proven popular with the public, U.S. businesses and many lawmakers from both parties. Tillerson agreed that moves toward more normal relations with the United States have helped some Cubans lift themselves out of poverty and provided opportunities for U.S. companies. However, Tillerson said there is a  dark side  to relations with Cuba, noting that the government in Havana continues to jail political opponents and harass dissidents.  We are supportive of the continued economic development, as long as it is done in full compliance with our existing statutes to not provide financial support to the regime,  Tillerson said.  That's the focus of our current policy review.  But divisions remain within the Trump administration over how far to go. Some aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. business and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a promise to Cuban-Americans whose support they considered significant in winning Florida in the 2016 election. Miami is home to the largest Cuban-American community. One proposal under consideration, according to the U.S. sources, would tighten enforcement to make sure Americans legally fit the authorized categories they claim to be traveling under. Another tougher change being weighed would revert to regulations requiring at least some types of U.S. travelers to seek a special license to travel to Cuba. However, airline officials say they do not expect the Trump administration to revoke any flights to Cuba approved by the Obama administration but said new measures to restrict visits to Cuba could result in less demand for seats.

Some 20,000 people in the Olympic Stadium cheered as each of the players, dressed in the red wine colored  Vinotinto  national strip, was welcomed on stage.  But for a short period before the event began, much of the crowd shouted a popular anti-government slogan, with the chants surging again several times during the ceremony.   It's going to fall, it's going to fall, this government is going to fall!  the fans sang at the stadium in Caracas. At one point, the chants became so loud that team coach Rafael Dudamel pleaded with the crowd to quieten down, saying from the stage:  Nobody should steal this moment from us.    Protesters demanding elections, along with an end to food and medicine shortages, have stormed the streets of Caracas and other cities almost every day since early April.  At least 68 people have died in the often violent demonstrations, including protesters, government supporters, bystanders and members of the security forces.

Unusually for such an event, Tuesday's homage was not broadcast live on the main state television channel, which instead showed Maduro at an event with army officials. Earlier the team's arrival at the airport was broadcast.  The youth side unexpectedly reached the Under-20 World Cup final in South Korea, the strongest ever performance for a soccer side from a country where baseball has long been the national sport. Slideshow (4 Images)Although beaten by England in the final, the players' success has created a rare moment of joint pride amid the bitter political divide and violence.   Even though they lost, they are our champions. This is the greatest achievement in our football history and we will not forget,  said architecture student Roberto Hernandez, 22.  This country needs some happiness and these kids gave us spadefuls of that every time they won a game.  Though coach Dudamel was judicious in his words on Tuesday, he irked the government last week when, after a semi-final victory, he called on Maduro to  stop the weapons  and lamented the death of a 17-year-old protester. The violence was unabated on Tuesday, with a 45-year-old police officer shot dead during a demonstration in the mountain state of Merida. State governor Alexis Ramirez condemned the death as an act of  hooded terrorists  who shot at police, injuring two more plus two students.

At a committee hearing, he also defended President Donald Trump's plans for steep reductions in U.S. spending on diplomacy and foreign aid. Senators from both major parties charged that such cuts would ultimately hurt America. At the start Tillerson told lawmakers that North Korea had released Otto Warmbier, a U.S. university student held captive for 17 months, and the United States was seeking the release of three other detained Americans.  Washington has sought to increase economic and political pressure on Pyongyang because of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The North has conducted five nuclear tests and is believed to be making progress toward an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the United States. Tillerson said Washington is discussing North Korea with all of its allies, and seeing some response from China, its biggest trading partner. He said North Korea would top the agenda at  next week's high-level talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. Related CoverageTillerson says working to bring stability to Russia tiesU.S. will have to work with others to deny North Korea fuel supplies: TillersonTillerson said the United States would have to work with other countries to deny North Korea access to basics such as oil and will have to consider whether to impose sanctions on those doing business with North Korea.  We are in a stage where we are moving into this next effort of, 'Are we going to have to, in effect, start taking secondary  sanctions because countries we have provided information to  have not, or are unwilling, or don’t have the ability to do that?'  Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Because the United States has no trade with the North, its strongest way to impose economic pressure is through  secondary sanctions  that threaten companies from third countries with losing access to the U.S. market if they deal with Pyongyang. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson testifies before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 13, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinTies With Russia at a Low Asked whether the United States wanted to see an Iran-style global embargo to deny exports of petroleum and other products to North Korea, Tillerson said that this would only work if Russia and China, the North's main suppliers, cooperated. Tillerson repeated his view that U.S. relations with Russia  were at an all time-low and still deteriorating. Ties have been strained by differences over Syria, Ukraine and allegations, denied by Moscow, of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Slideshow (2 Images)He said the administration was trying to find a way to re-establish a working relationship, notably on Syria. It took years of diplomacy with Russia and China to achieve consensus among major powers to impose the sanctions on Iran and a similar result with the North seems unlikely given Beijing's reluctance to destabilize its neighbors. Asked if China had lived up to its pledges to crack down on the North, Tillerson said its actions had been  uneven,  but added:  They have taken steps, visible steps that we can confirm. We are in discussions with them about entities inside of China.  The purpose of Tillerson's appearance, his first of four congressional hearings this week, was to discuss the budget. In all, the Trump proposal cuts about 32 percent from U.S. diplomacy and aid budgets, or nearly $19 billion. Committee members, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans, spoke sharply against the plan. Republicans control both houses of Congress, which sets the federal government budget. Separately, 16 retired senior generals and other ex-military officers said they would submit joint testimony to the Senate on Wednesday about the importance of foreign aid to national security.

The new bid, being arranged by the Ministry for the Economy, Trade and Industry, groups government lenders Development Bank of Japan and Innovation Network Corp of Japan. It would exceed the 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) minimum sought by struggling Toshiba, the newspaper said, citing an unnamed source. INCJ, DBJ and U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital LP would each invest 300 billion yen in a special-purpose company to buy Toshiba Memory Corp. Toshiba itself would contribute up to 100 billion yen and other Japanese firms a combined 140 billion yen, while U.S. investment firm KKR & Co LP is considering putting in 100 billion yen, the Asahi said. South Korea's SK Hynix Inc would lend 300 billion yen to the project and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ 400 billion yen, it said. A person familiar with the matter said Hynix was involved in the bid, while another person briefed on the matter said the Asahi report was essentially correct but he could not provide details.

Speaking ahead of Trump’s expected trip to Miami on Friday to announce his new Cuba policy, Tillerson insisted that Havana  must begin to address human rights challenges  if it wants Washington to continue normalizing relations between the Cold War-era foes. Tillerson, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, acknowledged that rapprochement with the communist-ruled island has led to an increase in U.S. visitors and U.S. business ties. However, Tillerson added:  We think we have achieved very little in terms of changing the behavior of the regime in Cuba .... and it has little incentive today to change that.  His comments came as Trump’s aides sought to finalize rules that, according to U.S. officials and people familiar with the discussions, are likely to bar U.S. trade with Cuban enterprises linked to the military – which controls a large part of the economy – and tighten some rules on Americans traveling there.  But the new policy will stop short of closing embassies or breaking off relations re-established in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility, the sources said. In his speech, Trump is expected to claim fulfillment of a campaign promise to the Cuban-American community to tighten the screws on the government of Cuban President Raul Castro. While Tillerson declined to confirm any details, he left no doubt that the Trump administration was prepared to undo some pieces of Obama’s policy that it sees as boosting the Cuban government financially, which would violate U.S. law. “As we're developing these business relationships and as we're enjoying the benefits on the economic and development side, are we inadvertently or directly providing financial support to the regime? Our view is we are,” Tillerson said. “And the question is ... how how do we bring that back into compliance with longstanding statutory obligations” he said. A man looks out of the window of his apartment across from the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba June 13, 2017.Stringer Dark Side  Many of Trump's fellow Republicans, and some Democrats, objected to Obama's policy shift, saying he gave too much for too few concessions from Cuba. But Obama’s measures have proven popular with the public, U.S. businesses and many lawmakers from both parties. Tillerson agreed that moves toward more normal relations with the United States have helped some Cubans lift themselves out of poverty and provided opportunities for U.S. companies. However, Tillerson said there is a  dark side  to relations with Cuba, noting that the government in Havana continues to jail political opponents and harass dissidents.  We are supportive of the continued economic development, as long as it is done in full compliance with our existing statutes to not provide financial support to the regime,  Tillerson said.  That's the focus of our current policy review.  But divisions remain within the Trump administration over how far to go. Some aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. business and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a promise to Cuban-Americans whose support they considered significant in winning Florida in the 2016 election. Miami is home to the largest Cuban-American community. One proposal under consideration, according to the U.S. sources, would tighten enforcement to make sure Americans legally fit the authorized categories they claim to be traveling under. Another tougher change being weighed would revert to regulations requiring at least some types of U.S. travelers to seek a special license to travel to Cuba. However, airline officials say they do not expect the Trump administration to revoke any flights to Cuba approved by the Obama administration but said new measures to restrict visits to Cuba could result in less demand for seats.

Some 800,000 Afghans have been sent back from Pakistan and Iran, many of them left to rely on subsistence income in rural areas or low-paid work in towns.

The mostly Muslim countries of Indonesia and Malaysia, and  those with sizeable Muslim minorities, like the Philippines, have been on high alert for fighters returning home from Islamic State frontlines in Syria and Iraq. So when dozens of Malaysians, Indonesians, Arabs and Chechens showed up in Marawi City on Mindanao island, fighting alongside a Philippine franchise of Islamic State, a nightmare scenario suddenly took shape.  The danger of global jihadis establishing a base in the Philippines, running satellite cells to launch attacks across Southeast Asia, made governments in the region realize just how vulnerable they could be.  It's easy to jump from Marawi to Indonesia and we must all beware of sleeper cells being activated in Indonesia,  General Gatot Nurmantyo, Indonesia's military chief said on Monday. According to the general, there are Islamic State sleeper cells in almost all of Indonesia's 34 provinces. Indonesia has called for a conference with the Philippines and Malaysia to discuss events in Marawi - where the Philippine military, backed by U.S. special forces are still battling after more than three weeks to retake the town from fighters led by the IS-inspired Maute brothers. So far, Islamic State-inspired attacks have been relatively small-scale in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest Muslim population. But they have become more frequent. Last month, suicide bombers killed three police officers at a Jakarta bus station. Malaysia, meanwhile, has used draconian security laws to detain scores of suspected militants and Islamic State sympathizers.  Air and Sea   Next week, the three countries, with Singapore's assistance, will begin joint air surveillance over the Sulu Sea, using reconnaissance planes and drones, and enhance joint naval patrols. [nL3N1J109N] Their navies planned joint patrols last year after a spate of kidnappings by Abu Sayyaf, a well established militant group that has declared support for Islamic State. But there are plenty of gaps to fill.  We don't have communications via radio at this point. We conduct patrols in our own territory. We have not discussed exchanging personnel,  said First Admiral Ferial Fachroni, commander of Indonesia's Tarakan naval base in North Kalimantan. He told Reuters joint operations would begin this month. Situated on Borneo's northeast coast, Tarakan is the nearest Indonesian naval base to kidnappers' hunting grounds in the Celebes and Sulu Seas. Keeping tabs on hundreds of merchant ships, fishing boats and ferries plying routes between the islands, deciding when and who to stop and search will be a tall order even for three navies working together. The archipelagos' heavily forested coves and inlets provide excellent cover for any fast vessel looking to escape closer scrutiny.  The Sulu Sea area has always had sporadic incidents like kidnappings of tourists before, but starting last year and this year, it has really gone up,  Noel Chung, the Kuala Lumpur-based Asia head of the International Maritime Bureau, said.  They started off with tugboats and went on to merchant ships, so they're targeting big ships out at sea. It's different from years ago when the attacks were more localized.  Chung saw comparisons with the Gulf of Aden, where Somali pirates operate, but the difference is that the Sulu Sea is not a major trading route so the international community is disinclined to invest in providing security. Experts say the number of vessels needed to police the seas and costs incurred would be prohibitive.        Weak Link  Despite the long history of militancy and banditry in the area, it has taken the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia a long time to pool resources.  Largely dormant territorial disputes, mutual mistrust, and limited capabilities have all played a part retarding closer cooperation. But seeing the black flags of Islamic State raised in Mindanao could have shocked the region's governments into moving from cooperation to actual collaboration.  There are still some lingering trust issues but now there is also an understanding of the consequences if they don't develop this collaboration,  said Singapore-based security analyst Rohan Gunaratna. Beyond enhancing air and sea patrols, the countries' security agencies need to coordinate better and act faster on shared intelligence.  A Malaysian government official said that while information was shared on militant suspects, there was some frustration over a perceived lack of follow up in the Philippines.  One of the challenges is tracking militants once they're in the southern Philippines. Only the Philippine army can confront them on land,  the Malaysian official said, declining to be  identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Philippine officials said security agencies are  doing everything  to address the surge in militancy in Muslim-majority areas of the mostly Catholic country.      This is a holistic effort, not only in the military but in the government,  armed forces chief General Eduardo Ano told reporters last week. Describing the Philippines as a  weak link , regional terrorism expert Sidney Jones criticized a lack of cooperation between its police, military and intelligence agency.   More so than other Southeast Asian countries, the security agencies are completely silo-ized,  Jones said.    The fact that the Philippines has been dealing with insurgencies for so long meant that it's somewhat blinded to this new phenomenon of pro-IS groups,  she added.

He said he has been in contact several times with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to assure him the U.S. military base in Qatar, Al Udeid, would not be affected by the crisis. Otaiba said the measures against Qatar were not an attempt to have the base moved  but if anyone asks we'd be willing to have that conversation.  He pointed out a defense accord that the United States and the UAE signed last month would allow Washington send more troops and equipment there. Moving U.S. air operations would involve a massive undertaking by the U.S. military, which coordinates its air campaigns in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan from Qatar.

He said they would broadly address the three areas of support for terrorism, meddling in the internal affairs of these countries and attacks through Qatari-owned media platforms.

Erdogan's comments marked the strongest intervention yet by a powerful regional ally of Doha eight days after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar and applied stringent economic sanctions on it. Later on Tuesday, the UAE ambassador to the United States, which has an air base in Qatar, said there was no military component to the steps taken against Doha. Qatar denies accusations that it supports Islamist militants and Shi'ite Iran, arch regional foe of the Sunni Gulf Arab monarchies.  A very grave mistake is being made in Qatar; isolating a nation in all areas is inhumane and against Islamic values. It's as if a death penalty decision has been taken for Qatar,  Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party in Ankara.   Qatar has shown the most decisive stance against the terrorist organization Islamic State alongside Turkey. Victimizing Qatar through smear campaigns serves no purpose.  The measures against Qatar, a small oil and gas exporter with a population of 2.7 million people, have disrupted imports of food and other materials and caused some foreign banks to scale back business. The UAE envoy, Yousef Al Otaiba, told reporters in Washington:  There is absolutely no military component to anything that we are doing.   I have spoken and seen (U.S. Defense Secretary) General (Jim) Mattis four times in the last week; we’ve given them our complete assurance that the steps we have taken will not affect in anyway Al Udeid base or any operations supporting or regarding the base,  Otaiba said. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is home to more than 11,000 U.S. and coalition forces and an important base for the fight against Islamic State militants in the region.

Qatar, which imported 80 percent of its food from bigger Gulf Arab neighbors before the diplomatic shutdown, has been talking to Iran and Turkey to secure food and water. The world's second largest helium producer, Qatar has also shut its two helium production plants because of the economic boycott, industry sources told Reuters on Tuesday. Turkey has maintained good relations with Qatar as well as several of its Gulf Arab neighbors. Turkey and Qatar have both provided support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and backed rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi also criticized the measures imposed on Qatar, saying in Baghdad on Tuesday they were hurting the emirate's people, not its rulers.

Yasin Bulbul/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERSSaudi Food Supplies? Gulf Arab states have issued no public demands to Qatar, but a list that has been circulating includes severing diplomatic ties with Iran, expulsion of all members of the Palestinian Hamas group and the Muslim Brotherhood, the freezing of all bank accounts of Hamas members, ending support for  terrorist organizations  and ending interference in Egyptian affairs. Some analysts say demands could also include closing down  satellite channel Al Jazeera, or changing its editorial policy. When asked what, if any, further steps would be taken against Qatar, the UAE's Otaiba said:  We’ve designated 59 people and 12 entities; it’s likely that you could see designations of their bank accounts, and perhaps of the banks themselves.   The specific list is being drawn up and the reason it has not been completed and passed on yet is because there’s four countries involved,  he added.  Each country has their own set of lists, their own specifications and so we’re trying to compile and curate that into one master list and it should be handed over to the United States fairly soon.  Slideshow (9 Images)Otaiba reiterated the accusations that Qatar was supporting terrorism.  Doha has become a financial, media and ideological hub for extremism. Then it must take decisive action to deal once and for all with its extremist problem,  he wrote in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal published on Monday night. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, talking to reporters during a news conference in Washington on Tuesday with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said Riyadh was ready to send food and medical supplies to Qatar. The minister, Adel al-Jubeir, defended the Arab powers' move against Qatar as a boycott, not a blockade, adding:  We have allowed the movement of families between the two countries ... so that we don’t divide families.  There has been no breakthrough in Kuwaiti efforts to mediate in the crisis, but a U.S. official in the region said Kuwait was continuing with what is seen as a  slow, painstaking, deliberate  process focused inside the Gulf Cooperation Council.  The parties are still defining what it is they want out of this confrontation ... It's difficult to conduct negotiations if you don't really know what everybody wants.  International Diplomacy Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdulrahman al-Thani said on Monday that Doha  still had no clue  why Arab states had cut ties. He denied Doha supported groups like the Muslim Brotherhood that its neighbors oppose, or had warm ties with their enemy Iran. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Erdogan would discuss the Gulf rift in a telephone call with U.S. President Donald Trump in coming days. Turkey approved plans last week to deploy more troops to a military base it has established in Qatar under a 2014 agreement with the Gulf Arab state. The move was seen as support by regional power and NATO member Turkey to Doha. In Moscow, the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia's King Salman discussed the crisis in a phone call on Tuesday. The Kremlin said the dispute was not helping to unite efforts to try to find a Syria settlement or fight terrorism.

The panel decided that the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission(JADCO), who brought the charges, could not prove that 30-year-old Spencer had been properly notified under World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) rules that she was required for testing. The decision means the 2009 world championship 4x400m relay silver medallist can compete in Jamaica's National Senior Championship (June 22-25), which will be used to select the Caribbean island's team for the Aug. 4-13 worlds in London.

Razak Iyal and Seidu Mohammed entered Canada on Christmas Eve, after walking for three hours and awaiting help for hours more in frigid temperatures. On Tuesday, Iyal, 34, was granted refugee status in Canada by an Immigration and Refugee Board in Winnipeg. Mohammed argued his claim successfully in May.  I'm feeling great, so happy,  Iyal said after his hearing.  Look what happened to me, to both of us. This changed our lives totally. Here is going to be my new home.  More than 2,700 asylum seekers have walked into Canada since January, avoiding formal border crossings where they would be turned back under the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement. Those who cross without authorization, however, are entitled to receive an asylum hearing. Many say they left the United States because they feared President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. A Ghanaian woman died of possible hypothermia in Minnesota in May trying to enter Canada, highlighting the risks migrants take. Iyal left Ghana after multiple beatings and death threats related to a family dispute about his father's estate. Mohammed, 25, a former professional soccer player in Ghana, said he was threatened there because of his bisexuality.  It's been happening in Ghana - people killing people for stupid things, and the police take no action,  Iyal said. The men traveled, separately, to the United States, which rejected their asylum claims last year, prompting them to flee to Canada. But they both paid a hard price. A taxi they hired in Minneapolis dropped the men in North Dakota far from the border. The pair struggled through waist-deep snow in farmers' fields and lost their gloves along the way. Once the men reached Manitoba on Dec. 24, their fingers were too frozen to dial for help. Disoriented, they huddled together on a highway for hours before help arrived. Doctors amputated all of Mohammed's fingers and thumbs. Iyal lost his fingers, but kept his thumbs. The Winnipeg refugee agency group home that Iyal lives in tried to make life easier, replacing door knobs with latches, attaching bungee cords to dresser drawer knobs and installing a bidet toilet.  It's very, very hard,  Iyal said.  We spent our life with our fingers. (Losing them) changed our lives totally.

The rebels are expected to complete the second tranche of the handover on Wednesday.  It's a historic day,  said Santos, who has staked his legacy on bringing peace to Colombia.   Peace will be built little by little, in fact, it is like building a cathedral, it is brick by brick,  Santos said from the city of Cali after he was unable to reach a weapons handover ceremony in Cauca province due to bad weather. The deadline for disarmament was recently extended after logistical delays slowed the arrival of some of the group's 7,000 fighters to special demobilization zones.  The remaining 40 percent are due to be relinquished by June 20, the expiry date of the extension with the government.  This is another demonstration of our true commitment in the construction of peace,  the FARC said on Twitter after a ceremony.

Otting,Keith Noreika,Martin Gruenberg,Quyen Huu Truong,Randal Quarles,Richard Cordray,Sherrod Brown,Steven T. Mnuchin,USA,BANKS/REGULATION,TRUMP,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"Washington (Reuters) - Wall Street banks on Tuesday cheered U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to loosen the leash put on them in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis but they do not expect significant change any time soon. The Trump administration has said the bulk of its plan for overhauling bank regulation can be done via executive order and through regulators, rather than requiring legislation from Congress. But Trump is months away from installing top officials at key regulatory posts to carry out his agenda.  We won't see policy changes before the end of the year,  said Rich Foster, senior counsel for regulatory and legal affairs at the Financial Services Roundtable, a trade group. Trump has gradually been nominating heads of financial agencies, but only Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton have been approved by Congress. Other agencies are either awaiting presidential picks or are operating under  acting  chiefs. Others have leaders appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama. The Federal Reserve has already signaled it will make its stress testing of banks more transparent and is considering other steps to simplify the process, in line with Treasury's recommendations. But the Treasury called for even more significant changes, including having the Fed overhaul its testing models and assumptions. Such changes may have to wait until the administration has appointed a vice chair in charge of banking oversight at the Fed. Randal Quarles, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration, is expected to be Trump's pick for the Fed's top bank regulator, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. He has not been named publicly while he is being vetted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Government Ethics. Once he is named, he will have to be confirmed by the Senate -- a process that could easily slide into the fall with Congress facing a busy calendar and an upcoming five-week congressional recess from the end of July to the beginning of September. Analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank, has found that since 1989, it has taken an average of 149 days for a financial regulatory nominee to receive Senate confirmation after being announced. Quarles has declined to comment on speculation about the possible nomination. Meanwhile, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is being managed by an interim Trump pick, Keith Noreika, while the Senate considers Joseph Otting for the top role. Otting was nominated earlier this month, but could face a contentious confirmation. Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee that will consider the pick, has already announced his opposition, citing his time as an executive at OneWest Bank and that firm's foreclosure practices. In addition to Clayton at the SEC, Christopher Giancarlo, the acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is already in position, awaiting full confirmation to take on the role full-time. But at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Obama appointee Martin Gruenberg intends to serve his full term, which expires in November. Treasury's plans to ease some of the restrictions around banks' trading, living wills and their adherence to international banking accords could face resistance from him, given his role in drafting many existing rules. An FDIC spokesperson declined to comment. The Treasury report also focuses significant attention on overhauling mortgage rules. But that would require cooperation from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which wrote many of them. That agency's Obama-appointed director, Richard Cordray, has a term that does not expire until summer 2018. The CFPB, created in the wake of the financial crisis, receives its funding through the Federal Reserve and Trump can only fire Cordray  for cause,  an almost impossible standard to meet. That leaves few levers the administration can pull to get the agency to reorganize its internal operations or make the suggested changes on mortgages. Cordray will probably do nothing more than subject Trump's proposals to  long-term analysis,  said Quyen Truong, a partner at law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, which in Washington means he will shelve it. Truong was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the CFPB until early 2016.  The changes proposed by the study go to fundamental aspects of the CFPB's philosophy and operations,  she said.  The CFPB likely will not confront directly those proposals.  A CFPB spokesperson said the agency was reviewing the report, but had no further comment at this time. A Treasury spokesperson maintained the administration would be working quickly on its recommendations even as some key posts await Trump picks.  We have strong working relationships with the regulators and considerable dialogue is already underway,  said a Treasury spokesperson.  We plan on working with them to begin swiftly advancing these recommendations. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-banks-regulation-trump-idUSL1N1JA2A3"},

The Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, which was implicated in the 2014 story, which was retracted, said it would donate a significant portion of the settlement proceeds to groups providing services to combat sexual assault on college campuses. No other terms of the agreement were provided in the fraternity's online announcement of the deal but a spokesman for Phi Kappa Psi, Brian Ellis, confirmed the sum to be paid in return for dismissal of the suit was $1.65 million. The original lawsuit sought $25 million in damages. Rolling Stone representatives declined comment except to say the settlement had just been reached and has not yet been entered in court. The fraternity's defamation claims against the magazine and the article's author, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, had been due to go to trial in October. The settlement brings to an end the last of several lawsuits sparked by the  A Rape on Campus  article, which described the alleged sexual assault on a freshman woman during a fraternity party at the University of Virginia's Charlottesville campus in 2012. The article stoked a national debate about sexual assault on U.S. college campuses, where by some estimates one in five female students will become a victim before graduating, and fueled perceptions of fraternity culture as dangerously permissive and predatory. But the published story, based on the account of a female student identified only as  Jackie,  was ultimately discredited as the magazine admitted it never sought comment from the seven men accused of the alleged rape. The story was officially retracted in April 2015, and an outside review concluded that Rolling Stone failed to follow basic journalistic safeguards in its reporting. A separate defamation case brought against the magazine by university administrator Nicole Eramo was settled two months ago after a federal court jury awarded her $3 million in damages. Another lawsuit by three former fraternity members was dismissed by a federal judge in June 2016.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/virginia-rollingstone-idUSL1N1JA29Z"},

May's team will resume talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) on a deal to secure their support in parliament after the 60-year-old leader failed to win an outright majority in last week's election - a vote she called expecting to strengthen her position. Instead, the shock outcome has left May weakened among her Conservative Party and thrown open her Brexit strategy to criticism from peers, some of whom want to ditch the current plan to leave the European Union single market and customs union. May said on Tuesday that talks with the DUP had been productive - a view shared by DUP leader Arlene Foster - and that Brexit negotiations would begin as planned next week.  I think there is a unity of purpose among people in the United Kingdom,  May said following a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday.  It's a unity of purpose, having voted to leave the EU, that their government gets on with that and makes a success of it.  But pressure was mounting for May to change course on the type of Brexit Britain should pursue. The Times newspaper said finance minister Philip Hammond would push May not to leave the customs union - an arrangement which guarantees tariff-free trade within the bloc but prohibits members from striking third-party trade deals. The report cited unnamed sources, and the finance ministry declined to comment. Nevertheless, it illustrated the challenge May will face in the remaining days before the EU divorce talks begin: finding a position that satisfies both pro-European and eurosceptic factions of her party if she wants to remain in power. Dup Talks May will also be reliant upon the 10 lawmakers from the eurosceptic DUP, who would help her edge past the 326 votes needed in parliament to avoid the government collapsing. But a deal with the DUP also risks destabilising Northern Ireland by increasing the influence of pro-British unionists. They have struggled for years with Irish nationalists, who want the British province to join a united Ireland. Former British Prime Minister John Major said he was concerned May's plan to govern with the support of the DUP could pitch the province back into turmoil by persuading 'hard men' on both sides of the divide to return to violence. Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein said the prospect of a British agreement with the DUP was causing anxiety and fear. While the DUP are deeply eurosceptic, they have balked at some of the practical implications of a so-called hard Brexit -- including a potential loss of a  frictionless border  with the Republic of Ireland -- and talks will touch on efforts to minimise the potential damage to Northern Ireland. Civil War Brexit minister David Davis has insisted the approach to the EU divorce has not changed, but May has recognised that a broader consensus needs to be built for Brexit and has made clear she would listen to all wings of the party on the issue. She will have to manage conflicting demands from within her own party, including a proposal for business groups and lawmakers from all parties to agree a national position for Britain's most complex negotiations since World War Two. Former Prime Minister David Cameron said May needed to listen to rival political parties, and that there would be pressure for a softer Brexit. May faces a difficult balancing act. Divisions over Europe helped sink the premierships of Margaret Thatcher, Major and Cameron, and many of her lawmakers and party membership support a sharp break with the EU. The performance of the British economy could also influence perceptions of Brexit. Government bond prices suffered heavy losses on Tuesday after consumer price inflation jumped to 2.9 percent in May. As European leaders tried to fathom exactly how Britain would begin the negotiations, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Germany wanted a Brexit deal that would limit negative consequences for the bloc but also did not want it to weaken Britain. The veteran conservative predicted that Britain would regret its departure from the bloc at some point in the future. France's Macron said the EU's door was still open for Britain as long as the negotiations were not finished, but that it would be difficult to reverse course.

Thousands of people could die in the coming months with up to 300,000 cases predicted, Save the Children said, adding that the infection rate had tripled in a fortnight.  Two years of civil war, near-famine conditions and a lack of access to clean water have exacerbated the spread of cholera - a diarrheal disease that can kill within hours. The country's health system - already on its knees - is reeling with hospitals overwhelmed and quickly running out of medicines and intravenous fluids.  The U.N. children's agency UNICEF said more than 920 people had died from the disease since late April and more than 124,000 cases had been recorded – almost half of them children.  Grant Pritchard, Save the Children's representative in Yemen, called for an increase in emergency funding to tackle the epidemic.  It's time for the world to take action before thousands of Yemeni boys and girls perish from an entirely preventable disease,  he said in a statement.  Disease, starvation and war are causing a perfect storm of disaster for Yemen's people. The region's poorest country is on the verge of total collapse, and children are dying because they're not able to access basic healthcare.  Yemen's civil war, pitting the Iran-allied Houthi group against a Western-backed Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia, has left 19 million people needing humanitarian aid with many on the verge of famine. More than 2 million children are acutely malnourished making them particularly vulnerable to cholera as their weakened systems are less able to fight off disease, Save the Children said. Pritchard said restrictions on bringing aid and medical supplies into Yemen, including delays accessing Hodeidah port and the closure of Sanaa airport, were compounding difficulties in halting the epidemic. Unaffordable transport is also making it hard for people to reach treatment. One man told the charity he had been forced to seek help for his children in the capital Sanaa, more than 200 km (125 miles) from his home, because his local hospital was full. The trip had cost 35,000 Yemen rial ($140). A nurse at a Sanaa cholera unit said there was one day when they had received more than 550 cases.  Every hour we receive patients. We work here 24 hours. People come from all governorates across the country,  the nurse added.  I have come across many sad stories.

My phone never stopped, I charged my phone three times, no kidding - overseas clients, overseas agents, my channels in China,  said Lin, who deals mostly with Chinese-based investors.  They definitely feel the pressure. They say, 'Shan, look, I will not consider investing in Australia or investing in Sydney'.  Chinese property investors are turning their backs on Australia as a series of measures designed to cool one of the world's hottest real estate markets targets foreign buyers, raising the risk of a damaging correction in house prices. Australia's latest move follows similar measures imposed in other favoured destinations for mainland Chinese including Vancouver, Singapore and Hong Kong. But there are fears the Australian measures have been introduced into a frothy market already showing signs of stress. Sutono Pratiknya, a Sydney-based sales consultant, said the changes sent a clear signal to his overseas investors they were not welcome.  We used to do five property tours a month, picking up a dozen investors from the airport and showing them our latest offering,  Pratiknya said.  Now, there's nothing.  With Australian banks heavily reliant on mortgages, economic growth slowing, and the Reserve Bank warning about households groaning under record amounts of debt, any sharp fall in house prices risks derailing Australia's record 26 year recession-free run. New South Wales' new tax arrangements will see duties from home sales to foreigners rising to 8 percent of the purchase price, taking total taxes on overseas buyers to more than 13 percent. Speed of Change While Australia is not alone in introducing foreign property taxes, the number and speed at which new policies are being imposed is spooking foreign buyers. In just over a year, all major east coast cities have introduced and, in the case of Sydney, expanded foreign duties; the country's biggest banks have stopped lending to overseas buyers; and the federal government has introduced punitive measures for foreigners who leave properties vacant. Foreigners will also lose a capital gains tax exemption for their primary residence in changes unveiled in last month's national budget. Big apartment developments are most at risk, given foreigners are restricted to buying  off-the-plan  and newly-built homes under Australian law. Foreigners account for a quarter of new housing sales in New South Wales, according to a Credit Suisse report, with Chinese investors by far the biggest buying group.  The fact is that a lot of developments hinge on foreign investment,  said David Bare, the NSW executive director at the Housing Industry Association.  Applying these measures when the market is starting to cool is going to have a much greater effect than it might've 12 or 18 months ago.  Sydney home prices, after doubling since 2009 to top A$872,000 ($658,000), recorded a rare fall in May, according to property consultant CoreLogic. Auction clearance rates - a key indicator of demand - have also been slipping as an abundance of new homes hit the market. Meriton Group, Australia's largest apartment developer, is expected to be impacted given it has a cluster of new Sydney developments targeting Chinese buyers.  Its connections into China are deep, but trying to sell to foreigners in this market is like swimming up a waterfall,  said one property investor close to the company who declined to be named. Janice Jiang, a Meriton sales consultant in Sydney, said the company made about half its sales to foreigners, and that the extra taxes would have little impact in the long run. Meriton's founder, billionaire Harry Triguboff, declined to comment on the impact of the tax hike. Bust or Robust? At development sites scattered throughout Sydney's tony northern suburbs and sprawling west, showrooms have signs in Mandarin and offer Asian sweets, in addition to coolers full of Australian wines, seeking to tempt both foreign and local buyers. At one showroom for a 38-apartment development called Emerald Epping, sales agent Henry Wong said most customers might appear Asian, but were often from families who migrated a generation or more ago. Some developers say such domestic sales are robust enough to fill any gap left by foreigners, especially given extra government help for first-time home buyers.  We are OK with this, our business model isn't relying on massive investment from overseas purchasers and for first home buyers, it's the right decision,  said Jay Carter, sales and marketing director at Poly Australia, a subsidiary of Chinese state-controlled Poly Real Estate Group Co. Art Yang, chairman of Gasheng Overseas Investment Group based in China's Guangzhou, said the new taxes would not impact very wealthy Chinese buyers, but would hurt investors borrowing to buy property. Many are being advised to look elsewhere.  It seems like the tax increases are never-ending,  said Esther Yong, a director of Chinese property agencies Sodichan and ACproperty.  I have buyers who were looking at Australian property and agents in China convinced them to buy in the U.K. instead.

The Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, which was implicated in the 2014 story, which was retracted, said it would donate a significant portion of the settlement proceeds to groups providing services to combat sexual assault on college campuses. No other terms of the agreement were provided in the fraternity's online announcement of the deal but a spokesman for Phi Kappa Psi, Brian Ellis, confirmed the sum to be paid in return for dismissal of the suit was $1.65 million. The original lawsuit sought $25 million in damages. Rolling Stone representatives declined comment except to say the settlement had just been reached and has not yet been entered in court. The fraternity's defamation claims against the magazine and the article's author, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, had been due to go to trial in October.  The settlement brings to an end the last of several lawsuits sparked by the  A Rape on Campus  article, which described the alleged sexual assault on a freshman woman during a fraternity party at the University of Virginia's Charlottesville campus in 2012. The article stoked a national debate about sexual assault on U.S. college campuses, where by some estimates one in five female students will become a victim before graduating, and fueled perceptions of fraternity culture as dangerously permissive and predatory. But the published story, based on the account of a female student identified only as  Jackie,  was ultimately discredited as the magazine admitted it never sought comment from the seven men accused of the alleged rape. The story was officially retracted in April 2015, and an outside review concluded that Rolling Stone failed to follow basic journalistic safeguards in its reporting. A separate defamation case brought against the magazine by university administrator Nicole Eramo was settled two months ago after a federal court jury awarded her $3 million in damages. Another lawsuit by three former fraternity members was dismissed by a federal judge in June 2016.

Erdogan's comments marked the strongest intervention yet by a powerful regional ally of Doha eight days after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar and applied stringent economic sanctions on it. Later on Tuesday, the UAE ambassador to the United States, which has an air base in Qatar, said there was no military component to the steps taken against Doha. Qatar denies accusations that it supports Islamist militants and Shi'ite Iran, arch regional foe of the Sunni Gulf Arab monarchies.  A very grave mistake is being made in Qatar; isolating a nation in all areas is inhumane and against Islamic values. It's as if a death penalty decision has been taken for Qatar,  Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party in Ankara.   Qatar has shown the most decisive stance against the terrorist organization Islamic State alongside Turkey. Victimizing Qatar through smear campaigns serves no purpose.  The measures against Qatar, a small oil and gas exporter with a population of 2.7 million people, have disrupted imports of food and other materials and caused some foreign banks to scale back business. The UAE envoy, Yousef Al Otaiba, told reporters in Washington:  There is absolutely no military component to anything that we are doing.   I have spoken and seen (U.S. Defense Secretary) General (Jim) Mattis four times in the last week; we’ve given them our complete assurance that the steps we have taken will not affect in anyway Al Udeid base or any operations supporting or regarding the base,  Otaiba said. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is home to more than 11,000 U.S. and coalition forces and an important base for the fight against Islamic State militants in the region.

The world's second largest helium producer, Qatar has also shut its two helium production plants because of the economic boycott, industry sources told Reuters on Tuesday. Turkey has maintained good relations with Qatar as well as several of its Gulf Arab neighbors. Turkey and Qatar have both provided support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and backed rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi also criticized the measures imposed on Qatar, saying in Baghdad on Tuesday they were hurting the emirate's people, not its rulers.

Yasin Bulbul/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERSSaudi Food Supplies? Gulf Arab states have issued no public demands to Qatar, but a list that has been circulating includes severing diplomatic ties with Iran, expulsion of all members of the Palestinian Hamas group and the Muslim Brotherhood, the freezing of all bank accounts of Hamas members, ending support for  terrorist organizations  and ending interference in Egyptian affairs. Some analysts say demands could also include closing down  satellite channel Al Jazeera, or changing its editorial policy. When asked what, if any, further steps would be taken against Qatar, the UAE's Otaiba said:  We’ve designated 59 people and 12 entities; it’s likely that you could see designations of their bank accounts, and perhaps of the banks themselves.   The specific list is being drawn up and the reason it has not been completed and passed on yet is because there’s four countries involved,  he added.  Each country has their own set of lists, their own specifications and so we’re trying to compile and curate that into one master list and it should be handed over to the United States fairly soon.  Slideshow (9 Images)Otaiba reiterated the accusations that Qatar was supporting terrorism.  Doha has become a financial, media and ideological hub for extremism. Then it must take decisive action to deal once and for all with its extremist problem,  he wrote in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal published on Monday night. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, talking to reporters during a news conference in Washington on Tuesday with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said Riyadh was ready to send food and medical supplies to Qatar. The minister, Adel al-Jubeir, defended the Arab powers' move against Qatar as a boycott, not a blockade, adding:  We have allowed the movement of families between the two countries ... so that we don’t divide families.  There has been no breakthrough in Kuwaiti efforts to mediate in the crisis, but a U.S. official in the region said Kuwait was continuing with what is seen as a  slow, painstaking, deliberate  process focused inside the Gulf Cooperation Council.  The parties are still defining what it is they want out of this confrontation ... It's difficult to conduct negotiations if you don't really know what everybody wants.  International Diplomacy Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdulrahman al-Thani said on Monday that Doha  still had no clue  why Arab states had cut ties. He denied Doha supported groups like the Muslim Brotherhood that its neighbors oppose, or had warm ties with their enemy Iran. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Erdogan would discuss the Gulf rift in a telephone call with U.S. President Donald Trump in coming days. Turkey approved plans last week to deploy more troops to a military base it has established in Qatar under a 2014 agreement with the Gulf Arab state. The move was seen as support by regional power and NATO member Turkey to Doha. In Moscow, the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia's King Salman discussed the crisis in a phone call on Tuesday. The Kremlin said the dispute was not helping to unite efforts to try to find a Syria settlement or fight terrorism.

Between 40 percent and 60 percent of over-75s in Europe and the United States take aspirin every day, previous studies have estimated, but the implications of long-term use in older people have remained unclear until now because most clinical trials involve patients under 75. The study published on Wednesday, however, was split equally between over-75s and younger patients, examining a total of 3,166 Britons who had suffered a heart attack or stroke and were taking blood-thinning medication to prevent a recurrence. Researchers emphasized that the findings did not mean that older patients should stop taking aspirin. Instead, they recommend broad use of proton pump inhibitor heartburn drugs such as omeprazole, which can cut the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding by 70-90 percent. While aspirin -- invented by Bayer in 1897 and now widely available over the counter -- is generally viewed as harmless, bleeding has long been a recognized hazard. Peter Rothwell, one of the study authors, said that taking anti-platelet drugs such as aspirin prevented a fifth of recurrent heart attacks and strokes but also led to about 3,000 excess-bleeding deaths annually in Britain alone. The majority of these were in people aged over 75.  In people under 75 the benefits of taking aspirin for secondary prevention after a heart attack or stroke clearly outweigh the relatively small risk of bleeding. These people needn't worry,  Rothwell said.  In the over-75s the risk of a serious bleed is higher, but the key point is that this risk is substantially preventable by taking proton pump inhibitors alongside aspirin.  Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine President Alan Boyd, who was not involved in the study, said it had been considered that the benefits of aspirin outweighed the risks of bleeding in all patients and that the new research would force a reappraisal. Rothwell, Director of the Centre for Prevention of Stroke and Dementia at Oxford University, and his colleagues found that the annual rate of life-threatening or fatal bleeds was less than 0.5 percent in under-65s, rising to 1.5 percent for those aged 75-84 and nearly 2.5 percent for over-85s. Because the majority of patients studied were taking low-dose aspirin, rather than more modern anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel or AstraZeneca's Brilinta, the study could not draw conclusions about combined drug use. However, a commentary in The Lancet medical journal, where the study was published, noted that patients on dual anti-platelet therapy were known to have a higher risk of bleeding than those on monotherapy and that the research showed the need for regular evaluation of older patients.

Capitol Hill sources who asked not to be named said Trump described the version of the legislation that passed the House last month as  mean.  That House bill was widely criticized for letting states seek waivers from insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump discussed the healthcare bill at a White House lunch he hosted for Republican senators in a bid to help the lawmakers find common ground to move forward with healthcare reform legislation this summer. The White House declined to comment on private conversations between Trump and lawmakers. During the portion of the lunch open to reporters, Trump told the lawmakers their healthcare bill would need to be  generous  and  kind.   That may be adding additional money into it,  he said, without offering details on how much money might be needed or how it might be used. Related CoverageTrump says healthcare reform push may need additional moneyTrump stepped up pressure for the repeal with a tweet Tuesday morning declaring that the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare,  is in a death spiral.  He cited the government's announcement Monday that some 2 million people who signed up for Obamacare have dropped out this year.  Although Trump's Republican Party has a majority in both houses of Congress, Trump blamed  obstructionist  Democrats for the lack of progress in repealing President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement. Senator John Thune, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, who attended the lunch meeting, said Trump was open to suggestions that some federal cost-sharing payments to health insurers under Obamacare continue in the near term but that the president did not make any definite pronouncements on that issue.

Trump has said he might consider withholding them but insurers say that would wreak havoc in the markets. Thune also said Trump did not give any deadlines to the senators on passing the bill.  I hope that we can stay on schedule to have floor action before the Fourth of July break,  Thune said.       Slideshow (3 Images)The House of Representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month but Senate Republicans have been unable to coalesce around their own version of a bill, with moderates and conservatives pushing in different directions in meetings behind closed doors. The senators Trump invited to lunch included Republicans from both ideological camps. Moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were on the list as well as conservatives Ted Cruz and Mike Lee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said senators are closer to bringing up a proposal and other Republicans have predicted for some time that a bill would be ready for a vote before the August recess. Senate aides said the Senate bill was not expected to touch insurance protections that are included in Obamacare for people with pre-existing medical conditions, after the controversy over the House bill that would let states seek waivers from those protections. In states with such waivers, people with pre-existing conditions could still get coverage but they would not be shielded against potentially higher costs. Another senator at the lunch, Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, said after the meeting that there still was a lot of work to do before legislation can be unveiled.   The total bill hasn't been resolved,  he said.

The joint warning from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said that  cyber actors of the North Korean government,  referred to in the report as  Hidden Cobra,  had targeted the media, aerospace and financial sectors, as well as critical infrastructure, in the United States and globally. The new level of detail about the U.S. government's analysis of suspected North Korean hacking activity coincides with increasing tensions between Washington and Pyongyang because of  North Korea's missile tests. The alert warned that North Korea would continue to rely on cyber operations to advance its military and strategic objectives. North Korea has routinely denied involvement in cyber attacks against other countries. The North Korean mission to the United Nations was not immediately available for comment.  Tuesday's alert said Hidden Cobra has been previously referred to by private sector experts as Lazarus Group and Guardians of the Peace, which have been linked to attacks such as the 2014 intrusion into Sony Corp's (6758.T) Sony Pictures Entertainment. Symantec Corp (SYMC.O) and Kaspersky Lab both said last month it was  highly likely  that Lazarus was behind the WannaCry ransomware attack that infected more than 300,000 computers worldwide, disrupting operations at hospitals, banks and schools. The alert did not identify specific Hidden Cobra victims. It said the group had compromised a range of victims and that some intrusions had resulted in thefts of data while others were disruptive. The group's capabilities include denial of service attacks, which send reams of junk traffic to a server to knock it offline, keystroke logging, remote access tools and several variants of malware, the alert said. John Hultquist, a cyber intelligence analyst with FireEye Inc (FEYE.O), said that his firm was concerned about increasingly aggressive cyber attacks from North Korea. The North Korea flag flutters next to concertina wire at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia March 9, 2017.Edgar SuThe hacks include cyber espionage at South Korean finance, energy and transportation firms that appears to be reconnaissance ahead of other attacks that would be disruptive or destructive, he said.   It suggests they are preparing for something fairly significant,  he added.     Hidden Cobra commonly targets systems that run older versions of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) operating systems that are no longer patched, the alert said, and also used vulnerabilities in Adobe Systems Inc's (ADBE.O) Flash software to gain access into targeted computers. The report urged organizations to upgrade to current versions of Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight or, when possible, uninstall those applications altogether.  Microsoft said it an emailed statement that it had  addressed  the Silverlight issue in a January 2016 software update. Adobe said via email that it patched the vulnerabilities in June 2016. North Korean hacking activity has grown increasingly hostile in recent years, according to Western officials and cyber security experts. The alert arrived on the same day that North Korea released an American university student who had been held captive by Pyongyang for 17 months.  Otto Warmbier, 22, was on his way back to the United States on Tuesday but in a coma and in urgent need of medical care, according to Bill Richardson, a veteran former diplomat and politician who has played a role in past negotiations with North Korea.  The U.S. government seeks to arm network defenders with the tools they need to identify, detect and disrupt North Korean government malicious cyber activity that is targeting our country's and our allies’ networks,  a DHS official said about the alert. The official was not authorized to speak publicly.

Between 40 percent and 60 percent of over-75s in Europe and the United States take aspirin every day, previous studies have estimated, but the implications of long-term use in older people have remained unclear until now because most clinical trials involve patients under 75. The study published on Wednesday, however, was split equally between over-75s and younger patients, examining a total of 3,166 Britons who had suffered a heart attack or stroke and were taking blood-thinning medication to prevent a recurrence. Researchers emphasized that the findings did not mean that older patients should stop taking aspirin. Instead, they recommend broad use of proton pump inhibitor heartburn drugs such as omeprazole, which can cut the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding by 70-90 percent. While aspirin -- invented by Bayer in 1897 and now widely available over the counter -- is generally viewed as harmless, bleeding has long been a recognized hazard. Peter Rothwell, one of the study authors, said that taking anti-platelet drugs such as aspirin prevented a fifth of recurrent heart attacks and strokes but also led to about 3,000 excess-bleeding deaths annually in Britain alone. The majority of these were in people aged over 75.  In people under 75 the benefits of taking aspirin for secondary prevention after a heart attack or stroke clearly outweigh the relatively small risk of bleeding. These people needn't worry,  Rothwell said.  In the over-75s the risk of a serious bleed is higher, but the key point is that this risk is substantially preventable by taking proton pump inhibitors alongside aspirin.  Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine President Alan Boyd, who was not involved in the study, said it had been considered that the benefits of aspirin outweighed the risks of bleeding in all patients and that the new research would force a reappraisal. Rothwell, Director of the Centre for Prevention of Stroke and Dementia at Oxford University, and his colleagues found that the annual rate of life-threatening or fatal bleeds was less than 0.5 percent in under-65s, rising to 1.5 percent for those aged 75-84 and nearly 2.5 percent for over-85s. Because the majority of patients studied were taking low-dose aspirin, rather than more modern anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel or AstraZeneca's Brilinta, the study could not draw conclusions about combined drug use. However, a commentary in The Lancet medical journal, where the study was published, noted that patients on dual anti-platelet therapy were known to have a higher risk of bleeding than those on monotherapy and that the research showed the need for regular evaluation of older patients.

David Lapan, a DHS spokesman, said in a briefing Tuesday that he would not disclose specific security enhancements but said they were  in the way of information sharing, passenger information, detection types of steps.  Homeland Security chief John Kelly told a congressional panel last week he was looking at an additional 71 airports in Europe, Africa and the Middle East for a possible expansion of the ban.  A European airline industry official told Reuters the United States had suggested possible enhancements including explosive trace detection screening, increased vetting of airports' staff and additional detection dogs.   U.S. restrictions on laptops announced in March, including on flights originating from airports in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, came amid fears a concealed bomb could be installed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. Britain followed suit with restrictions. Any expansion of the ban could impact U.S. carriers such as United Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group. Lapan said the United States would not present a definitive list to Europeans to avoid a ban but rather options under consideration. He added that it  remains to be seen  if enhanced security measure could allow reversal of existing airports under the ban.         DHS officials are attending the meeting in Malta  to present what we think are the minimum increased security standards ... and present those to people to say if you meet these standards we will not ban large electronics,  Kelly said.  Reuters and other media outlets reported in early May that an expansion was likely, but more than a month later, the U.S. government has offered no timetable for making a decision. Lapan said no decision was expected this week.

After losing her parliamentary majority in a botched gamble on a snap election, May is so weakened that her Brexit strategy has become the subject of public debate inside her own party, with calls for her to take a more business-friendly approach. Seeking to avoid a second election that could deepen Britain's worst political turmoil since last June's shock vote to leave the EU, May edged closer to a deal to win the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). She held talks with DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose eurosceptic Northern Irish party has 10 parliamentary seats and could shore up May's minority Conservative government.  What we're doing in relation to the talks that we're holding, the productive talks we're holding with the Democratic Unionist Party, is ensuring that it is possible to, with their support, give the stability to the UK government that I think is necessary at this time,  May told a news conference in Paris following a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. Earlier, Foster said the talks were going well:  We hope soon to be able to bring this work to a successful conclusion.  May made clear the Brexit negotiations would begin on schedule despite the political uncertainty at home.  I confirmed to President Macron that the timetable for the Brexit negotiation remains on course and will begin next week,  May said after her meeting with the new French leader, who will be a key player in the Brexit talks.   I think there is a unity of purpose among people in the United Kingdom. It's a unity of purpose, having voted to leave the EU, that their government gets on with that and makes a success of it.  During the election campaign, May cast herself as the only leader competent to navigate the tortuous Brexit negotiations that will shape the future of the United Kingdom and its $2.5 trillion economy. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, which saw its number of parliamentary seats and share of the vote increase, said there could be another election this year or early in 2018 after last Thursday's vote produced no clear winner. Destabilizing Risk Related CoverageBritain's Hammond to push for UK to stay in EU customs union: The Times'Anxiety and fear' in Northern Ireland over Conservative-DUP talks: Sinn FeinUK ex-PM David Cameron says May should consult rivals on Brexit: FTThe BBC reported that a deal with the DUP was expected to be signed on Wednesday. That would give May enough votes to pass her legislative agenda through parliament and govern, albeit with a wafer-thin majority. But a deal with the DUP also risks destabilizing Northern Ireland by increasing the influence of pro-British unionists. They have struggled for years with Irish Catholic nationalists, who want the British province to join a united Ireland. Former British prime minister John Major said he was concerned May's plan to govern with the support of the DUP could pitch the province back into turmoil by persuading 'hard men' on both sides of the divide to return to violence.  The last thing anybody wishes to see is one or other of the communities so aggrieved that the hard men, who are still there lurking in the corners of the communities, decide that they wish to return to some form of violence,  Major told BBC radio.  I am concerned about the deal. I am wary about it. I am dubious about it,  Major said. Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein said the prospect of a British agreement with the DUP was causing anxiety and fear.  Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May, leaves 10 Downing Street in central London, Britain June 13, 2017.Phil NobleWhile the DUP are deeply eurosceptic, they have balked at some of the practical implications of a so-called hard Brexit -- including a potential loss of a  frictionless border  with the Republic of Ireland -- and talks will touch on efforts to minimize the potential damage to Northern Ireland. Brexit Civil War? May, who ahead of last June's referendum supported remaining in the EU, promised to start the Brexit talks next week, but opponents of a sharp break with the EU took her woes as a chance to push back against her strategy. Before the election, May proposed a clean break from the EU, involving withdrawal from Europe's single market, limits on immigration and a bespoke customs deal with the EU. Brexit minister David Davis has insisted the approach to the EU divorce has not changed, but at the meeting with lawmakers on Monday, May recognized that a broader consensus needed to be built for Brexit and made clear she would listen to all wings of the party on the issue. She will have to manage conflicting demands from within her own party, including a proposal for business groups and lawmakers from all parties to agree a national position for Britain's most complex negotiations since World War Two.  Slideshow (4 Images)May faces a difficult balancing act: Divisions over Europe helped sink the premierships of Margaret Thatcher, Major and David Cameron, and many of her lawmakers and party membership support a sharp break with the EU.    The Tory civil war on the EU which has ripped it apart since the Maastricht rebellions of the early 1990s, and which the referendum was supposed to solve, is now raging again,  said Chris Grey, an academic who specializes in Brexit at Royal Holloway college in London.  Good Clean Brexit  Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the government should put economic growth at the heart of its Brexit  strategy, comments placing her in the camp of those advocating a closer trade relationship with the EU, or  soft  Brexit. May appointed Steve Baker, a prominent Brexit campaigner, to the Department for Exiting the EU.  We need a good, clean exit which minimizes disruption and maximizes opportunity,  Baker said just hours before his appointment.  The performance of the British economy could also influence perceptions of Brexit. Government bond prices were on track for their heaviest one-day losses since January after consumer price inflation jumped to 2.9 percent in May. As European leaders tried to fathom exactly how Britain would begin the negotiations, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he wanted a Brexit deal that would limit negative consequences for the bloc but nor did it want to weaken Britain.  We want a solution that causes as little damage as possible for both sides,  Schaeuble said, adding that he expected London to remain an important financial center for Europe. The veteran conservative predicted that Britain would regret its departure from the bloc at some point in the future.   And then they'll come back. But it remains another question if I'll still witness this,  added the 74-year-old. Asked about Schaeuble's comments, Macron said the EU's door was still open for Britain as long as the negotiations were not finished, but that it would be difficult to reverse course.

The development is the latest in a feud between leaders in the Republican-controlled legislature and Democratic Governor Mark Dayton that has escalated since last month.  The lawsuit, filed in the Ramsey County Court, claims Dayton has hobbled the ability of lawmakers to work by vetoing nearly $130 million in funding last month for the House and Senate's compensation, benefits and other operating expenses for the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years. The governor's office declined to comment on the lawsuit.  Without the funding, the legislature is  unable to fulfill their constitutional obligations, will not be able to properly represent their constituents, and the people of the state of Minnesota are deprived of a constitutionally mandated voice in the administration of their government,  the complaint said. Legislative funding covers paychecks for the 201 elected officials as well as about 400 staff and other bills, according to a report from the House's public information system.  The lawsuit is seeking for the funding to be reinstated before July 1, when the new fiscal year begins, court documents said.  Dayton's decision to veto the legislature funding stems from a move earlier this year in which Republican lawmakers linked a package of tax breaks to funding for the state's 1,300 Department of Revenue employees in order to force Dayton to allow the tax package to become law. Dayton vetoed the legislature funding on May 30 to force lawmakers back to the negotiating table on several other tax measures, including a tobacco tax and estate tax, he said.     Before the lawsuit was filed, Dayton met with Republican Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka and Republican Speaker Kurt Daudt on Tuesday morning, but Dayton said there was no movement and no compromise between the two parties.

The business, which accounted for nearly a third of the company's total revenue in 2016, will be divided into seven units, instead of the present five. All will report to BDS Chief Executive Leanne Caret. The executives to be cut represent a layer of middle management in between senior officials and each individual business unit.  Caret told Reuters the restructuring will make the business faster and help Boeing better anticipate the needs of defense customers.  Customers have  a desire to move fast, and we need to be part of the solution,  she said.  Boeing's defense arm sells a variety of military equipment including jet fighters, missiles and unmanned underwater vehicles to the United States and its allies. Boeing's military aircraft business, part of the BDS unit, will be rearranged into three smaller segments: autonomous systems, strike surveillance and mobility, and vertical lift. Autonomous systems, led by Chris Raymond, will comprise  Boeing's subsidiaries Liquid Robotics, which makes the Wave Glider ocean surface robot, and Insitu unmanned aerial vehicles, among other businesses. The strike surveillance and mobility business, led by Shelley Lavender, will include the F-15 and F/A-18 fighters and P-8 maritime patrol aircraft.

The business, which accounted for nearly a third of the company's total revenue in 2016, will be divided into seven units, instead of the present five. All will report to BDS Chief Executive Leanne Caret. The executives to be cut represent a layer of middle management in between senior officials and each individual business unit.  Caret told Reuters the restructuring will make the business faster and help Boeing better anticipate the needs of defense customers.  Customers have  a desire to move fast, and we need to be part of the solution,  she said.  Boeing's defense arm sells a variety of military equipment including jet fighters, missiles and unmanned underwater vehicles to the United States and its allies. Boeing's military aircraft business, part of the BDS unit, will be rearranged into three smaller segments: autonomous systems, strike surveillance and mobility, and vertical lift. Autonomous systems, led by Chris Raymond, will comprise  Boeing's subsidiaries Liquid Robotics, which makes the Wave Glider ocean surface robot, and Insitu unmanned aerial vehicles, among other businesses. The strike surveillance and mobility business, led by Shelley Lavender, will include the F-15 and F/A-18 fighters and P-8 maritime patrol aircraft. Boeing's AH-6i, AH-64 Apache, and CH-47 Chinook helicopters will become part of the new vertical lift segment, led by David Koopersmith.

But Trump is months away from installing top officials at key regulatory posts to carry out his agenda.  We won't see policy changes before the end of the year,  said Rich Foster, senior counsel for regulatory and legal affairs at the Financial Services Roundtable, a trade group. Trump has gradually been nominating heads of financial agencies, but only Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton have been approved by Congress. Other agencies are either awaiting presidential picks or are operating under  acting  chiefs. Others have leaders appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama. The Federal Reserve has already signaled it will make its stress testing of banks more transparent and is considering other steps to simplify the process, in line with Treasury's recommendations. But the Treasury called for even more significant changes, including having the Fed overhaul its testing models and assumptions. Such changes may have to wait until the administration has appointed a vice chair in charge of banking oversight at the Fed. Randal Quarles, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration, is expected to be Trump's pick for the Fed's top bank regulator, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. He has not been named publicly while he is being vetted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Government Ethics.     Once he is named, he will have to be confirmed by the Senate -- a process that could easily slide into the fall with Congress facing a busy calendar and an upcoming five-week congressional recess from the end of July to the beginning of September. Analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank, has found that since 1989, it has taken an average of 149 days for a financial regulatory nominee to receive Senate confirmation after being announced.     Quarles has declined to comment on speculation about the possible nomination.  Meanwhile, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is being managed by an interim Trump pick, Keith Noreika, while the Senate considers Joseph Otting for the top role. Otting was nominated earlier this month, but could face a contentious confirmation. Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee that will consider the pick, has already announced his opposition, citing his time as an executive at OneWest Bank and that firm's foreclosure practices. In addition to Clayton at the SEC, Christopher Giancarlo, the acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is already in position, awaiting full confirmation to take on the role full-time. But at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Obama appointee Martin Gruenberg intends to serve his full term, which expires in November. Treasury's plans to ease some of the restrictions around banks' trading, living wills and their adherence to international banking accords could face resistance from him, given his role in drafting many existing rules. An FDIC spokesperson declined to comment.     The Treasury report also focuses significant attention on overhauling mortgage rules. But that would require cooperation from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which wrote many of them. That agency's Obama-appointed director, Richard Cordray, has a term that does not expire until summer 2018. The CFPB, created in the wake of the financial crisis, receives its funding through the Federal Reserve and Trump can only fire Cordray  for cause,  an almost impossible standard to meet. That leaves few levers the administration can pull to get the agency to reorganize its internal operations or make the suggested changes on mortgages.      Cordray will probably do nothing more than subject Trump's proposals to  long-term analysis,  said Quyen Truong, a partner at law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, which in Washington means he will shelve it. Truong was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the CFPB until early 2016.      The changes proposed by the study go to fundamental aspects of the CFPB's philosophy and operations,  she said.  The CFPB likely will not confront directly those proposals.  A CFPB spokesperson said the agency was reviewing the report, but had no further comment at this time.  A Treasury spokesperson maintained the administration would be working quickly on its recommendations even as some key posts await Trump picks.  We have strong working relationships with the regulators and considerable dialogue is already underway,  said a Treasury spokesperson.  We plan on working with them to begin swiftly advancing these recommendations.

Capitol Hill sources who asked not to be named said Trump described the version of the legislation that passed the House last month as  mean.  That House bill was widely criticized for letting states seek waivers from insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump discussed the healthcare bill at a White House lunch he hosted for Republican senators in a bid to help the lawmakers find common ground to move forward with healthcare reform legislation this summer. The White House declined to comment on private conversations between Trump and lawmakers. During the portion of the lunch open to reporters, Trump told the lawmakers their healthcare bill would need to be  generous  and  kind.   That may be adding additional money into it,  he said, without offering details on how much money might be needed or how it might be used. Related CoverageTrump says healthcare reform push may need additional moneyTrump stepped up pressure for the repeal with a tweet Tuesday morning declaring that the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare,  is in a death spiral.  He cited the government's announcement Monday that some 2 million people who signed up for Obamacare have dropped out this year.  Although Trump's Republican Party has a majority in both houses of Congress, Trump blamed  obstructionist  Democrats for the lack of progress in repealing President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement. Senator John Thune, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, who attended the lunch meeting, said Trump was open to suggestions that some federal cost-sharing payments to health insurers under Obamacare continue in the near term but that the president did not make any definite pronouncements on that issue. U.S. President Donald Trump attends a lunch meeting with members of Congress at the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 13, 2017.Carlos BarriaThose payments help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans. Trump has said he might consider withholding them but insurers say that would wreak havoc in the markets. Thune also said Trump did not give any deadlines to the senators on passing the bill.  I hope that we can stay on schedule to have floor action before the Fourth of July break,  Thune said.       Slideshow (3 Images)The House of Representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month but Senate Republicans have been unable to coalesce around their own version of a bill, with moderates and conservatives pushing in different directions in meetings behind closed doors. The senators Trump invited to lunch included Republicans from both ideological camps. Moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were on the list as well as conservatives Ted Cruz and Mike Lee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said senators are closer to bringing up a proposal and other Republicans have predicted for some time that a bill would be ready for a vote before the August recess. Senate aides said the Senate bill was not expected to touch insurance protections that are included in Obamacare for people with pre-existing medical conditions, after the controversy over the House bill that would let states seek waivers from those protections. In states with such waivers, people with pre-existing conditions could still get coverage but they would not be shielded against potentially higher costs. Another senator at the lunch, Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, said after the meeting that there still was a lot of work to do before legislation can be unveiled.   The total bill hasn't been resolved,  he said.

So determined was Stricker to play in the first U.S. Open to be played in his home state that he hit the practice grounds and then earned his spot in the year's second major by firing rounds of 67-65 during a qualifying event last week in Memphis.  Very exciting to be here,  local golf hero Stricker told reporters on Tuesday.  I wasn't sure if I was going to be here, but very excited, relieved. Worked hard to get here.  Put a lot of extra effort in playing some extra tournaments. So all in all, it worked out for me to be here.  The 50-year-old Stricker, a 12-times winner on the PGA Tour who ranked as high as second in the world rankings, has pared down his tournament golf in recent seasons and played just eight events on the PGA Tour this season. The U.S. Golf Association respectfully declined Stricker's application for an exemption even though he is certain to be a crowd favourite playing in an event about an hour's drive from his home.  I had more and more people come up to me and say, 'Hey why aren't you in?' and pretty soon it became a little chip on my shoulder that I had to work a little bit harder to try to get in,  said Stricker, whose wife will caddie for him. Stricker said his hard-working path to the U.S. Open, where he will seek his maiden major title, reflects the values of Wisconsin people in general and that he is happy about earning his place rather than having it handed to him. And while he is hardly among the top contenders this week Stricker, who finished fourth at last year's British Open, said he is not letting that change his approach.  I go into every tournament expecting to play well, and this is really no different,  said Stricker, who will serve as the U.S. captain at this year's Presidents Cup starting on September 28 in New Jersey.  I'm going in trying to compete the best that I can and hopefully get in contention. That's my goal.

Wall Street gained on Tuesday, with the S&P; 500, Dow industrials and Russell 2000 setting record closing highs, as technology stocks bounced back and investors positioned ahead of an expected Federal Reserve interest rate hike. Against that backdrop of soaring stock markets, the CBOE Volatility Index, also known as the VIX Index or the  fear gauge  for U.S. stocks, has been dropping.   Friday, the index plunged to 9.37, its lowest since Dec. 27, 1993.  We're on increasing watch for volatility,  Gundlach said, pointing out that  there is a massive amount of money that is being short VIX.  It's a trade that's made a lot of money and it's very very crowded, which suggests to me the days of low volatility are numbered,  he said. We  probably won't see it continue through year end.   Gundlach, who runs more than $105 billion at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital, said investors should rotate out of U.S. stocks and into European equities, and also avoid U.S. Treasuries as he sees rates moving higher during the second half of the year.  I strongly urge investors to peel a portion of their S&P; holdings and move into Europe,  Gundlach said.  Gundlach said he expects the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which stood around 2.21 percent on Tuesday, to move higher during the latter half of 2017. However, he does not expect it to hit 3 percent. Gundlach said the relative value between U.S. Treasuries and lower-yielding overseas government bonds are keeping U.S. yields in a tight range.  All told, short-term investors should brace for a rocky summer, Gundlach said.   If you're a trader or a speculator, I think you should be raising cash today literally today. If you're an investor you can easily sit through a seasonally weak period,  Gundlach said.

The Journal said the talks between Hexagon and the potential buyers were at an early stage and that the company may ultimately decide not to pursue a sale.  Hexagon has a current market value of around 130 billion Swedish crowns ($15 billion), and had sales of 3.1 billion euros ($3.47 billion) in 2016. It is aiming for sales of 4.6-5.1 billion euros by 2021. The company was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. According to the Journal, two factors were pushing Hexagon to consider a deal: an insider trading case against Chief Executive Ola Rollen and the bad health of Melker Schorling, whose firm is Hexagon's main shareholder and who recently stepped down as Hexagon chairman. Rollen's trial for insider trading in Norway, which relates to an investment that did not involve Hexagon, is expected to start in late October. Rollen denies wrongdoing.  With Rollen at the helm, Hexagon has transformed from a sprawling conglomerate with a market value of a few billion crowns in 2000 into a 130 billion-crown global measurement technology market leader following a steady stream of acquisitions and high growth.

The prosecutor's office said the Real Madrid forward had knowingly used a business structure created in 2010 to allegedly hide his image rights income in Spain between 2011 and 2014. This involved a  voluntary  failure to comply with his tax obligations in Spain, the statement from the office's economic crimes section said. The four counts of tax fraud were based on a report from Spain's tax agency, it said in a statement. Ronaldo denied the accusations through his representatives late on Tuesday.  There is no tax evasion scheme ... There has never been any hiding nor any intention to hide anything,  Gestifute, the agency representing the player, said in a statement. Gestifute said it would publish documents to show the Portuguese player had not created such a structure and had instead used firms he had owned since his time at Manchester United that both British and Spanish tax authorities had been aware of. The agency also said the case could relate to different interpretations between the British and Spanish tax systems over where to declare some revenues but would in any case not constitute fraud. Ronaldo, who led Real Madrid to their 12th European Cup earlier this month, is the latest in a long line of soccer players in Spain - among them Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Neymar - to be caught up in cases over tax or transfers. Between 2005 and 2010, foreign players in Spain were protected under the so-called  Beckham law  allowing them to curb their taxes. But as the financial crisis bit deeper, that exemption was lifted, paving the way for the cases.     Football Soccer - Latvia vs Portugal - 2018 World Cup Qualifying European Zone - Group B - Skonto Stadium, Riga, Latvia - June 9, 2017   Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo gestures   Reuters / Kacper PempelThe prosecutor's office alleges that Ronaldo had defrauded the tax authorities of 1.4 million euros in 2011, 1.7 million euros in 2012, 3.2 million euros in 2013 and 8.5 million euros in 2014. Image Rights The prosecutor said that after Ronaldo signed a contract to join Real Madrid in December 2008 he ceded his image rights to a company called Tollin Associates Ltd, domiciled in the British Virgin Islands and in which he was the only stakeholder. Tollin Associates then ceded his image rights to a company in Ireland called Multisports&Image; Management Ltd which was responsible for managing them. Tollin Associates itself had no business activity, the statement said.  Ceding image rights to (Tollin Associates) was completely unnecessary and its only purpose was to create a screen to conceal the totality of his image rights income from the Spanish tax authorities,  the statement said. The prosecutor's office filed the lawsuit against Ronaldo on Tuesday to a court in the Madrid district of Pozuelo de Alarcon. Ronaldo finished the soccer season scoring two goals in a 4-1 victory over Juventus in the Champions League final to become the tournament's top scorer with a total of 12 goals.  In May, Spain's Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Messi and stood by a Catalan regional court's 21-month prison sentence for defrauding authorities of 4.1 million euros on image rights. He is unlikely to go to prison as under Spanish law sentences under two years can be served under probation. Spain's High Court last month cleared Neymar of fraud but he still faces a corruption trial in Spain in connection with the value of his 2013 transfer from Santos to Barcelona.

When Theresa May met Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Tuesday, their political fortunes could hardly have been more different and neither could their outlooks. The French president is an ardent supporter of the European Union as the best defense against inequalities wrought by globalisation. The British prime minister wants to leave the bloc in  the national interest . While the two briefly raised Brexit - Macron said the door was open for Britain to change its mind and May said she was sticking to her time line - they were more interested in highlighting their common fight against terrorism. Before heading for a dinner of duck liver pate and monkfish and a friendly soccer match between England and France, the two said they would work together to find new ways to encourage firms to clamp down on internet hate speech.  We are launching a joint UK-French campaign to ensure that the internet cannot be used as a safe space for terrorists and criminals, and that it cannot be used to host the radicalising material that leads to so much harm,  May told a joint news conference on the grounds of France's Elysee Palace.  Crucially, our campaign will also include exploring creating a legal liability for tech companies if they fail to take the necessary action to remove unacceptable content.  After two Islamist militant attacks in Britain in less than two weeks, May's bid to clamp down on internet extremism has struck a chord with international leaders, especially Macron, whose country has suffered several jihadist attacks since 2015. To honor the victims of the attacks on London and Manchester that killed 30, the French Republican Guard before the soccer match played the Manchester rock anthem  Don't look back in anger  before a one-minute silence at the Stade de France, where a suicide bomber blew himself up in 2015.  We have decided to go further on a concrete plan to reinforce the obligation of social media companies to remove content that promotes hate and terrorism online.

David Lapan, a DHS spokesman, said in a briefing Tuesday that he would not disclose specific security enhancements but said they were  in the way of information sharing, passenger information, detection types of steps.  Homeland Security chief John Kelly told a congressional panel last week he was looking at an additional 71 airports in Europe, Africa and the Middle East for a possible expansion of the ban.  A European airline industry official told Reuters the United States had suggested possible enhancements including explosive trace detection screening, increased vetting of airports' staff and additional detection dogs.   U.S. restrictions on laptops announced in March, including on flights originating from airports in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, came amid fears a concealed bomb could be installed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. Britain followed suit with restrictions. Any expansion of the ban could impact U.S. carriers such as United Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group. Lapan said the United States would not present a definitive list to Europeans to avoid a ban but rather options under consideration. He added that it  remains to be seen  if enhanced security measure could allow reversal of existing airports under the ban.         DHS officials are attending the meeting in Malta  to present what we think are the minimum increased security standards ... and present those to people to say if you meet these standards we will not ban large electronics,  Kelly said.  Reuters and other media outlets reported in early May that an expansion was likely, but more than a month later, the U.S. government has offered no timetable for making a decision. Lapan said no decision was expected this week.

The United States Golf Association (USGA) pulls no punches when it chooses a venue and sets up the course and this year have chosen Erin Hills, a links style layout that weighs in at a beefy 7,800 yards. Winged Foot, the Olympic Club and Oakland Hills are just a few of the courses that over the years have brought golf's best to their knees and now Erin Hills will try to add its name to that list of heavyweight layouts. One round of golf at a U.S. Open can be like going 18 rounds in the ring, both capable of leaving the unprepared bruised and battered. Traditionally U.S. Open courses challenge golfers both mentally and physically with a combination of lightning fast greens, narrow fairways and gnarly rough.  Just a mental test, just dealing with the mental side of the game more than any other tournament,  said American Jordan Spieth, winner of the 2015 U.S. Open on a similar links style course at Chambers Bay.  It's always a physical test.   It's a big golf course. It's a tough one to walk ... the rough is always thick. You're just putting more effort into each round.   It (U.S. Open) certainly tests the mental game more than any other place in golf.  If you came for a stress free tournament you didn't come to the right place.  Over time some U.S. Open layouts such as Oakmont (nine times hosting), Baltusrol (seven) and Winged Foot (five) have developed frightening reputations. Jack Nicklaus, an 18-times major winner and noted course designer, rated Winged Foot a 12 on a scale of 1-to-10 in terms of difficulty. At the 1974 U.S. Open it proved so brutal that Hale Irwin won with a seven-over-par score inspiring a book entitled  Massacre at Winged Foot . The legendary Ben Hogan won the 1951 U.S. Open at Oakland Hills but called it a  monster  and the hardest course he ever played, not a single player breaking par in the opening three rounds. Just 11-years old, Erin Hills has no such bona fides but some including reigning British Open champion Henrik Stenson are wary of the dangers that lurk.  As always, the USGA likes to trick it up a little bit at times and if you go off track, then you're going to notice that that's not the place to be in a lot of areas, said the Swede.  It (U.S. Open) is one of the toughest mental tests that you're going to encounter out there, and it's important to be fresh.

Wall Street gained on Tuesday, with the S&P; 500, Dow industrials and Russell 2000 setting record closing highs, as technology stocks bounced back and investors positioned ahead of an expected Federal Reserve interest rate hike. Against that backdrop of soaring stock markets, the CBOE Volatility Index, also known as the VIX Index or the  fear gauge  for U.S. stocks, has been dropping.   Friday, the index plunged to 9.37, its lowest since Dec. 27, 1993.  We're on increasing watch for volatility,  Gundlach said, pointing out that  there is a massive amount of money that is being short VIX.  It's a trade that's made a lot of money and it's very very crowded, which suggests to me the days of low volatility are numbered,  he said. We  probably won't see it continue through year end.   Gundlach, who runs more than $105 billion at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital, said investors should rotate out of U.S. stocks and into European equities, and also avoid U.S. Treasuries as he sees rates moving higher during the second half of the year.  I strongly urge investors to peel a portion of their S&P; holdings and move into Europe,  Gundlach said.  Gundlach said he expects the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which stood around 2.21 percent on Tuesday, to move higher during the latter half of 2017. However, he does not expect it to hit 3 percent. Gundlach said the relative value between U.S. Treasuries and lower-yielding overseas government bonds are keeping U.S. yields in a tight range.  All told, short-term investors should brace for a rocky summer, Gundlach said.   If you're a trader or a speculator, I think you should be raising cash today literally today. If you're an investor you can easily sit through a seasonally weak period,  Gundlach said.

The Journal said the talks between Hexagon and the potential buyers were at an early stage and that the company may ultimately decide not to pursue a sale.  Hexagon has a current market value of around 130 billion Swedish crowns ($15 billion), and had sales of 3.1 billion euros ($3.47 billion) in 2016. It is aiming for sales of 4.6-5.1 billion euros by 2021. The company was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. According to the Journal, two factors were pushing Hexagon to consider a deal: an insider trading case against Chief Executive Ola Rollen and the bad health of Melker Schorling, whose firm is Hexagon's main shareholder and who recently stepped down as Hexagon chairman. Rollen's trial for insider trading in Norway, which relates to an investment that did not involve Hexagon, is expected to start in late October. Rollen denies wrongdoing.  With Rollen at the helm, Hexagon has transformed from a sprawling conglomerate with a market value of a few billion crowns in 2000 into a 130 billion-crown global measurement technology market leader following a steady stream of acquisitions and high growth.    In February the company made its biggest deal since 2010 by  acquiring U.S.-based MSC Software in a $834 million deal to boost its product portfolio in automated manufacturing.

The move likely delays any high court action on the administration's two emergency applications asking for the ban issued on March 6 to immediately go into effect. The March ban was Trump's second effort to impose travel restrictions through an executive order. An entry on the Supreme Court docket said that the administration can file its new brief on Thursday. Hawaii, which challenged the ban and won in the appeals court, is permitted to file its own brief on June 20, meaning the court is unlikely to act on the emergency application until next week at the earliest.     The court was responding to a request made by Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall, who said in a letter that the ruling on Monday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco means the government needs to file a new brief. In an added dramatic twist, Trump himself plans to go to the  Supreme Court on Thursday for the investiture of Justice Neil Gorsuch, an administration official said. Trump nominated Gorsuch in January. Gorsuch's confirmation by the U.S. Senate in April restored the court's 5-4 conservative majority.  Trump's visit to the court would be his first since he became president on Jan. 20 and would put him face-to-face with the nine justices as they consider the fate of his travel ban unless the court acts before then. It is common practice for presidents to attend such events, which are purely ceremonial. The Supreme Court could discuss how to act on the emergency application at its private conference on June 22, a week after the Gorsuch ceremony.

Hawaii's lawyer, Neal Katyal, filed his own letter objecting to the government's timeline, although he agreed that both sides needed to file briefs responding to Monday's ruling. Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked Trump's 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States. The 9th Circuit largely upheld the Hawaii injunction on Monday. In the second case, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on May 25 upheld the Maryland judge's ruling. The lawsuits by Hawaii and the Maryland challengers argued that the executive order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitution's First Amendment, which prohibits the government from favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. The Supreme Court is weighing emergency applications in both cases, but is likely to act on them together. Trump's first order on Jan. 27 led to chaos and protests at airports and in various cities before being blocked by the courts. The second order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban, but was blocked by judges before it could go into effect on March 16.

When Theresa May met Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Tuesday, their political fortunes could hardly have been more different and neither could their outlooks. The French president is an ardent supporter of the European Union as the best defense against inequalities wrought by globalisation. The British prime minister wants to leave the bloc in  the national interest . While the two briefly raised Brexit - Macron said the door was open for Britain to change its mind and May said she was sticking to her time line - they were more interested in highlighting their common fight against terrorism. Before heading for a dinner of duck liver pate and monkfish and a friendly soccer match between England and France, the two said they would work together to find new ways to encourage firms to clamp down on internet hate speech.  We are launching a joint UK-French campaign to ensure that the internet cannot be used as a safe space for terrorists and criminals, and that it cannot be used to host the radicalising material that leads to so much harm,  May told a joint news conference on the grounds of France's Elysee Palace.  Crucially, our campaign will also include exploring creating a legal liability for tech companies if they fail to take the necessary action to remove unacceptable content.  After two Islamist militant attacks in Britain in less than two weeks, May's bid to clamp down on internet extremism has struck a chord with international leaders, especially Macron, whose country has suffered several jihadist attacks since 2015. To honor the victims of the attacks on London and Manchester that killed 30, the French Republican Guard before the soccer match played the Manchester rock anthem  Don't look back in anger  before a one-minute silence at the Stade de France, where a suicide bomber blew himself up in 2015.

The move likely delays any high court action on the administration's two emergency applications asking for the ban issued on March 6 to immediately go into effect. The March ban was Trump's second effort to impose travel restrictions through an executive order. An entry on the Supreme Court docket said that the administration can file its new brief on Thursday. Hawaii, which challenged the ban and won in the appeals court, is permitted to file its own brief on June 20, meaning the court is unlikely to act on the emergency application until next week at the earliest.     The court was responding to a request made by Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall, who said in a letter that the ruling on Monday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco means the government needs to file a new brief. In an added dramatic twist, Trump himself plans to go to the  Supreme Court on Thursday for the investiture of Justice Neil Gorsuch, an administration official said. Trump nominated Gorsuch in January. Gorsuch's confirmation by the U.S. Senate in April restored the court's 5-4 conservative majority.  Trump's visit to the court would be his first since he became president on Jan. 20 and would put him face-to-face with the nine justices as they consider the fate of his travel ban unless the court acts before then. It is common practice for presidents to attend such events, which are purely ceremonial. The Supreme Court could discuss how to act on the emergency application at its private conference on June 22, a week after the Gorsuch ceremony. U.S. President Donald Trump attends a lunch meeting with members of Congress at the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 13, 2017.Carlos BarriaWall wrote that more time was needed because the 9th Circuit ruling in favor of the state of Hawaii is  the first addressing the executive order at issue to rest relief on statutory rather than constitutional grounds.   Hawaii's lawyer, Neal Katyal, filed his own letter objecting to the government's timeline, although he agreed that both sides needed to file briefs responding to Monday's ruling. Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked Trump's 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States. The 9th Circuit largely upheld the Hawaii injunction on Monday. In the second case, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on May 25 upheld the Maryland judge's ruling. The lawsuits by Hawaii and the Maryland challengers argued that the executive order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitution's First Amendment, which prohibits the government from favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. The Supreme Court is weighing emergency applications in both cases, but is likely to act on them together. Trump's first order on Jan. 27 led to chaos and protests at airports and in various cities before being blocked by the courts. The second order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban, but was blocked by judges before it could go into effect on March 16.

Prices for U.S. pork extended gains to the highest levels in more than two years, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data, boosted by strong retailer demand during summer grilling season, when consumers cook more meat outdoors.     Live cattle         and feeder cattle         each declined to the lowest levels since so far in June as investors locked in profits following last week's multimonth highs. Some traders also were unwinding long cattle and short hog spreads.     CME July hog futures        gained 1.575 cents to 82.275 cents per pound. June hog futures       , which expire on Wednesday, hit a life-of-contract high of 82.850 cents before finishing at 82.775 cents, up 0.800 cent.      The (pork) cutout values continue to hit multiyear highs - that is the driving force,  said Don Roose, president of the U.S. Commodities brokerage.  It's hard for the market to break when the cutout is rising.      Pork prices were up $1.83 to $94.97 per cwt, highest since November 2014, led by gains in rib and pork belly cuts, USDA data showed. Choice-grade beef was down $1.33 to $251.19 per cwt but still was hovering near the highest levels in about 23 months.                         CME August live cattle        finished 0.675 cent lower at 120.875 cents per pound while CME August feeder cattle        fell 1.600 cent to 149.950 cents per pound.     Roose said traders were buying hogs and selling cattle.      Cattle looks a little lofty versus the pork,  he said.  But we have big (hog) supplies ahead of us, basically for the rest of the year.

Researchers examined data on 50,970 women with mammogram results from 2000 to 2010 that indicated the need for further diagnostic imaging. Overall, just 57 percent of Asian women got necessary follow-up tests within a month, compared with 77 percent of white patients, the study found.  This gap in follow-up care persisted at three months for all Asian women except Japanese patients. After one year, 15 percent of Asian women still hadn’t gotten additional imaging done, compared with 10 percent of white patients. Filipina women had the highest odds of no follow-up care, with 18 percent not receiving additional imaging one year after an abnormal mammogram.  “We suspected that there would be differences in delays between white and Asian women, however we were surprised to find the degree of varying delay times among the different Asian subgroups,” said lead study author Kim Hanh Nguyen of the University of California, San Francisco.  “Filipino and Vietnamese women had the poorest outcomes in our study,” Nguyen said by email.  The goal of mammograms is to detect tumors before they can be felt in a physical breast exam, catching cancer sooner when it’s easier to treat. Even though most suspicious findings on mammograms turn out not to be cancer, doctors still urge women to get follow-up tests as quickly as possible so tumors have less time to grow.  Half of white women in the study got follow-up tests within 15 days, compared with 19 days for Japanese women, 28 days for Filipina women and 32 days for Vietnamese women.  Asians are one of the fastest-growing immigrant groups in the U.S., and people who identify as Asian or Asian with another race are projected to account for about 12 percent of the population, or about 49 million people, by 2060, the researchers note in the journal Cancer.  Previous studies highlighting disparities in mammogram follow-up care have often had too few Asian women to detect differences among ethnic subgroups, Nguyen said. The current study offers fresh insight into which Asian women are most at risk for delays that could lead to worse survival odds.  “Ethnic groups tend to share cultural traits such as physical appearance, beliefs and language or dialect, and group history, and these group characteristics can affect their breast cancer care experience in meaningful ways,” Nguyen said. “These findings can inform public health programs to tailor outreach to Asian women, particularly Filipinos and Vietnamese or other Southeast Asians.” One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on certain factors that might influence how quickly women got follow-up tests, such as breast symptoms or prior mammogram results, the authors note. It’s also possible that recent immigration or limited English skills might have contributed to longer follow-up times for some women.  Some women and their doctors might also have decided against follow-up imaging after considering the risks of additional tests such as unnecessary biopsies or treatment of tumors that would have been unlikely to prove fatal, said Dr. Gerd Gigerenzer, director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin.  “It could well be that Asian women are more aware of the lack of benefit and the likely harms of screening than white American women, or intuitively feel that harms are likely,” Gigerenzer, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  There also isn’t consensus in the medical community about exactly how quickly women need to get follow-up tests, noted Dr. Joann Elmore, a researcher at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle who wasn’t involved in the study.  “My advice to women is to work with their physicians and to schedule follow-up for an abnormal mammogram result as quickly as their schedule allows,” Elmore said by email. “As most women with these abnormalities do not end up having breast cancer, the anxiety experienced by women during this wait is their biggest risk.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2spiqRl Cancer, online June 12, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-asianamericans-breast-screenin-idUSKBN1942WF"},

Cuomo on Tuesday called the decision by State Supreme Court Justice Richard Velasquez in Brooklyn, which also upheld other tenant protections adopted in 2014, a victory for the more than 2 million rent-regulated tenants in the state. The tenant protection unit was created within the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal in 2012, pursuant to a law adopted the prior year that curbed landlords' ability to raise rents and charge market rates by deregulating units.

Patrol officers and detectives will go on 12-hour shifts through the weekend, instead of the normal 10-hour stints, and all other officers will be placed in squad cars or on foot patrols, Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said. The six homicides raised the number of killings in the city of 620,000 people to 158 for the year. The pace is 27 percent ahead of that in 2015, when Baltimore notched its second-highest number of homicides this century, according to police figures.  We're just as angry and frustrated and ticked off about it as anyone else watching, and I expect people to be upset,  Davis said at a news conference.  The police commissioner said Baltimore was facing a lethal combination of drugs, guns and gangs as crime groups battled for turf. Officers this month seized 30 kg (66 pounds) of the opioid fentanyl and 15 kg (33 pounds) of heroin bound for West Baltimore, one of the deadliest gang battlegrounds, he said. FILE PHOTO: Newly appointed Interim Police Commissioner Kevin Davis looks on during a news conference in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S. on July 8, 2015.Bryan Woolston/File PhotoThe overnight violence on Tuesday included a woman gunned down by a masked shooter and two people fatally shot in an apparent drug dispute, Davis said. The East Coast city has increased coverage by officers during prior spikes in violence. Davis, who did not specify how many more officers would be on the streets, said officials would evaluate the effort's results next week.  The violence comes as the Baltimore police department, the nation's eighth biggest, is under a federal court order to remedy widespread civil rights abuses uncovered by a U.S. Justice Department review. The review was triggered by the 2015 death of a suspect from injuries in police custody that sparked arson and rioting.  Mayor Catherine Pugh, during activities last weekend dubbed  Call to Action,  urged city residents to do more to help combat crime, such as mentoring young people or giving ex-offenders jobs. Baltimore's rise in homicides has tracked an uptick in U.S. murders. Preliminary Federal Bureau of Investigation data shows a 5.2 percent increase of murders in the first half of 2016 from the year before.

Shaw was the most influential gainer on the index, ending up 3.1 percent at C$29.42 after saying it would sell its ViaWest subsidiary for $1.675 billion, while the majority-owner of the company that sold Shaw the spectrum, Quebecor Inc, also gained 3.1 percent, to C$41.86. The telecom group lost 0.5 percent, with BCE Inc down 0.7 percent at C$59.45, after the departing head of the country's telecom and broadcast regulator said his as-yet unnamed replacement may have to intervene in wireless markets to stoke competition. The financials group slipped 0.2 percent, with Royal Bank of Canada down 0.4 percent to C$93.89 and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce off 0.6 percent at C$106.16.  They (Canadian banks) had a pretty good run late last week, with a flight to quality it seems a lot of the fast money came out of tech and got parked in the banks temporarily,  said Bruce Latimer, a trader at Eight Capital. A bounce back in U.S. technology stocks after a sharp two-day decline helped several Wall Street indices close at record highs.

Investors seem to be engaged in  under the surface sector rotation  at the moment, said Mike Archibald, associate portfolio manager at AGF Investments.  To me, it's reflective that there is still a good amount of uncertainty by most market participants right now,  he said. First Quantum Minerals Ltd fell 4 percent to C$11.43 and Hudbay Minerals Inc lost 4.9 percent to C$7.23, which Archibald ascribed to positioning ahead of Chinese economic data due out overnight. Energy stocks ended 0.4 percent higher overall, with Encana Corp up 2.1 percent at C$12.84. Sears Canada Inc sank 23.7 percent to 87 Canadian cents after the retailer flagged doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern and said it was exploring strategic options, including a sale of the company. Interest rate cuts instituted in 2015 have largely done their job as the Canadian economy gathers momentum, the Bank of Canada's head said on Tuesday, the second top official in as many days to set the stage for eventual rate hikes.

The decision to interview Jones, whose ideas are widely discredited, angered some relatives of those who died in 2012 when a 20-year-old man fatally shot 20 first-graders and six educators at the elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. It prompted a gun control nonprofit linked to some of the victims' families to cancel its invitation for Kelly to host a fundraising gala on Wednesday in Washington.  And JPMorgan Chase will pull its local advertisements on NBC News programming until after the interview airs on Sunday, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Kelly said in a statement she understood and respected the concerns and she found Jones' suggestion that Sandy Hook was a hoax  personally revolting  as does  every other rational person.  But she said it left many wondering how Jones and his  outrageous conspiracy theories  have the respect of millions including Trump, who she said has elevated Jones by praising him and appearing on his show.  Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light - as journalists are supposed to do - on this influential figure, and yes - to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity,  Kelly said. The NBC television network is part of NBC Universal, which is owned by Comcast Corp. Jones founded the ultra conservative website Infowars. In a statement on Sunday rescinding Kelly's invite to host their gala, the Sandy Hook Promise nonprofit said it hoped she and NBC would reconsider and not broadcast the interview. A JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal report. But a senior bank executive spoke out on Twitter.   As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why?  Kristin Lemkau, chief marketing officer at JPMorgan Chase, tweeted on Monday. Her reference to Aurora regarded the murder of a dozen people by a gunman who opened fire inside a packed movie theater in the Denver suburb in 2012.

Researchers ran 18 simulations comparing how long it took a drone and traditional EMS to reach various locations within a 10-kilometer (6.2 mile) radius of a fire station north of Stockholm. The drone consistently beat typical EMS response times, by almost 17 minutes in half of the cases.  “With drones carrying automated external defibrillators (AEDs) we may increase chances of survival significantly (by) delivering an AED within the very first minutes,” said lead study author Andreas Claesson of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. In cardiac arrest, the heart stops abruptly, often due to irregular heart rhythms. Cardiac arrest may occur with no warning and is often fatal unless the heart can be restarted quickly. Only about one in 10 patients typically survive a cardiac arrest when it happens outside a hospital, and reducing the time it takes to shock the heart back into a normal rhythm with a defibrillator is the biggest factor influencing survival odds, the researchers note in JAMA.  Automated external defibrillators are already common in public places like restaurants and airports. These devices typically have electrodes that attach to the chest with sticky pads and deliver shocks based on what a computer in the defibrillator determines the person needs. Someday, emergency dispatchers might be able to respond to cardiac arrests by sending out drones with defibrillators that bystanders at the scene could use on cardiac arrest patients until EMS arrived. This shift might be especially helpful for improving survival odds in remote rural areas and resort communities that swell in population during the summer months, Claesson said by email.  The drone used in the study was equipped with a global positioning system (GPS), a high-definition camera and an autopilot software system. Even though it could use GPS to fly on autopilot, a pilot was present at the landing locations and the dispatcher could take over the drone for descent if necessary.  For the study, researchers pitted the drone’s performance in test flights conducted over 72 hours in October 2016 to the actual dispatch and arrival times for EMS in real cardiac arrest cases that occurred from 2006 to 2014. Half of the emergencies in the simulations were at least 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) away from the fire station. In half of the cases, the drone took no more than three seconds to take off after the emergency calls came in, compared with three minutes for EMS.  With the drone, the time from dispatch to arrival at the scene of the emergency was only about five minutes in half of the cases, compared with 22 minutes for EMS. Limitations of the study include the small number of test flights, which were all done in good weather, the authors note.  The drones also had some advantages in this experiment that they might not have in real life, said Dr. Peter Pons, a professor emeritus of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver who wasn’t involved in the study.  Drones, for example, might not work well in bad weather and might have a limited flight range, Pons said by email. At the same time, an ambulance involves several steps, including getting the necessary information on the location and the patient, notifying and assembling an EMS crew, and then getting the ambulance underway, Pons said.  For the same cost it might require to build a drone network just to deliver defibrillators to cardiac arrest patients, it might be possible to instead expand EMS services to speed response times in all types of emergencies, Pons said.  Still, he thinks drones could make a big difference in cardiac arrest survival odds.  “The time savings reported in this letter would clearly provide a meaningful improvement in the outcome of victims of cardiac arrest,” Pons said. “We know that for each minute that CPR and defibrillation are delayed, survival from cardiac arrest decreases.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2sYZ6Yv JAMA, online June 13, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-emergencies-drones-idUSKBN1942U2"},

Poloz said that the central bank's 2015 interest rate cuts  have largely done their work,  signalling that the BOC could raise interest rates sooner than previously thought. Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said late on Monday that first-quarter growth in Canada had been  pretty impressive,  and that signs economic growth was broadening would lead the central bank to consider whether current low rates would still be required.   It's one of the biggest moves we've seen over the past year  in the Canadian dollar, said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto.  That's dragging some of the dollar bloc currencies with it.  Speculators have more than 120,000 short contracts on the Canadian dollar, with net short bets remaining near a record high, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters.      The market had been overlooking the strengthening economic data from Canada, and obviously now that we’re starting to see some change in communication from the Bank of Canada to acknowledge that ... the market won’t be able to look through that,  said MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman, in London.   The shift to a more hawkish stance will offer the potential for the Canadian dollar to strengthen further from here.  The U.S. dollar fell to C$1.3209, its lowest since Feb. 28. The U.S. dollar also fell against the Mexican peso to 18.05, hitting its lowest since August 2016. The greenback has fallen nearly 13 percent against the peso this year and more than 18 percent since hitting a record high against the Mexican currency in mid-January. The dollar fell 0.15 against a basket of currencies to a five-day low ahead of the start of the Federal Open Market Committee's June policy meeting, as the euro edged higher, staying just above $1.12. Investors' focus Wednesday will be on the Fed's statement following the meeting and its assessment of the economy and inflation outlook.  Since the market is widely expecting the Fed to raise interest rates, the foreign exchange market reaction is likely to come more from any signalling with regards to the future path of monetary policy normalization,  said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. Investors will also be watching for any fresh details on the central bank's plans for trimming its balance sheet. Sterling regained almost the whole of its losses from Monday, rising 0.75 percent.

Interest rate cuts instituted in 2015 have largely done their job as the Canadian economy gathers momentum, the Bank of Canada's head said, the second top official in as many days to set the stage for rate hikes.                   Chances of an interest rate hike this year have surged to three-in-four from less than one-in-four before stronger than expected jobs data on Friday, data from the overnight index swaps market shows.                At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3237 to the greenback, or 75.55 U.S. cents, up 0.7 percent.     The currency's weakest level was C$1.3325, while it touched its strongest since Feb. 28 at C$1.3212.     Strengthening of the currency could put pressure on often-leveraged speculators to cover short positions and accelerate any move higher in the currency.                   The market was excessively short Canadian dollars, so this could be a move that is a little bit overdone,  said Michael Goshko, Corporate Risk Manager at Western Union Business Solutions.

The large corporate, experienced, well-heeled buyer ... they have been planning for this move and they're executing on it,  said Brad Schruder, director of corporate sales and structuring at BMO Capital Markets.     Adding to support for the loonie, prices of oil, one of the country's major exports, edged higher after OPEC detailed supply cuts around the world.           U.S. crude oil futures        settled 38 cents higher at $46.46 a barrel.

Last week, Peru approved new air and water quality standards consistent with Kuczynski's goal of persuading mining companies to invest more in metals processing to add value to the Andean country's mineral exports.  The environmental standards were unrealistic for smelters and processing plants, and with the new standards Grupo Mexico is thinking of doubling its smelting in Peru,  Kuczynski said during a meeting with businesses in Spain broadcast by Peruvian state television. Grupo Mexico owns Southern Copper , which operates the Toquepala and Cuajone copper mines and the Ilo smelter in Peru. Last year, the Ilo smelter processed 1 million tonnes of copper concentrate and the facility has a total capacity of 1.2 million tonnes. Representatives of Southern Copper did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Kuczynski's remarks. Peru is the world's No. 2 copper producer and mining represents 60 percent of its exports. Kuczynski has said the new environmental standards are more in line with Chile and Colombia.

The S&P; 500, Dow industrials and Russell 2000 set record closing highs. The S&P; technology index .SPLRCT ended up 0.9 percent after a two-session selloff that put the spotlight on areas of the stock market where valuations appear stretched. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday and may also provide details on its plans to shrink $4.5 trillion of assets it amassed to nurse the economic recovery. Analysts say the Fed could take an aggressively hawkish posture of signaling a balance sheet reduction this year and another rate increase in December. Short-dated U.S. Treasury yields briefly hit multi-week highs but the market was barely changed after a strong 30-year debt auction ahead of Wednesday's Fed decision. Short-dated Treasuries in particular are considered most vulnerable to Fed rate increases. U.S. three-year Treasury US3YT=RR yields hit 1.511 percent, their highest since May 16, while two-year yields US2YT=RR touched their highest in a month at 1.367 percent. Yields eased from session highs to be roughly unchanged from levels as of late Monday, with three- and two-year yields last at 1.503 percent and 1.363 percent, respectively.  The markets have to build in a little bit of risk that the Fed may say something about tapering tomorrow,  said John Herrmann, director of interest rates strategy at MUFG Securities in New York.

The decision to interview Jones, whose ideas are widely discredited, angered some relatives of those who died in 2012 when a 20-year-old man fatally shot 20 first-graders and six educators at the elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. It prompted a gun control nonprofit linked to some of the victims' families to cancel its invitation for Kelly to host a fundraising gala on Wednesday in Washington.  And JPMorgan Chase will pull its local advertisements on NBC News programming until after the interview airs on Sunday, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Kelly said in a statement she understood and respected the concerns and she found Jones' suggestion that Sandy Hook was a hoax  personally revolting  as does  every other rational person.  But she said it left many wondering how Jones and his  outrageous conspiracy theories  have the respect of millions including Trump, who she said has elevated Jones by praising him and appearing on his show.  Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light - as journalists are supposed to do - on this influential figure, and yes - to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity,  Kelly said. The NBC television network is part of NBC Universal, which is owned by Comcast Corp. Jones founded the ultra conservative website Infowars. In a statement on Sunday rescinding Kelly's invite to host their gala, the Sandy Hook Promise nonprofit said it hoped she and NBC would reconsider and not broadcast the interview. A JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal report. But a senior bank executive spoke out on Twitter.   As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why?  Kristin Lemkau, chief marketing officer at JPMorgan Chase, tweeted on Monday. Her reference to Aurora regarded the murder of a dozen people by a gunman who opened fire inside a packed movie theater in the Denver suburb in 2012.

Republican Senator John Thune, who chairs the Commerce Committee, Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the panel, and Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said in a joint statement that existing federal vehicle regulations written over recent decades did not account for self-driving cars without a human driver behind the wheel. Thune said the senators hoped to reach agreement based on  prioritizing safety, fixing outdated rules, and clarifying the role of federal and state governments.  Federal auto regulations pose significant legal hurdles that must be cleared before fully self-driving cars can be sold without steering wheels and gas pedals, a government report said last year. The Senate Commerce Committee is holding a hearing on self-driving cars on Wednesday. Mitch Bainwol, head of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an auto trade group, will tell the panel that Congress should work to eliminate state or local laws that could  unduly burden or restrict the use of self-driving vehicles in the future.  The senators are joining a broader movement in Washington to respond to calls from Detroit and Silicon Valley for federal action to set rules for self-driving cars, rather than allowing states such as California to write potentially conflicting rules. The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee told Reuters last week he planned to unveil a package of legislation to overhaul federal rules governing self-driving vehicles. Companies such as Alphabet Inc, General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG are pursuing automated technologies and want unified federal regulations to replace outdated rules and make it simpler to develop and eventually sell the technology across the country. In April, automakers and technology companies urged California to make changes to its proposed state regulations governing autonomous vehicles. Many oppose California's plan to require a state permit to deploy autonomous vehicles, which must meet performance and design criteria. The U.S. Transportation Department said last week it would unveil revised self-driving guidelines within the next few months, responding to automakers' calls for regulations to sanction costly efforts to put autonomous vehicles on the road. Vehicle crashes annually kill more than 35,000 people on U.S. roads and injure 2.4 million. The economic cost of vehicle crashes is at least $240 billion annually, the government says.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-selfdriving-idUSL1N1JA1Z6"},

Corruption allegations against Temer, who could be formally charged by prosecutors in coming weeks, threaten to derail his government's market-friendly drive, which includes a pension reform and legislation to flexibilize the labor market.   A reduction of the 4.5 percent inflation target for 2019, which was expected before the crisis erupted, could help the government gain market support, said the official who asked for anonymity to speak freely.   The cost of cutting the target is very low while its gains are high in the eyes of the market,  said the official, adding that he supports a new target of 4 percent. A two-year recession has dragged down Brazil's annual inflation rate to its lowest in 10 years in May. Consumer prices as measured by the benchmark IPCA index rose 3.60 percent in the 12 months through May, down from an increase of 4.08 percent in the previous month. Inflation is expected to end 2017 at 3.71 percent, according to a central bank weekly survey of economists. The sharp drop has raised calls for a target reduction despite worries that political turmoil could undermine the pension reform needed to cap government spending and keep future inflation at bay.  Another senior economic team member told Reuters last week that the falling inflation rate will be a key factor when the National Monetary Council, the country's top economic policy body, meets later in June to decide on the 2019 target. The council, which is made up of the finance and planning ministers and central bank chief, is scheduled to meet on June 29.  Eighteen of 29 economists surveyed by Reuters in late May expected the 2019 goal to be reduced, with analysts split over a symbolic cut to 4.25 percent or a more aggressive move to 4.0 or 3.5 percent.

The company said it plans to enter Kansas, Missouri and Nevada in 2018, as well as expand its operations in six existing markets: Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. The move is in contrast to some other insurers, which have blamed Republicans for not doing enough to stabilize the marketplace, particularly in guaranteeing the continued payment of Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies next year. The subsidies are available to low-income Americans who buy individual health insurance on the exchanges created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. Republican lawmakers and Trump have promised to repeal and replace the law but have disagreed over the details, creating uncertainty at a time when insurers must submit plans and premium rates for 2018.

Algeria has joined with North African neighbor Tunisia to seek support for an inclusive dialogue in Libya, where competing governments and armed supporters have struggled for control since a 2011 civil war ousted veteran leader Muammar Gaddafi.  France aims to play a bigger role in bringing Libya's factions together to end the turmoil that has allowed Islamist militants to gain a foothold and migrant smugglers to flourish in the absence of a strong central government.  The main objective remains the fight against terrorism in this area of turbulence, where the presence of terrorists is reinforced because of the chaotic situation in Libya,  Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel said after talks with France's Jean-Yves Le Drian, according to state news agency APS. Le Drian, on a two-day visit to Algiers, described his talks with Messahel as  thorough . French officials fear Islamic State militants - who were driven from the coastal city of Sirte last year - and other jihadists are trying to exploit the power vacuum in Libya to regroup after losing substantial ground in Syria and Iraq.  A U.N.-backed Libyan government of national accord has sat in Tripoli for more than a year, but it has struggled to reach agreement with eastern factions, including with powerful commander Khalifa Haftar. Libya's neighbors and regional powers have often differed on how to help. Egypt is closer to Haftar and his anti-Islamist militant campaign while Algeria has pushed for an inclusive approach including using the influence of Tunisia's moderate Islamists. Last week Le Drian last week held talks with Egypt on how to stabilize Libya and on Monday began a two-day visit to Algiers, where he said he had  thorough  talks with his Algerian counterpart Abdelkader Messahel. Last year Islamic State was driven out of the Libyan coastal city of Sirte.   It is this determination which leads us to wish for a political solution in Libya,  APS quoted Le Drian as saying. Algeria and France have agreed to  combine their efforts to reach an inclusive political solution that allows the integrity of Libyan territory and a peace process , Le Drian added. Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt last week expressed support for dialogue in Libya and rejected foreign interference or any military options, days after Egyptian jets carried out strikes against militant camps inside Libya. The talks between Le Drian and Messahel also included the situation in the Sahel, two years after Algeria helped mediate a peace deal in Mali between the government and Tuareg rebels, in part to help stop Islamist militants gaining ground.

Following the close, crude prices slipped after industry group the American Petroleum Institute said crude stocks rose by a surprising 2.8 million barrels for the week to June 9, counter to forecasts for a 2.7 million-barrel drawdown.  Benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 settled 43 cents higher at $48.72 a barrel while U.S. light crude CLc1 settled up 38 cents to $46.46 a barrel.  The market will watch to see whether the API data is confirmed by official figures due Wednesday morning from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).  The world's top exporter Saudi Arabia outlined cuts to customers in July that included a reduction of 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) to Asia as well as deeper cuts in allocations to the United States. Riyadh is leading an effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other oil producers to cut output by almost 1.8 million bpd until March 2018 to curb oversupply. Those efforts thus far have largely not succeeded. Brent futures are trading at higher prices for further-dated contracts, which is an encouragement for more production rather than less.   Crude oil is still struggling to rebound,  said Olivier Jakob, strategist at Petromatrix, adding that OPEC's gradual approach to rebalancing was giving U.S. producers time to drill new wells that were undermining the impact of the group's cuts. OPEC's monthly report showed output from the group rose by 336,000 bpd in May to 32.14 million bpd, led by a recovery in Nigeria and Libya which are exempt from supply cuts. The report said the market was rebalancing at a  slower pace.   By some accounts this increase is a troubling threat to OPEC compliance, but we note that it was driven by 352,000 bpd of additional supply from Libya and Nigeria,  wrote Tim Evans, energy analyst at Citigroup. The market's weakness can be seen in technical activity surrounding Brent crude, where the 50-day moving average fell through the 200-day moving average on Monday, an indicator of a near-term weakening trend also known as a  death cross.   The last time this happened, in mid-2014, preceded a massive selloff in oil that dropped Brent from $108 a barrel to about $47 a barrel in the span of five months. Trade data show OPEC shipments to customers averaged around 26 million bpd in the last six months of 2016 and are set to average around 25.3 million bpd in the first half of this year. U.S. drilling activity has continued apace RIG-OL-USA-BHI, driving up U.S. output C-OUT-T-EIA by more than 10 percent since mid-2016 to above 9.3 million bpd.

Trump hosted Republican senators for lunch at the White House on Tuesday in a bid to help the lawmakers find common ground to move forward with healthcare reform legislation this summer. At the start of the lunch, Trump told the lawmakers their healthcare bill would need to be  generous  and  kind.   That may be adding additional money into it,  he said, without offering details on how much money might be needed or how it might be used. Trump stepped up pressure for the repeal with a tweet Tuesday morning declaring that the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare,  is in a death spiral.  He cited the government's announcement Monday that some 2 million people who signed up for Obamacare have dropped out this year. Although Trump's Republican Party has a majority in both houses of Congress, Trump blamed  obstructionist  Democrats for the lack of progress in repealing President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement. Senator John Thune, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, who attended the lunch meeting, said Trump was open to suggestions that some federal cost-sharing payments to health insurers under Obamacare continue in the near term but that the president did not make any definite pronouncements on that issue. Those payments help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans. Trump has said he might consider withholding them but  insurers say that would wreak havoc in the markets. Thune also said Trump did not give any deadlines to the senators on passing the bill.  I hope that we can stay on schedule to have floor action before the Fourth of July break,  Thune said. The House of Representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month but Senate Republicans have been unable to coalesce around their own version of a bill, with moderates and conservatives pushing in different directions in meetings behind closed doors. The senators Trump invited to lunch included Republicans from both ideological camps. Moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were on the list as well as conservatives Ted Cruz and Mike Lee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said senators are closer to bringing up a proposal and other Republicans have predicted for some time that a bill would be ready for a vote before the August recess. Senate aides said the Senate bill was not expected to touch insurance protections that are included in Obamacare for people with pre-existing medical conditions. The House bill was widely criticized for letting states seek waivers from those protections. In states with such waivers, people with pre-existing conditions could still get coverage but they would not be shielded against potentially higher costs. Another senator at the lunch, Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, said after the meeting that there still was a lot of work to do before legislation can be unveiled.  The total bill hasn't been resolved,  he said. (Additional reporting by Ayesha Rascoe, Richard Cowan)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-healthcare-idUSL1N1JA1XT"},

Following the close, crude prices slipped after industry group the American Petroleum Institute said crude stocks rose by a surprising 2.8 million barrels for the week to June 9, counter to forecasts for a 2.7 million-barrel drawdown.  Benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 settled 43 cents higher at $48.72 a barrel while U.S. light crude CLc1 settled up 38 cents to $46.46 a barrel.  The market will watch to see whether the API data is confirmed by official figures due Wednesday morning from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).  The world's top exporter Saudi Arabia outlined cuts to customers in July that included a reduction of 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) to Asia as well as deeper cuts in allocations to the United States. Riyadh is leading an effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other oil producers to cut output by almost 1.8 million bpd until March 2018 to curb oversupply. Those efforts thus far have largely not succeeded. Brent futures are trading at higher prices for further-dated contracts, which is an encouragement for more production rather than less.   Crude oil is still struggling to rebound,  said Olivier Jakob, strategist at Petromatrix, adding that OPEC's gradual approach to rebalancing was giving U.S. producers time to drill new wells that were undermining the impact of the group's cuts. OPEC's monthly report showed output from the group rose by 336,000 bpd in May to 32.14 million bpd, led by a recovery in Nigeria and Libya which are exempt from supply cuts. The report said the market was rebalancing at a  slower pace.   By some accounts this increase is a troubling threat to OPEC compliance, but we note that it was driven by 352,000 bpd of additional supply from Libya and Nigeria,  wrote Tim Evans, energy analyst at Citigroup. The market's weakness can be seen in technical activity surrounding Brent crude, where the 50-day moving average fell through the 200-day moving average on Monday, an indicator of a near-term weakening trend also known as a  death cross.   The last time this happened, in mid-2014, preceded a massive selloff in oil that dropped Brent from $108 a barrel to about $47 a barrel in the span of five months. Trade data show OPEC shipments to customers averaged around 26 million bpd in the last six months of 2016 and are set to average around 25.3 million bpd in the first half of this year. U.S. drilling activity has continued apace RIG-OL-USA-BHI, driving up U.S. output C-OUT-T-EIA by more than 10 percent since mid-2016 to above 9.3 million bpd. Traders said market intelligence firm Genscape had forecast a draw down of more than 1.8 million barrels at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for U.S. crude futures.

Fund managers such as T Rowe Price and Federated Investors, who were already overweight the sector, said they were buying beaten-down so-called 'FANG' stocks – Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) - during a two-day selloff that marked the largest tech sector decline in nearly a year.  Google, Apple and other large tech stocks rose modestly in morning trading Tuesday. Jeff Rottinghaus, portfolio manager of the T Rowe Price Large-Cap Core Equity fund (PAULX.O), said he has been adding money to existing tech holdings such as Facebook and Amazon because they are positioned to continue to grow over the next few years regardless of the direction of the overall economy. With other secular growth stories hard to find,  It's getting to the point where you have to say, 'What else do you want me to own?'  he said, adding that these companies continue to be up significantly year-to-date despite recent declines.  Analysts expect the S&P; 500 technology index .SPLRCT to grow its earnings by 12.4 percent this year, better than the S&P; 500's 11.6-percent expected growth, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  About 40 percent of the stocks in the S&P; 500 information technology index rose on Monday, including Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), which have lagged in 2017.      This tech selloff is a great buying opportunity,  said Navellier & Associates Chairman Louis Navellier, who bought shares of Micron Technology Inc (MU.O), Applied Materials Inc (AMAT.O), Arista Networks Inc (ANET.N) and STMicroelectronics NV (STM.PA). In the 8-year-old bull market, investors have consistently been 'buying the dips,' taking advantage of brief pullbacks in prices, so large-cap stocks have not seen a 10-percent correction in well over a year. Although stocks are expensive by historical measures, bullish investors say they are justified by growth in earnings and the U.S. economy, while historically low bond yields are also making stocks more appealing. FILE PHOTO: A zoomed illustration image of a man looking at a computer monitor showing the logo of Amazon is seen in Vienna, Austria, on November 26, 2012.Leonhard Foeger/File PhotoComeback of the 'Trump Trade?' The stumble in tech comes a time when both mutual funds and hedge funds have taken outsized bets on the sector, helping push Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft to add a total $600 billion in market cap year-to-date. Tech stocks in the S&P; 500 rallied 21 percent for the year through June 2nd, with the largest companies accounting for 46 percent of the S&P; 500's 9-percent gain, according to Goldman Sachs.  That rally sent some tech-heavy tech funds soaring.  In May, Light Street Capital Management's $1.2-billion Halogen fund was up 11 percent and is up 42.6 percent this year through the end of May. The head of the fund, Glen Kacher, started his career at Tiger Management, Julian Robertson's famous fund.  Yet concerns that fund managers had piled into the same stocks and stretched their valuations helped prompt a selloff that began Friday and continued through Monday, sapping 5 percent or more from companies such as Apple.  Momentum-based technology stocks have  built a valuation air pocket underneath [them] creating cause for pause,  Goldman Sachs wrote in a note Friday. Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York, said he saw the tech selloff as a sign that investors were feeling more confident that the Trump administration could pass infrastructure or tax legislation later this year.  Last week's testimony by former FBI chief James Comey did not contain the sort of bombshell that investors had feared, Chiavarone said, prompting fund managers to rotate out of tech into sectors that have lagged.   It allowed folks to believe once again that Congress isn't going to be bogged down in a massive impeachment effort and could get some policy work done,  he said, which would benefit energy and financial stocks that initially rallied following Trump's unexpected victory but lost their gains following Inauguration Day.

Last May, the government announced plans to select a developer by October 2016 and begin construction this month. The World Bank announced it had suspended funding for Inga 3 last July after the presidency took control of the project from the prime minister's office, raising concerns about transparency . A brief statement from the presidency gave no reason for the latest decision, which affects the China Three Gorges Corporation and a consortium that includes engineering giant Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA . The project along the Congo River will expand on two existing Inga hydroelectric dams and is part of an eight-stage Grand Inga project that would produce a record 44,000 MW at an estimated cost of $50 billion to $80 billion. Proponents say it could one day power half of Africa. Critics say the money would be better spent supporting smaller local plants.  The two consortiums have been invited ... to do everything possible to form a single group before submitting an optimized bid,  said a statement from the presidency. Of Inga 3's 4,800 MW, 2,500 will be sold to South Africa and 1,300 is earmarked for Congo's mining sector.

The joint alert from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said that  cyber actors of the North Korean government  had targeted the media, aerospace and financial sectors, as well as critical infrastructure, in the United States and globally. North Korea has routinely denied involvement in cyber attacks against other countries. The North Korean mission to the United Nations was not immediately available for comment. The alert said Hidden Cobra has compromised a range of victims since 2009 and that some intrusions had resulted in thefts of data while others were disruptive. The group's capabilities include denial of service attacks, which send reams of junk traffic to a server to knock it offline, keyloggers, remote access tools and several variants of malware, the alert said. Hidden Cobra commonly targets systems that run older versions of Microsoft Corp operating systems that are no longer patched, the alert said. North Korean hacking activity has grown increasingly hostile in recent years, according to Western officials and cyber security experts. The cyber firm Symantec Corp said last month it was  highly likely  that a hacking group affiliated with North Korea called Lazarus Group was behind the WannaCry cyber attack that infected more than 300,000 computers worldwide, disrupting operations at hospitals, banks and schools. Tuesday's alert said Hidden Cobra's cyber attacks have been previously referred to by private sector experts as Lazarus Group and Guardians of the Peace, which have been linked to attacks such as the 2014 intrusion into Sony Corp's Sony Pictures Entertainment.

Trump,Hillary Clinton,Michael Horowitz,Tom Carper,USA,CONGRESS/TRUMP,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. Senate Democrats on Tuesday called for government-wide investigations into the Trump administration's use of secretive messaging phone applications and whether officials are ignoring or delaying responses to some Congressional oversight requests. Delaware Senator Tom Carper and Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill, both influential members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, asked the inspectors general at 24 executive agencies and departments to investigate whether officials are using apps for work that make it hard to trace communications. The apps encrypt messages and automatically delete them after they are read, which could run afoul of laws on preserving government records, the senators wrote. While Republicans control both the Senate and the House of Representatives, Democrats in Congress can still request that inspectors general, neutral investigators who check up on various federal offices, look into specific matters. They also asked the inspectors general if officials in the administration of Republican President Donald Trump are directing employees of government agencies to ignore requests for information from Democrats in Congress. Members of both parties objected after the administration said agencies do not have to honor requests made by senior Democrats on congressional committees. Democrats and public interest groups are worried that the Trump administration is hiding important information about possible wrongdoing and stonewalling potential critics. They are also worried about social media, where Trump has tweeted and then later deleted posts. The office of the Department of Justice's inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who also chairs the council of federal inspectors general, declined to comment on the letter.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The federal government has strict laws on preserving records, which can be used to uncover and prosecute public corruption and collusion. Inspectors general themselves often rely on archived emails and text messages in investigations. Since Trump's inauguration in January many Washington insiders have embraced messaging apps that promptly destroy chats, encrypt texts and phone calls, and leave no trace of communication on smartphones. Concerns about information security have grown in the wake of the hack of the Democratic party's emails, criticism of candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private server and laws that count communications from non-government accounts as federal records. Journalists and officials now frequently communicate via the encrypted Signal or Confide messenger apps. Confide is so popular that the company hosted a media and technology event during this year's White House Correspondents Dinner weekend.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-trump-idUSL1N1JA1WV"},

Customers who switch to Sprint before June 30 and bring their own devices will get free service until July 31, 2018, the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier said. After that, Sprint's regular rates for unlimited plans will kick in, at $60 per month for a single line. The promotion mainly targets Verizon Communications Inc customers through digital advertising, Sprint spokesman David Tovar said by phone. Sprint shares rose 0.6 percent to close at $8.26. Verizon fell 1.5 percent, and both T-Mobile US Inc and AT&T; Inc lost about 1 percent. The S&P; 500 Telecommunications Services Index was the weakest of the benchmark S&P; Index's 11 sectors after the launch, with a 1 percent decline mostly driven by Verizon and AT&T.; Since the offer will be promoted digitally rather than on television, the cost of winning customers is lower than for Sprint's other unlimited plan promotions. Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a research note on Tuesday called the offer  arguably the most aggressive promotion in the history of the U.S. wireless industry.  All four major U.S. wireless carriers have been sweetening their unlimited plan offers, prompting concerns from industry analysts about an accelerating price war. But Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, said the promotion  makes a really big splash in a really small pool,  noting that it primarily applied to Verizon users because of the phones that are eligible.

The agreement, which needs approval from Congress and the 20 provincial legislatures, sets a 3 percent ceiling on royalties mining companies pay to provinces.  It's an activity that could be one of the pillars of job creation,  President Mauricio Macri said of mining at the signing ceremony.  We can develop it with perfect care of the environment.  Latin America's third-largest economy has fallen behind Chile and Peru in attracting mining investment despite rich deposits of copper, gold, silver and zinc. Macri's center-right government has been trying since last year to unify regulations to woo foreign miners. Shortly after taking office, Macri eliminated export taxes on metals and lifted a prohibition on companies sending profits overseas, two moves celebrated by the sector. But seven of the country's 23 provinces still prohibit certain practices, like open-pit mining and the use of cyanide, crucial to extraction. Despite the limit on royalties, the deal signed on Tuesday would allow provinces to levy a tax of up to 1.5 percent of miners' sales for local infrastructure funds.  The new deal doesn't change the regressive nature of the current tax, which is on mineral sales, and furthermore adds another tax of 1.5 percent. It will reduce the sector's competitiveness,  said an industry source who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Investments will continue to favor Chile and Peru.  Among the three provinces that declined to sign the deal was Chubut, located in the southern region of Patagonia, where Pan American Silver's Navidad project has been on hold since 2013 when it ran afoul of provincial rules banning the use of cyanide and open-pit mining. Manuel Jaramillo, executive director of environmental NGO Fundacion Vida Silvestre, told Reuters that environmental groups were not invited to participate in the crafting of the deal and that the government never requested public comment on the details of the agreement.

Customers who switch to Sprint before June 30 and bring their own devices will get free service until July 31, 2018, the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier said. After that, Sprint's regular rates for unlimited plans will kick in, at $60 per month for a single line. The promotion mainly targets Verizon Communications Inc customers through digital advertising, Sprint spokesman David Tovar said by phone. Sprint shares rose 0.6 percent to close at $8.26. Verizon fell 1.5 percent, and both T-Mobile US Inc and AT&T; Inc lost about 1 percent. The S&P; 500 Telecommunications Services Index was the weakest of the benchmark S&P; Index's 11 sectors after the launch, with a 1 percent decline mostly driven by Verizon and AT&T.; Since the offer will be promoted digitally rather than on television, the cost of winning customers is lower than for Sprint's other unlimited plan promotions. Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a research note on Tuesday called the offer  arguably the most aggressive promotion in the history of the U.S. wireless industry.  All four major U.S. wireless carriers have been sweetening their unlimited plan offers, prompting concerns from industry analysts about an accelerating price war. But Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, said the promotion  makes a really big splash in a really small pool,  noting that it primarily applied to Verizon users because of the phones that are eligible.

Algeria has joined with North African neighbor Tunisia to seek support for an inclusive dialogue in Libya, where competing governments and armed supporters have struggled for control since a 2011 civil war ousted veteran leader Muammar Gaddafi.  France aims to play a bigger role in bringing Libya's factions together to end the turmoil that has allowed Islamist militants to gain a foothold and migrant smugglers to flourish in the absence of a strong central government.  The main objective remains the fight against terrorism in this area of turbulence, where the presence of terrorists is reinforced because of the chaotic situation in Libya,  Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel said after talks with France's Jean-Yves Le Drian, according to state news agency APS. Le Drian, on a two-day visit to Algiers, described his talks with Messahel as  thorough . French officials fear Islamic State militants - who were driven from the coastal city of Sirte last year - and other jihadists are trying to exploit the power vacuum in Libya to regroup after losing substantial ground in Syria and Iraq.  A U.N.-backed Libyan government of national accord has sat in Tripoli for more than a year, but it has struggled to reach agreement with eastern factions, including with powerful commander Khalifa Haftar. Libya's neighbors and regional powers have often differed on how to help. Egypt is closer to Haftar and his anti-Islamist militant campaign while Algeria has pushed for an inclusive approach including using the influence of Tunisia's moderate Islamists. Last week Le Drian last week held talks with Egypt on how to stabilize Libya and on Monday began a two-day visit to Algiers, where he said he had  thorough  talks with his Algerian counterpart Abdelkader Messahel. Last year Islamic State was driven out of the Libyan coastal city of Sirte.   It is this determination which leads us to wish for a political solution in Libya,  APS quoted Le Drian as saying. Algeria and France have agreed to  combine their efforts to reach an inclusive political solution that allows the integrity of Libyan territory and a peace process , Le Drian added. Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt last week expressed support for dialogue in Libya and rejected foreign interference or any military options, days after Egyptian jets carried out strikes against militant camps inside Libya. The talks between Le Drian and Messahel also included the situation in the Sahel, two years after Algeria helped mediate a peace deal in Mali between the government and Tuareg rebels, in part to help stop Islamist militants gaining ground.

After three months of inflation above 2 percent driven by cuts to utility subsidies like electricity and home-heating natural gas, consumer prices rose 1.3 percent in May, below expectations and half the 2.6 percent increase in April. Twelve-month inflation fell to 24 percent. But in a central bank survey published earlier this month, economists' expectations for inflation rose to 21.6 percent in 2017 and 15 percent in 2018, above the monetary authority's target ranges of 12 to 17 percent and 8 to 12 percent for 2017 and 2018, respectively. Without further increases in utilities prices expected until later this year, economists expect inflation to cool in the coming months.  The estimates and state and private high-frequency indicators monitored by the central bank suggest that in June the economy continues the disinflation process that returned in May,  the central bank said in a statement.

The parties agreed on Tuesday to form a so-called  Jamaica coalition  - a reference to the black, yellow and green colors of the Jamaican flag - and will put it in writing on Wednesday, according to the sources. Pollsters say Merkel, who is seeking a fourth term in office, may be able to forge a similar three-way coalition on the federal level after elections in September, ending her party's current link with the center-left Social Democrats. Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) scored a decisive victory in Schleswig-Holstein in May, ousting the previous three-way governing coalition led by SPD and including the Greens and the South Schleswig Party (SSW), which represents the Danish minority. A spokesman for the FDP confirmed that an agreement had been reached, but gave no details. Merkel's CDU is also close to an agreement to govern with the FDP in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, after a surprise win for the CDU in that state on May 14, the head of the FDP, Christian Lindner, told Reuters.

A person close to the legal team said on Friday Trump's chief personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, expected to file a complaint against Comey early this week to the Justice Department's inspector general's office. “I think it’s going to take a little longer,” Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the legal team, said on Tuesday. “It may well slip to next week.” Corallo also said the complaint may be filed to the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility rather than its Office of Inspector General. Trump's lawyers are sifting through additional information and preparing at least one submission, and a meeting scheduled for Wednesday may clarify the proper avenue for the complaint, he said. The president has responded to Comey's testimony on Thursday to the Senate Intelligence Committee by denying that he tried to interfere with an FBI investigation, and calling the former FBI chief a leaker. In his testimony, Comey said that after Trump fired him last month he gave a memo he wrote about a meeting with the president to a friend in order to have its contents disclosed to the media. In a statement following the testimony, Kasowitz accused Comey of leaking  privileged  information. Some legal experts have said the information disclosed was not privileged because Trump himself had already publicly discussed their conversations. A former high-ranking Justice Department official familiar with how the inspector general handles complaints said any filing by Kasowitz would most likely be treated as part of an existing investigation into Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. “This could end up as a footnote in a longer report,” the former official said. Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said he believes the Comey disclosure violated FBI regulations but said the Office of Professional Responsibility may be reluctant to look into an disciplinary allegation against a former rather than current employee.   The challenge for the Trump team is to find an office that will get to the merits,  said Turley. John Lavinsky, a spokesman for the Inspector General, declined to comment.

Big tech names, such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Facebook (FB.O), pushed the S&P; 500 higher.  I think the fall the last two days has been due to psychology not to any fundamentals, and today you’re seeing some people step back in and buy again,  said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Fundamentals look good.  Tech has led the benchmark S&P; 500's 9-percent rally this year, and its recent swoon has sparked speculation that investors may be rotating into other swaths of the market that have lagged in 2017, such as financials and energy. Financials .SPSY gained 0.4 percent on Tuesday, while energy .SPSY gained 0.7 percent. Materials .SPLRCM were the top gaining sector, rising 1.3 percent. Tuesday's market action reflected  a continuation of running up some of the areas that have not participated over the course of the last few months, in combination with some speculation that the Fed is going to be more resolute about raising rates than investors had begun to anticipate in the bond market,  said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland.

Last month American said it would shrink the distance between some seat backs, or pitch, on its new Boeing Co 737 MAX jets from the minimum of 31 inches on its current 737-800 fleet, to 29 inches. The backlash was swift at a time when relations between U.S. airlines and their passengers have sunk to a new low. In an internal email reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday, the company said it had  received a lot of feedback from both customers and team members  and said it had decided to space all main cabin rows with at least 30 inches of pitch. The company said  airline customers feel increasingly frustrated by their experiences and less valued when they fly. We can be leaders in helping to turn around that perception, and that includes reviewing decisions that have significant impact on the flying experience.  American Airlines aircraft are parked at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, U.S., August 8, 2016.Joshua Roberts/File PhotoDoug Kidd, executive director of the National Association of Airline Passengers, said American’s decision “is a move in the right direction” but added airlines should do more and charge more if needed.  It's those last few inches that make the difference,  he said. The MAX will still be configured with 172 seats, up from 160 on the current 737-800s, but the airline will add the space by switching one row of premium seats to main cabin seating, the email said. American, which plans to start taking delivery of the MAX in the fall, said the new seat is designed to  feel more spacious so a 30 inch pitch will feel more like today’s 31 inches.  The change may be made to other American aircraft. United Airlines President Scott Kirby said in May at a congressional hearing the airline had not made a  final decision  about whether to cut pitch to 29 inches in some seats. Nearly all United seats currently have at least 31 inches of pitch. At the congressional hearing in May, airline executives faced  scathing criticism for their customer service, after the furor surrounding a passenger being dragged from a full United Airlines plane to make room for airline employees.

Analyst Natalia Corfield wrote in a client note that a still sluggish economy and weaker prospects for a proposed pension reform could delay efforts to bolster loan book quality. Lenders have wrestled with record provisions since Brazil slumped into a deep recession almost three years ago. Late last month, meatpacker JBS SA's (JBSS3.SA) controlling shareholder J&F; Investimentos agreed to pay a record-setting 10.3 billion real ($3.2 billion) fine for its role in a corruption scandal that seemed to implicate Brazilian President Michel Temer. Shares of Brazil's largest banks have dropped an average of 13 percent since mid-May, when allegations first surfaced that Temer had endorsed the payment of hush money to silence a potential witness and took bribes from JBS. Temer has denied the allegations. Lenders could suffer from their exposure to other companies facing hefty fines as part of a fresh wave of expected plea bargains and leniency deals, some investors fear.  Despite the mitigating factors, we maintain our view that expected asset quality improvements have become less likely given the recent political crisis,  New York-based Corfield said in the note. Banking sector officials, by contrast, have argued that the events leading to the J&F; plea deal are unlikely to pose any serious risk for the nation's banking system. Some Brazilian banks have held preliminary consultations with prosecutors over how plea deals work, the online service of Valor Econômico newspaper reported on Tuesday. The report did not disclose the names of the banks due to concerns about how investors would react to the news, ValorPRO said, citing a person familiar with the matter. A spokeswoman for the prosecutor-general's office declined to comment.     A presidential decree announced last week would allow Brazil's central bank to strike plea-bargain agreements with lenders that admit breaching the law in exchange for softer fines or more lenient prison terms for their executives.

State-controlled Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3.SA) rose 1.1 percent, while units of Banco Santander Brasil SA (SANB11.SA) dropped 0.1 percent. The government may have to amend parts of the decree to include prosecutors in the structuring of plea deals along with the central bank and the securities industry watchdog, Valor said. According to Corfield, one aspect of concern is the banking industry's exposure to meatpackers including JBS. Overall, JBS and J&F; appear to pose the largest risk to Brazil's banking system, the note said. Together they account for about two-thirds of estimated bank loans to the protein sector.

Most of that comes from JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, the note said.

(Reuters) - The Golden State Warriors made a strong case to be called one of the best teams in NBA history after a near-perfect run through the playoffs resulted in their second title in three years. The scary part for the NBA's 29 other team s? This may just be the beginning. That is because the Warriors boast an intimidating starting lineup featuring four All-Stars in their 20s who are likely to be with the team for years to come. Two-time reigning league MVP Stephen Curry is expected to sign the richest contract in NBA history this offseason as the league's best three-point marksman will be eligible for a five-year deal worth an estimated $207 million.  I'm just excited to do something special,  Curry said during the presentation of the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy on Monday in Oakland after his team beat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals.  I'm ready to do it again.  If so he will have help from shooting guard Klay Thompson and do-it-all power forward Draymond Green, who are already locked into long-term contracts with the Warriors. And then there is Kevin Durant. The 7-foot (2.13 m) small forward and 2017 Finals MVP has said that after his controversial decision leave the Oklahoma City Thunder and join the Warriors last offseason, he is not eager to move again. Durant is so dedicated to winning multiple championships that he is reportedly considering taking less money from the team in order to free up space to re-sign key reserves like Shaun Livingston and Andre Iguodala. That all spells trouble for the rest of the league, who saw the Warriors capture a title in 2015, win a record-setting 73 games the next regular season before Durant moved to the Bay Area and the team became a juggernaut.  They're going to be around for a while,  Cavaliers forward LeBron James said after suffering his second Finals defeat in three years to a Warriors team that went 16-1 in the playoffs.  Pretty much all their big-name guys are in their 20s, and they don't show any signs of slowing down.  And the team's coaching staff is equally formidable. After being sidelined for part of last season and again during the 2017 playoffs with back pain, head coach Steve Kerr returned during the Finals and said he intends to coach  for a long time.  General Manager Bob Myers, who helped assemble the Warriors lineup after the franchise spent years as the league's laughing stock, and savvy owner Joe Lacob fill out the rest of the team.  The big question this offseason is what, if anything, will contenders like Cleveland, San Antonio and Boston do to counter the champion Warriors. Some reports have suggested James, the best player on the planet, may head to California to join the Lakers or Clippers in 2018, likely bringing talented players along in an effort to topple the Warriors if the Cavaliers fall short again next year. One thing is clear - if no one can assemble a truly special team, the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy could very well reside in the Bay Area for years to come.  After the parade, the narrative will shift to 'So, what does the league plan to do about this?'  wrote Ray Ratto, a veteran Bay Area sports columnist.  Right now, the only answer seems to be 'not a damned thing.' Because that's the only answer that makes sense. This is Golden State's era.

This new arrangement is very unsettling, and people are concerned and wary of what it may mean, and what promises will be given, or promises extracted from Theresa May,  said Michelle Gildernew, a lawmaker for Sinn Fein.  There is a lot of anxiety and a lot of fear out of what is being discussed.  Former Prime Minister John Major said earlier that a Conservative-DUP deal could create the perception that London was no longer an honest broker of the 1998 peace settlement in Northern Ireland, known as the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP said it was discussing issues to do with Brexit and economic matters in its talks with the Conservatives. However, there are other issues that could be discussed that Sinn Fein would object to, including any change in the treatment of British soldiers accused of crimes during Northern Ireland's conflict, in which 3,600 people were killed. Concessions on such issues could seriously damage efforts by the DUP to secure a deal with Sinn Fein to restore Northern Ireland's devolved government, which collapsed in January. Sinn Fein said that it was important there was transparency over any deal between the Conservatives and the DUP, and that compromises over certain policy areas could hinder efforts to form a new Northern Irish executive.    The form of the DUP in the past in the past, and the type of policies that they have put forward, the type of policies that they have pursued with the Tories in the past, are very very concerning,  Pearse Doherty, a Sinn Fein lawmaker in the Irish parliament, said.   It does cause serious strain in relation to the potential of getting an executive up and running, if we have that type of relationship.

In other words, we need the 'softest' exit consistent with actually leaving and controlling laws, money, borders and trade,  he said.  Since last year's vote to leave the EU, Baker has played an influential role in organizing a group of eurosceptic lawmakers within May's Conservative Party in opposition to any attempt to water down the terms of Britain's departure. Earlier this year, Baker said in an article posted on his website that Britain must seek a new and independent partnership with the EU, rejecting any kind of  associate membership, or anything that leaves us half-in, half-out.   The Liberal Democrats, a party that has consistently opposed Brexit, said Baker's appointment  flies in the face of last week's election in which the British people clearly rejected May's extreme version of Brexit .  Far from softening her stance on Brexit, Theresa May is doubling down by appointing an arch Brexiteer to help lead the negotiations,  said Liberal Democrat lawmaker Alistair Carmichael.

After losing her parliamentary majority in a botched gamble on a snap election, May is so weakened that her Brexit strategy has become the subject of public debate inside her own party, with calls for her to take a more business-friendly approach. Seeking to avoid a second election that could deepen Britain's worst political turmoil since last June's shock vote to leave the EU, May edged closer to a deal to win the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). She held talks with DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose eurosceptic Northern Irish party has 10 parliamentary seats and could shore up May's minority Conservative government.  What we're doing in relation to the talks that we're holding, the productive talks we're holding with the Democratic Unionist Party, is ensuring that it is possible to, with their support, give the stability to the UK government that I think is necessary at this time,  May told a news conference in Paris following a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. Earlier, Foster said the talks were going well:  We hope soon to be able to bring this work to a successful conclusion.  May made clear the Brexit negotiations would begin on schedule despite the political uncertainty at home.  I confirmed to President Macron that the timetable for the Brexit negotiation remains on course and will begin next week,  May said after her meeting with the new French leader, who will be a key player in the Brexit talks.   I think there is a unity of purpose among people in the United Kingdom. It's a unity of purpose, having voted to leave the EU, that their government gets on with that and makes a success of it.  During the election campaign, May cast herself as the only leader competent to navigate the tortuous Brexit negotiations that will shape the future of the United Kingdom and its $2.5 trillion economy. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, which saw its number of parliamentary seats and share of the vote increase, said there could be another election this year or early in 2018 after last Thursday's vote produced no clear winner. Destabilizing Risk Related CoverageBritain's Hammond to push for UK to stay in EU customs union: The Times'Anxiety and fear' in Northern Ireland over Conservative-DUP talks: Sinn FeinUK ex-PM David Cameron says May should consult rivals on Brexit: FTThe BBC reported that a deal with the DUP was expected to be signed on Wednesday. That would give May enough votes to pass her legislative agenda through parliament and govern, albeit with a wafer-thin majority. But a deal with the DUP also risks destabilizing Northern Ireland by increasing the influence of pro-British unionists. They have struggled for years with Irish Catholic nationalists, who want the British province to join a united Ireland. Former British prime minister John Major said he was concerned May's plan to govern with the support of the DUP could pitch the province back into turmoil by persuading 'hard men' on both sides of the divide to return to violence.  The last thing anybody wishes to see is one or other of the communities so aggrieved that the hard men, who are still there lurking in the corners of the communities, decide that they wish to return to some form of violence,  Major told BBC radio.  I am concerned about the deal. I am wary about it. I am dubious about it,  Major said. Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein said the prospect of a British agreement with the DUP was causing anxiety and fear.  Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May, leaves 10 Downing Street in central London, Britain June 13, 2017.Phil NobleWhile the DUP are deeply eurosceptic, they have balked at some of the practical implications of a so-called hard Brexit -- including a potential loss of a  frictionless border  with the Republic of Ireland -- and talks will touch on efforts to minimize the potential damage to Northern Ireland. Brexit Civil War? May, who ahead of last June's referendum supported remaining in the EU, promised to start the Brexit talks next week, but opponents of a sharp break with the EU took her woes as a chance to push back against her strategy. Before the election, May proposed a clean break from the EU, involving withdrawal from Europe's single market, limits on immigration and a bespoke customs deal with the EU. Brexit minister David Davis has insisted the approach to the EU divorce has not changed, but at the meeting with lawmakers on Monday, May recognized that a broader consensus needed to be built for Brexit and made clear she would listen to all wings of the party on the issue. She will have to manage conflicting demands from within her own party, including a proposal for business groups and lawmakers from all parties to agree a national position for Britain's most complex negotiations since World War Two.  Slideshow (4 Images)May faces a difficult balancing act: Divisions over Europe helped sink the premierships of Margaret Thatcher, Major and David Cameron, and many of her lawmakers and party membership support a sharp break with the EU.    The Tory civil war on the EU which has ripped it apart since the Maastricht rebellions of the early 1990s, and which the referendum was supposed to solve, is now raging again,  said Chris Grey, an academic who specializes in Brexit at Royal Holloway college in London.  Good Clean Brexit  Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the government should put economic growth at the heart of its Brexit  strategy, comments placing her in the camp of those advocating a closer trade relationship with the EU, or  soft  Brexit. May appointed Steve Baker, a prominent Brexit campaigner, to the Department for Exiting the EU.  We need a good, clean exit which minimizes disruption and maximizes opportunity,  Baker said just hours before his appointment.  The performance of the British economy could also influence perceptions of Brexit. Government bond prices were on track for their heaviest one-day losses since January after consumer price inflation jumped to 2.9 percent in May. As European leaders tried to fathom exactly how Britain would begin the negotiations, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he wanted a Brexit deal that would limit negative consequences for the bloc but nor did it want to weaken Britain.  We want a solution that causes as little damage as possible for both sides,  Schaeuble said, adding that he expected London to remain an important financial center for Europe. The veteran conservative predicted that Britain would regret its departure from the bloc at some point in the future.   And then they'll come back. But it remains another question if I'll still witness this,  added the 74-year-old. Asked about Schaeuble's comments, Macron said the EU's door was still open for Britain as long as the negotiations were not finished, but that it would be difficult to reverse course.

The helium plants operated by RasGas, a subsidiary of state-owned Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] (QP), were shut after Saudi Arabia closed its border with Qatar, blocking overland exports of the gas, a QP official told Reuters. RasGas is 70 percent owned by QP and U.S. giant Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) has 30 percent.  The official declined to be named under briefing rules. Phil Kornbluth, head of U.S.-based industry consultancy Kornbluth Helium Consulting, said his sources had confirmed the closure. The closure of the plants is a sign of how the rift between Qatar and Arab powers could affect commodities markets. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport ties last week, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism, a charge Doha denies.  Qatar's exports of liquefied natural gas at Ras Laffan have been unaffected by the boycott. The impact on the global helium market was expected to be delayed, as consumers use up existing stocks and work out alternative supply options. Shipping by sea directly from Doha or through Oman would add complexity, risk and cost. But if the diplomatic dispute lasts a month or more, Kornbluth predicted there would be a global shortage and the last time that happened, prices doubled.  Helium is the single commodity that is affected most by this blockade because it's probably the only thing where Qatar is a major world producer and the supply has been completely cut off,  he said. Among its uses, helium is used to cool superconducting magnets in medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, as a lifting gas in balloons and airships, as a gas to breathe in deep-sea diving and to keep satellite instruments cool. It is derived from natural gas during processing. The two plants shut by Qatar have a combined annual production capacity of approximately 2 billion standard cubic feet of liquid helium and can meet about 25 percent of total world demand for the gas, according to RasGas' website. Kornbluth said the helium plants had shut down after filling all available shipping containers and storage tanks. He forecast the closure was costing RasGas revenue. Finding New Supplies Helium, best known as a gas for filling party balloons and making the voice squeaky, is difficult to capture and store. The United States is the biggest producer in what is a $4.7 billion industry, according to Mordor Intelligence. Demand for the gas, driven particularly by Asia's booming manufacturing industry, is on the rise. U.S. reserves meanwhile are dwindling due to the lack of helium production from its oil and gas fields, and the country has already had to start importing helium from Qatar. Other helium-producing countries include Algeria, Russia, Canada and China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A Dubai-based vendor servicing the local market said on Tuesday it had not received new shipments from Qatar since last week, forcing it to dip into its stocks. Japan's Iwatani (8088.T), which supplies helium to China and Southeast Asia, said it had a month's supply in stock. A spokesman told Reuters it was considering exporting on ships from a Qatari port, or sourcing from the United States. German industrial gases company Linde (LING.DE) said it was working on meeting customers' requirements via helium sources in Australia, Algeria and the United States. Air Water (4088.T), which imports from Qatar and sells in Japan, has shifted its helium supply automatically to the United States, a spokesman said. A source with direct knowledge of the matter said South Korea's importers, which source a third of their helium from Qatar, could suffer heavily.  We might have an indirect impact if U.S. helium prices go up,  the source said. Editing by David Clarke","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-helium-idUSKBN19426X"},

Confirmation of the outbreaks in Congo's Haut-Lomami and Maniema provinces came less than a week after the WHO said polio had resurfaced in Syria, in an area partly controlled by Islamic State.  WHO assesses the risk of further national spread of these strains to be high, and the risk of international spread to be medium,  the WHO, the U.N. health agency, said in a disease outbreak report. Like the Syrian outbreak, the four Congolese cases were caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2, which emerges in areas with only patchy vaccine coverage after being excreted by people who have been vaccinated. In 1988, the goal of eradicating the disease globally was set for the year 2000, but it has been repeatedly pushed back, with billions of dollars spent on trying to snuff out the last remaining pockets of disease. The new head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, welcomed $1.2 billion of new funding for the battle against polio, made at the Rotary Convention in Atlanta, the WHO said.   It is humbling to see again the power of this incredible global partnership to generate funding to fight one of the world’s most horrible and debilitating diseases,  Tedros said in a WHO statement.  We must finish the job properly to ensure that there is no chance of this terrible disease coming back.  Thirty years ago, polio paralyzed more than 350,000 children each year in more than 125 countries around the world, the statement said. Since then, incidence of the disease has been reduced by more than 99.9 percent, it said. Polio invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours. It spreads rapidly among children. If transmission can be ended, it would be only the second human disease to be eradicated since smallpox was banished in 1980.

Confirmation of the outbreaks in Congo's Haut-Lomami and Maniema provinces came less than a week after the WHO said polio had resurfaced in Syria, in an area partly controlled by Islamic State.  WHO assesses the risk of further national spread of these strains to be high, and the risk of international spread to be medium,  the WHO, the U.N. health agency, said in a disease outbreak report. Like the Syrian outbreak, the four Congolese cases were caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2, which emerges in areas with only patchy vaccine coverage after being excreted by people who have been vaccinated. In 1988, the goal of eradicating the disease globally was set for the year 2000, but it has been repeatedly pushed back, with billions of dollars spent on trying to snuff out the last remaining pockets of disease. The new head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, welcomed $1.2 billion of new funding for the battle against polio, made at the Rotary Convention in Atlanta, the WHO said.   It is humbling to see again the power of this incredible global partnership to generate funding to fight one of the world’s most horrible and debilitating diseases,  Tedros said in a WHO statement.  We must finish the job properly to ensure that there is no chance of this terrible disease coming back.  Thirty years ago, polio paralyzed more than 350,000 children each year in more than 125 countries around the world, the statement said. Since then, incidence of the disease has been reduced by more than 99.9 percent, it said. Polio invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours. It spreads rapidly among children. If transmission can be ended, it would be only the second human disease to be eradicated since smallpox was banished in 1980.

The EU leaders will convene in Brussels on June 22-23, in the same week that long-awaited talks on Britain's exit from the bloc are due to begin in the biggest setback for European integration in six decades. Determined to show that an EU of 27 - minus Britain - can still thrive, the bloc is pushing for closer defense ties, something London has long opposed.  The joint development of capability projects commonly agreed by Member States to fill the existing major shortfalls and develop the technologies of the future is key to fulfilling the EU level of ambition,  the document reads.  It gives top EU backing to the already-proposed joint financing for research and development in Europe's fractured defense industry, and pushes for working out financing details for the bloc's joint battle groups that have never been used.  France and Germany revived talk of the EU's long-stalled efforts at expanding military cooperation following the Brexit referendum a year ago.   It must be our goal to develop common, pan-European capabilities,  German Chancellor Angela Merkel told fellow conservatives on Tuesday, adding that she and French President Emmanuel Macron had agreed to work together more closely to strengthen defense and security. Merkel said trans-Atlantic ties would remain critically important, but the EU needed to expand its ability to deal with regional conflicts and protect its external borders.  We simply have to take on more responsibility,  she said. U.S. President Donald Trump's uneasy relationship with Europe and lukewarm stance on NATO have given the tentative push for more defense cooperation greater momentum.   Fair  Trade The draft conclusions mirrored much of the language favoring open markets previously seen from EU leaders, though with a greater emphasis now on  fair  as well as  free  trade. The document said the EU saw merit in seeking further steps to create stronger trade defenses and screen foreign investments. France, Germany and Italy have mooted the idea of allowing the EU to block Chinese investment in Europe, partly because European companies are denied similar access in China and because of risks that Beijing may acquire prized European technology. An EU-China summit earlier this month was overshadowed by divisions on trade.  The leaders will encourage progress in free trade talks with Mexico and the Mercosur bloc of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay and say recent progress in negotiations with Japan  paves the way for an early political agreement . Despite Trump's announcement that he was pulling the United States out of the global accord on climate change, EU leaders are due to express their full backing for the accord.  The European Council strongly reaffirms the EU commitment to swiftly and fully implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change,  they will say.  The Agreement remains a cornerstone for global efforts to effectively tackle climate change, and cannot be renegotiated.

","sector":"Markets","content":"WASHINGTON, June 13 (Reuters) - The United States appears poised to heighten scrutiny of Chinese investment in Silicon Valley to better shield sensitive technologies seen as vital to U.S. national security, current and former U.S. officials tell Reuters. Of particular concern is China's interest in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, which have increasingly attracted Chinese capital in recent years. The worry is that cutting-edge technologies developed in the United States could be used by China to bolster its military capabilities and perhaps even push it ahead in strategic industries. The U.S. government is now looking to strengthen the role of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the inter-agency committee that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national security grounds. An unreleased Pentagon report, viewed by Reuters, warns that China is skirting U.S. oversight and gaining access to sensitive technology through transactions that currently don't trigger CFIUS review. Such deals would include joint ventures, minority stakes and early-stage investments in start-ups.  We're examining CFIUS to look at the long-term health and security of the U.S. economy, given China's predatory practices  in technology, said a Trump administration official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis weighed into the debate on Tuesday, calling CFIUS  outdated  and telling a Senate hearing:  It needs to be updated to deal with today's situation.  CFIUS is headed by the Treasury Department and includes nine permanent members including representatives from the departments of Defense, Justice, Homeland Security, Commerce, State and Energy. The CFIUS panel is so secretive it normally does not comment after it makes a decision on a deal. Under former President Barack Obama, CFIUS stopped a series of attempted Chinese acquisitions of high-end chip makers. Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is now drafting legislation that would give CFIUS far more power to block some technology investments, a Cornyn aide said.  Artificial intelligence is one of many leading-edge technologies that China seeks and that has potential military applications,  said the Cornyn aide, who declined to be identified.  These technologies are so new that our export control system has not yet figured out how to cover them, which is part of the reason they are slipping through the gaps in the existing safeguards,  the aide said. The legislation would require CFIUS to heighten scrutiny of buyers hailing from nations identified as potential threats to national security. CFIUS would maintain the list, the aide said, without specifying who would create it. Cornyn's legislation would not single out specific technologies that would be subject to CFIUS scrutiny. But it would provide a mechanism for the Pentagon to lead that identification effort, with input from the U.S. technology sector, the Commerce Department, and the Energy Department, the aide said. James Lewis, an expert on military technology at the Center for Security and International Studies, said the U.S. government is playing catch-up.  The Chinese have found a way around our protections, our safeguards, on technology transfer in foreign investment. And they're using it to pull ahead of us, both economically and militarily,  Lewis said.  I think that's a big deal.  But some industry experts warn that stronger U.S. regulations may not succeed in halting technology transfer and might trigger retaliation by China, with economic repercussions for the United States. China made the United States the top destination for its foreign direct investment in 2016, with $45.6 billion in completed acquisitions and greenfield investments, according to the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Investment from January to May 2017 totaled $22 billion, which represented a 100 percent increase against the same period last year, it said.  There will be a significant pushback from the technology industry  if legislation is overly aggressive, Rhodium Group economist Thilo Hanemann said. Ai's Role in Drone Warfare Concerns about Chinese inroads into advanced technology come as the U.S. military looks to incorporate elements of artificial intelligence and machine learning into its drone program. Project Maven, as the effort is known, aims to provide some relief to military analysts who are part of the war against Islamic State. These analysts currently spend long hours staring at big screens reviewing video feeds from drones as part of the hunt for insurgents in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. The Pentagon is trying to develop algorithms that would sort through the material and alert analysts to important finds, according to Air Force Lieutenant General John N.T.  Jack  Shanahan, director for defense intelligence for warfighting support.  A lot of times these things are flying around(and)... there's nothing in the scene that's of interest,  he told Reuters. Shanahan said his team is currently trying to teach the system to recognize objects such as trucks and buildings, identify people and, eventually, detect changes in patterns of daily life that could signal significant developments.  We'll start small, show some wins,  he said. A Pentagon official said the U.S. government is requesting to spend around $30 million on the effort in 2018. Similar image recognition technology is being developed commercially by firms in Silicon Valley, which could be adapted by adversaries for military reasons. Shanahan said he' not surprised that Chinese firms are making investments there.  They know what they're targeting,  he said. Research firm CB Insights says it has tracked 29 investors from mainland China investing in U.S. artificial intelligence companies since the start of 2012. The risks extend beyond technology transfer.  When the Chinese make an investment in an early stage company developing advanced technology, there is an opportunity cost to the U.S. since that company is potentially off-limits for purposes of working with (the Department of Defense),  the report said. Chinese Investment China has made no secret of its ambition to become a major player in artificial intelligence, including through foreign acquisitions. Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc launched an AI lab in March with China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission. In just one recent example, Baidu Inc agreed in April to acquire U.S. computer vision firm xPerception, which makes vision perception software and hardware with applications in robotics and virtual reality.  China is investing massively in this space,  said Peter Singer, an expert on robotic warfare at the New America Foundation. The draft Pentagon report cautioned that one of the factors hindering U.S. government regulation is that many Chinese investments fall short of outright acquisitions that can trigger a CFIUS review. Export controls were not designed to govern early-stage technology. It recommended that the Pentagon develop a critical technologies list and restrict Chinese investments on that list. It also proposed enhancing counterintelligence efforts. The report also signaled the need for measures that fall beyond the scope of the U.S. military. Those include altering immigration policy to allow Chinese graduate students the ability to stay in the United States after completing their studies, instead of taking their know-how back to China. Venky Ganesan, managing director at Menlo Futures, concurs about the need to keep the best and brightest in the United States.  The single biggest thing we can do is staple a green card to their diploma so that they stay here and build the technologies here – not go back to their countries and compete against us,  Ganesan said.

Senate staff who manage press access told television network reporters earlier Tuesday that they could no longer film interviews with senators in the hallways of the Capitol without first receiving permission, citing a directive from the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.  Such interviews, an everyday occurrence in designated areas throughout the Capitol, provide a running insight into legislators' thoughts on bills and hearings. The staff said the restrictions were because the number of reporters has swelled due to negotiations on healthcare legislation and high-profile hearings. The directive came from the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees operations on the Senate side of the Capitol, they said. The panel is controlled by Republicans, since they hold the majority in the Senate. Committee Chairman Richard Shelby said in a statement the panel was simply enforcing rules already on the books, adding it  has been working with the various galleries to ensure compliance with existing rules in an effort to help provide a safe environment.   The senior Democrat on the panel, Amy Klobuchar, said she was not consulted in advance and objected. In a statement, Klobuchar said she called on Republicans  to allow reporters to do their jobs.  She added that she had talked to Shelby, who had told her he would not move to change press access without consulting her.  We must hold him to it. This is no time for limiting press access in the U.S. Senate — with Russia hearings, Attorney General (Jeff) Sessions testifying, and what appears to be the secretive drafting of a healthcare bill. We have to preserve freedom of the press,” she said. Shelby's office did not respond to a request to discuss the dispute over media access except to provide his prepared statement. A Senate aide, who asked not to be identified, said that  Rules Committee members were  looking to make changes and have backed off for now.   We're certainly not trying to deny anybody an opportunity to have questions asked,  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said during a press conference, referring reporters back to the Rules Committee for detailed guidance. The Capitol hallways have been crowded with both reporters and summer tourists in recent weeks as Senate Republicans work on an overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system. Current and former government officials have also drawn crowds at hearings related to probes into alleged Russian meddling in last year's presidential election.

(Reuters) - Kevin Durant was criticized by many for joining an already-stacked Golden State Warriors team last July but it is hard to question the move after watching how seamlessly he fit in with the NBA's newest super team. Durant was named the Most Valuable Player of the NBA Finals on Monday after claiming an elusive NBA championship over the Cleveland Cavaliers.  I remember the first day of camp and I walk into camp, and I didn't know what to expect, I didn't know what these guys were like on the court,  Durant told reporters after the game.  I just wanted to come in there and just be me. And I did that from day one, and I just tried to stay with that.  To win his first championship Durant had to go through the game's greatest player in Cavaliers forward LeBron James, who he defended for most of the five games.  Experience is the best teacher in life, and he's just experiencing and experiencing and experiencing,  said James.  He felt like he needed to reassemble and reassess his career and come here.  Durant was once again the best player on the floor for the Warriors on Monday, hitting some timely three-pointers en route to a team-high 39 points. Durant ripped out the hearts of Oklahoma City Thunder fans last year by leaving for the Oakland-based Warriors, which many considered the easiest route to an NBA title. At the time, Durant called the leadup to his decision the most challenging few weeks of his NBA career, and even said it was not about winning titles but about personal growth and quality-of-life choices. Regardless, the decision by one of the game's greatest players shook the NBA landscape and created a super team that became overnight villains given their sheer depth of top talent. It also created lofty expectations for Durant, with many onlookers saying his move would be a failure if the Warriors did not go on to win a title in their first season together. Durant did indeed join a ready-made contender by teaming up with two-time reigning league MVP Stephen Curry on a team that won it all in 2015 and were runners-up last year after a season   in which they had a record 73 wins in 82 games. But assembling great players has never been a guarantee of instant success as too many star players can sometimes create issues with how the ball should get distributed. None of that was an issue for the Warriors as Durant has been called an unselfish player whose only desire was to do whatever is in the best interests of his team. Durant was already one of the greatest players in NBA history before his move to the Warriors after collecting the scoring title four times and picking up MVPs honors in 2014. But he offered a glimpse of what more he could offer by averaging more than 30 points per game during a 4-1 series win over the Cavaliers in the Finals.

The Labor Department said prices for services rose 0.3 percent in May, driven by a 1.1 percent surge in the index for final demand trade services, which measures changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers.     U.S. three-year Treasury yields hit 1.511 percent, their highest since May 16, while two-year yields   touched their highest in a month of 1.367 percent.      Yields eased from their session highs and were last roughly unchanged from their levels as of late Monday, with three- and two-year yields last at 1.503 percent and 1.363 percent, respectively.      Traders likely viewed more costly services as a harbinger of stronger May consumer price index data, which is set for release on Wednesday, said John Herrmann, director of interest rates strategy at MUFG Securities in New York.     That potential inflation pickup would follow recent readings showing inflation moving away from the Fed's 2 percent goal.      The Fed is scheduled to announce its decision on interest rates at 2 p.m ET (1800 GMT) on Wednesday at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. The Fed is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate for the second time this year.      Herrmann of MUFG also said yields were pressured a bit higher given the risk that the Fed could provide more detail on its plans to shrink its bond portfolio. Short-dated Treasuries in particular are considered most vulnerable to Fed rate increases.       The markets have to build in a little bit of risk that the Fed may say something about tapering tomorrow,  he said.     The U.S. Treasury sold $12 billion of 30-year government bonds at a yield of 2.870 percent, which was the lowest at an auction of this debt maturity since October, Treasury data showed.     U.S. 30-year yields were last at 2.863 percent, compared to 2.868 percent late Monday. Long-dated yields earlier hit 2.886 percent, their highest since June 1.       The bond auction coming in fairly well today probably helped anchor prices,  said John Briggs, head of strategy for the Americas at NatWest Markets.  But tomorrow is the big day, so we’re just kind of moving back to unchanged.      Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were last at 2.209 percent, compared to 2.213 percent late Monday.

The Senate voted 53 to 47 to narrowly defeat legislation that sought to block portions of a new, separate arms sale to Saudi Arabia, agreed during a visit there by President Donald Trump in May. Arms sales to Riyadh have become increasingly contentious in the U.S. Congress, where some lawmakers object that American weapons have contributed to widespread civilian casualties in a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. Republican Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, a Democrat,  suspended the planned sale of precision-guided munitions in December because of concerns over civilian casualties in Yemen, where the civil war pits Iran-allied Houthi rebels against the government backed by a Saudi-led Arab coalition. Trump, however, has said he wants to encourage weapons sales as a way to create jobs in the United States.  Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration had notified Congress about the start of deliveries on the 2015 sale. He said in a statement that Trump's decision was another reason for the Senate to disapprove the new sale.  We need to send a message to both the Trump Administration and the Saudis to work much harder to avoid civilian casualties, expedite humanitarian relief, and push for a peaceful end to the war through a negotiated political settlement,  Cardin said. Republicans control both chambers of Congress. A senior congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the notification was received last Thursday. The decision to move ahead with deliveries was first reported by Bloomberg. The 2015 sale included more than 8,000 Laser Guided Bombs for the Royal Saudi Air Force. The package also includes more than 10,000 general purpose bombs, and more than 5,000 tail kits used to inexpensively convert  dumb  bombs into laser or GPS-guided weapons. Some of the weapons systems included in the sale were made by Raytheon Co and Boeing Co.  The arms deal announced in May was for $110 billion, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. Tuesday's Senate vote, which would block about $500 million of that sale, including precision-guided munitions and other offensive weapons, coincides with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other officials in Washington.

Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela said in a televised address on Monday that Panama was upgrading its commercial ties with China and establishing full diplomatic links with the second most important customer of its key shipping canal.  I'm convinced that this is the correct path for our country,  Varela said. Taiwan's government said it was sorry and angry over Panama's decision, and it would not compete with China in what it described as a  diplomatic money game .  Our government expresses serious objections and strong condemnation in response to China enticing Panama to cut ties with us, confining our international space and offending the people of Taiwan,  David Lee, Taiwan's minister of foreign affairs, told a briefing in Taipei. Taiwan would immediately end cooperation with and assistance for Panama, and evacuate embassy and technical personnel  in order to safeguard our national sovereignty and dignity , Lee said.  China is deeply suspicious of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who it thinks wants to push for the island's formal independence, although she says she wants to maintain peace with Beijing. China and Taiwan have tried to poach each other's allies over the years, often dangling generous aid packages in front of developing nations, although Taipei struggles to compete with an increasingly powerful China. Related CoverageTaiwan president says China's move to establish ties with Panama affects cross-strait stabilityChina says Taiwan should make 'wise choice' on one China principleChina and Panama to cooperate on trade, investment, maritime affairs, tourismPanama is the second country to switch its recognition to Beijing since Tsai took office last year, following a similar move by Sao Tome and Principe in December, trimming to 20 the number of countries that formally recognise Taiwan. Taiwan had as many as 30 diplomatic allies in the mid-1990s, and its remaining formal ties are with mostly smaller and poorer nations in Latin America and the Pacific.  China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi met his counterpart from Panama, Isabel de Saint Malo, in Beijing on Tuesday and signed a joint communiqué establishing ties.  This is a historic moment. China-Panama relations have opened a new chapter,  Wang said, describing Panama's decision as in  complete accordance  with its people's interests and  in keeping with the times .  Panama's Vice President and Foreign Minister Isabel de Saint Malo (L) and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi pose with their documents after signing a joint communique on establishing diplomatic relations, in Beijing, China on June 13, 2017.Greg Baker/PoolChinese Largesse Panama said it recognised there was only one China, with Taiwan belonging to the Asian giant, and that it was severing ties with Taipei.  The Panamanian government is today breaking its 'diplomatic ties' with Taiwan, and pledges to end all relations or official contact with Taiwan,  it said in a statement. The establishment of links with Panama is a coup for China, which has been showering largesse on countries in Central America in recent years in an attempt to get them to break with Taiwan. Slideshow (4 Images)As recently as December, Panama's deputy foreign minister had said he did not expect any change in Panama's relations with Taiwan or China. Panama is one of Taiwan's oldest friends, but some diplomats in Beijing had earlier speculated that the Central American country could become the next nation to break ties. Tsai visited Central American allies this year but did not stop in Panama. In Beijing, Panama's foreign minister de Saint Malo said President Varela had expressed 10 years ago his interest in establishing ties with China, and that she hoped the move would lead to trade, investment and tourism opportunities, especially for  exporting more goods from Panama to China .  Matt Ferchen, an expert on China's relations with Latin America at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, said Panama's switch was bad news for Taiwan's relations in Central America, where it still has ties with El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.  It sets a sort of precedent that could very well influence the rest of the region,  Ferchen said. In addition to financial support, China offers the lure of growing international influence. Still, Ferchen said it was premature to read Panama's shift as a big gain for China's influence in the backyard of the United States.  If it becomes perceived that way in the United States among Congress and the U.S. presidential administration, or the U.S. military, you could really be stepping on some sensitive feet,  he said.

Four-times major winner McIlroy, one of the game's best drivers of the golf ball, had just spoken with reporters about how eager he was to attack the long, links-styled, rolling farmland course off the tee. However, he was left incredulous when informed that some of the fescue lining the generous fairways was being mowed.  Really? We have 60 yards from left line to right line,  an exasperated McIlroy said.  You've got 156 of the best players in the world here. If you can't hit it within that avenue, you might as well pack your bags and go home.  These are the widest fairways we've ever played in a U.S. Open. Even the first and second cut (of rough) is another 10 yards on top of that.  Some players in the field for the year's second major that gets underway on Thursday had grumbled about how hard it was to advance the ball out of the fescue that stood almost knee high. Early on Tuesday morning, U.S. Golf Association officials told a small group of reporters that areas of fescue would be mowed because the tall, thin grass was laying down due to the heavy rains that hit the area on Monday night and into Tuesday.  I get that it's thick and whatever, but it's a hazard,  McIlroy said.  It's a U.S. Open, it's supposed to be a tough test. And if guys can't put it into play within a 50-yard zone, I don't think they've got much to complain about.  McIlroy, who has played sporadically this year due to a rib injury, said he believed the 7,741-yard Erin Hills course suited him.  I don't feel like it's a secret that I feel like my driver is one of the biggest weapons in my bag,  said the 2011 U.S. Open winner at Congressional.   I wasn't crying when I saw that rain last night and this morning. It's a long golf course and it's only going to play longer. That benefits a few guys, and luckily I'm one of them.

Jeff Rottinghaus, portfolio manager of the T Rowe Price Large-Cap Core Equity fund (PAULX.O), said he has been adding money to existing tech holdings such as Facebook and Amazon because they are positioned to continue to grow over the next few years regardless of the direction of the overall economy. With other secular growth stories hard to find,  It's getting to the point where you have to say, 'What else do you want me to own?'  he said, adding that these companies continue to be up significantly year-to-date despite recent declines.  Analysts expect the S&P; 500 technology index .SPLRCT to grow its earnings by 12.4 percent this year, better than the S&P; 500's 11.6-percent expected growth, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  About 40 percent of the stocks in the S&P; 500 information technology index rose on Monday, including Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), which have lagged in 2017.      This tech selloff is a great buying opportunity,  said Navellier & Associates Chairman Louis Navellier, who bought shares of Micron Technology Inc (MU.O), Applied Materials Inc (AMAT.O), Arista Networks Inc (ANET.N) and STMicroelectronics NV (STM.PA). In the 8-year-old bull market, investors have consistently been 'buying the dips,' taking advantage of brief pullbacks in prices, so large-cap stocks have not seen a 10-percent correction in well over a year. Although stocks are expensive by historical measures, bullish investors say they are justified by growth in earnings and the U.S. economy, while historically low bond yields are also making stocks more appealing.

The stumble in tech comes a time when both mutual funds and hedge funds have taken outsized bets on the sector, helping push Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft to add a total $600 billion in market cap year-to-date. Tech stocks in the S&P; 500 rallied 21 percent for the year through June 2nd, with the largest companies accounting for 46 percent of the S&P; 500's 9-percent gain, according to Goldman Sachs.  That rally sent some tech-heavy tech funds soaring.  In May, Light Street Capital Management's $1.2-billion Halogen fund was up 11 percent and is up 42.6 percent this year through the end of May. The head of the fund, Glen Kacher, started his career at Tiger Management, Julian Robertson's famous fund.  Yet concerns that fund managers had piled into the same stocks and stretched their valuations helped prompt a selloff that began Friday and continued through Monday, sapping 5 percent or more from companies such as Apple.  Momentum-based technology stocks have  built a valuation air pocket underneath [them] creating cause for pause,  Goldman Sachs wrote in a note Friday. Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York, said he saw the tech selloff as a sign that investors were feeling more confident that the Trump administration could pass infrastructure or tax legislation later this year.  Last week's testimony by former FBI chief James Comey did not contain the sort of bombshell that investors had feared, Chiavarone said, prompting fund managers to rotate out of tech into sectors that have lagged.   It allowed folks to believe once again that Congress isn't going to be bogged down in a massive impeachment effort and could get some policy work done,  he said, which would benefit energy and financial stocks that initially rallied following Trump's unexpected victory but lost their gains following Inauguration Day.

The Senate voted 53 to 47 to narrowly defeat legislation that sought to block portions of a new, separate arms sale to Saudi Arabia, agreed during a visit there by President Donald Trump in May. Arms sales to Riyadh have become increasingly contentious in the U.S. Congress, where some lawmakers object that American weapons have contributed to widespread civilian casualties in a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. Republican Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, a Democrat,  suspended the planned sale of precision-guided munitions in December because of concerns over civilian casualties in Yemen, where the civil war pits Iran-allied Houthi rebels against the government backed by a Saudi-led Arab coalition. Trump, however, has said he wants to encourage weapons sales as a way to create jobs in the United States.  Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration had notified Congress about the start of deliveries on the 2015 sale. He said in a statement that Trump's decision was another reason for the Senate to disapprove the new sale.  We need to send a message to both the Trump Administration and the Saudis to work much harder to avoid civilian casualties, expedite humanitarian relief, and push for a peaceful end to the war through a negotiated political settlement,  Cardin said. Republicans control both chambers of Congress. A senior congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the notification was received last Thursday. The decision to move ahead with deliveries was first reported by Bloomberg. The 2015 sale included more than 8,000 Laser Guided Bombs for the Royal Saudi Air Force. The package also includes more than 10,000 general purpose bombs, and more than 5,000 tail kits used to inexpensively convert  dumb  bombs into laser or GPS-guided weapons. Some of the weapons systems included in the sale were made by Raytheon Co and Boeing Co.  The arms deal announced in May was for $110 billion, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. Tuesday's Senate vote, which would block about $500 million of that sale, including precision-guided munitions and other offensive weapons, coincides with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other officials in Washington.

Military spokesman Brigadier General Restituto Padilla said the urban terrain was hampering the army's progress because the rebels had hunkered down in built-up neighborhoods, many of them with civilians they had taken as human shields. Hundreds of other civilians were still trapped in the ruins of the town and - facing capture, starvation or bombardment from above - several have braved sniper fire to dash across a bridge to safety. Some were shot dead, a few made it alive. Asked when the fighting would end, Padilla said:  I can't give you an estimate because of compounding developments faced by ground commanders.  The military had set Monday, the Philippines' independence day, as a target date to flush out the militants, both local and foreign fighters who have pledged allegiance to Islamic State. Flags were raised at ceremony in the town on the insurgency-plagued island of Mindanao, but heavy gunfire resumed early on Tuesday, and the military continued to target the militants with mortars and helicopter-mounted machineguns. President Rodrigo Duterte, who declared martial law in Mindanao on May 23 - hours after several hundred fighters overran parts of the town and tried to seal it off to create an Islamic caliphate - did not show at any independence day events. Duterte is best known for a brutal war on drugs since he took office a year ago, and he has suggested that funding for the Islamist militants came from the narcotics trade. Some media reports highlighted the absence of the president at a time of serious conflict, but a spokesman said he was tired and needed to rest. Related CoverageBraving sniper fire, civilians dash for freedom in Philippines townThe Philippines has been fighting twin insurgencies from Maoist-led rebels and Muslim separatists in the south for nearly 50 years. Critics say military action is not enough to bring peace to a region that has long suffered from political neglect and poverty. 'Pure Propaganda' The seizure of Marawi has alarmed Southeast Asian nations which fear Islamic State - on a backfoot in Iraq and Syria - is trying to set up a stronghold on Mindanao that could threaten their region. The ultra-radical group's news agency, Amaq, said the military in the largely Christian Philippines had  completely failed  to take back Muslim-majority Marawi.  Islamic State fighters are spread in more than two-thirds of Marawi and tighten the chokehold on the Philippine army that is incapable of maintaining control of the situation,  it said. An Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) moves along a road of Amai Pakpak as government troops continue their assault against insurgents from the Maute group, who have taken over large parts of Marawi City, Philippines, June 13, 2017.Romeo RanocoPadilla branded the Amaq report  pure propaganda . Responding to the report, Lieutenant General Carlito Galvez, head of military command in Western Mindanao, told Reuters the militants controlled 20 percent of the town. That is at least twice the area that the military had given a week ago, when it had said the rebels were holed up in a sliver of urban terrain equal to 10 percent and shrinking. Almost the entire population of about 200,000 fled after the militants tried to overrun it, but the military believes that beyond the checkpoints now fencing off its main roads there are still some 300-600 civilians trapped or being held hostage. Slideshow (6 Images)Padilla said about 100 militants were still fighting, down from the estimated 400-500 who stormed the town. Former military chief Rodolfo Biazon told ABC-CBN television on Monday that the government seemed to be struggling to control the situation because rebel forces could move freely in an out of the town, raising the prospect of reinforcements.  Marawi has porous boundaries. You see them in one place of Mindanao today, you see them in another place tomorrow,  said Biazon, also a former legislator. As of Tuesday, the number of security forces and civilians who had died in the battle for Marawi officially stood at 58 and 26, respectively. The death toll of militants was put at 202. Islamic State's Amaq news agency said that at least 200 government troops had been killed and many had abandoned their posts, leaving behind weapons that were seized by the militants. It released a video showing the insurgents fighting and what it said was the execution of six Christians who were shot simultaneously in the back of the head. Reuters was not able to independently confirm the authenticity of the video. At dawn on Tuesday, five police officers and five Christian civilians ran through the city's commercial district to reach a government-controlled area on the Agus River's west bank. The military said that, in another incident, the insurgents knocked on the door of a house where 18 people were hiding. They escaped through a back door, but five were shot dead, eight were captured and only five made it to safety at the river.

Consistency - going to bed and waking up at about the same time every day, weekends included - was linked with a better grade point average (GPA) among the college students in the study, the researchers found.  “College students who sleep starved themselves during the week and then binge slept on weekends had poorer grades than those whose schedules were more consistent,” senior author Dr. Charles Czeisler, director of the Sleep Health Institute at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, told Reuters Health by email.  Importantly, it didn’t matter how much sleep the students got overall. Sleep timing on its own could predict worse academic performance, even if students made up for lost night-time sleep with naps during the day, according to the results published in Scientific Reports. Czeisler and colleagues studied 61 full-time undergraduates ages 18 to 24 for 30 days. Students completed sleep diaries and the researchers used the Sleep Regularity Index (SRI), a tool they developed, to evaluate the students’ sleep patterns. The index is scaled so that someone who sleeps and wakes at exactly the same time each day scores 100, and someone who sleeps and wakes at random times scores 0. Those who scored in the top 20 percent were classified as regular sleepers and those who scored in the bottom 20 percent were irregular sleepers.  Both groups averaged about seven hours of sleep daily, though irregular sleepers reported poorer sleep quality.  Regular sleepers were asleep 55 percent of the “clock night” – the hours between 10 p.m. and 10 a.m. - and only 1 percent of the clock day, whereas irregular sleepers slept for 42 percent of the clock night and 11 percent of the clock day. As a result, irregular sleepers experienced significantly less daytime light and relatively more light at night, which triggered a delay in secretion of the sleep hormone melatonin in the body, according to the researchers. These differences led to a body clock shift in irregular sleepers equivalent to traveling west for almost three hours, Czeisler said, which could explain their poorer academic performance. “For students whose sleep and wake times were inconsistent, classes and exams scheduled for 8 a.m. were occurring at 5 a.m. body time - a time when cognitive performance is impaired,” he said. Greater sleep regularity was associated with better GPAs. Every 10-point increase on the sleep regularity index was associated with an average increase of 0.10 points in GPA. At the end of the study, irregular sleepers averaged GPAs of about 3.24 out of a possible 4.0, and regular sleepers averaged 3.72. The study doesn’t prove that irregular sleep causes poorer academic performance, the researchers note, but it could be a sign of other daily habits that interfere with how well students do in college.  Increasing exposure to daytime light and decreasing exposure to laptops and other light-emitting devices before bedtime might improve sleep regularity, they suggest. Sleep specialist Dr. Rafael Pelayo of the Stanford Sleep Medicine Center in California told Reuters Health that while it’s possible some people handle sleep deprivation better than others, many students may be underperforming and not realize it. “I compare it to having a race car,” Pelayo said. “The manufacturer may recommend high-octane gas, but you can put cheap gas in it and if you’re stuck in traffic, you won’t notice a difference. But if you put it on a race track, you will. The real question is, ‘Could you do better academically if you had better quality sleep?’” Typically, students say when they go to bed or wake up depends on what day it is. When they’re on different schedules every other day and on the weekend, Pelayo noted, “the brain gets thrown off. It’s like always being jetlagged - you’re never quite at your best.” Instead, he advises, pick the earliest time you have to wake up, and make that your default wakeup time for the whole week. Do the same for bedtimes. “Do that for several weeks to get into a rhythm, because making your sleep predictable is going to make you feel better and do better.” SOURCE: go.nature.com/2rWXLmx Scientific Reports, online June 12, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sleep-college-grades-idUSKBN1942M6"},

{"news_time":"2017-06-13 15:15:00","news_title":"IMPACT ANALYSIS: Latest U.S. spoofing cases show regulators' focus, highlight chat rooms","keywords":"United States,David Liew,Gola,James McDonald,BC,FINREG,REGULATORS,CHATROOMS","sector":"Subjects","content":"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - The misuse of chat rooms has been a central component in many recent cases where market manipulation, collusion, or  spoofing  was involved. The electronic record of communication has proven to be a proverbial smoking gun for prosecutors and regulators in a string of cases, which is likely to continue. Recently, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a settlement and a guilty plea in parallel civil and criminal actions involving David Liew [here], a trader accused of manipulating and spoofing in the precious metals markets. Below is a refresher on spoofing and a review of the settled case and guilty plea as they offer reminders for senior managers, compliance professionals, and traders in a number of areas. Cftc and Doj Emphasis On  Spoofing    Spoofing  is a form of market manipulation, nowadays often done using computer algorithms, to rapidly display and cancel orders just before execution. It can be done hundreds or even thousands of times daily. The practice of displaying bids or offers and canceling them before execution, or with only a partial execution, has been employed in one form or another by traders in virtually every market as long as most traders can recall. It was seen as part of the skill and strategy in trading and the working of orders to get the best execution. However, over time the act of simple bluffing in the marketplace got out of control with the advancements in technology and automation.  The CFTC and the largest futures exchange, the CME, were empowered to crack down on this activity under Section 747 of Dodd-Frank which amended the Commodity Exchange Act making it unlawful for a person to engage in any trading, practice or conduct subject to the rules of a registered entity such as a futures exchange that  is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, 'spoofing' (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).  With this change in law after Dodd-Frank, civil and criminal enforcement authorities had a mandate, but the first challenge for prosecutors was to more precisely define spoofing. The CFTC began by publishing interpretive guidance in 2013 on spoofing and other disruptive trading practices. The CFTC guidance clarified that a spoofing violation requires a market participant to act with some degree of intent beyond recklessness. It also states that legitimate, good-faith cancellation or modification of orders or properly placed stop-loss orders would not be considered unlawful spoofing. In order to distinguish legitimate trading from spoofing, the CFTC would evaluate the market context, the person's pattern of trading activity including fill characteristics and other relevant facts and circumstances. The prohibition on spoofing covers  bid and offer activity on all products, traded on all registered entities.  The CFTC provided examples of unlawful spoofing, such as creating an appearance of false market depth, delaying another participant's executions, activity that could overload the quotation systems, and submitting or canceling bids or offers with the intent to create artificial price movements upward or downward. The CFTC has also cautioned that  even a single instance  of spoofing could constitute a violation. A Review of David Liew's Actions  The CFTC settlement involving David Liew, did not identify his employer.  Throughout the settled case the CFTC referred to Liew's employer generically as a large financial institution  financial institution 1  and mentioned other firms and traders at such firms generically. Media outlets have named Deutsche Bank as his employer; the CFTC would not comment when Regulatory Intelligence inquired. David Liew's attorney also did not respond to a request for comment, and Deutsche declined to comment to other media outlets. The settlement stated that Liew is cooperating with the investigation, and protected the identities of other firms and individuals involved. Such cooperation and identity protection suggest a potential for additional actions involving others in the case. In other recent cases involving spoofing, the firms were identified along with individuals, and in some instances the firms were also slapped with significant fines for failure to supervise and stop the illicit actions of the traders. The cases mentioned below involving two traders at Citibank are an example. In the press release [here] announcing the CFTC settlement with Liew, James McDonald, the CFTC’s Director of Enforcement said,  Today’s enforcement action demonstrates that the commission will aggressively pursue individuals who manipulate and spoof in our markets. Today’s action also shows that while holding individuals accountable for their conduct, the commission will give meaningful cooperation credit to those who acknowledge their own wrongdoing, enter into a cooperation agreement and provide substantial assistance to the division in its investigations and enforcement actions against others who have engaged in illegal conduct.  According to the plea agreement and the CFTC settlement, from December 2009 to February 2012, Liew conspired with other gold, silver, platinum and palladium traders to place hundreds of orders to buy or sell precious metals futures contracts that he intended to cancel and not to execute at the time he placed the orders, a practice known as spoofing. It quoted Liew's conversations with other traders via an unspecified chat channel. The CFTC said,  In a March 29, 2011 chat with Trader A at Financial Institution 2, Liew explained his spoofing strategy: 'basically i sold out ... by just having fake bids ... (in) the futures ... i just spam bids below ... to clear my offer.'  Liew pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the criminal complaint. Federal sentencing guidelines call for 24 to 30 months in prison, in addition to supervised release, fines, forfeiture and restitution, but the plea agreement says that if Liew cooperates with authorities, prosecutors will recommend a lighter sentence. The Liew settlement with the CFTC is the regulator's eighth successful action in recent years involving spoofing, a record which sends a clear message that the activity will not be tolerated. Similarities to an Earlier Case Involving Traders at Citi  Earlier this year the CFTC announced enforcement settlements with two Citibank traders, Stephen Gola and Jonathan Brims. Gola, a managing director, was fined $350,000 and Brims, a vice president, $200,000. Both traders were banned from trading in the futures markets until six months after each trader has made full payment of his respective penalty. The sanctions followed a $25 million fine imposed in January on Citigroup Global Markets for spoofing and for a failure to supervise, and provide appropriate training for, its traders. The underlying key facts are the same for all three enforcement actions, indeed the facts stated in the Gola and Brims orders are almost identical. The CFTC found that for around 18 months to the end of 2012 that both Gola and Brims were involved in spoofing.  In addition to executing the spoofing strategy individually, the traders also coordinated with others on the U.S. Treasury desk to implement the spoofing strategy. In some cases, one or more spoofing orders were placed after another trader had placed one or more, smaller, resting orders in the same or a correlated futures or cash market. In other instances, another trader would place spoofing orders to benefit the smaller resting orders.  The traders knew that at least one other U.S. Treasury trader was using the spoofing strategy, but they chose not to report it to compliance, according to the CFTC. Specifically, when a Citigroup trader in Tokyo used the spoofing strategy and a spoofing order of 4,000 lots traded, the trader called other members of the U.S. Treasury desk, including Gola and Brims, to discuss the trade. Compliance Takeaways and Suggestions  The sanctions imposed on the two traders at Citi indicate that wrongdoing will not only result in a fine for the firm but also for individual violators. The CFTC did not explain why the fines differed substantially in size given the same underlying facts. The six-month ban could be seen as a less severe part of the punishment, given that spoofing is, in effect, market abuse. Golan and Brims may not be the end of the story, as the original Citigroup fine stated that five traders were found to have been engaged in spoofing. In the case of David Liew, the CFTC and DOJ imposed a lifetime ban which was likely part of the negotiated settlement in exchange for perhaps leniency with regards to the fine and or sentencing. There are a number of lessons for both firms and senior managers. Citigroup itself was credited for its cooperation with the CFTC and the pre-emptive action it took, but was still fined $25 million. For the firm perhaps the most serious issue was the failure to supervise the traders and the apparent proliferation of spoofing as a 'normal' trading strategy.  Another key lesson is the need for not only training, knowledge and awareness of all relevant policies and procedures but the need to embed the expectation that violations or rule breaches will not be tolerated. In other words, that a culture of compliance is not only embedded but tested as operating effectively within a firm.  The CFTC has been focused on market integrity and spoofing in particular. In addition to the Citigroup, Gola and Brims cases, recent examples of enforcement can be used as strong examples as part of a firm's continuing training and awareness program. Of particular relevance are the December 2016, fine imposed on Igor B. Oystacher and 3Red Trading of $2.5m for spoofing and the use of a 'manipulative and deceptive device' while trading futures contracts on multiple futures exchanges, and the November 2016 order under which Navinder Singh Sarao was required to pay more than $38 million in monetary sanctions for price manipulation and spoofing as part of his role in the  flash crash  of May 2010.  In the wake of these enforcements firms must review policies, procedures, training as well as systems and controls around trading desks. Firms may wish to test specifically the existing controls around desk supervision and to consider the balance of preventative and detective controls around trading books to help ensure that only trades in line with agreed strategies and risk appetite are placed and executed. Compliance professionals need to immediately brush up on trading as well as their algorithm and computer-programming knowledge. Compliance departments should also undertake a thorough review and be sure to gain a complete understanding of the programs or algorithms being used. Firms must adopt controls such as pre-trade risk controls and order cancellation systems.  A review of cancellation of bids and offers is especially important in pre-market, periods of thin trading or lighter volume, and opening and closing periods. There also needs to be a review to see if there is any connection between cancellation activity and market prices.  Compliance professionals will need to develop, test, and monitor in real-time any algorithms and trading activity. They should also be sure to test the algorithm before it is used and have a real-time monitoring system for the trading algorithms. Legal experts agree that the regulators are stringing together a series of successful cases on spoofing and the smoking gun is often the electronic communications, instant messages, and chat rooms that solidify the evidence. Regardless, compliance departments definitely need to take these proactive steps now and stay abreast of the regulatory developments. The cooperation credit awarded to Liew and Citigroup is noteworthy and indicative that the investigations in the areas of market manipulation and spoofing are still underway and are clearly a priority with the regulatory bodies as well as law enforcement. --CFTC Interpretive guidance - spoofing:here (Todd Ehret is a Senior Regulatory Intelligence Expert for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.

Poloz said that the central bank's 2015 interest rate cuts  have largely done their work,  signaling that the BOC could raise interest rates sooner than previously thought.                  Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said late on Monday that first-quarter growth in Canada had been  pretty impressive,  and that signs economic growth was broadening would lead the central bank to consider whether current low rates would still be required.                    It's one of the biggest moves we've seen over the past year  in the Canadian dollar, said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto.  That's dragging some of the dollar bloc currencies with it.      Speculators have more than 120,000 short contracts on the Canadian dollar, with net short bets remaining near a record high, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters.          The market had been overlooking the strengthening economic data from Canada, and obviously now that we’re starting to see some change in communication from the Bank of Canada to acknowledge that ... the market won’t be able to look through that,  said MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman, in London.       The shift to a more hawkish stance will offer the potential for the Canadian dollar to strengthen further from here.       The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, fell 0.15 against a basket of currencies to a five-day low ahead of the start of the Federal Open Market Committee's June policy meeting       , as the euro edged higher       , staying just above $1.12.     Investors' focus Wednesday will be on the Fed's statement following the meeting and its assessment of the economy and inflation outlook.      Since the market is widely expecting the Fed to raise interest rates, the foreign exchange market reaction is likely to come more from any signaling with regards to the future path of monetary policy normalization,  said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York.     Investors will also be watching for any fresh details on the central bank's plans for trimming its balance sheet.     Sterling        regained almost the whole of its losses from Monday, rising 0.75 percent.     Both the Japanese yen        and Swiss franc        were flat.

We have repeatedly made our demands clear to the Turks, and we will not back down,  Roth told the newspaper.  We expect the immediate release of Yucel from pretrial detention and a process that follows the rule of law.  Roth, who met with Yucel's wife and one of his attorneys in Istanbul on Tuesday, said it remained unclear of what crime Yucel had been accused. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said Yucel had asked for improved conditions during a visit with German ambassador Martin Erdmann in Turkey on Tuesday.  I am relieved that Deniz Yucel says he is in good shape,  Gabriel said.  But that does not change our demand that we want to see him released and that he and his colleagues receive a speedy and fair process.  Turkish authorities arrested Yucel, who holds both German and Turkish citizenship, in February on charges of propaganda in support of a terrorist organisation and inciting public violence. Yucel denies the charges. [nL5N1GE7FP] Turkish officials have rejected Germany's demands for Yucel's release and say his case will be decided by the courts. [nI7N1II02M] No timetable for the case has been released. Germany's ambassador to Turkey, Martin Erdmann, spoke with Yucel for over an hour on Tuesday, according to a foreign ministry source.  The support from Germany - readings, concerts and car processions - are doing him good. He knows he is not so alone and that he has not been forgotten,  said the source. Ties between Germany and Turkey have been strained for over a year over a range of issues, including the Yucel case, Ankara's anger over a German parliamentary resolution calling the murder of Armenians by Ottoman forces a genocide, and Germany's statements criticising mass arrests after the failed July 15 coup in Turkey. Germany's cabinet last week backed plans to withdraw its troops from Incirlik air base in southern Turkey following Ankara's refusal to allow German lawmakers access to the base.

It said the friend, Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman, confirmed to NBC News that  he's now turning over any Comey memos that he has in his possession to the FBI.  Comey, fired by Trump last month, said in congressional testimony last week that he gave a memo describing his conversations with Trump to a close friend and told him to share its contents with a reporter. MSNBC said Richman also said Robert Mueller, special counsel leading an inquiry into possible links between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia, has been in touch with the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss how the panel can get access to the memos. The MSNBC report came as U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions appeared on Capitol Hill for a high-profile public session with lawmakers to answer questions about his dealings with Russian officials. Sessions is the most senior member of Trump's administration caught up in the controversy over whether associates of the president colluded with Russia to help Trump win the election. Attention in Washington has turned to whether Trump might seek to fire Mueller, the former FBI director named last month by the Justice Department to head the federal probe into the Russia issue. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who would be responsible for carrying out any such dismissal, told a different congressional panel on Tuesday he would not fire Mueller without good cause and he had seen no such cause. Sessions appeared before the intelligence committee just five days after Comey, whom Trump fired on May 9, told the panel Trump ousted him to undermine the agency's investigation of the Russia matter.

Canada's wireless market is dominated by three major players - Rogers Communications Inc, Telus Corp, and BCE Inc's Bell Mobility - with a high cost of entry making it difficult for smaller players to compete.  Until the current reality changes — if indeed it ever does — Canada will always have a problem of high retail wireless prices,  Jean-Pierre Blais, Chairman of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, said in remarks prepared for delivery at a event in Banff, Alberta on Tuesday. In the wide-ranging speech, days before his five-year term as chair of the CRTC ends, Blais said one option to help push prices down would be to force the big players to provide wholesale access to their wireless networks for  virtual  operators. That suggestion fits with the government's request from last week for the CRTC to reconsider a recent decision it says excludes Wi-Fi-based providers from broadening their access via the infrastructure of other companies. Blais said the CRTC could also consider regulating retail wireless prices or investigate the impact that network-sharing agreements have on competition. BCE and Telus share the cost of building out their wireless network but compete at a retail level for customers. BCE did not immediately respond to a request for comment and Telus was not immediately able to comment. Rogers directed queries to an industry group, the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association, which said the measures Blais suggested  would have a chilling effect on continued investment and growth . Blais had sought to put consumers at the center of his agenda, and during his tenure the CRTC told TV providers they must offer a basic package of programming for no more than C$25 per month, enacted a wireless code of conduct, and declared broadband internet access a basic service. In the speech he criticized the federal government's failure to fill empty commissioner roles and appoint a new vice-chair of broadcasting at the CRTC, calling it  just bad governance . The government has yet to name a replacement for Blais, whose terms ends on Saturday. He did not apply for an extension.

This is how I see feminism, about the empowerment of women,  she told a summit of female business leaders in London on Tuesday. Lennox, an award winning singer-songwriter turned women's rights and AIDS activist, started advocacy group The Circle to enable influential women to use their skills and resources to help women living in poverty. She stressed the importance of men joining the women's rights movement, praising a law change in Malawi to ban child marriage. In 2015, Malawi passed a law to raise the minimum age of marriage to 18 with UN Women working with traditional male chiefs to change local practices. Lennox, who shot to global fame in the 1980s with the Eurythmics band, now devotes most of her time to women's rights campaigning and raising awareness about HIV/AIDS. She decided to become an activist when she witnessed former South African president Nelson Mandela in 2003 describing the HIV/AIDS pandemic as a virtual genocide of the South African people, in particular of women and children.  While great strides have been made in treating and preventing HIV/AIDS, in many developing countries, inequality, social pressures and lack of education about the virus often make women more vulnerable to HIV infection than men. In sub-Saharan Africa, women and girls make up the majority of the HIV-positive population. HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age, according to the World Health Organization.   We think of HIV/AIDS in a particular way but we don't understand who is at the epicenter of the AIDS pandemic in Africa, and it is young girls and young women,  Lennox told the Fortune Women Summit in London.

The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates when it concludes its meeting on Wednesday, although investors will focus on any new hints on the pace of hikes this year and its assessment of the economy and inflation.            Gold prices turned higher about an hour-and-a-half before Sessions faced questions about his dealings with Russian officials and whether he intentionally misled Congress, as a Senate panel investigates alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.                   Gold's quick recovery from under $1,260 has emboldened micro-term bulls who may see the outcome of Attorney General Jeff Sessions' testimony to likely be one-sided,  said Tai Wong, director of base and precious metals trading for BMO Capital Markets in New York.      Whatever Sessions says won't satisfy the braying critics and there's always a chance something inflammatory drops.      Spot gold        was up 0.16 percent at $1,267.10 an ounce by 2:46 p.m. EDT (1846 GMT), after hitting a session low of $1,259.16, its weakest since June 2.     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery settled down $0.3, or 0.02 percent, at $1,268.60.      The Fed, which is scheduled to make a statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), may also provide more detail on its plans to shrink the mammoth bond portfolio it amassed to nurse the economic recovery.                   Obviously ahead of the meeting people aren't building significant positions. ... If anything, they're expecting a dovish Fed because recent (U.S.) economic data has been weak,  said Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at FOREX.com.     A lower-than-expected pace of rate hikes would weigh on the dollar, making dollar-priced gold cheaper for non-U.S. investors. The dollar index        turned lower on Tuesday.                 Among other precious metals, palladium        edged away from a 16-year high hit on Friday, and was last down 1.4 percent at $882.80 an ounce.      As there is no visible shortage of palladium for industrial uses, which account for more than 90 percent of demand, and car sales have been weaker-than-expected this year, we believe the rally in palladium prices is unsustainable,  said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst for UBS Chief Investment Office.     Silver        slipped 0.5 percent to $16.84 per ounce, having earlier hit $16.68, its lowest since May 19.      Platinum        fell 1.5 percent to $925.90 per ounce.

Technology shares edged higher after a two-session drop that put the spotlight on areas of the stock market where valuations appear stretched. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday and may also provide details on its plans to shrink $4.5 trillion of assets it amassed to nurse the economic recovery. Analysts say the Fed could take an aggressively hawkish posture of signaling a balance sheet reduction this year and another rate increase in December.  Wednesday's meeting is pretty much a high-risk event,  said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasuries trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York. The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England also meet this week, although no major policy changes are expected. The gap between benchmark U.S and European bond yields held near its widest in a month as the Fed meeting also shone a light on the slow pace of change in European Central Bank policy. The Canadian dollar hit a two-month high after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the central bank's 2015 rate cuts  have largely done their work,  signaling that it could raise rates sooner than previously thought. The U.S. dollar index was down 0.2 percent. In the Treasury market, U.S. two-year yields touched 1.359 percent, their highest in a month, while three-year yields touched their highest since May 24 at 1.500 percent ahead of three- and 10-year note auctions on Monday. Big technology names like Microsoft and Alphabet helped prop up U.S. stocks, though materials led sector gains. The S&P; materials index was up 0.9 percent, and the S&P; energy index, which is this year's weakest-performing group, was up 0.6 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 88.05 points, or 0.41 percent, to 21,323.72, the S&P; 500 had gained 9.98 points, or 0.41 percent, to 2,439.37 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 37.03 points, or 0.60 percent, to 6,212.50. Tuesday's stock market action reflected  a continuation of running up some of the areas that have not participated over the course of the last few months, in combination with some speculation that the Fed is going to be more resolute about raising rates,  said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.6 percent, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.5 percent. Oil prices edged higher after OPEC detailed supply cuts around the world. Brent crude futures rose 0.9 percent to settle at $48.72 per barrel, while benchmark U.S. crude gained 0.8 percent to settle at $46.46.

Federal judge Sergio Moro also found Sergio Cabral, a former governor of Rio de Janeiro state, guilty on corruption and money laundering charges and sentenced him to over 14 years in prison. Investigators allege that while Bendine was at the head of Petrobras, he asked for and received 3 million reais ($907,770) in bribes from construction firm Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL].  Bendine was tapped by former president Dilma Rousseff to lead Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras, in early 2015, after the public learned about the sprawling  Car Wash  corruption investigation. Moro's order suggests corruption may have continued at Petrobras while the Car Wash probe investigated construction firms for paying billions of dollars in kickbacks to politicians and former executives at the oil company in return for lucrative contracts.

Petrobras did not respond to requests for comment.      The accusation against Bendine is based on plea-bargain testimony from Odebrecht's imprisoned former chief executive Marcelo Odebrecht, who testified Bendine was paid in return for helping his company win contracts. Odebrecht is among several firms that have admitted guilt and reached leniency deals during the three-year probe, which has expanded to include alleged graft at several other state-run enterprises.

{"news_time":"2017-06-13 15:02:00","news_title":"SEC identifies adviser cyber security flaws","keywords":"Jason WallaceNEW,BC,FINREG,ADVISERS,CYBER,RISK","sector":"Subjects","content":"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - In the wake of the recent WannaCry ransomware attack, the Securities and Exchange Commission's exam team is warning investment advisers that many are failing to perform steps critical to fighting cyber security attacks. In specific, a relatively high percentage of advisers examined are failing to conduct continuous cyber-risk assessments, nor are they performing penetration or venerability tests. The shortcomings were far higher among investment advisers than among broker-dealers, and concerns raised by the WannaCry attack were particularly relevant to smaller firms.  The weaknesses were discovered during the second round of cyber security exams under a 2014 exam initiative. The SEC conducted 75 examinations of SEC-regulated entities, aimed at assessing cyber security preparedness, including the firm's ability to protect client information.  A cyber security program without these components can expose a firm and its clients to increased risk of an attack like WannaCry. In early May, the attack infected networks of various organizations in more than 100 countries, targeting computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting data and demanding ransom payments in bitcoin. Sec Alert The SEC alert included data from broker-dealer and investment adviser examinations. The investment adviser category, which also included investment companies, appeared to be the least prepared for a cyber incident.  The exams found advisers are not adequately addressing cyber-risk assessments and penetration tests which are particularly relevant to smaller registrants in relation to the WannaCry ransomware incident, according to the SEC. However, the SEC found that nearly all investment advisers examined did have a process in place for ensuring regular system maintenance, including the installation of software patches to address security vulnerabilities. Just four percent of firms had a significant number missing critical and high-risk security patches or updates. Cyber-Risk Assessments The SEC found that 26 percent of advisers and funds examined failed to conduct periodic risk assessments of critical systems to identify cyber security threats, vulnerabilities, and the potential business consequences.  In a 2015 risk alert , announcing the second round of cyber security examinations, the SEC highlighted the importance of governance and risk assessment processes that are tailored to the adviser's business when attempting to manage cyber risk. The SEC also included a sample of documents that may be requested during examinations on the topic.  Guidance from the SEC's Division of Investment Management earlier in 2015 has proven to be a great source for the SEC's specific expectations when it comes to periodic assessments. Potential assessment topics include: • The nature, sensitivity and location of information that the adviser collects, processes or stores, and the technology systems employed to do so;  • Internal and external cyber security threats and vulnerabilities to the firm’s information and technology systems;  • The security controls and processes that the adviser currently has in place; • The likelihood and impact to the adviser and its clients if any information or technology systems are compromised; and  • The overall effectiveness of the fund’s or adviser’s ability to manage cyber security risk, including whether risks are identified and appropriately addressed. The guidance does not address initial assessments; the continuing efforts discussed presumably represent an extension of the initial cyber security assessment. In an initial assessment, taking an inventory of devices, connections, software and most importantly, sign-on capabilities that are at risk of cyber attacks is a good start. Having a complete picture of these elements will enable a firm to fully understand its cyber infrastructure and, in turn, help ongoing assessments of the program. Penetration and Vulnerability Tests The SEC examination discovered that 57 percent of the investment management firms examined failed to conduct penetration tests and vulnerability scans on systems that the firms considered to be critical.  Generally speaking, a cyber security penetration or vulnerability test is an authorized simulated attack on a network that looks for security weaknesses, potentially gaining access to the system's features and data. The SEC has not outlined any specific parameters for penetration or vulnerability tests; it assumed many firms would probably outsource the task to a third-party. However, the SEC will look for policies and records of such tests during an examination. In the 2015 risk alert, the SEC stated it will request during exams: • Information regarding the firm’s policies related to penetration testing, whether conducted by or on behalf of the firm, and any related findings and responsive remediation efforts taken; and  • Information regarding the firm’s vulnerability scans and any related findings and responsive remediation efforts taken. Lastly, the SEC also encourages broker-dealers and investment advisory firms to review the alert published by the United States Department of Homeland Security’s Computer Emergency Readiness and evaluate whether applicable Microsoft patches for Windows XP, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003 operating systems are properly installed. --SEC 2014 exam initiative:here --SEC 2015 risk alert:here --SEC 2015 Cybersecurity guidance:here (Jason Wallace is a senior editor for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.

José Sarukhán Kermez, who helped set up Mexico’s pioneering National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO), said that analyzing the genetic variability of traditional crops, and supporting the family farmers who grow most of the world’s food offered an alternative to industrial agriculture.  “We don’t need to manipulate hugely the genetic characteristics of these (crops)... because that biodiversity is there - you have to just select and use it with the knowledge of the people who have been doing that for thousands of years,” said Sarukhán, CONABIO’s national coordinator, in a telephone interview. The emeritus professor and former rector of the National University of Mexico (UNAM) recently won the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, often referred to as a “Nobel for the Environment”. Making use of the knowledge held by indigenous groups is “absolutely essential”, Sarukhán told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. That requires working with a wide range of people, from local cooks to small-scale farmers, especially in states like Oaxaca and Chiapas in the south of Mexico where indigenous farmers have a strong traditional culture, he said.  “They haven’t gone to university, and they don’t have a degree - but they damn well know how to do these things,” he said. For example, they discover and incorporate new knowledge as they exchange seeds with peers from different areas.  CONABIO is hoping to win some $5 million in funding from the Global Environment Facility for a five-year project worth more than $30 million to speed up research into indigenous crops.  The aim is to enrich the commission's vast online database of biodiversity, with a view to influencing national agricultural policy, said Sarukhán. CONABIO’s information on the genetic adaptability of native plants will enable scientists to develop new lines that can tolerate wetter or more arid conditions as the climate changes, he said. Highlighting the potential of climate-adapted native crops, Sarukhán said around 60 types of maize are grown across Mexico, from the coast to 3,000 meters (9,843 ft) above sea-level, while only a handful of species are sold commercially. Forest Protection With Mexico’s hugely varied ecosystems and biodiversity under threat, the ecologist urged a greater focus on schemes to boost local incomes rather than giving grants to encourage people to maintain vast swathes of the country’s forest.  Projects like growing organic coffee in Oaxaca’s forests or eco-tourism in Chiapas are helping provide communities with a decent income and an incentive to protect the environment, he said.  Rural and indigenous communities own 60 to 70 percent of all Mexico’s forests and natural ecosystems, he noted. “That is the patrimony they have - they don’t have anything else to live on,” he explained. “There are ways in which you can combine the sustainable management of the forest with more attractive incomes for the owners of the forest.” Reporting by Sophie Hares; editing by Megan Rowling.

Detentions in the first five months of 2017 were more than twice the previous two years combined, according to Canada Border Services Agency statistics provided last week in response to a Reuters request. Canada's detention of Mexicans surged more than tenfold from 24 in November to 331 in April, the data show. The number of Mexicans filing refugee claims more than quadrupled from November to March. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to lift the visa requirement, imposed by the previous government, during the 2015 election campaign in an effort to improve bilateral relations. Visitors from Mexico can now apply online for an electronic travel permit in a process that takes minutes. Mexican migrants have been looking to Canada as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration ramps up deportations and targets illegal immigrants who had been granted reprieves under the Obama administration. [L2N1GT12A][L1N1J6172] Trudeau's government has been under pressure from opposition politicians to reverse the visa lift, which a review late last year projected would cost about C$262 million.   The lifting of the visa requirement for Mexican citizens strengthens Canada-Mexico ties and builds momentum to expand trade, investment and tourism. It will provide lasting benefits for both countries,  immigration department spokesman Rémi Larivière said in an email.

The border agency can detain foreign nationals indefinitely on no charge if it believes they pose a danger to the public, if their identities are unclear or if they are deemed unlikely to appear for removal or for a proceeding.

They're usually offered: 'You can be in detention or you just go back and withdraw your request to enter the country,'  he said.  Most of them end up spending a night or two at the immigration holding center and then they go on the plane and go back home.  The number of Mexican citizens applying to extend temporary residence permits rose to 1,057 in March from 679 in November.   There was an anticipation of that possibility,  Scott Bardsley, spokesman for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, said by phone.  But that was all accounted for in the planning that was done to do the visa lift.  The statistics track the number of detentions, not the number of detainees, which means if a person is detained on multiple occasions those will be counted separately.

Financials were up 0.5 percent on Tuesday, while energy gained 0.7 percent. Materials were the top gaining sector, rising 0.9 percent. Tuesday's market action reflected  a continuation of running up some of the areas that have not participated over the course of the last few months in combination with some speculation that the Fed is going to be more resolute about raising rates than investors had begun to anticipate in the bond market,  said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 88.48 points, or 0.42 percent, to 21,324.15, the S&P; 500 gained 9.66 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,439.05 and the Nasdaq Composite added 33.89 points, or 0.55 percent, to 6,209.36. Traders are overwhelmingly expecting an interest rate increase when the Fed concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday. The central bank is scheduled to release its decision at 2 p.m EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday with a news conference to follow from Fed Chair Janet Yellen. Financials, which tend to benefit when rates are rising, also climbed after the U.S. Treasury Department announced a plan to upend the country's financial regulatory framework, which would grant many items on Wall Street's wishlist. In corporate news, Cheesecake Factory shares fell 9.5 percent after the restaurant chain warned of a decline in comparable store sales. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.69-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

I regard amicus briefs from the business lobby as a rough index of litigation threats to U.S. companies - or, at least, an indicator of what companies perceive to be litigation threats. Based on that assumption, it looks like businesses, and, in particular, pharmaceutical companies, are still worried about the prospect of treble damages in racketeering suits by alleged victims at the end of supposedly fraudulent schemes.  On Monday, the Chamber, NAM and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America submitted an amicus brief in a class action at the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Washington Legal Foundation (WLF) submitted a separate brief. Their argument: If the 7th Circuit allows plaintiffs' lawyers to abuse the threat of treble damages under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, free speech will be chilled.  That’s an interesting argument to posit in a case stemming from the U.S. government’s 2012 settlement with Abbott Laboratories for supposedly marketing the anti-seizure drug Depokate fraudulently as a treatment for schizophrenia and dementia. The class action at the 7th Circuit was filed by healthcare plan sponsors alleging that because they ultimately paid for Depakote improperly prescribed for their members, they were the ultimate victims of what they call a racketeering scheme by Abbott and its spinoff AbbVie.  In February, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis of Chicago tossed the health plans’ racketeering claims, holding that the plaintiffs could not show Abbott and AbbVie directly caused their supposed damages. The defendants, according to Judge Ellis, did not make false representations about Depakote directly to health plan sponsors but to physicians who prescribed the drug for schizophrenia and dementia patients. Because of the doctors’ role, the judge said, the chain of causation between the health plan plaintiffs and the defendants is too attenuated to justify RICO damages.  Plaintiffs' lawyers at Grant & Eisenhofer, Hausfeld and Hach Rose Schirripa & Cheverie have asked the 7th Circuit to revive the racketeering claims. They argue that the 1st and 3rd Circuit have allowed health plans to wield RICO against pharma companies that fraudulently marketed Neurontin and Avandia and that the U.S. Supreme Court blessed RICO claims by third parties in 2008’s Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co. Abbott and AbbVie, represented at the 7th Circuit by Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler, countered that the Neurontin and Avandia decisions involved direct alleged misrepresentation to healthcare plans so those cases are not analogous to the Depakote suit. They also cited Supreme Court precedent that cautions against RICO suits based on extended causation chains, as well as a 1999 7th Circuit ruling that dismissed healthcare plans’ RICO claims against tobacco companies as too attenuated. A host of RICO suits, Abbott said, have been filed by healthcare plans trying to capitalize on government settlements with pharmaceutical companies accused of fraudulent marketing. The vast majority of those cases have been tossed, Abbott argued.  Nevertheless, the business lobby felt compelled to weigh in. And though the Chamber and WLF briefs overlap considerably with Abbott’s filing, the business groups are worried about broader implications for pharma companies if the 7th Circuit allows the Depakote RICO claims to move forward. “The importance of deterring such lawsuits extends beyond protecting pharmaceutical companies from the burdens of speculative litigation,” the Chamber brief said. “More broadly, such litigation potentially chills protected speech, deprives physicians and other medical professionals of truthful, beneficial scientific information and ultimately denies patients the advantage of informed medical treatment.”  WLF’s brief similarly argued that allowing the healthcare plans to sue over falsely marketed drugs would undermine effective care. “Unless drug manufacturers and others are permitted to speak freely regarding off-label uses, doctors will be unlikely to acquire all the information they need to treat their patients effectively,” the brief said. “RICO suits of this sort — in which reputable manufacturers are accused of “racketeering” and face potentially massive treble-damage awards — are likely to chill the dissemination of valuable medical information.”  Free speech is unexpected clothing for arguments to shut down a suit against defendants accused of fraudulent marketing, but the business groups are worried the 7th Circuit will make it easier for plaintiffs at the end of a causation chain to claim RICO damages. Their goal is to make sure the appellate court requires a direct link between defendants’ conduct and RICO damages.  “They may be concerned in general that RICO may have a resurgence,” said James Sabella of Grant & Eisenhofer, who represents the lead plaintiffs in the Depakote case. Sabella said he doubts the amicus free speech arguments will influence the 7th Circuit in light of his clients’ detailed allegations of patients improperly prescribed a drug that was at best ineffective and at worst unsafe.  “It’s hard to believe the court will believe this is the kind of speech RICO claims should be tossed to protect,” Sabella said.  I left a phone message for lead defense counsel William Cavanaugh and put in a request to speak with the Chamber about its brief but did not hear back.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-amicus-idUSKBN1942KB"},

The helium plants operated by RasGas, a subsidiary of state-owned Qatar Petroleum (QP), were shut after Saudi Arabia closed its border with Qatar, blocking overland exports of the gas, a QP official told Reuters. RasGas is 70 percent owned by QP and U.S. giant Exxon Mobil has 30 percent. The official declined to be named under briefing rules. Phil Kornbluth, head of U.S.-based industry consultancy Kornbluth Helium Consulting, said his sources had confirmed the closure. The closure of the plants is a sign of how the rift between Qatar and Arab powers could affect commodities markets. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport ties last week, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism, a charge Doha denies. Qatar's exports of liquefied natural gas at Ras Laffan have been unaffected by the boycott. The impact on the global helium market was expected to be delayed, as consumers use up existing stocks and work out alternative supply options. Shipping by sea directly from Doha or through Oman would add complexity, risk and cost. But if the diplomatic dispute lasts a month or more, Kornbluth predicted there would be a global shortage and the last time that happened, prices doubled.  Helium is the single commodity that is affected most by this blockade because it's probably the only thing where Qatar is a major world producer and the supply has been completely cut off,  he said. Among its uses, helium is used to cool superconducting magnets in medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, as a lifting gas in balloons and airships, as a gas to breathe in deep-sea diving and to keep satellite instruments cool. It is derived from natural gas during processing. The two plants shut by Qatar have a combined annual production capacity of approximately 2 billion standard cubic feet of liquid helium and can meet about 25 percent of total world demand for the gas, according to RasGas' website. Kornbluth said the helium plants had shut down after filling all available shipping containers and storage tanks. He forecast the closure was costing RasGas revenue. Finding New Supplies Helium, best known as a gas for filling party balloons and making the voice squeaky, is difficult to capture and store. The United States is the biggest producer in what is a $4.7 billion industry, according to Mordor Intelligence. Demand for the gas, driven particularly by Asia's booming manufacturing industry, is on the rise. U.S. reserves meanwhile are dwindling due to the lack of helium production from its oil and gas fields, and the country has already had to start importing helium from Qatar. Other helium-producing countries include Algeria, Russia, Canada and China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A Dubai-based vendor servicing the local market said on Tuesday it had not received new shipments from Qatar since last week, forcing it to dip into its stocks. Japan's Iwatani, which supplies helium to China and Southeast Asia, said it had a month's supply in stock. A spokesman told Reuters it was considering exporting on ships from a Qatari port, or sourcing from the United States. German industrial gases company Linde said it was working on meeting customers' requirements via helium sources in Australia, Algeria and the United States. Air Water, which imports from Qatar and sells in Japan, has shifted its helium supply automatically to the United States, a spokesman said. A source with direct knowledge of the matter said South Korea's importers, which source a third of their helium from Qatar, could suffer heavily.  We might have an indirect impact if U.S. helium prices go up,  the source said. (Editing by David Clarke)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/gulf-qatar-helium-idUSL8N1JA4TU"},

Researchers found that mothers who experienced a fever over 99 degrees F (37.22 C) during the second trimester of pregnancy had a 40 percent increased risk of having a child with ASD compared to women who had no fevers.  But none of the women who used ibuprofen to treat a fever during pregnancy gave birth to children later diagnosed with autism, the researchers note. “What is particularly important about our findings is that it not only strengthens the evidence for a particular pathway for ASD, but it also suggests that we may be very close to understanding how to safely mitigate or prevent some outcomes by directing prevention or intervention strategies toward this pathway,” said lead author Dr. Mady Hornig of Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health in New York. An increased risk of ASD among women with prenatal fevers has been reported before, the authors write in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. What’s new about this study is that it is the first large, prospective investigation showing a so-called dose-response effect.  The chances of ASD rose with the number of maternal fevers, increasing by more than 300 percent if a mother had three or more fevers after the first trimester.  Since fever is caused by acute inflammation, the profound difference in risk of ASD is consistent with the idea that a longer exposure of the fetus to an inflammatory environment in the womb can cause a greater disruption of brain development, said Hornig. A crosstalk of immune molecules called cytokines can reach the fetus across the placenta to affect the developing brain. The findings also provide clues to suggest women are using the wrong drug during pregnancy to bring down fever, according to Hornig. While none of the mothers who took the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) ibuprofen to treat fever during the second trimester had a child who developed ASD, mothers who took acetaminophen during this time made very little difference in their child’s fever-related risk for ASD. The study analyzed data on 95,754 women participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, which is following pregnant Norwegian women and their children born between 1999 and 2009.  Among its limitations is that small numbers of women used ibuprofen during pregnancy so researchers can’t be confident that ibuprofen had mitigating effects. In addition, the study did not address the causes of fever, such as microbial infections. “An ongoing study is testing blood samples collected at mid-pregnancy and at birth to explore the possible role of specific infectious agents and the contribution of distinctive patterns of immune response among mothers and children to understand the mechanisms creating vulnerability,” the researchers note in a statement.  “This is a really important study that sheds light on risk factors for ASD because of its size and it looked at how the use of different medications, as well as how the timing of a fever affects the risk of ASD. I don’t think previous studies have done that well enough. However, the studies have not been entirely consistent so we need to conduct more of them to sort out these effects,” said Dr. Geraldine Dawson, who wasn’t involved in the study. Dawson, who directs the Duke Center for Autism and Brain Development in Durham, North Carolina, said she thinks it’s very important that fever and the medications used to treat it not be considered to be the causes of autism, but rather potential risk factors, just as cholesterol and high blood pressure are risk factors for heart disease. “Fever may contribute to risk of ASD, but likely doesn’t operate in isolation,” she told Reuters Health.  Dr. Nathaniel DeNicola, an obstetrician at George Washington University in Washington, DC, told Reuters Health it is premature to recommend any changes in medical practice based on the study. “In general, obstetrical practice won’t change with one study. We’ll need a large meta-analysis or systematic review to change our policy,” he said. There has been an increase in ASD, he added, and “maternal fevers may be along for the ride.

The company's debt pile made any acquisition very hard to structure. Talks between Neiman Marcus and its suitor Hudson's Bay Co (HBC.TO), the owner of high-end department store Saks Fifth Avenue, had made little progress because of this issue, Reuters reported in May. Neiman Marcus does not face any significant debt maturities until 2020, when a term loan of nearly $3 billion comes due, giving its private equity owners Ares Management LP (ARES.N) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) time to try to turn the business around.  Neiman Marcus, struggling to seek relief from its debt burden, hired investment bank Lazard Ltd to bolster its balance sheet, Reuters reported in March, as the company continued to struggle with lackluster demand in the face of stiff competition from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and fast-fashion retailers such as H&M; (HMb.ST) and Zara. To increase flexibility with creditors, Neiman Marcus announced in March it had named subsidiaries holding online store MyTheresa and some of its real estate  unrestricted,  making them not subject to the same rules under credit agreements as other units of the company.  The move could potentially allow Neiman Marcus to issue new debt to buy back its bonds at a discount, helping slash its debt pile.  Much of Neiman Marcus's debt load stems from its $6 billion leveraged buyout in 2013, when Ares and Canadian public pension fund CPPIB acquired it from other private equity firms. The company on Tuesday reported its fourth straight quarterly loss, and posted a nearly 5 percent dip in same-store sales for the third quarter ending April 29. Neiman Marcus posted a net loss of $24.9 million in the quarter, compared to a profit of $3.8 million a year earlier.   While looking ahead, we know challenges remain, but we are encouraged by the strategies we have in place to improve our operational efficiencies and performance,  Chief Executive Karen Katz said on a post-earnings call.

PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) - Jurors deciding the fate of a Minnesota police officer charged in the fatal shooting of a black motorist during a traffic stop last year took another look on Tuesday at two videos showing the incident and its immediate aftermath. St. Anthony Police Department officer Jeronimo Yanez was charged with second-degree manslaughter after he shot and killed Philando Castile, 32, in July in an incident that drew national attention and led to weeks of protests in St. Paul and Minneapolis. The jury began deliberations on Monday.​ Ramsey County District Judge William H. Leary III on Tuesday granted the jury's request to view again videos of the traffic stop, as captured by the dashboard camera in Yanez's squad car, and the Facebook Live post of the shooting's bloody aftermath filmed by Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, who was in the passenger seat next to him. Jurors had seen the videos at least twice before during the trial. The shooting in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights, like similar incidents across the United States, fueled public debate about appropriate use of force by law enforcement against minorities. The police video begins in silence as Yanez followed a white Oldsmobile car driven by Castile on a wide, lightly-traveled road. After Yanez activated his flashing lights, Castile stopped near a squat apartment building and row of trees. Yanez exited his car and told Castile his brake light was broken. After Castile disclosed that he had a firearm, Yanez can be heard saying,  OK don’t reach for it then.” Castile responded,  I was reaching,  but before he finished, Yanez, with right hand on his holster, said,  Don't pull it out.    I'm not pulling it out,  Castile said, in the audio of the police tape. Yanez then fired seven shots. Five shots hit Castile; two piercing his heart, prosecutors said. Another officer, perched on the passenger side of the vehicle, can be seen jumping back in the dashboard video.   Shots fired,  Yanez told police dispatch. Reynolds' voice can then be heard beginning her Facebook post.  Stay with me,  Reynolds told a bleeding, gasping Castile. Other officers soon arrived and Yanez is heard cursing and saying he told Castile to stop. Officers then removed Castile from the car and attempted to revive him.

The company's debt pile made any acquisition very hard to structure. Talks between Neiman Marcus and its suitor Hudson's Bay Co (HBC.TO), the owner of high-end department store Saks Fifth Avenue, had made little progress because of this issue, Reuters reported in May. Neiman Marcus does not face any significant debt maturities until 2020, when a term loan of nearly $3 billion comes due, giving its private equity owners Ares Management LP (ARES.N) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) time to try to turn the business around.  Neiman Marcus, struggling to seek relief from its debt burden, hired investment bank Lazard Ltd to bolster its balance sheet, Reuters reported in March, as the company continued to struggle with lackluster demand in the face of stiff competition from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and fast-fashion retailers such as H&M; (HMb.ST) and Zara. To increase flexibility with creditors, Neiman Marcus announced in March it had named subsidiaries holding online store MyTheresa and some of its real estate  unrestricted,  making them not subject to the same rules under credit agreements as other units of the company.  The move could potentially allow Neiman Marcus to issue new debt to buy back its bonds at a discount, helping slash its debt pile.  Much of Neiman Marcus's debt load stems from its $6 billion leveraged buyout in 2013, when Ares and Canadian public pension fund CPPIB acquired it from other private equity firms. The company on Tuesday reported its fourth straight quarterly loss, and posted a nearly 5 percent dip in same-store sales for the third quarter ending April 29. Neiman Marcus posted a net loss of $24.9 million in the quarter, compared to a profit of $3.8 million a year earlier.   While looking ahead, we know challenges remain, but we are encouraged by the strategies we have in place to improve our operational efficiencies and performance,  Chief Executive Karen Katz said on a post-earnings call.   Retailers have struggled to cope with changes in consumer tastes as shoppers increasingly shop online or spend on travel and big-ticket home improvement items and less on apparel and accessories. Earlier this year, Dallas-based Neiman Marcus also shelved plans for an initial public offering.

The eurosceptic, nationalist-minded governments in Poland and Hungary have refused to take in anyone under a plan agreed by a majority of EU leaders in 2015 to relocate migrants from frontline states Italy and Greece to help ease their burden.  The Czech Republic, another ex-communist central European state, initially accepted 12 people but has since said it would not welcome more.  I regret to see that, despite our repeated calls to pledge to relocate, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland have not yet taken the necessary action,  the EU's migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, told a news conference. He said the Commission was therefore launching so-called infringement procedures against the three, a way for the executive arm to take to task countries that fail to meet their obligations. It opens the way for months, even years, of legal wrangling before a top EU court could potentially impose fines.  From the political point of view, this action ... unnecessarily heats up political tensions, of which there are already too many in the European Union,  Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told state TV on Tuesday.  If necessary, Poland is ready to defend its legal arguments in court.  At stake in the dispute is the bloc's unity, already tested by Britain's unprecedented decision to leave, weak economies and higher support for eurosceptic parties across the EU.  Beyond its borders, the EU is also facing a resurgent Russia and a tricky new relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump. But two years of arm-wrestling have so far produced no results and EU leaders are unlikely to be able to break the impasse when they discuss the matter next week in Brussels.  The Czech Republic does not agree with the system of relocation,  Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said in response.  With regard to the worsened security situation in Europe and dysfunctionality of the quota system, it will not participate in it.  In a separate legal battle on the matter, Hungary and Slovakia have challenged the relocation agreement in a top EU court, with an initial indication of the ruling due next month.  Tarnished Unity     The easterners justify their stance on asylum seekers by citing security concerns, noting a series of militant Islamist attacks in western Europe since late 2015. The bulk of refugees come from the mainly Muslim Middle East and North Africa. Their resistance to what they present as pressure from Brussels also earns them credit with eurosceptic voters at home. Many other EU states have also dragged their feet over taking in refugees, with fewer than 21,000 people relocated from Italy and Greece so far under a plan that had been due to cover 160,000 people. Wealthier EU states including Italy - now the main gateway to Europe for African migrants and refugees - have threatened to reduce generous development funds earmarked to help the easterners close the gap in living standards. The Commission is backed in the feud by Germany and Sweden, countries that took in most of the people who arrived in the EU. They have been mounting pressure on the vehement easterners over recent weeks and months but to no result so far. Brussels' confidence has been boosted by ardently pro-EU French President Emmanuel Macron's victory over eurosceptics and nationalists, which gave the EU a renewed confidence a year after Brexit thrust it into an existential crisis.  But Avramopoulos said the timing of the decision came after the executive had been warning governments for months to change tack and had simply  exhausted all options  with the holdouts. An EU official said that despite its legal challenge, Slovakia had heeded the call to take in refugees and so escaped sanction. After more than a million migrants and refugees reached the EU in 2015, mostly via Greece, Brussels sealed an accord with non EU-member Turkey that sharply cut the overall number of arrivals, though the deal was criticized by rights groups. Italy remains under pressure, but the EU treats the vast majority of the 64,000 people who made it to Italian shores this year as migrants - rather than refugees requiring legal protection - and does not plan to let them stay. The internal EU dispute over relocating asylum-seekers is a political one about values, as Avramopoulos stressed in his renewed appeal to the easterners.  Europe is not only about requesting funds or ensuring security. Europe is also about sharing difficult moments and challenges,  he said.

Last year, however, it was the only one of eight large U.S. banks whose hypothetical wind-down plans were approved by both the U.S. Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

The video shot by a civilian on the scene shows Hernandez face-down on the ground and moaning with Terry Thompson on top of him with his arm around the man's neck.  Hernandez was taken to a hospital. He was in a coma and he died a few days later after life support was removed. He died from a lack of oxygen to the brain caused by strangulation and chest compression, the county medical examiner told local media. Lawyers for the couple said Hernandez was drunk and initiated the fight and they were just trying to subdue the man. Protesters who gathered outside court on Tuesday have accused the couple of excessive force, adding that racial bias against a Hispanic-American was a factor. As a part of their release on bond, state District Judge Kelli Johnson ordered the deputy and her husband to undergo drug testing and prohibited them from having contact with the Hernandez family, court officials said. If convicted, the two could face up to life in prison. Chauna Thompson was placed on unpaid leave by the sheriff's office in Harris County, which contains Houston, after being charged.

The remarks were a blunt reminder of the gloom underscoring U.S. military assessments of the war between the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the Islamist militant group, classified by U.S. commanders as a  stalemate  despite almost 16 years of fighting.  We are not winning in Afghanistan right now. And we will correct this as soon as possible,  Mattis said in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Mattis acknowledged that he believed the Taliban were  surging  at the moment, something he said he intended to address. Some U.S. officials questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and more than 17,000 wounded since the war began in 2001.  The Afghan government was assessed by the U.S. military to control or influence just 59.7 percent of Afghanistan's 407 districts as of Feb. 20, a nearly 11 percentage-point decrease from the same time in 2016, according to data released by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.

Deliberations include giving more authority to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters.  Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate committee, pressed Mattis on the deteriorating situation, saying the United States had an urgent need for  a change in strategy, and an increase in resources if we are to turn the situation around.

Delaware Senator Tom Carper and Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill, both influential members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, asked the inspectors general at 24 executive agencies and departments to investigate whether officials are using apps for work that make it hard to trace communications. The apps encrypt messages and automatically delete them after they are read, which could run afoul of laws on preserving government records, the senators wrote. While Republicans control both the Senate and the House of Representatives, Democrats in Congress can still request that inspectors general, neutral investigators who check up on various federal offices, look into specific matters.  They also asked the inspectors general if officials in the administration of Republican President Donald Trump are directing employees of government agencies to ignore requests for information from Democrats in Congress. Members of both parties objected after the administration said agencies do not have to honor requests made by senior Democrats on congressional committees. FILE PHOTO - U.S. Sen. Clair McCaskill (D-MO) speaks on the final night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. July 28, 2016.Mike SegarDemocrats and public interest groups are worried that the Trump administration is hiding important information about possible wrongdoing and stonewalling potential critics. They are also worried about social media, where Trump has tweeted and then later deleted posts. The office of the Department of Justice's inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who also chairs the council of federal inspectors general, declined to comment on the letter.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The federal government has strict laws on preserving records, which can be used to uncover and prosecute public corruption and collusion. Inspectors general themselves often rely on archived emails and text messages in investigations. Since Trump's inauguration in January many Washington insiders have embraced messaging apps that promptly destroy chats, encrypt texts and phone calls, and leave no trace of communication on smartphones. Concerns about information security have grown in the wake of the hack of the Democratic party's emails, criticism of candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private server and laws that count communications from non-government accounts as federal records. Journalists and officials now frequently communicate via the encrypted Signal or Confide messenger apps. Confide is so popular that the company hosted a media and technology event during this year's White House Correspondents Dinner weekend.

NOC said on Tuesday the arrangement would allow an immediate resumption of production at Wintershall's NC 96 and NC 97 concession areas in eastern Libya, as well as connected fields where production has been blocked. A Wintershall spokesman confirmed the agreement. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla told Reuters by phone from the oilfields on Tuesday that some wells at one of the affected fields, Abu Attifel, had already begun operating and production should resume there by Wednesday. Abu Attifel is operated by Mellitah, a joint venture between the NOC and Italy's ENI and has been closed since July 2015. Sanalla said he could see gas flares being relit as he was driving to the field with local officials.  Everybody is happy. We are all celebrating,  he said. Sanalla said the NOC was targeting an increase in national production to one million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of July from 830,000 bpd now. He said Abu Attifel alone should rapidly be able to produce 50,000-60,000 bpd. Libya's output remains well below the 1.6 million barrels a day it was producing before the 2011 uprising. Armed conflict, political disputes and local blockades have made production levels highly volatile since then. The dispute with Wintershall had caused a rift between the NOC and the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli. The NOC accused the government of siding with the German company and trying to appropriate powers over oil sector contracts in the process. The NOC said Wintershall had failed to honour a 2010 memorandum of understanding to convert its concessions to EPSA IV terms, or the standard NOC contract that governs deals with international oil companies in Libya. Wintershall had said its concession deals with Libya were still valid. The NOC said in a statement that the agreement announced on Tuesday,  allocates to Wintershall an amount of production sufficient to cover its costs, with all remaining production being allocated to NOC .  It also provides that during this interim arrangement, the parties will attempt to resolve their dispute regarding the legal framework governing the petroleum operations.

California's Department of Finance had not totaled the final budget numbers as of Tuesday morning, according to department spokesperson H.D. Palmer.

It also sends more money to the nation's largest public pension fund, California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), to help reduce the fund's unfunded liability. “This budget keeps California on a sound fiscal path and continues to support struggling families and make investments in our schools,” Brown said in a statement on Tuesday.  “This budget makes historic investments in healthcare, education, and childcare, and lays down a multi-billion dollar investment to start fixing our roads and infrastructure,” said Senate President pro tem Kevin de León.

DCOM expects to use net proceeds from the offering to call the entire $70.7 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding junior subordinated notes and underlying trust preferred securities that currently pay a 7% annual coupon. The remaining proceeds are to be used for general corporate purposes. Fitch affirmed DCOM's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and Viability Rating (VR) at 'BBB' and 'bbb' in March 2017. For more information pertaining to that rating action, please see the press release titled 'Fitch Affirms Dime Community Bancshares, Inc.'s Ratings at 'BBB/F2'; Outlook Stable' (March 29, 2017). KEY RATING DRIVERS SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The notes will be subordinated in right of payment to the payment of DCOM's existing and future indebtedness including deposit liabilities, future issuances of senior debt and other general creditors. The notes will however rank senior to the banks existing junior subordinated debentures underlying the outstanding trust preferred securities. The expected subordinated debt rating is notched one level below its VR of 'bbb' for loss severity. This is in accordance with Fitch's 'Global Bank Rating Criteria' dated Nov. 25, 2016 and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk profiles. RATING SENSITIVITIES SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES DCOM's subordinated debt ratings are broadly sensitive to the same considerations that might affect its VR. Fitch sees limited upside in the company's VR over the near term due to concentrations in the loan portfolio, undiversified earnings and relatively weak liquidity profile. The ratings are further constrained by the elevated risk associated with venturing into new commercial lending lines. Furthermore, the VR incorporates Fitch's expectation that growth from the Business Banking unit will be gradual and remain in the footprint where DCOM has hired the relevant expertise. Should this portfolio grow to over 100% of risk based capital over the next rating Outlook horizon, negative rating action could be taken. Fitch has assigned the following expected rating: Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. --Subordinated debt 'BBB-(EXP)'. Fitch currently rates DCOM as follows: Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. --Long-Term IDR 'BBB'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2'; --Viability Rating 'bbb'; --Support Rating '5'; --Support Rating Floor 'NF'. Dime Community Bank --Long-Term IDR 'BBB'; --Short-Term IDR F2'; --Viability Rating 'bbb'; --Long-term Deposits 'BBB+'; --Short-term Deposits 'F2'; --Support Rating '5'; --Support Rating Floor 'NF'.

Trump, who has more than 32 million followers on Twitter for his 8-year-old personal @realDonaldTrump profile, is known for messages on the social media site that are sometimes riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes.  Trump famously sent a tweet at 12:06 a.m. ET (0406 GMT) on May 31 that said:  Despite the constant negative press covfefe.  The message remained on the internet for hours, spurring a wave of speculation about what Trump intended to say. The message was later deleted.  Trump's next communication that day at 6:09 a.m. ET (1009 GMT) made light of the tweet, saying:  Who can figure out the true meaning of  covfefe ??? Enjoy!  Spicer, asked at a news briefing at the time whether people should be concerned about the covfefe tweet, said,  no  and added,  I think the president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant.

Knight,NASDAQ,BATS/MARKETCLOSE,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc has urged regulators to reject a proposal by rival exchange operator Bats to compete for stock orders at the market close, saying it would undermine Nasdaq's closing process and harm publicly-listed companies and their shareholders. Bats said in May it planned to offer brokers a type of order that would give them the same closing prices derived from the closing auctions on Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange for stocks listed on those exchanges, but with lower execution fees. The move by Bats, which only lists ETFs and the stock of its parent company, CBOE Holdings, would fragment the market close and result in less accurate pricing, Nasdaq said in a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated June 12. If Bats were allowed to compete for market close orders it would give it a bigger shares of the trillions of dollars in trades when fund managers execute most of their orders at the end of the session, pricing assets off closing prices on exchanges where they are listed.  With its proposal, Bats is not only failing in its responsibility to contribute to market transparency and price discovery, it is also impeding the ability of other national securities exchanges to do so,  Nasdaq's General Counsel, Edward Knight, said in the letter. Bats said its decision to offer  market-on-close  (MOC) orders was a result of its customers complaining that fees on listings exchanges are too high. Trading firms Virtu Financial and PDQ Enterprises, as well as agency broker Clearpool, threw their support behind Bats in separate letters to the SEC.  We believe that the Bats Market Close will introduce much needed competition to the markets,  Clearpool said. The  time is ripe for exchanges to price their offerings more competitively and equitably,  it added. If approved by the SEC, Bats would let market participants send in MOC orders to be pre-matched with other such orders 25 minutes before the 4 p.m. market close. The trades would be executed when the primary exchanges' closing prices were published. Orders that are not pre-matched could be sent to the primary exchanges' closing auctions. Knight said Bats was attempting to  free-ride  on the efforts and investments the listings exchanges have made toward their closing processes and that the proposal would undermine price discovery by diverting orders to Bats. NYSE has also blasted the Bats proposal, saying that diverting trades away from closing auctions would add to volatility and distort prices.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/nasdaq-bats-marketclose-idUSL1N1JA1EY"},

Juan Thompson, 32, entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan federal court. Showing little emotion, Thompson admitted that starting in 2016, he sent emails and faxes to his former romantic partner's employer containing false and salacious claims, and sent bomb threats to community centers, for which he tried to frame her.  I committed all of these acts with the intent to disrupt my ex-romantic partner's life and cause her great distress,  he said.  For this, I deeply apologize.  One of Thompson's lawyers, Mark Gombiner, said in court that he had agreed not to appeal any sentence of 46 months or less. Thompson was arrested in St. Louis, Missouri on March 3, and has been in custody since then, charged with one count of cyberstalking. A second count of making hoax bomb threats was added in a superseding criminal information revealed on Tuesday. Federal prosecutors said Thompson engaged in a vicious, months-long harassment campaign against his ex-girlfriend, using various email accounts to accuse her of possessing child pornography, driving drunk and, finally, making bomb threats targeting Jewish groups. Thompson made some threats in his own name and then accused his ex-girlfriend of framing him, and made other threats posing as her, prosecutors said. U.S. authorities have been investigating a surge of threats against Jewish organizations, including more than 100 bomb threats against community centers in dozens of states in separate waves since January. The organizations Thompson threatened included a Jewish museum in New York and the Anti-Defamation League, according to a criminal complaint in Manhattan federal court. All occurred after the first flood of phone threats in early January. Thompson was a reporter for the Intercept news website, which fired him last year saying he invented sources and quotes.

The Dutch holding company said on Monday that it plans to sell up to 7 percent of Altice USA, indicating an expected price range of $27-$31 per share, valuing the business at between $20 billion and $22 billion.  Of the projected $1.6 billion in proceeds at the top end of the price range, Altice USA would receive $374 million because about three quarters of the shares sold will be offered by London-based private equity firm BC Partners and fellow stakeholder the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). The IPO announced in April is viewed as a means for Altice's founder, French billionaire Patrick Drahi, to expand his burgeoning U.S. cable empire by giving Altice USA public stock it can use for further acquisitions. Altice USA will need all the financial firepower it can muster to compete for U.S. acquisitions with rivals Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) in an expected wave of sector consolidation.  The company has yet to indicate when it expects the IPO to take place. Upon completion of the IPO, Altice USA's parent and its affiliates will hold 75.2 percent of the company's capital and 98.5 percent of the voting rights thanks to a separate bundle of stock. BC Partners and CPPIB would jointly own about 17 percent of Altice USA, according to its filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This means that Drahi, the majority owner of Altice, will keep tight control of its U.S. division, led by Dexter Goei.

Baton-wielding riot police broke up Monday's protests and detained hundreds of demonstrators in Moscow and other Russian cities. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who called the protests, was arrested and swiftly sentenced to a prison term. The protests were some of the biggest in Russia since 2012.  The unpermitted action in the center of Moscow on June 12 was a vile and dangerous provocation. It is a miracle that nobody was injured,  Sobyanin said.  We all are lucky that there was no bloodshed.  Moscow authorities had initially authorized a venue for the  protest away from the city center. But Navalny switched it to Tverskaya Street, Moscow's main avenue near the Kremlin. The General Prosecutor's Office had warned that a protest there would be illegal.   The police and the OMON (riot police) acted in a professional and proper way,  Sobyanin said.  If the law enforcement had acted in a different way, this could have led to unpredictable consequences.  A top German Foreign Ministry official on Tuesday criticized the arrest of demonstrators and said Berlin expected them to be released swiftly. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also said in a statement that he was concerned by the detentions.  They were exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, which are enshrined in the Russian constitution,  Johnson said.  The UK calls on the government of Russia to comply with its international commitments in the Council of Europe and the OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe), and release citizens detained during peaceful demonstrations.  The Kremlin said earlier on Tuesday that Russian authorities would not pay attention to U.S. calls to release the detained demonstrators.

But anyone relying on state TV would have concluded they were a non-event. Vremya, state TV's flagship evening news show, relegated news of the protests to item nine of 10, and, in a report lasting around 30 seconds, said less than 2,000 people had shown up in Moscow. Some 150 people had been detained for disobeying the police elsewhere in the city, it said. The main news of the day, according to Vremya, had instead been President Vladimir Putin's handing out of state awards. The Internet, awash with images and videos of police hauling people off across the country and, in at least one case, of a protester being punched, had a different take. A live feed organized by opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was detained in Moscow before he could attend what the authorities said was an illegal protest, showed demonstrations in scores of cities from Vladivostok to St Petersburg and thousands of people converging on central Moscow. Other footage showed some protesters chanting  Russia without Putin  and  Down with the Tsar.    The competing versions of one day in Vladimir Putin's Russia highlight the battle being fought between state TV, where most Russians get their news, and the Internet, which Putin critic Navalny is using to try to unseat the veteran Russian leader.  Related CoverageMoscow's mayor calls anti-Putin protests 'dangerous provocation': InterfaxGermany criticizes arrests of Russian demonstratorsAhead of a presidential election in March which Putin is expected to contest and that Navalny hopes to run in, the battle for Russians' hearts and minds is escalating. On the face of it, the contest is one-sided. Polls show that Putin, who has dominated Russian political life for the last 17 years, will comfortably win if he stands, while a poll last month said only 1 percent would vote for Navalny.     Putin has enjoyed glowing Soviet-style coverage on state TV for almost two decades. Navalny barely gets a look in, and if he does it is inevitably a negative reference.  The Kremlin and top government officials deliberately try not to mention his name, and state TV largely ignored Navalny's last big protests, in March, too. Dmitry Kiselyov, anchor of Russia's main weekly TV news show  Vesti Nedeli,  explained then that his show had ignored the demonstrations, the largest since 2012, because he viewed Navalny as a corrupt political chancer. Riot police detain a demonstrator during an anti-corruption protest in central St. Petersburg, Russia, June 12, 2017.Anton Vaganov Our Western colleagues would have done exactly the same,  said Kiselyov. Handed a five-year suspended prison sentence in February for embezzlement, Navalny says he is not corrupt and that the conviction was politically-motivated to try to kill off his presidential campaign. The 41-year-old lawyer has been trying to use the Internet to circumvent what he says is a TV blackout. He has set up his own You Tube channel, which has over 300,000 subscribers, become a prolific social media poster, and regularly circulates clips of himself criticizing Putin, 64, whom he calls  the old man.  Partly funded by supporters' campaign contributions, his online push has had some success, particularly among school children and students, though his support base includes older people, too, who typically live in Russia's big cities.     Slideshow (3 Images)A video he made accusing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, a Putin ally, of living a luxury lifestyle far outstripping his official salary, has so far racked up more than 22 million online views. Medvedev said the allegations were nonsense. Navalny's detractors have gone online too.  A video likening him to Adolf Hitler has racked up over 2 million views on You Tube, as has a music video released ahead of Monday's protests by pop singer Alisa Voks who urged young fans to  stay out of politics  and do their homework instead. Businessman Alisher Usmanov, whom Navalny targeted in his Medvedev video, also used the Internet to hit back, making two videos of his own questioning Navalny's probity. Navalny's critics, including some other anti-Kremlin politicians, accuse him of holding dangerously nationalist views and of having denigrated migrants in the past. Navalny says he is able to talk to, and connect with, different parts of the electorate.       Serving out a 30-day jail sentence for his role in organizing Monday's protests, Navalny has mocked his opponents' efforts to use the Internet. He says his Medvedev video has been watched by more people than some TV programs, but for now he says state TV has the upper hand.  Right now TV is more effective,  he told supporters after his release from jail in April after the last round of protests.  But we're looking for new methods. We need to keep making videos.

Tens of thousands of displaced Syrians have found refuge in the northern province of Idlib, which borders Turkey. It is a stronghold of opposition forces, including Islamist-led rebel groups.  The situation in Idlib is very bad because many organizations have stopped their support,  said Dr Farida, the last obstetrician-gynecologist to be evacuated from rebel-held  eastern Aleppo to Idlib earlier this year. The doctors did not use their full names to protect their families from retaliation.  Many hospitals are closing because their supporters from outside are bored now because it's the seventh year of the revolution. Many of them don't want to come in anymore,  she said.

The biggest threat ... from their policy changes is scaring away the money as people think that the U.S. is not going to meet its humanitarian financial-assistance commitments so everyone else thinks we don't have to give as much either,  Dautzenberg said. Russia and Iran, which back the Syrian government, and opposition supporter Turkey, agreed in May to arrange and monitor  de-escalation zones  in Syria to ease the fighting. Government bombing of rebel areas in the north has eased, but the Syrian army and Iran-backed militia forces have escalated air raids against a rebel-held part of the southern city of Deraa, a possible prelude to a large-scale campaign to take full control of the city.

Bats said its decision to offer  market-on-close  (MOC) orders was a result of its customers complaining that fees on listings exchanges are too high. Trading firms Virtu Financial (VIRT.O) and PDQ Enterprises, as well as agency broker Clearpool, threw their support behind Bats in separate letters to the SEC.  We believe that the Bats Market Close will introduce much needed competition to the markets,  Clearpool said. The  time is ripe for exchanges to price their offerings more competitively and equitably,  it added.    If approved by the SEC, Bats would let market participants send in MOC orders to be pre-matched with other such orders 25 minutes before the 4 p.m. market close. The trades would be executed when the primary exchanges' closing prices were published. Orders that are not pre-matched could be sent to the primary exchanges' closing auctions. Knight said Bats was attempting to  free-ride  on the efforts and investments the listings exchanges have made toward their closing processes and that the proposal would undermine price discovery by diverting orders to Bats.    NYSE has also blasted the Bats proposal, saying that diverting trades away from closing auctions would add to volatility and distort prices.

Twenty parliamentarians, including former Finns Party leader Timo Soini and all other current Finns ministers, formed a new group called New Alternative. Prime Minister Juha Sipila, who had said he would break up his three-party coalition over the new Finns leaders, said he was ready to continue with the new group.  This is a very pleasing solution. We'll continue with the current ministers, and with the current government program... The situation will be closed in just one day,  Sipila told reporters. Sipila was on his way to hand over his resignation to President Sauli Niinisto when the split was announced, making a U-turn rush back. The split between hardliners and more moderate members of the nationalists was the latest in a series of blows to Europe's anti-establishment parties. On Sunday, France's National Front and Italy's 5-Star Movement failed in attempts to win legislative and civic elections, respectively. Last week, Britain's UK Independence Party saw its vote share collapse and won no seats in the British parliament. The crisis for Finland's government began on Saturday when  the Finns Party, previously the second-biggest parliamentary group, chose Jussi Halla-aho as its new leader and replaced three deputy leaders with anti-immigrant hardliners in a shift to the radical right. They will now be left out of government with 17 MPs, including two who have said they will quit. Simon Elo, chairman of the New Alternative group, said: Finnish Prime Minister Centre Party chairman Juha Sipilä and minister Sampo Terho (R) from the New Alternative attend a press conferance at the PM's official residence Kesäranta in Helsinki, Finland on June 13, 2017 where all parliament parties and their chairmen were summoned. PM Sipilä seeks new coalition as populist Finns Party split on Tuesday.   Jussi Nukari/Lehtikuva/via REUTERS This decision will likely ruin our political careers...but we are determined to do this...for the right reasons. Today we are not politicians, but we are doing this for the fatherland's sake,  said  With New Alternative, the coalition - including Sipila's Center Party and pro-EU National Coalition Party (NCP) - would have 106 of the parliament's 200 seats. Analysts had said a change in the coalition set-up could have derailed planned healthcare and local government reforms - central to Sipila's plan to balance public finances. Finland is recovering from a decade of stagnation. The government, now half-way of its four-year tenure, has sought to improve growth and curb public debt growth by cutting spending and reforming labor laws. Slideshow (7 Images)The central bank slightly increased its economic growth projections on Tuesday, but sees the pace declining from this year to 2019. Turning Finns Finland's Finns Party is transforming for the second time: It was founded in 1995 after the demise of agrarian populist party SMP, rising from obscurity with an anti-EU platform during the euro zone debt crisis, and expanding into the second-biggest parliamentary party in 2015 election. But after joining the government, its support dropped due to compromises in the coalition, increasing calls from the party grass root for tougher policy line. The newly-elected party leader Halla-aho had said he wants Finland to leave the European Union. In 2012 he was fined by Finland's Supreme Court in 2012 for comments on a blog that linked Islam to paedophilia and Somalis to theft. Speaking to reporters at the party office on his third day as party chairman, Halla-aho said he was disappointed by the split.  It is hard to believe that this sort of operation and betrayal of voters would happen... I could've not expected such a broad movement,  he said.

Italy is racing to get a deal on bailing out the two Veneto-based lenders to stem a deposit flight which has already forced them to raise 10 billion euros ($11 billion) in debt using a state guarantee.  A solution is now close , Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said in a statement, adding that  talks with European institutions are encouraging . Padoan said the solution would not entail losses for senior bondholders and depositors, triggering a rally in prices for the two banks' senior bonds. The yield on a March 2020 senior bond by Popolare di Vicenza fell to 7 percent on Tuesday after rising above 16 percent last week on concerns that the two banks would be wound down under rules that require investors in a bank to take a hit instead of taxpayers. Italy is seeking to exploit an exception to those rules so as to limit losses only to shareholders and junior bondholders because it fears a full 'bail in' of investors would damage confidence in a still frail banking sector.  The solution will not involve any form of bail-in,  Padoan said. A spokesman for EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager confirmed on Tuesday that the authorities were looking for a way to spare senior bondholders from losses, adding that depositors would not be hit. Europe has introduced bail-in rules to avoid a repeat of the costly bank bailouts seen during the financial crisis. Italy's government is working with its big banks UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo to get healthy Italian lenders to provide the 1.2 billion euros of private capital that the EC has demanded be raised to allow the rescue to go ahead. But Italian banks are unwilling to pump more money into the two Veneto rivals after investing 3.4 billion euros to save them from bankruptcy last year. On Tuesday UBI Banca's supervisory board chairman Andrea Moltrasio said Italy's fifth-largest bank had not been asked yet to take part in the rescue and had other priorities. However, he later said the bank would consider any proposal from Italy's Treasury should one materialise. A source familiar with the matter said Italy was still hoping to persuade the EU authorities to reduce the amount of private capital it wants to be raised to save the Veneto banks.

Bats said in May it planned to offer brokers a type of order that would give them the same closing prices derived from the closing auctions on Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange for stocks listed on those exchanges, but with lower execution fees. The move by Bats, which only lists ETFs and the stock of its parent company, CBOE Holdings (CBOE.O), would fragment the market close and result in less accurate pricing, Nasdaq said in a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated June 12.

In the midst of war, Hassino set out to find Syria's  Mr Gay  to send to an international beauty pageant. Hassino, a Syrian journalist and gay rights campaigner, saw LGBT people targeted by all sides in Syria's six-year-old conflict. And women disproportionately bore the brunt of the violence.  With the war, gender-based violence reached a peak,  said Hassino, 42.  Women suffered and the LGBT community as well. Any kind of gender expression is not possible during any war.   His quest to find Mr Gay Syria is now the subject of a documentary directed by Ayse Toprak, a Turkish journalist for whom Hassino worked as a fixer. The documentary, to be screened at the Sheffield documentary festival in Britain on Tuesday, depicts the lives of gay and bisexual Syrians in Istanbul as they compete for a place in the Mr Gay World competition. Not Just Islamic State When anti-government protests started in cities across Syria in 2011, Hassino hoped one of the outcomes would be more freedom for LGBT people. The uprising sparked hopes of more rights for minorities in a country where homosexuality is illegal, and people started coming out about their sexual orientation, talking about gay rights and women's rights, Hassino said. During the first few months of the civil war that ensued, it seemed as though Hassino's hopes had come true.  It had become easier for LGBT people because people weren't targeted systematically,  Hassino told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Berlin, where he now lives. But soon, they became a target for all groups involved in the conflict. In the most notorious example, rights groups have accused Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq of killing dozens of gay men by throwing them from buildings or stoning them. Gay men in Syria can face arrests,  honor killings  at the hands of family members, or murder by Islamic State and other militant groups. Beauty Contest Hassino, who had worked in Syria with Iraqi sexual and gender minorities, decided to shed light on the abuses by sending a Syrian to the Mr Gay World beauty pageant in Malta last year.  I had the idea of trying to create a media buzz around the situation which also highlights the Syrian LGBT refugee problem,  Hassino said. Even though the competition's winner, Husein, did not make it to the event because of visa restrictions, Hassino himself traveled to Malta to raise awareness of the persecution gay Syrians face. He says the film will document their experiences for future generations.  As a journalist, I think documentaries are more important than beauty pageants,  he said. Hassino now works with LGBT refugees in Germany - many of whom were targeted and beaten up in refugee camps. His hopes for a swift change in attitudes to LGBT people have ebbed away.  Maybe after the war ends we'll talk about rights. But not now.  Reporting by Anna Pujol-Mazzini @annapmzn, Editing by Ros Russell.

The U.S. Senate is expected to vote Tuesday on a resolution to block portions of a new, separate arms sale to Saudi Arabia, agreed during a visit there by President Donald Trump in May. Arms sales to Riyadh have become increasingly contentious in the U.S. Congress, where some lawmakers object that American weapons have contributed to widespread civilian casualties in a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. Republican Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, a Democrat, suspended the planned sale of precision-guided munitions in December because of concerns over civilian casualties in Yemen, where the civil war pits Iran-allied Houthi rebels against the government backed by a Saudi-led Arab coalition. Trump, however, has said he wants to encourage weapons sales as a way to create jobs in the United States. Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration had notified Congress about the start of deliveries on the 2015 sale. He said in a statement that Trump's decision was another reason for the Senate to disapprove the new sale.  We need to send a message to both the Trump Administration and the Saudis to work much harder to avoid civilian casualties, expedite humanitarian relief, and push for a peaceful end to the war through a negotiated political settlement,  Cardin said. Republicans control both chambers of Congress. A senior congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the notification was received last Thursday. The decision to move ahead with deliveries was first reported by Bloomberg. The 2015 sale included more than 8,000 Laser Guided Bombs for the Royal Saudi Air Force. The package also includes more than 10,000 general purpose bombs, and more than 5,000 tail kits used to inexpensively convert  dumb  bombs into laser or GPS-guided weapons. Some of the weapons systems included in the sale were made by Raytheon Co and Boeing Co. The arms deal announced in May was for $110 billion, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. Tuesday's Senate vote, which would block about $500 million of that sale, including precision-guided munitions and other offensive weapons, coincides with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other officials in Washington.

The rating for the senior unsecured notes is equivalent to the ratings assigned to AEL's existing senior unsecured notes, and it reflects standard notching based on Fitch's rating criteria. Fitch expects the proceeds from the debt issuance will be used to redeem USD400 million of outstanding senior notes in addition to the outstanding USD100 million term loan. As such, Fitch expects any increase in financial leverage at AEL to be temporary in nature. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch affirmed the ratings AEL and its insurance operating subsidiaries with a Stable Outlook on Oct. 6, 2016. The ratings reflect the company's low risk bond portfolio, continued solid operating results, strong capitalization, reasonable financial leverage and robust market position in the fixed indexed annuity market. The ratings also reflect AEL's above average exposure to interest rate risk and the lack of diversification in earnings and distribution. RATING SENSITIVITIES AEL's ability to achieve a higher rating is somewhat constrained by the company's limited diversity of earnings and cash flow given its heavy concentration in fixed indexed annuities. That said, factors that could lead to an upgrade include: --Enhanced capitalization with RBC above 350% on a sustained basis; --Financial leverage below 25%; --Continued stable or improved operating results and investment quality. Factors that may lead to a downgrade include: --A reduction in capital that results in a Prism score in the low range of 'Adequate' and an RBC ratio below 300%; --A sustained deterioration in operating results such that interest coverage is below 3x; --A significant increase in lapse/surrender rates; --Financial leverage greater than 40%. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following rating: American Equity Life Investment Holding Company --USD500 million senior unsecured notes due 2027 'BB+'. Fitch currently rates the AEL entities as follows: American Equity Life Investment Holding Company --Long-term IDR 'BBB-'; --6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2021 'BB+'; --Trust preferred securities 'BB-'.

The state pumped 1.05 million barrels of oil per day in April, up from 1.03 million bpd in March, according to data from North Dakota's Department of Mineral Resources, which reports on a two-month lag. Natural gas production rose 6 percent to 1.8 million cubic feet per day. North Dakota's oil well count hit 13,717 in April, an all-time high. The state's drilling rig count has been steadily rising, with the count on Friday at 55, 10 percent higher than in April. North Dakota regulators said in a statement they expect oil prices to be weak through at least October. OPEC members last month agreed to maintain their own production cuts, though rising output in states like North Dakota has been offsetting the cartel's moves.

Citi, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, has $45 billion in excess capital that could be returned to shareholders eventually, Gerspach said. Roughly $29 billion of that is in deferred tax assets that cannot be distributed immediately, while another $15 billion to $16 billion is sitting idle not earning profits, he said.  We absolutely have to ... begin to address that (excess capital) on which we're earning nothing,  Gerspach said at an investor event hosted by Morgan Stanley. However, like other big U.S. banks, Citigroup cannot return capital to shareholders through stock repurchases or dividends without permission from regulators. The Federal Reserve oversees an annual stress test whose outcome determines how they can use capital. Those results are scheduled to be released in the coming weeks. Another process known as  living wills,  which requires banks to submit plans for dismantling themselves without taxpayer support in case of a crisis, also affects how they manage their businesses. Citigroup is also focused on improving its resolution plan, Gerspach said. In the past, it has failed the stress test and its resolution plan has been rejected. To arrive at its capital return goals, Citigroup must improve in particular the performance of its consumer business, which is behind on its return targets but should start to see the benefit of prior investments in its credit card unit in the second half of 2017. Similar to its Wall Street peers, revenue from Citigroup's trading business is tracking down 12 to 13 percent in the second quarter relative to the comparable period a year earlier, due to low volatility, Gerspach said. His comments come a day after the Trump administration released a plan that would ease regulations on big banks. Citigroup is waiting for more details before drawing conclusions, said Gerspach, who gave a  brief read-through  of the report. A basketball game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors featuring star athlete LeBron James was more compelling, he said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-banks-conference-citigroup-idUSL1N1JA1BO"},

The eurosceptic, nationalist-minded governments in Poland and Hungary have refused to take in anyone under a plan agreed by a majority of EU leaders in 2015 to relocate migrants from frontline states Italy and Greece to help ease their burden. The Czech Republic, another ex-communist central European state, initially accepted 12 people but has since said it would not welcome more.  I regret to see that, despite our repeated calls to pledge to relocate, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland have not yet taken the necessary action,  the EU's migration chief, Dimitris Avramopoulos, told a news conference. He said the Commission was therefore launching so-called infringement procedures against the three, a way for the executive arm to take to task countries that fail to meet their obligations. It opens the way for months, even years, of legal wrangling before a top EU court could potentially impose fines.  From the political point of view, this action ... unnecessarily heats up political tensions, of which there are already too many in the European Union,  Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told state TV on Tuesday.  If necessary, Poland is ready to defend its legal arguments in court.  At stake in the dispute is the bloc's unity, already tested by Britain's unprecedented decision to leave, weak economies and higher support for eurosceptic parties across the EU. Beyond its borders, the EU is also facing a resurgent Russia and a tricky new relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump. But two years of arm-wrestling have so far produced no results and EU leaders are unlikely to be able to break the impasse when they discuss the matter next week in Brussels.  The Czech Republic does not agree with the system of relocation,  Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said in response.  With regard to the worsened security situation in Europe and dysfunctionality of the quota system, it will not participate in it.  In a separate legal battle on the matter, Hungary and Slovakia have challenged the relocation agreement in a top EU court, with an initial indication of the ruling due next month. Tarnished Unity The easterners vindicate their stance on asylum seekers by citing security concerns, noting a series of militant Islamist attacks in western Europe since late 2015. The bulk of refugees come from the mainly Muslim Middle East and North Africa. Their resistance to what they present as pressure from Brussels also earns them credit with eurosceptic voters at home. Many other EU states have also dragged their feet over taking in refugees, with fewer than 21,000 people relocated from Italy and Greece so far under a plan that had been due to cover 160,000 people. Wealthier EU states including Italy - now the main gateway to Europe for African migrants and refugees - have threatened to reduce generous development funds earmarked to help the easterners close the gap in living standards. The Commission is backed in the feud by Germany and Sweden, countries that took in most of the people who arrived in the EU. They have been mounting pressure on the vehement easterners over recent weeks and months but to no result so far. Brussels might have also been emboldened by Emmanuel Macron's presidential victory over eurosceptics and nationalists in France, which gave the EU a renewed confidence a year after Brexit thrust it into an existential crisis. After more than a million migrants and refugees reached the EU in 2015, mostly via Greece, Brussels sealed an accord with non EU-member Turkey that sharply cut the overall number of arrivals, though the deal was criticised by rights groups. Italy remains under pressure, but the EU treats the vast majority of the 64,000 people who made it to Italian shores this year as migrants - rather than refugees requiring legal protection - and does not plan to let them stay. The internal EU dispute over relocating asylum-seekers is a political one about values, as Avramopoulos stressed in his renewed appeal to the easterners.  Europe is not only about requesting funds or ensuring security. Europe is also about sharing difficult moments and challenges,  he said.

The move comes about a month after the Indian government gave the central bank greater power to deal with bad loans, including directing banks to initiate an insolvency resolution process in the case of a default under the bankruptcy code. The RBI said the 12 accounts constituted about 25 percent of the overall gross non-performing assets, adding it will direct lenders to begin insolvency proceedings around these accounts.  The committee narrowed the list to 12 by focusing on accounts owing more than 50 billion rupees ($777.2 million), where 60 percent or more of the loan had been already   classified as non-performing by banks as of March 31, 2016. Those 12 accounts were identified based on  objective, non-discretionary criterion  outlined by an internal advisory committee, the RBI said in a statement. The RBI, however, did not provide details about the loans or the banks holding them, which are typically not made public.    The banks have been given six months to finalize resolution plans for other non-performing accounts that do not currently qualify under this criteria.  If no resolution plan is hatched in that period then banks will have to begin insolvency proceedings on these accounts too, RBI said.          Doubts Remain The move marks India's latest attempt to tackle the record 9.64 trillion rupees ($150 billion) in stressed loans as of December, which have choked new credit and hurt economic growth.  Loans classified as non-performing amounted to more than 7 trillion rupees as of March, although final numbers have yet to come.  Sapan Gupta, a lawyer at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, called it  a positive and bold step , though some details would need to be worked out, including if a single bank or banks would jointly start the bankruptcy proceedings. Others expected RBI action include changes to guidelines for restructuring of stressed loans.  The intent of the government and the regulator is clear that this needs to be addressed in this financial year,  Gupta said. A senior banker at a large state-run lender declined to give details about the accounts identified by the RBI, saying it comprised  all the known cases  in media reports.   State-run lenders, who dominate India's banking sector, carry the bulk of the soured debt. Meanwhile, loans to sectors like infrastructure, power, iron and steel account for the biggest share of non-performing assets.  But challenges remain, including a largely untested insolvency process. Meanwhile, rating agencies have warned India will need to inject significantly more capital to tackle bad debt and meet upcoming global Basel III banking rules than the 700 billion rupees planned by New Delhi.

The jump in inflation to its highest in nearly four years in May tightened the squeeze on consumers facing the added worry of political uncertainty after an inconclusive parliamentary election and with Brexit talks set to start.  It also added to pressure on the Bank of England, even if it does not raise interest rates over the next three years, to hold off with any more injections of cash into the economy for fear of weakening the pound and fuelling inflation. Sterling traded near the $1.27 mark for most of morning trade in London.  It rose further after the BBC reported that Britain's ruling Conservative Party was likely to sign a deal on Wednesday to form a minority government after losing its parliamentary majority in last week's election. The pound last traded up 0.7 percent at $1.2753 and 87.82 pence per euro.  We did see a bit of an uptick on the back of the inflation numbers, but I still think economic data has taken a back seat to the political situation in terms of driving the pound at present,  said David Cheetham, chief markets analyst at retail broker XTB. The Times reported on Tuesday that May has accepted that voters' patience with austerity is at an end after seven years in which the government has focused on reducing a ballooning budget gap by cutting spending rather than raising taxes. That again may bode better for economic growth ahead, while further complicating the Bank of England's position. Having drifted earlier this year towards expecting the Bank of England's next move to be a rise in interest rates, short sterling contracts now show next to no chance of a hike in the next two years. 0#FSS:  The fundamentals (for sterling) still are not positive, they are negative,  said Citi strategist Josh O'Byrne.  But you have the fiscal angle or the BoE - I don't think these are going to come into play soon. But if they do, it would slow sterling's fall.

Fund managers such as T Rowe Price and Federated Investors, who were already overweight the sector, said they were buying beaten-down so-called 'FANG' stocks – Facebook, Amazon.com Inc , Netflix Inc and Google-parent Alphabet Inc - during a two-day selloff that marked the largest tech sector decline in nearly a year. Google, Apple and other large tech stocks rose modestly in morning trading Tuesday. Jeff Rottinghaus, portfolio manager of the T Rowe Price Large-Cap Core Equity fund, said he has been adding money to existing tech holdings such as Facebook and Amazon because they are positioned to continue to grow over the next few years regardless of the direction of the overall economy. With other secular growth stories hard to find,  It's getting to the point where you have to say, 'What else do you want me to own?'  he said, adding that these companies continue to be up significantly year-to-date despite recent declines. Analysts expect the S&P; 500 technology index to grow its earnings by 12.4 percent this year, better than the S&P; 500's 11.6-percent expected growth, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. About 40 percent of the stocks in the S&P; 500 information technology index rose on Monday, including Qualcomm Inc and International Business Machines Corp, which have lagged in 2017.  This tech selloff is a great buying opportunity,  said Navellier & Associates Chairman Louis Navellier, who bought shares of Micron Technology Inc, Applied Materials Inc , Arista Networks Inc and STMicroelectronics NV . In the 8-year-old bull market, investors have consistently been 'buying the dips,' taking advantage of brief pullbacks in prices, so large-cap stocks have not seen a 10-percent correction in well over a year. Although stocks are expensive by historical measures, bullish investors say they are justified by growth in earnings and the U.S. economy, while historically low bond yields are also making stocks more appealing. Comeback of the 'Trump Trade?' The stumble in tech comes a time when both mutual funds and hedge funds have taken outsized bets on the sector, helping push Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft to add a total $600 billion in market cap year-to-date. Tech stocks in the S&P; 500 rallied 21 percent for the year through June 2nd, with the largest companies accounting for 46 percent of the S&P; 500's 9-percent gain, according to Goldman Sachs. That rally sent some tech-heavy tech funds soaring. In May, Light Street Capital Management's $1.2-billion Halogen fund was up 11 percent and is up 42.6 percent this year through the end of May. The head of the fund, Glen Kacher, started his career at Tiger Management, Julian Robertson's famous fund. Yet concerns that fund managers had piled into the same stocks and stretched their valuations helped prompt a selloff that began Friday and continued through Monday, sapping 5 percent or more from companies such as Apple. Momentum-based technology stocks have  built a valuation air pocket underneath creating cause for pause,  Goldman Sachs wrote in a note Friday. Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York, said he saw the tech selloff as a sign that investors were feeling more confident that the Trump administration could pass infrastructure or tax legislation later this year. Last week's testimony by former FBI chief James Comey did not contain the sort of bombshell that investors had feared, Chiavarone said, prompting fund managers to rotate out of tech into sectors that have lagged.  It allowed folks to believe once again that Congress isn't going to be bogged down in a massive impeachment effort and could get some policy work done,  he said, which would benefit energy and financial stocks that initially rallied following Trump's unexpected victory but lost their gains following Inauguration Day.

The jump in inflation to its highest in nearly four years in May tightened the squeeze on consumers facing the added worry of political uncertainty after an inconclusive parliamentary election and with Brexit talks set to start.  It also added to pressure on the Bank of England, even if it does not raise interest rates over the next three years, to hold off with any more injections of cash into the economy for fear of weakening the pound and fuelling inflation. Sterling traded near the $1.27 mark for most of morning trade in London.  It rose further after the BBC reported that Britain's ruling Conservative Party was likely to sign a deal on Wednesday to form a minority government after losing its parliamentary majority in last week's election. The pound last traded up 0.7 percent at $1.2753 and 87.82 pence per euro.  We did see a bit of an uptick on the back of the inflation numbers, but I still think economic data has taken a back seat to the political situation in terms of driving the pound at present,  said David Cheetham, chief markets analyst at retail broker XTB. The Times reported on Tuesday that May has accepted that voters' patience with austerity is at an end after seven years in which the government has focused on reducing a ballooning budget gap by cutting spending rather than raising taxes. That again may bode better for economic growth ahead, while further complicating the Bank of England's position. Having drifted earlier this year towards expecting the Bank of England's next move to be a rise in interest rates, short sterling contracts now show next to no chance of a hike in the next two years. 0#FSS:  The fundamentals (for sterling) still are not positive, they are negative,  said Citi strategist Josh O'Byrne.  But you have the fiscal angle or the BoE - I don't think these are going to come into play soon. But if they do, it would slow sterling's fall.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium's 1,300 truck trailers.  Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.      Time is everything in our world,  she said.  Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.   Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen's strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.  Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary's software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.  BlackBerry's stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.  Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.  Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry's biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.  Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.   Hope and Promise   The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.  Radar  is not a unique and earth-shattering product,  said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.  That's why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.   It's not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,  said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant.  It is all about hope and promise.   Trailers sit in a lot equipped with  BlackBerry Radar  boxes, that perform a fleet-tracking service which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of truck trailers, at the Titanium Transportation trucking firm in Bolton, Ontario, Canada on June 7, 2017. Picture taken on June 7, 2017.Mark BlinchAnd yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.  Since taking the company's helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.  He also bolstered the company's ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.  With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.  BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry's sales by 2020.  Slideshow (8 Images)Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.   It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,  he said.  Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.   BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.  On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.  AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.  The company expands Radar's functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.  The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.  Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.  Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

The S&P; 500 technology sector rose 0.71 percent, recovering from its biggest two-day decline in nearly a year on Monday, and topped the list of gainers among the 11 major S&P; indexes. Shares of Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple , which were hit hard by the rout, powered the technology index on Tuesday.  The selloff in tech probably was a bit further than people expected, so there is some bargain hunting back into that sector,  said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management.  I think the sector rotation could go on for a while.  Investors are also likely to stay away from making big bets ahead of a near-certain interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Traders have priced in a 94 percent chance of the Fed raising rates after its two-day meeting that starts on Tuesday. Investors are also looking for more details on the central bank's plans to trim its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The Fed is expected to release its decision at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) on Wednesday followed by a press conference by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. At 12:41 p.m. ET (1641 GMT), the Dow was up 84.08 points, or 0.4 percent, at 21,319.75, the S&P; 500 was up 8.55 points, or 0.35 percent, at 2,437.94 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 37.33 points, or 0.6 percent, at 6,212.80. Six of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, while defensive plays like utilities, telecom services and consumer staples were lower. Financials rose 0.51 percent, helped by gains in big banks after the U.S. Treasury Department announced a plan to make sweeping changes to banking regulations on Monday. The department proposed to reduce trading restrictions that the banks face, ease their annual stress tests, and curb the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  I think investors are unsure of real regulatory changes but this is enough talk to keep them interested,  Meckler said. Amazon.com rose 0.7 percent, after recording losses for the past two days, and gave the biggest boost to the consumer discretionary index. Restaurant chain operator Cheesecake Factory was down nearly 10 percent at $52.61 after it warned of a decline in comparable store sales in the current quarter. Tesla was up 2.5 percent at $368.17 after Berenberg raised its rating on the stock to  buy  from  hold . Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,847 to 993. On the Nasdaq, 1,731 issues rose and 1,060 fell.

The production rise comes mainly from the oil sands and is an increase of 32.5 percent from last year's output of 3.85 million bpd and a 4 percent increase from last year's forecast of 4.9 million bpd by 2030, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) said in an annual report. The last time CAPP increased its forecast for 2030 was in 2013, when it predicted 6.7 million bpd of production, up from 6.2 million bpd predicted in 2012. Such a boost in production highlights the need for pipelines for the largely landlocked industry, whose a lack of export routes depresses prices, CAPP said.  We have been operating in a pipeline world where we have been at full capacity,  CAPP President Tim McMillan said in a conference call.  It's like a freeway that's always in gridlock.  Canada has the world's third-largest crude reserves, but bids to build new pipelines have faced fierce environmental opposition. Major projects at various stages of approval include Enbridge Inc's Line 3 replacement, Kinder Morgan Inc's Trans Mountain expansion and TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL and Energy East. McMillan said the industry needs all of them. Also on Tuesday, the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors forecasted 6,842 wells to be drilled this year, a 2,177 increase from its previous prediction, citing price stabilization. The association, however, warned about delays in the Trans Mountain expansion's coming online due to a vow to block it by the British Columbia province's effective incoming government. CAPP's report, based on surveys of its members, said Canada’s oil industry faces challenges including uncertainty related to climate change policies, potential U.S. protectionist measures and possibly laxer regulations in the United States. Capital spending in the Canadian oil sands is expected to decline for the third consecutive year to $15 billion in 2017, down from $34 billion in 2014, according to the report. But the impact of the drop on investment in the oil patch, where project have years-long cycles, would not be seen until beyond 2020, when growth is expected to slow, McMillan said. Production from oil sands in the Canadian province of Alberta, the heart of Canada's energy sector, will reach 3.7 million bpd by 2030, CAPP said.

It was his 17th multi-hit game of the season and he has four homers in his last seven games. He has five RBIs in his last two games and picked up the third assist of the season and his career. RHP Tanner Hauck was selected by the Red Sox with the 24th pick of the draft Monday night. The hard-throwing Hauck, who has hit 98 mph on the gun and usually throws between 92 and 96, was 4-7 with a 3.33 ERA for the University of Missouri this season -- striking out 95 and walking 24 in 24 2/3 innings.

RF Mookie Betts doubled his first three times up and then led off the seventh inning with a single Monday night, finishing 4-for-5 with an intentional walk and two fine fielding plays to contribute to the win. It was his third four-hit game of the season and the three doubles were a career high. He leads the American League with 46 doubles (22 this season) since the start of 2016 and leads the AL with seven multi-extra-base hit games. DH Hanley Ramirez hit a long home run -- his ninth homer of the season, tied for the team lead and also tying the game in the eighth inning. He has 10 homers in his last 21 games against the Phillies and has reached base in his last 22 home games, the longest active American League streak. RHP Rick Porcello, who came in having allowed more hits (104) than any pitcher in baseball, gave up 10 more, along with five runs, in six innings at Fenway Park Monday night.

Through Monday, his ERA is 4.67 and he has allowed a major league-worst 114 hits; his record stands at 3-9 (he was 22-4 in 2016). Hitters are batting .401 off him on balls put in play, but he avoided his ninth loss of the season when Hanley Ramirez tied the game 5-5 in the eighth inning. Porcello heard boos during a four-run fourth inning but didn't give up another run until after his team tied the game 4-4.  He's not all the way there yet, obviously with the number of hits he surrendered here tonight,  said manager John Farrell.  But while he's working at it to get back to being a little bit more refined, we picked him up offensively here tonight.  LHP David Price makes his first home start of the season -- and his first since his obscenity laced tirade aimed at the media in New York last week. Price was hammered by the Yankees a night after the outburst, and met with manager John Farrell when the team got back into Boston. He is 1-1 this season and also 1-1 against the Phillies lifetime. He was 9-3 with a 4.11 ERA at Fenway last year and is 15-4 with a 3.26 lifetime at Fenway. 3B Pablo Sandoval, struggling both offensively and defensively, sat against a right-handed pitcher for the second straight game Monday night.

Pablo will be on the field,  manager John Farrell said before Monday night's game. Sandoval pinch hit in the eighth inning and flied out to right, hearing a smattering of boos. He then made a diving play to start the ninth inning but booted a grounder with two out, but singled opening the bottom of the 11th -- leading to the winning run.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-redsox-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6DHWLQ73"},

Peterson, a junior at the University of Oregon, finished 11-4 with a 2.51 ERA and 140 strikeouts -- the most in a single season in school history -- and just 15 walks over 100 1/3 innings. He ranked second in the nation in both wins and strikeouts. Peterson is 19-15 with a 3.44 ERA and 282 strikeouts over 256 2/3 innings in three seasons at Oregon. Presuming he signs with the Mets, Peterson will likely begin his professional career at Class A Brooklyn. RHP Zack Wheeler will look to continue his resurgent comeback season Tuesday night, when he takes the mound for the Mets in the middle game of a three-game series against the Chicago Cubs at Citi Field. Wheeler didn't factor into the decision in his most recent start last Wednesday, when he gave up one run on six hits and three walks while striking out five over seven innings as the Mets beat the Texas Rangers. He exited with a 3-1 lead, which the Mets gave up in the eighth inning. It was the third no-decision this season for Wheeler in which he left in line for the win before the bullpen surrendered the lead. Wheeler, who missed the previous two seasons while recovering from Tommy John surgery, has given up two runs or less in seven of his last nine starts, a stretch in which he has compiled a 2.72 ERA while lowering his overall ERA from 7.45 to a season-low 3.45. He is 1-0 with a 1.35 ERA in two career starts against the Cubs. LF Yoenis Cespedes (left heel) exited following the fifth inning Monday night, when the Mets beat the Cubs 6-1. Cespedes, who was activated from the disabled list Saturday after missing 37 games due to left hamstring and right quad injuries, appeared to be moving slow as he walked to the plate for all three of his at-bats and ran gingerly to first base each time. Manager Terry Collins visited Cespedes in left field before the top of the fifth but Cespedes said the heel injury is a chronic one that often goes away. However, Cespedes admitted in the bottom of the inning that the injury was still bothering him, though he was able to convince Collins to let him bat one more time before being lifted for OF Juan Lagares. Both Cespedes and Collins said they were confident Cespedes would be in the lineup Tuesday. Cespedes went 1-for-3 Monday and is now batting .278 with seven homers and 14 RBIs in 21 games this season. RHP Jacob deGrom threw his second career complete game Monday night, when he twirled a five-hitter to lead the Mets past the Cubs, 6-1. DeGrom walked four and struck out six while throwing 116 pitches, the fifth most of his career. He carried a shutout into the seventh, when he gave up a two-out homer to Cubs SS Addison Russell, but bounced back by retiring the final seven batters he faced. The gem -- the Mets' first complete game since deGrom threw a one-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies last July 17 -- came after deGrom gave up 15 runs over just eight innings in his previous two starts. DeGrom is 5-3 with a 4.33 ERA and 100 strikeouts over 81 innings in 13 starts this season. OF Michael Conforto (stiff back) did not play Monday, when the Mets beat the Cubs, 6-1. Manager Terry Collins said Conforto told him earlier Monday that his back began to stiffen up following a doubleheader against the Atlanta Braves on Saturday. Conforto started Sunday's series finale but continued to feel stiff on the flight home. Collins said following the game that Conforto wasn't available as a pinch-hitter because the stiffness was lingering. Conforto is day-to-day. He is batting .293 with 14 homers and 36 RBIs in 57 games this season. SS Asdrubal Cabrera atoned for his recent struggles in the field Monday night, when he hit a pair of solo homers to help the Mets to a 6-1 win over the Cubs. Cabrera committed his third error in the last three games in the second inning, when he bumped into 3B Jose Reyes while they settled under a pop-up by Cubs RF Jason Heyward. The ball bounced off Cabrera's glove and he was charged with a two-base error, though the Cubs were not able to score that inning. Cabrera then led off the bottom of the second with a homer and added another homer leading off the fourth. It was the sixth multi-homer game for Cabrera and his third since joining the Mets prior to last season. Cabrera is batting .244 with six homers and 20 RBIs in 49 games this season.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mets-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6DHWLQ6U"},

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium's 1,300 truck trailers.  Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.      Time is everything in our world,  she said.  Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.   Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen's strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.  Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary's software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.  BlackBerry's stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.  Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.  Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry's biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.  Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.   Hope and Promise   The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.  Radar  is not a unique and earth-shattering product,  said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.  That's why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.   It's not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,  said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant.  It is all about hope and promise.   Trailers sit in a lot equipped with  BlackBerry Radar  boxes, that perform a fleet-tracking service which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of truck trailers, at the Titanium Transportation trucking firm in Bolton, Ontario, Canada on June 7, 2017. Picture taken on June 7, 2017.Mark BlinchAnd yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.  Since taking the company's helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.  He also bolstered the company's ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.  With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.  BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry's sales by 2020.  Slideshow (8 Images)Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.   It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,  he said.  Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.   BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.  On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.  AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.  The company expands Radar's functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.  The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.  Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.  Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.   The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,  said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company's second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.   Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,  said Rivett.

The RWN reflects New Look's deteriorating operating performance, our expectation of falling consumer confidence in the UK, rising input prices following the fall in sterling, economic uncertainty following the recent general election, exacerbated by heavy competition from pure online players. The RWN for the IDR and also the ratings for the instruments will be resolved following full review with management on their 2018 business strategy. The stabilisation of the Outlook will be subject to our confidence in management's ability to turn around their operating performance, maintain their business profile, remain competitive in a rapidly changing environment and improve their financial and liquidity profile back within our negative sensitivity guidance. KEY RATING DRIVERS Exposure to UK Uncertainty: Fitch expects continuing pressure on UK like-for-like (LFL) sales as the UK's exit from the EU which continues to weigh on consumer spending. New Look's significant exposure to the UK, which together with rising input prices following the fall in sterling, economic uncertainty following the recent general election, intense competition and the significant challenges ahead over the coming years supports our RWN for the company's rating. Eroding Margins: In our base case, we have revised our expectations for EBITDA margin to only slightly recover to 11.9% in the financial year to March (FY18) from 10.4% in FY17. We have also revised downwards our view on the business model to 'Intact' from 'Sustainable' given the structural change in the fast fashion sector in the UK. We expect margins to remain under pressure, mainly due to the heavy discounting in the UK, in addition to sterling's depreciation against the US dollar, which will further impact pricing and competitiveness when New Look's legacy hedges roll off during 2017. This should be partially offset by growth in e-commerce channels. New Look experienced a significantly poor fourth quarter in FY17, with EBITDA down GBP22 million to GBP151million from our full-year Fitch forecast of GBP173million. Of the GBP 22million decline that occurred in the last quarter, about GBP10 million is related to product (fashion) risk in the UK, and GBP 15m to discounting due to the prevalence of promotions as well as increased distribution, marketing and e-commerce costs related to organic growth. If this trend continues, this could put further pressure on the ratings. Weaker Free Cash Flow; Credit Metrics: Free cash flow (FCF) has become negative and is not expected to recover to previous levels in the near term. This has reduced liquidity although it remains manageable. We expect the FCF margin to be negative to reach -0.3% in FY18 and -1.2% in FY19. FFO adjusted leverage has increased to 8.5x in FY17, which is 1.0x higher than our previous Fitch forecast and in the absence of a significant improvement in operating performance, we only expect slight deleveraging to 8.0x by FY19, which is just on our 8.0x negative guidance. New Look's leverage increased following a refinancing in 2015 from 7.1x, this reduced headroom under its negative guidance. Financial flexibility has also weakened slightly with FFO fixed charge cover falling to 1.2x in FY17, although it is expected to recover to around 1.3x by FY19. DERIVATION SUMMARY New Look is a fast-fashion multichannel retailer operating in the value segment of the UK clothing and footwear market for women, men and teenage girls. The group also generates around 20% of revenue internationally. The e-commerce platform is a key differentiating factor relative to other sector peers such as Financiere IKKS S.A.S (CCC), which helps to offset weaknesses in the domestic UK retail market to which it is heavily exposed. No Country Ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects impacts the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - group revenue growth declining -0.4% for FY18, driven by continued challenging conditions in the UK, pricing pressure, intense competition, partially offset by growth in ecommerce and international (China) - EBITDA margin recovering to 11.9% in FY18 - capex steady at 4.5% of sales in FY18 - no dividend payments or extraordinary non-recurring cash outflow RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Improvement in the business model through successful expansion in China, increasing diversification and scale, and a proven track record of strategy implementation over the medium term, leading to EBITDA margin at or above 15% - FFO adjusted leverage consistently below 6.5x - FFO fixed charge cover trending towards 2.0x - FCF margin sustainably above 2% Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Failure to overcome profit margin pressures, FX impact, loss of market share and weaker consumer confidence in the UK leading to EBITDA margin below 10% (FY17: 10.4%) - FFO adjusted leverage above 8.0x on a sustained basis (FY17: 8.5x) - FFO fixed charge cover below 1.2x (FY17: 1.2x) - Negative FCF generation (which Fitch defines after dividends) eroding the group's liquidity buffer (FY17: Neg) LIQUIDITY Weaker Liquidity: Cash balances have declined, lowering the overall liquidity buffer. New Look had GBP72 million of cash at FYE17, together with access to a GBP 100million undrawn RCF and a bilateral GBP5 million overdraft. There is a springing covenant under the RCF when more than 25% of its total commitment is drawn, requiring net leverage to be below 8.7x at FYE18 (and below higher levels at the end of the first, second and third quarters) against our estimate of 7.9x at FYE18. Working capital peak to trough is in the range of GBP50-60 million, for which we set aside GBP50 million as restricted cash. Refinancing risk has risen although there are no significant debt maturities of the notes until 2022.

The central bank is scheduled to release its decision at 2 p.m EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is due to hold a press conference at 2:30 pm EDT (1830 GMT).  The expectation of a rate hike...is widely held, and has been reinforced by the most recent round of Fed communications,  said Michael Feroli, an economist with J.P. Morgan. Economists polled by Reuters overwhelmingly see the Fed raising its benchmark rate to a target range of 1.00 to 1.25 percent this week. The Fed embarked on its first tightening cycle in more than a decade in December 2015. A quarter percentage point interest rate rise on Wednesday would be the second nudge upwards this year following a similar move in March. Since then, the unemployment rate has fallen to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent and economic growth appears to have reaccelerated following a lackluster first quarter. However, other indicators of the economy's health have been more mixed. The Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation has retreated to 1.5 percent from 1.8 percent earlier in 2017 and investors are growing increasingly doubtful policymakers will be able to stick to their anticipated pace of tightening of three interest rate rises this year and next.  There are also growing doubts on the size and scope of fiscal stimulus the Trump administration may inject into the U.S. economy with campaign promises on tax reform, financial regulation rollbacks and infrastructure spending either still on the drawing board or facing hurdles in Congress. A police officer keeps watch in front of the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington October 12, 2016.Kevin LamarqueBalance Sheet in Focus Fed policymakers' confidence in their outlook will be on show on Wednesday when they release their latest set of quarterly projections on growth, unemployment and inflation as well as their expected rate hike path.  Few economists expect major changes in the Fed's overall forecasts this time around, although the extent of jitters on inflation moving away from the Fed's 2 percent goal will likely be reflected at an individual level. Markets are, however, increasingly anxious for the Fed to give a clearer steer on the timing and details of its previously announced plan to reduce this year its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the financial crisis to help keep rates low and bolster the economy.  If the Fed is serious about reducing the size of its balance sheet this year and wishes to communicate those plans well in advance, it is running out of time to do so,  said Michael Pearce, an economist with Capital Economics. More detail could come as part of the policy statement or during Yellen's press conference. The central bank used the minutes of its last policy meeting to flag up a plan that would feature halting reinvestments of ever-larger amounts of maturing securities. Under the proposal, a limit would be set on the amount of securities allowed to fall off the balance sheet every month. Initially, the cap would be set at a low level, but every three months the Fed would raise it, allowing deeper cuts to its holdings. The Fed has yet to indicate the size of the monthly caps or their quarterly increases. After this week's meeting, policymakers meet four more times this year, with the Fed seen actually reducing its holdings either in September or December.

A six month study by non-profit National Adivasi Solidarity Council, a network for indigenous peoples' welfare, has identified bondage in over 30 farms and plantations in a 15 km (9 mile) radius of the dam in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.  Most of the families were displaced during the construction of the Aliyar dam and reservoir between 1959 and 1969,  said Krishnan Kandasamy, of the council.  They lost their homes, were never compensated and were practically driven into bondage. The state has conveniently forgotten them.  The study states that those in bondage are from the Malasar tribal community and most families lost their land, home and livelihoods during the construction of the dam and reservoir. The research teams gained access to the farms on the pretext of conducting medical camps or in some instances saying they were lost, and identified more than 50 families, including 73 children living in debt bondage with no access to schools.  They are not paid minimum wages and do not enjoy basic rights such as the freedom of movement, the freedom of choice of employment and lack of right to education for their children,  the study said. Most of the families had been trapped in bondage to pay off  debts that have come down through generations, it added. India banned bonded labor in 1976, but it remains widespread, with millions from the marginalized Dalit and tribal communities working in fields, brick kilns, rice mills, brothels or as domestic workers to pay off debts. The new report suggests that they may be more than 1,000 laborers still trapped in the coconut plantations, mango groves and other farms around the town of Pollachi in Tamil Nadu. Security guards on the plantations monitor the laborers and any attempts to escape or make complaints are dealt with brutally, the report said. In a letter to India's National Human Rights Commission on May 29, Kandasamy has asked that the Tamil Nadu government be directed to rescue the workers and rehabilitate them. The commission has acknowledged the complaint and said they were looking into the report.   These people have suffered for decades. It has to stop immediately,  Kandasamy said.

The price range for the initial public offering was set on Monday between 3.90 euros and 4.90 euros. AIB plans to raise up to 3.3 billion euros ($3.70 billion) when it sells a 25 percent stake on the Dublin and London stock markets later this month. The float is expected to be one of the largest IPOs on Britain's main stock market in two decades and is seen as a test of whether the Irish banking sector has redeemed itself in the eyes of investors. Dublin rescued the bank in a 21 billion euro taxpayer bailout that began in early 2009 and the government has been considering cashing out some of its 99.9 percent stake since last year. The landmark deal is also a test of investor appetite in volatile conditions for IPOs. London has had few large listings this year and there were a string of cancelled flotations in the second half of 2016 after Britain's vote to leave the European Union. The final offer price for AIB, which returned to profit three years ago, is expected to be announced on or around June 23. ($1 = 0.8931 euros) (Reporting by Dasha Afanasieva.

The deal would be by far the biggest acquisition by a Chinese company in the U.S. senior care sector, and a key test of the U.S. government's openness to Chinese investments in key healthcare services industries. Brookdale has entered exclusive negotiations with Zhonghong after it made an offer of around $3 billion, the sources said on Tuesday. Brookdale had received offers from other parties that valued it substantially below that, the sources added. Negotiations are ongoing and no deal is certain, the sources said. Brookdale needs to be convinced that a deal with Zhonghong would be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes corporate acquisitions for potential national security risks, according to the sources. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Brookdale and Zhonghong did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Brookdale shares jumped as much as 6 percent on the news, and were up 0.5 percent at $14.62 in afternoon trade in New York on Tuesday, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.7 billion. Chinese acquisitions of U.S. companies have slowed down this year, amid tighter Chinese controls on getting money out of the country and uncertainty over the stance of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration toward such deals. Trump has criticized Chinese trade practices, but is also looking for Chinese cooperation in tackling North Korea's nuclear ambitions. There is also little precedent indicating how CFIUS would view a Chinese investment in senior living. Vacancies left in senior positions at several government agencies, almost five months after Trump's inauguration, have caused delays and fueled uncertainty in the CFIUS review system. Founded in 1993, Zhonghong is a diversified property investment company. Lat year it acquired Abercrombie & Kent, an international luxury and adventure tour operator.  Last month, Zhonghong completed the acquisition of a 21 percent stake in SeaWorld, a U.S. theme park operator, from private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N). Headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, Brookdale provides senior living facilities ranging from independent to assistant living, as well as luxury retirement communities.  The company's stock has struggled in the wake of its $2.8 billion acquisition of Emeritus Senior Living in 2014, which proved a drag on financial performance as a result of employee churn and falling occupancy. Brookdale has also came under pressure from activist investor Land and Buildings.

A six month study by non-profit National Adivasi Solidarity Council, a network for indigenous peoples' welfare, has identified bondage in over 30 farms and plantations in a 15 km (9 mile) radius of the dam in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.  Most of the families were displaced during the construction of the Aliyar dam and reservoir between 1959 and 1969,  said Krishnan Kandasamy, of the council.  They lost their homes, were never compensated and were practically driven into bondage. The state has conveniently forgotten them.  The study states that those in bondage are from the Malasar tribal community and most families lost their land, home and livelihoods during the construction of the dam and reservoir. The research teams gained access to the farms on the pretext of conducting medical camps or in some instances saying they were lost, and identified more than 50 families, including 73 children living in debt bondage with no access to schools.  They are not paid minimum wages and do not enjoy basic rights such as the freedom of movement, the freedom of choice of employment and lack of right to education for their children,  the study said. Most of the families had been trapped in bondage to pay off  debts that have come down through generations, it added. India banned bonded labor in 1976, but it remains widespread, with millions from the marginalized Dalit and tribal communities working in fields, brick kilns, rice mills, brothels or as domestic workers to pay off debts. The new report suggests that they may be more than 1,000 laborers still trapped in the coconut plantations, mango groves and other farms around the town of Pollachi in Tamil Nadu. Security guards on the plantations monitor the laborers and any attempts to escape or make complaints are dealt with brutally, the report said. In a letter to India's National Human Rights Commission on May 29, Kandasamy has asked that the Tamil Nadu government be directed to rescue the workers and rehabilitate them. The commission has acknowledged the complaint and said they were looking into the report.   These people have suffered for decades. It has to stop immediately,  Kandasamy said.

The statement came after authorities in eastern Libya threatened to block operations by Glencore, in which Qatar Holding owns a stake and which has a contract with the NOC to lift oil from the eastern port of Marsa al-Hariga. Any such move would put at risk a partial recovery in Libyan oil output, which recently rose above 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) for the first time since 2014. Libya has been split for three years between competing governments and armed factions based in Tripoli and the east. Factions based in the east have repeatedly tried to sell oil independently through a parallel institution in Benghazi. They have been prevented from doing so by U.N. Security Council resolutions that recognise the NOC in Tripoli as the sole legitimate oil exporter. Some groups have also blockaded ports and other oil facilities. Despite past threats from eastern officials to disrupt production, Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), which is aligned with the eastern government and parliament, has kept major ports open in recent months for the Tripoli NOC. But after Arab states including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates cut ties with Qatar last week, east Libyan factions have stepped up their rhetoric against opponents in the west. The eastern camp has long been backed by Egypt and the UAE, while accusing Qatar of supporting Islamist-leaning rivals based in west Libya. A statement issued on Sunday by the eastern government called for  immediate measures by all oil companies to stop any kind of dealing  with Glencore. Days earlier, the eastern parliament said the NOC  had to review and cancel its contracts with some companies wholly or partly owned by the state of Qatar and the leaders of the global organization of the Muslim Brotherhood . Glencore, which since 2015 has been the only company able to buy Sarir and Messla crude output directly from the NOC, declined to comment. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said he had warned the head of the eastern government, Abdullah al-Thinni, against any new port blockades.  We respect the Libyan National Army General Command for its responsible opposition to port blockades,  Sanalla wrote, according to the NOC statement.  I hope you will take notice of their wise position on this matter.  He said contracts signed by Naji al-Maghrabi, who Thinni appointed to head the parallel NOC,  were with companies NOC would not accept as counterparties, and could cost Libya billions of dollars in lost revenue if they were ever implemented . Maghrabi told Reuters that any contracts signed  were marketing contracts only , and that the eastern government and NOC Benghazi were not demanding any halt to exports. OPEC on Tuesday said a long-awaited rebalancing of the global oil market was under way at a  slower pace  and reported that its own output in May jumped due to gains in nations exempt from a pact to reduce supply. In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said its own output rose by 336,000 barrels per day (bpd) in May to 32.14 million bpd led by Nigeria and Libya, two members exempt from the supply reduction deal.

Stocks trod water as falls in gold shares and Brait SE curbed further gains. At 1528 GMT, the rand traded 0.35 percent firmer at 12.7750 per dollar compared to close of 12.8200 overnight in New York.  Despite a backdrop of decline and downgrades from all of the ratings agencies, the rand continues to trade resiliently, technically the current levels would suggest the potential for a move toward the 12.5000 level, although local fundamentals do not appear to support that scenario,  Nedbank analysts wrote in a note. The rand has gained around 1.5 percent since Moody's downgraded the country's credit by one notch on Friday with a negative outlook, which still left it as the only major agency to rate South Africa as investment grade. Globally, traders eyed the start of a two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. With the bank widely expected to raise interest rates, investors' focus will be on any fresh hints on the pace of hikes in the months to come, and its assessment of the economy and outlook on inflation. In Britain, investors were still cautious after the shock outcome of last week's election, in which voters denied any party a parliamentary majority. Government bonds weakened, with the yield for the benchmark instrument due in 2026 adding 3.5 basis points to 8.44 percent. On the bourse, the benchmark Top-40 index rising 0.21 percent to 45,264, while the broader All-share index ticked up 0.12 percent at 51,625. The biggest faller on the bourse, Brait SE, reported a 43 percent fall in full-year net asset value (NAV), weighed down by unfavourable currency movements and a weak showing at New Look, its British no-frills clothing chain.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium's 1,300 truck trailers. Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.  Time is everything in our world,  she said.  Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.  Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen's strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses. Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary's software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking. BlackBerry's stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion. Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings. Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry's biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March. Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.  Hope and Promise  The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman, Tomtom NV , Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc. Radar  is not a unique and earth-shattering product,  said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C; Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations. That's why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.  It's not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,  said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant.  It is all about hope and promise.  And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business. Since taking the company's helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar. He also bolstered the company's ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books. With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty. BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry's sales by 2020. Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.  It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,  he said.  Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.  BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year. On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer. AT&T; will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said. The company expands Radar's functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said. The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies. Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that Radar could generate annual revenue of $80 million by fiscal 2020, assuming that BlackBerry garners 10 percent of an addressable market of 8 million trailers. Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.  The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,  said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company's second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.  Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,  said Rivett.

The goal of the research is to prevent skin cancers by darkening the pigmentation of people's skin, senior author Dr. David Fisher told Reuters Health.   Very light skin and a very poor ability to tan correlates with a very high probability of developing cancer,  said Fisher, who is chief of the dermatology service at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Darker skin may block harmful UV radiation, Fisher said. So it's possible that darkening the skin's pigmentation might help neutralize the risk associated with genes for light-colored hair and fair skin. A decade ago, Fisher's team found a way to change the pigmentation of skin cells in mice from very fair to dark, which protected their cells from the type of UV damage that can lead to skin cancer.  Unfortunately, the topical agent that worked to darken the skin of mice didn't work as effectively on thicker human skin. Since then, the researchers have been trying to find alternative ways to achieve the same goal in humans, Fisher said. Eventually, they identified enzymes - called small-molecule salt-inducible kinases - that help control pigmentation in a cell. When the researchers applied the enzymes onto mice and samples of human skin in a lab, both the mice and the human skin turned increasingly dark as more enzymes were applied, according to the study published in Cell Reports. Fisher said the darkened skin responded like a normal tan, but without the damage seen with UV radiation. The darker pigment - the melanin -  won’t go away until the cells mature, die and fall of the surface,  he said. The enzyme solution used in the study is far from being available at local pharmacies, however.  As in anything that’s a new strategy, this needs toxicity testing to know it’s safe before going into man and all sorts of clinical trials,  said Fisher. A drug that darkens pigmentation may have uses beyond the theoretical protection against skin cancer, including to cosmetically darken skin among people with other medical conditions, said Dr. Jonathan Zippin, of Weill Cornell Medicine's Department of Dermatology in New York.  There is a clear cosmetic application,  he told Reuters Health.  If you want to prove that you’ve improved skin cancer risk, you've got to do that study and that’s going to require time,  he noted.  There is a limited number of drugs available that can effectively elevate pigmentation in a safe way,  said Zippin, who was not involved with the new research.  So this is exciting in the sense that it could be one such drug to fill that niche.  Fisher is focused on developing a product that will protect against skin cancers.  There is such a prevention opportunity that is missed right now,  he said. SOURCE: bit.ly/2swRnn6 Cell Reports, online June 13, 2017. Story refiles to update link in Source line at the bottom.

Traders widely expect the U.S. central bank to increase rates by a notch, a move that could smother demand for high-yielding emerging market assets.     But a batch of mixed economic data has cast a shadow on prospects of further hikes, driving the focus to the Fed's post-meeting policy statement.     The Mexican peso inched up to a fresh ten-month high, the fourth straight day of gains, but the country's benchmark S&P;/BMV IPC stock index slipped 0.1 percent.     The Brazilian real was nearly flat after firming as much as 0.4 percent earlier in the day.     Trading in Brazilian markets has been skittish as a ballooning political crisis has threatened to delay President Michel Temer's ambitious reform agenda, though a decision by his main ally to stay in his coalition fueled some optimism among investors.     The benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.1 percent, with shares of wood pulp producer Suzano Papel e Celulose SA  the biggest gainer.     Newspaper Valor Econômico reported on Tuesday that Suzano has hired two unidentified large Brazilian investment banks to analyze a bid for Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA.

Capita led the gains after offering a reassuring outlook. The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended up 0.6 percent, almost fully recovering losses from the previous session. Italy's benchmark rose 0.9 percent. Tech stocks rose more than 1 percent after Monday's sell-off, when concern over valuations at U.S. companies spilled over to Europe, particularly companies supplying Apple.  The tech sector has been relied upon as the driver of the bull run, particularly in the U.S., so whenever there is any weakness that's observed there, it is quickly picked up by the market,  said Jonathan Roy, advisory investment manager at Charles Hanover Investments.  The sector is fairly well-valued, in some respects quite richly valued, so that could be a weakness if we do see a souring in sentiment.  Dialog Semiconductor, Infineon and ASM International were among the tech stocks gaining the most, rising 1.2 to 4.7 percent. Italian banks were another bright spot, gaining 1.1 percent amid renewed hopes for a rescue of struggling Veneto banks. Italy's economy minister said a solution was  close  . UBI Banca and BPER Banca led European banks, rising 3.4 percent and 2.5 percent respectively. UniCredit gained 1.6 percent. Receding election worries also helped.  It's quite evident that the authorities are not too keen to let any institutions really, really fail ... there's always a last-minute deal done for them,  Charles Hanover Investments' Roy said. He sees value in Italy and Spain over the next 18 to 24 months. Among individual stocks, shares in troubled British outsourcing firm Capita jumped 15 percent after the group said it hoped to improve its profitability and secure more contract wins in the second half of 2017, following a series of profit warnings. Visitor attractions group Merlin Entertainments fell around 2.6 percent, however, after giving a cautious outlook. Attacks in Manchester and London had hit domestic demand, it said. Broker action propelled shares in London Stock Exchange Group 5.4 percent higher after Credit Suisse and RBC raised their target prices on the stock. Greek shares rose 1.6 percent after officials said a compromise on debt may be reached on Thursday, paving the way for new loans for Athens while leaving the contentious debt relief issue for later.  Attention has now squarely turned to debt relief talks  Barclays analysts said in a note.  We believe  that a marked effort would still be required to enable Greece to secure debt sustainability.

Arauco, a subsidiary of Chile's Empresas Copec SA (COP.SN), has hired Banco Santander SA (SAN.MC) to work on a proposal, according to Valor, which did not identify its sources. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is advising Fibria, the world's No. 1 eucalyptus pulpmaker, Valor added. Another potential contender is Suzano Papel & Celulose SA (SUZB5.SA), which has hired two unidentified large Brazilian investment banks to analyze a bid, Valor reported. Eldorado's equity could be worth between 3 billion reais and 4 billion reais ($904 million and $1.2 billion), two unidentified bankers told Valor. With debt hovering at 8 billion reais, Eldorado could soon be put up for sale, sources told Reuters in recent weeks, after two key members of Brazil's Batista family were ensnared in a corruption scandal. Eldorado's lenders are pressing for a sale, Valor said. J&F; Investimentos SA, the company overseeing the Batista businesses, owns 81 percent of Eldorado. The remaining 19 percent is owned by Brazilian pension funds Petros Fundação [PETROS.UL] and Funcef Fundação dos Economiarios [FUNCEF.UL], and special purpose vehicle FIP Olímpia.  Last October, J&F; started talks to buy out the stakes that  Petros and Funcef own in Eldorado. São Paulo-based J&F;, Fibria and Suzano all declined comment on the Valor report. The banks did not have an immediate comment. A representative of Santiago-based Copec did not immediately comment. Plea Deal Shares of Fibria gained nearly 1 percent, while Suzano added 1.4 percent on Tuesday in São Paulo trading.   All Latin America pulp producers would be interested in Eldorado if it becomes available for sale,  Itaú BBA analyst Marcos Assumpção said in a note.  Consolidation could add value through synergies extraction and increased supply discipline.  Joesley and Wesley Batista, the family members who last month entered the plea deal with Brazilian prosecutors, first want to speak to bidders before hiring an adviser for a sale, Valor said, citing banking executives with knowledge of the matter. Fibria seems the least likely suitor because a key shareholder, state development bank BNDES [BNDES.UL], is not expected to approve a transaction that could shore up the Batistas, Valor said, without naming its sources.  In their plea bargain, the Batista brothers named Brazilian President Michel Temer in a corruption scandal, unleashing retaliatory actions from the government against the group.

Speaking on a conference call about the company's results, which were released late on Monday, Gowans said Dominion's search for a new chief executive continues. Incumbent Brendan Bell resigned in January, saying he did not want to relocate to new company headquarters in Calgary. He steps down on June 30. Dominion is the world's third largest diamond producer by market value. It owns the Ekati mine and a stake in the Diavik mine, which is majority owned by global miner Rio Tinto , in Canada's Northwest Territories. The company reported a loss of $7.8 million in the first quarter of its fiscal 2018 year, or a loss of 9 cents per share. Dominion's stock was 0.2 percent firmer at C$17.39 on the Toronto Stock Exchange early on Tuesday afternoon. Dominion launched the sales process following an unsolicited $1.1 billion approach from U.S. billionaire Dennis Washington. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the country's biggest public pension fund, is considering a bid for Dominion Diamond and is studying the miner's books, people familiar with the process told Reuters. CPPIB is one of more than five parties that have signed an agreement with Dominion to get access to its confidential data, one source said.

Tembinkosi Bonakele, head of the Competition Commission, said the agency would investigate Aspen Pharmacare, Africa's biggest generic drug maker, U.S. company Pfizer and Swiss-based Roche Holding.  Here we have a suspicion. We think that the reason is excessive pricing by the participants in the market. We have to investigate and bring people to book,  Bonakele told a news conference.  The Competition Commission has identified the healthcare sector, and in particular, pharmaceuticals, as a priority sector for its enforcement efforts due to the likely negative impact that anti-competitive conduct in that sector would have on consumers in general and specifically the poor and vulnerable.  The Commission, which investigates cases before bringing them to the Competition Tribunal for adjudication, said it suspected the lung cancer treatment xalkori crizotinib sold by Pfizer had been excessively priced as has the breast cancer drugs Herceptin and Herclon sold by Roche. It also said it would look into whether Aspen, a local company based in Durban, might have over-charged for Leukeran, Alkeran and Myleran cancer treatments in South Africa. Roche said in an email it had not received a formal notification from the Commission when asked for comment.  In case we receive a formal notification, we will be cooperating fully with the authorities, will provide all required information and will respond to the allegations,  the company said. Pfizer did not immediately respond to telephone requests for comment. Aspen denied any wrongdoing, saying it had not increased its prices for medicines used to treat leukaemia beyond the margin approved by the South African health department. Some medicines in South Africa, including those sold by Roche and Aspen, are considered too essential to let manufacturers set the prices.  Aspen is committed to full and constructive engagement with the Competition Commission in this investigation,  the company said in a statement. Aspen is already under investigation by the European Commission over allegations that it is overcharging for five key cancer drugs.

Craig Phillips, counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, said on Tuesday that while banks had given a warm welcome to the many policy recommendations in a 148-page report released on Monday, the proposed changes were not issued with the goal of aiding Wall Street.  This is not a plan to help banks,  he said at a financial industry conference in Washington.  Our goal is to guide a regulatory path that helps banks better serve their customers without putting taxpayers at risk or lowering the standards that are appropriate.  U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, is pushing for deregulation across the federal government. Banking lobbyists and executives in Washington praised the Treasury Department report for its roughly 100 recommendations to streamline, relax or remove a range of the government's regulatory powers to police Wall Street.   The report is basically our entire wish list,  said one banking lobbyist who asked not to be named. Financial trade organizations called the report a much-needed reconsideration of rules put in place following the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  The report earned scorn, however, from advocates for tougher rules, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said on Monday it catered too much to Wall Street demands at the expense of consumers.  Phillips, a former executive at BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world's largest asset manager, said the plan was aimed at simplifying rules to ensure financial institutions can generate as much economic activity as possible.   There's overlap, there's duplication, there's confusion,  he said of the current regulatory load. As an example, Phillips questioned the need for two regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to conduct parallel probes into Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) following a recent sales practices scandal. The Treasury Department did not go into detail in terms of implementing key aspects of the report, such as how to change the $50 billion asset threshold for when banks face tougher regulation.  Banks above that $50 billion level are subject to heightened regulations including the requirement they submit  living wills  to regulators and pass stress tests on their portfolios.     But Phillips indicated the Treasury is open to major changes, suggesting an asset threshold as high as $500 billion, or one that emphasizes risk and complexity over size. He also said the Treasury would release three more reports in the coming months recommending regulatory changes, aimed at capital markets, asset managers, insurance and fintech. The reports will likely come sometime in September, he added.

The financial industry has warned that forced  relocation  would split markets, bump up trading costs and diminish the status of the euro -- as well as threaten thousands of jobs in the City of London. The draft EU law would, as a last resort, force euro-denominated clearing business to shift from London if the volume was deemed by Brussels to be systemically important. The bulk of clearing in euro-denominated derivatives is performed in London and involves a third party standing between two sides of a trade to ensure its smooth and safe completion. The European Central Bank (ECB) and euro zone policymakers have long wanted control over euro clearing, saying it is core to the single currency area's financial stability and would be outside the EU's regulatory sphere once Britain leaves in 2019. Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner who proposed the draft law, said Brexit meant that  certain adjustments to our rules  are needed and that no business would be shifted just for the sake of it. Britain's finance ministry said that the way that UK and EU firms access each other's markets is a matter for the forthcoming Brexit negotiations with Brussels.  In the meantime, we stand ready to engage constructively on this legislation, fulfilling our obligations as a member state.  Enhanced Supervision Under the draft law, if the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) decides that a non-EU clearer is handling  systemically  important volumes of euro-denominated business, a system of  enhanced supervision  would be introduced. This would mimic how U.S. regulators already have direct oversight of London clearing houses that handle dollar-denominated instruments, though there is no provision for forcing through a relocation of a clearing house. Under the EU law, the bloc's regulators would have a say on the amount and type of collateral the clearing house holds, ensure it meets any additional requirements from the ECB, and hold on-site inspections. The first aim of the law is to centralise supervision of EU-based clearing houses, with ESMA taking the lead, backed by central banks such as the ECB. At present, national supervisors oversee 17 clearers. The second aim is to build on the existing system of  equivalence , whereby 28 non-EU clearers can serve customers in the bloc if they comply with rules similar to the EU's. Two-tier equivalence means that the bulk of foreign clearers will continue under the existing system. Others would be deemed  systemically important  and require enhanced supervision, with only a few likely to labelled as  substantially systemically important  and required to rebase to the bloc, a process that would be phased in over 18 months. Brussels acknowledged that relocation could cause higher costs for users because of market fragmentation and has introduced  proportionate risk requirements  to mitigate this. But some trades could be cleared more cheaply in the EU, officials said. Last Resort  If enhanced supervision does not work because it is so systemic, then there can be a decision to require relocation. That is a last resort,  an EU source said. ESMA would have to make a relocation recommendation, with input from the ECB, but the European Commission would take the final decision. The European Commission decided not to include quantitative criteria for  systemic  clearing houses, such as caps on clearing volumes, leaving ESMA to make assessments case by case. Simon Gleeson, a regulatory partner at international law firm Clifford Chance, said there is no question of UK clearing being forced to relocate.  The issue is whether and to what extent the EU wishes to prevent EU banks from clearing euro trades outside the EU,  Gleeson said.  I think what is really going on here is the EU trying to create a bargaining chip that it can employ to get a more substantial say in the way that London clearing is regulated post-Brexit.  The draft law will need approval from EU states and the European Parliament, with changes likely.  The Commission has lost its courage when it comes to euro clearing. The rule must be that euro clearing must be done under EU jurisdiction, no ifs or buts,  said Markus Ferber, a vice chair of the parliament's economic affairs committee. Most euro-denominated clearing of derivatives is performed by LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange and the largest clearer of interest rate swaps. LSE chief Xavier Rolet said on Monday that relocation would have little financial impact because it has a clearing house in Paris that is fully authorised under EU rules. A global derivatives industry body warned on Monday that shifting clearing of euro-denominated derivatives from London to the continent would require banks to set aside far more cash to insure trades, a cost that would be passed on to companies. Officials from the Bank of England, which supervises LCH, have warned that euro clearing could shift to New York, but any U.S. clearing house that became a  systemic  clearer of euro-denominated instruments would also come under the new EU rules.

There was relief after Monday's tech stocks sell-off, which hit UK tech firms Micro Focus and Sophos, but trading remained muted with the FTSE 100 ending down 0.15 percent as investors continued to sift through the fall-out from Britain's election.  There's a tendency to turn to one factor and attribute it to that, but people always just get nervous when valuations get very high, as they did with these companies,  said Laura Foll, UK Equity fund manager at Henderson. The blue-chip index reversed earlier small gains as big international firms such as British American Tobacco and GlaxoSmithKline progressively lost ground, as high inflation numbers helped the sterling recover. Capita jumped 15 percent to its highest level in eight months after its trading update suggested green shoots of recovery were appearing. The outsourcing firm scored its best day in 17 years as analysts praised progress in its efforts to restructure the business which has suffered a string of profit warnings and demotion from the blue-chip index.  Capita's pre-close interim management statement points to progress on many fronts as Capita works through a  transitional  year,  said UBS analysts. Capita helped mid-caps gain 0.9 percent, outperforming the blue chips. The morning after Prime Minister Theresa May's grilling by Conservative MPs following a disastrous election, investors looked for signs the government stance on Brexit was softening.  There seems to be a shift towards staying in the single market and the customs union,  said Foll.  That would be pretty significant for our portfolio if it did prove to be true.  London Stock Exchange rose 5.4 percent after the firm said it expected growth, shrugging off the disappointment of a scuppered merger with Deutsche Boerse. Merlin fell 2.7 percent after the entertainment company behind Madame Tussaud's waxworks museum and Legoland said militant attacks in London and Manchester had dented demand. The company's shares have been the most sensitive to recent attacks. Ashtead ended down 2.5 percent, reversing earlier gains that followed results showing a 7 percent rise in full-year profit, boosted by strong growth in its core North American unit as well as its UK business. Meanwhile, among mid-caps, oil services firm Petrofac gained 3.7 percent, boosted by a $35 million contract with the Kuwait Oil Company. Property company Kennedy Wilson Europe jumped 7.3 percent after its U.S. parent company sweetened a deal to buy it back.

Craig Phillips, counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, said on Tuesday that while banks had given a warm welcome to the many policy recommendations in a 148-page report released on Monday, the proposed changes were not issued with the goal of aiding Wall Street.  This is not a plan to help banks,  he said at a financial industry conference in Washington.  Our goal is to guide a regulatory path that helps banks better serve their customers without putting taxpayers at risk or lowering the standards that are appropriate.  U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, is pushing for deregulation across the federal government. Banking lobbyists and executives in Washington praised the Treasury Department report for its roughly 100 recommendations to streamline, relax or remove a range of the government's regulatory powers to police Wall Street.   The report is basically our entire wish list,  said one banking lobbyist who asked not to be named. Financial trade organizations called the report a much-needed reconsideration of rules put in place following the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  The report earned scorn, however, from advocates for tougher rules, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said on Monday it catered too much to Wall Street demands at the expense of consumers.  Phillips, a former executive at BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world's largest asset manager, said the plan was aimed at simplifying rules to ensure financial institutions can generate as much economic activity as possible.   There's overlap, there's duplication, there's confusion,  he said of the current regulatory load. As an example, Phillips questioned the need for two regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to conduct parallel probes into Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) following a recent sales practices scandal. The Treasury Department did not go into detail in terms of implementing key aspects of the report, such as how to change the $50 billion asset threshold for when banks face tougher regulation.  Banks above that $50 billion level are subject to heightened regulations including the requirement they submit  living wills  to regulators and pass stress tests on their portfolios.     But Phillips indicated the Treasury is open to major changes, suggesting an asset threshold as high as $500 billion, or one that emphasizes risk and complexity over size. He also said the Treasury would release three more reports in the coming months recommending regulatory changes, aimed at capital markets, asset managers, insurance and fintech. The reports will likely come sometime in September, he added.

The impact of the fall in the pound since last year's Brexit vote made itself felt as the higher costs of foreign holidays and of imported computer games and equipment helped push up consumer prices by 2.9 percent year-on-year. That was its biggest annual increase since June 2013, the Office for National Statistics said, and was above the median forecast of 2.7 percent in a Reuters poll of economists. It is also faster than the growth in pay for most people who have suffered a squeeze on their incomes almost without break for a decade. Data due to be released on Wednesday is likely to show basic pay rose by an annual 2.0 percent in the three months to April, according to another Reuters poll. Prime Minister Theresa May, weakened by the loss of her parliamentary majority in the election, has accepted that voters' patience with austerity is at an end, the Times  reported on Tuesday. Despite the stronger-than-expected consumer price inflation figures, the pound fell slightly after the ONS data, possibly reflecting a slowing of the surge in prices faced by factories which hints at slower inflation ahead for households. Paul Hollingsworth, an economist with Capital Economics, said he believed the data showed the drop in the pound has fed through into inflation more quickly than expected.  While we think that CPI inflation will peak at a little above 3 percent before the end of this year, it is likely to drop back fairly quickly in 2018,  he said. The ONS said one of the main drivers for inflation in May was the increased cost of package holidays abroad for British tourists who have to pay more for their euros and dollars. Another big push on prices came from computer games and equipment, which are typically imported and therefore reflect the diminished buying power of sterling since the Brexit vote.     Inflation has picked up speed broadly around the world but in Britain there is extra pressure from the fall in sterling, contributing to a sharp slowdown in British economic growth since the start of this year. A shopper carries a basket in a supermarket in London, Britain April 11, 2017.Neil HallCredit card firm Visa said on Monday it saw the first annual fall in spending by consumers in nearly four years in May. That was before last week's shock election result that has raised questions about how May will advance her plans to take Britain out of the European Union, and push other legislation. A survey of executives published on Monday showed business confidence plunging after the election. Factory Costs Surge Easing Despite the sharp rise in prices, the Bank of England is widely expected to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25 percent when it announces its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday. The BoE has said it will tolerate inflation above its target of 2 percent because so far there has been no knock-on effect on pay which could generate a longer-lasting inflation problem. But the BoE had previously said it only expected inflation to reach the kind of levels it has now hit at the end of this year.  Some economists have said Britain's political turmoil is likely to make the BoE more cautious about considering a rate hike and could even lead it to revive its massive bond-buying program if the economy weakens further. The BoE was also likely to take comfort from the data which showed inflationary pressures might be easing. Input prices for factories fell by 1.3 percent in month-on-month terms in May, taking the yearly rate of price growth down to 11.6 percent from a downwardly revised 15.6 percent in April, its slowest annual growth rate since last September. Growth in prices charged by factories held steady at an annual 3.6 percent, in line with the Reuters poll.

Ahead of his appointment, Baker tweeted:  The language of 'hard' vs 'soft' Brexit is so misleading. We need a good, clean exit which minimises disruption and maximises opportunity.  In other words, we need the 'softest' exit consistent with actually leaving and controlling laws, money, borders and trade,  he said. Since last year's vote to leave the EU, Baker has played an influential role in organising a group of eurosceptic lawmakers within May's Conservative Party in opposition to any attempt to water down the terms of Britain's departure. Earlier this year, Baker said in an article posted on his website that Britain must seek a new and independent partnership with the EU, rejecting any kind of  associate membership, or anything that leaves us half-in, half-out.  The Liberal Democrats, a party that has consistently opposed Brexit, said Baker's appointment  flies in the face of last week's election in which the British people clearly rejected May's extreme version of Brexit .  Far from softening her stance on Brexit, Theresa May is doubling down by appointing an arch Brexiteer to help lead the negotiations,  said Liberal Democrat lawmaker Alistair Carmichael.  She is putting a fox in charge of guarding the henhouse.

The repricing shows how much the loan market has changed since banks originally pulled a US$5.6bn loan package backing the buyout in November 2015 amid turbulent market conditions stemming from sinking oil prices and broad macroeconomic concerns. “It is a terrific reminder of how quickly the new issue market changes,” said a senior banker. “The original new issue timing could not have been worse.” The timing now could not be better, said bankers, thanks to huge demand from investors anxious to grab yield and protect against rising interest rates. New Market Software provider Veritas is asking lenders to cut pricing by approximately 100bp on this debt, which was “seemingly left for dead a short time ago,” according to an investor. That should still provide enough yield to entice existing investors to hold onto the paper and lure new investors to replace any lenders who opt to drop out, though that seems unlikely. One Collateralized Loan Obligation investor said that his firm is holding onto any B2-rated loans that are repricing at 300bp or higher. The Veritas loans are rated B2/B+, with the company rated B3/B. The issuer is looking to reprice a US$1.948bn term loan B1 and a €900m term loan B1 between 450bp and 475bp over their respective benchmarks. The loans priced at 562.5bp over the benchmarks after banks funded the loans backing the buyout by The Carlyle Group in January 2016. The loans were finally syndicated in June 2016. The debt has been trading above par for much of the year as the company’s financial numbers have improved. The company’s Ebitda stood at US$740m as of the fiscal year end of March 13, 2017, a source said. This number is lower than the US$760m of Ebitda reported when the deal was syndicated last year, but is higher than it was in September 2016 when business bottomed out. Secured leverage is being marketed at 4.5 times Ebitda with total leverage at 5.6 times, the source said. Lenders said they expect the repricing to get done, but the Ebitda number still means there are some question marks at the company, according to a source familiar with the deal. The source noted that with sales down among software, the company has been selling hardware to offset the revenue losses, which is a commoditized business. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Jefferies are leading the repricing and were all involved in underwriting the initial deal. Commitments are due June 15. Not Alone Veritas is not the only company to return to the market after seeing a deal struggle. In March, web conferencing provider Premiere Global Services tacked on US$115m to its first-lien loan and US$50m to its second-lien loan to back a dividend and refinancing effort. The first-lien add-on was sold at a discount of 99 cents on the dollar, while the second-lien debt priced at a discount of 98 cents on the dollar. This is in line with other deals of this nature, but banks sold the original first-lien loan at a discount of 90 cents in May 2016. “It really is an issuers’ market, and you’re going to see every company who can bring deals,” said another banker.

The Pentagon needs to give its decision makers and weapons buyers more accurate budget and cost information so they can make better decisions as they modernize weapons systems, the report said.  U.S. President Donald Trump's $4.1 trillion fiscal 2018 budget proposal included $603 billion in defense spending for the Department of Defense as well as nuclear weapons programs at the Department of Energy and other national defense priorities. The GAO report comes as U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis presented lawmakers in the House and Senate with a $33 billion wish list of unfunded military needs. The report said despite increased defense funding under Trump, efforts  underway to rebuild readiness for portions of their military forces  are at risk without more comprehensive planning efforts at the Pentagon.  The federal agency, which oversees government resources, also said the Defense Department could police global hot spots with less expensive and more numerous regular troops instead of U.S. special forces.   DOD has not taken steps to examine whether additional opportunities exist to reduce the high demand on these (special) forces by sharing some of their responsibilities with conventional forces,  the report said.  U.S. President Donald Trump's fiscal 2018 budget proposal gave the military a modest boost to their budget, 3 percent more than what former President Barack Obama had sought in his long-term budget plan. The $574.5 billion for the Department of Defense would go to warfighting readiness and critical program requirements.  GAO said it has made approximately 3,100 recommendations to DOD since 2006. Of these about 1,037 have not been acted on, including 78 priority recommendations. The report released on Tuesday made no new recommendations.

The company said it plans to enter Kansas, Missouri and Nevada in 2018, as well as expand its operations in six existing markets: Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Texas, and Washington.  The move is in contrast to some other insurers, which have blamed Republicans for not doing enough to stabilize the marketplace, particularly in guaranteeing the continued payment of Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies next year. The subsidies are available to low-income Americans who buy individual health insurance on the exchanges created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. Republican lawmakers and Trump have promised to repeal and replace the law but have disagreed over the details, creating uncertainty at a time when insurers must submit plans and premium rates for 2018.  Centene recognizes there is uncertainty of new healthcare legislation, but we are well positioned to continue providing accessible, high quality and culturally-sensitive healthcare services to our members,  CEO Michael Neidorff said in a statement.

The company, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, has $45 billion in excess capital that could be returned to shareholders eventually, Gerspach said. Roughly $29 billion of that is in deferred tax assets that cannot be distributed immediately, while another $15 billion to $16 billion is sitting idle not earning profits, he said. Like other big U.S. banks, Citigroup cannot return capital to shareholders through stock repurchases or dividends without permission from regulators. The Federal Reserve oversees an annual stress test whose outcome determines how they can use capital. Another process known as  living wills,  which requires banks to submit plans for dismantling themselves without taxpayer support in case of a crisis, also affects how they manage their businesses. Citigroup is particularly focusing on improving its resolution plan, Gerspach said. In the past, it has failed the stress test and its resolution plan has been rejected.

Around 400 retail investors, represented by the Spanish Association of Minority Shareholders, asked Spain's Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on June 8 to investigate whether Popular's chairman Emilio Saracho and former board member Antonio del Valle misled the market and accelerated the bank's demise, a document reviewed by Reuters shows. The prosecutor's office, which acknowledged the complaint, did not say whether it will pursue the matter.  Saracho did not reply to an email seeking comment and a spokesman for Ve Por Mas, a financial group controlled by del Valle's family, said del Valle had no comment. In a separate development, Spanish consumer group OCU said on Monday it had filed a lawsuit with the High Court against Popular's previous board, in which it alleges false accounting. Banco Popular declined to comment on either action and sources told Reuters there was not yet any joint defense strategy by the former board members and lawyers had not yet been appointed. Asked about the OCU claim on Monday, Popular's former chairman Angel Ron told esRadio:  If someone brings forward charges against us accusing us of committing a crime we have never committed, we would respond with the legal tools at our disposal, with calm, knowing that the work has been done well, in accordance with the opinion of the authorities that show that the bank was solvent and that there has been a liquidity problem in recent weeks.  As part of the rescue, which involved activating Europe's strict new bank resolution regime, Santander bought Popular for 1 euro, while shareholders and junior bond investors saw their investments wiped out. Any legal action taken against Popular would become the responsibility of Santander, and could take years to resolve based on previous such cases. OCU said it had received inquiries from shareholders who subscribed to Popular's 2.5 billion euro (2.8 billion) capital increase in May 2016. The investors said they were not privy to the correct financial information, it added. OCU sent a letter to the Economy Ministry and Bank of Spain last week asking that Popular's 300,000 retail investors should have any claims heard quickly, rather than the years lawsuits such as theirs normally take to resolve. Rival Spanish lender Bankia was taken over by the government in 2012, just a year after a listing in which hundreds of thousands of small investors bought shares. It was subject to a number of court cases before eventually agreeing last year to pay them 1.5 billion euros in compensation.

Food rations for 7.8 million Ethiopians are due to run out in July due to funding shortages, while neighboring Somalia is on the verge of its second famine in six years. In an unprecedented move, the World Bank is giving $50 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization to distribute emergency food, water and cash in Somalia.  We are demonstrating not just that we appreciate the kind of pressure that Somalia is facing but the importance of the humanitarian and development actors working together,  said Mahmoud Mohieldin, a senior World Bank official. Consecutive failed rains have led to widespread crop failures, hurting farmers and livestock herders across the region, many of whom are hungry and on the move in search of grazing, water and work.  The African Development Bank (ADB) has also announced $1.1 billion to combat drought in six countries, mostly in the Horn of Africa.   Officials from the U.N., World Bank, ADB and African Union held a news conference in Nairobi after meeting displaced people in Ethiopia's Somali region and Somalia's Gedo region. The greatest needs are in Ethiopia, where numbers are predicted to rise due to poor spring rains, and South Sudan, where 5.5 million are short of food, with some areas already in famine, the U.N. says.  We have both the biggest food insecurity crisis and the biggest displacement crisis this region has ever faced,  said Dirk-Jan Omtzigt, an analyst with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Nairobi. The number of refugees and asylum seekers in East Africa has almost tripled to 4.3 million since 2011, he said, driven by conflict, climate change and economic shocks like falling livestock prices during drought. In a  Grand Bargain , struck at last year's World Humanitarian Summit, donors promised to make their funding more flexible to respond to growing humanitarian crises globally. The World Bank has started funding humanitarians to deliver aid in countries like Somalia and Yemen, where a rapid response is needed but conflict has weakened governments' ability to reach needy populations, Mohieldin said.

Presidential elections are scheduled in seven countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Venezuela), with term limits in all countries except for one (Venezuela) leading to new presidents. In addition, there will be important congressional elections in Argentina, which will test the Macri administration's reform agenda, and El Salvador, where months of political gridlock have led to dwindling government financing options and a debt default. Elections will be particularly important for rating dynamics in countries with a Negative Rating Outlook, such as Chile, Brazil and Mexico. Chile's low economic growth environment and higher fiscal deficits have led its debt burden to double over the past five years. In Brazil, a series of corruption scandals have engulfed the political establishment and increased political uncertainty and could lead to greater contentiousness in the next elections. Strong political leadership will be required in order to continue to pass reforms that improve the outlook for growth and public finances. In Mexico, sluggish economic growth, and institutional weaknesses such as the high incidence of crime and the perception of increased corruption have reduced President Pena Nieto's popularity. Upcoming NAFTA negotiations are also influencing the political uncertainty. The elections are important to Costa Rica and El Salvador as well to see if they help in breaking the political deadlock that has led to negative rating movements over the last six months. Fiscal reform measures are pending, with possible ratings implications in both countries. In addition, the next government of El Salvador will likely inherit a weak economy. In Venezuela, where economic and political dynamics have been extremely challenging, presidential elections are currently scheduled for December 2018. The government has called for a Constituent Assembly, which could alter the election schedule, while the opposition is seeking a change in government. The situation remains very fluid. A new government could lead to policy changes aimed at eliminating severe economic distortions, but the probability of default remains high. While Colombia's Rating Outlook is Stable, fiscal consolidation will be challenged by low growth and the implementation of the peace agreement with the FARC. Fitch expects the transition of power following the elections to be smooth in all countries, with the possible exception of Venezuela. Elections themselves do not directly impact ratings unless accompanied by marked shifts in policies. Fitch will continue to monitor how economic policies and performance evolve following the elections. A marked policy shift away from market-friendly policies could weigh on the credit profiles of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. An end to political gridlock in Costa Rica or El Salvador, on the other hand, could support their credit profiles. The next administrations in both Chile and Colombia will face challenges to achieving fiscal consolidation, which will be central to those countries' rating trajectories.

The FSA will  fairly quickly  check whether banks have set up the more in-depth risk assessments of customers, products, services, transactions and geographical areas that the new law orders them to, deputy Director General Thomas Brenoe said. Banks operating in Denmark, including market leader Danske Bank and Stockholm-based Nordea, have boosted staff levels at anti-money-laundering (AML) units in preparation for the legislation.  Normally when we've done inspections we've looked at the banks' AML efforts from A to Z, but we just might do it differently this time around and start by checking their risk assessments,  Brenoe said in a telephone interview. The FSA will most thoroughly examine whether each bank has factored in the risks that apply specifically to it, Brenoe said.  Worst case would be if a compliance lawyer has just written down some sort of standard risk assessment, altogether detached from the business, just to comply with the law,  he added. Danske Bank said it focused extensively on combating money laundering but added it could not yet comment in-depth on its efforts.  The whole AML-field has great focus in Danske Bank and we're continuously adapting the number of employees to the area as needed,  a spokesman for the bank said.  We can confirm that we in Nordea have manned up significantly within both AML and compliance over the last couple of years,  a spokesman for that bank said, declining to elaborate. The Danish government aims to raise the maximum penalty for money laundering to eight years in prison from six years currently, Justice Minister Soren Pape Poulsen told lawmakers on in April. His proposal will be discussed in parliament after the summer break.

Italy's borrowing costs dropped to multi-month lows, the bond yield spread over Germany was at its narrowest in nearly three weeks and the country's debt agency sold 5.5 billion euros of bonds in an auction. Political risk appeared to be waning in Italy after former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi ruled out snap elections later this year. In addition, 5-Star Movement suffered a resounding defeat in local elections, results released on Monday showed.  The news is generally positive for risk sentiment in Europe - the tail risk (presented by Italian elections) is being displaced by six months or more, so you are looking at potentially six to nine months of carry,  said Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet.  So investors are willing to take on spread risk - that is, sell Germany and get into Italy.  The gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields dropped to 171 basis points on Tuesday, the lowest in almost three weeks and well off the 201 bps it reached last week. The yield on Italy's 10-year government bond fell more than 3 bps to its lowest since late January at around 1.97 percent. That help push other low-rated Southern European government bond yields down: Portugal's 10-year bond yield fell to a new nine-month low of 2.93 percent, while Spanish yields nudged lower. While political risks have largely slipped down investors' worry lists since centrist Emmanuel Macron won the French presidential election, they have not completely disappeared. In the Netherlands, a lack of progress in forming a new government since elections in March have weighed on Dutch bonds . Political turbulence in Finland has also drawn attention this week. Finland's government averted collapse on Tuesday when the nationalist Finns Party split into two groups, leaving newly elected hardline anti-immigrant leaders in the cold. The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the region, was up just 1 bps on the day at 0.27 percent. Last week's decision by the European Central Bank to cut inflation forecasts and signal monetary policy will remain loose has also helped euro zone bonds, analysts said.  You also saw the ECB cut the inflation forecasts for 2019 - the likely read through from that is that they will have to prolong the asset purchase programme,  Bouvet said. This is in sharp contrast with the United States, where policymakers are largely expected to raise rates on Wednesday and may provide more detail on plans to shrink its mammoth bond portfolio. The  transatlantic spread  between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs were close to one-month highs at 195 bps as U.S. ratesetters were set to begin a two-day meeting later on Tuesday. Elsewhere, euro zone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund are likely to strike a compromise on Greece on Thursday, clearing the way for new loans for Athens while leaving the contentious debt relief issue for later, officials said. Short-dated government bond yields in Greece fell to 4.896 percent, their lowest level since October 2014.

Inflation at the factory gate, however, remains supported by sustained increases in the cost of services as well as a softening dollar, which is lifting prices of some imported goods.   Inflation down at the producer level of the economy's factory-to-consumer supply chain remains on the warm side, which is in keeping with the economy moving beyond full employment,  said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.

In the 12 months through May the PPI increased 2.4 percent, retreating from April's 2.5 percent surge, which was the biggest yearly increase since February 2012. Last month's inflation readings were broadly in line with economists' expectations. A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services fell 0.1 percent last month, the first decline in a year.

The Brazilian planemaker is in negotiations that are in various stages with around ten countries, including Sweden and New Zealand, for the military cargo jet, according to the sources, after six nations showed formal interest during early development.  The Brazilian Air Force has ordered 28 of the aircraft for 7.2 billion reais ($2.2 billion), with two deliveries set for 2018 and three in 2019.  Among foreign governments, talks with the Portuguese are the most advanced after Lisbon authorized negotiations for five KC-390s, the sources said. One said there may be an option for a sixth KC-390 focused on domestic firefighting missions. Common shares of Embraer rose 0.6 percent to 15.75 reais in Sao Paulo trading, trimming year-to-date losses to 0.5 percent.   Embraer does not comment on potential sales,  the company said in a statement. The new cargo jet represents a bid by Embraer to take a bite out of a military transport segment long dominated by the workhorse Hercules C-130, made by U.S. aerospace firm Lockheed Martin Corp. Embraer has previously forecast a market worth over $50 billion in the coming decades to replace more than 700 older Hercules aircraft, some of them in service since the 1960s. Portugal, a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was one of the first countries to express interest in the KC-390 in 2010, along with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and the Czech Republic. Embraer's Portuguese subsidiary OGMA has helped to build the jet's fuselage and other parts. Chief Executive Paulo Cesar Silva said last month he was  very confident  Embraer would get its first KC-390 order from outside of Latin America this year.  In April, Embraer's defense unit head Jackson Schneider said the KC-390 could yield the company $1.5 billion in annual exports once the jet enters service next year.

Shaw said it would pay C$430 million ($325 million) to acquire wireless spectrum from Quebecor Media Inc, which is majority-owned by Quebecor Inc, for use in its home markets in Alberta and British Columbia as well as in southern Ontario. The moves are the latest one-two M&A; punch from Shaw, after early last year selling its media assets to sister company Corus Entertainment and acquiring Wind Mobile, which it rebranded as Freedom Mobile in November. Shares of both Shaw and Quebecor jumped after the news, with Shaw up 4.2 percent to C$29.75 and Quebecor up 1.9 percent at C$41.35 in morning trade.  It was a good price (for ViaWest), a good strategic move to focus back onto the core,  said Jeff Fan, a telecom analyst at Scotiabank, adding that the price they paid for the Quebecor spectrum was at the high end of his expected range. Calgary-based Shaw is locked in a fierce battle for internet, television and telephone customers in the west of the country with Vancouver-based rival Telus Corp.  Just by getting low-band spectrum it's not going to put them on equal footing, but it does narrow the network quality gap quite significantly,  Scotiabank's Fan said. The spectrum transaction requires approvals from a competition watchdog and the government, and is expected to close this summer. Analysts were calling on Shaw to sell its data center business after U.S. telecommunications firms Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc reaped several billions of dollars after agreeing to sell their portfolios last year. Shaw bought ViaWest from private equity firms Oak Hill Capital Partners and GI Partners for about $1.2 billion three years ago. Peak 10 Holding is owned by GI Partners. ViaWest is a Colorado-based data center company which offers hybrid IT and cloud-based solutions. It owns about 30 data centers in several U.S. states including Colorado, Nevada and Minnesota. Reuters reported in April that Shaw was looking for a buyer for ViaWest and was expecting a higher price than its original investment. TD Securities acted as exclusive financial adviser and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Dentons Canada LLP provided legal advice, Shaw said.

The offering comes over a year after Apple issued its first green bond of $1.5 billion - the largest issued by a U.S. corporation - as a response to the 2015 Paris agreement.  Apple said its second green bond is meant to show that businesses are still committed to the goals of the 194-nation accord. “Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change and protect our shared planet,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives.  Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was one of several CEOs who directly appealed to Trump to keep the United States in the pact before he made his decision. The tech giant said proceeds from the green bond sales will be used to finance renewable energy, energy efficiency at Apple facilities and in its supply chain and procuring safer materials for its products.  The offering also includes a specific focus on helping Apple meet a goal of greening its supply chain and using only renewable resources or recycled material, reducing its need to mine rare earth materials.  Last year, Apple allocated $442 million to 16 different projects from renewable energy to recycling from its first bond offer. One of the projects it funded was a robotic system called Liam to take apart junked iPhones and recover valuable materials that can be recycled, such as silver and tungsten - an attempt to address criticism that Apple's products, while sleek and seamless in design, are so tightly constructed that their components can be difficult to take apart.  Although green bonds comprise a small fraction of the overall bond market, demand has grown significantly as investors seek lower-carbon investments. In 2016, $81 billion of green bonds were issued, double the number from 2015, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, an organization that promotes the use of green bonds. Governments are also embracing the use of green bonds as a way to meet a 2015 pledge by world leaders to limit global warming this century to below 2 degrees Celsius.

Technology shares also edged higher after a two-session sell-off that put the spotlight on areas of the stock market where valuations appear stretched. The Fed, the U.S. central bank, is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday and may also provide details on its plans to shrink $4.5 trillion of assets it amassed to nurse the economic recovery. Analysts say the Fed could take an aggressively hawkish posture of signaling a balance sheet reduction this year and another rate increase in December.  Wednesday's meeting is pretty much a high-risk event,  said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasuries trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York. The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England also meet this week, although no major policy changes are expected. The gap between benchmark U.S and European bond yields held near its widest in a month as the Fed meeting also shone a light on the slow pace of change in European Central Bank policy. The Canadian dollar hit a two-month high after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the central bank's 2015 rate cuts  have largely done their work,  signaling that it could raise rates sooner than previously thought. A U.S. dollar index was down 0.1 percent. In the Treasury market, U.S. two-year yields touched 1.359 percent, their highest in a month, while three-year yields touched their highest since May 24 at 1.500 percent ahead of three- and 10-year note auctions on Monday. Big technology names like Microsoft and Alphabet helped prop up U.S. stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 54.03 points, or 0.25 percent, to 21,289.7, the S&P; 500 had gained 5.18 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,434.57 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 25.29 points, or 0.41 percent, to 6,200.76.

The $52 billion internet firm's shareholders on Thursday approved the sale of its operating businesses to Verizon Communications for $4.5 billion. The long-standing wrinkle, though, is that Yahoo bought the minority holdings so cheaply that essentially the entire value of both would be taxable in the United States if it sold them. That means the company is, at least in theory, now a proxy for where investors think U.S. corporate tax rates are going. As of now, they seem to be skeptical about President Donald Trump's ability to work with Congress to reform the tax system so that companies pay as little as 15 percent on their profit. Take Yahoo's market value, strip out nearly $7 billion of net cash and the value of what Verizon is buying, and the after-tax worth of the two Asian stakes is roughly $41 billion, according to a new Breakingviews calculator (see graphic tmsnrt.rs/2rRE6UL). The full market value of Yahoo's Alibaba stake is around $54 billion, while the Yahoo Japan holding is worth $9 billion. So investors seem to be factoring in a 35 percent tax hit. That exactly matches the rate currently in force, not Trump's preferred figure or even the 25 percent that has been put forward by House Republicans. The implication is that shareholders are attaching a very low probability, and perhaps also a long wait, to any meaningful reduction in America's company tax rate. Looked at another way, those who believe Trump will achieve significant tax reform in the near term should perhaps fill their boots with Yahoo stock. After all, if the tax rate were slashed to 15 percent, that would in theory boost the after-tax value of the two big overseas stakes by over $12 billion, by Breakingviews' math, potentially pushing the company's shares up nearly a quarter from their closing price on Friday. For anyone who made the bet, that might truly count as making America great again.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The official declined to be named under briefing rules. Phil Kornbluth, head of U.S.-based industry consultants Kornbluth Helium Consulting said his sources had confirmed the closure.

The notes are denominated in Uruguayan pesos and payable in U.S. dollars, and have a coupon of 9.875%. Proceeds from this issuance will be used for general budgetary and liability management purposes. Proceeds equivalent to USD250 million from the issuance are being used to swap out a portion of outstanding local bonds in inflation-indexed peso units. This issuance represents a step in the sovereign's strategy of deepening and diversifying its local-currency funding options. Uruguay's relatively high reliance on foreign-currency funding exposes its sovereign balance sheet to greater exchange-rate risk than that of its 'BBB' category peers. KEY RATING DRIVERS The bond rating is in line with the Uruguay's Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB-'. As per Fitch's Sovereign Criteria (July 2016), bonds issued in local currency but payable in foreign currency are assigned the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR. RATING SENSITIVITIES The bond rating would be sensitive to any changes in Uruguay's Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR, which Fitch affirmed at 'BBB-'/Stable on April 7, 2017.

Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said in an interview with CBC Radio that the economic recovery from weak oil prices appeared to be widening.  What that suggests to us is that the interest rate cuts we put in place in 2015 have largely done their work,  Poloz said.  So that's very reassuring, we're encouraged by the data.  Poloz's comments echoed a more hawkish tone from Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins on Monday, though he stopped short of suggesting a near-term rate move, economists said.  It's coming from the upper echelons at the Bank of Canada so I think it's a pretty strong signal,  said Nick Exarhos, economist at CIBC. With gains in employment and solid first-quarter growth, it is reasonable for the central bank to begin laying the groundwork for considering rate hikes by the end of the year or the beginning of 2018, said Exarhos. He expects the bank to hike twice in the first half of 2018. It would be the bank's first hike since 2010. The bank held its overnight rate steady for five years before cutting it twice in 2015 to the current level of 0.50 percent. The change in tone from policymakers this week has prompted traders to raise their bets on rate hikes this year, with markets pricing in a 72.3 percent chance of an increase by December. The Canadian dollar added to strength against the greenback on Poloz's comments. The bank makes its next interest rate decision on July 12, but markets see just 21.5-percent odds of a hike that soon. Poloz noted a stronger export picture remained a big missing element and suggests there are competitiveness challenges for Canadian companies. A second missing element is business investment, which has been slow, though there are signs it is picking up, he said.  It isn't time to throw a party,  Poloz added. Wilkins said on Monday the central bank would assess whether it needs to keep interest rates at near-record lows as the economy continues to grow. The bank last moved on rates in 2015 as tumbling oil prices put the economy in a brief recession. It has stood pat since.

The BoE, which supervises insurers, proposed changes to its rules that make senior managers at insurers directly accountable for their actions. British companies in general have been urged by the government to appoint more women board members to boost diversity. Shareholder advisory group PIRC last month criticised Britain's largest insurer Prudential for the absence of a target to increase the number of women on its board. The Bank of England proposed that insurers should have a policy of considering a  broad set of qualities and competencies  when recruiting board members, and have a policy to promote diversity among board members. The Bank said diverse boards would provide a more effective challenge to management as well as bringing a broader set of perspectives. These should help boards to identify a wider range of risks and be better able to understand their impact, which would in turn provide greater protection for policy holders, the BoE said in a consultation paper. It proposed no quotas for making boards more diverse, and said companies were best placed to determine themselves the details of their policy to promote diversity. Jacey Graham, co-founder of Brook Graham, a diversity consultancy at Pinsent Masons' law firm, said the insurance industry in general had been behind the curve in addressing this issue. But he also said he was encouraged by the work being done now by his clients in this sector, especially on gender diversity.  The focus also needs to be on diversity in executive committees, however, for the industry to truly change and reap the business benefits,  Graham said. Reporting by Huw Jones and Carolyn Cohn.

The high-speed link, in theory a centrepiece of Chinese-Thai cooperation, has been held up by years of negotiation over everything from cost and loan terms to land development rights. A Thai government spokesman said on Tuesday that Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who heads the junta that has ruled Thailand since a May 2014 coup, will invoke Article 44, a security order that gives him the power to push through policy. Prayuth will discuss the matter at a cabinet meeting next week. The measure, dubbed the  dictators law , has been heavily criticized by rights groups. Government spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said invoking Article 44 would clear hurdles such as building on protected land.  This is why Article 44 is needed,  he told reporters. The $5.5 billion first phase of the railway will be a 250 km (155 miles) line between Bangkok and the northeastern province of Nakorn Ratchasima. Transport Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith said last month that construction would begin in August or September. Thailand will largely fund the project and China will provide technical assistance under terms agreed so far. Including later phases, the project intends to build a 873-km rail line linking Thailand's border with Laos to eastern ports and industrial zones. China wants to connect its cities to trade centres in Southeast Asia, including Thailand's eastern industrial zones, as part of its 'One Belt, One Road' project, while Thailand needs to revamp its aging rail network and boost trade. Thailand and China have enjoyed warmer relations following the 2014 coup which saw several Western nations downgrade ties with Thailand in response. The rail project, however, has hit various delays over details including construction funding and technical assistance.

The agreement, to be filed as an amendment to an Iran sanctions bill, is intended to punish Russia over issues including its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for the government of Syria in that country's six-year-long civil war. [L1N1J41LS] The Iran bill is due come up for a vote as soon as this week. Besides the provision setting up a process for Congress to review changes in sanctions, the measure would put into law sanctions previously established via presidential executive order, including some on certain Russian energy projects and debt financing in some industries. It would impose new sanctions on Russians found to be guilty of human rights abuses, supplying weapons to Syria's government and conduct cyber attacks on behalf of Russia's government, among others. The measure also would allow new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways. National flags of Russia and the U.S. fly at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow, Russia April 11, 2017.Maxim ShemetovThe legislation is backed by both Republicans and Democrats, and is expected to easily pass the Senate. It was introduced amid an intense focus in the U.S. capital on relations with Russia, and investigations by the Department of Justice and congressional committees of whether Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. elections to help elect Republican President Donald Trump, and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow as it sought to influence the election.  To become law, the legislation would have to pass the House of Representatives and be signed into law by Trump. If Trump objected, some of its backers said they expected enough congressional support to override a veto.  These additional sanctions will ... send a powerful and bipartisan statement to Russia and any other country who might try to interfere in our elections that they will be punished,  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. Russia has denied attempting to interfere in the U.S election, and Trump has dismissed any talk of collusion. The measure also authorizes  robust assistance  to strengthen democratic institutions and counter disinformation in European countries that might be targeted by what the legislation's sponsors described as Russian aggression. In December, the final full month of President Barack Obama's administration, Washington sanctioned Russian businessmen and companies for Moscow's role in Ukraine via executive order.

The company, Europe's leading producer of hydropower which has been hit by low power prices in the Nordic region, announced plans to divest its stakes in UK offshore wind farms last year but had given no timetable.

Morgan's latest Treasury client survey showed on Tuesday. The share of  short  investors who said they were holding fewer longer-dated U.S. government securities than their portfolio benchmarks rose to 27 percent from 23 percent in the prior week, according to the survey. J.P. Morgan surveyed clients including bond fund managers, central banks and sovereign wealth funds. The share of  long  investors who said they were holding more longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks fell to 9 percent from 11 percent the prior week. Short investors outnumbered long investors by 18 points, higher than last week's 12 points. This was most net shorts since Dec. 12, 2016, J.P. Morgan said. The shift in positionings came ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting this week, where analysts and traders widely expect the U.S. central bank to raise key short-term interest rates by a quarter point to 1.00-1.25 percent. This would mark the Fed's second rate increase in 2017. On the other hand, data showing U.S. inflation softening increased bets that Fed policy makers may slow their pace of rate increases. This view has stoked curve-flattening trades based on the notion that longer-dated Treasuries would fare better than shorter-dated issues in a low inflation environment. On Tuesday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was 2.209 percent, up from a near six-month low of 2.129 percent set a week earlier, according to Reuters data. Active clients, which included market makers and hedge funds, increased their bearishness on longer-dated Treasuries in the latest week, the J.P. Morgan survey showed. Half of those clients said they were short, up from 30 percent a week ago, while 10 percent said they were long, down from 10 percent last week. The rest said they were neutral, down from 50 percent a week earlier.

Buckeye and PDVSA had tried to resolve payment delays and other frequent problems that stalled some shipments, the sources said. But PDVSA decided to shift its oil to the Statia terminal, operated by U.S. NuStar Energy LP, in the neighboring island of St. Eustatius. The termination is another sign of how PDVSA's deteriorating finances have strained its relationship with business partners. The state-owned company has struggled to maintain its tanker fleet on the water and to keep operations running to maximize income for the country's most important export: oil.     PDVSA's contract with Buckeye had included storage for up to 6 million barrels of crude and fuel oil. The contract was due to expire in December, but PDVSA decided to end the lease in advance and seek some $10 million in overpayments, according to a source from the Venezuelan company. Buckeye and PDVSA did not respond to requests for comment. NuStar said it would not discuss customer activities at its terminals. Since 2016 Buckeye had intermittently suspended PDVSA from moving its stored oil out of the terminal - the Caribbean's largest - over monthly payment delays, according to sources from the companies and Thomson Reuters Trade Flows data. In late August, PDVSA renewed a 2014 contract with NuStar to secure its presence in Statia for three more years starting in March. The state-run company is now paying some $2.3 million per month to lease 5 million barrels of crude storage excluding extra charges, according to a document seen by Reuters. PDVSA's supply and trade department last year also approved an option to lease a single buoy mooring in St. Eustatius and extra storage capacity for up to 4.3 million barrels of refined products.  We are now consolidating blending and storage operations in St. Eustatius,  the PDVSA source said. NuStar's Statia terminal has capacity to store up to 13.03 million barrels of crude and products. It also has six mooring locations, blending and transshipment facilities.  In 2011, PDVSA announced a plan to increase storage capacity nearly fourfold in three years to handle new production of blends made from the Orinoco Belt's crudes. Since then, it has rented facilities in the Caribbean, but payment problems have recently affected its operations in several islands. PDVSA operates the 335,000-barrel-per-day Isla refinery in Curacao and an adjacent terminal. It also owns the BOPEC storage terminal in Bonaire, leases the Aruba refinery and its terminal through its subsidiary Citgo, and has stakes in refineries in the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Cuba. Buckeye's Bahamas terminal was owned by PDVSA until 2008, when it was sold to investment firm First Reserve Corp. In 2010, Buckeye bought 80 percent of the facility, which can store up to 26.2 million barrels of oil.  Buckeye also owns terminals in St. Lucia and Puerto Rico.

CVC bought a 60% stake in Stage Entertainment in 2015 from Dutch media tycoon Joop van den Ende, who retained a minority stake. Joop van den Ende co-founded Endemol in 1993 and then transferred all of its live entertainment activities into Stage Entertainment. In an unusual move, CVC paid all-equity for the business and aside from a small loan -- from a club of local Benelux banks -- the company has remained debt free, the sources said. “It is unusual but it was a smallish company and it felt like there were a lot of changes to be made. Sometimes buyout firms buy with 100% equity cheques for competitive reasons or because they feel they may not get the best financing deal, preferring to sit and wait to let a credit prove itself before raising debt,” a senior banker said. Much of the €335m term loan will be used to pay a dividend to owners as well as to refinance the local loan. Some of it will be put as cash on balance sheet, to help the continued growth of the company, the sources said. Barclays is leading the financing, alongside ABN Amro, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, ING and Morgan Stanley and a meeting is set to take place to show the deal to lenders on June 15, the sources said. CVC was not immediately available to comment. The financing is expected to be welcomed by Europe’s leveraged loan market eager to put new money to work after a number of repricings and refinancings this year. It will join a growing number of new issuers to launch this week including a €1bn financing backing Advent International’s buyout of European industrial supplies distributor IPH that will combine with Advent-owned peer Brammer and a US$1.225bn-equivalent euro-denominated term loan backing the take private of Hong Kong-based international schools operator Nord Anglia Education.

The inspection system was Egypt's answer to a near year-long row over stringent import requirements, including a ban on the common grain fungus ergot, a policy that halted Egypt's wheat trade last year when trading houses boycotted its state tenders. The suspension, which the government has 15 days to appeal, means the quarantine body that applied the ban will again handle the inspection process both in Egypt and abroad, though it does not necessarily imply a return to zero ergot, the lawyers said.   I have no idea what will happen with ergot, that's for the agriculture ministry to decide,  said Alaa Zaki, one of the lawyers on the case. The new system had stripped the agriculture quarantine body of its inspection powers, and moved the process to the trade ministry's General Organization for Export and Import Control (GOEIC). The case was brought by a group of quarantine inspection employees in their capacity as citizens, not by the body itself, as well as several other parties, including some connected to the health ministry, which also takes part in inspections. They said the new system illegally stripped the quarantine body of its powers and handed it to a trade ministry body ill-equipped to oversee inspections, allowing imports to enter with hazardous contaminants harmful to plant and animal health. Egypt's ban on ergot was reversed last year by a decree that came two months before the new inspection system. That decree is also being challenged in court in a related case, though a ruling could take several months, the lawyers said. 1 Mln Tonne Buying Spree Egypt's state grain buyer GASC has been buying wheat on international markets in recent weeks despite its ongoing local harvest, a time when it typically stops tendering. At a tender on Tuesday GASC bought 300,000 tonnes of wheat from Russia, Romania and Ukraine, taking its purchases to over one million tonnes in under a month. Traders have said the buying spree could signal an intention to stockpile wheat ahead of any fallout from the ruling. Egypt said on Monday it had collected 3.4 million tonnes of wheat from farmers so far during its harvest, which runs through July. It has said it is targeting between 3.5 and 4 million tonnes. GASC told Reuters last week that it intends to continue permitting up to 0.05 percent of ergot in its wheat purchases, a common international standard stipulated in its tender booklet. Egypt baffled traders last year when the agriculture quarantine body began rejecting wheat shipments with trace levels of ergot despite GASC's 0.05 percent permission level as well as reassurances from the ministries of supply and agriculture that they would not apply a zero standard. Tuesday's ruling will restore delegations of inspectors sent by the government to ports of origin abroad. They had been replaced by private companies under the new system.  The quarantine people who filed the case are worried that foreign inspectors don't care about Egypt's crop and the safety of the population,  said Mohamed Zaki, a quarantine inspector.

I think the sector rotation could go on for a while.  Investors are also likely to stay away from making big bets ahead of a near-certain interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Traders have priced in a 94 percent chance of the Fed raising rates after its two-day meeting that starts on Tuesday. Investors are also looking for more details on the central bank's plans to trim its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The Fed is expected to release its decision at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) on Wednesday followed by a press conference by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. At 11:01 a.m. ET the Dow Jones was up 37.31 points, or 0.18 percent, at 21,272.98, the S&P; 500 was up 2.7 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,432.09 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 10.22 points, or 0.17 percent, at 6,185.69. Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher. Amazon.com rose 0.7 percent, after recording losses for the past two days, and gave the biggest boost to the consumer discretionary index. Financials rose 0.4 percent, helped by gains in big banks after the U.S. Treasury Department announced a plan to make sweeping changes to banking regulations on Monday. The department proposed to reduce trading restrictions that big banks face, ease their annual stress tests, and curb the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  I think investors are unsure of real regulatory changes but this is enough talk to keep them interested,  Meckler said. Restaurant chain operator Cheesecake Factory was down nearly 10 percent at $52.61 after it warned of a decline in comparable store sales in the current quarter. Tesla was up 2.5 percent at $368.17 after Berenberg raised its rating on the stock to  buy  from  hold . Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,800 to 941. On the Nasdaq, 1,603 issues rose and 1,056 fell.

The Labor Department said prices for services rose 0.3 percent last month, driven by a 1.1 percent surge in the index for final demand trade services, which measures changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers.     U.S. three-year Treasury yields hit 1.511 percent, their highest since May 16, while two-year yields   touched their highest in a month of 1.367 percent after the data.      Yields eased from their session highs and were last roughly unchanged from their levels as of late Monday, with three- and two-year yields last at 1.500 percent and 1.359 percent, respectively.      Traders likely viewed the services price data as a harbinger of stronger May consumer price index data, which is set for release Wednesday, said John Herrmann, director of interest rates strategy at MUFG Securities in New York.      That potential inflation pickup would come after recent readings showing inflation moving away from the Fed's 2 percent goal, which have been viewed as a potential obstacle to more hawkish Fed policy.      The Fed is scheduled to release its decision at 2 p.m ET (1800 GMT) on Wednesday at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is due to hold a press conference a half hour later. The Fed is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest for the second time this year.      Herrmann of MUFG also said yields were pressured a bit higher given the risk that the Fed could provide more detail on its plans to shrink its bond portfolio.       The markets have to build in a little bit of risk that the Fed may say something about tapering tomorrow,  he said.      The Treasury will sell $12 billion in 30-year bonds on Tuesday at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT). U.S. 30-year yields were last at 2.866 percent, compared to 2.868 percent late Monday. Long-dated yields earlier hit 2.886 percent, their highest since June 1.       Some of (the earlier move higher in yields) is just ahead of the supply,  said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.     Benchmark 10-year Treasuries were last up 1/32 in price to yield 2.207 percent, compared to 2.213 percent late Monday.

Trump stepped up pressure for the repeal with a tweet Tuesday morning declaring that the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare,  is in a death spiral.  He cited the government's announcement Monday that some two million enrollees who signed up for Obamacare have dropped out this year. Although Trump's Republican party has a majority in both houses of Congress, Trump blamed the lack of progress in repealing President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement on  obstructionist  Democrats. The House of Representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month, but Senate Republicans have been unable to coalesce around their own version of a bill, with moderates and conservatives pushing in different directions in meetings behind closed doors. The group of 13 senators that Trump invited to lunch includes Republicans from both ideological camps: moderate Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were on the list, as well as conservative Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said senators are closer to bringing up a proposal, and other Republicans have predicted for some time that a bill would be ready for a vote before the August recess. One of the senators invited to Tuesday's lunch, Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, said late on Monday he did not expect a Senate healthcare bill to be unveiled this week.  I think we've got a little ways to go,  he told reporters.  There's a lot of things that have to be resolved.  One of the key issues is the fate of the expansion of Medicaid, the healthcare program for the poor, under the Affordable Care Act. Senators from states that expanded Medicaid are seeking a “glide path” that would phase out the additional federal funding for the program over a period of seven years starting in 2020, instead of the abrupt cutbacks in the federal funding starting in 2020 that are called for under the House bill. But conservatives would prefer less, and Senate leadership has suggested a three-year phase-out of Medicaid expansion.  Nothing been nailed down on that, so everything's still on the table,  Senator Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia, one of the states that expanded Medicaid, said on Monday.

A very grave mistake is being made in Qatar, isolating a nation in all areas is inhumane and against Islamic values. It's as if a death penalty decision has been taken for Qatar,  Erdogan said.  Qatar has shown the most decisive stance against the terrorist organization Islamic State alongside Turkey. Victimizing Qatar through smear campaigns serves no purpose.  Erdogan also said he would hold a conference call on Tuesday with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and the Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani to discuss recent developments. He said the Saudi King, as the elder statesman in the Gulf region, should take the lead to resolve the crisis. Erdogan is also due to discuss the dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump in coming days, Turkey's foreign minister said earlier on Tuesday.

New allegations in recent weeks of inappropriate collusion between state-owned companies and business interests close to Zuma have put more pressure on the scandal-plagued leader and ministers close to him. Gigaba has come under fire after Julius Malema, leader of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party, tweeted pictures of government documents showing Gigaba had fast-tracked the naturalization process for Gupta family members. In a statement, Gigaba confirmed the authenticity of the documents but denied they showed he had acted unlawfully.   I have requested the Department of Home Affairs to provide chronological details of how all applications by the Gupta family have been handled by the Department of Home Affairs from the beginning,  Gigaba said.  We have no doubt that the whole process has been handled by the book in terms of our laws.   He said it had been within his powers as home affairs minister to shorten the citizenship process and that such courtesies had been extended to business executives and sports people as well as the Gupta family members. Gigaba was appointed as finance minister in March, replacing Pravin Gordhan, a favorite of international investors, who was sacked by Zuma. The cabinet reshuffle prompted ratings agencies to downgrade Africa's most industrialized economy, citing heightened political risk. Gary van Staden, a political analyst at NKC Independent Economists said the allegations against Gigaba risked further undermining investors' confidence in South Africa, although they were unlikely to immediately impact investments.  South Africa depends on foreign investment to finance its big budget and balance of payments deficits. The EFF last week filed a criminal complaint against Gigaba  over what it says is evidence of corruption in a lucrative government tender. Gigaba and the Gupta family have denied doing any wrongdoing. Malema is the leader of the ultra-left EFF party which emerged as electoral kingmaker in Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria at municipal elections in August last year. A former protege of Zuma, he was expelled from the ruling African National Congress in 2011 for bringing the movement into disrepute.

The fashion company's £177m 8% 2023 senior notes touched 60 on the bid from 57.5 even though S&P; cut its rating to B- from B late on Monday.  It's been a Street short for a long time. The numbers (earnings) last week were just what the Street wanted. They managed to push the bonds down,  a trader told IFR.  It's a case of the Street now trying to cover its shorts.  On June 6, New Look released worse than expected annual results, triggering a huge slump in the bonds. On June 7 they plunged to a record low of 48.5, down nearly 30 points. Adjusted Ebitda fell 31% to £155m for the year ending March 25, largely due to a decline in UK sales on fears around Brexit. Even though the rot in the company's bonds has stopped for the time being, some investors remain doubtful about the outlook.  There might be a time when we see it as a buying opportunity. I feel there will be a point, especially on the senior side, when bonds look attractive,  a fund manager said.  But I think we need to get comfortable that there's been a bit of stabilization in the operations.  New Look is seeking to diversify its earnings away from the UK, expanding in China and Europe, and is also trying to boost its online presence. However, S&P; analysts also cut their outlook to negative, reflecting their opinion that  earnings will remain suppressed in the financial year to March 2018.  Analysts from Lucror Analytics, an independent research firm, emphasized exogenous pressures that could limit the company's recovery.  While efforts are underway to recover lost ground in the UK, it remains to be seen if these will suffice to offset the impact from the challenging macro environment, fashion risk and cost headwinds.  UK consumer spending took a hit for the first time in nearly four years in May, with figures from Visa showing a 0.8% decline versus May 2016, after adjusting for inflation. However, the high-yield market remains open to retail issuers, with online supermarket Ocado out with a £200m 7NC3 senior secured debut deal on which IPTs have been set at 4.5% area for pricing on Wednesday.  The general feeling is that the UK retailer will be under pressure but there are winners and losers within that sector,  the trader said.

A law the Slovenian government drafted in April would allow the country's Court of Audit to review central bank decisions that lead to the spending of public funds. According to it, the Court of Audit could review central bank decisions over the past 10 years. Local economists and the media have argued that the bank had demanded the state provide too much capital to help domestic banks to ward off a potential debt crisis in 2013.  The ECB questions whether a provision allowing for auditing Banka Slovenije's actions that have taken place during the last ten years is compatible with the principle of legal certainty,  the ECB said in a opinion dated June 12 and published on its website. It added that the independence of the Bank of Slovenia should be respected not only when it performs tasks related to the European System of Central Banks, of which it is a member,  but also when it performs national tasks . In 2013, the previous government had to pour more than 3 billion euros into local banks in order to prevent them from collapsing under a large amount of bad loans. The central bank says all procedures of the 2013 bank overhaul were in line with legislation, including the decision to annul shares and subordinated bonds in troubled banks. Last month, the Bank of Slovenia governor Bostjan Jazbec, who also sits on the ECB governing council, urged the government to reconsider its supervision plan, saying it was unprecedented in the euro zone. The finance ministry, which prepared the draft law, told Reuters it will take the ECB's opinion into consideration and ask the parliament to do so as well. The Bank of Slovenia was not available for an immediate comment. (Reporting by Marja Novak; Editing by Tom Heneghan)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/ecb-slovenia-idUSL8N1JA456"},

Prosecutors said Iliescu, Roman and several other officials at the time used police as well as miners and other workers to quash peaceful protests in Bucharest's iconic University Square, resulting in the death of four people.  Another 1,388 people were injured and 1,250 protesters were illegally detained during the clashes, which took place exactly 27 years ago on June 13-15. The protests against Iliescu's rise to power after the 1989 fall of communism broke out in April, one month before the country's first democratic election, which he won.  They carried on peacefully until June, when Iliescu summoned thousands of miners and workers from counties across the country to Bucharest to help police end what he and other officials called a fascist coup attempt.  State authorities ... decided to trigger a violent attack against University Square protesters,  prosecutors said in a statement.  The repression ... continued in a systematic attack together with miners and workers from several counties which had become a force parallel to the recognized legal ones.  Iliescu, now 87, has repeatedly denied accusations that he engineered the violence, which Western observers said had hampered Romania's transition to a market economy and deterred foreign investment for years.  Miners descended repeatedly on the capital in the first post-communist decade and were once a strong political force.

New allegations in recent weeks of inappropriate collusion between state-owned companies and business interests close to Zuma have put more pressure on the scandal-plagued leader and ministers close to him. Gigaba has come under fire after Julius Malema, leader of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party, tweeted pictures of government documents showing Gigaba had fast-tracked the naturalization process for Gupta family members. In a statement, Gigaba confirmed the authenticity of the documents but denied they showed he had acted unlawfully.   I have requested the Department of Home Affairs to provide chronological details of how all applications by the Gupta family have been handled by the Department of Home Affairs from the beginning,  Gigaba said.  We have no doubt that the whole process has been handled by the book in terms of our laws.   He said it had been within his powers as home affairs minister to shorten the citizenship process and that such courtesies had been extended to business executives and sports people as well as the Gupta family members. Gigaba was appointed as finance minister in March, replacing Pravin Gordhan, a favorite of international investors, who was sacked by Zuma. The cabinet reshuffle prompted ratings agencies to downgrade Africa's most industrialized economy, citing heightened political risk. Gary van Staden, a political analyst at NKC Independent Economists said the allegations against Gigaba risked further undermining investors' confidence in South Africa, although they were unlikely to immediately impact investments.  South Africa depends on foreign investment to finance its big budget and balance of payments deficits. The EFF last week filed a criminal complaint against Gigaba  over what it says is evidence of corruption in a lucrative government tender. Gigaba and the Gupta family have denied doing any wrongdoing. Malema is the leader of the ultra-left EFF party which emerged as electoral kingmaker in Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria at municipal elections in August last year. A former protege of Zuma, he was expelled from the ruling African National Congress in 2011 for bringing the movement into disrepute.

New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the two leaders spoke on the phone earlier this week, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Michal Maayan said in a statement.   I regret the damage done to Israel-New Zealand relations as a result of New Zealand proposing Resolution 2344 at the Security Council,  English wrote, according to the Foreign Ministry statement.

Continued settlement building on land Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War and which Palestinians hope will eventually form part of an independent state has drawn criticism from the United Nations and most of the international community. Palestinians cite it as a major obstacle in now-stalled peace talks. On June 4 Israel said it was returning its ambassador to Senegal, after recalling him over the U.N. Security Council resolution.

India's census found there were more than four million laborers aged between five and 14 in 2011 out of 168 million globally, but activists say millions more are at risk due to poverty. Indian Minister of Labour Bandaru Dattatreya said in statement the ratification reaffirmed the country's  commitment to a child labor free society.  The International Labour Organization's Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour and the Minimum Age Convention form the bedrock of global guidelines for countries to legislate nationally. Ratifying the conventions - which specify a minimum age of work and prohibit using minors in areas like armed conflict, prostitution or drug trafficking - means nations must adopt the standards and have their progress reviewed every four years. Paradigm Shift  Activist said successive governments had resisted ratification due to a general denial of the existence of child labor in India. Nobel Laureate and child rights activist Kailash Satyarthi called the ratifications a paradigm shift.  For years, India was saying we don't have child slavery and was hesitant to admit the worst forms of child labor exist here, but now this government has agreed that this is a problem and that is why we are ratifying the conventions,  he said. The ratifications would mean increased government spending on children, and also provide a strong legal tool for charities seeking to strengthen policy on child labor in the country's courts, Satyarthi added. India has one of largest populations of children in the world, with more than 40 percent of its 1.2 billion people below the age of 18, according to its 2011 census. An economic boom in the last two decades has lifted millions out of poverty and progress has been made in curbing child labor with the introduction of social welfare schemes and laws to protect minors and ensure education.  Nonetheless, India is home to more than 30 percent of the world's 385 million most impoverished children, according to a 2016 World Bank and UNICEF report. These children are easy prey for traffickers, who promise a better life but often end up selling them into forced labor or debt bondage. More than half of India's child workers are employed in agriculture and more than a quarter in manufacturing - embroidering clothes, weaving carpets or making match sticks.  Children also work in restaurants and hotels and as domestic workers. Many girls are sold to brothels for sexual slavery.

Euro zone finance ministers are to meet in Luxembourg on June 15 to discuss Greek reform progress, how to reduce debt, and possibly, bring the International Monetary Fund on board to participate financially in the country's third bailout.  The key is in accepting a proposal for a mechanism automatically linking medium-term debt measures with growth, bridging differences between institutions,  Tsipras told a cabinet meeting, referring to a proposal floated by France.  He said the compromise would allow positive assessments on the country's debt sustainability, now running at around 180 percent of gross domestic product.  Tsipras suggested that he would take the issue at an EU leaders' summit later this month, if the solution proposed on June 15 did not meet Greece's expectations.  The scope and timing of any potential debt relief has kept the International Monetary Fund on the sidelines of the bailout program, convinced that the country's indebtedness is unsustainable. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire expressed optimism about Greece reaching a deal on new loans from its European creditors after talks with his Greek counterpart and Tsipras in Athens.

Under the preliminary proposal, Renault (RENA.PA), Nissan (7201.T) and Mitsubishi (7211.T) would pay the Dutch-registered company a share of new synergies from their carmaking alliance, set to top 5.5 billion euros ($6.2 billion) next year. The funds would be passed on as cash and stock bonuses to  encourage executives to pursue synergy opportunities , according to a presentation by Ardea Partners, an investment banking firm advising Ghosn on closer alliance integration. Renault-Nissan spokeswoman Catherine Loubier said:  This article is not based on any information provided by the alliance or its member companies, and no such decisions have been made.  Loubier declined to comment further or respond to detailed questions from Reuters about the proposal and the relationship with Ardea Partners, which also declined to comment. Brazilian-born Ghosn, 63, is in open conflict with the French state, Renault's biggest shareholder, whose opposition to his CEO pay package was instrumental to its symbolic rejection in a non-binding vote at last year's shareholder meeting. His combined 15.6 million euros in Renault-Nissan pay amounted to the third-biggest haul among French CAC 40 company bosses. In response, Renault cut Ghosn's variable pay component by 20 percent and clarified bonus criteria. Shareholders will have their say again at the 2017 general meeting on Thursday, in a vote that has now become binding under French law. Renault shares fell more than 3 percent after this report was published and were down 2.7 percent at 83.69 euros as of 1453 GMT. Nissan had earlier closed 0.2 percent lower in Tokyo. Ghosn, who is also chairman of Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors and the Renault-Nissan BV alliance management organisation, said in February the government's near-20 percent Renault stake was blocking a full tie-up. The alliance bonus plan would seek to encourage Renault and its 44 percent-owned partner Nissan to operate more like a merged company without the need for actual ownership changes. It would create a new pool of executive pay - on top of existing bonus plans at the allied carmakers and Mitsubishi, in which Nissan took a controlling 34 percent stake last year. If implemented, the plan would likely draw criticism from some investors already concerned about compensation, governance issues and an ongoing French criminal probe into allegations of systematic Renault diesel emissions fraud. The company has denied any wrongdoing. No Disclosure Under the proposal seen by Reuters, the carmakers would pay in 8 percent of each annual increase in synergies achieved. In a hypothetical year where new projects with Mitsubishi saved 1 billion euros, 80 million would be added to the bonus pot. One-third of total awards would be reserved for the six top alliance roles - the chairman and CEO at each carmaker - of which four are currently occupied by Ghosn. The new Dutch private limited company, or BV, would be wholly owned by an independent foundation, the presentation states,  avoiding related-party issues  that would require compensation to be disclosed to the manufacturers' shareholders. It would also escape French payroll taxes.  The amounts paid through the service contracts would be disclosed each year in the respective accounts of the (alliance) members - although the amounts paid to each participant would not have to be legally disclosed,  it says. The incentive plan has Ghosn's backing, according to an accompanying memo dating from early June.  The scheme is still being worked out in detail,  it says. Renault and Nissan are due to update mid-term plans and integration goals later this year. London-based Ardea Partners was founded last year by Christopher Cole, a former Goldman Sachs banker who is close to Ghosn, as a private investment banking firm providing  strategic and financial advice to CEOs, founders and boards of directors of leading global enterprises facing complex challenges . In 2013, Cole and his Goldman teams worked on a full Renault-Nissan deal study piloted by Ghosn and a group of alliance managers, known internally as Project Caterpillar. It recommended a merger, but Ghosn instead unveiled a purely operational integration push early the following year.  It's an Ardea Partners-wide policy to never speak to the press,  Managing Director Robert Falzon said when contacted for this story.  Our chairman is very focused on this.  Succession The plan to reward cooperation may indicate that Ghosn sees little chance of a merger to cement the alliance he built and has run for 12 years, as he moves to hand over some powers. In April, Ghosn stepped aside as Nissan CEO, though he continues to oversee operations as chairman. Renault-Nissan is recruiting a new second-in-command, with several alliance managers in contention, Reuters reported on June 7. Senior Toyota (7203.T) executive Didier Leroy is also being considered, sources said this week. Furthermore, the bonus plan would increase pay for the chairman roles from which Ghosn is expected to continue directing alliance strategy for years, whether or not his Renault CEO contract is renewed in 2018.  It makes perfect sense,  said one senior Paris investment banker when told about the proposal.  The question is whether he can manage the storm this is going to create.  Pressure on Ghosn over pay had been easing ahead of Thursday's shareholder meeting, following the Renault pay concessions and his exit from the Nissan CEO role. ISS, an influential shareholder adviser that opposed Ghosn's pay last year, is urging clients to back his package, which may be enough to overcome the usual government opposition.

Based on other bond market indicators, they estimated the probability of a U.S. recession from now to June 2018 at less than 10 percent. This compared with the yield curve, or the gap between long-dated and short-dated yields, which currently implies roughly a 33 percent chance of a recession.  Despite this development, we do not see U.S. recession risk as particularly elevated; indeed, we think it is quite low for the next year,  Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a research note. Historically, a sharp flattening of the yield curve has preceded a recession as traders pile into longer-dated Treasuries in anticipation of an economic contraction. On Monday, the two-year to 10-year portion of the Treasury yield curve flattened to 83.80 basis points, its tightest since early October. It reached nearly 137 basis points in December, which was its steepest level in a year, Tradeweb data showed. Analysts and traders have attributed the curve flattening  to doubts about any forthcoming fiscal stimulus from Washington and recent economic data that fell short of expectations.   Still, some aspects of the U.S. economy such as the labor market and housing continue to perform well without signs they will overheat in the next 12 months, Deutsche Bank economists said. However, a further tightening of the labor market in the next 18 months might force the Federal Reserve to accelerate its pace of rate increases, raising the chances of a recession by 2020, according to the bank's economists.  The more hawkish scenario would clearly move the Fed's policy stance to a level that would make a recession likely by late-2019 or 2020,  they wrote. The Fed's policy setting committee holds a scheduled meeting later this week, at which it is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate to a target range of 1.00 to 1.25 percent.

Euro zone finance ministers are to meet in Luxembourg on June 15 to discuss Greek reform progress, how to reduce debt, and possibly, bring the International Monetary Fund on board to participate financially in the country's third bailout.  The key is in accepting a proposal for a mechanism automatically linking medium-term debt measures with growth, bridging differences between institutions,  Tsipras told a cabinet meeting, referring to a proposal floated by France.  He said the compromise would allow positive assessments on the country's debt sustainability, now running at around 180 percent of gross domestic product.  Tsipras suggested that he would take the issue at an EU leaders' summit later this month, if the solution proposed on June 15 did not meet Greece's expectations.  The scope and timing of any potential debt relief has kept the International Monetary Fund on the sidelines of the bailout program, convinced that the country's indebtedness is unsustainable. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire expressed optimism about Greece reaching a deal on new loans from its European creditors after talks with his Greek counterpart and Tsipras in Athens.  I wanted to underline that we are doing our best with the other member states of the euro zone, with the IMF, with the Greek government, and I'm optimistic.

Slower demand growth helped stall the acceleration of greenhouse gas emissions for a third year to levels not seen since the 1980s, but emissions remained well above targets set out globally under the 2015 Paris accord on climate change. Coal's share in the energy mix declined to its lowest since 2004 at around 28 percent, while production of the highly polluting fossil fuel saw its largest ever annual drop at 6.2 percent, BP said. Global energy demand grew by 1 percent in 2016, a rate similar to those seen in the previous two years but well below the 10-year average of 1.8 percent, the British company said in its benchmark Statistical Review of World Energy.  This is a third year where we've seen weak growth in world energy demand ... The new normal is that all of this growth is coming from developing economies,  particularly China and India, BP Chief Economist Spencer Dale told reporters. China's energy demand growth in 2015 and 2016, 1.2 and 1.3 percent respectively, although still the strongest in the world, marked its lowest over a two-year period since 1997-98. While that slowdown resulted from sluggish global economic activity, it also stemmed from greater efficiency in engines and factories, he said. Among fossil fuels, oil demand grew at the fastest annual rate - 1.6 percent - last year as low crude prices boosted consumption.  Oil production grew by half a percent, or 400,000 barrels per day, the lowest gain since 2009, as energy companies slashed spending. U.S. shale, or tight, oil production fell dramatically last year but has rebounded strongly in recent months as oil prices rose, a factor the market should get used to, Dale said.  U.S. tight oil is like a Weeble: It falls off but then it bounces back up again,  Dale said.  Any sense of trying to kill tight oil makes no sense.  As oil demand growth continues to outstrip production growth, global oil stocks - which have plagued the market since 2014 - will start falling  more materially  in the second half of this year, Dale said. Gas saw similar growth to oil. Cheaper and abundant gas supplies in the United States and China's drive to switch to cleaner feedstock for its power plants led to a 1.7 percent drop in demand for coal, the most pollutant fossil fuel.  It feels to me like we are seeing a decisive break in coal relative to the past,  Dale said. Renewables Surge Renewables such as solar and wind power were the fastest-growing source of energy, rising by 12 percent and accounting for a third of the overall growth in demand. Still, renewables provide only 4 percent of the world's primary energy. China, meanwhile, overtook the United States for the first time as the largest producer of renewable power. The slowing growth in energy demand, the shift to cleaner fuels and energy efficiency meant carbon emissions grew by 0.1 percent last year, similar to the prior two years, making it the lowest three-year average for emissions growth since 1981-83.  While welcome, it is not yet clear how much of this break from the past is structural and will persist.

The Islamic bond with a 7-year tenor will go on sale on June 28 for three days via book building, the DMO said. The bond will be tradable on the Nigerian Stock Exchange and on FMDQ over-the-counter platform. Nigeria is home to the largest Islamic population in sub-Saharan Africa, with about half of its 180 million people Muslims. It is also home to one of Africa's fastest-growing consumer and corporate banking sectors. The DMO said the issue was  part of the plan to fast track the development of infrastructure and engage in ... project-tied capital raising.  It said Nigeria has challenges with road, railway and power infrastructures. In 2013, Nigeria's Osun State issued 10 billion naira worth of sukuk, but no other sukuk transaction followed. The latest issuance is part of plans to develop alternative funding sources for government and to establish a benchmark curve for corporates to follow, the debt office said. The planned sukuk issue will target retail and institutional investors, with First Bank and Islamic wealth manager Lotus Capital managing the sale. Nigeria plans to borrow as much as $10 billion from debt markets, with about half of that coming from foreign sources, to help fund a budget deficit worsened by lower oil prices which have slashed government revenues and weakened the naira . It hopes to fund more than half of its budget deficit of 2.36 trillion naira this year from local borrowing. It also plans to tap concessionary sources to fill its funding needs and has been in talks with the World Bank since last year. On Monday, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, standing in for President Muhammadu Buhari, signed a 7.44-trillion naira spending plan for 2017 into law. The DMO is on a roadshow this week to Britain, Switzerland and the United States to market a $300 million Diaspora bond to Nigerians living abroad.

The offering comes over a year after Apple issued its first green bond of $1.5 billion - the largest issued by a U.S. corporation - as a response to the 2015 Paris agreement.  Apple said its second green bond is meant to show that businesses are still committed to the goals of the 194-nation accord. “Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change and protect our shared planet,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives.  Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was one of several CEOs who directly appealed to Trump to keep the United States in the pact before he made his decision. The tech giant said proceeds from the green bond sales will be used to finance renewable energy, energy efficiency at Apple facilities and in its supply chain and procuring safer materials for its products.  The offering also includes a specific focus on helping Apple meet a goal of greening its supply chain and using only renewable resources or recycled material, reducing its need to mine rare earth materials.  Last year, Apple allocated $442 million to 16 different projects from renewable energy to recycling from its first bond offer. One of the projects it funded was a robotic system called Liam to take apart junked iPhones and recover valuable materials that can be recycled, such as silver and tungsten - an attempt to address criticism that Apple's products, while sleek and seamless in design, are so tightly constructed that their components can be difficult to take apart.  Although green bonds comprise a small fraction of the overall bond market, demand has grown significantly as investors seek lower-carbon investments. In 2016, $81 billion of green bonds were issued, double the number from 2015, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, an organization that promotes the use of green bonds. Governments are also embracing the use of green bonds as a way to meet a 2015 pledge by world leaders to limit global warming this century to below 2 degrees Celsius.

The Bank of Tanzania said it has directed commercial banks to implement capital charges over operational risks with effect from August.  The minimum core and total capital ratios will remain 10 percent and 12 percent respectively ... but banks and financial institutions shall be required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet exposures,  it said in a statement. The new capital requirements are part of the east African country's efforts to implement Basel III guidelines, brought in globally after the 2008/09 financial crisis highlighted the need for banks to be more resilient to credit stresses.  The bank has also started developing rules for implementation of Basel II/III in order to make sure that the existing supervision practices are in line with the internationally accepted standards,  the central bank said. After shutting down a small bank last month over capital adequacy concerns, it also warned Tanzanian banks against a rise in non-performing loans (NPLs). Analysts said a steep increase in bad loans coupled with a sharp decline in credit to the private sector are threatening to undermine growth in one of the region's biggest economies.  The Bank of Tanzania has continued to implement prudential measures to strengthen risk management practices in the financial sector and has directed banks with high NPL ratios to formulate and implement strategies to bring the ratio to at most 5 percent,  said the central bank. It said the ratio of non-performing loans to gross loans in Tanzania's banking sector rose to 10.8 percent at the end of April 2017 from 8.2 percent a year ago. Tanzania's regulator cut the minimum reserve ratio required of commercial lenders to 8 percent from 10 percent in March, part of monetary easing measure aimed at reducing borrowing costs and stimulating economic growth. The change to the statutory minimum reserve requirement (SMR), which took effect in April, follows the central bank's decision to slash its discount rate to 12 from 16 percent. Lending to the private sector grew by 2.5 percent in 2016 after expanding 26.8 percent a year earlier. New lending to the agriculture, construction, transport and communication sectors was dramatically curtailed after a spike in bad loans. Tanzania has been taking measures to clean up its financial services sector, with licenses of some banks being revoked. The sector grew 10.7 percent in 2016 from 11.8 percent a year ago.

May's botched election gamble forced her to seek a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), increasing the influence of pro-British unionists who have struggled for years with Irish nationalists who want Northern Ireland to join a united Ireland. One of the architects of the settlement that brought an end to three decades of violence in Northern Ireland, Major said he was concerned that May's reliance on the DUP could create the perception that London was no longer an honest broker.  I am concerned about the deal. I am wary about it. I am dubious about it,  Major, who served as prime minister from 1990 to 1997, told BBC radio. Major warned that although Northern Ireland was a long way from returning to the violence that killed 3,600 people, he believed the peace process remained fragile nearly two decades after a U.S.-brokered 1998 peace agreement.  We have seen in Northern Ireland over very many years that events always don't unwind as you expect them to unwind,  he said.  We need to hope for the best but prepare for the worst.  The last thing anybody wishes to see is one or other of the communities so aggrieved that the hard men, who are still there lurking in the corners of the communities, decide that they wish to return to some form of violence.  Major said London's impartial role in Northern Ireland remained a fundamental part of the peace process.  The danger is that however much any government tries, they will not be seen to be impartial if they're locked into a parliamentary deal at Westminster with one of the Northern Ireland parties,  he said. Major said his list of concerns included how a post-Brexit Britain would resolve the issue of the Northern Ireland border with Ireland, the UK's only land border with the European Union. Any hard border, he said, would be catastrophic. Major said he sympathised with May and her need to shore up her position, but he urged her to consult more widely on her approach to Brexit, saying he thought the so-called hard Brexit was  increasingly unsustainable . May met the DUP leader Arlene Foster on Tuesday to discuss a deal for support in parliament. Foster said discussions were going well.

Thummel,US,USA,OIL,HEDGES,Energy Markets,Company News,Western Europe,Crude Oil,Energy (Legacy),Derivatives,Corporate Events,Oil and Gas Exploration and Production (TRBC),Oil and Gas (TRBC),Oil and Gas Refining and Marketing (TRBC),Hedge Funds,Government Borrowing Requirement,Graphics,Shale Oil / Shale Gas,Europe,United Kingdom,Pictures,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply.  The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.  However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC's efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.  The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.  For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.  Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.  According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.  In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.    Infographic ID: '2rolpok'     Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.       A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,  said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.      Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.  Underhedged Anxieties  Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.  The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.  Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.   I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,  said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.  Some New Players  In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.  Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.  Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.   Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,  said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

Shaw said it would pay C$430 million ($325 million) to acquire wireless spectrum from Quebecor Media Inc, which is majority-owned by Quebecor Inc, for use in its home markets in Alberta and British Columbia as well as in southern Ontario. The moves are the latest one-two M&A; punch from Shaw, after early last year selling its media assets to sister company Corus Entertainment and acquiring Wind Mobile, which it rebranded as Freedom Mobile in November. Shares of both Shaw and Quebecor jumped after the news, with Shaw up 4.2 percent to C$29.75 and Quebecor up 1.9 percent at C$41.35 in morning trade.  It was a good price (for ViaWest), a good strategic move to focus back onto the core,  said Jeff Fan, a telecom analyst at Scotiabank, adding that the price they paid for the Quebecor spectrum was at the high end of his expected range. Calgary-based Shaw is locked in a fierce battle for internet, television and telephone customers in the west of the country with Vancouver-based rival Telus Corp.  Just by getting low-band spectrum it's not going to put them on equal footing, but it does narrow the network quality gap quite significantly,  Scotiabank's Fan said. The spectrum transaction requires approvals from a competition watchdog and the government, and is expected to close this summer. Analysts were calling on Shaw to sell its data center business after U.S. telecommunications firms Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc reaped several billions of dollars after agreeing to sell their portfolios last year. Shaw bought ViaWest from private equity firms Oak Hill Capital Partners and GI Partners for about $1.2 billion three years ago. Peak 10 Holding is owned by GI Partners. ViaWest is a Colorado-based data center company which offers hybrid IT and cloud-based solutions. It owns about 30 data centers in several U.S. states including Colorado, Nevada and Minnesota. Reuters reported in April that Shaw was looking for a buyer for ViaWest and was expecting a higher price than its original investment. TD Securities acted as exclusive financial adviser and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Dentons Canada LLP provided legal advice, Shaw said.

The Brazilian planemaker is in negotiations that are in various stages with around ten countries, including Sweden and New Zealand, for the military cargo jet, according to the sources, after six nations showed formal interest during early development.  The Brazilian Air Force has ordered 28 of the aircraft for 7.2 billion reais ($2.2 billion), with two deliveries set for 2018 and three in 2019.  Among foreign governments, talks with the Portuguese are the most advanced after Lisbon authorized negotiations for five KC-390s, the sources said. One said there may be an option for a sixth KC-390 focused on domestic firefighting missions. Common shares of Embraer rose 0.6 percent to 15.75 reais in Sao Paulo trading, trimming year-to-date losses to 0.5 percent.   Embraer does not comment on potential sales,  the company said in a statement. The new cargo jet represents a bid by Embraer to take a bite out of a military transport segment long dominated by the workhorse Hercules C-130, made by U.S. aerospace firm Lockheed Martin Corp. Embraer has previously forecast a market worth over $50 billion in the coming decades to replace more than 700 older Hercules aircraft, some of them in service since the 1960s. Portugal, a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was one of the first countries to express interest in the KC-390 in 2010, along with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and the Czech Republic. Embraer's Portuguese subsidiary OGMA has helped to build the jet's fuselage and other parts. Chief Executive Paulo Cesar Silva said last month he was  very confident  Embraer would get its first KC-390 order from outside of Latin America this year.  In April, Embraer's defense unit head Jackson Schneider said the KC-390 could yield the company $1.5 billion in annual exports once the jet enters service next year.

UK law firm Harcus Sinclair and Dutch Foundation  Stichting Volkswagen Car Claim , a U.S.-style class action on behalf of an estimated 180,000 Dutch VW car owners, have teamed up in a move that could spark a wave of coordinated litigation across Europe. VW, Europe's biggest carmaker, has said about 11 million cars worldwide were fitted with software to cheat diesel emissions tests that are designed to limit car fumes blamed for respiratory diseases and global pollution.  The company has already agreed to spend up to $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and has offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. But it has not reached a similar deal in Europe and faces billions of euros in claims from customers and investors. The carmaker has offered European drivers a software update for all affected vehicles, but lawyers say this does not resolve the problem and they are demanding adequate compensation.  The Dutch Foundation, which says it has been trying to reach a  reasonable settlement  with VW since 2015, said it was also   cooperating  with partners representing drivers in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and was in talks with others in Spain, France, Italy, Poland, the Czech Republic and Scandinavia.   We are delighted to be teaming up with Harcus Sinclair UK Limited, who have done an excellent job in paving the way for car owners to seek redress from VW through the courts,  said Guido van Woerkom, director of the foundation. The expanding lawsuit is seeking compensation for damage suffered by VW, Audi, SEAT, Skoda and/or Porsche car owners, alleging VW and supplier Bosch were responsible for the sale of cars that breached toxic nitrogen oxides emissions rules.  To date, the owners of the 8.5 million affected European cars remain in the cold,  said Harcus Sinclair, which launched its case in January 2016 and has signed up about 41,000 English and Welsh VW drivers. A London trial is expected in early 2019.  VW said it took the trust of its customers very seriously, but it saw no legal basis for consumer lawsuits, as its plans to fix cars in Europe had been coordinated with regulators and price fluctuations for diesel cars were within a  normal range .  All vehicles affected are and have been technically safe and roadworthy. They can be driven on roads without any limitations and can be sold without loss in residual value,  it said in a statement.  Even if we were to hold talks with law firms we would maintain this position.

On Monday, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals became the second federal appeals court to reject the Republican Trump administration's bid to undo a Hawaii federal judge's decision that blocked the temporary travel ban in a dispute headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The three-judge panel said Trump's March 6 order violated existing immigration law, but did not address whether it was unconstitutional discrimination against Muslims.  Trump's 90-day ban targets travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.   Well, as predicted, the 9th Circuit did it again - Ruled against the TRAVEL BAN at such a dangerous time in the history of our country. S.C.  Trump said in a post on Twitter, apparently referencing the U.S. Supreme Court. The nation's top court, which leans conservative after Trump's appointee won confirmation as the ninth justice earlier this year, could act as soon as this week on his administration's request to reinstate the order. The 9th Circuit, headed by Democratic appointees, largely left in place a nationwide injunction by Judge Derrick Watson of Hawaii that stopped parts of the order, which Trump contends is needed to prevent terrorism in the United States.  Those who have challenged the travel ban dispute that it is needed to protect Americans and argue that the order violates the U.S. Constitution's bar against favoring or disfavoring a particular religion. Another appeals court, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, last month upheld a Maryland judge's ruling that also blocked Trump's ban.  Trump has been on the losing side in all four court rulings on the March order and has asked the U.S. Supreme Court for an emergency review. In a statement on Monday, U.S. Attorney General Sessions said Trump's executive order was lawful and that the court rulings have had a  chilling effect  on security operations.

The Treasury Department on Monday released a long list of suggested changes to banking rules, and said most of them could be carried out by agencies now, or soon to be, headed by Trump appointees. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law gave those agencies great leeway in how to interpret the rules. The only speed bump is the lack of appointees in place. Just one of Trump's financial regulatory nominees has been approved by Congress, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Jay Clayton. Other agencies are operating under  acting  chiefs or have leaders appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Here are some of the changes suggested in Monday's report that could be done without Congress. Stress Tests * Change the timing of the tests to a two-year cycle and the scenarios used to assess if banks can weather a crisis * End assumption that firms will continue to make capital distributions in distressed times * Make models and other parameters in the test subject to public comment and de-emphasize the qualitative review at the Federal Reserve * Clarify the capital buffers banks would have in the severely adverse scenario and make the method of calculating operational risk capital requirements more transparent AGENCIES: Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Living Wills * Change the timing of submitting the plans for how a bank would unwind in a crisis without a bailout to once every two years * Develop specific guidance for submissions * Make the assessment framework subject to public comment AGENCIES: Federal Reserve, FDIC Volcker Rule * Only banks with at least $10 billion in trading assets and liabilities will have to prove compliance with this rule * Match compliance requirements to the risk profiles of banks' activities * Eliminate unnecessary reporting requirements * Simplify the definition of  covered funds   AGENCIES: Fed, OCC, FDIC, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Enforcement * Issue rules or guidance for public comment rather than create rules via enforcement * Only levy fines on violators that have received reasonable notice they broke the law * Make no-action letters easier to obtain * Prosecute charges in federal district court instead of administrative proceedings AGENCY: Consumer Finance Protection Agency (CFPB) Mortgages *Change some loan qualifications and standards for determining borrowers' debt and income levels * Raise the loan amount that can have its points and fees capped to encourage smaller balance loans * Ease the way to correct errors found after a sale has closed  *Make the loan-originator compensation rule more flexible, * Place a moratorium on new rules for mortgage servicing * Help secondary market investors understand their assignee liability * Change the risk assessment of securitized products Agencies: Cfpb, Sec International Standards * Revisit rules on the additional capital charges on major U.S. banks and the mandatory minimum debt ratio * Establish a global risk-based capital floor * Consider the implications for the United States of implementing Basel III's approach for credit risk * Lead efforts to narrow the scope of new standard-setting initiatives and advocate for standards that align with domestic regulatory objectives  AGENCIES: Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC (This version of the story corrects 'LIVING WILLS' section to delete reference to removing FDIC from reviewing living wills, which requires congressional approval).

The nearly 150-page report suggested more than 100 changes, most of which would be made through regulators rather than Congress, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview. (bit.ly/2sVxOlt)  We were very focused on, what we can do by executive order and through regulators,  he said.  We think about 80 percent of the substance in the report can be accomplished by regulatory changes, and about 20 percent by legislation.  Republican President Donald Trump has gradually been nominating heads of financial agencies to carry out his agenda, but only Mnuchin and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton have been approved by Congress. Other agencies are operating under  acting  chiefs or have leaders appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Related CoverageFactbox: The Wall Street rules Trump could overhaul without CongressChanges proposed by the Treasury Department include easing up on restrictions big banks now face in their trading operations, lightening the annual stress tests they must undergo, and reducing the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has been aggressively pursuing bad behavior by financial institutions. The plan would also expand the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is chaired by Mnuchin, and change the way global capital standards are implemented to give U.S. banks a leg up against foreign rivals. Smaller banks would get some relief as well: Lenders with $50 billion or less in assets would have to jump through fewer regulatory hoops than rivals with multitrillion-dollar balance sheets. The industry has long sought many of the proposed changes, which would mostly benefit banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N). Industry trade groups applauded the proposal on Monday evening, though some said they wished there were more specifics on tricky questions, such as what level regulators should set for banks' assets before subjecting them to stricter rules.  This is the first time in a while where there's been an official undertaking where our concerns resonated with the folks in the driver's seat,  said Rich Foster, senior counsel for regulatory and legal affairs at the Financial Services Roundtable, a trade group. Representatives for the six largest U.S. banks declined to comment, did not immediately respond or said they were reviewing the document. Reform advocates and Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the plan as a handout to Wall Street and a dangerous one for U.S. consumers who lost homes and jobs during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a critic of Wall Street, said it would  make it easier for big banks to cheat their customers and spark another financial meltdown.  Her Democratic colleague Senator Sherrod Brown noted that Treasury consulted with industry groups more than consumer groups, by a ratio of 17-to-1, while developing its report.  The Treasury proposal advances ideas that have been pushed by industry lobbyists since Dodd-Frank was passed,  said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform.  We need more effective regulation and enforcement, not rollbacks driven by Wall Street and predatory lenders.  Mnuchin said the regulatory overhaul is needed to grow the economy, give consumers more choices and ensure U.S. taxpayers would not have to bail out big banks again. While the Trump administration has said it wants to protect consumers, existing rules limit their access to loans and investment products they want. By trying to make many of the changes through regulatory agencies, the Trump administration may avoid a lengthy and perhaps futile battle with Democratic lawmakers. Although the White House and Congress are led by Republicans, Democrats in the Senate can block legislation and are unlikely to support any overhaul that eases rules on big banks. Some of the Treasury's proposals, like defanging the CFPB, would require new laws to be written and therefore face an uphill political battle. The report, which focused on banks, is the first of four examinations being carried out by the Treasury Department after Trump pledged to do a  big number  on the Dodd-Frank reform law. Proposals on capital markets, clearing houses and derivatives as well as the insurance and asset management industries and financial innovation and banking technology will come later.

The overall credit quality of performing mortgages was high, with 59% rated NAIC CM1 with strong credit metrics and 32% rated CM2 with adequate metrics. Despite strong mortgage performance, U.S. life insurers could be exposed to credit concerns tied to aggressive underwriting in hotel and multifamily, which are further along the commercial real estate cycle. Other concerns include new construction in certain markets and an increasing amount of interest-only loans as a percentage of total loans. Investment in mortgages grew 7.5% in 2016 to $389 billion for life insurers in Fitch's universe, which remained strong relative to the prior-year growth rate of 7.7%.  Investment in mortgage loans over the last two years by life insurers was above historical growth rates for the industry as life insurers continue to trade liquidity for yield,  said Nelson Ma, Director, Fitch Ratings. In 2016, approximately 90% of life insurers in Fitch's rating universe experienced some degree of growth in their mortgage portfolio. Mortgage allocations of life insurers for the industry have largely increased beyond historical allocations of between 8% and 12%, with the average allocation at 11.9% at year-end 2016. Approximately one-fifth of companies in Fitch's universe had mortgage allocations above 17%, which the agency views as above-average and potentially more vulnerable in a declining real estate scenario. A number of companies with above-average mortgage concentrations have a demonstrated track record of good performance within this asset class during the financial crisis. Additionally, some of the life insurers with above-average concentrations to mortgages have well diversified mortgage portfolios by type. The companies with the greatest year-over-year increases in mortgage loans were a mix of relatively newer entrants to the mortgage loan market and those with substantial mortgage holdings. While commercial mortgages remained the dominant type of new mortgage on a notional basis, the net growth rate of residential mortgages, particularly multifamily and single family, and mezzanine loans were strong in 2016. Commercial properties accounted for 74% of total mortgages, followed by multifamily mortgages at 13%. Life insurers' net investment in CMBS increased 8% at year-end 2016 to $121 billion, or 3.9% of cash and invested assets. However, unlike the increase in mortgage loan investments that was almost industrywide, the relative year-to-year change in CMBS investment was mixed at the individual company level as the net industry increase was driven by larger increases in approximately one-quarter of life insurer's in Fitch's universe. Roughly 40% of life insurers had net decreases in CMBS exposure in 2016. Real estate sector fundamentals continue to build on the positive trends observed in recent years. However, certain markets with significant exposure to oil and gas or large amounts of new construction could face challenges in the coming years.

Poloz said that the central bank's 2015 interest rate cuts  have largely done their work,  signaling that the BOC could raise interest rates sooner than previously thought. Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said late on Monday that first-quarter growth in the North American country had been  pretty impressive,  and that signs economic growth was broadening would lead the central bank to consider whether current low rates would still be required. While many economists had expected the bank to start raising rates in 2018, markets are now pricing in a 72 percent chance of a hike by the end of 2017 following Wilkins's speech.  It's one of the biggest moves we’ve seen over the past year  in the Canadian dollar, said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto.  That’s dragging some of the dollar bloc currencies with it.  The move higher for the loonie could have implications for the Australian and New Zealand dollars, McCormick said, as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and Bank of Australia hold meetings over the next few weeks. Speculators have more than 120,000 short contracts on the Canadian dollar, with net short bets remaining near a record high, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters.  The market had been overlooking the strengthening economic data from Canada, and obviously now that we’re starting to see some change in communication from the Bank of Canada to acknowledge that ... the market won’t be able to look through that,  said MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman, in London.  The shift to a more hawkish stance will offer the potential for the Canadian dollar to strengthen further from here.

In a 57-page report issued on Tuesday, Adrangi said the Carlsbad, California-based company that beams satellite Internet to rural homes provides  inferior technology in a hyper- competitive market.  Kerrisdale holds an unspecified short position in the stock. Investors, Adrangi predicted, will soon realize that the  satellite-based residential internet is a business in terminal secular decline,  and push its stock price significantly lower.  According to Adrangi, who gained attention with successful bets against Chinese internet companies, the stock price should be trading closer to $35 a share not $71.63, where it closed on Monday. Since the start of the year it has fallen 1.15 percent but has gained 85 percent over the last five years. In the $3 trillion hedge fund world, Adrangi's $150 million Kerrisdale Capital is a tiny player that relishes attacking big targets. In October 2014 Kerrisdale unveiled a short bet against $2 billion Globalstar Inc which sent the stock price tumbling 25 percent. Last year, Adrangi bet against direct broadcast service provider DISH Network Co, a move that has not worked out and led to a loss at Kerrisdale.  This time, Adrangi is not just taking aim at ViaSat but also at Seth Klarman's $29 billion Baupost Group, a hedge fund that is ViaSat's largest investor with 13.2 million shares or 22.8 percent.  What had us scratching our heads about Baupost's  involvement is how it has been a top three holding for eight years even as prospects for the business and the competitive environment have been in a constant state of change with the outlook for satellite home broadband worsening each year,  Adrangi said in an interview. He did not mention the fund or its manager by name in the report. Adrangi said the company is trying to disguise its  doomed business  through aggressive accounting tactics like inflating average revenue per user through add-ons like  priority access  customer support.

But anyone relying on state TV would have concluded they were a non-event. Vremya, state TV's flagship evening news show, relegated news of the protests to item nine of 10, and, in a report lasting around 30 seconds, said less than 2,000 people had shown up in Moscow. Some 150 people had been detained for disobeying the police elsewhere in the city, it said. The main news of the day, according to Vremya, had instead been President Vladimir Putin's handing out of state awards. The Internet, awash with images and videos of police hauling people off across the country and, in at least one case, of a protester being punched, had a different take. A live feed organized by opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was detained in Moscow before he could attend what the authorities said was an illegal protest, showed demonstrations in scores of cities from Vladivostok to St Petersburg and thousands of people converging on central Moscow. Other footage showed some protesters chanting  Russia without Putin  and  Down with the Tsar.    The competing versions of one day in Vladimir Putin's Russia highlight the battle being fought between state TV, where most Russians get their news, and the Internet, which Putin critic Navalny is using to try to unseat the veteran Russian leader.  Related CoverageMoscow's mayor calls anti-Putin protests 'dangerous provocation': InterfaxGermany criticizes arrests of Russian demonstratorsAhead of a presidential election in March which Putin is expected to contest and that Navalny hopes to run in, the battle for Russians' hearts and minds is escalating. On the face of it, the contest is one-sided. Polls show that Putin, who has dominated Russian political life for the last 17 years, will comfortably win if he stands, while a poll last month said only 1 percent would vote for Navalny.     Putin has enjoyed glowing Soviet-style coverage on state TV for almost two decades. Navalny barely gets a look in, and if he does it is inevitably a negative reference.  The Kremlin and top government officials deliberately try not to mention his name, and state TV largely ignored Navalny's last big protests, in March, too. Dmitry Kiselyov, anchor of Russia's main weekly TV news show  Vesti Nedeli,  explained then that his show had ignored the demonstrations, the largest since 2012, because he viewed Navalny as a corrupt political chancer. Riot police detain a demonstrator during an anti-corruption protest in central St. Petersburg, Russia, June 12, 2017.Anton Vaganov Our Western colleagues would have done exactly the same,  said Kiselyov. Handed a five-year suspended prison sentence in February for embezzlement, Navalny says he is not corrupt and that the conviction was politically-motivated to try to kill off his presidential campaign. The 41-year-old lawyer has been trying to use the Internet to circumvent what he says is a TV blackout. He has set up his own You Tube channel, which has over 300,000 subscribers, become a prolific social media poster, and regularly circulates clips of himself criticizing Putin, 64, whom he calls  the old man.  Partly funded by supporters' campaign contributions, his online push has had some success, particularly among school children and students, though his support base includes older people, too, who typically live in Russia's big cities.     Slideshow (3 Images)A video he made accusing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, a Putin ally, of living a luxury lifestyle far outstripping his official salary, has so far racked up more than 22 million online views. Medvedev said the allegations were nonsense. Navalny's detractors have gone online too.  A video likening him to Adolf Hitler has racked up over 2 million views on You Tube, as has a music video released ahead of Monday's protests by pop singer Alisa Voks who urged young fans to  stay out of politics  and do their homework instead. Businessman Alisher Usmanov, whom Navalny targeted in his Medvedev video, also used the Internet to hit back, making two videos of his own questioning Navalny's probity. Navalny's critics, including some other anti-Kremlin politicians, accuse him of holding dangerously nationalist views and of having denigrated migrants in the past. Navalny says he is able to talk to, and connect with, different parts of the electorate.       Serving out a 30-day jail sentence for his role in organizing Monday's protests, Navalny has mocked his opponents' efforts to use the Internet. He says his Medvedev video has been watched by more people than some TV programs, but for now he says state TV has the upper hand.  Right now TV is more effective,  he told supporters after his release from jail in April after the last round of protests.  But we're looking for new methods. We need to keep making videos.

The impact of the fall in the pound since last year's Brexit vote made itself felt as the higher costs of foreign holidays and of imported computer games and equipment helped push up consumer prices by 2.9 percent year-on-year. That was its biggest annual increase since June 2013, the Office for National Statistics said, and was above the median forecast of 2.7 percent in a Reuters poll of economists. It is also faster than the growth in pay for most people who have suffered a squeeze on their incomes almost without break for a decade. Data due to be released on Wednesday is likely to show basic pay rose by an annual 2.0 percent in the three months to April, according to another Reuters poll. Prime Minister Theresa May, weakened by the loss of her parliamentary majority in the election, has accepted that voters' patience with austerity is at an end, the Times  reported on Tuesday. Despite the stronger-than-expected consumer price inflation figures, the pound fell slightly after the ONS data, possibly reflecting a slowing of the surge in prices faced by factories which hints at slower inflation ahead for households. Paul Hollingsworth, an economist with Capital Economics, said he believed the data showed the drop in the pound has fed through into inflation more quickly than expected.  While we think that CPI inflation will peak at a little above 3 percent before the end of this year, it is likely to drop back fairly quickly in 2018,  he said. The ONS said one of the main drivers for inflation in May was the increased cost of package holidays abroad for British tourists who have to pay more for their euros and dollars. Another big push on prices came from computer games and equipment, which are typically imported and therefore reflect the diminished buying power of sterling since the Brexit vote.     Inflation has picked up speed broadly around the world but in Britain there is extra pressure from the fall in sterling, contributing to a sharp slowdown in British economic growth since the start of this year. A shopper carries a basket in a supermarket in London, Britain April 11, 2017.Neil HallCredit card firm Visa said on Monday it saw the first annual fall in spending by consumers in nearly four years in May. That was before last week's shock election result that has raised questions about how May will advance her plans to take Britain out of the European Union, and push other legislation. A survey of executives published on Monday showed business confidence plunging after the election. Factory Costs Surge Easing Despite the sharp rise in prices, the Bank of England is widely expected to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25 percent when it announces its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday. The BoE has said it will tolerate inflation above its target of 2 percent because so far there has been no knock-on effect on pay which could generate a longer-lasting inflation problem. But the BoE had previously said it only expected inflation to reach the kind of levels it has now hit at the end of this year.  Some economists have said Britain's political turmoil is likely to make the BoE more cautious about considering a rate hike and could even lead it to revive its massive bond-buying program if the economy weakens further. The BoE was also likely to take comfort from the data which showed inflationary pressures might be easing. Input prices for factories fell by 1.3 percent in month-on-month terms in May, taking the yearly rate of price growth down to 11.6 percent from a downwardly revised 15.6 percent in April, its slowest annual growth rate since last September. Growth in prices charged by factories held steady at an annual 3.6 percent, in line with the Reuters poll.

Sears Canada's shares slumped as much as 56 percent to 50 Canadian cents in early trading, as investors fretted about whether the company would be able to weather this liquidity crisis before it found a buyer. The company was valued at about C$51 million ($38.5 million)at its lowest stock price on Tuesday, a far cry from the C$1.18 billion valuation when it was partially spun off from Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) in November 2012. Sears Canada, much like Sears Holdings - now its fourth-largest shareholder - has struggled for years to remain relevant to shoppers who have switched to stores that keep up with fast-changing fashion trends. The company has also booked losses as Wal-Mart Canada and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) have stepped up competition. Sears Canada's sales have fallen every quarter since it was spun off from Sears Holdings in 2012. Sears Holdings, in March, also warned about its ability to continue as a going concern. The company said on Tuesday that it would cut 400 full-time jobs at its headquarters in Illinois as part of its plan to save more than $1 billion in costs annually. Sears Canada said it would postpone its 2017 annual meeting scheduled for June 14 to a date it would determine later. The company's cash and estimated cash flows from operations were not expected to be enough to meet obligations over the next 12 months, it said in a statement. The company said it had expected to be able to borrow up to an additional $175 million, which was secured against its owned and leased real estate, as part an existing loan. Based on current talks with lenders, however, it expects that it will be able to borrow up to $109 million. Sears Canada said it had recently begun a process to address its liquidity situation to continue to finance its business and had hired BMO Capital Markets to assist with the restructuring process.

May needs the support of the DUP, one of Europe's most socially conservative parties, after failing to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election.  The DUP has fought to maintain tight restrictions on abortions and opposes gay marriage.  We are writing to seek a categorical assurance from you that you will not allow women's rights, and in particular, women's access to abortion to be used in any kind of trade-off with the DUP,  a letter to May signed by the heads of almost 30 organizations said. Abortions are only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental and physical health. As a result, hundreds of women in Northern Ireland are forced to travel to other parts of the U.K. to access abortion services but they are not entitled to a termination paid for by the National Health Service, the letter said. Extending abortion rights to Northern Irish women is a matter of fundamental human rights, said the campaigners, which included Ann Furedi, chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory service, Cathy Warwick, head of the Royal College Of Midwives and Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trade Union Congress.  Instead of contemplating any compromise the U.K. government should be focusing on extending access to abortion for women in Northern Ireland to give them the same rights as others in the U.K.,  the letter said. Britain's Brexit minister David Davis said on Monday the Conservatives would not adopt the views of its intended partner on matters such as abortion and gay marriage. Separately, the End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW)urged May to ensure election pledges aimed at improving support and justice when women are abused are followed through.  We expect to see women's human rights defended and protected no matter what 'deals' are struck in the coming days and months, and as Brexit is negotiated,  Rachel Krys, co-director of EVAW, said in a statement.  During the election campaign, the Conservative manifesto made prominent commitments on new domestic violence legislation and promised a new watchdog to improve support for victims. Levels of violence against women and girls in Britain is  extremely high  and includes one million domestic violence incidents a year and an estimated 85,000 rapes, EVAW said.

The FSA will  fairly quickly  check whether banks have set up the more in-depth risk assessments of customers, products, services, transactions and geographical areas that the new law orders them to, deputy Director General Thomas Brenoe said. Banks operating in Denmark, including market leader Danske Bank and Stockholm-based Nordea, have boosted staff levels at anti-money-laundering (AML) units in preparation for the legislation.  Normally when we've done inspections we've looked at the banks' AML efforts from A to Z, but we just might do it differently this time around and start by checking their risk assessments,  Brenoe said in a telephone interview. The FSA will most thoroughly examine whether each bank has factored in the risks that apply specifically to it, Brenoe said.  Worst case would be if a compliance lawyer has just written down some sort of standard risk assessment, altogether detached from the business, just to comply with the law,  he added. Danske Bank said it focused extensively on combating money laundering but added it could not yet comment in-depth on its efforts.  The whole AML-field has great focus in Danske Bank and we're continuously adapting the number of employees to the area as needed,  a spokesman for the bank said.  We can confirm that we in Nordea have manned up significantly within both AML and compliance over the last couple of years,  a spokesman for that bank said, declining to elaborate. The Danish government aims to raise the maximum penalty for money laundering to eight years in prison from six years currently, Justice Minister Soren Pape Poulsen told lawmakers on in April.

Sears Canada's shares slumped as much as 56 percent to 50 Canadian cents in early trading, as investors fretted about whether the company would be able to weather this liquidity crisis before it found a buyer. The company was valued at about C$51 million ($38.5 million)at its lowest stock price on Tuesday, a far cry from the C$1.18 billion valuation when it was partially spun off from Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) in November 2012. Sears Canada, much like Sears Holdings - now its fourth-largest shareholder - has struggled for years to remain relevant to shoppers who have switched to stores that keep up with fast-changing fashion trends. The company has also booked losses as Wal-Mart Canada and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) have stepped up competition. Sears Canada's sales have fallen every quarter since it was spun off from Sears Holdings in 2012. Sears Holdings, in March, also warned about its ability to continue as a going concern. The company said on Tuesday that it would cut 400 full-time jobs at its headquarters in Illinois as part of its plan to save more than $1 billion in costs annually. Sears Canada said it would postpone its 2017 annual meeting scheduled for June 14 to a date it would determine later. The company's cash and estimated cash flows from operations were not expected to be enough to meet obligations over the next 12 months, it said in a statement. The company said it had expected to be able to borrow up to an additional $175 million, which was secured against its owned and leased real estate, as part an existing loan. Based on current talks with lenders, however, it expects that it will be able to borrow up to $109 million. Sears Canada said it had recently begun a process to address its liquidity situation to continue to finance its business and had hired BMO Capital Markets to assist with the restructuring process.

Around 400 retail investors, represented by the Spanish Association of Minority Shareholders, asked Spain's Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on June 8 to investigate whether Popular's chairman Emilio Saracho and former board member Antonio del Valle misled the market and accelerated the bank's demise, a document reviewed by Reuters shows. The prosecutor's office, which acknowledged the complaint, did not say whether it will pursue the matter.  Saracho did not reply to an email seeking comment and a spokesman for Ve Por Mas, a financial group controlled by del Valle's family, said del Valle had no comment. In a separate development, Spanish consumer group OCU said on Monday it had filed a lawsuit with the High Court against Popular's previous board, in which it alleges false accounting. Banco Popular declined to comment on either action and sources told Reuters there was not yet any joint defense strategy by the former board members and lawyers had not yet been appointed. Asked about the OCU claim on Monday, Popular's former chairman Angel Ron told esRadio:  If someone brings forward charges against us accusing us of committing a crime we have never committed, we would respond with the legal tools at our disposal, with calm, knowing that the work has been done well, in accordance with the opinion of the authorities that show that the bank was solvent and that there has been a liquidity problem in recent weeks.  As part of the rescue, which involved activating Europe's strict new bank resolution regime, Santander bought Popular for 1 euro, while shareholders and junior bond investors saw their investments wiped out. Any legal action taken against Popular would become the responsibility of Santander, and could take years to resolve based on previous such cases. OCU said it had received inquiries from shareholders who subscribed to Popular's 2.5 billion euro (2.8 billion) capital increase in May 2016. The investors said they were not privy to the correct financial information, it added. OCU sent a letter to the Economy Ministry and Bank of Spain last week asking that Popular's 300,000 retail investors should have any claims heard quickly, rather than the years lawsuits such as theirs normally take to resolve. Rival Spanish lender Bankia was taken over by the government in 2012, just a year after a listing in which hundreds of thousands of small investors bought shares. It was subject to a number of court cases before eventually agreeing last year to pay them 1.5 billion euros in compensation.

Twenty parliamentarians, including former Finns Party leader Timo Soini and all other current Finns ministers, formed a new group called New Alternative. Prime Minister Juha Sipila, who had said he would break up his three-party coalition over the new Finns leaders, said he was ready to continue with the new group.  This is a very pleasing solution. We'll continue with the current ministers, and with the current government program... The situation will be closed in just one day,  Sipila told reporters. Sipila was on his way to hand over his resignation to President Sauli Niinisto when the split was announced, making a U-turn rush back. The split between hardliners and more moderate members of the nationalists was the latest in a series of blows to Europe's anti-establishment parties. On Sunday, France's National Front and Italy's 5-Star Movement failed in attempts to win legislative and civic elections, respectively. Last week, Britain's UK Independence Party saw its vote share collapse and won no seats in the British parliament. The crisis for Finland's government began on Saturday when  the Finns Party, previously the second-biggest parliamentary group, chose Jussi Halla-aho as its new leader and replaced three deputy leaders with anti-immigrant hardliners in a shift to the radical right. They will now be left out of government with 17 MPs, including two who have said they will quit. Simon Elo, chairman of the New Alternative group, said: Finnish Prime Minister Centre Party chairman Juha Sipilä and minister Sampo Terho (R) from the New Alternative attend a press conferance at the PM's official residence Kesäranta in Helsinki, Finland on June 13, 2017 where all parliament parties and their chairmen were summoned. PM Sipilä seeks new coalition as populist Finns Party split on Tuesday.   Jussi Nukari/Lehtikuva/via REUTERS This decision will likely ruin our political careers...but we are determined to do this...for the right reasons. Today we are not politicians, but we are doing this for the fatherland's sake,  said  With New Alternative, the coalition - including Sipila's Center Party and pro-EU National Coalition Party (NCP) - would have 106 of the parliament's 200 seats. Analysts had said a change in the coalition set-up could have derailed planned healthcare and local government reforms - central to Sipila's plan to balance public finances. Finland is recovering from a decade of stagnation. The government, now half-way of its four-year tenure, has sought to improve growth and curb public debt growth by cutting spending and reforming labor laws. Slideshow (7 Images)The central bank slightly increased its economic growth projections on Tuesday, but sees the pace declining from this year to 2019. Turning Finns Finland's Finns Party is transforming for the second time: It was founded in 1995 after the demise of agrarian populist party SMP, rising from obscurity with an anti-EU platform during the euro zone debt crisis, and expanding into the second-biggest parliamentary party in 2015 election. But after joining the government, its support dropped due to compromises in the coalition, increasing calls from the party grass root for tougher policy line. The newly-elected party leader Halla-aho had said he wants Finland to leave the European Union. In 2012 he was fined by Finland's Supreme Court in 2012 for comments on a blog that linked Islam to paedophilia and Somalis to theft. Speaking to reporters at the party office on his third day as party chairman, Halla-aho said he was disappointed by the split.  It is hard to believe that this sort of operation and betrayal of voters would happen... I could've not expected such a broad movement,  he said.

Moldova, a former Soviet state that has long been the focus of a struggle for influence between Russia and the West, expelled the diplomats on May 29. It did not explain the decision, with Prime Minister Pavel Filip saying only that his government had  good reasons . According to the sources, who are familiar with the case, the five were ejected because of their alleged activities as undercover officers with the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. They said Moldovan officials believed the Russians were recruiting fighters from Gagauzia, an autonomous southern region home to an ethnic Turkish population that is pro-Russian and opposes closer integration with the European Union.     The Moldovan government source and Chisinau-based diplomatic sources all spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. They did not say how the Russians allegedly recruited the fighters, how many were recruited or the reason for their recruitment. Reuters could not independently verify the allegations about the activities of the five Russians. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin described the allegations as  idle gossip , saying they were not supported by facts.  Someone is deliberately trying to whip up a wave of propaganda,  Karasin was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency.  The people (diplomats) carried out their stated official duties to the letter.    Related CoverageRussia says report its Moldova diplomats recruited fighters is 'gossip': RIAThe Russian defense ministry did not respond to requests for comment.  Asked by Reuters if the five Russians were GRU officers, a spokeswoman for the Moldovan foreign ministry said they were diplomats and declined to comment further. More than 10,000 people have died in fighting in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian rebels since the conflict began in 2014 following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula. While Moscow politically backs the insurgents, it has repeatedly denied Western accusations that it is arming them and sending fighters to aid them.  Training Camp Moldovan intelligence believes fighters recruited from Gagauzia were first sent to a paramilitary training camp in the Rostov region of southern Russia, according to the sources.  The sources did not identify the camp. Russia has used at least two military camps in Rostov to train volunteers for fighting in eastern Ukraine, according to evidence collected by Reuters and the Russian media.    A former member of a Russian army artillery unit told Reuters that he saw about 200 people in camouflage fatigues - not Russian military uniforms - based in a camp near a Russian army position at the Kuzminsky firing range in Rostov in 2014, at the time of fierce battles in eastern Ukraine.  This was corroborated by a member of a unit of the Cossacks - a Russian paramilitary group - who told Reuters in early 2015 that volunteers to fight in Ukraine were training alongside the Russian army in that area.  According to Russian media outlet Gazeta.ru, fighters bound for eastern Ukraine were also training at the Kadamovsky firing range in Rostov. The three sources said some information about Gagauzians fighting in eastern Ukraine was brought to the attention of Moldovan authorities by Ukraine's state security service, the SBU, which gathers intelligence on people fighting with the separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine.  With information from the SBU, the Moldovan authorities were able to track, arrest and interrogate Gagauzian fighters returning from the conflict, according to the sources. Some became informers, they added.   In response to a series of questions from Reuters, including whether it passed intelligence to Moldova about fighters in east Ukraine or knew why the Russian diplomats were expelled, the SBU said:  The Security Service of Ukraine does not have the information you requested.  Relations between Moldova and Russia have been bumpy under a succession of pro-Western governments. Russia halted imports of Moldovan produce in retaliation for Chisinau signing a trade and political deal with the European Union in 2014. Moldova and Russia have also feuded over the treatment of Moldovan officials traveling to Russia. But Russia has forged direct ties to Gagauzia.  Irina Vlah, elected the head of Gagauzia in March 2015 on pledges of closer ties with Russia, visited the Kremlin in January this year and attended a reception hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The people of Gagauzia view Russia with affection,  Vlah said at the reception.

In the end, May's Tory party failed to win a majority in parliament, prompting calls for her plan to leave the EU's single market to be watered down and leading some rival lawmakers to demand the Brexit process be delayed. Droves of newly registered young voters - many of whom voted to stay in the EU - backed the opposition Labour Party, scuppering May's hopes of a walkover win. Around two-thirds of the economists polled this week, 33 out of 49, said the chance of a hard Brexit had receded somewhat. Three said it had receded significantly, while eight said there was no change. Five said it had increased somewhat and none said increased significantly.  The prime minister may have to change her stance and approach to Brexit following the election outcome,  said Nikesh Sawjani at Lloyds Banking Group. May has two years to reach agreement with the European Union but has repeatedly said she would be prepared to walk away from negotiations without a deal if necessary. But she now might find that more difficult to do.  The reduced majority of the Conservatives means that the mandate for a hard Brexit just isn't there anymore,  said George Brown at the CBI.  FILE PHOTO: An EU flag flies above Parliament Square during a Unite for Europe march, in London, Britain March 25, 2017.Peter Nicholls/File PhotoConcern over immigration from other EU member states was a major reason behind the vote to leave, and May has said she will respect those fears by halting freedom of movement.  That would almost certainly mean no free access for British companies to the EU's huge single market, likely damaging what already threatens to be weak economic growth. [ECILT/GB] Almost half of British employers are unprepared for the government's planned changes to immigration rules after Brexit, a survey from the Resolution Foundation think tank showed on Monday. Another survey found British business confidence has fallen sharply since the election, while figures showed consumers cut their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month as households turned more cautious. Having fallen as much as 23 percent after the referendum nearly a year ago, touching a 31-year low below $1.15, in October, sterling GBP= is currently trading around $1.266. On Friday, the pound sank to a two-month low and 26 of 50 respondents said it was likely to fall more in the next few months. Fifteen said there would be no change and nine predicted sterling would recoup some of its losses.  With markets unduly optimistic about the prospect of a Tory-led coalition, sterling is vulnerable to a further sell-off,  said Joanna Davies at Fathom. Medians in a Reuters poll of 60 specialists, taken before the election, predicted the pound will be at $1.28 in one month, $1.27 in six and then at $1.28 in a year.

The prosecutor's office said the Real Madrid forward had knowingly used a business structure created in 2010 to allegedly hide his image rights income in Spain between 2011 and 2014. This involved a  voluntary  failure to comply with his tax obligations in Spain, the statement from the office's economic crimes section said. The four counts of tax fraud were based on a report from Spain's tax agency, it said in a statement. Ronaldo denied the accusations through his representatives late on Tuesday.  There is no tax evasion scheme ... There has never been any hiding nor any intention to hide anything,  Gestifute, the agency representing the player, said in a statement. Gestifute said it would publish documents to show the Portuguese player had not created such a structure and had instead used firms he had owned since his time at Manchester United that both British and Spanish tax authorities had been aware of. The agency also said the case could relate to different interpretations between the British and Spanish tax systems over where to declare some revenues but would in any case not constitute fraud. Ronaldo, who led Real Madrid to their 12th European Cup earlier this month, is the latest in a long line of soccer players in Spain - among them Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Neymar - to be caught up in cases over tax or transfers. Between 2005 and 2010, foreign players in Spain were protected under the so-called  Beckham law  allowing them to curb their taxes. But as the financial crisis bit deeper, that exemption was lifted, paving the way for the cases.     Football Soccer - Latvia vs Portugal - 2018 World Cup Qualifying European Zone - Group B - Skonto Stadium, Riga, Latvia - June 9, 2017   Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo gestures   Reuters / Kacper PempelThe prosecutor's office alleges that Ronaldo had defrauded the tax authorities of 1.4 million euros in 2011, 1.7 million euros in 2012, 3.2 million euros in 2013 and 8.5 million euros in 2014. Image Rights The prosecutor said that after Ronaldo signed a contract to join Real Madrid in December 2008 he ceded his image rights to a company called Tollin Associates Ltd, domiciled in the British Virgin Islands and in which he was the only stakeholder. Tollin Associates then ceded his image rights to a company in Ireland called Multisports&Image; Management Ltd which was responsible for managing them. Tollin Associates itself had no business activity, the statement said.  Ceding image rights to (Tollin Associates) was completely unnecessary and its only purpose was to create a screen to conceal the totality of his image rights income from the Spanish tax authorities,  the statement said. The prosecutor's office filed the lawsuit against Ronaldo on Tuesday to a court in the Madrid district of Pozuelo de Alarcon. Ronaldo finished the soccer season scoring two goals in a 4-1 victory over Juventus in the Champions League final to become the tournament's top scorer with a total of 12 goals.  In May, Spain's Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Messi and stood by a Catalan regional court's 21-month prison sentence for defrauding authorities of 4.1 million euros on image rights. He is unlikely to go to prison as under Spanish law sentences under two years can be served under probation. Spain's High Court last month cleared Neymar of fraud but he still faces a corruption trial in Spain in connection with the value of his 2013 transfer from Santos to Barcelona. He has denied wrongdoing. ($1 = 0.8921 euros) Writing by Julien Toyer; Editing by Alison Williams and Gareth Jones","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-taxation-ronaldo-idUSKBN19417Q"},

The price of Dana's sukuk plunged after Dana's proposal on Tuesday, with one creditor in Dubai describing it as  very investor unfriendly  and another saying it made no sense as the bond had been judged sharia-compliant when it was issued. Dana's 9 percent bonds were offered at 87 cents on the dollar, down from 91-92 cents previously, while shares in the company closed 15 percent higher. The Dubai-based portfolio manager said Dana would have trouble tapping the debt market again if it unilaterally declared its paper illegal and said he had already contacted the company's investor relations office to express his strong disapproval of the proposal. Dana, which had a cash balance of $298 million in March, originally announced its intention to hold discussions with sukuk holders in early May. Dana said at that time it needed to focus on “medium-term cash preservation” because of difficulty getting payments from production assets in Egypt and Iraq. The existing sukuk, half of which are exchangeable into equity, will mature this October. But on Tuesday, Dana said it had received legal advice that the paper was not sharia-compliant and was therefore unlawful in the United Arab Emirates. As a result, Dana said, it was proposing to creditors that they swap it for new sharia-compliant instruments with four-year maturities and profit distributions at less than half the rate of the existing instruments. The new paper would not feature any conversion into equity. New York-listed Houlihan Lokey is advising Dana Gas on the matter, while a committee of sukuk holders has appointed New York-based boutique investment bank Moelis as adviser for the restructuring negotiations. Dana said it was seeking a consensual agreement with investors but had started proceedings in UAE courts to seek a declaration on the lawfulness of its existing sukuk. The sukuk use the mudaraba format, a common Islamic finance structure which resembles an investment management partnership. Dana said it had discovered they were illegal because of  the evolution and continual development of Islamic financial instruments and their interpretation . A source with direct knowledge of the situation said the firm planned to argue the sukuk were not sharia-compliant because their repurchase price was fixed, the coupon was the result of interest-based not profit-based calculations, and the coupon paid out regardless of Dana's financial performance. Islamic finance stresses risk-sharing, which some scholars take to mean investors in sukuk should not be able to count on fixed coupon payments. Dana said profit payments from its proposed new instruments would comprise cash and payment-in-kind (PIK) elements.  The PIK element is absurd - there's no reason why the company would not pay in cash, especially in the light of the fact they're now receiving some payments from Egypt,  the first creditor, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. Dana also said it was proposing pre-payments for the new sukuk at par prior to its maturity, providing a path for early pay-down for the holders. It did not give details.

The Short-Term IDR has been affirmed at 'F1+'. The trust certificates issued by IDB Trust Services Ltd and guaranteed by IsDB have also been affirmed at 'AAA'. The ratings reflect the intrinsic strengths of IsDB; in particular its 'excellent' capitalisation, low solvency risks and 'excellent' liquidity compared with other regional multilateral development banks (MDBs). It is important to note that the IsDB has changed its financial year end from Lunar Hijri to Solar Hijri (equivalent to Gregorian calendar) and so the end-2016 financial statements used in this rating assessment are based on a 15-month financial year. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings are underpinned by the intrinsic strengths of IsDB; most notably its 'excellent' levels of capitalisation. At 46.2% (end-2016), IsDB's equity-to-assets ratio is far above the 25% 'excellent' threshold as outlined in our supranational rating criteria and is one of the strongest in the universe of MDBs. Capitalisation has eroded in recent years (vs. 70.7% at end-October 2010) and leverage has risen (114.2% end-2016 vs. 37.2% at end-October 2010), in line with the bank's steady growth in financing operations. The bank further loosened its leverage policy last year, increasing the internal limit for debt/equity ratio to 125% from 100%. In Fitch's view, leverage will continue to increase in coming years, but will remain below 'AAA'-rated peers' levels. In terms of risks, Fitch assesses IsDB overall as 'low risk'. Overall loan performance has been strong, with the bank's non-performing loan (NPL) ratio at just 2.8% at end-2016, despite exposure to countries going through deep political troubles. However, the bank has large exposures to sovereigns in poorly rated countries, which translate into an average rating of loans of 'B+'. The bank's risk concentration is assessed at 'low risk', with the five-largest exposures accounting for 31% of total banking exposure. Equity risk is 'low' with equity participations accounting for 12% of total banking exposure, which Fitch views as a manageable risk for IsDB as it remains contained activity and is expected to continue to decline in the coming years. The bank's risk management is conservative overall, and as such is assessed as 'strong' with many prudential rules in place, including limiting exposure to a single country, a single sector and a single investee as a proportion of the portfolio. However, the provisioning of impaired assets is less conservative than other 'AAA' rated MDBs. Liquidity is overall assessed at 'aaa', as liquidity buffers are 'excellent' and are in line with 'AAA' rated peers. The quality of the bank's treasury assets, however, remains a weakness, as just 12% of treasury assets are rated 'AA-' or above, a ratio that is considerably below 'AAA' peers'. This risk is mitigated though by the high share of the treasury asset portfolio that is rated investment grade, as well as IsDB's excellent access to capital markets. IsDB's overall business environment is assessed as 'medium risk', comprising both the bank's business profile and operating environment risks. The bank's size of the non-sovereign sector (19.9% of total banking exposure), size of banking portfolio (USD18.6 billion) and strategy are all assessed as 'medium risk', in line with Fitch's supranational criteria. The bank's quality of governance, however, is assessed as 'low risk' to reflect the bank's experienced staff and prudential risk framework, which Fitch expects the bank to maintain over the coming years. The credit quality of IsDB's countries of operations is assessed as 'high risk' owing to the bank's continued lending to a number of sub-investment grade countries, with just two of the bank's top 10 largest exposures being rated investment grade by Fitch. Our assessment for income per capita in countries of operations is now based on World Bank Income Group classification, which shows that over half of IsDB's countries of operations are ranked as either 'low income' or 'lower middle' income' and therefore scores a 'high risk' in our assessment. The political risk and business climate in the bank's countries of operations is assessed using the World Bank Governance Indicators and, for IsDB, is 'high risk'. Overall, IsDB's business environment is assessed as 'medium risk', with no uplift made to our solvency assessment. Capacity to support is not as strong as some other regional MDBs; the average rating of key shareholders, consisting of Saudi Arabia (A+/Stable), Libya, Iran, Nigeria (B+/Negative) and UAE, is 'BB+' and there remains no callable capital by countries rated 'AAA'/'AA+'. Shareholders have consistently demonstrated their propensity to support the bank through regular inflows of fresh capital and, despite the moderate size of the bank's balance sheet, IsDB is an important tool to channel sharia-compliant financing to member states. RATING SENSITIVITIES Pressure on the ratings would arise from a pronounced weakening of asset quality or unexpected deterioration of capitalisation and leverage. Deterioration in the quality of IsDB's treasury asset portfolio could lead to pressure on the bank's intrinsic rating and, in turn, IDR. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes that the member countries will participate in the ongoing capital increase and that lending growth will remain moderate over the coming years.

As the president and CEO of Cohen Brothers Realty, the corporation started by his father and uncles, the 65-year-old billionaire has been involved in the construction and management of countless Manhattan addresses, from Grand Central Plaza at 622 Third Avenue to International Plaza at 750 Lexington. But Cohen's not-so-secret passion is the film business: Producing movies, collecting them and even screening them at Manhattan's Quad Cinema. For the latest in Reuters'  Life Lessons  series, he spoke about how to thrive in even the toughest business environments. Q: Since your father was the one who started your real estate business, was he your greatest influence? A: For my whole life. He was a self-made man: He began his career in men's clothing, and then became an Oldsmobile dealer after WW2, and then started in real estate. Whatever I learned from him was by observation and osmosis. He was very no-nonsense, and I notice that in my own personality quite a bit, too. He didn't sugar-coat anything. Q: Did you work for him when you were growing up? A: When I was 14 I used to work summers in his real estate office. I would type up lease renewals, and on weekends show apartments as well. It was a good way to discover my own voice in dealing with people. I was mature for my age, and I guess I was pretty good at it. Q: New York City real estate is a tough business. Do you have to be equally tough to survive? A: Construction is a tough business, for sure. There are tough characters, and people looking to take advantage of you every step of the way. You get experienced by surviving those situations and making the best of them. Does it make you a little hard? Well, if you are not tough, you'll be run over in the street with tire marks across your back. Q: What drew you to invest in film? A: Being a producer is very much like being a developer. In the real estate world you receive rent, just like you receive fees and royalties for intellectual property. Entertainment is a tough business, too, but very rewarding when you accomplish something meaningful. I have stayed independent, and I only do projects that resonate with me. Q: What principles have guided your philanthropic spending? A: It is based on personal feelings, and wanting to make a difference. So I'm involved with everything from the Museum of Arts and Design, to the Alliance Francaise, to the Temple of Emanu-El in Manhattan, which is the largest Jewish congregation in the world. It's not just about writing a check, though. I want to make a meaningful contribution. Q: Are you planning for your kids to get involved in the business at some point? A: I always encourage my kids to do what it is that they want to do. So right now, nobody works with me. It's important that they find what they really love, and then get very good at it. That process will take about 20 years, that is what I have found. Q: Did you set up trusts for them? A: Interestingly I had no trust growing up, and my father never gave me any money, either early on or later. But yes, I do have trusts for my children, which I control and invest for them. It is important that they be provided for. Q: What do you tell them about success? A: The only way to learn any business is to do absolutely everything, from the ground up. So I started out doing leases, and then got into different areas like management, finance, zoning, cleaning, acquisitions. Hopefully, you will get to the top over time. But you have to understand the business first. Editing by Beth Pinsker","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-money-lifelessons-cohen-idUSKBN1931KN"},

Traders have priced in a 94 percent chance of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. Investors are also looking for more details on the central bank's plans to trim its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The Fed is expected to release its decision at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) on Wednesday followed by a press conference by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. A bout of profit-taking in richly-valued technology stocks caused the Nasdaq to suffer its worst two-day drop in more than six months on Monday. However, technology stocks staged a recovery on Tuesday. Apple, which had sparked the selloff, was up 1.3 percent at $147.29 and boosted the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq. Big technology names like Microsoft, Alphabet and Facebook were also up about 1 percent, propping up the S&P; technology sector.

During treatment, relaxation practices had the strongest fatigue-reducing effect, but after cancer treatments are complete, yoga provided the biggest benefit.  “During and after cancer therapy, fatigue is one of the most frequent and distressing symptoms,” said lead author Roger Hilfiker of the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland Valais in Leukerbad. Cancer-related fatigue is considered a “distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning,” the authors write in British Journal of Sports Medicine. Depending on the types of cancer patients have and the treatments they receive, more than a quarter experience this kind of severe fatigue, and it can last for five years or more after treatment, the study team writes.  “Although there is a huge amount of scientific literature on this topic, it remains one of the symptoms for which cancer patients express high unmet supportive care needs,” Hilfiker told Reuters Health by email. “It seems the available research is not yet fully implemented in clinical practice.” The researchers reviewed 245 studies published between 1989 and 2017 that evaluated non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce cancer-related fatigue during chemotherapy and radiotherapy or afterward. More than half of the studies involved women with breast cancer. The analysis focused on conventional physiotherapy-related interventions such as movement therapy, relaxation, massage, yoga and Tai Chi and excluded trials that investigated nutritional supplements, acupuncture, acupressure, Reiki healing and expressive writing.  Hilfiker and colleagues found that during cancer treatment, relaxation exercises such as meditation and stretching were the most effective, followed by massage, combined exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy, and combined aerobic and resistance training. Healing touch, dance, music, Tai-Chi, and cognitive-behavioral therapy alone landed at the bottom of the list.  After cancer treatment, yoga was the most effective, followed by breathing exercises, combined aerobic and resistance training, dance and combined exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy. At the bottom of the list, massage, relaxation, resistance exercise alone, aerobic exercise alone and cognitive-behavioral therapy alone were less effective.  “Relaxation seems to be an important part during cancer treatment,” Hilfiker said. “This might be very important for patients who are not motivated or not able to engage in more demanding physical activities.” The next step is to look at the intensity, frequency and volume of exercise to understand what to recommend to patients, said Leorey Saligan, a principal investigator in the Symptom Management Branch of the National Institute of Nursing Research in Bethesda, Maryland. “There’s been a big shift in the paradigm, especially in oncology research, in looking at treatments for patients,” Saligan, who wasn’t involved with this study, told Reuters Health. “This information can empower patients because they know they have options.” Saligan is researching cancer-related fatigue and interventions from a biological perspective, aiming to understand what happens in the body to reduce the fatigue. If specific types of patients respond to specific types of therapies, doctors may be able to better recommend options to their patients. “If we can predict which patients are at risk for fatigue based on their biological makeup, we can plan their interventions way ahead of time,” Saligan said. “We can now tell patients to go out and exercise, and next we want to be able to tell them how long, how often and how fast.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2r0diiZ British Journal of Sports Medicine, online May 13, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-fatigue-idUSKBN18M1ZM"},

The quotas would come on top of stricter fuel economy requirements that are set to gradually become among the world's toughest by 2020.

Australian wheat production is expected to total 24.19 million tonnes, the Australian Bureau of Agriculture, Resource Economics and Rural Sciences (ABARES) said, up nearly 1 percent from its March forecast of 23.98 million tonnes. The uptick could provide a headwind for benchmark global prices, which hit a one-month high last week on concerns about potential production losses to U.S. spring wheat production. Still, Australian production is returning to average levels after output soared to a record 35.13 million tonnes last season, led by bumper production from Western Australian following near perfect conditions. Much of the increase in the 2017/18 forecast will come from the country's east coast, the bureau said, after heavy downpours between March and June aided soil moisture, boosting the prospects of fledging crops. Strong east coast production is a potential boon for GrainCorp Ltd, Australia's largest listed bulk grain handler, amid a rush for high protein supplies. Global prices for higher protein wheat have risen in the wake of recent adverse weather that has affected production of U.S. spring wheat. Australia's east coast, where GrainCorp enjoys a dominant market position, is the country's only high-protein producer. Unlike last season, heavy rains this year have arrived in a timely manner. East coast production soared last season but late rains led to a quality downgrade, reducing the exportable surplus of high quality crops. The brighter outlook for east coast production is in contrast to conditions on the west coast, Australia's largest grain producing region. Production from Western Australia is expected to total 8.5 million tonnes during the 2017/18 season, down 15 percent from last year and behind a five-year average. The bureau said 2017/18 canola production will total 3.32 million tonnes, down from its March forecast of 3.69 million tonnes.

Air Berlin, in which Gulf carrier Etihad Airways has an almost 30 percent stake, said last week it had asked Berlin and North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW) to consider loan guarantees. The German federal government said on Friday any support would be contingent on the airline showing it had a sustainable business model.

Otherwise, a request for a state loan guarantee wouldn't have been made.

Qatar's index fell by 0.4 percent but remained more stable than when the sanctions were announced last week. Qatar National Bank, the region's largest lender, fell by 1.3 percent. Like other Qatari banks, it has been hit by concern that the economic and diplomatic boycott imposed by Saudi Arabia and its allies could reduce its access to foreign funding. However, some other lenders held firm, with Doha Bank up 0.2 percent. Logistics company Gulf Warehousing, which had plunged after the boycott started, rebounded 6.9 percent to 48.80 riyals. Though Qatar's trade has been disrupted, it has kept shipments moving thanks to measures such as changing shipping routes to operate via Oman instead of the United Arab Emirates. Dubai's index rose 0.4 percent as Emaar Properties rose 1 percent, building on gains after last week's announcement of plans to spin off its local real estate business. In Abu Dhabi, the index climbed 0.6 percent as Dana Gas jumped by its 15 percent daily limit to 0.69 dirhams, its highest level since late 2014. Trade in the stock was at its heaviest for three years. The company said it was proposing to restructure its $700 million of outstanding sukuk at much lower profit rates because it had discovered the paper was  unlawful  in the United Arab Emirates -- a claim that some creditors said they would contest.

At 9:32 a.m. ET (1332 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3228 to the greenback, or 75.60 U.S. cents, up 0.7 percent.     The currency's weakest level was C$1.3325, while it touched its strongest since April 13 at C$1.3226.     Gains for the loonie came even as prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, edged down after OPEC reported an increase in its production for May.                  U.S. crude        prices were down 0.22 percent at $45.98 a barrel.     The U.S. dollar        inched down as traders eyed the start of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting.                  Canadian government bond prices were much lower across the yield curve, with the two-year            down 12.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.911 percent and the 10-year             falling 58 Canadian cents to yield 1.549 percent.     The 2-year yield touched its highest intraday since January 2015 at 0.914 percent.

Based on other bond market indicators, they estimated the probability of a U.S. recession from now to June 2018 at less than 10 percent. This compared with the yield curve, or the gap between long-dated and short-dated yields, which currently implies roughly a 33 percent chance of a recession.  Despite this development, we do not see U.S. recession risk as particularly elevated; indeed, we think it is quite low for the next year,  Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a research note. Historically, a sharp flattening of the yield curve has preceded a recession as traders pile into longer-dated Treasuries in anticipation of an economic contraction. On Monday, the two-year to 10-year portion of the Treasury yield curve flattened to 83.80 basis points, its tightest since early October. It reached nearly 137 basis points in December, which was its steepest level in a year, Tradeweb data showed. Analysts and traders have attributed the curve flattening  to doubts about any forthcoming fiscal stimulus from Washington and recent economic data that fell short of expectations.   Still, some aspects of the U.S. economy such as the labor market and housing continue to perform well without signs they will overheat in the next 12 months, Deutsche Bank economists said. However, a further tightening of the labor market in the next 18 months might force the Federal Reserve to accelerate its pace of rate increases, raising the chances of a recession by 2020, according to the bank's economists.  The more hawkish scenario would clearly move the Fed's policy stance to a level that would make a recession likely by late-2019 or 2020,  they wrote. The Fed's policy setting committee holds a scheduled meeting later this week, at which it is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate to a target range of 1.00 to 1.25 percent.

Fitch has also affirmed Sanlam Life's parent and the ultimate holding company of the Sanlam group, Sanlam Limited's (Sanlam) National Long-Term rating at 'AA+(zaf)'. The Outlooks are Stable. The affirmations reflect the Sanlam group's resilient business position, capitalisation and operating performance relative to peers. Fitch also views favourably the diversification provided by Sanlam Emerging Markets (SEM), which contributed 20% to Sanlam's operating profit in 2016. The group's earnings and investment exposure to a weakening South African economy is a rating weakness. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS Sanlam's well-established and diversified business position in South Africa is a key rating strength. Sanlam sells a wide range of investment, insurance and other personal finance products to individuals and institutional clients. Investment-type business is the main component (2016 and 2015: 64%) of total funds received, and is mainly derived from South Africa. Santam, the group's majority owned non-life subsidiary, is the largest general insurer in South Africa, with a strong domestic franchise and a market share of around 20%. It writes all classes of business and has a well-known brand in both commercial and personal lines. Capital is conservatively managed, with Sanlam Life's statutory capital adequacy requirement (CAR) cover ratio remaining strong and unchanged at 5.8x at end-2016, the highest level in its peer group. The group's capital position is supportive of the group's ratings with a Prism factor-based capital model (FBM) score of  extremely strong  at end-2016. Sanlam has continued using excess capital to invest in high-growth business opportunities both within and outside South Africa. In May Sanlam redeployed discretionary capital (i.e. capital in excess of the company's internally assessed capital requirements) of USD329 million toward a further 16.6% stake in Saham Finances S.A. (Saham), taking its total investment in Saham to USD704 million (around ZAR9 billion at current exchange rates) for a 46.6% stake. Fitch views favourably the diversification benefits of Saham's holding; however, it is not clear if the transaction will prove earnings-accretive to the group. In January 2017 the group also announced its acquisition of a 53% stake of South African life insurer BrightRock for around ZAR700 million. Sanlam's financial leverage of 8% at end-2016 (end-2015: 6%) is well within Fitch's guidelines for the ratings. The rise was mainly driven by a rise in Santam's standalone financial leverage to 22% at end-2016 (end-2015: 10%) following a subordinated notes issue of ZAR1 billion in April 2016. Sanlam has indicated that it intends to raise up to the equivalent of USD140 million in debt related to the Saham acquisition. As a result Fitch expects Sanlam's financial leverage to rise by up to four percentage points, but to remain within the limits for the ratings. Earnings generation is strong, diversified and compares favourably with that of its leading peers. The group's 2016 net operating profit improved 10% yoy, of which 7% represented organic growth and the balance a result of first-time contributions from previous acquisitions. This was supported by a 30% rise for SEM, supported by like-for-like growth of 45% in the 'rest of Africa segment', which excludes Namibia and Botswana. Fitch expects the aggregate operating profit contribution from SEM to rise, driven by the strong organic growth potential of the various underlying markets. The group's normalised headline earnings for 2016 decreased 6% following a 65% decline in net investment returns earned on Sanlam's capital portfolio. This portfolio is exposed to equity market and currency volatility. Santam has a long history of underwriting profitability, and in 2016 reported a strong combined ratio of 94%, in line with the 10-year average combined ratio of 94%, albeit weaker than 2015 (90%). The weaker result was mainly due to more catastrophe claims and higher motor repair cost.  We expect recent storms and wild fires in the Western Cape to only weaken Santam's 2017 combined ratio marginally, owing to the significant reinsurance protection that it has in place. Fitch views favourably Santam's consistently strong operating performance and profitability track record. Most South African-based life insurers have reported weakening net customer cash flows, reflecting a difficult local economic environment. In addition, the sector remains exposed to domestic credit and other investment risks through exposure to local financial markets. However, these risk factors do not adversely affect the life insurance sector's creditworthiness relative to that of the South African sovereign. Sanlam Life, SDM and Santam are assessed as  core  to the Sanlam group under Fitch's insurance group rating methodology. Sanlam Life and SDM are fully integrated within the Sanlam group. Santam shares the group's strategy, including providing essential support to the group's emerging markets expansion. RATING SENSITIVITIES A substantial and sustained deterioration in capitalisation (in terms of Fitch's Prism score or Sanlam Life's CAR cover ratio), a weak operating performance or a severe weakening of market share could lead to a downgrade. A downgrade of Santam's ratings could be triggered by deterioration in Santam's standalone profile to an extent that Fitch no longer considers Santam as core to Sanlam. This could result from a sustained weak operating performance and/or severe weakening in Santam's market share.

The Pacific saw a relatively rapid swing in late October from La Nina conditions - characterized as unusually cold temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean - to neutral or even slightly El Nino-leaning conditions by March. Since then, however, the oceanic and atmospheric signals pointing to a possible El Nino have all weakened.  The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) last week downgraded the probability of El Nino conditions being present in the fourth quarter of 2017, to just 36 percent. That is down from 53 percent at the time of its March forecast. (tmsnrt.rs/2snJmB0) The agency’s central prediction is now that conditions will be neutral in the fourth quarter, with a probability of 53 percent, with only an outlying chance of La Nina, at 11 percent. Sea Temperatures El Nino has a major impact on temperatures and precipitation on countries bordering the Pacific and Indian oceans, and across Latin America, with a smaller impact in some areas of the United States. The phenomenon is typically strongest during the northern hemisphere autumn and winter and weakest during early spring. In winter, El Nino typically brings warmer weather to the U.S. Northwest and cooler, wetter weather to the Southwest and Southeast states. For the purposes of forecasting, meteorologists analyze the surface temperature of the Pacific in a series of boxes stretching from the coast of Peru west along the equator to the international date line and beyond. (tmsnrt.rs/2sXiR2v) The atmospheric and oceanic conditions identified with El Nino and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are most closely associated with temperatures in a composite area called Nino region 3.4. Region 3.4 straddles the equator from 5 degrees north to 5 degrees south and stretches from 120 degrees west to 170 degrees west. (“Why are there so many ENSO indexes, instead of just one?” NOAA, Jan 2015) El Nino is conventionally defined as at least three or sometimes six consecutive months in which the surface temperature in region 3.4 averages 0.5 degrees or more above normal. Surface temperatures in region 3.4 have been rising steadily since October, and are now 0.4 degrees Celsius above the long-term seasonal average, but there are indications they may be peaking. (tmsnrt.rs/2so2JK6) Temperatures further east off the coast of Peru in Nino region 1+2, which stretches from 80 degrees to 90 degrees west, and from the equator to 10 degrees south, have cooled rapidly in the last three months. Surface temperatures in region 1+2 are now 0.1 degrees Celsius below the long-term average, down from 2.6 degrees above the average in mid-March. (tmsnrt.rs/2snQjBZ) Surface temperatures in region 1+2 are usually a good leading indicator for the warmth of water further out in the ocean in region 3.4 given the westward flow of water on the southern equatorial current. (tmsnrt.rs/2rVSdZd) The rapid cooling of water in region 1+2 indicates temperatures in region 3.4 are likely to cool further in the next few weeks, which makes it much less likely a full El Nino episode will develop in the months ahead. Neutral Conditions Other components of ENSO also point to relatively neutral conditions in the near term and mean El Nino will probably not develop before the end of the year. El Nino conditions are normally propagated by an upwelling of warmer than average water from deep down in the ocean off the coast of Peru. But there are currently no signs of warm upwelling. Sub-surface waters off the coast of Peru at depths ranging from about 50 meters to 150 meters are close to the long-term average. The Southern Oscillation, which is the atmospheric counterpart of the El Nino-La Nina cycle, is characterized by variations in atmospheric pressure differentials and wind speeds across the Pacific. El Nino is usually accompanied by a reduction in pressure differentials between the western and eastern sides of the Pacific and a consequent slackening of the trade winds. But both sea-level pressure differences and wind speeds remain close to their long-term averages, according to the latest data. (tmsnrt.rs/2rW82PL and tmsnrt.rs/2snEps1) The conditions for a mutually reinforcing warming of the ocean surface and slackening of the trade winds that characterize a warm episode of ENSO are currently absent.

UK law firm Harcus Sinclair and Dutch Foundation  Stichting Volkswagen Car Claim , a U.S.-style class action on behalf of an estimated 180,000 Dutch VW car owners, have teamed up in a move that could spark a wave of coordinated litigation across Europe. VW, Europe's biggest carmaker, has said about 11 million cars worldwide were fitted with software to cheat diesel emissions tests that are designed to limit car fumes blamed for respiratory diseases and global pollution.  The company has already agreed to spend up to $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and has offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. But it has not reached a similar deal in Europe and faces billions of euros in claims from customers and investors. The carmaker has offered European drivers a software update for all affected vehicles, but lawyers say this does not resolve the problem and they are demanding adequate compensation.  The Dutch Foundation, which says it has been trying to reach a  reasonable settlement  with VW since 2015, said it was also   cooperating  with partners representing drivers in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and was in talks with others in Spain, France, Italy, Poland, the Czech Republic and Scandinavia.   We are delighted to be teaming up with Harcus Sinclair UK Limited, who have done an excellent job in paving the way for car owners to seek redress from VW through the courts,  said Guido van Woerkom, director of the foundation. The expanding lawsuit is seeking compensation for damage suffered by VW, Audi, SEAT, Skoda and/or Porsche car owners, alleging VW and supplier Bosch were responsible for the sale of cars that breached toxic nitrogen oxides emissions rules.  To date, the owners of the 8.5 million affected European cars remain in the cold,  said Harcus Sinclair, which launched its case in January 2016 and has signed up about 41,000 English and Welsh VW drivers. A London trial is expected in early 2019.  VW said it took the trust of its customers very seriously, but it saw no legal basis for consumer lawsuits, as its plans to fix cars in Europe had been coordinated with regulators and price fluctuations for diesel cars were within a  normal range .  All vehicles affected are and have been technically safe and roadworthy. They can be driven on roads without any limitations and can be sold without loss in residual value,  it said in a statement.  Even if we were to hold talks with law firms we would maintain this position.

It's like on TV, though it does look a little smaller,  43-year-old Sylvain Maillard, one of only four lawmakers elected in the first round, told reporters as he admired the marbled halls and clutched a slim leather briefcase.      Inside the case was a map of parliament, details on the location of the bar and the hairdresser's opening hours, a sash in the colors of the French tricolor and a copy of the country's constitution. Maillard will not be the only newcomer to the 577-seat National Assembly. Macron's promise to renew French politics was founded on a commitment that half his candidates would be political novices, rare in a country where political careers typically span decades. Pollsters project the year-old Republic On The Move party will win a crushing majority, perhaps three quarters of the lower house.   It's going to take a little time getting used to,  said Maillard, who has served as a municipal councillor in a Paris district since 2014. He added he hoped to lean on the experience of the party's seasoned veterans.  They will be like older brothers, they will help us out,  Maillard said of the few veterans expected among their ranks. Officials inside Macron's Republic on the Move (LREM) acknowledge that keeping control of discipline in a party with so many novices will pose challenges, and plan a training seminar ahead of the June 27 opening of parliament.   It'll be like vocational training,  Maillard said.  He said he would keep working a day each week for the electronic component distribution firm he co-founded and runs, with a target turnover of 25 million euros ($28.01 million).   That will keep me grounded, to continue having to pay my employees, do payslips, get told off by clients, it's important,  he said as parliament staff walked with him to sign administrative forms.  While past parliaments were traditionally largely made of career politicians, lawyers and doctors, Macron's candidates include business people, engineers and even a former bullfighter making it to the June 18 run-offs.  His party rejects opponents' suggestions they will lack experience, and says they be representative of French society.   It's not just about the numbers (of LREM lawmakers) but about having the right expertise,  Maillard said.   We have no blank check (from voters), we're here to get on with the job.

In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said its output rose by 336,000 barrels per day (bpd) in May to 32.14 million bpd led by a rebound in Nigeria and Libya, which were exempted from supply cuts because unrest had curbed their output. The boost means OPEC is pumping more than its forecast of average global demand for its crude this year, hindering efforts to reduce a glut. But Libyan and Nigerian output remains volatile, meaning the gain may not last. OPEC said oil inventories in industrialized countries dropped in April and would fall further in the rest of the year, but a recovery in U.S. production was slowing efforts to get rid of excess supply.  The rebalancing of the market is under way, but at a slower pace, given the changes in fundamentals since December, especially the shift in U.S. supply from an expected contraction to positive growth,  OPEC said in the report. Oil prices gave up gains on Tuesday after the release of the report to trade toward $48 a barrel, below the $60 level that top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia would like to see and less than half the level of mid-2014. Under the deal to support the market, OPEC is curbing output by about 1.2 million bpd while Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting half as much. With the glut slow to shift, producers agreed in May to prolong the accord until March 2018. In the report, OPEC pointed to continued high compliance by its members with the supply deal and said oil stocks in industrialized nations fell in April - although they are still 251 million barrels above the five-year average. Supply from 11 OPEC members with production targets under the accord - all except Libya and Nigeria - averaged 29.729 million bpd last month, according to figures from secondary sources that OPEC uses to monitor output.  That means OPEC has again complied more than 100 percent with the plan, according to a Reuters calculation. OPEC did not publish a compliance number. Saudi Reports Lower Output Saudi Arabia, which has voluntarily cut production below its OPEC target, told OPEC it lowered output further by about 66,000 bpd in May to 9.88 million bpd. OPEC cut its estimate of oil supply growth from producers outside the group this year to 840,000 bpd from 950,000 bpd, following the decision to extend the curbs. It even trimmed its forecast for growth in the United States, where shale producers have gained impetus from the higher prices brought about by the OPEC-led cut.  U.S. output is still expected to rise by 800,000 bpd in 2017, contributing almost all the non-OPEC gain. Due to the lower supply now expected from all outside producers, OPEC raised the forecast demand for its crude this year by 100,000 bpd to 32.02 million bpd - below its May output. Should the recovery in Nigeria and Libya prove sustainable and others not cut more, the market could remain in surplus. This could lead to calls for Nigeria and Libya's output to be capped - a step OPEC says is too early for now. The OPEC production figures are for 13 members and do not yet include Equatorial Guinea, which joined last month.

Connecting with Android Pay will enable WorldRemit customers in developed markets like Europe or North America to make instant international money transfers to reach the 112 million accounts available via WorldRemit's network of payment channels.  London-based WorldRemit says it handles about three-quarters of mobile phone-based international money transfers, a small but fast-growing segment of the global $575 billion worldwide remittance market. Recipients using WorldRemit can up pick cash or deposit money in banks or mobile money accounts or top up mobile accounts.  Android Pay is a secure way for smartphone users to store credit, debit or loyalty cards to make payments online or in stores which Google has set up in about 15 of the world's most advanced markets since launching it two years ago. In effect, smartphone users where Android Pay is available will have a simple and secure way to make money transfers to the 125 countries where WorldRemit operates. A 3D printed Android logo is seen in front of a displayed cyber code in this illustration taken March 22, 2016.Dado Ruvic/Illustration Our customers often complete money transfer transactions while talking to family or friends on WhatsApp,  WorldRemit Chief Executive Ismail Ahmed said in an interview last week at the MoneyConf financial technology conference in Madrid.  Anything we can do to simplify that process is a big thing for us.  Ahmed, a former United Nations development advisor from Somaliland, set up WorldRemit in 2010 and has raised nearly $150 million in equity funding from venture firms including Accel and TCV and another $45 million in debt financing. Once Android Pay is set up, transfers can be done in five clicks via the WorldRemit service, the company said. Using this route, customers no longer have to re-enter credit card details or pass additional security tests that can derail transactions. The cost of transfers via Android Pay are in line with other credit or debit card processing fees it charges - normally well under 5 percent - WorldRemit said.   WorldRemit makes money by charging basic handling fees and a small mark-up on foreign exchange rates, which typically undercut rates charged by traditional, agent-based transfer firms like Western Union and MoneyGram. Online payments firm PayPal began offering Android Pay to U.S. customers for domestic shopping or other transactions in April, but has not expanded internationally.

In part, this reflects improved near-term economic prospects for EMs. Fitch forecasts economic growth in emerging markets to increase to 4.7% in 2017 and 4.8% in 2018 from 4.0% in 2015 and 4.2% in 2016 as Russia and Brazil return to positive growth, commodity prices have stabilised and Chinese growth has surprised on the upside. However, in most cases EM banks whose Outlooks have reverted to Stable have done so after rating downgrades, both of banks and sovereigns, in such markets as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Costa Rica and Oman. Furthermore, the proportion of EMEA banks on Negative Outlook, which are concentrated in EMEA and Latin America (LatAm) remains significant; these include major lenders in the large LatAm markets of Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. EM banks' credit profiles remain under pressure, to varying degrees, due to weaker than historical growth, commodity prices and currencies. Dollar strength and signs of a shift in China's policy stance could also weigh on emerging markets, and economic growth is likely to remain subdued in Brazil, Mexico and Turkey.

Slower demand growth helped stall the acceleration of greenhouse gases emissions for a third year to levels not seen since the 1980s, although emissions remained well above targets set out by nations in Paris in 2015 to fight climate change, BP said. Global energy demand grew by 1 percent in 2016, a rate similar to those seen in the previous two years but well below the 10-year average rate of 1.8 percent, BP said in its benchmark Statistical Review of World Energy.  This is a third year where we've seen weak growth in world energy demand… The new normal is that all of this growth is coming from developing economies,  particularly China and India, BP Chief Economist Spencer Dale told reporters. China's growth during 2015 and 2016, 1.2 and 1.3 percent respectively, although still the strongest in the world, marked its lowest over a two-year period since 1997-98. While the slowing energy demand growth was a result of sluggish global economic activity, it also stemmed from more efficient of engines and factories, he said. Among fossil fuels, oil consumption grew at the fastest annual rate at 1.6 percent last year as low crude prices boosted consumption. Oil production grew by half a percent, or 400,000 barrels per day, the lowest gain since 2009, as energy companies slashed spending. U.S. shale, or tight, oil production fell dramatically last year but has rebounded strongly in recent months as oil prices have risen, a factor that the market should get used to, Dale said.  U.S. tight oil is like a Weeble: It falls off but then it bounces back up again,  Dale said.  Any sense of trying to kill tight oil makes no sense.  As oil demand growth continues to outstrip production growth, global oil stocks which have plagued the market since 2014 will start falling  more materially  in the second half of this year, Dale said. Gas saw similar growth to oil. Cheaper and abundant gas supplies in the United States and China's drive to switch to cleaner feedstock for its power plants led to a 1.7 percent drop in demand for coal, the most pollutant fossil fuel. Coal's share in the energy mix declined to its lowest since 2004 at around 28 percent. Production saw its largest ever annual drop at 6.2 percent, BP said.  It feels to me like we are seeing a decisive break in coal relative to the past,  Dale said. Renewables Surge Renewables such as solar and wind power were the fastest growing source of energy, rising by 12 percent and accounting for a third of the overall growth in demand. Still, renewables provide only 4 percent of the world's primary energy as China overtook the United States for the first time as the largest producer of renewable power. The slowing growth in energy demand, the shift to cleaner fuels and higher energy efficiency meant that carbon emissions grew by 0.1 percent last year, similar to the previous two years, making it the lowest three-year average for emissions growth since 1981-83.  While welcome, it is not yet clear how much of this break from the past is structural and will persist. We need to keep up our focus and efforts on reducing carbon emissions,  BP CEO Bob Dudley said.

At the same time, Fitch has affirmed the bank's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A', Short-Term IDR at 'F1' and Viability Rating at 'a'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS AND VR The Outlook revision reflects Fitch's view that the activities of Banque Martin Maurel (BMM) that are to be integrated into RCB could result in a higher risk appetite. Fitch expects RCB's underwriting standards to remain low-risk. However, if the bank does not reduce higher-risk lending activities undertaken by BMM, which include lending to medium-sized corporates, this would indicate an increased risk appetite and ultimately result in a downgrade of the ratings. RCB's ratings are based on the bank's leading franchise in advisory services in France, a stable business model that includes some diversification from asset-gathering activities, the bank's resilient profitability and a sound funding profile. The ratings also take into consideration the negative impact of the integration of BMM on asset quality and RCB's moderate size. RCB is the market leader in mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) advisory business in France in terms of number of deals. The bank provides advice to a client base that ranges from large corporates to SMEs and is particularly strong in advising on asset sales. RCB is also present in other European countries, mainly in Germany, Italy and Spain, through a partnership with another Rothschild & Co group entity. RCB's franchise in private banking is adequate and will be reinforced by the integration of BMM, expected on 1 July 2017, which is well-established in the south east of France. RCB's business model, although dominated by financial advisory activities, has proven fairly stable and benefits from some diversification provided by asset-gathering activities. RCB is also developing its debt restructuring and advisory business as well as equity advisory, which provide some diversification from the M&A; business. RCB's risk appetite has been modest, in Fitch's view, partly driven by the partnership structure of the bank, which leaves general partners personally liable for its liabilities. RCB's lending activities are fairly limited, essentially to Lombard loans. BMM has more significant lending activities than RCB as it also extends housing loans to private banking clients and corporate loans. The combined loan book will include a majority of low-risk Lombard and housing loans, but the merged bank's asset quality will be weaker than RCB's standalone asset quality, which benefited from the absence of any material volume of impaired loans. We view favourably the strong involvement of the Rothschild family in the management and strategic decisions of RCB. This supports a key priority of the bank, which is to avoid any damage to the family name. RCB's profitability has been resilient and strong throughout the years, with financial advisory traditionally constituting the bulk of RCB's profit before tax. The performance of this activity has proved resilient, given the focus on a large number of smaller transactions compared with the big M&A; players. RCB's capital ratios are lower than those of purely private banking peers, but they are commensurate with the moderate risk profile of the bank. The capital base is small in absolute terms, and net income is fully distributed to the partners, a consequence of RCB's legal partnership structure. RCB is largely funded by deposits gathered through its private banking activities, providing it with a stable funding source. The bank manages its liquidity carefully, and the bulk of its assets are short-term. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The bank's Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'No Floor' reflect Fitch's view that any external support to RCB, if needed, would be uncertain. Fitch views support from the French authorities as unlikely given the recent resolution legislation and the bank's lack of systemic importance. RCB is fully controlled by Rothschild & Co, which is a listed financial company regulated by the French banking authority and mainly owned by the French and English branches of the Rothschild family. RCB would look to Rothschild & Co or its shareholders for support. Fitch believes that it is the Rothschild family's priority to uphold the reputation of all family companies and that resources would be made available to support RCB, to the best of the family's ability, should the need arise. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND VR The ratings would likely be downgraded if RCB does not maintain its low-risk appetite. Fitch expects the bank to align its underwriting standards, after the integration of BMM, with RCB's traditionally low-risk appetite. Failure to reduce risk appetite, including in the bank's corporate loan book, could result in a downgrade. The bank's ratings are also sensitive to deterioration in asset quality or in capitalisation. A tarnishing of the Rothschild reputation and loss of franchise would put negative pressure on RCB's ratings. RCB's small capital base constrains upside to its ratings. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR An upgrade of RCB's Support Rating and upward revision of its Support Rating Floor would be contingent on a positive change in the French sovereign's propensity to support its banks and in the systemic importance of RCB. While not impossible, this is highly unlikely, in Fitch's view.

According to Valor, which did not specify how it got the information, a subsidiary of Chile's Empresas Copec SA known as Arauco has hired Banco Santander SA to work on a proposal. Morgan Stanley & Co is advising Fibria, the world's No. 1 eucalyptus pulpmaker, Valor added. Another potential contender is Suzano Papel & Celulose SA , which is said to have hired two unidentified large Brazilian investment banks to analyze a bid, Valor said. Two bankers told Valor under condition of anonymity that Eldorado's equity could be worth between 3 billion reais and 4 billion reais ($904 million and $1.2 billion). With debt hovering at 8 billion reais, Eldorado could soon be put up for sale after two key members of Brazil's Batista family were ensnared in a corruption scandal, sources have told Reuters in recent weeks. Eldorado lenders are pressing for a sale of the company, Valor noted. J&F; Investimentos SA, the company overseeing the business of the Batistas, has 81 percent of Eldorado. The remaining 19 percent is owned by Brazilian pension funds, Petros Fundação and Funcef Fundação dos Economiarios, and special purpose vehicle FIP Olímpia. São Paulo-based J&F; and Suzano declined to comment on the Valor report. Fibria and the banks did not have an immediate comment. The media office of Santiago-based Copec did not answer early calls seeking comment. Last October, J&F; started talks to buy out the stakes that both Petros and Funcef have in Eldorado. Both Joesley and Wesley Batista, the family members that last month entered the plea deal with Brazilian prosecutors, want to speak to bidders of Eldorado first before hiring an advisor for a sale, Valor said, citing banking executives with knowledge of the matter. Fibria seems the most unlikely suitor because a key shareholder, state development bank BNDES, is unlikely to approve a transaction that could shore up the Batistas, Valor said, without saying how it got the information. In their plea bargain, both Batistas ensnared President Michel Temer in a corruption scandal, unleashing retaliatory actions from his government against the group. $1 = 3.3176 reais Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Additional reporting by Felipe Iturrieta in Santiago; Editing by Bernadette Baum","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eldorado-brasil-ma-idUSL1N1JA0DG"},

(Reuters) - The Golden State Warriors secured their second NBA championship in three seasons with a 129-120 Game Five win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday, capping a near-perfect run through the playoffs. The Warriors, who beat Cleveland in the 2015 Finals only to lose to them last year after squandering a 3-1 series lead, went a record-setting 16-1 in the playoffs, their only loss coming in Game Four of the best-of-seven championship. The win provided redemption for the Warriors, who brought Kevin Durant over from the Oklahoma City Thunder last offseason to bolster their already high-powered offense. Durant, who lost in his only previous Finals appearance in 2012, led the way for the Warriors with 39 points and was relieved after feeling pressure to deliver prior to the game.   I couldn't sleep for two days,  Durant, who was named the Finals MVP, said during an on-court interview.  I was anxious, I was jittery.  I just wanted to lay it all out there.

To be back here and bring gold Larry (O'Brien trophy) back home, I'm just excited to be a part of this group and accomplish something special. I'm ready to do it again.  Slideshow (13 Images)An unprecedented third straight Finals clash between the Warriors and Cavaliers was hyped as the ultimate championship rubber match and expected to be the antidote for a postseason that had little in the way of drama. But that idea fizzled fast when the Warriors opened with a pair of lopsided wins at home, fought back late to steal the next game in Cleveland and then, after dropping their first game of the postseason, closed out the series at home. In the end, the Cavaliers simply did not have enough top-class talent to topple the Warriors, even with four-time league MVP James doing all he could to keep his team in it. For James, already a three-times champion, the loss puts him in rare company as only the fourth player to come up short in five NBA Finals. Cleveland's inability to give the Warriors much of a fight has already sparked talk that James, who left the team in 2010 for Miami before returning four years later, could consider another move during 2018 free agency.

The Socceroos got off to a terrible start when center back Bailey Wright gave away possession with the second pass of the game, allowing Diego Souza to hammer home a low shot to groans from most of the 49,000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Souza wrapped up the win for a second-string Brazil side with a header in added time after Thiago Silva headed the second from a goalmouth scramble in the 62nd minute and substitute Taison finished off a brilliant team goal in the 75th. Australia, who play world champions Germany in Group B at the Confederations Cup in Russia on Monday, entered the stadium with cautious optimism after last week's win over Saudi Arabia reignited hopes of a fourth straight World Cup appearance. But the crushing early blow of Souza's early goal in Tuesday's game left Ange Postecoglou's side rattled and they were only spared further punishment in the first half by Brazil's failure to convert several early chances. Australia were humbled 6-0 away by five-times world champions Brazil when the teams last met in 2013, which was a prelude to former coach Holger Osieck's dismissal and replacement by Postecoglou. Postecoglou will wake up to some stinging headlines but he was philosophical in defeat, and said responsibility for the second half blow-out lay with him making a raft of changes.

There is no plan B. We're not going back,  Ganesh Bell, chief digital officer of GE Power, the group's largest industrial business, told Reuters on the sidelines of a Berlin conference to promote its digital products. Bell was speaking a day after GE named insider John Flannery as its next CEO, taking over from long-serving Jeff Immelt, who reshaped the company to sharpen its focus on technology but failed to deliver profit growth fast enough for some investors. Flannery said on Monday that he will conduct a swift review of the conglomerate's business portfolio with  no constraint , but that digital efforts will be at the heart of its strategy. Bell said that all of GE's senior managers, including Flannery, are  believers big time  in Immelt's push to invest billions of dollars to build a digital business that marries electronic sensors and analytic computing with industrial equipment.  Investors are starting to get the story. What they haven't grasped fully is that it is not just about making existing business more efficient but about a whole new franchise,  he said. Beth Comstock, who runs the innovations unit at the maker of jet engines and power plants, noted that Flannery was part of the strategy team that drove the digital push and had seen positive results in his own healthcare unit.  You don't go digital at your own peril,  she said. Immelt had been due to speak at the Berlin conference, but pulled out after Monday' announcement, leaving Comstock to speak  in his place. Comstock admitted that it can be difficult to persuade GE  customers of the need to digitize, even though 50 billion machines are expected to have online connectivity by 2020.  The more we can show how we have digitized, the more likely they are to try it,  she said.  They want examples of others that have done it.  Comstock said that such initiatives represent a huge opportunity for GE, with only 30 percent of European companies currently analyzing data from their industrial equipment to inform decisions. She cited the example of DB Cargo, the logistics arm of the German railways company, which she said had improved fleet reliability since adopting GE's software on its locomotives.  We have to accept that the old is going away and the new has not yet fully emerged,  she said.  Editing by David Goodman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-strategy-idUSKBN1941R1"},

Syria's vast deserts have become the main theater of war in recent weeks as rival forces race to capture ground from the jihadist group, which is slowly retreating on several fronts.  The area between Ithriya and Tabqa, west of Islamic State's de facto Syrian capital Raqqa, is important for the army since it can be used to attack government-held towns and supply routes.  According to the Hezbollah military media unit, the army has punched southwards to the Ithriya-Tabqa highway, a distance of about 20 miles (32 km) from its positions south of Maskaneh.  The road was used by Islamic State to attack positions along the government's main supply route to Aleppo near Ithriya, and, if fully captured, would help the army advance into the desert.  It captured the villages of Rajm Askar, Bir Inbaj, Zahar Um Baj, Jab Aziz, Jab al-Ghanem, Abu Sousa and Jab Abyad from the jihadist group, the media unit said.  Syria's army is aided in the six-year-long war by Shi'ite militias backed by Iran, including Lebanon's Hezbollah, and by Russian air power.  A war monitor, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, also said the Syrian army had advanced in that area. Al-Rusafa oil field is located nearby. The advance will help the army to relieve pressure on the Ithriya-Khanaser road, part of the government's supply route to Aleppo, the Observatory said.  The army has also launched attacks to push Islamic State back from the Salamiya-Ithriya road, part of the same supply route, in recent weeks.  The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group of militias backed by a U.S.-led coalition, holds Tabqa, northeast of the advances the army was reported to have made on Tuesday.  A week into its assault on Raqqa, the SDF on Monday reached the walls of the Old City from the eastern suburbs, the war monitor and a militia spokesman said. It is also pushing into Raqqa from the west and the north. Reporting By Angus McDowall; Editing by Janet Lawrence","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-army-idUSKBN1941QO"},

The company also reported a 5 percent dip in same-store sales for the third quarter ending April 29. Neiman Marcus posted a net loss of $24.9 million in the quarter, compared to a profit of $3.8 million, a year earlier. Apparel retailers including Gap Inc and Victoria's Secret owner L Brands Inc have faced lackluster demand amid stiff competition from Amazon.com Inc and fast-fashion retailers such as H&M; and Zara. Retailers have struggled to cope with changes in consumer tastes as shoppers increasingly spend on travel and big-ticket home improvement items and less on apparel and accessories. Dallas-based Neiman Marcus earlier this year shelved plans for an initial public offering and said it was exploring options, including changes to its capital structure change or a sale of the company, as it struggles with an enormous debt load. Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson's Bay Co had approached Neiman Marcus about a potential combination earlier this year, but talks have stalled, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. on.wsj.com/2reiaQm (Reporting by Karina Dsouza in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/neiman-marcus-gp-results-idUSL3N1JA40R"},

Africa's most populous country  has recorded about 14,500 suspected cases and at least 1,150 deaths so far this year - up from 33 in 2016 - in two thirds of its 36 states, said the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Nigeria in April launched a mass vaccination campaign in its northwestern states, yet there is a limited global supply of affordable and long-lasting vaccines for the C strain of meningitis, said medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). At least 1.3 million meningitis C vaccines have been acquired to date, according to the government, yet aid agencies say several more million are needed to contain the outbreak. Previous vaccination campaigns to protect against frequent meningitis A outbreaks - more than 2,000 people died in 2009 - have allowed the C strain to become dominant and spread widely among the unprotected population, said several health experts.  This outbreak is not just one of the worst in number of cases and deaths, but in terms of how far it has spread across Nigeria,  Miriam Alia, a vaccination and outbreak response adviser at MSF, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. The shortage of vaccines for meningitis C means they can only be used to respond reactively to such outbreaks, rather than to prevent future epidemics in high risk areas, she added. Meningitis is the inflammation of tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord, which can be caused by viral or bacterial infections. It spreads mainly through kisses, sneezes and coughs, and symptoms include fever, headaches and vomiting. Lessons to Learn The introduction of the MenAfriVac vaccine in 2010, costing just 50 U.S. cents a shot, means meningitis A is now rare across Africa's so-called  meningitis belt  from Senegal to Ethiopia. Yet most vaccines currently used for meningitis C outbreaks in Africa are first generation vaccines which are in short supply as they are being phased out in other parts of the world. The more effective and long-lasting vaccines against the C strain are pricier, and not readily available to respond to the epidemic in Nigeria, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.  The very limited supply of vaccines to control outbreaks of meningitis C can affect our ability to control these epidemics,  said Olivier Ronveaux, a meningitis expert with the WHO. Vaccine maker Serum Institute of India is working on a vaccine targeting five meningitis strains, which could be available by 2020 and turn out to be a 'supervaccine' if effective and safe as MenAfriVac, health experts say. But this means that laboratories are not going to produce many meningitis C vaccines, as they will only have a market for three years, leaving current stocks low, said Alia from MSF. In the meantime, aid agencies are working to contain the current outbreak in a country where basic healthcare is limited in rural areas.  We are also looking beyond the current outbreak, and learning lessons for future epidemics when it comes to aspects like the positioning of resources and case management,  said Modibo Kassogue of the U.N. children's fund (UNICEF) in Nigeria.

Beth Comstock, who runs the innovations unit at the maker of jet engines and power plants, noted that Flannery was part of the strategy team that drove the digital push and had seen positive results in his own healthcare unit.  You don't go digital at your own peril,  she said. Immelt had been due to speak at the Berlin conference, but pulled out after Monday' announcement, leaving Comstock to speak  in his place. Comstock admitted that it can be difficult to persuade GE  customers of the need to digitize, even though 50 billion machines are expected to have online connectivity by 2020.  The more we can show how we have digitized, the more likely they are to try it,  she said.  They want examples of others that have done it.  Comstock said that such initiatives represent a huge opportunity for GE, with only 30 percent of European companies currently analyzing data from their industrial equipment to inform decisions. She cited the example of DB Cargo, the logistics arm of the German railways company, which she said had improved fleet reliability since adopting GE's software on its locomotives.  We have to accept that the old is going away and the new has not yet fully emerged,  she said.  Editing by David Goodman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/ge-strategy-idUSL8N1JA2VB"},

The company said it plans to enter Kansas, Missouri and Nevada in 2018, as well as expand its operations in six existing markets: Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. The move is in contrast to some other insurers, which have blamed Republicans for not doing enough to stabilize the marketplace, particularly in guaranteeing the continued payment of Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies next year. The subsidies are available to low-income Americans who buy individual health insurance on the exchanges created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. Republican lawmakers and Trump have promised to repeal and replace the law but have disagreed over the details, creating uncertainty at a time when insurers must submit plans and premium rates for 2018.  Centene recognizes there is uncertainty of new healthcare legislation, but we are well positioned to continue providing accessible, high quality and culturally-sensitive healthcare services to our members,  CEO Michael Neidorff said in a statement. Anthem Inc, which has long said that uncertainty over the payments used to make insurance more affordable could cause it to exit markets next year, last week announced it would exit most of the Ohio market in 2018.

Pakistan has been keen for years to build a cascade of mega dams along the Indus flowing down from the Himalayas, but has struggled to raise money from international institutions amid opposition from its nuclear-armed neighbor India. Those ambitions have been revived by China's Belt and Road infrastructure plans for Pakistan, a key cog in Beijing's creation of a modern-day Silk Road network of trade routes connecting Asia with Europe and Africa. The $12-$14 billion Diamer-Bhasha dam should generate 4,500 megawatts (MW) of electricity, and a vast new reservoir would regulate the flow of water to farmland that is vulnerable to increasingly erratic weather patterns. Iqbal, the Islamabad lead on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), said a Chinese company from a Beijing-picked shortlist and a local partner would build the dam over a 10-year period, and work should begin in the  next financial year , which begins in July.  This water reservoir is most critical for food security in Pakistan, so is a very high priority project for Pakistan,  Iqbal told Reuters late on Monday at his ministerial home in Islamabad. China and Pakistan signed a memorandum of understanding in December for Beijing to help fund and develop Pakistan's Indus Basin dams, though no timelines have been released. Pakistan estimates there is 40,000 MW of hydro potential. The Diamer-Bhasha dam and reservoir would displace more than 4,200 families in nearby areas and submerge a large section of the Karakoram Highway to China, Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority estimates. Iqbal said Pakistani and Chinese engineers are also surveying other projects, including the 7,100 MW Bunji hydro power project that will be the first in the cascade that stretches down to the Tarbela Dam near Islamabad. Ahsan Iqbal Pakistan's Minister of Planning and Development poses for a portrait after an interview in Islamabad, Pakistan June 12, 2017.Caren FirouzIndia's foreign ministry and ministry for water resources did not respond to requests for comment.  India has previously opposed any construction in the Indus Basin it claims as its own, and has criticized CPEC because the $57 billion corridor runs across disputed territory. India this year fast-tracked $15 billion worth of dam projects on its side of Kashmir, despite fears from Islamabad that the power stations will disrupt vital Indus water flows into Pakistan. Slideshow (3 Images)Iqbal, a close ally of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, said India needs to  stop its myopic thinking towards CPEC  and accept the Chinese-funded project is going ahead. Better still would be for India to become part of Beijing's Belt and Road plans, he said.  $20 Billion Plus  Future CPEC plans are increasingly focused on how Beijing can help build up Pakistan's ailing industries, creating special economic zones and opening up sectors from mining to agriculture to Chinese firms. But Iqbal said infrastructure construction won't stop, with contracts set to be signed for roads and for mass rail transport systems in Quetta, Peshawar and Karachi. He said about $10 billion in new deals should be signed in the next year on top of Chinese pledges topping $50 billion, and that was likely to double by 2020.  I would say conservatively $20 billion plus (in new investment by 2020),  Iqbal said, adding this would also include private investment.

There are rumours that there are even a million Erasmus babies.  The Commission can't take the credit for that but I very much welcome this way of bringing Europe closer together.  The celebrations in Strasbourg hailed the programme taking in its 9 millionth student since its founding in 1987. Erasmus funding and networking helps university students follow some of their studies in other EU countries outside their homeland. With the now 28-nation Union reeling from the blow dealt to 60 years of peaceful postwar integration by the unprecedented British decision to quit, the former premier of Luxembourg urged member states to extend funding for the educational programme.  Erasmus,  Juncker said,  is a good response to the stupidity of selfish nationalisms and of turning inwards.

Retail sales volumes excluding cars and building materials rose 1.0 percent in April from March, government statistics agency IBGE said, compared with forecasts for a drop of 0.55 percent by economists polled by Reuters.     The monthly growth rate was the fastest for April in nine years, IBGE said.     The institute also revised up March data to show a drop of 1.2 percent, instead of the 1.9-percent decline originally reported. Sales dropped 0.4 percent in February.     Consumption has decreased over the past year as a deep recession left a record 14 million Brazilians unemployed. Economists expect consumer spending to start recovering in coming months as interest rates and inflation drop, helping the economy gain speed.     Data earlier this month showed Brazil's annual inflation rate tumbled more than expected in May to 3.6 percent, the lowest in 10 years.                  As a result, supermarket sales rose 2.0 percent in April, up from a decline of 5.6 percent in March, IBGE said.      Lower inflation has restored consumers' purchasing power,  IBGE economist Isabella Nunes said.     Sales grew 1.9 percent from a year earlier             , compared with expectations for a 1.3 percent drop.

Rohan Ramchandani, Richard Usher and Chris Ashton, formerly of Citi (C.N), JP Morgan Chase (JPM.N) and Barclays (BARC.L) - dubbed the  Cartel  - were indicted by the Department of Justice in January. A preliminary hearing in New York has been scheduled for July 17. As per the bail terms agreed with the DOJ, the three men, who all deny wrongdoing, will be able to return to and stay in Britain until the case comes to trial.  Mr Ramchandani has agreed to travel voluntarily to the USA to stand trial and clear his name. He has not committed any criminal offense,  said Alison Geary, a lawyer at WilmerHale in London acting on behalf of Ramchandani, in a statement.  Sara George, partner at Stephenson Harwood acting on behalf of Chris Ashton, said in a statement:  Chris Ashton has reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice which will allow him to travel voluntarily to the United States to stand trial for an offense ... which he did not commit.  Jonathan Pickworth, a lawyer at White & Case, representing Usher, said in a statement that his client  welcomes the opportunity to defend himself and set the record straight – the first time he has had such opportunity in the four years since this investigation began.  The three men were members of the  Cartel  electronic chatroom in which they are alleged to have shared sensitive client order information to manipulate exchange rates. Britain's Serious Fraud Office in March last year closed its own criminal investigation, concluding that there was  insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.  The global FX investigation into allegations that the  Cartel  and others rigged benchmark FX rates resulted in the world's biggest banks paying $10 billion in fines and dozens of traders being fired.

Related CoverageSouth Korea names new minister to handle North Korea ties We will come up with measures to deal with North Korean drones,  said an official at South Korea's Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who also declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to the media. North Korean drones are known to have flown over South Korea several times. North Korea has about 300 unmanned aerial vehicles of different types including one designed for reconnaissance as well as combat drones, the United Nations said in a report last year. The North Korean drones recovered in South Korea were probably procured through front companies in China, with parts manufactured in China, the Czech Republic, Japan and the United States, it added. The neighbors are technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce and not a peace treaty. Later on Tuesday, the South's military said a North Korean soldier defected to the South across their heavily mined border, known as the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Such crossings across the land border are unusual but not unprecedented, although most of the on average 1,000 North Koreans who defect to the South every year travel through China.  The last crossing by a North Korean soldier across the DMZ was in September last year. South Korea and the United States agreed last year to deploy the THAAD unit in response to North Korea's relentless development of its ballistic missiles, and nuclear weapons, in defiance of U.N. sanctions. China strongly objects to the THAAD system saying its powerful radar can probe deep into its territory, undermining its security and upsetting a regional balance. China also says the system does nothing to deter North Korea. South Korea and the United States say the system is aimed solely at defending against North Korean missiles.

The company, which has not reported an annual profit in the past six years, also said it was on track to meet its target of saving $1.25 billion in costs this year. Sears said the bulk of the layoffs were related to its corporate workforce at its Hoffman Estates, Illinois headquarters. Sears, controlled by billionaire investor Eddie Lampert, also said it would cut a  small fraction  of jobs related to stores it shuttered last week. The company has laid out plans to close 150 stores this year. Sears, once the largest U.S. retailer, has been struggling to turn around its business for years amid intensifying competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). In March, Sears raised doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern following years of losses and declining sales. A tepid U.S. retail market in recent months has forced Sears and other retailers including Macy's Inc (M.N) to close stores and cut costs. Sears said on Tuesday cost-cutting efforts had helped it save nearly $1 billion so far this fiscal year.

Ben Ngubane, who had been chairman since 2015, is leaving two weeks after the government reversed Eskom's decision to reinstate Brian Molefe as chief executive. The chairman's departure comes a day after a South African lawmaker said parliament would launch a graft and governance probe into the state-owned company. Ngubane did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday, but Eskom board spokesman Khulani Qoma told 702 Talk Radio:  He said to me it was time to move on for personal reasons . Reports on leaked documents by non-profit investigative journalism group Amabhungane have put Eskom at the centre of allegations of improper dealings in government contracts by business friends of President Jacob Zuma. Eskom was also named in a report by the Public Protector, a constitutionally mandated corruption watchdog, which raised questions over coal deals between the utility and a company controlled by the Gupta family, business friends of Zuma. Qoma said on Monday that Ngubane had said that  the board would welcome any investigation into the affairs of Eskom .  Complex Situation  Ngubane's departure leaves Eskom without a leader as Matshela Koko, who had been acting CEO until last month, has been suspended after the utility's board said it would investigate his conduct.  Ngubane has been effectively running Eskom. I think this put him in an impossible and complex situation that basically he would rather be without,  Peter Attard Montalto, an analyst at Nomura International in London, said in a note. Eskom, which provides virtually all the power for Africa's most industrialised economy, has also provoked infighting in the ruling African National Congress (ANC) over the reinstatement and subsequent departure of Zuma ally Molefe.  We view this resignation as an attempt to avoid being held accountable for his role in recent events at Eskom,  the ANC said in a statement.  As chairperson of the board, Dr Ngubane was central in processes which led to the now rescinded reappointment of Mr Brian Molefe at Eskom.  South Africa's Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown has appointed board member Zethembe Khoza as acting chairman of Eskom, her office said in a statement. Khoza assumes the role in the middle of the building of three new coal-fired power stations, and Eskom is also considering building a second nuclear plant.

On March 1, there were $8.6 trillion of negative-yielding sovereign debt. The value of negative-yielding European and Japanese government debt peaked at about $11.7 trillion last June, according to the rating agency.  Calming political fears related to the French election and a weaker dollar spurred the increase in the total,  Fitch said in a statement. Those fears had stemmed from whether anti-European Union candidate Marine Le Pen would win the French presidency, pushing up the yields on French government bonds. But centrist Emmanuel Macron beat Le Pen in a run-off on May 7, reviving investor demand for French debt which sent some of their yields back into negative territory. On Sunday, his Republic on the Move (LREM) party scored well in a first-round parliamentary election, putting it on track to capture as many as three quarters of National Assembly seats on June 28, according to pollsters. The yield on five-year French government notes was -0.255 percent on Monday, down near 1 basis point from Friday. It reached 0.210 percent on March 24, which was the highest since October 2015, Reuters data showed. The amount of French negative-yielding sovereign debt outstanding climbed to $1.0 trillion from about $750 billion on March 1, Fitch said. On the currency front, a weaker dollar contributed to a $400 billion increase in the value of negative yielding debt since March 1, it said. On May 31, the euro stood at $1.1241, stronger than $1.0506 on March 1, while the dollar was at 110.75 yen, weaker than 113.71 yen on March 1, according to Reuters data.  Higher yields have alleviated some pressure for investors but challenges remain, as yields in many developed economies are still near historic lows,  Fitch said.

A preliminary hearing in New York has been scheduled for July 17. As per the bail terms agreed with the DOJ, the three men, who all deny wrongdoing, will be able to return to and stay in Britain until the case comes to trial.  Mr Ramchandani has agreed to travel voluntarily to the USA to stand trial and clear his name.

Sara George, partner at Stephenson Harwood acting on behalf of Chris Ashton, said in a statement:  Chris Ashton has reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice which will allow him to travel voluntarily to the United States to stand trial for an offense ... which he did not commit.  Jonathan Pickworth, a lawyer at White & Case, representing Usher, said in a statement that his client  welcomes the opportunity to defend himself and set the record straight – the first time he has had such opportunity in the four years since this investigation began.  The three men were members of the  Cartel  electronic chatroom in which they are alleged to have shared sensitive client order information to manipulate exchange rates. Britain's Serious Fraud Office in March last year closed its own criminal investigation, concluding that there was  insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.

The initial four-year trial of Jovica Stanisic, the former head of Serbia's State Security Service (DB) and Franko Simatovic, his alleged right-hand man, resulted in an acquittal in 2013, but an appeals judge ordered a retrial. The trial is seen as the last remaining case that could establish a judicial link between late Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's Belgrade government and atrocities committed in Bosnia during the 1992-95 war that followed the collapse of multi-ethnic Yugoslavia. Stanisic and Simatovic are accused of having  established, trained, armed, supported and directed  some of the most notorious Serb militias, including the groups known as the  Scorpions  and  Arkan's Tigers.

The pair were acquitted at their first trial, the U.N. court ruling there was no evidence that any orders they issued were  specifically directed  at aiding the commission of the crimes.

Rohan Ramchandani, Richard Usher and Chris Ashton, formerly of Citi (C.N), JP Morgan Chase (JPM.N) and Barclays (BARC.L) - dubbed the  Cartel  - were indicted by the Department of Justice in January. A preliminary hearing in New York has been scheduled for July 17. As per the bail terms agreed with the DOJ, the three men, who all deny wrongdoing, will be able to return to and stay in Britain until the case comes to trial.  Mr Ramchandani has agreed to travel voluntarily to the USA to stand trial and clear his name. He has not committed any criminal offense,  said Alison Geary, a lawyer at WilmerHale in London acting on behalf of Ramchandani, in a statement.  Sara George, partner at Stephenson Harwood acting on behalf of Chris Ashton, said in a statement:  Chris Ashton has reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice which will allow him to travel voluntarily to the United States to stand trial for an offense ... which he did not commit.  Jonathan Pickworth, a lawyer at White & Case, representing Usher, said in a statement that his client  welcomes the opportunity to defend himself and set the record straight – the first time he has had such opportunity in the four years since this investigation began.  The three men were members of the  Cartel  electronic chatroom in which they are alleged to have shared sensitive client order information to manipulate exchange rates. Britain's Serious Fraud Office in March last year closed its own criminal investigation, concluding that there was  insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.  The global FX investigation into allegations that the  Cartel  and others rigged benchmark FX rates resulted in the world's biggest banks paying $10 billion in fines and dozens of traders being fired.

The debt impairment IBA will seek to carry out and enforce in the United States through the auspices of this Court will be implemented through a process that runs roughshod over certain fundamental rights of IBA's creditors,  the creditors said in a statement filed on Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the southern district of New York.  The plan would  benefit equity holders, the largest of which are instrumentalities of the Republic , it said. The group is represented by law firm Shearman and Sterling. IBA, Azerbaijan's largest lender, has petitioned the court to recognise the restructuring process as a so-called foreign main proceeding. Under U.S. Chapter 15 bankruptcy code, recognition of a foreign main proceeding - a proceeding pending in a country where the debtor's centre of main interest is located - can help a foreign entity protect its property in the United States. IBA said last month it was suspending payments on some liabilities and seeking creditors' support to restructure $3.3 billion of debt, mostly owed to foreign creditors.

The milestone was reached after no measles cases originating in the Maldives had been recorded since 2009 and none in Bhutan since 2012, the WHO said. Both countries launched immunisation programmes abound 40 years ago with mass vaccination of people at high risk.  The strongest political commitment, alongside concerted efforts of health workers, officials and partners at all levels, has helped achieve this landmark success,  Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director of WHO Southeast Asia said in a statement. The WHO has set a 2020 deadline for the elimination of measles in the 11 countries it categorises as the Southeast Asia region. The region has averted an estimated 620,000 measles deaths in 2016 after carrying out vaccinations in the 11 countries, the WHO said. Nearly 107 million children were reached with an additional dose of measles vaccine in the region between 2013 and 2016, according to the WHO. Globally, measles remains a leading cause of death among young children in the developing world. The viral disease is spread through coughing and sneezing and can lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation or death. Last year, the Americas became the first region in the world to be free of measles, but last month an outbreak was reported in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Gaps in vaccination coverage against measles also have led to several outbreaks of the disease in Europe in the past year, with both children and young adults affected, according to health officials. The U.N. children's agency said in April cases of measles had surged in famine-threatened Somalia.

The company, which has not reported an annual profit in the past six years, also said it was on track to meet its target of saving $1.25 billion in costs this year. Sears said the bulk of the layoffs were related to its corporate workforce at its Hoffman Estates, Illinois headquarters. Sears, controlled by billionaire investor Eddie Lampert, also said it would cut a  small fraction  of jobs related to stores it shuttered last week. The company has laid out plans to close 150 stores this year. Sears, once the largest U.S. retailer, has been struggling to turn around its business for years amid intensifying competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). In March, Sears raised doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern following years of losses and declining sales. A tepid U.S. retail market in recent months has forced Sears and other retailers including Macy's Inc (M.N) to close stores and cut costs. Sears said on Tuesday cost-cutting efforts had helped it save nearly $1 billion so far this fiscal year.

Erdogan's comments marked the strongest intervention yet by a powerful regional ally of Doha eight days after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar and imposed stringent economic sanctions on it. Qatar denies the allegations of supporting Islamist militants and Iran. The measures against Qatar, a small oil and gas exporter with a population of 2.7 million people, have disrupted imports of food and other materials and caused some foreign banks to scale back business. Qatar, which imported 80 percent of its food from bigger Gulf Arab neighbours before the diplomatic shutdown, has also been talking to Iran and Turkey to secure food and water.  A very grave mistake is being made in Qatar, isolating a nation in all areas is inhumane and against Islamic values. It's as if a death penalty decision has been taken for Qatar,  Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party in Ankara.  Qatar has showed the most decisive stance against terrorist organisation Islamic State alongside Turkey. Victimising Qatar through smear campaigns serves no purpose.  Turkey has maintained good relations with Qatar as well as several of its Gulf Arab neighbours. Turkey and Qatar have both provided support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and backed rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Gulf Arab states have issued no public demands; but a list that has been circulating includes severance of diplomatic relations with Iran, expulsion of all members of the Palestinian Hamas group and of the Muslim Brotherhood, the freezing of all bank accounts of Hamas members, ending support for “terrorist organizations” and ceasing interference in Egyptian affairs. Some analysts say demands could also include closing down satellite channel Al Jazeera, or changing its editorial policy. There has been no breakthrough from Kuwaiti efforts to mediate in the crisis, but a U.S. official in the region said Kuwait was continuing with what is seen as a  slow, painstaking, deliberate  process focused inside the GCC.  The parties are still defining what it is they want out of this confrontation...It's difficult to conduct negotiations if you don't really know what everybody wants. So there is an assessment phase going on right now.  Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdulrahman al-Thani said on Monday Doha  still had no clue  why Arab states had cut ties with his country. He denied Doha supported groups like the Muslim Brotherhood that its neighbours oppose, or had warm ties with their enemy Iran. INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Erdogan would discuss the Gulf rift in a telephone call with U.S. President Donald Trump in coming days, but gave no specific time. Turkey last week approved plans to deploy more troops to a military base it has established in Qatar under a 2014 agreement with the Gulf Arab state. The move was seen as support by regional power and NATO member Turkey to Doha. In Moscow, the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia's King Salman discussed the Qatar crisis in a phone call on Tuesday. The Kremlin said that the row was not helping to unite efforts to try to find a Syria settlement or fight terrorism. Morocco has also waded into the crisis, announcing it was sending plane-loads of food supplies to Doha as part of its Islamic duty during Ramadan. Morocco's Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita was also in the Gulf on a mission by King Mohammed to try to mediate. A diplomatic source in the region said Bourita had met with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan in Abu Dhabi on Monday and was due in Kuwait on Tuesday. He was also expected to fly to Jeddah for talks with Saudi officials on the crisis. So far, the measures against Qatar do not seem to have caused serious shortages of supplies in shops. Some people have even joked about being  blockaded  inside the world's richest country: a Twitter page called  Doha under siege  pokes fun at the prospect of readying  escape yachts , stocking up on caviar and trading Rolex watches for espresso. But an economic downturn could have more dire consequences for the vast majority of Qatar's 2.7 million residents, who are not citizens but foreign workers. Migrant labourers make up 90 percent of Qatar's population, mostly unskilled and dependent on construction projects such as building stadiums for the 2022 soccer World Cup.

Zarif also called on countries in the region to establish a regional forum to resolve conflicts. Relations between the two neighbors are at their most tense in years. Last week Riyadh, along with other Arab governments, severed ties with Qatar, citing its support of Iran as one of the main reasons for the move. Two days later, suicide bombings and shootings in Tehran killed 17 people. Iran repeated accusations that Saudi Arabia funds Islamist militants, including Islamic State. Riyadh has denied involvement in the attacks.    We have intelligence that Saudi Arabia is actively engaged in promoting terrorist groups on the eastern side of Iran, in Baluchistan,  Zarif told a news conference held on the sidelines of a conference on peace mediation in Oslo.  Baluchistan province is home to a Sunni population who form a minority in majority Shi'ite Iran. Iran and Saudi Arabia accuse each other of subverting regional security and support opposite sides in conflicts including those in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.  On the Western side, the same type of activity is being undertaken, again abusing the diplomatic hospitality of our other neighbor,  he said, without elaborating. Iran also accuses the United States for promoting Islamist militancy in the region. Zarif also called on the establishment of a regional forum to resolve differences, made more necessary by the ongoing tensions between Qatar on the one hand and Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain on the other.  It is absolutely imperative... to establish a permanent mechanism for consultation, conversation and conflict resolution in our region, using some variation of the Helsinki approach,  said the foreign minister, in reference to the 1975 Helsinki Accords.  I think it worked at the height of the Cold War here in Europe, it should work (for the Middle East too).  Asked about U.S. President Donald Trump's descriptions of Iran, which he described in a recent tweet as a state sponsoring terrorism, Zarif referred to the fact that most of the September 11 attackers were Saudi nationals, rather than Iranians.   President Trump is trying to change the nationality post-mortem of 15 of the 19 September 11 suicide bombers, or of every other suicide bomber that attacked U.S. soil or any Western country over the past 20 years,  he said.  They did not come from Iran. None. Why is he trying to change history? We are not intimidated by these moves.

Centum said it made 1.03 billion shillings ($10 million) from the sale of investments, down 81 percent from 5.42 billion the previous year, when it made 3.2 billion alone from the sale of a 50 percent stake in a Kenyan shopping mall. Mworia said the company would focus on developing the opportunities it had identified in various sectors such as farming and healthcare to boost returns in the future.  We have taken time to develop opportunities in good sectors so we are not out hunting for new opportunities,  he said. Centum, whose largest shareholder is Chris Kirubi, a Kenyan tycoon who made his fortune from property and hosts a music show on his radio station, has been diversifying into the energy sector to increase earnings. But its 1,000 MW coal-fired plant project has attracted criticism from conservationists on the grounds it would pollute Lamu island, an ancient Swahili settlement on the coast that is a tourist destination and a U.N. World Heritage site. The environmental groups have challenged the construction of the plant before a government tribunal. Mworia dismissed the concerns, saying the power plant would use modern technology and lower the cost of electricity to help the country meet minimum grid demand.  That criticism is based on a lack of knowledge of the technology that exists today in coal and also a lack of understanding of the needs of the sector,  he said. Centum subsidiary Amu Power signed a financing agreement for the coal plant with an undisclosed Chinese investor last month. The amount of investment was also not disclosed. Centum's full-year pretax profit fell to 8.9 billion shillings and the board recommended a dividend of 1.20 shillings per share, up a fifth. Net asset value per share, a key measure of performance for investment firms, rose to 67 shillings from 59 shillings in the prior year, Centum said.

Traders have priced in a 94 percent chance of the Fed raising interest rates. Investors are also looking for more details on the central bank's plans to trim its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The Fed is expected to release its decision at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) on Wednesday. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is due to hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. A bout of profit-taking in richly-valued technology stocks caused the Nasdaq to suffer its worst two-day drop in more than six months on Monday. However, technology stocks appeared to recover on Tuesday. Apple, which had sparked the selloff on Friday, was up 1.08 percent at $146.99 in premarket trading. Other technology heavyweights like Microsoft, Alphabet and Facebook were up marginally.  It (the market) wants to wait and see if the Fed's going to actually raise rates tomorrow and then it wants to wait and see whether or not the tech stocks can actually rebound,  said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer at 50 Parks Investments in Florida.  If (the rebound) holds and the Fed does raise rates tomorrow, it would bode very well for bulls.  At 8:23 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 23 points, or 0.11 percent, with 7,192 contracts changing hands. S&P; 500 e-minis were up 4.25 points, or 0.18 percent, with 201,462 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 19.25 points, or 0.34 percent, on volume of 13,643 contracts. The U.S. Treasury Department unveiled a plan on Monday to make sweeping changes to banking regulations, a prospect that has helped drive Wall Street to record highs. The department proposed to reduce trading restrictions that big banks face, ease their annual stress tests, and curb the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Shares of big banks that stand to benefit from these changes, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, were up in premarket trading on Tuesday. Restaurant chain operator Cheesecake Factory was down 9.2 percent at $52.98 after it warned of a decline in comparable store sales in the current quarter. Tesla was up 1.57 percent at $364.65 after Berenberg raised its rating on the stock to  buy  from  hold . Online retailer Alibaba was up 1.8 percent at $141.6 after Raymond James raised its price target. Shopify's U.S.-listed shares were down 1.7 percent at $87.36 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the Canadian e-commerce software maker's stock to  neutral  from  buy .

You know mining well and you understand its value, but to be very frank it has been getting harder to do business here over the years - from employee relations to tax to managing land access,  Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in prepared remarks to be delivered at the International Economic Forum of the Americas in Montreal. Jacques did not elaborate on his comments. Calling it the  biggest mining and metals company in Canada,  Jacques said Rio Tinto had paid C$3.9 billion ($2.93 billion) in Canadian taxes since 2011 while investing more than C$8 billion. Rio Tinto employs around 15,000 people in Canada at more than 35 sites, including the Iron Ore Company of Canada in Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador, the Diavik diamond mine in the Northwest Territories and an aluminum smelter in British Columbia. A Quebec court ruled in 2014 that a C$900 million lawsuit by two Canadian aboriginal communities against a subsidiary of Rio Tinto can proceed. The communities in eastern Canada have said that more than 50 years of iron ore mining in the region has disrupted their traditional way of life. Jacques said that investment and growth drove wealth generation, which in turn created higher living standards. Fair trade was also key, he said.  The danger in the current climate is that we focus on wealth distribution and not wealth creation. Both are absolutely critical, but without growth we will have no wealth created to fairly distribute,  he said.

The government is trying to solve the problem. Rubber prices, like rice prices, have highs and lows,  Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting. The government will also continue to pay a direct subsidy of 1,500 baht ($44.23) per rai (0.17 hectares) for up to 15 rai per household to help to cover the costs of rubber production as well as living expenses for rubber farmers. About 11,460 families are expected to receive the subsidy in the country, which is the world's biggest producer and exporter of the commodity.

Proceeds from the Coastal Energy deal were then used to buy a property in London's glitzy Mayfair district, according to the lawsuit dated June 7. The United States is seeking to seize the London property, along with two others, the document showed. The lawsuit was filed as part of a U.S. Justice Department effort to seize about $1 billion worth of assets linked to funds it says were siphoned from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a Malaysian state fund under investigation in at least six countries for money-laundering.  The justice department filed civil lawsuits last July alleging that about $3.5 billion had been misappropriated from 1MDB and used instead to buy assets, including luxury property and artwork in the U.S. and abroad.  The latest lawsuit shows that Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, a central figure in the scandal, allegedly used 1MDB money to fund the Coastal Energy acquisition. Jho Low, as he is known, partnered with Compañía Española de Petróleos SAU (Cepsa) to buy Coastal Energy for a total purchase price of $2.2 billion. Cepsa is the Spanish unit of Abu Dhabi's state investor, International Petroleum Investment Company. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Cepsa in the acquisition, according to a news release announcing the deal in November 2013. 600 Percent Return Low invested about $50 million in the acquisition through a company called Strategic Resources (Global) Ltd, with Cespa funding the remainder of the $2.2 billion, according to the lawsuit.  Shortly afterward, Cepsa transferred $350 million to Low's Strategic Resources, buying Strategic Resources' stake in the joint venture used to buy Coastal Energy, the lawsuit says.   The commercial basis for this nearly immediate 600 percent return on investment is not immediately apparent,  the Justice Department said. Low's contribution was traceable to misappropriated proceeds of a $3 billion bond raised by Goldman for 1MDB in 2013, the lawsuit says. Goldman helped 1MDB, which was founded by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009, raise $6.5 billion in three bond sales in 2012 and 2013 to invest in energy projects and real estate to boost the Malaysian economy. Goldman was not immediately available for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Tuesday the allegations in the latest lawsuit.  Goldman told the Journal that prior to the U.S. lawsuit it was not aware, nor was it involved in, any transaction in which Strategic Resources sold its stake in a joint venture back to Cepsa. Jho Low, whose whereabouts are uncertain, could not be reached for comment. He has denied any wrongdoing in the past. IPIC, Cepsa and 1MDB did not respond to requests for comment. London Properties Proceeds from the Coastal Energy deal were used by Low to buy the Stratton Office in London for 42 million pounds ($53.15 million), according to the June 7 lawsuit. The justice department lawsuit says two other Mayfair properties -- a penthouse and a flat -- were also bought with misappropriated 1MDB funds.  Low paid 35 million pounds ($44.29 million) in 2010 for the penthouse and the flat, part of a building known as Stratton House.  The funds for those purchases were transferred from an account belonging to a company called Good Star. Low was the sole owner and beneficiary of Seycehlles-registered Good Star, a Reuters examination found. U.S. prosecutors have said more than $700 million of misappropriated funds from 1MDB flowed into the accounts of  Malaysian Official 1 , who U.S. and Malaysian officials have identified as Najib. Najib has denied any wrongdoing and was cleared of any wrongdoing by Malaysia's attorney general. ($1 = 0.7903 pounds) Nathan Layne reported from WASHINGTON; Editing by A.

Kazakhstan's central bank acquired 10-year bonds issued by the International Bank of Azerbaijan via private placement for its pension fund in 2014. But IBA's plan to restructure $3.3 billion of debt, including the chunk held by Kazakhstan, has sparked anger and led Kazakh authorities to launch an investigation into the purchase . Kazakhstan is a close political ally of Azerbaijan and the source told Reuters that representatives of the central bank had been in touch with the IBA.  Negotiations with the central bank pension fund started in May. But they will be in the plan and they will be treated as all other senior creditors ... no special treatment,  the source said.  There will be no change to the universe of creditors or the size of the debt stock to be restructured.  The notes held by the Kazakh pension fund would put it in the category of IBA creditors who are required to swap their holdings for longer-dated paper or take a writedown. But Kazakhstan is not believed to have joined any creditor group so far. IBA which has already petitioned UK and U.S. courts to support the restructuring, says it is in contact with an ad-hoc group of creditors holding over $400 million of its debt.

Proceeds from the Coastal Energy deal were then used to buy a property in London's glitzy Mayfair district, according to the lawsuit dated June 7. The United States is seeking to seize the London property, along with two others, the document showed. The lawsuit was filed as part of a U.S. Justice Department effort to seize about $1 billion worth of assets linked to funds it says were siphoned from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a Malaysian state fund under investigation in at least six countries for money-laundering.  The justice department filed civil lawsuits last July alleging that about $3.5 billion had been misappropriated from 1MDB and used instead to buy assets, including luxury property and artwork in the U.S. and abroad.  The latest lawsuit shows that Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, a central figure in the scandal, allegedly used 1MDB money to fund the Coastal Energy acquisition. Jho Low, as he is known, partnered with Compañía Española de Petróleos SAU (Cepsa) to buy Coastal Energy for a total purchase price of $2.2 billion. Cepsa is the Spanish unit of Abu Dhabi's state investor, International Petroleum Investment Company. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Cepsa in the acquisition, according to a news release announcing the deal in November 2013. 600 Percent Return Low invested about $50 million in the acquisition through a company called Strategic Resources (Global) Ltd, with Cespa funding the remainder of the $2.2 billion, according to the lawsuit.  Shortly afterward, Cepsa transferred $350 million to Low's Strategic Resources, buying Strategic Resources' stake in the joint venture used to buy Coastal Energy, the lawsuit says.   The commercial basis for this nearly immediate 600 percent return on investment is not immediately apparent,  the Justice Department said. Low's contribution was traceable to misappropriated proceeds of a $3 billion bond raised by Goldman for 1MDB in 2013, the lawsuit says. Goldman helped 1MDB, which was founded by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009, raise $6.5 billion in three bond sales in 2012 and 2013 to invest in energy projects and real estate to boost the Malaysian economy. Goldman was not immediately available for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Tuesday the allegations in the latest lawsuit.  Goldman told the Journal that prior to the U.S. lawsuit it was not aware, nor was it involved in, any transaction in which Strategic Resources sold its stake in a joint venture back to Cepsa. Jho Low, whose whereabouts are uncertain, could not be reached for comment. He has denied any wrongdoing in the past. IPIC, Cepsa and 1MDB did not respond to requests for comment. London Properties Proceeds from the Coastal Energy deal were used by Low to buy the Stratton Office in London for 42 million pounds ($53.15 million), according to the June 7 lawsuit. The justice department lawsuit says two other Mayfair properties -- a penthouse and a flat -- were also bought with misappropriated 1MDB funds.  Low paid 35 million pounds ($44.29 million) in 2010 for the penthouse and the flat, part of a building known as Stratton House.  The funds for those purchases were transferred from an account belonging to a company called Good Star. Low was the sole owner and beneficiary of Seycehlles-registered Good Star, a Reuters examination found. U.S. prosecutors have said more than $700 million of misappropriated funds from 1MDB flowed into the accounts of  Malaysian Official 1 , who U.S. and Malaysian officials have identified as Najib. Najib has denied any wrongdoing and was cleared of any wrongdoing by Malaysia's attorney general. ($1 = 0.7903 pounds) Nathan Layne reported from WASHINGTON; Editing by A.

The survey, which polled 210 asset managers with $596 billion under management, was carried out June 2-8, just ahead of a two-day rout in U.S. tech stocks led by Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet. The Nasdaq Composite ended Monday down 0.5 percent, extending Friday's 1.8 percent fall. The sell-off was triggered by reports Apple was using slower modems in upcoming iPhones compared with those in rivals' phones, and a bearish Goldman Sachs note on the mega-cap tech sector. In the BAML poll, a net 44 percent of investors said equities were overvalued, up from a net 37 percent last month, and beating the previous record high set in 1999's dotcom bubble. Being long Nasdaq was seen as the most crowded trade for the second month in a row, cited by 38 percent, up from 26 percent in May. Some 57 percent said internet stocks were  expensive , with 18 percent describing them as  bubble-like . A net 84 percent of respondents said the U.S. was the most overvalued region for equities, a new all-time high. Despite these concerns, investors raised their global tech sector allocation to a net 37 percent overweight from last month's 33 percent overweight. Their overall U.S. equity allocation rose slightly to a net 15 percent underweight from a net 17 percent underweight last month. The S&P; 500's technology sector has ballooned nearly 14 percent since President Donald Trump's inauguration in January to its most expensive since early 2008 in terms of price to earnings expectations.  Market vulnerability to profit weakness is very high, with investors' perception of excess valuation coinciding with high global profit expectations,  said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BAML. A net 47 percent of investors said global monetary policy was too stimulative, the highest since April 2011. But in contrast to the 1999 bubble, BAML detected less irrational exuberance, as cash levels rose to 5 percent from last month's 4.9 percent, remaining above the 10-year average of 4.5 percent. European and emerging market equities were viewed as undervalued by a net 18 percent and a net 48 percent respectively. However, the allocation to eurozone equities is near two-year highs at a net 58 percent overweight.  It leaves sentiment reported on Europe continuing to look very bullish, which may provide a headwind to renewed outperformance for European stocks,  said Ronan Carr, European equity strategist. European stocks are up around 7 percent year-to-date. Chinese credit tightening ranked as the top tail risk for the second straight month, chosen by 31 percent of poll participants. Eighteen percent selected a crash in global bond markets. (Editing by Ed Osmond)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/funds-baml-survey-idUSL8N1JA2JD"},

Emperor Akihito, 83, who has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer, said in rare public remarks last year he feared age might make it hard for him to continue to fulfill his duties. Japan's parliament on Friday enacted a law that will allow Akihito to step down and be succeeded by Naruhito, 57, which news reports say will take place late in 2018 or early in 2019. Akihito, the first emperor to never have been considered divine, has worked for decades at home and abroad to soothe the wounds of World War Two, fought in his father Hirohito's name - work that Naruhito, who said he had been  extremely moved  by his father's desire to step down, said he would continue.  The emperor has worked for many years, taking each task to heart extremely seriously, serving as a symbol of the people and sincerely seeking out the proper way an emperor should be,  Naruhito told a news conference ahead of a visit to Denmark. Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito speaks during a special lecture at University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia April 14, 2017.Lai Seng SinSpeaking at his palace in the heart of Tokyo, Naruhito added:  I intend to devote myself heart and soul to the duties he passes on to me.  Naruhito, a student of mediaeval transport who espouses environmental causes and has called for more men to be hands-on fathers, will be the first Japanese emperor to have received a university degree, from Tokyo's Gakushuin University. He defied palace officials to marry Masako Owada, a Harvard- and Oxford-educated diplomat. Masako, 53, has suffered from depression brought on by the stresses of palace life and demands she bear a royal heir, and her public appearances have been limited in recent years.  Naruhito said that Masako had also been invited to visit Denmark, but that due to the demands of the trip as well as duties at home, the decision was made that he would go alone.  Masako is continuing treatment and while taking care of her health is making efforts to carry out as much as possible, but she still has ups and downs in her condition so that what she can do - including foreign trips - cannot be expanded quickly,  he said.  At this point, it's difficult to judge about future foreign travel.  Reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by Robert Birsel","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-crownprince-idUSKBN1941BN"},

Central European markets were generally mixed and rangebound as investors awaited key signals on global interest rate trends from the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting on Wednesday.     The crown was trading at 26.142 against the euro at 1109 GMT, up 0.24 percent from Monday and more than 3 percent from its former cap at 27, taking it to its highest since the cap was introduced in late 2013.     Though a firming of the local currency cuts import prices, CNB data released on Tuesday showed a 14.35 billion crown ($616.01 million) current account surplus in April, against expectations for a deficit.      Some analysts expect the crown to strengthen further.     Citigroup analysts said in a note that investors should buy the crown, with a target of 25.25.     While there is some risk that inflation will be lower than expected in the coming months, a stronger crown is unlikely to deter the CNB from tightening policy by late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter, they said.     The CNB demonstrated its willingness to tighten conditions, by doubling the amount of buffer reserves that domestic banks must put aside from July 2018 because of rapid credit growth.      Elsewhere in the region, the forint gained 0.2 percent against the euro, the zloty firmed by 0.1 percent and the leu eased by 0.1 percent.     Budapest's main stock index hit a record high on Tuesday, boosted by a share price rise for OTP Bank after JP Morgan lifted its target price for the stock.     OTP firmed by about 2.5 percent to a four-month high of 9,180 forints ($33.22) after JP Morgan changed its target to 12,000 forints from 9,860 forints.      The last time we saw similar value (from JP Morgan) was in 2007,  Erste analysts said in a note.

Global conditions for unwinding crisis-fueled stimulus look fertile: the strongest economic growth in years, historically low bond yields, inflation and credit spreads, and an unrecognisably healthy banking system compared with 2008. The U.S. Federal Reserve has already raised rates three times without any notable economic or financial fallout, and the growing likelihood that it will soon start to reverse its QE stimulus hasn't destabilised the U.S. bond market. Where the Fed leads, other central banks usually follow, eventually. If central banks can't normalise policy in that benign environment, will they ever? The trouble is, conditions aren't so benign. Policymakers are rightly worried that economies and financial markets won't be able to bear the weight of higher yields, interest rates and borrowing costs that will come with  normalisation . Global debt is higher than any time in history, inflation across the Western world remains below target, and global stocks and bonds are at or near record peaks. Withdrawing stimulus, particularly the never-before-tried process of unloading trillions of dollars of bonds back onto an already overloaded debt market, carries huge financial and economic risk. And there's a lot of stimulus to withdraw. Central banks' balance sheets have ballooned by more than $10 trillion over the last decade to $15 trillion. If the Fed's tapering window is a narrow one, it's even smaller for its peers. The U.S. post-crisis economic expansion is already the third longest in history, so it probably won't be long before it rolls over and drags global growth down with it. Steen Jakobson at Saxo Bank reckons the chance of a global recession by the end of next year is as high as 60 percent. If not outright recession, the flattest U.S. yield curve since October is certainly pointing to weakening U.S. growth ahead. While global borrowing costs are near the lowest levels in history, asset prices and debt levels are at record peaks. World debt rose to more than 325 percent of global GDP last year, up $11 trillion to more than $217 trillion, according to the Institute for International Finance. Wall Street and world stocks as measured by the MSCI global index are at record highs. Some 44 percent of fund managers surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch say equities are overvalued. That's the highest response in the survey's 19-year history, even higher than the peak of the dotcom bubble. Slow Hand Recent history shows that once a central bank goes down the path of unconventional monetary policy - zero lower bound interest rates, negative rates, hoovering up financial assets - it's hard to ever fully normalise policy again. Policymakers burned by raising rates from the zero lower bound only to be forced to cut them again include the European Central Bank (twice), Reserve Bank of Australia, Bank of Canada and Bank of Japan. Comparisons with Japan are difficult to escape. It's been over two decades since the BOJ's overnight target rate was last above 0.5 percent, and 16 years since the BOJ first officially adopted QE. Yet the BOJ today has negative interest rates and is expanding its balance sheet faster than ever. The consensus view of the ECB after last week's policy meeting and updated economic projections was that it was more dovish than expected. Economists at Societe Generale now expect the ECB to extend QE bond-buying through early 2019, which would be over a decade since the financial crisis. And with political chaos and Brexit blighting the UK economic landscape, the Bank of England is years away from shrinking its balance sheet. Stephen Jen at Eurizon SLJ Macro Partners draws the analogy with martial law. When martial law is imposed in peace time, the unintended consequences and conditions it creates, like asset price bubbles, become so  perverse  it is difficult to ever be lifted. That may not be entirely fair because central banks didn't adopt unconventional policies in financial or economic peace time. But the persistence of sub-target inflation across the western world suggests that the economic peace remains elusive, despite decent headline growth. Analysts at Citi expect a combination of Fed balance sheet reduction, ECB tapering and less BOJ asset purchases will lower overall central bank net asset purchases from 4.4 percent of developed world GDP last year to 2.9 percent this year, and roughly zero in 2018.

The European Commission has backed away from forcing trading in euro derivatives to leave London. But its alternative solution will require UK-based clearing houses to follow EU rules – or lose out. European regulators have long eyed London’s grip on derivatives trading. Of the $762 billion of euro-denominated derivatives traded every day, three-quarters pass through the British capital. Clearing houses like the London Stock Exchange’s LCH.Clearnet underpin this activity by guaranteeing counterparties and managing collateral. Previously attempts by EU regulators to exert greater influence over the clearing business were blocked by the European Court of Justice. Britain’s decision to leave the bloc has given them a new incentive to act. The Commission had toyed with the idea of forcing European banks to clear euro exposures above a certain threshold with an EU-based institution. Its latest proposal is less draconian. The European Securities and Markets Authority will have oversight of clearing houses and the power to decide that a non-EU institution poses a systemic risk. In that case, European officials would have to monitor the clearing house, which would have to abide by the same rules as entities on the Continent. If it failed to comply, European banks would be forced to hold more capital against their exposures with the counterparty. Europe already has a similar arrangement with the United States. But the UK’s dominance of euro-denominated derivatives could prompt Brussels to hold London-based clearing houses to a higher standard. For example, EU regulators might insist on the right to control margin requirements for sovereign exposures. LCH.Clearnet’s decision to raise margins during the euro zone crisis in 2011 angered European authorities. The Bank of England would find it hard to hand so much control of risk management to the EU. If banks move derivatives trading out of London, that will limit their ability to offset different exposures in one place, which would push up margin requirements and trading costs. But even if banks want to stay put, they can do so only if Britain agrees to play by European rules it is no longer able to influence. For Brexit advocates who believe leaving the EU means taking back control, that would be an overdue lesson.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * Graphic on solar growth in Southeast Asia: tmsnrt.rs/2rL6l92 By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 13 (Reuters) - When it comes to electrifying Asia the conventional wisdom has been that cheap beats green, meaning coal will continue to dominate the region's new power generation as renewables such as solar and wind can't compete. However, there are increasing signs that this may not be the case any more, at least not in every country in Asia, as renewable energy sources rapidly become cheaper and achieve the utility scale needed to ensure reliable generation. The old and new paradigms were the focus at a high-level, invitation-only forum in Singapore last week, organised by the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC). The representatives of the coal industry, as well as some respected industry analysts, presented a fairly bullish outlook for the period up to 2030, pointing to a strong pipeline of projects in both traditional coal buyers such as Japan, China and India, as well as new entrants such as Vietnam and the Philippines. On the other side, energy and climate academics and representatives of think tanks pointed to the increasing cost-competitiveness of renewable power, mounting political and community pressure for cleaner energy and the potential disruptive influence of newer technologies such as battery storage. Overall, the message from the coal industry was that they are still the cheapest, will be for some time and are therefore not going anywhere. The word from the academics and energy policy specialists was that the coal industry is too comfortable and is largely unaware that it is actually now in an existential fight, and the forces arrayed against it are motivated and increasingly effective. President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris agreement on limiting carbon pollution hasn't been replicated across Asia, with top emitters China and India pledging to meet their commitments under the deal. It's also becoming clearer that the forces pushing for increased use of renewables are moving to target countries planning to boost the use of coal. The tactics are varied and include lobbying governments and industry, trying to restrict financing for coal-fired plants, public awareness campaigns and grassroots activism. Up to now the efforts of the environmental lobby have largely been focused on developed countries, but they are now switching targets to include nations like Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia, all of which are planning new coal generation. Rapid advances in technology, such as battery storage, can also disrupt coal's advance in Asia, and this is likely to be a factor when banks, utilities and governments are deciding whether to spend billions of dollars on a new coal-fired plant that has a lifespan of at least 25 years. Coal Storm Clouds Gather The evidence seems to be that while coal use in Asia is likely to rise in coming years as plants already under construction are commissioned, the longer-term outlook is becoming far less clear. The amount of coal-fired generation capacity that started construction around the world in 2016 was 63.06 gigawatts (GW), 62 percent lower that in 2015, according to a March paper by environmental groups Coalswarm, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace. The paper also identified a 164 percent jump in the amount of coal-fired capacity put on hold in 2016 from the prior year, although the actual amount of coal capacity operating globally actually rose 3 percent to 1,964 GW. Breaking the data down by countries in Asia showed that China has 145.5 GW under construction, but 441.7 GW on hold, while India has 48.2 GW being built and 82.5 GW on hold. Among emerging coal importers, Vietnam had 15.2 GW under construction and 2.8 GW on hold, Malaysia had 3.6 GW being built and the Philippines had 4.5 GW under construction and 0.9 GW on hold. The coal industry would point to the fact that as of January this year some 272.9 GW of coal power is being built, while the environmental lobby may fire back that 607.4 GW is on hold. One of the coal miners present at the KAPSARC forum said that his company was fielding numerous inquiries from utilities across South East Asia trying to lock in long-term supply deals for newly-built coal-fired plants. But the miners also did express some caution about the outlook for seaborne imports to China and India, the world's two biggest importers. China is trying to limit coal use in order to improve air quality in major cities and India's government has stated that it wants coal imports to drop to zero. While India's aim of zero imports is fanciful, it's possible that it could drop down to a figure closer to 100 million tonnes a year, which would be sufficient to meet its needs for coking coal used to make steel, as well as thermal coal for coastal power plants that were designed to run on imported fuel. This would be a drop of more than 100 million tonnes from the record 206 million India imported in 2015, and well below the 194.6 million last year. A drop of such magnitude would likely outweigh any potential increase in seaborne imports by newer consumers in South East Asia. The future of India's demand for imported coal is far from certain, but the trend seems to be clearer, and that's for lower imports. India's ambitious targets for renewable energy may also crimp its need for more coal-fired power plants in coming years, and the record low prices achieved at recent market auctions for solar power supply show that coal has a fight on its hands. Coal-fired power is still about half the price of liquefied natural gas in most Asian markets, meaning a U.S.-style natural gas revolution is unlikely in power generation. But the rapid rise of renewables, coupled with an increasing focus on cleaner energy means that many Asian countries are likely to face a choice they haven't had before. They can now be cheap and green, whereas before they could either be cheap or green. Editing by Richard Pullin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/column-russell-coal-asia-idUSL3N1JA27E"},

Terms of the original decree, being discussed by lawmakers, set administrative, not criminal punishment, of banks and other financial firms involved in corruption. An amendment could be in response to calls from Brazilian prosecutors who have criticized the content of the decree, Valor reported. Including prosecutors in bank plea deals would be a key step toward enhancing the framework that would empower the central bank and capital markets regulator CVM and improve transparency, Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said last week. Neither the central bank nor the CVM had an immediate comment. The decree raises fines for banks to as much as 2 billion reais ($603 million) from 250,000 reais currently. It also allows the central bank to strike plea bargain agreements with financial firms that admit breaching the law in exchange for softer fines or more lenient prison terms for their executives. President Michel Temer's administration sped up preparation of the decree because of the risk of new disclosures snaring Brazilian banks in a vast corruption scandal, Reuters reported on June 8, citing government sources. The decree was announced as Congress launches an investigation into the stock and currency trades of JBS SA and news of plea-bargain testimony from its owners surfaced. JBS, which is controlled by the billionaire Batista family, is the world's No. 1 meatpacker.

Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said late on Monday that first-quarter growth in the North American country had been  pretty impressive , and that signs economic growth was broadening would lead the central bank to consider whether current low rates would still be required. The comments sent the Canadian dollar - or the  loonie  as it is known by traders - to its highest level since April 13, with the currency gaining around 1.5 percent late on Monday and early on Tuesday to hit C$1.3245 against its U.S. counterpart . While many economists had expected the bank to start raising in 2018, markets were pricing in a 52 percent chance of a hike by the end of 2017 following Wilkins's speech.  The market had been overlooking the strengthening economic data from Canada, and obviously now that we’re starting to see some change in communication from the Bank of Canada to acknowledge that ... the market won’t be able to look through that,  said MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman, in London.  The shift to a more hawkish stance will offer the potential for the Canadian dollar to strengthen further from here.  The loonie's U.S. counterpart, meanwhile, inched down against a basket of currencies ahead of the start of the Fed's meeting, as the euro inched higher, staying just above $1.12. With the Fed widely expected to raise interest rates when it concludes its meeting on Wednesday, investors' focus will be on any fresh hints on the pace of hikes in the months to come, and its assessment of the economy and outlook on inflation. Investors will also be watching for any fresh details on the central bank's plans for trimming its balance sheet.  The Fed is likely to remain cautious as recent mixed data should lead FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) members to revise down their projections for both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate,  said Credit Agricole macro strategist Xavier Chapard, in Paris.  We expect the 'dot plot' to remain unchanged, pointing to one additional rate hike this year and three hikes next year.  Sterling rebounded from seven-month lows plumbed the previous day against the euro and gained 0.6 percent against the dollar, after data showed British inflation unexpectedly jumped to its highest level in nearly four years in May. Investors were still cautious, though, viewing the pound as vulnerable to political uncertainty after the shock outcome of last week's election, in which voters denied any party a parliamentary majority.

The agency was commenting in reaction to remarks made by Qatar Airways' chief executive that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were violating international law by shutting out Qatari flights. The airspace closure was to protect the country and its citizens from anything it sees as a threat and as a precautionary measure, Saudi Arabia's General Authority of Civil Aviation said in a statement published by the Saudi Press Agency. Similar statements were also issued by the UAE and Bahraini aviation authorities after Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker criticised the three Arab countries for the airspace closure in an interview with CNN. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar have long been major proponents of open-skies air transport agreements which remove restrictions on flying between states. These policies helped the region's largest airlines -- Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways to develop their home airports as hubs linking passengers travelling between the east and west.  From an industry viewpoint it's unfortunate and disappointing when airlines get caught up in broader political sensitivities which inhibit the benefits of competition and consumer choice, which the region is renowned for,  independent aviation consultant John Strickland told Reuters. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar a week ago, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies. In all 18 destinations in the region are now out of bounds for Qatar Airways, which has also been forced to close its offices in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Qatar Airways will now use the aircraft that had been operated on those 18 destinations to fast track its expansion plans, al-Baker later told Al Jazeera in an interview on June 13. Al-Baker, warning that the blocking of airspace would also hurt competitors by undermining confidence in the region's  air connectivity , did not say which markets it would expand to. Meanwhile al-Baker has appealed to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency which regulates international air travel under the Chicago Convention, to declare the airspace closure as illegal. The UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority said it was fully committed to the Chicago Convention but reserved the sovereign right under international law to take any precautionary measures to protect its national security if necessary, UAE state news agency WAM said. The three countries' aviation authorities also said that non-Qatari private and chartered flights from Qatar must submit requests to them at least 24 hours before crossing the airspace. The request should include a list of names and nationalities of crews and passengers, as well as the cargo carried by the aircraft, they said.

The Treasury Department on Monday released a long list of suggested changes to banking rules, and said most of them could be carried out by agencies now, or soon to be, headed by Trump appointees. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law gave those agencies great leeway in how to interpret the rules. The only speed bump is the lack of appointees in place. Just one of Trump's financial regulatory nominees has been approved by Congress, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Jay Clayton. Other agencies are operating under  acting  chiefs or have leaders appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Here are some of the changes suggested in Monday's report that could be done without Congress.

He heads to the cowshed to join his wife and two daughters, raking manure into big mounds. Using dry twigs as brooms, they are sweeping the green-layered droppings into a fifth pile when they’re interrupted by a loud hooting. Sankare beams excitedly and heads for the gate - his family is about to reap $150 for their labor.  “Prolonged drought is making it hard to find pasture and food,” he explained, estimating a third of his cattle have starved this year. “Selling manure helps me buy food and pay hospital bills for my family.” Demand for manure collected from Kenya's rangelands for use as fertilizer is on the rise.  Scientists at the Nairobi-based International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) say this manure is richer in nitrogen and phosphorous than that from enclosed livestock which do not graze. Crops need nitrogen to develop vegetation, while phosphorous is essential for root formation and the crop’s structure, said Edward Karanja, project leader with ICIPE, which is working to promote the use of manure as fertilizer in Kenya. In Sankare’s village, growing crops is not part of the Maasai community’s traditional sources of income, meaning the potential of their livestock's manure has been overlooked. But that is starting to change. On Mary Wanjiru’s farm in Kangari village in central Kenya, leafy rows of maize, beans and other vegetables promise a generous harvest, even in a season when farmers all over Kenya are expecting poor yields due to insufficient rains. Wanjiru has been farming her one-eighth of an acre using both manure collected from Maasai land and composted manure from her own cow penned on a corner of her land. On the lower strip, where she has applied her composted manure, knee-high maize and beans fight for space to grow.  On the upper strip, where she has used manure from Maasai grazing land, the beans are ankle-high and already putting out tendrils to climb up stakes set in the ground.  “I use only manure on my farm,” said the mother of seven, who is certain she will get a bumper harvest. But finding enough good-quality fertilizer is becoming “a challenge”, she noted. Much of this highland area has been planted with cash crops such as tea, crowding out staple crops, she said. Even keeping livestock is getting tougher due to a lack of fodder for cows and goats, she added. Tea Leaves But for enterprising herders like Sankare, the manure trade offers a new source of income that is helping compensate for losses caused by drought. Sankare estimates he can collect about eight tonnes of manure over a month. That is enough to fertilize 1.5 acres (0.6 hectares) of tea plantation in central Kenya, said James Njuguna, a farmers' field assistant working in the area.   “When manure from Maasai land is applied on the tea farms, the production is higher than expected,” said Njuguna. A tea plant normally yields about 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) of leaves a year, but when enriched with manure, it can produce as much as 3 kg. Kenya’s growing appetite for rangeland manure is creating a new revenue stream – and not just for herders.  David Ngure, a trader in central Kenya, has been selling Maasai manure to farmers for the last two years. In a week, he can supply an average of five truck-loads of 8 tonnes each, which he sells for 36,000 Kenyan shillings (about $348) per load. “Demand for the product among crop farmers is high,” said Ngure. But supplying the orders is a logistical challenge because he must travel as far as 400 km (248.5 miles) to source the manure from pastoralists like Sankare. ICIPE’s Karanja sees big potential in the manure trade because more Kenyans are investing in agriculture. About 80 percent of Kenya is arid and semi-arid land, making pastoralism the main economic activity in those parts. But the government has not done enough to help herders exploit manure as a resource, said Karanja. For instance, they should be encouraged to form co-operatives to make it easier to manage income from selling manure, and save money to buy food when drought hits, he said. There are also environmental benefits, he noted. “Using manure for farming helps store carbon in the soil and prevents it from being released into the atmosphere,” said Karanja. In this way, communities can contribute to reducing climate-changing emissions, he added. Reporting by Kagondu Njagi; editing by Megan Rowling.

The changes will partially reverse job cuts in the tax inspectorate made over a decade and will see the current tax authority SKAT replaced with seven regionally-based agencies, Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said.  Enough is enough. We have to restore the Danish citizens' trust in the tax system. That trust is the foundation for our welfare state,  Rasmussen told a news conference. Denmark estimates 12.3 billion Danish crowns ($1.85 billion) were lost to tax fraud between 2012 and 2015. Danish citizens carry the highest tax burden in the world, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, with the total tax take amounting to 47 percent of gross domestic product. Rasmussen said the overhaul would include 1,000 new positions. The government has cut 4,000 jobs in the tax inspectorate since 2006 as part of money-saving measures. Copenhagen-based SKAT was created in 2005. Denmark said last year that it would spend more than $1 billion to upgrade its tax inspection system. It also paid some $900,000 for access to Panama Papers documents in an effort to identify hundreds of suspected Danish tax cheats. In an effort to recoup money paid out in the form of fraudulent tax refunds to people outside the country, Danish authorities have also carried out raids in Britain and elsewhere.

According to Valor, which did not specify how it got the information, Chile's Parque Arauco SA has hired Banco Santander SA to work on a proposal, while Morgan Stanley & Co is advising Fibria, the world's No. 1 eucalyptus pulpmaker. Another potential contender is Suzano Papel & Celulose SA , which is said to have hired two unidentified large Brazilian investment banks to analyze a bid, Valor said. Two bankers told Valor under condition of anonymity that Eldorado's equity could be worth between 3 billion reais and 4 billion reais ($904 million and $1.2 billion). With debt hovering at 8 billion reais, Eldorado could soon be put up for sale after two key members of Brazil's Batista family were ensnared in a corruption scandal, sources have told Reuters in recent weeks. Eldorado lenders are pressing for a sale of the company, Valor noted. J&F; Investimentos SA, the company overseeing the business of the Batistas, has 81 percent of Eldorado. The remaining 19 percent is owned by Brazilian pension funds, Petros Fundação and Funcef Fundação dos Economiarios, and special purpose vehicle FIP Olímpia. There were no immediate comments by São Paulo-based J&F;, Fibria, Suzano or the banks. The media office of Santiago-based Arauco did not answer early calls seeking comment. Last October, J&F; started talks to buy out the stakes that both Petros and Funcef have in Eldorado. Both Joesley and Wesley Batista, the family members that last month entered the plea deal with Brazilian prosecutors, want to speak to bidders of Eldorado first before hiring an advisor for a sale, Valor said, citing banking executives with knowledge of the matter. Fibria seems the most unlikely suitor because a key shareholder, state development bank BNDES, is unlikely to approve a transaction that could shore up the Batistas, Valor said, without saying how it got the information. In their plea bargain, both Batistas ensnared President Michel Temer in a corruption scandal, unleashing retaliatory actions from his government against the group. $1 = 3.3176 reais Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Editing by Bernadette Baum","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eldorado-brasil-ma-idUSL1N1JA0CM"},

The government recently launched a long-delayed process to sell 2,000 acres (800 hectares) of unused land belonging to unprofitable state-owned enterprises - known in India as public sector undertakings (PSUs). The railways, ports, aviation and defense ministries also hold vast tracts of surplus land. A portion of this land held by the government must be given to states to build housing for poor and low-income groups to meet India's goal of Housing for All by 2022, experts and activists said.  The government says finding land is the biggest problem for affordable housing, but the government is sitting on so much land that is lying idle,  said Shivani Chaudhry, executive director at New Delhi-based advocacy group Housing and Land Rights Network.  PSUs could easily work with the ministry of housing to see how best to address this issue, but they would rather monetize the land in other ways.  India's state-owned enterprises hold more than 1 million acres of surplus land, according to some estimates. Government enterprises themselves are unsure how much land they have, said Samar Lahiry, a former adviser to the government's planning commission.  India has sufficient land for all uses, including housing, if we use our existing resources with prudence,  Lahiry said.  We need to evaluate land use and take stock of land that is locked up with PSUs. Using idle land for vital civic infrastructure such as hospitals, roads and affordable housing is important, given the contentious nature of land acquisition.  Some of these surplus government-held lands have been encroached upon by the urban poor struggling with a lack of affordable housing. Government committees over the years have failed to sell off these lands because of a lack of clear guidelines, inadequate records and a lack of coordination between various ministries. A spokesman for the ministry of housing said plans to create a land bank are on track.  The government has asked PSUs how much unused land they have. Once there is a clear idea of how much land there is, the government will draw up a plan for its use,  A. A. Rao told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Affordable housing will be a priority.  A quarter of India's urban population lives in informal housing such as slums, according to social consultancy FSG. That number is set to rise as tens of thousands of people leave their villages to seek better prospects in cities. The government's Housing for All plan aims to create 20 million new urban housing units and 30 million rural homes. Availability of land to meet this goal is a challenge. Conflicts over land have risen as demand grows for industrial and infrastructure projects to drive growth and boost development for India's 1.3 billion citizens. Earlier this year, India's Supreme Court asked seven states why land bought for special economic zones is lying idle, after an advocacy group said about 80 percent of such land is unused.

I could not play last year because of injury so I look forward to returning in November.  Nadal has never won the event, but finished runner-up in 2010 and 2013, losing out to Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, respectively. The ATP World Tour Finals, which features the world's top eight singles players and top eight doubles pairs, will be held at London's O2 Arena from Nov. 12-19. Federer is next in line to qualify for the event, for which he is a near certainty after winning the Australian Open earlier this year. The Swiss will return to action in Stuttgart this week after sitting out the entire claycourt season to prepare for Wimbledon. Young Austrian Dominic Thiem is third in the ATP race to London, followed by Stan Wawrinka, Alexander Zverev, Djokovic, world number one Andy Murray, and Belgium's David Goffin. Players earn their place at the season finale by finishing in the top eight of the race to London standings on Nov. 6, when the World Tour regular season concludes after the Paris Masters. The race is a calendar-year points race that starts at the beginning of each season in the first week of January.

Szabolcs Takacs, state secretary for EU Affairs in Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Office, said that Brussels should instead strive to strengthen cooperation among member states in individual areas. The EU should also speed up access talks with Serbia and Montenegro to prevent a destabilisation of the western Balkans, Takacs added.  A two-speed Europe I think is simply not viable because it might mean such a deep division that eventually it would be ... the end of the EU in its present form,  Takacs told Reuters in an interview.   We can set up a kind of matrix of different (areas of) strengthened cooperation with the overarching goal and principle being competitiveness.  The European prosecutor's office, which Hungary along with some other states had opted not to join, was a good example of the way to go, Takacs said. Central European member states have voiced concerns over the  idea of  multi-speed  Europe, which is gaining growing support in Germany, France and other EU countries following Britain's vote to leave the bloc.  Poland and Hungary with their nationalist-minded governments both want to curb the power of Brussels institutions and preserve national sovereignty in more areas. Prague has also said there should be no splitting of Europe into two groups of countries with different integration levels, while Slovakia -- which is a member of the euro zone -- said it supported closer integration. Takacs said central Europe with its solid economic growth and fiscal discipline, presented  added value  to the EU.  They might not like our position on relocation (quotas) but let's try and not to talk about only relocation,  he said, referring to legal cases which the EU's executive may open against three eastern members for failing to take in asylum-seekers. Takacs also said the EU should speed up accession talks with Serbia and Montenegro.  If you don't stabilize the western Balkans then somebody else will stabilize it. Or rather destabilize it,  he said.  It is not Russia only, if you look at the region you can see many other players there: Turkey, Saudi-Arabia, Qatar, China ... there are many countries which are trying to exercise more influence,  he said.

So far 225,000 tonnes have arrived in total, this is through deals with six local trading firms and all of the wheat is Russian,  a government source told Reuters on Tuesday. Syria's General Establishment for Cereal Processing and Trade (Hoboob) signed contracts with local traders for 1.2 million tonnes of Russian wheat in February in what was the country's second attempt at a huge grain deal since October. Hoboob imports wheat for the country's bread programme. Flat bread is a subsidised staple for Syrians, who have suffered under a conflict estimated to have killed several hundred thousand people and forced millions to flee their homes. Hoboob had struck a deal in October to buy one million tonnes of wheat from its ally Russia to feed government held areas and prevent bread shortages after a sharp drop in the country's wheat production last season. The October deal, struck with a little known firm called Zernomir, has so far not been fulfilled.  That deal is still on hold, there were several hurdles. We don't know whether it will be executed or not,  the source said. Syria has also just started its local wheat buying season. It has so far procured only around 32,000 tonnes of wheat but the buying season will go on until August. The Syrian government has said it expects the country to produce 2.17 million tonnes of local wheat in the 2017 season. That figure would suggest an increase of nearly one million tonnes on 2016. Syria's wheat harvest fell by almost half to 1.3 million tonnes last year, its lowest in 27 years, as fighting and poor rainfall further degraded the farming sector and the nation's ability to feed itself.

The regime’s nuclear weapons program is a clear and present danger to all, and the regime’s provocative actions, manifestly illegal under international law, have not abated despite United Nations’ censure and sanctions,  Mattis said in a written statement to the House Armed Services Committee.  The most urgent and dangerous threat to peace and security is North Korea,  the statement added.  North Korea's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them has increased in pace and scope.  Related CoverageU.S.'s Shannon: North Korea could become global threatEarlier this month, the U.N. Security Council expanded targeted sanctions against North Korea after its repeated missile tests, adopting the first such resolution agreed by the United States and China since President Donald Trump took office.  The U.S. focus on North Korea has been sharpened by dozens of North Korean missile launches and two nuclear bomb tests since the beginning of last year and by Pyongyang's vow to develop a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. Mattis, speaking before the panel, warned of the potential losses in the case of conflict with North Korea.   It would be a war like nothing we have seen since 1953 and we would have to deal with it with whatever level of force was necessary ... It would be a very, very serious war,  Mattis said. The Korean War ended in 1953, three years after fighting began in a conflict that would kill 140,000 South Koreans, 36,000 U.S. soldiers and 1 million civilians.  South Korea's top national security adviser said last week that Seoul did not aim to change its agreement on the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system to protect against North Korea, despite a decision to delay its full installation. Chung Eui-yong called the decision to delay installation of remaining launchers of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, system, pending a review of its environmental impact, a domestic measure to ensure a democratic process.

U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers gather in Washington for their two-day meeting against the backdrop of a slide in tech stocks that served as a reminder of how tighter financial conditions may hurt sectors where valuations appear stretched. That sell-off was seen petering out on Tuesday as Wall Street looked set to rebound with Asian and European stocks. But it was just one vulnerability that also spread across currency and debt markets in the likes of Canada and China, where investors see the Fed as a guide for their monetary policy. The Canadian dollar hit a two-month high after a policymaker said the central bank would assess if it needs to keep rates at near-record lows as the economy grows, while the prospect of China raising short-term rates has come as its yield curve inverts in a worrying sign for growth. The gap between benchmark U.S and European bond yields held near its widest in a month as the Fed meeting also shone a light on the slow pace of change in European Central Bank policy.  If the Fed is tightening policy and embarking on a gradual normalisation path, whether it is the short-term policy rates or the balance sheet, it wants the market to believe it and to adjust to it,  said Frederik Ducrozet, an economist at Pictet Wealth Management.  It is not just about complacency and the creation of financial bubbles ... but also about its own credibility.  The Fed is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate in a decision scheduled for Wednesday and may also provide more details on its plans to shrink $4.5 trillion dollars of assets it amassed to nurse the economic recovery. The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England also meet this week, although no major policy changes are expected. Stocks Rebound Futures showed Wall Street opening 0.2 percent higher , steadying after tech stocks notched up losses of over 3.5 percent in the past two sessions. That has been driven by tech giants Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft. European stocks rebounded from seven-week lows in early deals as shares in tech firms recovered and financials rose. The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.6 percent, partly recovering losses from the previous sessions. Technology was the top sectoral gainer, up 1.1 percent after posting a 3.6 percent loss on Monday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan also rose 0.6 percent, recouping about half of the previous day's losses. The MSCI Asia Pacific Information Technology index steadied, after sliding 1.4 percent on Monday. Some analysts had predicted Asian tech shares would not see as intense a sell-off as their U.S. peers, as their valuations were less stretched.  Comparatively, valuations for the IT sector in the Asia Pacific region are less expensive compared to the U.S., which may be why we're not seeing the situation further aggravate for a second session,  said Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG in Singapore. For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets A small majority of traders in China's financial markets think its central bank will raise short-term interest rates again this week if the Fed hikes its key policy rate, according to a Reuters poll. But the reaction to this in bond markets has been concerning. China's two-year yields have in the last few sessions risen above its 10-year yields -- a trend that has only happened in a few instances over the past decade, and which suggests investors have worries over the long-term health of the world's second-biggest economy. Canadian Surprise In currencies, the Canadian dollar strengthened about 0.6 percent to trade at C$1.325, after gaining 1.1 percent on Monday. Monday's comments from a Bank of Canada official was a change in tone for the central bank, which said earlier this year that rate cuts remain on the table.  It feels like a long time since markets have been treated to unscheduled hints of tightening, and this was quite apparent when you saw the positive reaction of CAD crosses overnight,  Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at ThinkMarkets in Melbourne, wrote in a note. Against a broad basked of trade-weighted peers, the U.S. dollar was a touch weaker. Sterling regained around 0.5 percent against the dollar, having fallen almost 3 percent since the first hint of Britain's election result on Thursday night. The recovery has been helped by hopes domestic politics may be inching towards a  softer  and less economically damaging Brexit. Above-forecast UK inflation data on Tuesday further complicates an outlook that shows the economy slowing but prices rising much faster than the Bank of England's 2 percent target. In commodities, oil advanced on news that Saudi Arabia would make supply cuts to customers. Brent crude futures were at $48.64 per barrel at 0833 GMT, up 35 cents, while benchmark U.S. crude was at $46.38 per barrel, up 30 cents.

The move comes as a bill allowing the central bank to make lenders cap loans, if needed, is at risk of failing in parliament, drawing sharp criticism from the bank's Governor Jiri Rusnok on Tuesday. Czech lending growth is close to the fastest since 2009 as record low interest rates spur demand, especially in housing, where low supply and cheap mortgages have driven up prices on new apartments in Prague by a fifth in the past year. Economists and real estate experts have yet to call it a bubble but, seeking to get ahead of problems, the central bank has taken steps such as giving banks recommendations to limit mortgage sizes - for which it now wants legal power to enforce. The bank has also set a countercyclical  bad times  buffer rate on banks of 0.5 percent valid from this year which will double to 1.0 percent from July 2018. The bank said it stood ready to increase the rate or cut it, depending on developments.  We are a country where property prices are probably rising the fastest in the whole European Union, so risk features are clearly present on the horizon,  Rusnok told reporters.  That is why we are trying to react and approach this reasonably.  He added the bank would have decided to raise the buffer rate regardless of the state of the draft law in parliament. Czech banks made it through the global financial crisis almost a decade ago relatively unscathed and remain highly capitalized but some have cut back dividends in reaction to higher capital requirements. The biggest banks in the country are CSOB, owned by Belgium's KBC, Ceska Sporitelna, owned by Austria's Erste Group Bank, and Komercni Banka, owned by France's Societe Generale. Prague-listed shares of Komercni Banka and Moneta Money Bank were little changed on Tuesday. Lending strength has been helped by strong economic growth and the lowest unemployment in the European Union, boosting wages. But rising house prices, especially in Prague, are beginning to exclude some from the market. The draft bill would allow the central bank to cap loans according to debt-to-income, debt-servicing-to-income and loan-to-value ratios. Opponents say it will shut young couples and families out of the market. Since April, the bank has recommended banks provide mortgages that should not exceed 90 percent of property values. In its annual financial stability report, the central bank said the banking sector remained resilient to potential shocks and would maintain solid capital adequacy even in a  very unlikely  adverse scenario projected by stress tests.

The service, called  NBC Left Field,  is producing short  documentaries and features for Alphabet Inc's YouTube, Facebook and Instagram with the intention of eventually running ads.  News organizations like NBC News are under pressure to find  ways to draw younger viewers who are increasingly turning to YouTube and Facebook instead of television. Only 8 percent of viewers of national broadcast television news in 2016 were in the 18-34 age bracket, according to Nielsen.  It’s my belief that broadcasters need to begin viewing these hubs as digital cities,  said Matt Danzico, head of NBC Left Field.  So in the same way that it’s clearly important NBC have local bureaus to serve news and information for, about and within the actual cities their audiences live, it’s now imperative that we exist within these digital municipalities.  Left Field has hired 10 full-time journalists with broad  backgrounds, such as a former photographer and cinematographer who worked in the Middle East and a fiction writer. They will work from an office in downtown New York, away from the  headquarters. While initially the videos will not have ads, NBC News is looking at different formats for advertising, including branded content, said Nick Ascheim, head of digital at NBC News.  Left Field will have an international focus with the aim of attracting a global audience. For example, one of its first segments is about asylum squatters in Amsterdam. Another video is about a Swedish museum of failed gadgets. NBC News is not the first news outlet to launch a digital video service. In 2015, CNN launched  Great Big Story,  which  has 128 million multi-platform video views every month, according to CNN. The average viewer is 28. Unlike TV, where NBC News competes with other  broadcasters, Left Field will go head-to-head with all news organizations on social media, which include newspapers, start-ups and cable networks.   NBC recognizes that news organizations need to innovate and experiment and it's very hard to do inside their traditional formats,  said Andrew Heyward, the former head of CBS News and  a visiting researcher at MIT Media Lab.  The challenge is to figure out ways to create distinctive value.  Reporting by Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Dan Grebler","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nbc-news-digital-idUSKBN1941BJ"},

After falling to .500 for the first time this season with their 21st loss in 31 road games, the Orioles look to take steps to right the ship on Tuesday in the second contest of their four-game series against the host Chicago White Sox. While Baltimore doesn't have much for which to crow, Trey Mancini continued his hot streak against Chicago by belting a three-run homer in Monday's 10-7 setback. The 25-year-old is 7-for-11 with two homers and seven RBIs versus the White Sox this season but will get his first look at Derek Holland on Tuesday. While Baltimore is plummeting, American League Central cellar-dwelling Chicago isn't faring much better with just three wins in its last 12 contests.

TV: 8:10 p.m. ET, MASN2 (Baltimore), CSN Chicago PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Alec Asher (2-4, 4.35 ERA) vs. White Sox LH Derek Holland (4-6, 3.99) Asher has struggled mightily since rejoining Baltimore's rotation on May 28, allowing 13 earned runs over 12 1/3 innings in his last three starts. The 25-year-old was blitzed for five runs and seven hits in four frames of a 6-1 setback at Washington on Thursday, with four walks and a 41-pitch first inning driving up his pitch count. Asher pitched much better in his previous outing against the White Sox on May 7, scattering five hits over 3 1/3 scoreless innings. Holland saw his losing streak extend to three games on Wednesday, and his penchant for surrendering homers played a significant role in that. The 30-year-old was taken deep three times for the second straight outing as he yielded six runs in 4 2/3 innings of a 7-5 setback at Tampa Bay. Holland, who has allowed 11 homers in his last six trips to the mound, also has issued 17 walks in that span. Walk-Offs 1. Baltimore 1B Chris Davis' availability for Tuesday's tilt is in question after he exited the opener in the third inning with a strained right oblique muscle. 2. Chicago LF Melky Cabrera has recorded three-hit performances in two of his last three games and multi-hit efforts in five of his last eight. 3. Orioles 2B Jonathan Schoop is 11-for-30 with three homers, eight RBIs and seven runs scored in his last eight games.

Both teams are trying to find the heights that took them to a meeting in the 2014 World Series but are struggling in the standings as the Royals get set to visit the Giants for the start of a two-game interleague series on Tuesday. Kansas City, which lost to San Francisco in seven games in the 2014 World Series before going back and winning the Fall Classic over the New York Mets the following season, sits in fourth place in the American League Central and is last in the AL in runs scored (237). The Royals have begun to break out of their team-wide offensive funk in June by scoring at least seven runs in five wins during a 6-4 start to the month, including a four-game split with the major league-best Houston Astros.

Vargas, who missed the 2015 World Series due to an arm injury, struck out nine in seven scoreless frames against the Giants at home on April 19. Blach had a string of four straight wins come to an end when he was knocked around for five runs on nine hits in six innings at Milwaukee on Wednesday. The 26-year-old had a string of five straight starts of at least seven innings and three or fewer runs allowed come to an end in that contest. Blach's lone previous interleague experience was a stint out of the bullpen at Kansas City on April 18, when he worked two-thirds of an inning scoreless. Walk-Offs 1.

The 23-year-old limited the Chicago White Sox to one run on three hits and two walks over 6 1/3 innings with five strikeouts in a 3-1 victory last week. Faria, a former 10th-round draft pick, is 6-1 with a 3.07 ERA and 84 strikeouts in 58 2/3 innings at Durham in 2017. Estrada entered June at 4-2 with a 3.15 ERA, but he's been knocked around for 11 runs and 16 hits in 9 1/3 innings over his first two starts this month. Included in that stretch is a rocky performance (seven runs in 3 2/3 innings) against the New York Yankees in his most recent home outing.

By Catherine Ngai and Swetha Gopinath June 13 (Reuters) - Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply. The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said. However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC's efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness. The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel, barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply. For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months. Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production. According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower. In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all. (GRAPHIC: tmsnrt.rs/2rolpok) Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.  A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,  said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets. Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said. Underhedged Anxieties Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output. The increases were driven by Hess Corp and Apache Corp, which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels. Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.  I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,  said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group. Some New Players In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels. Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges. Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.  Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,  said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

The service, called  NBC Left Field,  is producing short  documentaries and features for Alphabet Inc's YouTube, Facebook and Instagram with the intention of eventually running ads.  News organizations like NBC News are under pressure to find  ways to draw younger viewers who are increasingly turning to YouTube and Facebook instead of television. Only 8 percent of viewers of national broadcast television news in 2016 were in the 18-34 age bracket, according to Nielsen.  It’s my belief that broadcasters need to begin viewing these hubs as digital cities,  said Matt Danzico, head of NBC Left Field.  So in the same way that it’s clearly important NBC have local bureaus to serve news and information for, about and within the actual cities their audiences live, it’s now imperative that we exist within these digital municipalities.  Left Field has hired 10 full-time journalists with broad  backgrounds, such as a former photographer and cinematographer who worked in the Middle East and a fiction writer. They will work from an office in downtown New York, away from the  headquarters. While initially the videos will not have ads, NBC News is looking at different formats for advertising, including branded content, said Nick Ascheim, head of digital at NBC News.  Left Field will have an international focus with the aim of attracting a global audience. For example, one of its first segments is about asylum squatters in Amsterdam. Another video is about a Swedish museum of failed gadgets. NBC News is not the first news outlet to launch a digital video service. In 2015, CNN launched  Great Big Story,  which  has 128 million multi-platform video views every month, according to CNN. The average viewer is 28. Unlike TV, where NBC News competes with other  broadcasters, Left Field will go head-to-head with all news organizations on social media, which include newspapers, start-ups and cable networks.   NBC recognizes that news organizations need to innovate and experiment and it's very hard to do inside their traditional formats,  said Andrew Heyward, the former head of CBS News and  a visiting researcher at MIT Media Lab.

The 347-year-old company, also known as HBC, announced job cuts across North America on Thursday. It is the latest department store chain to unveil plans to try to address industry-wide turmoil amid intense competition in a saturated market. HBC's real estate portfolio includes its Saks Fifth Avenue flagship in New York, valued at $3.7 billion in 2014, and its Lord & Taylor flagship, valued at $655 million in 2016. It also has two joint ventures worth about C$6.1 billion ($4.6 billion)and C$2 billion. At the time these ventures were formed, Chairman Richard Baker said the company might consider an initial public offer at some point for the joint ventures. Joshua Varghese, a portfolio manager with CI Investment, said HBC's properties are considered higher-quality than those of some competitors and that there is strong private-market demand for good real estate. He said this suggests the company could bring in another partner for its joint ventures as one option.  I think there will be more pressure to extract value from the real estate,  said Varghese, whose firm is one of the retailer's largest investors, with a stake of nearly 4.2 percent.  I'm not sure just yet if IPO-ing at this time is the best way to do that.  Baker gave HBC's strongest signal in April about monetizing real estate assets and reiterated the possibility in a call with analysts on Friday, but conceded the timing for an IPO was tougher than six months ago. Industry analysts and consultants question the market appetite for retail real estate assets in a rising interest-rate environment and as more retailers close stores.  The company had a short window to sell the real estate ... But I think that barn door is closed,  said Barry Schwartz, vice president and portfolio manager at Baskin Financial Services. Without other tenants, and with retail sales being weak, any spinoffs of assets would be  done at fire sale prices,  Schwartz said. HBC is shedding 2,000 jobs, cutting its dividend by 75 percent, even as it continues to expand its global bricks and mortar business with new stores and renovations and looks to beef up online operations, where margins are tight. . Shareholder Varghese said HBC should consider closing stores, but company executives have said there are no plans to do so. HBC, which also operates its namesake store in Canada and Kaufhof in Europe, hopes the restructuring plan announced last week will help mitigate some of the industry upheaval that has hit U.S. retailers Nordstrom Inc and Macy's Inc .  HBC ... must pull on its real estate levers now to preserve equity value and reassure confidence in its investor base,  said M Partners Research analyst Steven Salz in a note to clients on Monday.

The central bank is scheduled to release its decision at 2 p.m EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is due to hold a press conference at 2:30 pm EDT (1830 GMT).  The expectation of a rate hike...is widely held, and has been reinforced by the most recent round of Fed communications,  said Michael Feroli, an economist with J.P. Morgan. Economists polled by Reuters overwhelmingly see the Fed raising its benchmark rate to a target range of 1.00 to 1.25 percent this week. The Fed embarked on its first tightening cycle in more than a decade in December 2015. A quarter percentage point interest rate rise on Wednesday would be the second nudge upwards this year following a similar move in March. Since then, the unemployment rate has fallen to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent and economic growth appears to have reaccelerated following a lackluster first quarter. However, other indicators of the economy's health have been more mixed. The Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation has retreated to 1.5 percent from 1.8 percent earlier in 2017 and investors are growing increasingly doubtful policymakers will be able to stick to their anticipated pace of tightening of three interest rate rises this year and next.  There are also growing doubts on the size and scope of fiscal stimulus the Trump administration may inject into the U.S. economy with campaign promises on tax reform, financial regulation rollbacks and infrastructure spending either still on the drawing board or facing hurdles in Congress. A police officer keeps watch in front of the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington October 12, 2016.Kevin LamarqueBalance Sheet in Focus Fed policymakers' confidence in their outlook will be on show on Wednesday when they release their latest set of quarterly projections on growth, unemployment and inflation as well as their expected rate hike path.  Few economists expect major changes in the Fed's overall forecasts this time around, although the extent of jitters on inflation moving away from the Fed's 2 percent goal will likely be reflected at an individual level. Markets are, however, increasingly anxious for the Fed to give a clearer steer on the timing and details of its previously announced plan to reduce this year its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the financial crisis to help keep rates low and bolster the economy.  If the Fed is serious about reducing the size of its balance sheet this year and wishes to communicate those plans well in advance, it is running out of time to do so,  said Michael Pearce, an economist with Capital Economics. More detail could come as part of the policy statement or during Yellen's press conference. The central bank used the minutes of its last policy meeting to flag up a plan that would feature halting reinvestments of ever-larger amounts of maturing securities. Under the proposal, a limit would be set on the amount of securities allowed to fall off the balance sheet every month. Initially, the cap would be set at a low level, but every three months the Fed would raise it, allowing deeper cuts to its holdings. The Fed has yet to indicate the size of the monthly caps or their quarterly increases. After this week's meeting, policymakers meet four more times this year, with the Fed seen actually reducing its holdings either in September or December.

With networks spanning the globe, trading houses are trying to mitigate global criticism around the harm the fuel causes. Japan, which had to burn record amounts of the dirtiest fossil fuel to generate power after the Fukushima disaster in 2011 paralysed its nuclear sector, seeks to slash its carbon emissions by 26 percent by 2030 from 2013 levels. Among recent thermal coal asset sales by Japanese trading houses is Mitsubishi's decision to offload its minority stakes in Hunter Valley Operations and Warkworth mine in Australia, tagging along with Rio Tinto's  sale of those assets. Last week, miner-trader Glencore said it had offered $2.55 billion cash for the Rio mines, outbidding an offer from Chinese-owned Yancoal.  We've decided to sell ... to whichever of the two bidders wins the bid,  Mitsubishi said on Tuesday. Yancoal has offered to buy Mitsubishi's stakes for $940 million, while Glencore has offered $920 million cash. Mitsubishi is also considering selling a stake in the Clermont coal mine in Australia. If sold, the company would be left with a stake in one thermal coal mine.  It makes sense to sell thermal coal assets as they generate lower profit than coking coal and given global environmental pressure to shift away from coal, but a key question is whether Mitsubishi could buy better assets at low price,  said Nomura Securities senior analyst Yasuhiro Narita. After posting its first ever annual loss in the year to March 2016 due to a commodity slump, Mitsubishi has been reshuffling its natural resources portfolio to focus on three core assets: coking coal, copper, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Other Japanese trading houses have also been cutting or freezing investments in thermal coal. Last month, Mitsui & Co said it would invest mainly in iron ore, LNG and oil and had no plans to invest in new thermal coal mines amid environmental concerns. In 2016, Mitsui said it planned to cut its exposure to coal by a third within three years. Sojitz is also limiting investment in coal.  We'll continue to seek opportunities to cut some of our thermal coal assets and raise our coking coal exposure,  Sojitz President Yoji Sato has said, adding that a recovery in thermal coal prices provides a good opportunity to sell stakes in low-quality coal mines. Thermal coal prices more than doubled from January 2016 to a peak of $109.69 a tonne in November, but have since retreated to $80.79. Coking coal, used to make steel, is currently priced at around $146 per tonne.

With the exception of Qatar, which has plunged this month because of the embargo imposed on it by other Arab states, Dubai has been the worst-performing major stock market in the Middle East over the past 12 months.     Its index is up only 2.7 percent from a year ago, underperforming markets such as Kuwait, which is up 24.9 percent, and even Saudi Arabia, which has been hit hard by low oil prices but is still 3.8 percent higher.     It is far behind MSCI's emerging market index, which is up 18.6 percent over the past 12 months.     That has surprised many fund managers and proved costly for some. Dubai is one of the Middle Eastern markets most exposed to foreign funds and it is in MSCI's emerging market index, suggesting it should benefit from the strength of emerging markets globally.     In contrast to much of the rest of the Middle East, Dubai's economy is growing strongly; with big tourism, foreign trade and light manufacturing sectors, it is more diverse and less vulnerable to low oil prices than other Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia.     And Dubai is looking cheap. Its market is trading at about 9.6 times projected corporate earnings for the next 12 months, compared to 13.9 times for Saudi Arabia and 12.9 times for MSCI emerging market stocks, Thomson Reuters data shows.     But all of these factors are being outweighed by Dubai's heavy exposure to its real estate sector and by sharp losses in a few high-profile stocks, which have driven some investors out of the market, fund managers say.     “The over-dependence of the economy on real estate - which is softening - and the exposure of banks to that sector has left institutional funds with little reason to rotate aggressively into that market,” said Talal Samhouri, head of asset management at Doha-based Amwal Capital.          REAL ESTATE     Real estate firms and banks, whose loan quality depends greatly on real estate prices, dominate Dubai's bourse, accounting for almost two-fifths of its $81 billion capitalisation.     Residential real estate prices have been soft for a couple of years and while some analysts say a recovery could begin next year, the strength of any rebound is in doubt as the prospect of fresh supply weighs on prices.     Last week Dubai's top real estate developer, Emaar Properties, tried to lift the gloom by announcing it would offer a stake in its local real estate unit to the public and use the proceeds to distribute a dividend to shareholders.     That announcement has lifted the Dubai index by about 3 percent, but another issue overhangs the market: the poor performance of several high-profile companies such as builders Arabtec and Drake & Scull (DSI).     Arabtec shares have plunged 42 percent this year and DSI has lost as much as 31 percent. Both companies have embarked on complex capital restructuring plans involving steps such as share cancellations, rights issues and outside investment.     Minority shareholders have lost heavily and have been forced to guess about financial plans for their companies. This has pushed some disappointed investors out of the stock market, shrinking liquidity and therefore making the market less attractive to fund managers.     Daily trading volumes in Dubai over the last three months have been roughly half the levels seen in previous months.     “There has been a lot of complex activity in the smaller sized companies and those actions are sparsely communicated to the public,  said one regional portfolio manager.       There still needs to be a lot more transparency to build trust between investors and the marketplace.      Dubai has also lost liquidity to some other regional markets this year because of special factors. A sharp rally in Kuwait lured money there from across the region; Saudi Arabia has attracted interest because MSCI may decide on June 20 to put Riyadh on a list for possible upgrade to emerging market status.     Samhouri at Amwal said that despite attractive valuations, Dubai's market might not boom again until it found a new catalyst, such as a wave of mergers and acquisitions, or a decision by firms to raise curbs on foreign investment in them.

The move comes as a bill allowing the central bank to make lenders cap loans, if needed, is at risk of failing in parliament, drawing sharp criticism from the bank's Governor Jiri Rusnok on Tuesday. Czech lending growth is close to the fastest since 2009 as record low interest rates spur demand, especially in housing, where low supply and cheap mortgages have driven up prices on new apartments in Prague by a fifth in the past year. Economists and real estate experts have yet to call it a bubble but, seeking to get ahead of problems, the central bank has taken steps such as giving banks recommendations to limit mortgage sizes - for which it now wants legal power to enforce. The bank has also set a countercyclical  bad times  buffer rate on banks of 0.5 percent valid from this year which will double to 1.0 percent from July 2018. The bank said it stood ready to increase the rate or cut it, depending on developments.  We are a country where property prices are probably rising the fastest in the whole European Union, so risk features are clearly present on the horizon,  Rusnok told reporters.  That is why we are trying to react and approach this reasonably.  He added the bank would have decided to raise the buffer rate regardless of the state of the draft law in parliament. Czech banks made it through the global financial crisis almost a decade ago relatively unscathed and remain highly capitalized but some have cut back dividends in reaction to higher capital requirements. The biggest banks in the country are CSOB, owned by Belgium's KBC, Ceska Sporitelna, owned by Austria's Erste Group Bank, and Komercni Banka, owned by France's Societe Generale. Prague-listed shares of Komercni Banka and Moneta Money Bank were little changed on Tuesday. Lending strength has been helped by strong economic growth and the lowest unemployment in the European Union, boosting wages. But rising house prices, especially in Prague, are beginning to exclude some from the market. The draft bill would allow the central bank to cap loans according to debt-to-income, debt-servicing-to-income and loan-to-value ratios. Opponents say it will shut young couples and families out of the market. Since April, the bank has recommended banks provide mortgages that should not exceed 90 percent of property values. In its annual financial stability report, the central bank said the banking sector remained resilient to potential shocks and would maintain solid capital adequacy even in a  very unlikely  adverse scenario projected by stress tests.

Holding hostages during his standoff with police, Mateen claimed allegiance to a leader of the Islamic State militant group before he was killed in an exchange of gunfire with authorities. His widow, Noor Salman, is charged in federal court with aiding and abetting Mateen's attack and lying to authorities. She was not present for the shooting and has pleaded not guilty.

The Mannheim-based ZEW research institute said its economic sentiment index fell to 18.6 from 20.6 in May. The Reuters consensus forecast was for a rise to 21.5. A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions rose to 88.0 from 83.9 last month, reaching the highest level since July 2011. This compared with the Reuters consensus forecast of 85.0.  The prospects for the German economy remain favourable. This is not least due to the positive gross domestic product growth in the European Union in the first quarter of 2017,  said ZEW President Achim Wambach in a statement. The German economy ministry said in its monthly report on Tuesday that an upturn in Germany was continuing during the second quarter, helped by noticeable rises in private and state spending and by an increase in industrial activity. It added that a slight revival of the global economy was supporting German exports, which in April rose more strongly than expected. Coupled with a rise in industrial production in the same month, that fuelled hopes that the German economy can continue a recovery that started nine years ago.  In the slightly revived global environment, German exports remain pointing upwards,  said the ministry, adding it also saw a continuation of the trend of a falling current account surplus, in evidence since mid-2016. The closely watched Ifo business morale index, which hit an all-time high in May and will next be published on June 26, will provide another snapshot of the health of the German economy.  The fact that the ZEW index remains in positive territory means that the majority of investors still see economic conditions improving in the next six months,  said Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics.  The message is a broadly encouraging one,  she added.

The protests, called by Navalny, a strong critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, drew thousands of people and were some of the biggest in Russia since 2012.   Russia without Putin  and  Russia will be free  chanted the demonstrators, including many young people, who crowded into central Moscow on a public holiday. Navalny, who is mounting a long-shot bid to unseat Putin in an election next year, had called for mass protests in Moscow and other cities against official corruption. The Kremlin has dismissed Navalny's graft allegations, accusing him of irresponsibly trying to whip up unrest. The scale of Monday's protests in Moscow and smaller ones in St. Petersburg and scores of other cities suggests Navalny has maintained his campaign's momentum despite more than 1,000 people being arrested after the last such protest in March. That is likely to embolden him to call for more protests and keep Putin, who is expected to run for and win re-election next year, under rare domestic pressure.  Neither mass detentions nor criminal cases after March 26 (the last protest) worked,  wrote Lyubov Sobol, a Navalny ally, on social media.  People are not afraid.    The OVD-Info monitoring group, a non-profit organization, said preliminary figures showed 730 people had been detained in Moscow. The Interior Ministry said 500 people were detained in St Petersburg. Related CoverageWhite House condemns Russia's crackdown on protestersRussian police detained 500 protesters in St Petersburg: ministryPepper spray used on protesters in central Moscow: Reuters witnessNavalny's wife, Yulia, said her husband was detained as he tried to leave their home. Reuters witnesses saw a police car leaving his apartment compound at high speed, followed a few minutes later by a minibus carrying about 10 policemen. Electricity in his office was cut at around the same time as he was detained, briefly bringing down a live feed of the protests, Navalny's spokeswoman said. At a midnight court hearing, a Russian judge later found Navalny guilty of repeatedly violating the law on organizing public meetings and sentenced him to 30 days in prison. Navalny served a 15-day jail term after the protest in March.   Changes Authorities in Moscow said Monday's protest was illegal and drafted in riot police who fired pepper spray and used batons to break it up, detaining people and bundling them onto buses. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny talks to journalists during a hearing at a court in Moscow, Russia, June 12, 2017.Sergei KarpukhinRoman, a 19-year-old student, said Navalny's campaign against official corruption had struck a chord.  I'm sick of the Putin system,  he said.  It's been unchanged for the last 17 years. There is so much evidence that our officials are stealing with impunity.  Dima, an 18-year-old florist, said he wanted Prime Minister Medvedev to return what he said were the politician's ill-gotten gains. Medvedev, a close Putin ally, flatly denies wrongdoing.  I'm not afraid if I get detained,  Dima said. The Interior Ministry said the turnout at the Moscow protest was about 4,500 - significantly fewer than the numbers estimated by Reuters reporters, who put the turnout in the low tens of thousands. Slideshow (15 Images)State media ignored the demonstrations, broadcasting Soviet-style coverage of Putin handing out state awards instead. Navalny brought thousands onto the streets across Russia in March, the largest such protests since a wave of anti-Kremlin demonstrations in 2012. Navalny was fined and jailed for 15 days for his role in those protests. Moscow authorities had initially authorized a venue for Monday's protest away from the city center. But Navalny switched it to Tverskaya Street, Moscow's main avenue near the Kremlin. The General Prosecutor's Office had warned that a protest there would be illegal. The area of Tverskaya Street near where Navalny's supporters congregated was hosting an officially organized festival, with actors re-enacting periods of Russian history. Video footage showed a protester clambering onto a mock-up of a wartime sandbag fortification holding a poster calling Putin a liar, before being pulled to the ground by a cast member dressed as a World War Two Soviet soldier.    For now, polls suggest Navalny has scant chance of unseating Putin, who enjoys high ratings. It is unclear too if the Kremlin will even let Navalny run for the presidency.  But the 41-year-old lawyer turned political street campaigner hopes anger over corruption may boost his support.  A video he made accusing Medvedev of living far beyond his means has garnered over 22 million online views to date. Navalny, who had a green liquid thrown in his face in April, robbing him of some of his sight, said hundreds of people had also attended demonstrations in Russia's Far East on Monday morning.  I want changes,  wrote Navalny in a blog post last week.  I want to live in a modern democratic state and I want our taxes to be converted into roads, schools and hospitals, not into yachts, palaces and vineyards.

The centre-left government proposed in March reducing the central bank's foreign currency reserves by around 200 billion crowns ($23 billion) and use the money to pay off the country's sovereign debt. Several Riksbank board members have spoken out against the minority government's plan, saying it could leave insufficient buffers to deal with a future financial crisis and pose risks to the economy. Ingves, who is expected to step down at the turn of the year after more than a decade as Riksbank chief, slammed the plans again in a parliament hearing on Tuesday and also raised the issue of whether the proposal is in line with EU law.  As far as I can judge, it is designed in such a way that it violates EU regulations, it encroaches on the independence of the Riksbank and it makes it harder for us to handle financial stability,  he said in a parliament hearing.  All in all, this is not a well thought through proposal.  Financial Markets Minister Per Bolund told reporters after the hearing that the government disagreed with the view the proposal would breach EU law and that it would never put something forward that contravenes current legislation.

The Riksbank boosted its currency reserves after the 2008-2009 crisis to enable it to provide emergency liquidity for Sweden's outsized banking system, which has assets of around four times the country's gross domestic product. Under the government's plans, the debt office would be tasked with raising foreign reserves if needed in case of a crisis.  That creates two currency reserves, one at the debt office and one at the Riksbank, which de facto creates two central banks in Sweden,  Ingves said.

A poll of 100 economists conducted last week showed the Fed was certain to push interest rates up by 25 basis points to 1.00 percent-1.25 percent at its June 13-14 meeting.     However, the conviction for a move beyond a widely expected rise this month has faded for many forecasters along with the outlook for inflation for most. For a graphic on the Fed: reut.rs/2sawFta      (We) expect Asian bourses to continue to tread water with a topping of caution ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),  OCBC Bank said in a note.     The positive sentiment across the region was also supported by oil prices, which edged up following statements that OPEC leader Saudi Arabia was making significant supply cuts to customers.     Vietnam extended gains to post its highest close in over nine years, underpinned by financial and industrial stocks.     Gains on the benchmark index were broad-based with eight of nine sectors in positive territory.     Singapore shares shed the previous day's losses, boosted by gains in the city-state's  big three  banks.     The final first-quarter jobless rate was revised down from the preliminary estimate of 2.3 percent.     Indonesia edged higher, led by gains in consumer staples.      Indonesia's central bank is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Thursday, just hours after the Fed decides on interest rates, a Reuters poll showed.     Philippine shares closed lower with real-estate stocks accounting for nearly half of the losses.     The country has been seeing a violent conflict in the southern town of Marawai, where a siege by fighters allied to Islamic State, has stoked concerns of instability among Southeast Asian nations.

A very grave mistake is being made in Qatar, isolating a nation in all areas is inhumane and against Islamic values. It's as if a death penalty decision has been taken for Qatar,  Erdogan said.  Qatar has shown the most decisive stance against the terrorist organisation Islamic State alongside Turkey. Victimising Qatar through smear campaigns serves no purpose.  Erdogan also said he would hold a conference call on Tuesday with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and the Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani to discuss recent developments. He said the Saudi King, as the elder statesman in the Gulf region, should take the lead to resolve the crisis. Erdogan is also due to discuss the dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump in coming days, Turkey's foreign minister said earlier on Tuesday. The Turkish president has vowed to keep supporting Qatar and has said the dispute should be resolved before the end of the holy month of Ramadan.

The country's civil war erupted in late 2013, uprooting a quarter of the population and causing famine. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said at least 14 community volunteers and health workers had reportedly been forcibly recruited by armed groups in Guit county, in the country's north, as of June 6.  The health facility in Nimni (area in Guit), as well as at least two schools in the area, have been forced to close due to forced recruitment of personnel essential to their operations,  OCHA said in an update late on Monday. The areas are near South Sudan's oil-rich northern border with Sudan, close to the hotly-contested town of Bentiu. South Sudan descended into war after President Salva Kiir fired his deputy, unleashing a conflict that has spawned armed factions often along ethnic lines. The U.N. has warned of a possible genocide, millions face famine, and an estimated 3.5 million have fled their homes - 2 million of them children.  Negotiations for the workers' release is ongoing, it said. Looting of humanitarian supplies has also escalated with 19 incidents so far in 2017, it said.

The new study came as the ECB starts to debate whether growth and inflation have increased enough to wind down the 2.3 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion) scheme or whether another extension is needed beyond this year to keep inflation rising. The initial introduction of the scheme, which has gone through several extensions already, had only a negligible impact on inflation in early 2015. But this grew to 0.18 percentage point by the end of 2015 and 0.36 percentage point in fourth quarter of 2016. The study, which does not necessarily represent the ECB's opinion, focuses on the announcement of the programme and the impact of the first 1.1 trillion euros printed under it. It did not quantify its two extensions and changes in monthly purchase volumes. Having flirted with deflation for years, prices are now rising, albeit only slowly and inflation is still projected to undershoot the ECB's target of almost 2 percent at least through 2019. The scheme's impact on growth was strongest early on before it slowly fade to almost zero by the end of last year, the researchers concluded. In the first quarter of 2015, it boosted growth by 0.18 percentage point and this fell to 0.16 percentage point by the end of 2015 and 0.02 percentage point by the fourth quarter of 2016.

The criteria report is available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking on the link above. Changes to the criteria report mostly relate to clarifying text around the two conditions needed for a debt exchange to be considered by Fitch to be a DDE. The update does not affect existing ratings. The previous Distressed Debt Exchange criteria report dated 8 June 2016 has been retired. When considering whether a debt restructuring should be classified as a DDE, Fitch expects both of the following to apply: the restructuring imposes a material reduction in terms compared with the original contractual terms; and the restructuring or exchange is conducted to avoid bankruptcy, similar insolvency or intervention proceedings, or a traditional payment default.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

The regular survey of businesses measures company output growth by volume, and includes all kinds of firms ranging from manufacturing via retailers to service industries. Norway's economy is heavily dependent on investments in the oil and gas industries and was hard hit by a 60 percent plunge in the price of crude since 2014, although growth has gradually recovered from a seven-year low seen in 2016. The Norwegian central bank's survey of 329 companies showed respondents had seen stronger-than-expected growth since February and expect a further increase ahead.  Output growth has been strengthened by growth in public investment, a less pronounced decline in the oil industry and increased private sector demand,  Norges Bank said.  Contacts expect the pace of growth to rise further over the next six months,  it said of the survey, which informs its rate decisions and interest rate forecasts. The next rate decision is due on June 22, and while economists do not expect a change from the current record low 0.5 percent, it could change the future outlook.  This pulls up the rate path and may mean that we no longer get signals of an easing bias,  Danske Bank Chief Economist Frank Jullum said. DNB Markets Chief Economist Kjersti Haugland said the survey was stronger than expected.  This is another indicator confirming the Norwegian economy is picking up, and boosts the likelihood that the central bank will say capacity utilisation has risen more than anticipated,  she added. Norway's crown currency rose on the news to trade at 9.4475 against the euro at 0913 GMT from 9.4662 just ahead of the 0800 GMT release.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday but this is mostly priced in and is unlikely to trigger much emerging market weakness unless accompanied by unexpectedly hawkish language. MSCI's emerging equity benchmark snapped a two-day losing streak to gain 0.2 percent, lifted by heavyweight South Korea, where shares bounced 0.7 percent after a 1 percent fall fuelled by the U.S. tech share selloff. The rouble and Kazakhstan's tenge gained 0.3 percent, thanks to support from oil which advanced on news Saudi Arabia would make supply cuts. China's yuan also benefited from speculation that a Fed rate hike could see Beijing follow suit, as they did in March. Russian stocks  were the biggest losers, hit by steep losses in technology, financial and mining shares after U.S. senators reached a deal on legislation allowing for fresh sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways as well as on Russians found guilty of human rights abuses. The agreement, which could come up for a vote this week, also included a provision that would prevent the White House from easing, suspending or ending sanctions without congressional approval.  U.S. Senate (moved) a step closer to approving an extensive sanctions bill against Russia, apparently including mining, metals, shipping and railways, plus set in stone others imposed by (former U.S. President Barack) Obama,  said Simon Quijano-Evans, emerging markets strategist at Legal & General Investment Management.  This would certainly be farther-reaching than the executive-order-only imposed sanctions,  he added. However, some of the falls are also down to the market playing catch-up after a long weekend with worldwide equity losses. Russian assets also showed little reaction to the demonstrations across the country on Monday, when baton-wielding riot police broke up anti-corruption protests and detained hundreds of demonstrators. The political tensions in the Gulf continued to weigh on stocks, with Qatar's index dragged lower by the Qatar National Bank - the region's largest lender - which tumbled 1.3 percent. Qatari banks have been reeling under worries that the embargo mounted against Doha by other Arab states could reduce its access to foreign funding.

He heads to the cowshed to join his wife and two daughters, raking manure into big mounds. Using dry twigs as brooms, they are sweeping the green-layered droppings into a fifth pile when they’re interrupted by a loud hooting. Sankare beams excitedly and heads for the gate - his family is about to reap $150 for their labor.  “Prolonged drought is making it hard to find pasture and food,” he explained, estimating a third of his cattle have starved this year. “Selling manure helps me buy food and pay hospital bills for my family.” Demand for manure collected from Kenya's rangelands for use as fertilizer is on the rise.  Scientists at the Nairobi-based International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) say this manure is richer in nitrogen and phosphorous than that from enclosed livestock which do not graze. Crops need nitrogen to develop vegetation, while phosphorous is essential for root formation and the crop’s structure, said Edward Karanja, project leader with ICIPE, which is working to promote the use of manure as fertilizer in Kenya. In Sankare’s village, growing crops is not part of the Maasai community’s traditional sources of income, meaning the potential of their livestock's manure has been overlooked. But that is starting to change. On Mary Wanjiru’s farm in Kangari village in central Kenya, leafy rows of maize, beans and other vegetables promise a generous harvest, even in a season when farmers all over Kenya are expecting poor yields due to insufficient rains. Wanjiru has been farming her one-eighth of an acre using both manure collected from Maasai land and composted manure from her own cow penned on a corner of her land. On the lower strip, where she has applied her composted manure, knee-high maize and beans fight for space to grow.  On the upper strip, where she has used manure from Maasai grazing land, the beans are ankle-high and already putting out tendrils to climb up stakes set in the ground.  “I use only manure on my farm,” said the mother of seven, who is certain she will get a bumper harvest. But finding enough good-quality fertilizer is becoming “a challenge”, she noted. Much of this highland area has been planted with cash crops such as tea, crowding out staple crops, she said. Even keeping livestock is getting tougher due to a lack of fodder for cows and goats, she added. Tea Leaves But for enterprising herders like Sankare, the manure trade offers a new source of income that is helping compensate for losses caused by drought. Sankare estimates he can collect about eight tonnes of manure over a month. That is enough to fertilize 1.5 acres (0.6 hectares) of tea plantation in central Kenya, said James Njuguna, a farmers' field assistant working in the area.   “When manure from Maasai land is applied on the tea farms, the production is higher than expected,” said Njuguna. A tea plant normally yields about 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) of leaves a year, but when enriched with manure, it can produce as much as 3 kg. Kenya’s growing appetite for rangeland manure is creating a new revenue stream – and not just for herders.  David Ngure, a trader in central Kenya, has been selling Maasai manure to farmers for the last two years. In a week, he can supply an average of five truck-loads of 8 tonnes each, which he sells for 36,000 Kenyan shillings (about $348) per load. “Demand for the product among crop farmers is high,” said Ngure. But supplying the orders is a logistical challenge because he must travel as far as 400 km (248.5 miles) to source the manure from pastoralists like Sankare. ICIPE’s Karanja sees big potential in the manure trade because more Kenyans are investing in agriculture. About 80 percent of Kenya is arid and semi-arid land, making pastoralism the main economic activity in those parts. But the government has not done enough to help herders exploit manure as a resource, said Karanja. For instance, they should be encouraged to form co-operatives to make it easier to manage income from selling manure, and save money to buy food when drought hits, he said. There are also environmental benefits, he noted. “Using manure for farming helps store carbon in the soil and prevents it from being released into the atmosphere,” said Karanja. In this way, communities can contribute to reducing climate-changing emissions, he added. Reporting by Kagondu Njagi; editing by Megan Rowling.

Dennis Stattman, who has run what is now BlackRock's largest mutual fund for more than 28 years, will retire from his role at the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund  in August, according to an internal memo on Tuesday. The fund currently has $40 billion in assets under management. Stattman, who turns 66 this month, is  confident that the time is right to complete a carefully planned process of transitioning management of Global Allocation to the team he built,  according to the memo signed by two top BlackRock executives, Rob Kapito and Rich Kushel. A BlackRock spokesman said Stattman was not available to comment. The retirement is the latest sign of a changing order at BlackRock, a bellwether for an industry challenged by investors' flight to lower-cost products. The world's largest asset manager, BlackRock also offers relatively low-fee index funds through its iShares brand. The New York-based company has also been handing over more responsibilities from its traditionalist stockpickers to its data-crunching quantitative investors in a bid to boost performance. In March, the company announced a formal restructuring that cut fees and some portfolio managers. Merrill Lynch & Co started the Global Allocation Fund in 1989 as the market was still clawing back from losses in the 1987 Black Monday market crash. Merrill sold that investment management business to BlackRock, then a much smaller company, in 2006. The fund is a  multi-asset  portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investments, pitched as offering strong returns and protection from market swings. Relatively low-cost institutional shares of the fund have returned nearly 10 percent a year since the fund started 28 years ago, beating most of its few surviving rivals. During the financial crisis in 2008, the fund beat most its peers and managed to take in new cash from investors. Yet Global Allocation has recorded about $25 billion in withdrawals since 2012, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper research unit. The fund's other four portfolio managers - Dan Chamby, Russ Koesterich, David Clayton and Kent Hogshire - will all continue in their roles. Chamby is a veteran at the fund's helm, while Koesterich, Clayton and Hogshire were elevated to portfolio manager roles earlier this year. They will continue to manage a sprawling team of more than 50 people who focus on the fund, including analysts, traders and marketing personnel. Stattman will continue as an adviser to the asset manager's Multi-Asset Strategies Group, which oversees the fund, according to the memo.

Heads of state meeting in Ethiopia said they would set up a forum where the rivals could discuss ways of restoring a ceasefire more than three years into an ethnically-charged civil war that has plunged districts into famine. The forum would be set up urgently, leaders from the East African bloc IGAD said, without specifying when or what form it would take. Fighting broke out at the end of 2013 after President Salva Kiir sacked his rival Riek Machar as vice president, just two years after South Sudan's independence from Sudan. After numerous failed peace deals, Kiir and Machar signed a power-sharing pact in August 2015, agreeing to a transitional government and elections. But that deal stalled and Machar left the country. IGAD said on Monday their new forum would include  estranged groups  and discuss ways of implementing the peace deal. The forum would also develop a  revised and realistic timeline and implementation schedule towards a democratic election at the end of the transition period,  IGAD added in a statement. South Sudan's new vice president, Taban Deng Gai, had asked Monday's meeting to bar Machar from any future forums. Gai also said elections should go ahead as planned - a position initially backed by Yoweri Museveni, the president of South Sudan's neighbour Uganda, according to diplomats at the talks. But the delegates finally decided warring sides would be invited and it would be  too premature  to stage the vote given the current levels of violence, diplomats said. The war has split the impoverished country along ethnic lines, often between Kiir's Dinka group and Machar's Nuer. It has also nearly halved oil production and fueled Africa's biggest cross-border refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The United Nations has said the violence amounts to ethnic cleansing and risks escalating into genocide.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.6 percent, almost fully recovering losses from the previous session, while Italy's benchmark rose 1 percent. Europe's tech sector eased back after Monday's sell-off when concerns over valuations in U.S. companies had spilled over to European peers, particularly companies supplying Apple.  The tech sector has been relied upon as the driver of the bull-run, particularly in the U.S., so whenever there is any weakness that's observed there, it is quickly picked up by the market,  Jonathan Roy, advisory investment manager at Charles Hanover Investments, said.  The sector is fairly well-valued, in some respects quite richly-valued, so that could be a weakness if we do see a souring in sentiment.  Dialog Semiconductor, Infineon and ASM International were among the top gainers in the sector, up around 2 to 3 percent while the broader sector rose 1.3 percent. Italian banks were another bright spot, buoyed by renewed hopes over a bailout for struggling Veneto banks, with the Italian economy minister saying that the country was  close  to a solution amid talks with the European Union. Italian lenders UBI Banca and BPER Banca led the European banking index, rising 4.6 percent and 2.1 percent respectively, while UniCredit also gained 1.4 percent.  It's quite evident that the authorities are not too keen to let any institutions really, really fail ... there's always a last-minute deal done for them,  Charles Hanover Investments' Roy said, adding that he saw value in Italy and Spain over the next 18 to 24 months. Among individual stocks, shares in troubled British outsourcing firm Capita jumped 12 percent after the group reiterated its outlook, saying that it hoped to improve its profitability and secure more contract wins in the second half of 2017 following a series of profit warnings. Visitor attractions group Merlin Entertainments fell around 2.5 percent, however, after striking a cautious tone in its outlook and saying that attacks in Manchester and London had hit domestic demand. Broker action also propelled shares in London Stock Exchange Group 4.4 percent higher after Credit Suisse and RBC raised their target prices on the stock. This helped Britain's FTSE 100 gain 0.2 percent. Strength in the energy sector also helped underpin gains, with Petrofac the biggest oil & gas riser.

OTP firmed by over 1.5 percent to a four-month high of 9,095 forints ($33.22), after JP Morgan changed its target to 12,000 forints from 9,860 forints.      The last time we saw similar value (from JP Morgan) was in 2007,  Erste analysts said in a note.          Central European markets were generally idle as investors awaited key signals about global interest rate trends from the Federal Reserve's meeting on Wednesday.     The week will be also short for many investors in Poland, the region's biggest economy, which will have a national holiday on Thursday.      The tone of the Fed's comments will be key... while it is summer and that also keeps a lid on activity,  said Zoltan Varga, analyst of Equilor brokerage.     Regional currencies were mixed, with the zloty and the forint firming 0.1 percent against the euro, staying well within the past few weeks' narrow ranges.     The leu eased a shade.     Investors were not worried over inflation after a jump in Hungary's annual farm producer price index to 4.1 percent in April from 1.4 percent in March and continuing double-digit annual rise in Romanian net wages in April.      Romanian data published on Monday showed that annual inflation remained low at 0.6t percent in May, while concerns remain that it could jump, along with the budget deficit, by next year, keeping the leu under pressure.     While European politics lacked new developments, investors also shrugged off domestic politics. Local political tension usually affects asset prices only when international markets are also nervous.     The European Commission is expected to launch legal cases against the Czechs, Hungary and Poland later on Tuesday for failing to take in asylum-seekers in a quota scheme.      In Croatia, foreign minister Davor Ivo Stier resigned on Monday, following the formation of a new coalition including the conservatives and the liberals. The dinar traded mildly firmer against the euro on Tuesday.     The Czech central bank said it was doubling the amount  banks must put aside as a precaution for hard times as of July next year because of rapid credit growth.     Its governor, Jiri Rusnok also pushed lawmakers to give the bank more powers to tame the growing home loan market.      Bank stocks listed in Prague were mixed. The crown was steady against the euro, off last Friday's the 3-and-1/2-year highs.

Victoria state police said in a statement on their website that the 47-year-old male suspect faced three charges, including possession of a firearm unlawfully, possessing ammunition without a permit and being an unlicensed firearm dealer. He appeared in court earlier in the day. A 25-year-old man was arrested and charged in relation to the firearm on Monday and a 30-year-old man was charged on Friday in connection with the same matter, police said. The deadly siege took place on June 6 in Australia's second-largest city of Melbourne, with police shooting dead gunman Yacqub Khayre after he killed a man in the foyer of an apartment block and held a woman hostage inside. Turnbull had said police were treating the siege, during which three officers were injured, as an  act of terrorism  after a claim by the Islamic State group that one of its fighters was the gunman responsible. Australia, a staunch ally of the United States and its action against the Islamic State militant group in Syria and Iraq, is on high alert for attacks by sympathizers of the group.  The national terror threat level remains at 'probable' and we are not immune from the global impact of the conflicts in the Middle East and the instability around the world,  Turnbull told parliament.   Australia has also signaled a drive to reform parole laws as a result of the Melbourne siege, including a ban on parole for violent offenders who have any links to extremism. Khayre was on parole for a violent break-and-enter offense. Reporting by Jamie Freed; Editing by Robert Birsel","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-siege-arrests-idUSKBN19412V"},

A reconciliation between the Sunni Muslim kingdom and majority Shi'ite Iraq would be a boost to the Gulf Arab region, where tensions are sky high, both within and with Iran. Last week Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other Arab countries severed ties with Qatar. Doha denies their accusations of it backing Islamist militants and Iran.  Days later attacks in Tehran killed 17 people, claimed by hardline Sunni militants Islamic State. Iran has accused Saudi Arabia of funding Islamist militants, including IS. Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi and King Salman will meet on Wednesday at the Saudi Red Sea port of Jeddah, the London-based newspaper Asharq al-Awsat reported, citing Saudi State Minister for Gulf Affairs Thamer al-Sabhan. The Iraqi government spokesman did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. Abadi has been eager to keep Iraq out of the dispute between Qatar and its neighbors. On Sunday, he denied press reports which had angered Gulf Arab states suggesting that hundreds of millions of dollars sent by Qatar to Baghdad for the freeing in April of a group of abducted Qatari royals had ended up in Iran. The royals were abducted in 2015 in southern Iraq, a region controlled by Iranian-backed groups.  Iraq lies on the fault line between Shi'ite Iran and the mostly-Sunni Arab world. Deep-running animosity and distrust between the two sides is fueled by sectarian divides.  Tensions grew further after Iran, by leveraging its ties with Iraq's Shi'ites, has emerged as the main power broker in Iraq after the United States withdrew its troops in 2011. Tehran also been a key support in Iraq's efforts to defeat Islamic State, providing military assistance to Shi'ite paramilitary fighting the Sunni insurgents who declared a ''caliphate'' over parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014. King Salman and Abadi last met in March on the sidelines of the Arab summit and in February Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir made a rare visit to Baghdad in February. Improved ties may also help heal deep and bitter divisions between Iraq's Shi'ite majority and Sunni population.

U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers gather in Washington for their two-day meeting against the backdrop of a slide in tech stocks that serves as a warning of how tighter financial conditions may hurt sectors where valuations appear stretched. That sell-off, which centred on Wall Street, abated in Asia and Europe on Tuesday, but there were other flash points in currency and debt markets as the Fed's next move was seen potentially influencing central banks in Canada and China. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate in a decision scheduled for Wednesday and may also provide more details on its plans to shrink $4.5 trillion dollars of assets it amassed to nurse the economic recovery. The Canadian dollar hit a two-month high after a policymaker said the central bank would assess if it needs to keep rates at near-record lows as the economy grows, while the prospect of the Chinese central bank raising short-term rates has come as its yield curve inverts in a worrying sign for growth. The gap between benchmark U.S and European bond yields hit its widest in a month as the Fed meeting also shone a light on the slow pace of change in European Central Bank policy.  If the Fed is tightening policy and embarking on a gradual normalisation path, whether it is the short-term policy rates or the balance sheet, it wants the market to believe it and to adjust to it,  said Frederik Ducrozet, an economist at Pictet Wealth Management.  It is not just about complacency and the creation of financial bubbles...but also about its own credibility.  The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England also meet this week, although no major policy changes are expected. Stocks Rebound Asian and European stocks rebounded on Tuesday despite U.S. tech stocks having notched up a 3.5 percent fall over the past two sessions, driven by losses at Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft. European stocks rebounded from seven-week lows in early deals on Tuesday as shares in tech firms recovered and financials rose. The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX index> was up 0.5 percent, partly recovering losses from the previous session following a brutal sell-off in tech stocks. The tech sector was the top sectoral gainer, up 1.1 percent after posting a 3.6 percent loss on Monday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent, recouping about half of the previous session's losses. The MSCI Asia Pacific Information Technology index steadied, after sliding 1.4 percent on Monday. Some analysts had predicted Asian tech shares would not see as intense a sell-off as their U.S. peers as their valuations were less stretched.  Comparatively, valuations for the IT sector in the Asia Pacific region are less expensive compared to the U.S., which may be why we're not seeing the situation further aggravate for a second session,  said Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG in Singapore. For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets A small majority of traders in China's financial markets think its central bank will likely raise short-term interest rates again this week if the U.S. Federal Reserve hikes its key policy rate, according to a Reuters poll. But the reaction to this in bond markets has been concerning. China's two-year yields have in the last few sessions risen above its 10-year yields - a trend that has only happened in a few instances over the past decade and suggests investors have worries over the long-term health of the world's second biggest economy. Canadian Surprise In currencies, the Canadian dollar strengthened about 0.4 percent to trade at C$1.326, after gaining 1.1 percent on Monday. Monday's comments from a Bank of Canada official was a change in tone for the central bank, which said earlier this year that rate cuts remain on the table.  It feels like a long time since markets have been treated to unscheduled hints of tightening, and this was quite apparent when you saw the positive reaction of CAD crosses overnight,  Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at ThinkMarkets in Melbourne, wrote in a note. Against a broad basked of trade-weighted peers, the U.S. dollar was a touch weaker. Sterling recovered around 0.3 percent against the euro and the dollar, having fallen almost 3 percent slide since the first hint of UK election results on Thursday night, helped by hopes domestic politics may be inching towards a  softer  and less economically damaging Brexit. In commodities, oil advanced on news that Saudi Arabia would make supply cuts to customers. <O/R< Brent crude futures LCOc1 were at $48.51 per barrel at 0649 GMT, up 22 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last close.

Relief was palpable after Monday's dip, which hit UK tech firms Micro Focus and Sophos, but trading remained muted with the FTSE 100 up just 0.2 percent as investors continued to sift through the fall-out from Britain's election.  There's a tendency to turn to one factor and attribute it to that, but people always just get nervous when valuations get very high, as they did with these companies,  said Laura Foll, UK Equity fund manager at Henderson. Capita jumped 12.5 percent to its highest level in eight months after its trading update suggested green shoots of recovery were appearing. The outsourcing firm was set for its best day in 17 years as analysts praised progress in its efforts to restructure the business which has suffered a string of profit warnings and demotion from the blue-chip index.  Capita's pre-close interim management statement points to progress on many fronts as Capita works through a  transitional  year,  said UBS analysts. Capita helped mid-caps gain 0.5 percent, outperforming the blue-chips. The morning after Prime Minister Theresa May's grilling by Conservative MPs following a disastrous election, investors eyed the shifting sands and looked for signs the government's stance on Brexit was softening.  There seems to be a shift towards staying in the single market and the customs union,  said Foll.  That would be pretty significant for our portfolio if it did prove to be true.  London Stock Exchange led the FTSE higher after the firm said it expected growth, shrugging off the disappointment of a scuppered merger with Deutsche Boerse. Merlin fell to the bottom of the index after the entertainment company behind Madame Tussaud's waxworks museum and Legoland said militant attacks in London and Manchester had dented demand. The company's shares have been the most sensitive to recent attacks. Ashtead gained 1.6 percent as growth in its core North American market boosted its profits for the year, and the firm said it had seen good seasonal uplift to its industrial equipment rental business.  Ashtead sees good markets with a seasonal uplift in volumes, and we see little change to consensus,  said UBS analysts.  Trading remains strong, but without guidance upgrades we believe valuation looks exposed.  Meanwhile, among mid-caps, oil services firm Petrofac gained 5.8 percent, among the top European stocks, boosted by a $35 million contract with the Kuwait Oil Company. Property company Kennedy Wilson Europe jumped 9 percent after its U.S. parent company sweetened a deal to buy it back.

The Fed, which last raised rates by 25 basis points at its March meeting, has penciled in three increases this year based on the view that inflation will eventually edge higher as a result of a tighter labor market that has driven the unemployment rate to a 16-year low. Yet since March the Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation has fallen to 1.5 percent year-on-year after touching 1.8 percent in February, even as unemployment rate has dropped to 4.3 percent of the workforce. The central bank is likely to go ahead with another 25-basis-point rate increase on Wednesday, the fourth hike of a rate increase cycle that started in December 2015, citing the improvement in the economy and temporary factors driving down prices.   Fed officials have already noted a 9-percent drop in the cost of cellphone plans since February. Falling pharmaceuticals prices and slower rent increases have also mitigated inflationary pressures.  But the concern is the Fed and other central banks have been here before, consistently over-estimating inflation in the recovery from the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the pace at which interest rates would rise back towards pre-crisis levels.  They are betting on the labor market tightness. They are still feeling that will eventually lead to higher wages, higher inflation,” said Omair Sharif, an economist at Societe Generale. But that has been the Fed's bet for the past six or seven years, he said.  There's a real chance that if the inflation data doesn't cooperate the Fed is going to have to rethink.   The Fed has missed its inflation forecasts made at the end of 2012, 2013 and 2014. Those misses could be mostly attributed to forecasting errors over the price of oil and the value of the dollar, factors largely outside the Fed's control. But now the 1.9 percent forecast for the end of this year, which Fed officials have maintained since December 2015 when they started raising rates from zero, also looks at risk. Weakening Conviction Investors are already taking notice.  A Reuters poll last week showed economists expect the central bank to follow its June move with another 25 basis point increase in the third quarter to take the fed funds rate to 1.25-1.50 percent.  But one in five said their conviction for that third 2017 rate hike was fading, and traders of short-term rate futures now see just one rate hike in 2018, down from two forecast earlier this year.   They are scaling back their expectations against the backdrop of inflationary pressures ebbing not just in the United States, but globally. The European Central Bank last week cut its inflation forecasts and predicted weak prices for years to come. The ECB has done no better than the Fed with its predictions and had said it expected to see inflation approaching 2 percent ever since it started making point forecasts in December 2013. Other major central banks are also cutting their inflation forecasts. The Reserve Bank of India made substantial downward revisions last week and the Bank of Japan is expected to recalibrate its forecasts in July. In China producer price inflation eased for a third successive month in May, the latest data available, suggesting a cool-down in the world's second-largest economy. One factor that has repeatedly confounded policymakers was the behavior of incomes during the post-crisis recovery. Even as the U.S. unemployment rate has almost halved in the past five years, earnings have barely ticked higher, with annual increases picking up to 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent. In 2007, the last time the unemployment rate was firmly below 5 percent,  earnings were rising by 3.5 percent a year. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has argued the Fed must act on its forecasts because changes in interest rate policy can take more than a year to impact the whole economy. She also notes that the central bank is moving slowly to remove monetary accommodation. Carl Tannenbaum, Northwestern Trust's chief economist, said the Fed is not alone in its struggle to predict how prices will behave.  If you would have told me that U.S. unemployment rate would be down to 4.3 percent and still have core inflation struggling to get above 1.5 percent, I would have been very, very surprised,  Tannenbaum said.

But they could reduce the amount they pay in claims and offer lower premiums if they considered the impact of natural infrastructure.   If you are in a more resilient city, compared to a less resilient one, then those risk levels should be taken into account in pricing,  said Trevor Maynard, head of innovation at Lloyd's. Insurers should invest more in habitat conservation to reduce the risks from coastal floods, the report, by the Center for the Blue Economy, the University of California, Santa Cruz and The Nature Conservancy, said.  Flood risk reduction should be undertaken before the flood occurs, but we currently spend much more on recovery efforts than on risk reduction.   Coastal wetlands remaining in the northeast of the United States saved more than $625 million in flood damages from Hurricane Sandy, around 1 percent of the total flood damages from the 2012 hurricane, previous research for Lloyd's has shown. Public and private sector financing to support natural infrastructure is increasing, but  the availability is geographically uneven,  the report said.

The rating action reflects Fitch's view that default is now probable and possible remedies that avoid a debt restructuring have all but evaporated. The company has also hired lawyers and investment bankers to contemplate debt restructuring ahead of a coupon payment due in August 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS Default is Probable: We believe that GATE will struggle to pay the USD55 million bond coupon. Its end-March cash balance of USD77 million will be depleted further as we expect GATE to have an FCF deficit of around USD70 million-80 million in 2017. We estimate its 2017 EBITDA of USD150 million will be insufficient to cover annual interest cost of USD110 million and maintenance capex of USD100 million. Excessive Refinancing Risk: GATE has an unsustainable capital structure and limited access to external financing. It had only USD11.5 million of undrawn committed bank facilities at end-March 2017. We think that the company will struggle to redeem secured notes due in February 2019. We believe that the company's legal dispute with a group of holders of the first tranche of its first-lien bonds is likely to remain unresolved in the medium term. Compromised Business Model: Fitch expects GATE's EBITDA to stay relatively flat at around USD150 million in 2017, underpinned by slow recovery in global demand for semiconductors. GATE lacks the technological capability and pricing power in the fragmented USD25 billion OSAT industry to be able to service its current level of debt. GATE's independent auditor has given a disclaimer of opinion, concluding that it is unable to obtain sufficient evidence regarding the likely outcome of any negotiations with bondholders over interest payment. Therefore, the auditor has not expressed an opinion on the 2016 financial statements. DERIVATION SUMMARY The rating action reflects Fitch's assessment that short-term liquidity has deteriorated to a position where default is probable. The company is not likely to be able to pay its August 2017 coupon, and the capital structure is unsustainable with excessive refinancing risk given that we expect cash generation to be insufficient to cover interest costs and maintenance capex. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue to stay relatively flat in 2017. - Operating EBITDA margin of 22%-23% in 2017-2018 (2016: 22.4%). - Annual capex of USD100 million in 2017-2018. - Annual cash taxes and cash interest of around USD10 million and USD110 million, respectively. - No asset sales or capital injection. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Default is imminent or inevitable, or the issuer is in standstill - In Fitch's opinion, the company has experienced an uncured payment default - Announcement by the company, or its agent, of a distressed debt exchange Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Improvement in its liquidity position such that it can pay its short-term obligations. LIQUIDITY Liquidity to Worsen:  Fitch expects liquidity stress to increase in the next 12 months, based on a cash balance of USD77 million as of end-March 2017 and sustained negative FCF in the medium term. Continuing weak business prospects would place considerable pressure on GATE to meet its interest commitments in August 2017. Access to external financing is also limited; it had only USD11.5 million of undrawn credit and banking facilities available for working-capital purposes as at end-March 2017.

Brait, which also owns gym chain Virgin Active and British supermarket Iceland Foods, said NAV totalled 39.5 billion rand($3.45 billion), or 78.15 rand per share in the year to end March. That was down from 70 billion rand, or 136.3 cents a year earlier. NAV is a performance measure for investment companies that reflects the value of underlying assets excluding liabilities. Brait has been under pressure in recent months as a weaker British pound eat into earnings measured in rand while weak consumer demand and tough competition in the UK' high street has weighed on one of its biggest profit sources, New Look. Brait slashed the carrying value of its New Look, which competes with the River Island and H&M;, by about 80 percent to 7.1 billion rand. That means New Look's contribution to Brait's group NAV fell to 15 percent from about 45 percent a year earlier.

On Monday, euro zone government bond yields dropped as the first round of French parliamentary elections pointed to a landslide for President Emmanuel Macron's party while Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement suffered in mayoral elections. But while political risks may have diminished in southern Europe, political uncertainty persists in some countries in the north.  We have had some major political news in Europe in the last few days, and though the French and Italian news has been much more in focus, we also have some negative news from other parts,  said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz.  In the Netherlands, the second attempt to build a coalition failed and in Finland there is a possibility of snap elections.  Euro zone bond yields rose 1-2 basis points across the board on Tuesday. The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond , the benchmark for the region, was up 1.6 basis points at 0.27 percent. Dutch government bonds are normally slow to react to political concerns, given the country's triple-A rating and economic and fiscal strength. But the Dutch 10-year bond yield spread over Germany hovered near one-year highs of 22 bps ahead of an auction of 10-year government bonds. Dutch political parties have struggled to form a government since a general election in March. Finnish 10-year bond yields rose 2 bps to 0.345 percent, following news that Prime Minister Juha Sipila will break up his three-party coalition, saying he wanted to eject the nationalist Finns Party. The  transatlantic spread  between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs were close to one-month highs at 195 bps as U.S. ratesetters were set to begin a two-day meeting later on Tuesday. Expectations are for the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday and to potentially provide more detail on its plans to shrink the mammoth bond portfolio it amassed to nurse the economic recovery. Elsewhere, euro zone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund are likely to strike a compromise on Greece on Thursday, paving the way for new loans for Athens while leaving the contentious debt relief issue for later, officials said.

Connecting with Android Pay will enable WorldRemit customers in developed markets like Europe or North America to make instant international money transfers to reach the 112 million accounts available via WorldRemit's network of payment channels.  London-based WorldRemit says it handles about three-quarters of mobile phone-based international money transfers, a small but fast-growing segment of the global $575 billion worldwide remittance market. Recipients using WorldRemit can up pick cash or deposit money in banks or mobile money accounts or top up mobile accounts.  Android Pay is a secure way for smartphone users to store credit, debit or loyalty cards to make payments online or in stores which Google has set up in about 15 of the world's most advanced markets since launching it two years ago. In effect, smartphone users where Android Pay is available will have a simple and secure way to make money transfers to the 125 countries where WorldRemit operates. A 3D printed Android logo is seen in front of a displayed cyber code in this illustration taken March 22, 2016.Dado Ruvic/Illustration Our customers often complete money transfer transactions while talking to family or friends on WhatsApp,  WorldRemit Chief Executive Ismail Ahmed said in an interview last week at the MoneyConf financial technology conference in Madrid.  Anything we can do to simplify that process is a big thing for us.  Ahmed, a former United Nations development advisor from Somaliland, set up WorldRemit in 2010 and has raised nearly $150 million in equity funding from venture firms including Accel and TCV and another $45 million in debt financing. Once Android Pay is set up, transfers can be done in five clicks via the WorldRemit service, the company said. Using this route, customers no longer have to re-enter credit card details or pass additional security tests that can derail transactions. The cost of transfers via Android Pay are in line with other credit or debit card processing fees it charges - normally well under 5 percent - WorldRemit said.   WorldRemit makes money by charging basic handling fees and a small mark-up on foreign exchange rates, which typically undercut rates charged by traditional, agent-based transfer firms like Western Union and MoneyGram. Online payments firm PayPal began offering Android Pay to U.S. customers for domestic shopping or other transactions in April, but has not expanded internationally.

Capita, which specialises in providing IT-enabled business services to banks and investors, the National Health Service, retailers and utilities, said on Tuesday it was making progress finding a new chief executive to replace Andy Parker, who leaves in September. It added that the disposal of its asset services business was still on track for the second half of the year. Both are seen as key to future performance after the company was hit by clients delaying major deals in the wake of Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Shares were up 14 percent at 0840 GMT at 629 pence compared with a little-changed blue chip FTSE index. Credit Suisse said the statement was  broadly positive . The overall picture is still mixed for the group, analysts said, but the fact that current forecasts were unchanged and there was no fresh negative news boosted the shares. While Capita's profitability is recovering in its IT Services division and it is seeing better trading in Germany and Switzerland, its property, employee benefits and learning services operations have yet to improve.  As previously stated, Capita expects 2017 will be a transitional year for the group,  it said.  Tough conditions continue from the hiatus in the public sector,  said Robin Speakman, analyst at Shore Capital, adding that he still saw risks that forecasts could be downgraded. The group also mentioned the potential early termination of a Ministry of Defence contract which could be retendered and become less profitable. In March, it announced a bigger-than-expected drop in profits and said it would take until 2018 before it could return to growth. Capita is trying to become  leaner and simpler , after years in which acquisitions were the main driver of revenue growth and its structure was considered by many analysts to have become unwieldy.

The nominee to lead the Unification Ministry, Cho Myoung-gyon, has deep understanding of the new administration's North Korea policy and the issues facing the two Koreas, the presidential office said. Moon wants to engage North Korea in dialogue and revive stalled exchanges with the reclusive country including economic cooperation projects, saying sanctions alone have failed to rein in North Korea's accelerating development of weapons. But the overture for warmer ties with North Korea has been complicated by its defiance. North Korea, which tested nuclear devices twice last year, has conducted missile tests four times since Moon's election in May. Cho's appointment does not need parliament's approval but he must attend a hearing and answer questions from lawmakers. Cho spent much of his career at the Unification Ministry, which handles North Korea ties, and was involved in preparing a 2007 summit between leaders of the two Koreas. Cho also oversaw South Korea's economic cooperation projects with the North, including a jointly run industrial complex in Kaesong, just north of the border.  South Korea's former conservative government closed the industrial zone in February 2016 after North Korea tested a long-range rocket in defiance of international sanctions. Under leader Kim Jong Un, the North has been conducting missile tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the mainland United States. Later on Tuesday, Moon appointed Kim Sang-jo, a corporate reform activist, as chairman of the Korea Fair Trade Commission. Kim has been nicknamed the  chaebol sniper  for his shareholder activist campaigns against the large family-run conglomerates known as chaebol. The commission handles business regulations and is tasked with investigating the conglomerates’ business practices, and with cracking down on any unfair dealings such as the funneling of contracts to affiliates. Kim’s nomination was seen as reflection of Moon’s commitment to reform the chaebols, which dominate Asia’s fourth biggest economy, in the wake of a corruption scandal that led to the ouster of his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, and the bribery trial of Samsung Group leader Jay Y. Lee. Both Park and Lee have denied wrongdoing.

Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the issue during Kern's visit to an economic forum in St Petersburg this month, Der Standard said, citing insiders.  OMV and Gazprom had signed an outline deal in the Russian city to coordinate  the development of the gas transmission infrastructure required for providing natural gas supplies to central and southeastern Europe . A source familiar with the plans told Reuters it was too early to talk about project costs and investments. If realized, the project would likely boost the importance of OMV's Baumgarten gas hub, which distributes around 57 billion cubic meters a year. Der Standard said the project would be an extension of the TurkStream pipeline, which Gazprom plans to finish by the end of 2019. The extended line could pump Russian gas to Italy, which currently receives supplies from Baumgarten via the TAG and SOL pipelines. Alternatively, Russian gas could go from western Turkey via Greece to Italy.  Spokesmen for OMV and Kern declined to comment. Gazprom had no immediate comment. Russia scrapped the South Stream pipeline project, which would have supplied Russian gas to southern Europe with an undersea pipeline to Bulgaria, in late 2014 because of objections from the European Union on competition grounds. The dispute between Brussels and Moscow followed Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and the imposition of Western economic sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine conflict.

The transactions are backed by pools of Australian conforming residential mortgages originated by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited (A-/Stable/F2). A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this Ratings Action Commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations reflect Fitch's view that available credit enhancement (CE) supports the notes' current ratings, the agency's expectations for Australia's economic conditions, and that the credit quality and performance of the loans in the collateral pools have remained within the agency's expectations. As per Fitch's APAC Residential Mortgage criteria, the default model was not run for TORRENS Series 2014-1 Trust, as a review of pre-determined performance triggers indicates that the transaction displays stable asset performance. The default model was run for the two remaining transactions. The available CE of the rated notes for TORRENS Series Trust 2014-2 has increased for the class B and C notes. However, they are constrained by concentration and are sensitive to deterioration in recovery rates. We expect the transactions to switch to pro-rata, ending the CE build-up. All loans in the underlying portfolios have lenders' mortgage insurance (LMI) in place, provided mainly by QBE Lenders Mortgage Insurance Limited (Insurer Financial Strength Rating: AA-/Stable) and Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Limited (Insurer Financial Strength Rating: A+/Stable). Losses have remained low since closing, with just one loss of AUD164,381 in TORRENS 2014-1 for which 99.8% was covered by LMI. RATING SENSITIVITIES Initial sequential pay-down has resulted in an increase in CE for the senior notes of all transactions, with the rated notes able to withstand multiples of the latest reported arrears. We do not expect the ratings to be affected by modest changes in performance. The class A notes of TORRENS 2014-1, class A and AB notes of TORRENS 2014-2, and class A1 and A2 of TORRENS Series 2017-1 Trust are independent of downgrades to the LMI provider's ratings. The remaining notes of TORRENS 2014-2 and 2017-1 are LMI dependent. USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it has received about the performance of the asset pools and the transactions. There were no findings that were material to this analysis. Fitch has not reviewed the results of any third-party assessment of the asset portfolio as part of our ongoing monitoring. We conducted a file review of a small targeted sample of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited's origination files, and found the information to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset-pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis - according to our applicable rating methodologies - indicates that it is adequately reliable. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis: Loan-by-loan data provided by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited as of 30 April 2017 Transaction reporting data provided by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited as of 30 April 2017 Loan-enforcement details provided by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited as of 30 April 2017 The issuer has informed Fitch that not all relevant underlying information used in the analysis of the rated notes is public.

In trials with customers, aerial drones and robots are able to move around and inside remote or dangerous facilities while photographing corrosion or taking temperature, vibration or gas readings that can be analyzed by computer algorithms and artificial intelligence, Alex Tepper, head of business development at Avitas Systems, a startup GE formed for this business, told Reuters. GE is expected to announce the new business, which is focused on the oil and gas, transportation and power sectors, as early as Tuesday at a conference in Berlin, Germany. GE is not the first to combine artificial intelligence with robots to inspect industrial facilities or processes. IBM Corp said it has been working on systems connected to its Watson artificial intelligence capability for about a year and launched some projects March.  Tests IBM have been conducting include coupling cameras to Watson so they can recognize defects in electronic components zipping through assembly lines in China and Taiwan. Other projects involve acoustic sensors, or training Watson-enabled drones to spot frayed power lines on remote electrical towers. IBM and partner ABB Ltd, the Swedish-Swiss conglomerate, are combining visual inspection with ABB robots.   This is one of the hottest areas within IoT (Internet of Things) manufacturing,  said Bret Greenstein, vice president of IBM Watson internet of things. He declined to cite a potential market size. GE said its Avitas business will combine computer analytics and artificial intelligence with its knowledge of the industrial systems it builds and its existing inspection business.  We know this equipment very well so we can program the robots, regardless of type, to gather the information we need for an inspection,  Tepper said.  Companies spend about $40 billion annually inspecting plants and equipment within the oil and gas, transportation and power generation sectors, Tepper said. He expects robots will not replace humans, but will extend their reach and lower costs.  Automated crawlers and drones also address shifting demographics. Many inspection engineers are nearing retirement, and few young workers are interested in the field, he said.

Coming under administration could, however, help Ten by allowing it to freeze and then renegotiate expensive licensing contracts with U.S. studios for shows such as NCIS and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Broadcasters and Ten in particular have suffered large losses and are scrambling to cut costs as advertisers follow viewers who have turned to streaming services like Netflix (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) Amazon Prime.  Going into receivership, they can be very tough in their renegotiation, and more realistic,  said Steve Allen, managing director of Essence Media.  The programs and the ratings that they're getting for the costs involved is a mismatch; it wasn't five years ago, but it is now.   Ten had flagged in April that it might collapse if it did not extend or secure a new borrowing arrangement, adding that it was looking to increase the size of its current facility from A$200 million ($150 million) to A$250 million. The current facility is backed by three Australian tycoons. On Tuesday, Ten said that it had been informed that two of them, News Corp (NWSA.O) co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch and regional TV owner Bruce Gordon would not be extending their support beyond Dec. 23, 2017. It was not immediately clear if Crown Resorts (CWN.AX) casino boss James Packer had also withdrawn his support. A representative for Packer was not immediately available for comment. Ten's situation puts pressure on the Australian government to push through a deregulation package that would make it easier for local traditional media companies to buy each other. Lachlan Murdoch owns 7.7 percent of Ten and News Corp-controlled local cable TV firm Foxtel owns another 14 percent. Analysts have said they expect Foxtel would be interested in buying out Ten if the deregulation package went through. The package has wide support in the media industry but some  independent senators, who control the Australian upper house, have said they are concerned the diversity of local content could suffer. While receivership could be a good opportunity for Ten to break onerous contracts, it is not without risk as the network could lose some good shows, said Laurie Fitzgerald, a business recovery specialist at corporate adviser William Buck.  The MasterChef group...they could just turn around to Ten and say: you've broken our contract, we'll shop it around, we might just see what Nine will offer us,  said Fitzgerald. Ten also said it had asked to have its shares suspended for two days while it considers its position in light of the stance taken by its backers.  Up to Friday's close, Ten's shares had plunged 83 percent this year, giving it a market value of A$58 million. In 2014, it rejected a $588 million takeover bid from Time Warner.

The financial industry has warned that forced  relocation  would split markets, bump up trading costs and diminish the status of the euro - as well as threaten thousands of jobs in the City of London. The draft law due to be published later on Tuesday would, as a last resort, force euro-denominated clearing business to shift from London to the bloc if the volume was deemed by Brussels to be systemically important, the source said. The bulk of clearing in euro-denominated derivatives is done in London, and involves a third party standing between two sides of a trade to ensure its smooth and safe completion. The European Central Bank and euro zone policymakers have long wanted control over euro clearing, saying it is core to the single currency area's financial stability and would be outside the EU's regulatory sphere once Britain leaves the bloc in 2019. Under the draft law, if ESMA decides that a non-EU clearer is handling  systemically  important volumes of euro denominated business, a system of  enhanced supervision  would be introduced, the source said. This would mimic how U.S. regulators already have direct oversight of clearing houses in London that clear dollar-denominated instruments, such as having direct access to sensitive data. The first aim of the law is to centralise supervision of EU based clearing houses, with the bloc's European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) taking the lead, backed by central banks such as the ECB. At present, national supervisors oversee clearers. The second builds on the existing system of  equivalence , whereby a non-EU clearer can serve customers in the bloc if it complies with rules that are similar to the EU's.  If enhanced supervision does not work because it is so systemic, then there can be a decision to require relocation. That is a last resort,  the source said. ESMA would have to make a recommendation, with the European Commission taking the final decision on relocation. The European Commission decided not to include any quantitative criteria for  systemic  clearing houses, such as caps on clearing volumes, relying on a  case-by-case  approach by ESMA. The draft law will need approval from EU states and the European Parliament. Most euro-denominated clearing of derivatives is done by a unit of the London Stock Exchange, whose head said on Monday that relocation would have little financial impact as it has a clearing house in Paris that is fully authorised under EU rules. A global derivatives industry body warned on Monday that shifting clearing of euro-denominated derivatives from London to the European continent would require banks to set aside far more cash to insure trades against defaults, a cost that would be passed on to companies. Bank of England officials have warned that euro clearing could shift to New York, but the EU law would mean that if a U.S. clearing house became a  systemic  clearer of euro denominated instruments, it too would come under the new rules. Details of the draft law were first reported by the Financial Times on Monday. (Editing by Alexander Smith)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eu-markets-clearing-idUSL8N1JA17R"},

The exploration and production company will use the money raised in the bond offering to fund development and secure a 5 percent stake in the deep-water project Buckskin in the Gulf of Mexico, which holds an estimated 490 million barrels of recoverable oil, Navitas Chairman Gideon Tadmor said on Tuesday. Upon completion of the bond issuance -- which is aimed at institutional investors and has been graded  A-  by Standard & Poor's Israeli unit Maalot -- Navitas will go public in Tel Aviv, Tadmor said. Navitas' valuation in the IPO will be approximately $100 million, according to a prospectus.  After two and a half years of downturn in the upstream sector, there are very interesting investment opportunities in the sector in the U.S,  Tadmor told Reuters. Tadmor, 53, has been a public face for Israel's energy industry over the past decade as the country emerged as a regional player. He bought Navitas from Israeli conglomerate Delek Group (DLEKG.TA), where he had previously held senior roles, which discovered the massive natural gas fields Tamar and Leviathan.  These discoveries turned Israel into an energy exporter. Drill bits from both wells are displayed in his new offices. Despite the local boom, Navitas, with stakes in 11 oil and gas projects in the Gulf of Mexico and another in Newfoundland, Canada, will be one of the first public Israeli companies to operate abroad.  One of our advantages is our ability to source both equity and financing from the Israeli capital market to cherry pick exciting projects,  Tadmor said. Delek is also looking overseas, acquiring North Sea oil producer Ithaca Energy earlier this month. Israel in the meantime is seeking new firms to explore 24 offshore blocks in the vicinity of Tamar and Leviathan, saying huge reserves have yet to be discovered. Although he championed eastern Mediterranean exploration while at Delek, Tadmor said he did not see opportunities in this round of tenders.  My heart is in Israel, my investors are in Israel, but the opportunities right now in my mind exist outside of Israel,  he said, referring to what he sees as a combination of problematic regulation, the potential for relatively small discoveries, and a limited market to sell the gas.

Masayoshi Amamiya, the BOJ's executive director overseeing monetary policy, told Parliament on Tuesday the pace of bond buying had slowed because U.S. Treasury yields have fallen - enabling the central bank to cap Japanese long-term rates while also reducing its purchases.  The slowdown came as a result of our policy of guiding yields at appropriate levels,  he told parliament, when asked by a ruling party lawmaker why the BOJ's purchases were slowing.  The BOJ will continue to take necessary steps to stabilise prices, while keeping an eye on how they affect its financial health,  he said. After three years of heavy asset buying failed to drive up inflation, the BOJ switched its policy framework last year to one that capped long-term interest rates from a policy that had  targeted the pace of money printing. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has repeatedly said the central bank still had plenty of bonds to buy, and that it was premature to openly debate an exit strategy from the stimulus programme. But buying large amounts of Japanese government bonds is expected to become increasingly difficult as the central bank already owns more than 42 percent of the entire JGB market. Indeed, recent data showed the BOJ's bond buying has slowed considerably in recent months. Most analysts expect the BOJ to slow the pace further to around 60 trillion yen ($546 billion) by the end of year and to omit from its policy statement a loose pledge to increase its JGB holding by 80 trillion yen a year at some point. The fate of the pledge may be among topics the BOJ's nine board members will discuss at their two-day policy meeting that starts on Thursday. With the BOJ now targeting interest rates, many central bank policymakers see the 80-trillion-yen pledge as obsolete and largely symbolic. But some remain wary of removing the pledge now fearing it could be misinterpreted as a sign the BOJ is contemplating withdrawing its stimulus programme at short notice.

The current round of quotas is 49 percent higher than last year's batch, which were all issued under the processing category, of 6.085 million tonnes. The new quotas increased the total number of processing permits to 24.76 million tonnes granted so far in 2017.  The quotas will be valid till the end of this year and were assigned to China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), Sinopec Corp, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) and Sinochem Group, the sources said. The government issued 6.29 million tonnes of exports under the separate general trade category in May, taking the total under that scheme to 7.605 million tonnes for the year. Combined by category, China has granted 32.365 million tonnes of fuel export quotas this year, and all to the same four state oil companies.      The Ministry of Commerce did not immediately comment.  The third round of export quotas rose to accommodate a growing surplus of refined fuel as overall Chinese refinery throughput is set to increase even with possible run cuts by Sinopec, as peak maintenance season ends and new capacity additions are expected later this year, said oil analyst Nevyn Nah of consultancy Energy Aspects.  Even with run cuts, we still have Chinese run (rates) up conservatively by 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) year-on-year in the third quarter,  said Nah. For the latest batch of processing quotas, also called tolling quotas, Sinopec won 5.05 million tonnes, followed by CNPC at 2.7 million tonnes, Sinochem at 700,000 tonnes and CNOOC at 610,000 tonnes. China earlier this year barred the country's independent oil plants from exporting fuel.  Under the general trade category, refiners get tax refunds after exports are completed or get a tax waiver on fuel exports, a policy that Beijing granted in 2016.  Under the processing rules, refiners are exempted from import taxes on crude oil and export taxes for oil products, but have fixed volumes and time slots to export, both under the tight scrutiny of Chinese customs. China's demand for oil products will grow by 360,000 bpd this year, down from the annual demand growth of 550,000 bpd in 2016, said Energy Aspect's Nah.

The nominee to lead the Unification Ministry, Cho Myoung-gyon, has deep understanding of the new administration's North Korea policy and the issues facing the two Koreas, the presidential office said. Moon wants to engage North Korea in dialogue and revive stalled exchanges with the reclusive country including economic cooperation projects, saying sanctions alone have failed to rein in North Korea's accelerating development of weapons. But the overture for warmer ties with North Korea has been complicated by its defiance. North Korea, which tested nuclear devices twice last year, has conducted missile tests four times since Moon's election in May. Cho's appointment does not need parliament's approval but he must attend a hearing and answer questions from lawmakers. Cho spent much of his career at the Unification Ministry, which handles North Korea ties, and was involved in preparing a 2007 summit between leaders of the two Koreas. Cho also oversaw South Korea's economic cooperation projects with the North, including a jointly run industrial complex in Kaesong, just north of the border. South Korea's former conservative government closed the industrial zone in February 2016 after North Korea tested a long-range rocket in defiance of international sanctions. Under leader Kim Jong Un, the North has been conducting missile tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the mainland United States. Later on Tuesday, Moon appointed Kim Sang-jo, a corporate reform activist, as chairman of the Korea Fair Trade Commission. Kim has been nicknamed the  chaebol sniper  for his shareholder activist campaigns against the large family-run conglomerates known as chaebol. The commission handles business regulations and is tasked with investigating the conglomerates’ business practices, and with cracking down on any unfair dealings such as the funnelling of contracts to affiliates. Kim’s nomination was seen as reflection of Moon’s commitment to reform the chaebols, which dominate Asia’s fourth biggest economy, in the wake of a corruption scandal that led to the ouster of his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, and the bribery trial of Samsung Group leader Jay Y. Lee. Both Park and Lee have denied wrongdoing.

That would undermine the impact of supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which partly aimed to force traders holding oil in storage to sell to reduce bloated inventories that have sapped global prices.  Brent crude futures <0#LCO:> for delivery in half a year's time were this week around $1.50 per barrel above current prices, a market structure known as 'contango' that makes it profitable to store fuel instead of selling for direct use. Shipping data shows that at least 15 supertankers are sitting in Southeast Asia's Strait of Malacca and Singapore Strait, filled with unsold fuel.  While that is less than in previous months, traders said that volumes in storage could easily pick up.  If contango lasts, it's very possible that the amount of tankers used for storage rises back to levels seen earlier this year,  said a trader who fixes floating storage deals. He declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with media. High Supply Oil shipments to Asia remain high, stoking the supply glut in the region. Trade data shows that 21.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude came to Asia on tankers in May. While that is down from a peak in February, it is similar to levels in late 2016, before production cuts were announced. OPEC has so far shied away from making significant supply cuts to its biggest customers, most of which are in Asia. And other producers, especially from the United States, have stepped up exports, further stoking the glut. OPEC's de-facto leader Saudi Arabia now says it will cut July crude allocations to Asia by 300,000 bpd, although many Asian refiners so far say they have received all their allocations. Going forward, analysts said that storage levels would be key in determining the health of the oil market.  It's the only statistical proof the market can get to confirm or deny OPEC's claim the market is heading back toward balance,  said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

The Fed is widely expected to hike interest rates during the policy meeting beginning Tuesday, but the focus is on whether the central bank thinks the U.S. economy is robust enough to withstand further rate increases through 2017.                   If they are not hawkish, gold could be stable for a little while because there seems to be a bit too much longs in the market,  said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.     While a rate hike in the meeting is a given, people are waiting to hear if the Fed could raise rates again in September or any other time, Leung noted.     Spot gold        was down 0.1 percent at $1,264.01 per ounce at 0805 GMT. Earlier in the session, it hit a low of $1,262.61, its weakest since June 2.     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery dropped 0.2 percent to $1,266.30.       While the market broadly expects another two hikes in rates in 2017, the tone of the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee meeting) could set the stage for further weakness in the short term,  ANZ bank said in a note.         Higher rates could boost the dollar, making commodities priced in the greenback more expensive for holders of other currencies.      Depending on the central bank's wording, market reaction could be intense and so we would rather watch the action from the sidelines for the time being,  said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir, adding that they remained neutral on gold, heading into the meeting.

Inflation numbers (0830 GMT) are the main set piece after two traumatic days for the pound which saw Prime Minister Theresa May's majority collapse and investors worry that political turmoil would further weaken an already slowing economy. By 0742 GMT, the pound had recovered 0.2 percent from Monday's closing levels in New York to trade at $1.2693, just over half a cent above Friday's intraday lows. Against the euro, it was also 0.2 percent stronger at 88.33 pence, having hit its weakest in seven months on Monday.  Brexit talks will of course dominate the market mood and this morning, amid talk of a cross-party plot to ensure the UK negotiates for a 'softer' Brexit, there's an excuse for some short-covering,  said Societe Generale analyst Kit Juckes.  That's a blip on the road to euro-sterling trading comfortably above 90 pence.  Short covering refers to the closing of existing bets against the currency, typically purely to lock in some gains on such positions after the currency has fallen. Prime Minister Theresa May meets the leader of a small Northern Irish Protestant party (DUP) on Tuesday in an attempt to save her premiership and avoid a second election that would thrust Brexit negotiations, due to start this month, into turmoil. With some calling for her resignation and others describing her as a dead man walking after last week's result, May won some time when she performed well on Monday in front of Conservative lawmakers who said they would help her remain in power for now. But crucial for banks and financial markets are the blow the election has delivered to May's plan for a  hard  Brexit that prioritised immigration controls over membership of the EU's single market. There is no clear evidence of a move on that front among Conservative leaders as yet, although many of the party's more moderate supporters in the media have argued for it. What is clear is that even should May gain the support of the DUP for confidence votes and budgets, she will struggle to legislate normally at a time when the economy badly needs fiscal and policy support.  With Theresa May holding coalition talks and fighting to remain prime minister, but new elections before the end of Brexit negotiations a very real possibility, the market focus remains firmly on politics,  Unicredit analysts said in a morning note.  We expect the pound to slide further over the coming months, with upside risks to our year-end forecast of 89 pence per euro.

A technology sector rout extended to its second trading day on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite on track for its biggest two-day loss since September. The tech selling dragged down all three major indexes, causing concerns of wider bearishness in equities.   We're having a hard time deciding whether it's really a tech-specific sell-off or if this is a valuation pullback, so we're just holding pat right now,  said Scott Goginsky, a co-portfolio manager of the Biondo Growth Fund.  However, investors took comfort that rather than totally abandoning equities, some were rotating into value sectors of the market. Losses were contained by a continuing rebound in energy and bank stocks.   The overall equity market health is reasonably good because people are rotating - they are not frantically getting out of stocks,  said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co.  Up nearly 14 percent since President Donald Trump's inauguration in January, the technology sector of the S&P; 500 .SPLRCT had ballooned to its most expensive since early 2008 in terms of price to earnings expectations. Tech took over the market leadership from financials and other sectors that outperformed after the Nov. 8 presidential election on hopes that Trump's agenda of deregulation and tax cuts would benefit the sector. The five largest U.S. companies by market capitalization, Apple (AAPL.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Facebook (FB.O) added more than $600 billion in market cap in 2017 before the sell-off started, making some analysts wary of sector over-extension. The Technology Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (XLK.P) was down 0.8 percent Monday after having fallen as much as 2.2 percent - on track to post its largest two-day percentage decline in nearly a year. The decline was led by Apple, stung by a broker downgrade for a second straight week on Monday.  Short sellers had already been building their position in Apple since the end of May, according to financial data firm S3, with short interest topping $9 billion for the first time since May of last year. Apple is now the third-largest worldwide short, behind Alibaba Group (BABA.N), with $16.7 billion of short interest, and Tesla Inc(TSLA.O), with $10.5 billion. The tech sell-off  is a reminder that markets that have full valuations are prone to quick reversals,  said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, which oversees more than $1.5 trillion in assets. The recent reversal in technology has given new life to the  value trade,  in which investors bet on large, undervalued companies and seek dividend payments. The iShares S&P; 500 value ETF (IVE.P) is up more than 4 percent over the last two sessions. The fund's top holdings include Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N). At the same time, the technology rout has left some investors finding opportunities to add to their tech holdings at lower prices.  We're not worried at all about tech. We just think it’s a correction and a dip,  said Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of Navellier & Associates , in Reno, Nevada.  Guys like me are net buyers right now… It'll be fine.

With the fall of Mosul imminent, what happens next?  There will be winners, like the Kurds. There will be losers, like Iraq’s Sunni minority. There will be gains for Iran, which backs the Shi’ite militias drafted to fight Sunni-dominated IS. And there may be a silver lining for the Trump administration - specifically in the form of Kurdish independence and permanent American bases in a Shi’ite-ruled Iraq. But any declaration of “victory” on the part of the United States depends on how the measure of those results is taken.  Start with the Kurds. Their military forces currently control a swath of northern territory, including the oil-rich province of Kirkuk. The area has been a functional confederacy since soon after the American invasion of 2003 and in spite of likely opposition from Baghdad, a fully-realized nation-state of Kurdistan seems inevitable. The Kurds certainly think so; they’ll hold an independence referendum on September 25.  Previous U.S. administrations restrained Kurdish ambitions, trying to keep “Iraq” more or less as it was within its 2003 borders. George W. Bush, and to a lesser extent Barack Obama, wished for a unified Iraq as a symbol, the conclusion of the invasion narrative of eliminating Saddam Hussein and establishing a new semi-secular ally in the heart of the Middle East. A unified Iraq that enveloped the Kurds was also sought by NATO ally Turkey, which feared an independent Kurdish state on its disputed eastern border.  MORE FROM REUTERS From ‘caliph’ to fugitive: IS leader Baghdadi’s new life on the run Commentary: UK’s Theresa May is right to stay. For now. Podcast: How the Pentagon’s wasteful budget hurts the military The Trump White House appears less anguished about Kurdish independence; Trump is for the first time, for example, overtly arming pro-Kurdish independence militias, whom the Turks call terrorists, to take on Islamic State. Washington doesn’t seem to have a plan for disarming the militias before they start fighting for control of disputed ancestral Kurdish lands held by Turkey.  So the key question has become not if the Kurds will announce some sort of statehood, but whether the Kurds will go to war with Turkey to round out their territorial claims in the process. The United States, with the ties that previously bound Washington and Ankara weakened following Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's authoritarian crackdown, might just be ready to stand aside and allow Kurdish ambitions to play out. The Kurds are respected in American conservative circles important to Trump, and the Turks have fewer friends than ever there. Kurdish oil will be welcome to Washington, and the Kurds have always championed close security ties with the U.S. A strong U.S.-Kurd alliance will also help Trump keep Iran in check.  U.S. soldiers from the 2nd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division at a military base north of Mosul, Iraq, February 14, 2017.Khalid al MousilyMeanwhile, an Obama-era marriage of practicality which brought Shi’ite militias into the fight against Islamic State will not play out as well for Trump.  Any reluctance on the part of the United States to act as a restraining force on the Iraqi central government's empowering of Shi’ite militias disappeared in 2014. As the Iraqi National Army collapsed in front of Islamic State, the crisis demanded battle-ready forces, and the militias were the only option available outside of Kurdish-controlled areas.  The problem for America is that many of those Shi’ite militias owe significant allegiance to Iran, which helps arm them and supplements their efforts with special forces and leadership. Unlike the post-invasion years of about 2006 forward, when the United States and Iran fought a shadow war for control inside Iraq, America has had to accept that it needs the militias to defeat Islamic State.  Time will tell what Iran will do with its influence in Iraq. But there is certainly nothing for the White House to celebrate in seeing Iranian boots on the same ground where Americans died to hold territory. Or with having to deal with a Baghdad government beholden to Tehran and its Shi’ite militias.  In the Sunni parts of Iraq, there is no real win for the Trump administration. The fight against Islamic State is destroying Mosul, and has already devastated Sunni cities like Ramadi and Fallujah. Neither Washington nor Baghdad has any realistic plans to rebuild.  Yet despite a tangential win alongside the Kurds, and with clear losses vis-vis the Shi’ite and Sunnis, there is perhaps a real silver lining in Iraq for Trump. Permanent American military bases.  Post-Islamic State, Iraq will be a Shi’ite nation with close ties to Iran. The price Iraq and Iran will be forced to pay for America’s reluctant pragmatism over this will likely be small but permanent American military bases inside Iraq, mostly out of sight in the far west. (You won’t laugh if you remember that the U.S. maintained its base at Guantanamo even after it severed ties with Soviet-dominated Cuba.)  Trump is unlikely to give up bases in a rush to declare victory in Iraq, as did his predecessors, and has several thousand American troops already in place to back up his plans. America seeks bases as a symbol of some sort of victory, a way to block any politically-ugly Shi’ite reprisals against the Sunnis, and as a bulwark against whatever happens in Syria. In addition, Israel is likely to near-demand the United States garrison western Iraq as a buffer against expanding Iranian power.  Sealing the deal is that Iran will have little to gain from a fight over some desert estate that it would probably lose anyway, when their prize is the rest of Iraq. Those bases even might, at America's expense, keep any Sunni successors to Islamic State from moving into Iraq - as happened after al Qaeda outstayed its welcome.  While the fight against Islamic State in Iraq isn’t over, an ending of sorts is clear enough to allow for some reasonable predictions. But whatever happens will leave an unanswered, and sadly, perhaps unasked, question: was the outcome worth to Americans the cost of some 4,500 dead, and the trillions of taxpayer dollars spent, over the last 14 years?

The U.S. dollar appeared to be treading water, as traders awaited the start of a two-day meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve for signals on the pace of future monetary tightening. Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said late on Monday that first-quarter growth in the North American country had been  pretty impressive , and that signs economic growth was broadening would lead the central bank to consider whether current low rates would still be required. The comments sent the Canadian dollar - or the  loonie , as it is known by traders - to its highest level in almost two months, with the currency gaining almost 1.5 percent late on Monday and early on Tuesday to trade at C$1.3269 against its U.S. counterpart. While many economists had expected the bank to start raising in 2018, markets were pricing in a 52 percent chance of a hike by the end of 2017 following Wilkins' speech.  The market had been overlooking the strengthening economic data from Canada, and obviously now that we’re starting to see some change in communication from the Bank of Canada to acknowledge that ... the market won’t be able to look through that,  said MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman, in London.  The shift to a more hawkish stance will offer the potential for the Canadian dollar to strengthen further from here.  The U.S. dollar was steady against a broad basket of currencies, while the euro held just above $1.12. With the Fed widely expected to raise interest rates when it concludes its meeting on Wednesday, investors' focus will be on any fresh hints on the pace of hikes in the months to come, and its assessment of the economy and outlook on inflation. Investors will also be watching for any fresh details on the central bank's plans for trimming its balance sheet.  Given that the minutes (of the last Fed meeting) contained lots of details, one possible scenario is that there will be an announcement in June and that it will start in September,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist for Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, referring to the Fed's possible balance sheet reduction. The greenback firmed a little against the yen, trading up 0.2 percent on the day at 110.18 yen. The Bank of Japan holds a policy meeting on Thursday and Friday. Sterling edged up from seven-month lows plumbed the previous day against the euro, though investors were still cautious, viewing the pound as vulnerable to political uncertainty after the shock outcome of last week's elections, in which voters denied any party a parliamentary majority.

While many economists had expected the bank to start raising in 2018, markets were pricing in a 52 percent chance of a hike by the end of 2017 following Wilkins' speech.  The market had been overlooking the strengthening economic data from Canada, and obviously now that we’re starting to see some change in communication from the Bank of Canada to acknowledge that ... the market won’t be able to look through that,  said MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman, in London.  The shift to a more hawkish stance will offer the potential for the Canadian dollar to strengthen further from here.  The U.S. dollar was steady against a broad basket of currencies, while the euro held just above $1.12. With the Fed widely expected to raise interest rates when it concludes its meeting on Wednesday, investors' focus will be on any fresh hints on the pace of hikes in the months to come, and its assessment of the economy and outlook on inflation. Investors will also be watching for any fresh details on the central bank's plans for trimming its balance sheet.  Given that the minutes (of the last Fed meeting) contained lots of details, one possible scenario is that there will be an announcement in June and that it will start in September,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist for Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, referring to the Fed's possible balance sheet reduction. The greenback firmed a little against the yen, trading up 0.2 percent on the day at 110.18 yen. The Bank of Japan holds a policy meeting on Thursday and Friday. Sterling edged up from seven-month lows plumbed the previous day against the euro, though investors were still cautious, viewing the pound as vulnerable to political uncertainty after the shock outcome of last week's elections, in which voters denied any party a parliamentary majority.

The bank said it now expects the gross domestic product to rise 2.1 percent this year, up from a previous forecast of 1.6 percent in March. Last year, GDP grew 1.4 percent. The bank also forecast growth of 1.7 percent for 2018 and 1.4 percent for 2019, compared with previous estimates of 1.5 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively.  Despite the firming up of exports, economic growth in the forecast period will mainly depend on private consumption and investment. Private consumption growth will be bolstered by an improvement in the employment situation and rising purchasing power,  the bank said in a statement. The Finnish economy is recovering from decade-long stagnation following a string of problems, including the decline of Nokia's (NOKIA.HE) former phone business, rigid labor markets and recession in neighboring Russia. The center-right government has cut spending and loosened  labor laws, but the central bank said that more measures were needed to improve conditions for future growth.  The Finnish economy is now embarking on a growth path in a vulnerable condition... The outlook is in any case overshadowed by a growing need for care services for the ageing population in the 2020s,  Governor Erkki Liikanen noted.

Shares of WuXi Biologics popped as much as 39 percent on their debut on Tuesday. High earnings growth and a lack of exciting initial public offerings led to strong demand for the $511 million deal. This is good news for a bourse keen to attract a new breed of entrepreneurs. WuXi helps pharmaceutical firms research, develop and make new drug therapies called biologics. It priced at the top of the range at a valuation of $3 billion. Demand was so strong that the company turned down cornerstone investors and stopped taking orders earlier than planned. And bankers ended up selling 30 percent of the offering to the city's mom and pop investors - three times the typical allocation for retail buyers, Reuters reported. The deal is the city's biggest new listing this year, although it is smaller than the $2.1 billion raised by brokerage Guotai Junan Securities, which already had shares trading on the mainland. The other sizeable IPOs in the former British colony this year have been an uninspiring mix of financial, education, and water- and waste-management outfits. WuXi’s success shows that investors are willing to back fast-growing firms, even if they come with high valuations and novel business models. Earnings at WuXi are expected to top 568 million yuan ($83.6 million) in 2018, up fourfold in two years from an admittedly low base, according to one estimate cited by IFR.  This bodes well for Hong Kong, which wants to diversify away from the stodgy financial, property and industrial groups that dominate the local market. Together, those sectors make up some 60 percent of the Hang Seng Index by market capitalisation. This week, the stock exchange will review proposals for a new board that would allow companies with different voting rights to go public in the city, which is often seen as a way of attracting high-technology firms. Regardless of the outcome, WuXi's strong debut may be potent enough to trigger a reaction from other healthcare and tech bosses.

Hague, Britain's foreign secretary between 2010 and 2014, said this change of strategy would have to take place in the next few weeks before divorce talks with the European Union begin in earnest. Despite her party's expectations of a landslide victory, May lost her majority in parliament in last week's election, pushing her into rushed talks on a support agreement with a small eurosceptic Northern Irish Protestant party. On Monday a spokesman for May said her original approach to Brexit - which focused on limiting immigration, coupled with a threat to walk away without a deal if necessary - had not changed. But she has come under increasing pressure from lawmakers in her own party to soften her stance. Late on Monday she acknowledged to her members of parliament that a broader consensus is needed around Brexit.  Change the emphasis given to the UK's objectives, with a clear indication that economic growth will have priority over controlling the number of people entering the country for work,  Hague said in a column published by the Daily Telegraph newspaper.  This would show a readiness to accommodate the views of Scottish Conservatives, business organisations and, to some degree, opposition parties, within certain parameters.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate this week due to a tightening labour market and may also provide more detail on its plans to shrink the mammoth bond portfolio it amassed to nurse the economic recovery.     Rising interest rates are expected to shore up the dollar, making dollar-based commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies and dampening demand.          FUNDAMENTALS     * LME COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper fell 0.7 percent to $5733 a tonne by 0726 GMT, extending a small 0.6 percent drop in the previous session.      * TECHNICALS: LME copper has been challenging resistance around the 100-day moving average at $5784 a tonne, having reached $5,832 a tonne on Friday which was its highest since April 10.     * SHFE COPPER: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper fell 1.1 percent to 45830 yuan  ($6,742) a tonne.     * ZINC: Premiums for zinc held in China's bonded zones have surged to $195-205 from $155 last week ZN-BMPBW-SHMET. Signs of supply stress also showed on the ShFE, where front month prices flaring to more than 2000 yuan above the third month futures contract on Monday.      * ZINC: Industry sources said that shorts on the front month SHFE were being forced to cover their positions. Since ShFE accepts mostly Chinese brands for delivery against its front month futures contract, the spillover effect into LME may be limited, they said.      * U.S. ECONOMY: U.S. inflation expectations tumbled last month, with one key measure hitting its lowest level since early 2016, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey that could amplify the central bank's concern over a broad slump in prices.     * CHINA ECONOMY: A small majority of traders in China's financial markets think its central bank will likely raise short-term interest rates this week if the U.S. Federal Reserve hikes its key policy rate, as widely expected, according to a Reuters poll.     * COPPER DEMAND: The growing number of electric vehicles hitting roads is set to fuel a nine-fold increase in copper demand from the sector over the coming decade, according to an industry report on Tuesday.     * WAREHOUSES: French bank Natixis has sued metals broker Marex Spectron for $32 million over alleged fraudulent receipts for nickel stored at warehouses in Asia run by a unit of commodities giant Glencore GLEN.L, a court filing showed.      * ZINC: China is likely to step up imports of refined zinc from May, industry sources said last month, as dwindling global supplies of concentrate hit local output of the metal, used to galvanise steel.     * For the top stories in metals and other news, click         or                         BASE METALS PRICES                  0730 GMT          Three month LME copper                        5736.5  Most active ShFE copper                        45830  Three month LME aluminium                       1885  Most active ShFE aluminium                     13700  Three month LME zinc                          2452.5  Most active ShFE zinc                          20720  Three month LME lead                            2057  Most active ShFE lead                          16820  Three month LME nickel                          8775  Most active ShFE nickel                        72540  Three month LME tin                            19165  Most active ShFE tin                          144850                                                        BASE METALS ARBITRAGE                                 LME/SHFE COPPER             LMESHFCUc3        324.92  LME/SHFE ALUMINIUM          LMESHFALc3        324.92  LME/SHFE ZINC               LMESHFZNc3        734.71  LME/SHFE LEAD               LMESHFPBc3        -145.5                                                     3  LME/SHFE NICKEL             LMESHFNIc3        2273.0                                                     2    ($1 = 6.7975 Chinese yuan renminbi)        (Reporting by Melanie Burton; Editing by Vyas Mohan)       ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-metals-idUSL3N1JA1OK"},

China has been restricting real estate purchases across its cities to keep speculation in check and curb soaring prices, with banks also tightening loans to the sector.  Trading volume and average bids in the property market have been dampened which signals that Beijing's policy to regulate the real estate sector is working,  said Zou Mingdong, Shanghai-based steel manager at Zhongcai Merchants Investment Group. But the city of Shanghai appeared to alter a property policy on Monday following protests over the weekend. The most-active rebar contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed down 3.1 percent at 2,935 yuan ($432) a tonne. That was the steepest daily drop for the construction steel product since May 4. Steel demand is also weak during summer in China, when hot weather in the northern parts of the country and frequent rainfall elsewhere limit construction activity.  Steel prices should fall from current levels by yearend, as the supply additions prove too much for actual demand,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a note. As steel prices slid, so did iron ore, with stocks of the raw material still plentiful in China. The most-traded iron ore on Dalian Commodity Exchange fell 2.9 percent to 418.50 yuan per tonne. Stockpiles of imported iron ore at China's ports reached 140.05 million tonnes on Friday, the most since at least 2004, according to data tracked by SteelHome consultancy. SH-TOT-IRONINV Port inventory has risen more than 26 percent this year.  High iron ore inventory will become a regular situation,  said Zou. Iron ore for delivery to China's Qingdao port .IO62-CNO=MB rose 0.9 percent to $54.87 a tonne on Monday, according to Metal Bulletin, tracking gains in Chinese iron ore futures in the prior session.

Since Crown disclosed that 18 of its staff were being held in China for unspecified  gambling offences , the company - 48 percent owned by billionaire James Packer - has torn up its strategy of luring Chinese high rollers to the casino hub of Macau, shifting its focus back home. But the fate of the marketing staff held in China since October remained unclear until Tuesday, when Crown said in a short statement that all its staff caught up in the mass arrest had now been charged with  offences related to the promotion of gambling . It added that Chinese authorities had referred the cases to the Baoshan District Court. That court declined to comment when approached by Reuters. The court's register of upcoming hearings showed a case of 19 defendants, of which the names loosely matched those of some Crown employees, listed for June 26.  Everybody is hoping for a light sentence,  said a family member of one of the Crown staff, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The person added that lawyers for the Crown staff received notice of the charges last week, and had previously notified the staff they faced prison sentences of up to three years.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it  continues to provide consular assistance to three Australian Crown employees detained in Shanghai . Crown last month sold its remaining stake in Macau-focused Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd for $1.16 billion, ending a fraught offshore expansion and freeing up cash for new projects at home.

David Green at Newpage Consulting, which specializes in gambling regulation, said Crown's Australian business may be hurt by a conviction of its staff in China.  If there has been a governance failure at Crown which led to employees being put in harm's way, there is a prospect that the licence review may not be the formality it has been in recent times,  Green said. Crown has casinos and hotels in Melbourne and Perth, and a casino and high-end hotel development in Sydney.

In total, 2,865 Britons took German citizenship last year, the office said. The rise is likely to be far greater this year as it takes several months to obtain a German passport.  The link to Brexit seems clear,  said the Office. Some Britons may be concerned that Britain will make a hard Brexit, leaving it outside the single market and with limited freedom of movement in the bloc. Britain is due to leave the European Union in 2019, but last week's election disaster for Theresa May, who remains Prime Minister but without an overall majority in parliament, has raised questions over what kind of a Brexit deal will be agreed. The Office said a total of 110,400 foreigners took up German citizenship last year, a 2.9 percent increase from the previous year, with the biggest rate of rise among Britons. The largest group of people taking up German citizenship came from Turkey although the total of 16,290 was down 17.3 percent from last year.

Crest, which reported a 5 percent rise in first-half pretax profit to 76.2 million pounds ($97 million), saw its share price fall sharply last week, along with its peers, after Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly failed to win a majority.  The outcome of the UK General Election may introduce some uncertainty in the short term but we expect the new build housing market to remain robust,  said Chief Executive Stephen Stone. Crest, which operates in London, southern and eastern England and south Wales, also reported forward sales stood at 540 million pounds by mid-June, 4 percent ahead of last year. But like many companies in the construction sector, Crest relies on foreign labour, especially on sites in the capital and southern England, with concerns that Brexit could result in strict curbs on immigration. With policy makers seeking to boost housing supply to tackle a growing crisis which has left many younger people spending up to half of their income on rent and struggling to buy a home, Crest said it was crucial that EU citizens can continue to come to Britain.  They're critical to any hopes of delivering increased housing supply,  Chief Operating Officer Patrick Bergin told Reuters.  For the time being, we need to ensure that flow of labour continues.

Since Crown disclosed that 18 of its staff were being held in China for unspecified  gambling offences , the company - 48 percent owned by billionaire James Packer - has torn up its strategy of luring Chinese high rollers to the casino hub of Macau, shifting its focus back home. But the fate of the marketing staff held in China since October remained unclear until Tuesday, when Crown said in a short statement that all its staff caught up in the mass arrest had now been charged with  offences related to the promotion of gambling . It added that Chinese authorities had referred the cases to the Baoshan District Court. That court declined to comment when approached by Reuters. The court's register of upcoming hearings showed a case of 19 defendants, of which the names loosely matched those of some Crown employees, listed for June 26.  Everybody is hoping for a light sentence,  said a family member of one of the Crown staff, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The person added that lawyers for the Crown staff received notice of the charges last week, and had previously notified the staff they faced prison sentences of up to three years. The logo of Australian casino giant Crown Resorts Ltd adorns the hotel and casino complex in Melbourne, Australia, June 13, 2017.Jason ReedCrown did not respond to requests for comment about the exact number of staff who were charged, the specific charges or possible punishment. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop also did not respond to a request for comment. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it  continues to provide consular assistance to three Australian Crown employees detained in Shanghai . Crown last month sold its remaining stake in Macau-focused Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd for $1.16 billion, ending a fraught offshore expansion and freeing up cash for new projects at home. Slideshow (5 Images)The company has been retreating from a decade-long foray into Macau, a southern Chinese territory and global gaming hub, since 18 staff including its head of international VIP sales were arrested for  gambling crimes  in China. David Green at Newpage Consulting, which specializes in gambling regulation, said Crown's Australian business may be hurt by a conviction of its staff in China.  If there has been a governance failure at Crown which led to employees being put in harm's way, there is a prospect that the licence review may not be the formality it has been in recent times,  Green said. Crown has casinos and hotels in Melbourne and Perth, and a casino and high-end hotel development in Sydney.

As dawn broke on Tuesday, five police officers and five Christian civilians dashed across the town's commercial district, ducking for cover from a sniper, to reach a government-controlled area on the Agus River western bank.  We ran the last part,  First Officer Lumna Lidasan, 44, told Reuters, indicating on a map a stretch of seven city blocks that leads to Banggolo bridge.  We could see the bridge ahead of us. We had to take cover several times when we saw a sniper.  Almost the entire population of more than 200,000 fled after May 23, when fighters from local groups allied to Islamic State and a few dozen from other countries rampaged through the Muslim-majority town, killing and kidnapping Christians. The military estimates that, as the siege enters its fourth week, 300-600 civilians are still trapped or being held as human shields in neighborhoods occupied by the militants. The insurgents – with skilled snipers, rocket-propelled grenades and high-velocity assault weapons, according to Philippine army officials - have repelled a sustained push by the military to retake the town. Those stuck in their homes have no running water or electricity and many are near starvation, said Zia Alonto Adiong, a local politician managing rescue and relief efforts. He said that in a text message pleading for help, one family said they had  started to eat their blankets .  They are crossing the bridge, taking the risk, because they don't have any option - either they die inside the house or they die getting out,  he told reporters on Monday. At least 100 people have made their way out on foot, braving volleys of sniper fire, said Adiong. Others have swum across the river or townside lake to safety, according to relief workers. Doctors treating those who escaped say they have been struck by the resilience of people who spent weeks surviving in a conflict zone and witnessing horrific violence.  Some of the stories that stuck were Muslims helping protect Christian workers by letting them borrow a hijab,  said Dr. Gioia Ancheta, head of the psychosocial therapy team.  They Will Kill Them  As they approached the bridge on Tuesday morning, officer Lidasan could see troops waiting on the other side.  Terrified, but realizing there was no turning back, the police officers and the Christians they had protected for three weeks, raced across the 25-metre stretch with no cover from snipers nesting in the town's tall buildings.  We don't think about ourselves, we think about the safety of the civilians,  said Lidasan, tears welling in his eyes as he recounted the story to reporters later. Of the five Christians, who were in Marawi on a construction job when the crisis began, one was shot in the leg by sniper fire on Monday night as the group began their escape. Others were injured by cement kicked up by bullets.  We crawled because snipers were shooting at us. I was wounded by splinters of cement hit by sniper bullets,  said Mateo Velasquez, 33.  My belt bag was hit by a bullet. I thank the money, the coins hit by the bullet.  The 10 men had been trapped since the siege began in a bungalow with its own cellar. They had basic supplies of dried noodles, canned goods and rice, but had to make a regular  suicide mission  to find water, said Lidasan. Militants patrolled nearby but they managed to stay hidden until they made their dash for freedom. Most of those in a larger group of 18 civilians were not so lucky, according to a report from the military on Tuesday. Militants knocked on the door of a house where they were hunkered down, prompting them all to flee through the back door and head towards the river.  The terrorists ran after them and indiscriminately fired at them, killing five of the civilians and taking the remaining eight as hostages,  it said.

Although the possibility of the ruling Conservatives seeking to keep some British access to the European Union's single market has increased, so too has the likelihood of a chaotic departure from the bloc, executives said, meaning they have to plan for the worst.  When the facts change, I'll change my mind,  said Keith Skeoch, chief executive of Scottish insurer and asset manager Standard Life, borrowing a quote from economist John Maynard Keynes.  Until then, I think you continue to plan for a hard Brexit, until you can see evidence of that beginning to shift and change,  he told Reuters. Large global banks in London plan to move about 9,000 jobs in the next two years to financial centres that will stay in the EU, including Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin, so they can continue selling their services across the bloc after Brexit, according to a Reuters' tally of job warnings. The Conservatives' major setback in the general election last week has deepened uncertainty over Prime Minister Theresa May's plans for Brexit, including a departure from the European customs union as well as the single market, and a focus on controlling immigration. May's authority has been weakened after her gamble in calling an early election backfired, leaving her increasingly dependent on fellow Conservatives who object to her plan for a clean break from the EU. Some of May's cabinet colleagues and other senior party members are urging her to change direction. Conservatives in Scotland, which voted heavily to remain in the EU last year, are pushing for May to move the focus of Brexit talks due to start next week onto achieving economic growth and away from immigration, sources in the Scottish party told Reuters. Scottish Conservatives sharply increased their representation in the Westminster parliament last week, in contrast to the party's losses in England, strengthening the influence of their leader Ruth Davidson within the party. Foolish to Hold Off Brexit Minister David Davis said on Monday that the minority government still plans to take Britain out of the single market, noting that most Britons voted for either the Conservative or Labour parties which both said they back such an exit. Miles Celic, the chief executive of TheCityUK, Britain's most powerful financial lobby group, said the comments indicated the government plans to continue with its current strategy and that it retains a parliamentary majority to leave the EU.  What we have not seen over recent days is any concrete or firm shift in the expectations that we've got regarding timescale,  he said. An executive at one international bank warned that because the negotiating clock is now ticking there is now a higher likelihood that the government will fail to get a deal altogether by the March 2019 deadline.  You could argue that with the government in minority now, its leadership credibility shot to pieces, there's almost a higher probability of no deal,  the executive said.  We would be foolish to hold off on our plans.  A government relations official at another bank said the financial industry will still make a renewed attempt to lobby the government to secure more access to the single market, a staggered exit from the EU and more relaxed immigration controls. The official expected the blow to May's authority to increase the power of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, benefiting business. British newspapers had previously reported a rift between May and Hammond and that she had planned to sack him after the election if she had won a larger majority.  Hammond is a pragmatist, he is business-friendly and the Treasury have done all the serious work on Brexit,  the official said.  The door will be a lot more open now than it used to be, and that can only be a good thing.  Rishi Khosla, the chief executive of OakNorth Bank, said the uncertainty around the minority government will hurt the economy for the next couple of years, but in the end it will be a better result for Britain.  In the short term, individuals and businesses are likely to suffer because of the instability of the government,  he said. However, he added:  It is a great opportunity to reposition after what proved to be an unpopular campaign strategy to come up with something more pragmatic, business-friendly and Europe-friendly.

MVP!  it was for their own Mike Trout. But with the Los Angeles Angels center fielder and defending American League MVP relegated to the bench as he recovers from surgery on his thumb, the locals apparently have found a new favorite. New York Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge heard the MVP chants from the heavy Yankee fan contingent on Monday night, particularly after his two-run home run in the eighth inning snapped a 3-3 tie and lifted the Yankees to a 5-3 win.  I wasn't really thinking about it, to be honest,  Judge said of the MVP chants.  I was focused on the game at hand. It was a close game, so I didn't think about it.  The home run off Angels reliever Bud Norris was Judge's major league-leading 22nd of the season, but it didn't have to happen. The Yankees had Aaron Hicks on second base (double) with one out. But instead of walking Judge intentionally and taking their chances with Matt Holliday, the Angels pitched to Judge. Norris fell behind in the count 2-0 before grooving a 91-mph cut fastball over the middle of the plate and Judge hammered it at least 10 rows into the seats in right-center field. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at AngelsNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatch There was, yeah,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said when asked if there was consideration given to walking Judge.  With a base open and Bud being able to move the ball and spin it, you're hoping you can get (Judge) to expand a little bit.  Every hitter's got some holes and you're hoping that Bud can get to it. Unfortunately, the cutter wasn't where it needed to be. I liked the fact that there was an open base where he had a chance to maybe expand, and also you got a tough middle (of the lineup) coming up.  Judge struck out in his first two at-bats of the game, then walked and singled before coming up in the eighth. But he said he wasn't surprised the Angels decided against putting him on base.  No, I was getting ready to hit, and I expected them to (pitch to him),  Judge said.  We have Matt Holliday behind me, then (Starlin) Castro, we've got a good lineup.  While Judge is hitting tape-measure home runs and getting late night talk show appearances, Didi Gregorius is putting together a nice little season of his own. The Yankees shortstop extended his career-best hitting streak to 14 games with four hits. He drove in the Yankees' first two runs with two-out, RBI singles in the third and fifth innings. And when he came to bat with a runner in scoring position and two outs in the seventh, the Angels walked him intentionally. The move backfired as Chase Headley followed with an RBI single to put New York up 3-1. The Yankees got a welcomed performance from starting pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, who entered the game 0-5 with a 10.72 ERA in his last five starts. Yankees manager Joe Girardi was concerned enough to push Tanaka back a day in the rotation to give him an extra day of rest. Tanaka responded with six strong innings, before the Angels knocked him out of the game in the seventh. Tanaka, who got a no-decision, gave up three runs (one earned) and four hits in 6 2/3 innings. He took a 3-1 lead into the seventh, but an error by third baseman Headley prevented Tanaka from a 1-2-3 inning. Instead, the inning was extended and Danny Espinosa's two-out, RBI single knocked Tanaka out of the game. Cameron Maybin followed with an RBI double off Tyler Clippard to tie the game at 3-3, with the run being charged to Tanaka. Clippard (1-3) got the victory over Jose Alvarez (0-3). Dellin Betances got the final four outs for his sixth save. Angels starter Alex Meyer gave up two runs and five hits but lasted only 4 2/3 innings, his outing abbreviated because of five walks and a high pitch count (93).  Just when it looks like he's on the verge of getting over that hump and finding it, much like a lot of power pitchers, he just was not able to get back in that zone and make some pitches,  Scioscia said.  They had a lot of traffic early, he almost got out of some stuff, but 4 2/3 innings and 90-something pitches, that's a lot of work, that's a heavy day.  Kole Calhoun homered for the Angels. NOTES: Yankees RF Aaron Judge was named the American League Player of the Week for the week ending June 11. Judge hit .500 (12-for-24) with three homers, six RBIs, three doubles and 10 runs scored in six games.  If the MVP were voted on today, he'd win that, too,  Yankees OF Brett Gardner told mlb.com. ... The Yankees selected RHP Clarke Schmidt in the first round of Monday's draft, the 16th player picked overall. Schmidt, 21, was 4-2 with a 1.34 ERA while holding opponents to a .194 average at the University of South Carolina before undergoing Tommy John surgery in April. ... The Angels selected OF Jordon  Jo  Adell in the first round of Monday's draft, the 10th player picked overall. Adell, 18, hit .562 with 25 homers, 61 RBIs, 22 stolen bases and 53 runs scored in his senior season at Ballard High School in Louisville, Ky. ... Yankees RHP Ben Heller was called up from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Heller was 2-3 with a 2.60 ERA in 20 relief appearances for the RailRiders this season. RHP Domingo German was optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to make room on the roster for Heller.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED6DH3FU4Y"},

May's botched election gamble cost her Conservative Party its majority in the 650-seat parliament last week, weakening her hand just days before talks with the European Union on a divorce that has to be agreed before an exit due in March 2019. With her authority diminished, May won some time when she performed well on Monday in front of Conservative lawmakers who said they would help her remain in power, at least for now.  She said 'I'm the person who got us into this mess and I'm the one who is going to get us out of it',  said one Conservative lawmaker who attended the meeting.  She said she will serve us as long as we want her.  But to stay in government, May must strike a deal with a small eurosceptic Northern Irish party with 10 parliamentary seats, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). May will meet DUP leader Arlene Foster in London on Tuesday but will face demands from the DUP for more money for Northern Ireland.  We enter these talks in a positive fashion, we are first and foremost unionists and therefore we want to secure the union,  Foster told Sky News.  But we do want to do so in the national interest to give stability to the government and that's why we will be entering these negotiations,  she said. While a deal with the DUP would help May stay in power to open Brexit talks that are due to begin next week, it would also risk destabilising the political balance in Northern Ireland by increasing the influence of pro-British unionists. The unionists have struggled for years with Irish Catholic nationalists who want Northern Ireland to join a united Ireland. While the DUP are deeply eurosceptic, they have balked at some of the practical implications of a so-call hard Brexit -- including a potential loss of a  frictionless border  with the Republic of Ireland -- and talks will touch on efforts to minimise the potential damage to Northern Ireland. With formal EU divorce talks due next week, May heads to France on Tuesday, possibly to bask in the popularity of Emmanuel Macron, who last month swept to victory in a presidential contest. British officials held  talks about talks  with the European Union's Brexit man in Brussels but actual negotiations, scheduled to start in a week's time, might be delayed by political upheaval in London. May's spokesman said the prime minister, who in March set Britain on a two-year countdown to leaving the EU that included a clean break with the bloc's single market and customs union, was not changing her position on what she wants from Brussels.

The 35-year-old was ruled out for six months last year as he recovered from a knee injury but made a winning return this season at the Australian Open, Indian Wells and Miami before opting out of the entire clay-court season. The former world number one is eager to get back to competition in 2017 after a 10-week layoff.   There are no more breaks now,  Federer told the ATP's official website (atpworldtour.com)   I've had enough breaks. I'm a practice world champion now and that's not who I want to be. I want to be a champ on the match courts.   So I'm going to be playing a regular schedule for the second part of the season... And this is the beginning here at the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart.  During Federer's absence, Rafa Nadal won four clay tournaments, culminating in Sunday's French Open victory, and Federer said the Spaniard could finish the year on top of the world rankings.

The company, which hires out diggers and tools on short-term contracts, said underlying pretax profit at constant currency rose to 793.4 million pounds ($1.01 billion) in the year to April 30, from 645.3 million pounds a year ago. Underlying rental revenue at constant currency gained 13 percent to 2.90 billion pounds.  Looking forward, our markets remain good and spring has seen a good seasonal uplift in fleet on rent, with record levels of physical utilisation for this time of year,  Ashtead Chief Executive Geoff Drabble said in a statement. Ashtead has benefited from the rebound in U.S. construction markets and has outperformed peer United Rentals Inc which has greater exposure to the struggling oil and gas sector and in April warned rental rates remained under pressure. The American Rental Association forecast in May that U.S. equipment rental revenue would reach $49.4 billion in 2017, up 4.5 percent over the preceding year.  With the company delivering an in line set of (full-year) results, we expect the market to focus on the long-term upside offered by increased rental penetration in the U.S. market,  Liberum analysts wrote. The brokerage, which has a  buy  rating and a target price of 1,940 pence on the stock, said the firm was well-placed to deliver 9 percent annual underlying revenue growth and further improve its  sector leading  margin. Ashtead said on Tuesday that its end markets remained strong and it continued to see an increasing number of customers opting to rent equipment, allowing greater flexibility. The company, which spent 437 million pounds on bolt-on acquisitions in the year and 48 million pounds on share buybacks, said it continued to execute on its strategy of capturing growth via organic ventures and bolt-on acquisitions.

The biggest mover was the Thai baht, which strengthened 0.3 percent to a near two-year high.      Traders and analysts throughout the region were looking for key information after the two-day Fed meeting that begins later on Wednesday. It has raised rates once so far this year, in March.       We are looking at three rate hikes this year, but investors are not fully priced in for the third one,  said Irene Cheung, ANZ's senior FX strategist for Asia.     The Fed is scheduled to release its decision at 1800 GMT Wednesday. It is widely expected to raise its benchmark due to a tightening labour market and may provide detail on its plans to shrink the bond portfolio it amassed to nurse the U.S. economic recovery.     On Tuesday, the Singapore dollar edged 0.07 percent higher. Data out earlier in the day showed that first-quarter final unemployment in Singapore was 2.2 percent, versus the preliminary 2.3 percent.     The Malaysian ringgit was 0.15 percent higher after a long weekend. Analysts said they believed inflows were keeping it buoyant.     The continuing sell-off in tech stocks in the U.S. kept the Taiwan dollar and South Korean won under pressure, analysts said.     The Taiwan dollar, which has fallen the past five sessions, was down 0.1 percent to its lowest in nearly three weeks.      The South Korean won declined as much as 0.3 percent and hit its lowest in nearly four weeks.     Some traders in South Korea were surprised by comments on Monday by central bank governor Lee Ju-yeol they saw as indicating that monetary policy could be tightened.     But on Tuesday,  Lee clarified that his comment on rate adjustment was not a sign that policy might be tightened soon, and that rates would remain  accommodative .       THAI BAHT     The baht rose to near two-year highs, buoyed by strong current account surplus and portfolio inflows.     Data on Monday also showed that international tourist arrivals in Thailand rose 4.6 percent in May from a year earlier, with revenue up 6.9 percent.     Tourism accounts for 12 percent of Southeast Asia's second-largest economy.

The South Korean automaker said it would also launch an electric version of the sporty-looking Kona next year and a smaller SUV and a large SUV by 2020. This comes at a time when Hyundai looks set to miss its sales target for a third straight year due to the unpopularity of its mainstay small sedans and political tensions between Beijing and Seoul that have battered sales in China, the company's biggest market.  Hyundai, which together with its affiliate Kia (000270.KS) is the world's No.5 automaker, previously sold subcompact SUVs only in emerging markets, missing out on strong growth in the segment in South Korea, the United States and Europe.  The subcompact SUV is the top-performing segment globally, growing at an annual average of 46 percent from 2010 to 2016, Hyundai said, citing IHS Automotive data.        Even as the global SUV market is nearing saturation, we believe that extra small or small SUVs have more room for growth than large SUVs,  Hyundai Motor Co Vice Chairman Chung Eui-sun said during a launch event near Seoul.  The automaker launched the Kona in South Korea on Tuesday, and said it would roll out the small SUV in Europe in August and the United States in December. It aims to sell over 200,000 of the vehicles globally next year.  The Kona will compete with Nissan's (7201.T) Juke, Toyota Motor's (7203.T) C-HR and Renault's (RENA.PA) Captur that is sold as QM3 in South Korea.  Hyundai and Kia in January said they aimed to increase global sales by 5 percent this year, but their combined sales fell 7 percent over January to May, hit by slowing Chinese and U.S. sales.   Our sales plan has suffered a setback, but we will use this as an opportunity to overhaul our products,  said Chung, the only son of Hyundai Motor Group Chairman Chung Mong-koo. He also said Hyundai would accelerate cooperation with technology firms like Cisco (CSCO.O), Baidu (BIDU.O) and Uber [UBER.UL] on connected or self-drivng cars.   Simply making good quality cars is not enough,  Chung said. When asked about overseas acquisitions, Chung said Hyundai currently had no plans to buy other carmakers.

Electric or hybrid cars and buses are expected to reach 27 million by 2027, up from 3 million this year, according to a report by consultancy IDTechEx, commissioned by the International Copper Association (ICA).   Demand for electric vehicles is forecast to increase significantly over the next ten years as technology improves, the price gap with petrol cars is closed and more electric chargers are deployed,  IDTechEx Senior Technology Analyst Franco Gonzalez said in the report.   Our research predicts this increase will raise copper demand for electric cars and buses from 185,000 tonnes in 2017 to 1.74 million tonnes in 2027,  Gonzalez said. Electric vehicles use a substantial amount of copper in their batteries and in the windings and copper rotors used in electric motors. A single car can have up to six kilometers of copper wiring, according to the ICA.  The global market for copper is around 23.9 million tonnes, according to the International Copper Study Group. That suggests electric vehicles could account for about 6 percent of global copper demand in ten years, according to analyst estimates, rising from less than 1 percent this year.  The electric car market is still concentrated in a limited number of countries, according to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) last week.  Globally, 95 percent of electric car sales take place in just ten countries - China, the United States, Japan, Canada, Norway, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden - the IEA said. Still, the IEA expects there is a  good chance  that  electric vehicles in use globally could reach carmaker estimates of between 9 million and 20 million by 2020 and between 40 million and 70 million by 2025.      While cars using internal combustion engines require up to 23 kg of copper each, the ICA report found that a hybrid electric vehicle uses nearly double that amount at 40 kg of copper, and a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle uses 60 kg.  Depending on the size of battery, an electric bus can use between 224 kg and 369 kg of copper.  Charging infrastructure for electric cars was another source of demand, the ICA report said.  Further out, the expected growth in vehicles that use roof-mounted solar panels would also require copper.

The southern African nation's grain agency has also raised $200 million from the government and private sector to purchase maize from farmers, the Herald newspaper said. The national treasury last week forecast output of the staple maize at 2.1 million tonnes this year, from 511,000 tonnes in 2016.  It is true we have banned all grain imports because we have produced enough this year and also because we need to protect our local farmers,  Davis Mharapira, the deputy minister of agriculture said. Mharapira said the Grain Marketing Board would pay $390 per tonne for white maize, almost triple the $143 for the September contract for white maize in South Africa, one of the countries from which Zimbabwe has previously imported maize. The deputy minister said the higher price would encourage farmers to produce more maize while the import ban would make it impossible for dealers to buy the grain abroad and resell it at a higher price locally. Zimbabwe has since 2001 been importing maize to meet domestic demand of 1.8 million tonnes, blamed in part on seizures of white-owned farms by the government of President Robert Mugabe that hit commercial agriculture production. Mharapira said the national strategic grain reserve was holding 180,000 tonnes of maize, far below its targeted requirements of between 500,000 and 700,000 tonnes.

The 10-year cash JGB yield added half a basis point to 0.060 percent, while the September 10-year JGB futures contract shed 0.06 point to finish at 150.39. At the Ministry of Finance's sale of one trillion yen ($9.09 billion) of 20-year JGBs with a 0.60 percent coupon, about 64.9734 percent of the bids were accepted at the lowest price of 100.250. The sale drew bids of 3.98 times the amount offered, up from the previous sale's bid-to-cover ratio of 3.84 times. The tail between the average and lowest accepted prices narrowed to 0.05, compared with that of previous month's offering at 0.09, indicating stronger demand for the bonds. In the superlong zone, the 20-year JGB yield fell half a basis point to 0.560 percent, while the 30-year JGB yield was also down half a basis point at 0.820 percent. The five-year yield rose half a basis point to minus 0.075 percent, after earlier nudging up to a four-month high of minus 0.065 percent. A break of that level would take it to its highest since mid-December. JGB yields also felt some upward pressure from U.S. Treasury yields, which rose on Monday after tepid demand at a 10-year Treasury auction offset strong demand at a three-year auction amid uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's policy outlook on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank is likely to go ahead with another 25-basis-point rate increase on Wednesday, the fourth hike of a rate increase cycle that started in December 2015, citing the improvement in the economy and temporary factors driving down prices. A Bank of Japan official on Tuesday rebuffed speculation that it was engaging in  stealth tapering  as its massive asset-buying programme nears its limit, stating instead its reduced bond buying reflected receding upward pressure on Japanese yields from U.S. Treasuries. Masayoshi Amamiya, the BOJ's executive-director overseeing monetary policy, told Parliament that the pace of bond buying had slowed because U.S. Treasury yields have fallen - enabling the central bank to cap Japanese long-term rates while also reducing its purchases. $1 = 110.0200 yen Reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-bonds-idUSL3N1JA2GW"},

Oil and gas majors, Woodside Petroleum and Oil Search, added 2 percent and 1.3 percent. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index finished marginally higher as gains in consumer cyclical shares and financials offset losses in technology and consumer staples stocks.

The nearly 150-page report suggested more than 100 changes, most of which would be made through regulators rather than Congress, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview. (bit.ly/2sVxOlt)  We were very focused on, what we can do by executive order and through regulators,  he said.  We think about 80 percent of the substance in the report can be accomplished by regulatory changes, and about 20 percent by legislation.  Republican President Donald Trump has gradually been nominating heads of financial agencies to carry out his agenda, but only Mnuchin and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton have been approved by Congress. Other agencies are operating under  acting  chiefs or have leaders appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Related CoverageFactbox: The Wall Street rules Trump could overhaul without CongressChanges proposed by the Treasury Department include easing up on restrictions big banks now face in their trading operations, lightening the annual stress tests they must undergo, and reducing the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has been aggressively pursuing bad behavior by financial institutions. The plan would also expand the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is chaired by Mnuchin, and change the way global capital standards are implemented to give U.S. banks a leg up against foreign rivals. Smaller banks would get some relief as well: Lenders with $50 billion or less in assets would have to jump through fewer regulatory hoops than rivals with multitrillion-dollar balance sheets. The industry has long sought many of the proposed changes, which would mostly benefit banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N). Industry trade groups applauded the proposal on Monday evening, though some said they wished there were more specifics on tricky questions, such as what level regulators should set for banks' assets before subjecting them to stricter rules.  This is the first time in a while where there's been an official undertaking where our concerns resonated with the folks in the driver's seat,  said Rich Foster, senior counsel for regulatory and legal affairs at the Financial Services Roundtable, a trade group. Representatives for the six largest U.S. banks declined to comment, did not immediately respond or said they were reviewing the document. Reform advocates and Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the plan as a handout to Wall Street and a dangerous one for U.S. consumers who lost homes and jobs during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a critic of Wall Street, said it would  make it easier for big banks to cheat their customers and spark another financial meltdown.  Her Democratic colleague Senator Sherrod Brown noted that Treasury consulted with industry groups more than consumer groups, by a ratio of 17-to-1, while developing its report.  The Treasury proposal advances ideas that have been pushed by industry lobbyists since Dodd-Frank was passed,  said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform.  We need more effective regulation and enforcement, not rollbacks driven by Wall Street and predatory lenders.  Mnuchin said the regulatory overhaul is needed to grow the economy, give consumers more choices and ensure U.S. taxpayers would not have to bail out big banks again. While the Trump administration has said it wants to protect consumers, existing rules limit their access to loans and investment products they want. By trying to make many of the changes through regulatory agencies, the Trump administration may avoid a lengthy and perhaps futile battle with Democratic lawmakers. Although the White House and Congress are led by Republicans, Democrats in the Senate can block legislation and are unlikely to support any overhaul that eases rules on big banks. Some of the Treasury's proposals, like defanging the CFPB, would require new laws to be written and therefore face an uphill political battle. The report, which focused on banks, is the first of four examinations being carried out by the Treasury Department after Trump pledged to do a  big number  on the Dodd-Frank reform law. Proposals on capital markets, clearing houses and derivatives as well as the insurance and asset management industries and financial innovation and banking technology will come later.

That would undermine the impact of supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which partly aimed to force traders holding oil in storage to sell to reduce bloated inventories that have sapped global prices.  Brent crude futures <0#LCO:> for delivery in half a year's time were this week around $1.50 per barrel above current prices, a market structure known as 'contango' that makes it profitable to store fuel instead of selling for direct use. Shipping data shows that at least 15 supertankers are sitting in Southeast Asia's Strait of Malacca and Singapore Strait, filled with unsold fuel.  While that is less than in previous months, traders said that volumes in storage could easily pick up.  If contango lasts, it's very possible that the amount of tankers used for storage rises back to levels seen earlier this year,  said a trader who fixes floating storage deals. He declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with media. High Supply Oil shipments to Asia remain high, stoking the supply glut in the region. Trade data shows that 21.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude came to Asia on tankers in May. While that is down from a peak in February, it is similar to levels in late 2016, before production cuts were announced. OPEC has so far shied away from making significant supply cuts to its biggest customers, most of which are in Asia. And other producers, especially from the United States, have stepped up exports, further stoking the glut. OPEC's de-facto leader Saudi Arabia now says it will cut July crude allocations to Asia by 300,000 bpd, although many Asian refiners so far say they have received all their allocations. Going forward, analysts said that storage levels would be key in determining the health of the oil market.

Electric or hybrid cars and buses are expected to reach 27 million by 2027, up from 3 million this year, according to a report by consultancy IDTechEx, commissioned by the International Copper Association (ICA).   Demand for electric vehicles is forecast to increase significantly over the next ten years as technology improves, the price gap with petrol cars is closed and more electric chargers are deployed,  IDTechEx Senior Technology Analyst Franco Gonzalez said in the report.   Our research predicts this increase will raise copper demand for electric cars and buses from 185,000 tonnes in 2017 to 1.74 million tonnes in 2027,  Gonzalez said. Electric vehicles use a substantial amount of copper in their batteries and in the windings and copper rotors used in electric motors. A single car can have up to six kilometers of copper wiring, according to the ICA.  The global market for copper is around 23.9 million tonnes, according to the International Copper Study Group. That suggests electric vehicles could account for about 6 percent of global copper demand in ten years, according to analyst estimates, rising from less than 1 percent this year.  The electric car market is still concentrated in a limited number of countries, according to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) last week.  Globally, 95 percent of electric car sales take place in just ten countries - China, the United States, Japan, Canada, Norway, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden - the IEA said. Still, the IEA expects there is a  good chance  that  electric vehicles in use globally could reach carmaker estimates of between 9 million and 20 million by 2020 and between 40 million and 70 million by 2025.      While cars using internal combustion engines require up to 23 kg of copper each, the ICA report found that a hybrid electric vehicle uses nearly double that amount at 40 kg of copper, and a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle uses 60 kg.  Depending on the size of battery, an electric bus can use between 224 kg and 369 kg of copper.  Charging infrastructure for electric cars was another source of demand, the ICA report said.  Further out, the expected growth in vehicles that use roof-mounted solar panels would also require copper.

Perdomo, who was 0-3 after his first 10 starts of the season, was finally credited with the win as the Padres ended a two-game losing streak by defeating the Cincinnati Reds 9-3 at Petco Park. But it was far from a solo effort for the 24-year-old right-hander. Catcher Austin Hedges had three hits and three RBIs. Rookie Franchy Cordero and Yangervis Solarte each had a homer among their two hits and two RBIs. And Jose Pirela and Cory Spangenberg both had two hits and two runs scored. The nights were particularly memorable for Cordero and Pirela. Cordero's home run was his first in the major leagues. And Pirela went 2-for-4 with an RBI and is 13-for-26 since being promoted from Triple-A El Paso on May 6.  It's fun to be there when a player hits his first home run in the major leagues,  Padres manager Andy Green said of Cordero.  He's impressed us ever since he came up (on May 27 when center fielder Manuel Margot went on the disabled list with a calf injury). Related CoveragePreview: Reds at PadresCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatch Franchy is a player. He's proven that he deserves to be here.  Perdomo (1-3) allowed three runs on seven hits and two walks with four strikeouts in 6 2/3 innings to get the win.  He was a lot better tonight when he pitched from the middle of the rubber,  said Green.  Perdomo got that lead and he ran with it,  said Reds manager Bryan Price.  Fastball and slider for strikes. He pounded the zone.  The Padres scored all nine of their runs in the first five innings against struggling right-handed veteran Bronson Arroyo (3-5), including scoring six runs in the second.  I felt good, but before I knew it there was a six-spot on the board,  said Arroyo.  It was one of those things. I couldn't stop the train from going downhill. Then it was just a matter of going deep in the game and not destroying the bullpen.  My arm is feeling much better than it did earlier in the year, yet the velocity seems to be down a little bit.   It's just learning to manage his stuff when the speed is down,  Price said of Arroyo.  And trying to manage a game with that type of stuff is a different animal. Thank goodness he got those final eight outs. I'm not trying to make it a great outing, it wasn't. But it could have been worse.  The Padres spotted Cincinnati two runs in the top of the first, then jumped on Arroyo for seven runs in the first two innings. The first inning marked the continuance of a bad trend for the Padres. Perdomo retired the first two hitters he faced then gave up two runs. The Reds loaded the bases on singles by Joey Votto and Adam Duvall and a walk to Eugenio Suarez ahead of a two-run single by Scott Schebler. The Reds have another bad trend going. They entered the game having given up a major league-worst 97 homers. By the end of the six-run second, the count had reached 99. Arroyo hit Cory Spangenberg to open the second. Allen Cordoba singled on a perfectly placed bunt to third ahead of a two-run double into the left-field corner by Hedges. Pirela singled home Hedges. Cordero followed with his first major league homer, a 361-foot, two-run shot to left. Two hitters later, Solarte homered on a 421-foot drive to center, his sixth homer of the season, making it 7-2. Solarte had put the Padres on the board in the first with a single after Pirela's double. The Padres extended their lead to 9-2 with single runs in the fourth and fifth on run-scoring singles by Wil Myers and Hedges. The white flag for Arroyo came with two outs in the fifth. Arroyo, who entered the game with a 6.25 earned run average in 12 starts, gave up nine runs on 13 hits in 4 2/3 innings to raise his ERA to 7.01. Padres batters were 13-for-25 against Arroyo with four doubles, a triple and two homers. The Reds scored their third run in the seventh on a run-scoring single by pinch-hitter Scooter Gennett. NOTES: The Reds and the Padres had the number two and three picks, respectively, in the first round of the Major League draft Monday . . . The Reds took INF/RHP Hunter Greene from Notre Dame High in Sherman Oaks, Calif., with the second pick. Greene is 6-foot-3 and 195 pounds.  We do not see prospects like this very often,  said Reds general manager Dick Williams.  The physical talent is special, but he exhibits great intangibles.  . . . The Padres then selected LHP MacKenzie Gore, 18, from Whiteville (N.C.) High with the third pick. Gore was 11-0 with two saves and a 0.19 earned run average in 74 1/3 innings this season.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-reds-padres-writethru-idUSMTZED6DH08X3J"},

General Gatot Nurmantyo's comments late on Monday that  there are clandestine  sleeper  cells across the sprawling Indonesian archipelago underscored concerns about Islamic State's growing influence in Southeast Asia.  After observation, we see that in almost every province ... there are already IS cells, but they are sleeper cells,  Nurmantyo told reporters in the capital, Jakarta. He singled out the predominantly Christian province of Papua as one of the few exceptions.  These sleeper cells can easily join up with other radical cells,  he said. Governments across the region have been on high alert since Islamic State-linked militants, mostly from Southeast Asian countries, overran a city in the southern Philippines about three weeks ago.   The Philippine military, which has carried out air strikes and raids in Marawi city, said on Tuesday the militants still control about 20 percent of the city. Indonesian and Malaysian officials have stepped up security to prevent militants from escaping from Marawi over their shared borders with the Philippines.  It's easy to jump from Marawi to Indonesia and we must all beware of sleeper cells being activated in Indonesia,  Nurmantyo said. Southeast Asian nations believe the region is home to thousands of Islamic State sympathizers, and Indonesia and Malaysia have detained scores of suspected militants in recent years.  Singapore said on Monday it had detained an assistant child-care worker suspected of trying to join Islamic State, the first woman to be held on such charges in Singapore.  A gun-and-bomb attack that killed four people in Jakarta last year marked the first Islamic State strike in the region. There has since been a string of small, Islamic State-inspired attacks in Indonesia, the latest of which were twin suicide bombings at a Jakarta bus station that killed three police officers last month.

Barring a major shakeup to James' supporting cast or a move to another team, the three-times NBA champion may never find a way to solve a Golden State Warriors squad that just dominated the playoffs like no team ever before.  Teams and franchises are going to be trying to figure out ways that they can put personnel together, the right group of guys together to be able to hopefully compete against this team,  James, 32, told reporters.  They're assembled as good as you can assemble, and I played against some really, really good teams that was assembled perfectly, and they're right up there.  James did all he could during the Finals but even with him averaging a triple-double the Cavaliers, who lost the best-of-seven series in five games, were no match for a Warriors team with an embarrassment of riches. James is in the latter stages of his career after 14 NBA seasons but is so dominant and playing at such a high level that he can turn any team into an instant contender. He will be an unrestricted free agent in 2018 but no matter where James decides to play it is unlikely he can steer clear of a Warriors team positioned for greatness.  They're going to be here for a while... Pretty much all their big-name guys are in their 20s, and they don't show any signs of slowing down,  said James.  They're built for -- from my eyes, they're built to last a few years.  James can hardly leave a game for fear of his team falling apart while he rests.  By contrast, NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant, who joined the Warriors last July, has a supporting cast that won a record-setting 73 regular season games last season. But James did not want to weigh into the discussion about whether the necessary pieces needed to build a true challenger to the Warriors are out there.  I don't know. I'm not a -- I'm not the GM of the team. I'm not in the front office, but I know our front office is going to continue to try to put our ball club, put our franchise in a position where we can compete for a championship year in and year out,  said James. Cavaliers Future There is already talk that Cleveland could work out a trade for Indiana Pacers small forward Paul George, a 27-year-old four-time All-Star who offers more offensive prowess and a stronger defensive presence than Cavs forward Kevin Love.  Adding George alongside James and Kyrie Irving would be a definite improvement for a Cavaliers team that would likely also be seeking a rim protector and a playmaker off the bench. But during the 2017 Finals reports circulated saying James could head to California to join the Lakers or Clippers as a free agent in 2018. Either way, the future of James in Cleveland will once again hang over the game's greatest player. He was vilified in 2010 when he left the Cavaliers to join the Miami Heat where he won two NBA titles before returning to Cleveland four years later and delivering the city their first NBA championship in 2016. James was also asked how he views the Warriors when he considers his future in the NBA.  Well, it's a two-sided question because for me personally -- I don't know,  said James.  I need to sit down and figure this thing out,  said James.  But as far as that team, they're going to be here for a while. They're going to be around for a while.

Who was the better team? The third time around, there was no doubt. The Warriors used a 28-4 flurry in the second quarter to take a lead they never relinquished, then relied on the scoring of Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry down the stretch to hold off the Cavaliers en route to a 129-120 victory Monday night, claiming their second NBA championship in seasons. Durant, the MVP of the Finals, had 39 points, and Curry added 34 for the Warriors, who captured the best-of-seven series 4-1 against the defending champions.  We did it together,  said Durant, a first-time champion.  Call us a super team, but it's been a lot of super teams that hasn't worked. We came together and we continued to just believe in each other and we sacrificed, and we're champions now.  Golden State completed an unprecedented 16-1 run through the NBA playoffs, registering the second-best average playoff point differential (plus-13.5) in league history. Completing a perfect 9-0 run at home during the postseason, the Warriors became the first San Francisco Bay Area team to win a championship at home since the Oakland Athletics won the 1974 World Series. Related CoveragePreview: Cavaliers at Warriors This is history,  Warriors forward Andre Iguodala said.  We're going down as one of the best teams ever, and that's a special thing you cannot take away from us.  Led by LeBron James' game-high 41 points, the Cavaliers hung within 108-102 with 8:29 to play on a 3-pointer by Kyle Korver. However, Iguodala assisted a Durant dunk and added one of his own off a Curry feed, reopening a double-digit lead and making the final 7:42 an extended celebration among the Oracle Arena fans.  Golden State (was) the best team this year,  James said.  They showcased that throughout the postseason, and we were another opponent in their way.  We left everything on the floor, and it still wasn't enough.  Durant shot 14 of 20 overall and 5 of 8 on 3-pointers, hitting three of his threes during the critical second-quarter run that lasted more than seven minutes and turned a 41-33 deficit into a 61-45 advantage. Curry shot 10 of 20, converted 12 of his 15 free throw attempts, found time for six rebounds and completed a double-double with a game-high 10 assists. When the game became two-on-two, Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue observed, his team had little chance.  They started to go with the pick-and-roll with Steph Curry and Durant, which might be one of the most unstoppable pick-and-rolls in our league,  Lue said.  And they waited until late to do it. That's a tough play to stop.  The Warriors, who were playing a Game 5 for the first time in the postseason, shot 51.1 percent from the field and 36.8 percent on 3-pointers. Iguodala chipped in with 20 points off the bench and Draymond Green had a 10-point, 12-rebound double-double for the Warriors, who topped 100 points for the 17th straight time in the playoffs.  There was never any question in my mind that this was going to work,  Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of the addition of Durant to a Curry-led core that already was good enough to make consecutive Finals.  This was the culmination of a year where (Durant and Curry) grew together and learned each other's games and got better and better all year. It was phenomenal to be a part of.  James collected a game-high 13 rebounds, eight assists and two steals to go with his 41 points in becoming the first player ever to average a triple-double in the Finals.  I have no reason to put my head down,  said James, who finished with averages of 33.6 points, 12.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists in the five-game series.  I have no reason to look back at what I could have done or what I shouldn't have done or what I could have done better for the team. I left everything I had out on the floor every single game for five games in this Finals, and you come up short.  Kyrie Irving, fighting through back tightness late in the game, had 26 points and J.R. Smith 25 for the Cavaliers, who, like the Warriors, were competing in their third straight Finals. The Cavaliers shot 53.4 percent from the field and 45.8 percent on 3-pointers, but were outrebounded 42-40 and outscored 23-15 at the free-throw line.  A lot of guys cried because they wanted it bad,  Lue reported of the postgame scene in the Cleveland locker room.  That's all you can ask.  NOTES: The Warriors' .941 winning percentage in the playoffs (16-1) bettered the previous mark of .938 established by the 2001 Los Angeles Lakers, who went 15-1. ... The highest average point differential in NBA playoff history remains plus-14.5, set by the 1971 Milwaukee Bucks. ... The championship was the 17th won by a San Francisco Bay Area franchise in baseball, basketball or football.

Darvish worked seven strong innings and Nomar Mazara provided some insurance with a two-out, three-run homer in the eighth inning in the Texas Rangers' 6-1 win over the Houston Astros on Monday night at Minute Maid Park. Darvish (6-4) allowed just one hit, an RBI single by Astros third baseman Alex Bregman, and three walks while striking out four. Aside from the lone run he surrendered, Darvish did not allow a runner to reach scoring position. He retired the first seven batters he faced and, after issuing a one-out walk to Marwin Gonzalez in the sixth inning, set down the final five batters he faced on the night.  I thought it was a great night for Yu,  Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.  His sinker played very well to both sides of the plate. He was able to run the four-seam (fastball) up and down to left-handers. Curveball showed up big for him early; didn't break out the slider until the sixth, which allowed him to get some late outs. Just a great performance. Felt like the ball came out really clean for Yu tonight and seemed to be very strong.  Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at AstrosTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchHouston Astros - PlayerWatchThe Rangers (31-32) have won four consecutive games and five of six overall. They scraped across a pair of runs against Houston starter Joe Musgrove (4-5) before touching up the Astros bullpen in the sixth inning and again in the eighth. Third baseman Adrian Beltre produced an RBI double off right-hander Chris Devenski that scored Elvis Andrus for a 3-1 lead in the sixth. Mazara belted his eighth home run to straightaway center field off righty Dayan Diaz in the eighth. The Astros (44-21), ravaged by injuries to their rotation, lost right fielder Josh Reddick to a mild concussion. They have dropped five of their last seven games.  We sent him home,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of Reddick.  He's going to rest and we're going to reevaluate him tomorrow. It's not something that immediately puts him on the concussion DL. It's something we're going to take day-to-day.  Making his first start since May 26 after going on the disabled list with right shoulder discomfort, Musgrove breezed through the first inning and retired the first two batters in the second before suddenly hitting a bump in the road. Rougned Odor and Joey Gallo recorded back-to-back RBI triples in the second, with Odor plating Jonathan Lucroy to break the scoreless tie. Gallo was later erased at the plate for the final out as he tried to score on a miscue by the Astros. Musgrove recovered the errant baseball and made a throw to catcher Brian McCann, who applied the tag on Gallo just before he touched home plate. Musgrove departed with two outs in the fifth inning, allowing two runs on five hits and one walk with two strikeouts on 75 pitches.  Seventy-five (pitches) was kind of a lower count for me,  Musgrove said.  I know I understand I am coming off a little DL stint. I expected to not go 100 but I would have liked to go longer. Would have liked to give our bullpen a little bit more time off there.  A half-inning later, the Astros mustered their lone hit off Darvish, with Bregman plating Carlos Beltran with his two-out single to left. But Beltre got that run back for the Rangers in the sixth and Darvish made sure the cushion was sufficient.  I usually stay with my strength and I go with my stuff, what I've got on the day,  said Darvish, who departed with the Rangers trailing in each of his previous three starts.  But that previous outing that I learned I just studied hard on each hitter and what their tendencies are and I went at it today.  NOTES: Astros RHP Lance McCullers landed on the 10-day disabled list Monday, retroactive to June 9, with lower back discomfort. McCullers was scheduled to start on Tuesday but RHP Brad Peacock will pitch on short rest while RHP Francis Martes will make his first career start on Wednesday. ... Barring unforeseen setbacks, Texas RHP Tyson Ross is on pace to make his season and Rangers debut on Friday against the Seattle Mariners. Ross is on the 60-day disabled list recovering from thoracic outlet surgery and back spasms. He signed as a free agent with Texas after spending the previous four seasons with San Diego. ... Rangers CF Carlos Gomez will complete additional workouts with the club before a decision is made regarding when he will be sent out for a rehab assignment. Gomez landed on the 10-day disabled list on May 16 with a right hamstring strain.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rangers-astros-writethru-idUSMTZED6DGW68WZ"},

This suggests some funds are willing to accept higher political risk now that valuations are lower. Qatari credit default swaps and international bond yields fell back substantially on Monday. However, some analysts are still cutting targets for Qatari stocks, so any market rebound is likely to be limited and gradual.

Rupee forwards were active, with spot-next forwards trading at 152.90/95 per dollar at 0515 GMT, weaker from Monday's close of 152.85/90. One-week forward traded at 153.10/15, compared with Monday's close of 153.05/10.  Today, there is some pressure (to depreciate) with some (importer) demand. There are general imports and some oil bills,  a currency dealer said, requesting anonymity. The rupee has been under pressure after central bank governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said the bank would allow gradual depreciation of the currency. The central bank has set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year. The spot rupee, which the central bank had fixed at 152.50 since May 5, did not trade on Tuesday. Foreign investors bought a net 1.37 billion rupees ($8.98 million) worth of government securities in the week ended June 7. They have sold a net 39.96 billion rupees worth of securities so far this year. Trading was dull as investors assessed the extent of damage to the economy from recent floods and landslides. The country's main agricultural crops - tea and rubber - were hit by the worst torrential rains in 14 years. Damage to agricultural exports would put pressure on the rupee, currency dealers said. However, they added there was some optimism over expected inflows in the form of international assistance that could help offset potential downward pressure on the local currency. While the inflows are likely to help the rupee, the central bank would have to tighten interest rates to curb unnecessary credit growth and inflationary pressure, currency dealers added. The floods could hurt overall economic growth and also widen the government's budget deficit with high infrastructure spending. Sri Lankan shares were down 0.06 percent at 6,659.37, as of 0516 GMT.

Mohammed Shaheldul Islam has limited diplomatic immunity and was ordered to surrender his passport when he appeared before Queens Supreme Court Justice Daniel Lewis, said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown in a statement. Bail was set at $50,000 bond or $25,000 cash. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted. According to the indictment, Islam brought another Bangladeshi, Mohammed Amin, to New York between 2012 and 2013 to work as a household help for Islam and his family.  Soon after Mr. Amin's arrival, the defendant allegedly took his passport and required the man to work 18 hours a day ... Even though Mr. Amin had a contract which outlines his compensation, it is alleged he was never paid for his work,  the statement said.  If the victim disobeyed the defendant's orders, Mr. Amin was allegedly physically assaulted by the defendant, who either struck him with his hand or sometimes with a wooden shoe,  it said. A spokesman for the Bangladesh embassy in Washington said it believed Amin had filed the case in bad faith and the allegations were  fabricated  and  baseless .       It may be noted that Mr. Islam decided to cancel Mr. Amin’s contract and was preparing to send him back to Bangladesh due to his irresponsible acts,  Shamim Ahmad, the spokesman, said.  We hope the court will give its verdict in the matter judiciously,  he said.  Shameem Ahsan, the consul general of Bangladesh, told Reuters over the telephone from New York that Amin disappeared on May 17, 2016 and the very next day the consulate informed the U.S. state department office in New York. “It is surprising for us that after 13 months he has appeared with these allegations, why did he not raise this issue earlier,  he said.  According to the charges, Amin's only form of income came from tips from guests at parties and a  miniscule  amount of money Islam sent to Amin's family in Bangladesh. On several occasions when Amin sought to leave, Islam hit him and threatened to harm his mother and young son in Bangladesh, the statement said.  On occasion, Islam also stated that he would have Amin's college-age daughter  shamed  if he did not continue to work as his servant, the statement said. The statement did not make clear what Islam meant by shaming. The statement also said that in 2014, shortly after an Indian diplomat in New York was charged with labor trafficking, Islam wrote a check for Amin's cash-tip earnings that the latter then had to deposit in a bank account to create the appearance of a paycheck. In late 2013, Devyani Khobragade, who was India's deputy consul general in New York, was arrested and subsequently accused of visa fraud and forcing her housekeeper and nanny to work 100-hour weeks for just over $1 an hour. Khobragade's arrest and strip search provoked outrage in India and caused a major diplomatic rift between the United States and India. The charges against her were dismissed because she had diplomatic immunity. After she left the United States, a New York grand jury later issued a new indictment for visa fraud. Last year, a Manhattan federal judge declared the former Bangladeshi consul general in New York and his wife to be in default for ignoring a lawsuit by a former domestic worker who claimed they forced him to work without pay in slavery-like conditions.

Work at the international fund, which aims to help poor nations cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt their economies to heatwaves, storms and rising seas has been slowed by legal red tape and the approval process, board members say.   The GCF, whose South Korean headquarters opened in 2013,  says it only approved projects worth $1.3 billion in 2016, short of its goal of $2.5 billion. It has approved total loans and grants worth $2.2 billion. All but $13 million is still in the bank. GCF officials declined to comment on Trump's remarks or elaborate on the slow pace of approvals, deferring to the 24 board members who represent both developed nation donors and developing nations that will receive funds.  On disbursement, my own personal view is that it's appalling,  said Zaheer Fakir, a board member from South Africa.  Announcing on June 1 that the United States was quitting the 2015 Paris climate agreement, Trump said he was halting U.S. contributions to the GCF after $1 billion paid under former President Barack Obama, who had pledged a total of $3 billion. Trump, who says climate action will cost U.S. jobs and wants to promote the U.S. coal industry, said the fund cost taxpayers a  vast fortune  and many other nations  will never pay one dime.   Reuters contacted five current and former board members, who said they did not agree with Trump's comments. They acknowledged the fund had been slow to get going but said it was difficult to get projects off the ground and unreasonable to expect big flows of money straight away.  The fund is like a plane that's taken off but we're still building it in mid-air. That's a risky situation,  said another board member who did not want to be named.  No Slush Fund More than 40 nations in 2014 promised a total of $10.3 billion to the GCF, including Obama's $3 billion.  Washington's $1 billion is the biggest single contribution so far. But Sweden's $581 million, for instance, works out as $60 per capita, against $3 per American. Japan has promised $1.5 billion.  The board members also say the 2016 project approval goal had been largely aspirational to encourage nations to step up climate finance. Fakir said that the board sometimes lacked time to consider projects in detail and developed countries often attached too many conditions to loans.      Everyone wants to prove Trump wrong about the GCF. It's not a slush fund - it's defining the climate agenda,  he said of GCF goals of spurring wider public and private funds for grants and loans. The fund also faces legal complexities in starting to work with multilateral lenders such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank or private banks. Once agreements are in place, a flood of disbursements is expected to follow. Another legal hurdle is that the GCF is associated with the United Nations but is not a U.N. agency and so its staff lack legal protection, for instance, from prosecution if projects go awry. The fund is seeking to negotiate nation-by-nation agreements to protect its operations but has signed only about a dozen. So far, the GCF's biggest single disbursement for a project is $5 million, to the private New York-based Acumen Fund to develop solar energy in Kenya and Rwanda. Such projects will go ahead despite Trump's decision. Huge Blow GCF data show it has also disbursed $1 million to a Mongolian commercial bank to help curb greenhouse gas emissions, and $1 million to a project to protect the Peruvian rain forest. Many governments, cities and states have expressed support for the fund after Trump's pullout. But they are unlikely to fill the shortfall to Obama's pledge.  There is a gap of $2 billion which is about 20 percent of the total. It is of course is a huge blow,  said Lars Roth, a board member for Sweden. Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman Pierre-Alain Eltschinger said the U.S. was likely to be recorded as in arrears. There is no legal recourse to demand Trump pays more - national payments are voluntary.     Eltschinger said it was  not realistic to expect anyone to make up for the U.S. shortfall. So this remains a problem.   Others hope that other nations will step up.  Other countries should fill the void. If China or Russia wants to take the lead in GCF, they will have to increase their payment,  said Song Young-gil, former Incheon city mayor who spearheaded a successful bid to host the GCF headquarters. The GCF, which has about 110 staff in Incheon, was set up after a 2009 commitment by rich nations to raise climate finance to $100 billion a year by 2020, from both public and private sources. The GCF is just one part of that financing goal.  In Paris in 2015, governments agreed to set a new, higher target for climate finance by 2025. The United States has a seat on the GCF board at least until end-2018. Its claim for a seat beyond that may weaken if other countries exceed its $1 billion contribution. with extra reporting by Soyoung Kim in Seoul, Michael Shields in Zurich, Luca Trogni in Milan; writing by Alister Doyle; editing by Anna Willard","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-fund-idUSKBN1940K9"},

Coming under administration could, however, help Ten by allowing it to freeze and then renegotiate expensive licensing contracts with U.S. studios for shows such as NCIS and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Broadcasters and Ten in particular have suffered large losses and are scrambling to cut costs as advertisers follow viewers who have turned to streaming services like Netflix (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) Amazon Prime.  Going into receivership, they can be very tough in their renegotiation, and more realistic,  said Steve Allen, managing director of Essence Media.  The programs and the ratings that they're getting for the costs involved is a mismatch; it wasn't five years ago, but it is now.   Ten had flagged in April that it might collapse if it did not extend or secure a new borrowing arrangement, adding that it was looking to increase the size of its current facility from A$200 million ($150 million) to A$250 million. The current facility is backed by three Australian tycoons. On Tuesday, Ten said that it had been informed that two of them, News Corp (NWSA.O) co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch and regional TV owner Bruce Gordon would not be extending their support beyond Dec. 23, 2017. It was not immediately clear if Crown Resorts (CWN.AX) casino boss James Packer had also withdrawn his support. A representative for Packer was not immediately available for comment. Ten's situation puts pressure on the Australian government to push through a deregulation package that would make it easier for local traditional media companies to buy each other. Lachlan Murdoch owns 7.7 percent of Ten and News Corp-controlled local cable TV firm Foxtel owns another 14 percent. Analysts have said they expect Foxtel would be interested in buying out Ten if the deregulation package went through. The package has wide support in the media industry but some  independent senators, who control the Australian upper house, have said they are concerned the diversity of local content could suffer. While receivership could be a good opportunity for Ten to break onerous contracts, it is not without risk as the network could lose some good shows, said Laurie Fitzgerald, a business recovery specialist at corporate adviser William Buck.  The MasterChef group...they could just turn around to Ten and say: you've broken our contract, we'll shop it around, we might just see what Nine will offer us,  said Fitzgerald. Ten also said it had asked to have its shares suspended for two days while it considers its position in light of the stance taken by its backers.  Up to Friday's close, Ten's shares had plunged 83 percent this year, giving it a market value of A$58 million. In 2014, it rejected a $588 million takeover bid from Time Warner.

Work at the international fund, which aims to help poor nations cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt their economies to heatwaves, storms and rising seas has been slowed by legal red tape and the approval process, board members say.   The GCF, whose South Korean headquarters opened in 2013,  says it only approved projects worth $1.3 billion in 2016, short of its goal of $2.5 billion. It has approved total loans and grants worth $2.2 billion. All but $13 million is still in the bank. GCF officials declined to comment on Trump's remarks or elaborate on the slow pace of approvals, deferring to the 24 board members who represent both developed nation donors and developing nations that will receive funds.  On disbursement, my own personal view is that it's appalling,  said Zaheer Fakir, a board member from South Africa.  Announcing on June 1 that the United States was quitting the 2015 Paris climate agreement, Trump said he was halting U.S. contributions to the GCF after $1 billion paid under former President Barack Obama, who had pledged a total of $3 billion. Trump, who says climate action will cost U.S. jobs and wants to promote the U.S. coal industry, said the fund cost taxpayers a  vast fortune  and many other nations  will never pay one dime.   Reuters contacted five current and former board members, who said they did not agree with Trump's comments. They acknowledged the fund had been slow to get going but said it was difficult to get projects off the ground and unreasonable to expect big flows of money straight away.  The fund is like a plane that's taken off but we're still building it in mid-air. That's a risky situation,  said another board member who did not want to be named.  No Slush Fund More than 40 nations in 2014 promised a total of $10.3 billion to the GCF, including Obama's $3 billion.  Washington's $1 billion is the biggest single contribution so far. But Sweden's $581 million, for instance, works out as $60 per capita, against $3 per American. Japan has promised $1.5 billion.  The board members also say the 2016 project approval goal had been largely aspirational to encourage nations to step up climate finance. Fakir said that the board sometimes lacked time to consider projects in detail and developed countries often attached too many conditions to loans.      Everyone wants to prove Trump wrong about the GCF. It's not a slush fund - it's defining the climate agenda,  he said of GCF goals of spurring wider public and private funds for grants and loans. The fund also faces legal complexities in starting to work with multilateral lenders such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank or private banks. Once agreements are in place, a flood of disbursements is expected to follow. Another legal hurdle is that the GCF is associated with the United Nations but is not a U.N. agency and so its staff lack legal protection, for instance, from prosecution if projects go awry. The fund is seeking to negotiate nation-by-nation agreements to protect its operations but has signed only about a dozen. So far, the GCF's biggest single disbursement for a project is $5 million, to the private New York-based Acumen Fund to develop solar energy in Kenya and Rwanda. Such projects will go ahead despite Trump's decision. Huge Blow GCF data show it has also disbursed $1 million to a Mongolian commercial bank to help curb greenhouse gas emissions, and $1 million to a project to protect the Peruvian rain forest. Many governments, cities and states have expressed support for the fund after Trump's pullout. But they are unlikely to fill the shortfall to Obama's pledge.  There is a gap of $2 billion which is about 20 percent of the total. It is of course is a huge blow,  said Lars Roth, a board member for Sweden. Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman Pierre-Alain Eltschinger said the U.S. was likely to be recorded as in arrears. There is no legal recourse to demand Trump pays more - national payments are voluntary.     Eltschinger said it was  not realistic to expect anyone to make up for the U.S. shortfall. So this remains a problem.   Others hope that other nations will step up.  Other countries should fill the void. If China or Russia wants to take the lead in GCF, they will have to increase their payment,  said Song Young-gil, former Incheon city mayor who spearheaded a successful bid to host the GCF headquarters. The GCF, which has about 110 staff in Incheon, was set up after a 2009 commitment by rich nations to raise climate finance to $100 billion a year by 2020, from both public and private sources. The GCF is just one part of that financing goal.  In Paris in 2015, governments agreed to set a new, higher target for climate finance by 2025. The United States has a seat on the GCF board at least until end-2018. Its claim for a seat beyond that may weaken if other countries exceed its $1 billion contribution. with extra reporting by Soyoung Kim in Seoul, Michael Shields in Zurich, Luca Trogni in Milan; writing by Alister Doyle; editing by Anna Willard","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/climatechange-fund-idUSL8N1J614X"},

European stocks markets were also poised to recover from Monday's sell-off, with financial spreadbetter CMC Markets expecting Britain's FTSE to open 0.4 percent higher, Germany's DAX to rise 0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 to start the day up 0.1 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent, recouping about half of the previous session's losses as regional tech shares regained their composure. The MSCI Asia Pacific Information Technology index steadied, after sliding 1.4 percent on Monday. Some analysts had predicted Asian tech shares would not see as intense a selloff as their U.S. peers as their valuations were less stretched.  Comparatively, valuations for the IT sector in the Asia Pacific region are less expensive compared to the U.S., which may be why we're not seeing the situation further aggravate for a second session,  said Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG in Singapore.  Moreover, we have also seen the market buying into the sector following the initial drop on the S&P; 500 index in Monday’s session. This shows that there remains market interest in this sector, which has outperformed in terms of Q1 earnings.  Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.1 percent. South Korea's KOSPI gained 0.5 percent, with the biggest stock Samsung Electronics up 0.5 percent after Monday's 1.6 percent slump. Naver Corp. and LG Innotek, which led Asian losses on Monday, were flat and 1.3 percent higher, respectively. Taiwan's tech-heavy benchmark index added 0.3 percent, with the biggest company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. little changed. Major Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry slipped 0.5 percent, but that was a moderation from Monday's 2.9 percent slump. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.4 percent and Chinese shares climbed 0.3 percent. On Wall Street, tech giants including Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft were sold for the second consecutive day on Monday. That dragged the Nasdaq down 0.5 percent, the S&P; 500 0.1 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.2 percent. In currencies, the Canadian dollar extended Monday's strong gains, after a Bank of Canada official said the central bank would assess if it needs to keep interest rates at near-record lows as the economy grows. That was a change in tone for the central bank, which said earlier this year that rate cuts remain on the table. The  loonie,  which hit a two-month high during the session, strengthened about 0.25 percent to trade at C$1.329, after gaining 1.1 percent on Monday.  It feels like a long time since markets have been treated to unscheduled hints of tightening, and this was quite apparent when you saw the positive reaction of CAD crosses overnight,  Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at ThinkMarkets in Melbourne, wrote in a note. The dollar inched higher to 110 yen, after falling 0.3 percent on Monday, ahead of a widely expected interest rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve this week. A small majority of traders in China's financial markets think its central bank will likely raise short-term interest rates again this week if the U.S. Federal Reserve hikes its key policy rate, according to a Reuters poll. The Bank of Japan, which is also meeting this week, is expected to keep its monetary policy unchanged. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of trade-weighted peers, rose 0.1 percent to 97.219. Sterling was fractionally lower at $1.266 ahead of a Bank of England meeting on Thursday at which the benchmark rate is expected to remain at 0.25 percent. The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.1193. In commodities, oil advanced on news that Saudi Arabia would make supply cuts to customers. U.S. crude rose 0.5 percent to $46.32 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent also added 0.5 percent to $48.56.

However, there are increasing signs that this may not be the case any more, at least not in every country in Asia, as renewable energy sources rapidly become cheaper and achieve the utility scale needed to ensure reliable generation. The old and new paradigms were the focus at a high-level, invitation-only forum in Singapore last week, organized by the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC). The representatives of the coal industry, as well as some respected industry analysts, presented a fairly bullish outlook for the period up to 2030, pointing to a strong pipeline of projects in both traditional coal buyers such as Japan, China and India, as well as new entrants such as Vietnam and the Philippines. On the other side, energy and climate academics and representatives of think tanks pointed to the increasing cost-competitiveness of renewable power, mounting political and community pressure for cleaner energy and the potential disruptive influence of newer technologies such as battery storage. Overall, the message from the coal industry was that they are still the cheapest, will be for some time and are therefore not going anywhere. The word from the academics and energy policy specialists was that the coal industry is too comfortable and is largely unaware that it is actually now in an existential fight, and the forces arrayed against it are motivated and increasingly effective. President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris agreement on limiting carbon pollution hasn't been replicated across Asia, with top emitters China and India pledging to meet their commitments under the deal. It's also becoming clearer that the forces pushing for increased use of renewables are moving to target countries planning to boost the use of coal. The tactics are varied and include lobbying governments and industry, trying to restrict financing for coal-fired plants, public awareness campaigns and grassroots activism. Up to now the efforts of the environmental lobby have largely been focused on developed countries, but they are now switching targets to include nations like Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia, all of which are planning new coal generation. Rapid advances in technology, such as battery storage, can also disrupt coal's advance in Asia, and this is likely to be a factor when banks, utilities and governments are deciding whether to spend billions of dollars on a new coal-fired plant that has a lifespan of at least 25 years. Coal Storm Clouds Gather The evidence seems to be that while coal use in Asia is likely to rise in coming years as plants already under construction are commissioned, the longer-term outlook is becoming far less clear. The amount of coal-fired generation capacity that started construction around the world in 2016 was 63.06 gigawatts (GW), 62 percent lower that in 2015, according to a March paper by environmental groups Coalswarm, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace. The paper also identified a 164 percent jump in the amount of coal-fired capacity put on hold in 2016 from the prior year, although the actual amount of coal capacity operating globally actually rose 3 percent to 1,964 GW. Breaking the data down by countries in Asia showed that China has 145.5 GW under construction, but 441.7 GW on hold, while India has 48.2 GW being built and 82.5 GW on hold. Among emerging coal importers, Vietnam had 15.2 GW under construction and 2.8 GW on hold, Malaysia had 3.6 GW being built and the Philippines had 4.5 GW under construction and 0.9 GW on hold. The coal industry would point to the fact that as of January this year some 272.9 GW of coal power is being built, while the environmental lobby may fire back that 607.4 GW is on hold. One of the coal miners present at the KAPSARC forum said that his company was fielding numerous inquiries from utilities across South East Asia trying to lock in long-term supply deals for newly-built coal-fired plants. But the miners also did express some caution about the outlook for seaborne imports to China and India, the world's two biggest importers. China is trying to limit coal use in order to improve air quality in major cities and India's government has stated that it wants coal imports to drop to zero. While India's aim of zero imports is fanciful, it's possible that it could drop down to a figure closer to 100 million tonnes a year, which would be sufficient to meet its needs for coking coal used to make steel, as well as thermal coal for coastal power plants that were designed to run on imported fuel. This would be a drop of more than 100 million tonnes from the record 206 million India imported in 2015, and well below the 194.6 million last year. A drop of such magnitude would likely outweigh any potential increase in seaborne imports by newer consumers in South East Asia. The future of India's demand for imported coal is far from certain, but the trend seems to be clearer, and that's for lower imports. India's ambitious targets for renewable energy may also crimp its need for more coal-fired power plants in coming years, and the record low prices achieved at recent market auctions for solar power supply show that coal has a fight on its hands. Coal-fired power is still about half the price of liquefied natural gas in most Asian markets, meaning a U.S.-style natural gas revolution is unlikely in power generation. But the rapid rise of renewables, coupled with an increasing focus on cleaner energy means that many Asian countries are likely to face a choice they haven't had before. They can now be cheap and green, whereas before they could either be cheap or green.

So nobody could fault Smith for grinning as he rounded first base Monday night on his first career home run. His 409-foot shot to right-center field set the tone as Chicago held on for a 10-7 win over the Baltimore Orioles.  Gave one big clap when I hit first, and then I smiled and I was like, 'All right, first one's out of the way, now we go,'  Smith said.  I've been feeling good, I've been taking a lot of good swings, it just wasn't coming through.  I was kind of joking, I got a new shipment of bats in today, a different model. It was the first swing of the game I took with it and I was like, 'All right, let's order about three dozen of those.' It comes when you least expect it.  Matt Davidson also hit a home run and drove in two as the White Sox notched 14 hits. Avisail Garcia added a single, double and three RBIs for Chicago (27-35). The White Sox scored more than five runs for the first time since May 30 and matched a season high on defense by turning four double plays. Trey Mancini went 2-for-4 with a home run and three RBIs to lead the Orioles. On a night when Manny Machado returned to the starting lineup, Chris Davis went down because of a strained oblique. Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at White SoxBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchBaltimore (31-31) dropped its fifth game in a row and fell to .500 for the first time this season.  Are we?  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said when asked about the .500 mark.  I haven't looked at it in a week or so.  Showalter's avoidance is understandable. During their five-game skid, the Orioles have been outscored 54-16. Left-hander Wade Miley (2-4) was the latest Orioles pitcher to walk off the field with his head down. He surrendered six runs on six hits in 2 1/3 innings. Miley did not mince words when it came to his performance.  I just (stunk),  Miley said.  It's as simple as that. I feel like everything I threw up there, they put a barrel on. That's all there is to it. That game's on me.  White Sox right-hander Jake Petricka (1-0) pitched 2 1/3 scoreless innings of relief to earn the victory. He followed starting right-hander Mike Pelfrey, who allowed two runs on six hits in 3 2/3 innings.  He gave us what he could,  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said of Pelfrey.  We didn't want it to fall apart. You want to keep the lead.  Smith drove his first career home run to right-center field in the second inning to put the White Sox on top 2-0. Chicago added four runs in the third to seize a 6-0 advantage. Jose Abreu, Garcia and Davidson each drove in a run during the barrage, which chased Miley from the game. A throwing error by Adam Jones in center field compounded the Orioles' problems and allowed another run to score. Baltimore trimmed the deficit to 6-2 in the fourth. Seth Smith ripped a ground-rule double over the center-field wall to score Welington Castillo, and Smith scored moments later on Jones' single to left field. Garcia drove in two more runs with a single in the fourth to make it 8-2. Smith added a sacrifice fly in the fifth. A solo shot by Davidson gave the White Sox a 10-2 lead in the seventh. Baltimore scored four runs in the eighth to close the gap to 10-6. Hyun Soo Kim drove in one run with a single, and Mancini followed with a three-run home run that sneaked over the right-field wall. Jonathan Schoop finished the scoring in the ninth with an RBI single to left-center field. White Sox left fielder Melky Cabrera threw out Schoop at second base to end the game. NOTES: Orioles 1B Chris Davis left the game in the third inning because of a strained right oblique muscle. The 31-year-old appeared to injure himself while flying out to deep right-center field. He is hitting .226 with 14 home runs and 26 RBIs in 61 games. ... White Sox OF Leury Garcia did not play because of an injured left hand. ... Orioles 3B Manny Machado returned to the lineup after missing four games because of a strained left wrist. He went 2-for-4. ... White Sox RHP Nate Jones experienced a setback and has halted his throwing program in his attempted return from a right elbow injury. The 31-year-old has been on the disabled list since May 4. ... The Orioles recalled RHP Miguel Castro from Triple-A Norfolk and optioned RHP Logan Verrett to Norfolk.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-orioles-whitesox-writethru-idUSMTZED6DGWMWY6"},

Overhauling the country's infrastructure - roads, tunnels, ports and sewage plants, many of them built after 1970s when the construction boom started - is a looming burden on the government, whose deficit has already swollen to more than twice its GDP. Abe's solution is to sell public assets to companies or allow firms to manage them, which he argues would also help reduce the bulging deficit and generate economic momentum and jobs. Success here would be a boon to stalled structural reforms, which along with monetary and fiscal stimulus, make up his three-pronged approach, or the so-called  three arrows , to reenergize long-moribund activity. So far, Japan has sold the right to operate Kansai International Airport, serving Osaka, and Sendai International Airport in northern Japan. Cashing in on a tourism boom, the government is planning to privatise more regional airports. Now authorities aim to open markets for the water systems to private investors. But the plans are not getting much traction. Cities don't trust businesses to take over something as vital as water supplies. Nara, Japan's ancient capital, last year rejected a proposal to let a business operate its water works jointly with the city. “What we are afraid of the most, if the service is privatised, is that the new entity may stop proper water supply in some areas to seek efficiencies,  said Kentaro Shirakawa, a member of Nara's city assembly. So far, only Hamamatsu, a town in south central Japan, has picked a group of companies led by France's Veolia (VIE.PA) as a winning bidder to operate its sewage system - but not the hard part, overhauling the pipes. The obstacles highlight the difficulties Abe faces in carrying out deeper reforms he says Japan needs to put the economy on a sustainable footing as its population declines. An underground sewer facility is pictured in Tokyo, Japan June 8, 2017. Picture taken June 8, 2017.Toru HanaiHe envisions a 21 trillion yen ($190 billion) market of public-private partnerships (PPPs) by 2022 where businesses operate government-owned assets. So far, that market has reached 9.1 trillion yen, with the Kansai airport accounting for 5 trillion of that. Abe's government is urging cities to privatize their water works as replacement costs rise and their populations decline. An underground sewer facility is pictured in Tokyo, Japan June 8, 2017. Picture taken June 8, 2017.Toru HanaiAssembly members and local officials in some cities believe that privatizing will lighten the fiscal burden on their own dwindling resources.  By 2035, about 28 percent of sewer pipes - or 130,000 kilometers - will reach their 50-year lifespan. Replacement costs for pipes, pumps and other equipment are seen ballooning 66 percent to 1 trillion yen ($9.1 billion) over 20 years from 2013. Lawmakers in many cities, however, are concerned about whether private companies could provide services in the event of an earthquake, and what would happen if they went bankrupt. Opponents also argue privatization may result in job losses for the contractors that cities rely on now.  Cities have little incentive to privatize their water systems because they know they can fall back on the central government to bail them out if they run into a crisis, said Hideaki Tanaka, professor at Meiji University’s graduate school of governance studies.  For now, smaller cities and towns are waiting to see if such moves are successful in bigger cities. But most want to keep the status quo - even if they are in the red. In Nara, for instance, the water operations were already running a 200 million yen deficit each year.  They will probably leave the pipelines until they explode,” Tanaka said.

Singapore shares were up, rebounding from Monday's decline on the back of gains in the city-state's  big three  banks.     Advancing issues barely outnumbered declining ones by 1.34 to 1.     The final first-quarter jobless rate was revised downwards from the preliminary estimate of 2.3 percent, according to unemployment data released by the Ministry of Manpower.

Until Monday night, Dustin Pedroia, a former American League MVP and Rookie of the Year, a guy with 1,737 hits and 685 RBIs, had produced exactly one walk-off hit in a major league career that began in 2006. Now, it's two.  It feels good. I guess I hit most of my homers on the road,  Pedroia said after his 11th-inning single scored pinch runner Deven Marrero from second base and gave the Boston Red Sox, twice behind in the game, a 6-5 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. It was way back on June 19, 2010, against the Los Angeles Dodgers, when Pedroia delivered a walk-off hit, that one also a single.  Very surprising, considering the number of games he's played here, how good a hitter he is,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said after his team came back from 4-0 and 5-4 deficits to hand the last-place Phillies their sixth straight loss.  I wouldn't have known that, given his career here in Boston.  Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at Red SoxPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchPedroia, who had two hits and two RBIs, almost ended things in the ninth when he ripped a vicious line drive off the top of the Green Monster -- for a single.  Sometimes the wall gives you some hits and takes away a home run,  he said.  That's a part of it. It's happened before.  Pablo Sandoval, who didn't start the game, led off the 11th with a single off Casey Fien (0-1), and Marrero ran for him. Sandy Leon sacrificed Marrero to second, and Mookie Betts (four hits, two great defensive plays) was walked intentionally, setting up the winning hit. The Boston win came in the first of four straight interleague games between the teams in two cities. Matt Barnes (5-2) struck out five in two scoreless innings to get the win for Boston (35-28). Fien worked 2 1/3 innings. Boston's Hanley Ramirez tied the score with a two-out solo home run off Joaquin Benoit in the eighth inning, taking the struggling Rick Porcello off the hook and denying Jerad Eickhoff his first win since Sept. 21.  It was tough,  said Eickhoff, who has seven losses this season. He allowed four runs, three earned, in six innings.  These guys did a really good job of getting us out to a good lead, and I was just trying to keep us in the game the best I could.  Porcello, the reigning American League Cy Young Award winner, is 3-8 with a 4.67 ERA. Last year on the same date, he was 7-2 with a 3.81 ERA. Porcello has allowed a major-league-high 114 hits (compared with 72 at this point last season). He gave up four runs in the first inning and another in the sixth. He yielded 10 hits and a walk with four strikeouts in six innings.  He's not all the way there yet, obviously with the number of hits he surrendered here tonight,  said Farrell.  But while he's working at it to get back to being a little bit more refined, we picked him up offensively here tonight.  Andrew Benintendi hit a solo homer and stroked an RBI single his first two times up for the Red Sox. He finished 3-for-5. Philadelphia's Howie Kendrick had three hits, went 3-for-4 on stolen-base attempts and committed two errors. Former Red Sox outfielder Daniel Nava also had three hits, and Tommy Joseph had a two-run single for the last-place Phillies (21-41). Nava also made a nifty play, turning a foul fly into a double play to kill a threat in the 10th.  You can't say enough about how we played these guys in Boston,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  We played them tough, had chances to win, came out swinging early, couldn't add on.  Said Farrell:  Tonight's a big team win. So many guys chipping in, from a big night from Mookie at the top of the order, two critical and crucial innings by Matt Barnes after he's been worked fairly heavy of late; Panda (Sandoval) with a key base hit to lead off the final inning; Mitch (Moreland, two hits) once again with some big hits, Benny (Benintendi) jumps back in after a day off, swung the bat very well -- you could check the box on a number of guys so this is very much a team win here tonight.  NOTES: Red Sox first base coach Ruben Amaro Jr., a former Philadelphia GM, greeted each player he knew as the team stretched before the game, receiving hugs from several of them. He also met with the Phillies media. ... Red Sox TV analyst Jerry Remy revealed he is battling cancer for the fifth time. He met with the media before the game. ...

The Saudi comments were in reaction to remarks by Qatar Airway's chief executive that the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were violating international law by shutting out Qatari flights. The airspace closure was within its sovereign right to protect the country and its citizens from anything it sees as a threat and as a precautionary measure, Saudi Arabia's General Authority of Civil Aviation said in a statement published by the Saudi Press Agency.  Similar statements were also issued by the UAE and Bahraini aviation authorities after a CNN interview of Chief Executive of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, who criticized the three Arab countries for the airspace closure. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar a week ago, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies. Al Baker had appealed to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency which administers the Chicago convention that guarantees civil overflights to declare the airspace closure as illegal. The UAE General Aviation Authority said it is fully committed to the Chicago convention, but the state reserves the sovereign right under international law to take any precautionary measures to protect its national security if necessary, according to UAE state news agency WAM. The three countries' aviation bodies also said non-Qatari private and chartered flights from Qatar must submit requests to them at least 24 hours before crossing the airspace. The request should include a list of names and nationalities of crews and passengers, and the cargo carried by the aircraft, they said.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.  However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC's efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.  The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.  For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.  Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.  According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.  In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.    Infographic ID: '2rolpok'     Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.       A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,  said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.      Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.  Underhedged Anxieties  Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.  The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.  Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.   I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,  said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.  Some New Players  In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.  Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.  Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.   Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,  said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

The  Tele-Law  initiative launched on Sunday will be piloted in 500 village councils in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and then rolled out across the rest of the country in a phased manner, said the law ministry. Villagers will access the service through newly established  Common Service Centers  -- single-window centers providing online services to the public in rural areas where there is little or poor internet connectivity. Through the  Tele-Law  portal, people will be able to access lawyers - selected by the government in their state capitals - and seek advice on anything from land disputes to domestic violence cases via video conference. The law ministry said hundreds of village women will also be trained up as paralegal volunteers and will act as the first point of contact for rural citizens -- explaining the advice given by lawyers and assisting if further action is required. Their training will include understanding laws on social justice and fundamental rights, and will include women and child rights as well as labor-related legislation.  Tele-Law will fulfill our commitment to ensure access to justice and empowerment of the poor,  Ravi Shankar Prasad, minister for law and information technology, said in a statement.   The Common Services Centers and paralegal volunteers will offer easy legal advice to litigants in rural India making them digitally and financially inclusive.  An economic boom over the last two decades has lifted millions of Indians out of poverty and boosted literacy rates in the country of 1.3 billion, but access to justice remains costly and beyond the reach of hundreds of millions of poor citizens. Some of the major challenges include a lack of public awareness of their basic rights and entitlements, the limited reach of institutions providing legal aid and too few courts and judges, say activists.

Overhauling the country's infrastructure - roads, tunnels, ports and sewage plants, many of them built after 1970s when the construction boom started - is a looming burden on the government, whose deficit has already swollen to more than twice its GDP. Abe's solution is to sell public assets to companies or allow firms to manage them, which he argues would also help reduce the bulging deficit and generate economic momentum and jobs. Success here would be a boon to stalled structural reforms, which along with monetary and fiscal stimulus, make up his three-pronged approach, or the so-called  three arrows , to reenergize long-moribund activity. So far, Japan has sold the right to operate Kansai International Airport, serving Osaka, and Sendai International Airport in northern Japan. Cashing in on a tourism boom, the government is planning to privatise more regional airports. Now authorities aim to open markets for the water systems to private investors. But the plans are not getting much traction. Cities don't trust businesses to take over something as vital as water supplies. Nara, Japan's ancient capital, last year rejected a proposal to let a business operate its water works jointly with the city. “What we are afraid of the most, if the service is privatised, is that the new entity may stop proper water supply in some areas to seek efficiencies,  said Kentaro Shirakawa, a member of Nara's city assembly. So far, only Hamamatsu, a town in south central Japan, has picked a group of companies led by France's Veolia (VIE.PA) as a winning bidder to operate its sewage system - but not the hard part, overhauling the pipes. The obstacles highlight the difficulties Abe faces in carrying out deeper reforms he says Japan needs to put the economy on a sustainable footing as its population declines. An underground sewer facility is pictured in Tokyo, Japan June 8, 2017. Picture taken June 8, 2017.Toru HanaiHe envisions a 21 trillion yen ($190 billion) market of public-private partnerships (PPPs) by 2022 where businesses operate government-owned assets. So far, that market has reached 9.1 trillion yen, with the Kansai airport accounting for 5 trillion of that. Abe's government is urging cities to privatize their water works as replacement costs rise and their populations decline. An underground sewer facility is pictured in Tokyo, Japan June 8, 2017. Picture taken June 8, 2017.Toru HanaiAssembly members and local officials in some cities believe that privatizing will lighten the fiscal burden on their own dwindling resources.  By 2035, about 28 percent of sewer pipes - or 130,000 kilometers - will reach their 50-year lifespan. Replacement costs for pipes, pumps and other equipment are seen ballooning 66 percent to 1 trillion yen ($9.1 billion) over 20 years from 2013. Lawmakers in many cities, however, are concerned about whether private companies could provide services in the event of an earthquake, and what would happen if they went bankrupt. Opponents also argue privatization may result in job losses for the contractors that cities rely on now.  Cities have little incentive to privatize their water systems because they know they can fall back on the central government to bail them out if they run into a crisis, said Hideaki Tanaka, professor at Meiji University’s graduate school of governance studies.  For now, smaller cities and towns are waiting to see if such moves are successful in bigger cities. But most want to keep the status quo - even if they are in the red. In Nara, for instance, the water operations were already running a 200 million yen deficit each year.  They will probably leave the pipelines until they explode,” Tanaka said.

China's blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.2 percent, to 3,579.79 points by the lunch break, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.4 percent, to 3,151.25 points. Small-caps bounced back.

Although the size of any China rate move - likely confined to rates on open market operations - is expected to be modest, a tightening could exacerbate economic growth concerns.

A new regulatory framework under consideration by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) will instead require regional banks to ensure they do not take on excessive interest-rate risk when extending loans or investing in government bonds, he said.  We have absolutely no plan to uniformly restrict regional banks from holding government bonds,  Aso told parliament.  Be it bond holdings or lending, it's important for the banks to manage risks appropriately in doing business.  Aso said it was inevitable regional banks would continue to invest heavily in Japanese government bonds (JGB) despite very low returns, given weak corporate demand for funding and ultra-low interest rates across the globe.  Imposing a one-size-fits-all rule won't work,  he said, noting that the FSA will seek ways to nudge banks into boosting lending that cater to the varying needs of each region. The FSA will adopt a new rule for regional banks to guard against potential losses they could incur on their JGB holdings from sharp interest rate swings, people with direct knowledge of the matter have told Reuters. The Nikkei business daily, which first reported on the planned new rule, said the measure was aimed at preventing regional banks from relying too much on revenues from bond investment and to nudge them to boost lending. Regional banks have seen their profits hit by the BOJ's policy guiding short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year JGB yield around zero percent. But analysts warn of more structural problems that cloud the outlook for regional banks, such as a rapidly ageing population and a lack of promising start-ups in regional Japan.

The Saudi comments were in reaction to remarks by Qatar Airway's chief executive that the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were violating international law by shutting out Qatari flights. The airspace closure was within its sovereign right to protect the country and its citizens from anything it sees as a threat and as a precautionary measure, Saudi Arabia's General Authority of Civil Aviation said in a statement published by the Saudi Press Agency.  Similar statements were also issued by the UAE and Bahraini aviation authorities after a CNN interview of Chief Executive of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, who criticized the three Arab countries for the airspace closure. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar a week ago, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies. Al Baker had appealed to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency which administers the Chicago convention that guarantees civil overflights to declare the airspace closure as illegal. The UAE General Aviation Authority said it is fully committed to the Chicago convention, but the state reserves the sovereign right under international law to take any precautionary measures to protect its national security if necessary, according to UAE state news agency WAM. The three countries' aviation bodies also said non-Qatari private and chartered flights from Qatar must submit requests to them at least 24 hours before crossing the airspace. The request should include a list of names and nationalities of crews and passengers, and the cargo carried by the aircraft, they said.

That made Seattle's shutout defeat against the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday a bit of an anomaly. The Mariners made sure that didn't happen on back-to-back nights. Seattle's lineup exploded for 19 hits as it roughed up Adalberto Mejia and the Minnesota Twins by a 14-3 final in the series opener Monday at Target Field. Nelson Cruz drove in four runs, and Danny Valencia and Mike Zunino each homered as the Mariners (32-33) snapped a brief two-game skid. Mitch Haniger had a team-high four hits in just his second game back after a lengthy stint on the disabled list.  It doesn't happen very often where we get shut out,  said Haniger, who scored four of Seattle's 14 runs.  With the guys in our lineup, we're definitely looking to get on the board every game.  For the second time in a week, the Mariners won a game in which Yovani Gallardo started against the Twins. Gallardo didn't earn the decision last week in a 6-5 walk-off win over Minnesota, but he did on Monday. Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at TwinsSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchGallardo (3-6) allowed three runs in six innings to earn his first victory in nearly a month. Last Wednesday, he gave up five runs in seven innings against the Twins. In the Monday win, Gallardo struck out five and walked just one. He surrendered a pair of runs in the first inning but then cruised until allowing another run in the sixth.  Like I said throughout the year, I've been feeling great,  Gallardo said.  I've always said, I've just got to stay positive. Keep working on the things I've got to work on. ... I've just got to build off of this today and just keep moving forward.  Minnesota (32-28) continued its struggles in its home ballpark. The Twins fell to 12-19 at Target Field this season. Minnesota also yielded at least 13 runs for the second straight game. Mejia (1-2) gave up nine runs (eight earned) in 3 2/3 innings. Every player in the Mariners' starting lineup had at least one hit. It was the second lopsided win for Seattle over Minnesota in the span of a week. The Mariners beat the Twins by an identical 12-3 score in their series opener at Safeco Field in Seattle on June 6. Things got so bad for Minnesota on Monday that backup catcher Chris Gimenez came in to pitch the ninth inning. It was Gimenez's fifth relief appearance, and he allowed a pair of runs on three hits. Seattle didn't waste any time jumping on the scoreboard, and Mejia didn't help his own cause in the early going. Mejia's throwing error on a grounder by Haniger put two runners on base with nobody out in the first inning. Ben Gamel and Haniger came around to score on a two-run single by Cruz. That put Mejia and Minnesota in an early 2-0 hole.  It was one of his rougher starts kinda from the get-go,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said of Mejia.  Walked the leadoff hitter, and we've seen that a lot where it's really hurt us. And then he didn't make a play.  An hour after the Twins made the first overall pick in the draft, a former No. 1 overall pick tied the game for Minnesota. Joe Mauer hit a two-run double to left-center off Gallardo in the bottom of the first. Seattle answered with four more runs off Mejia in the second. Haniger drove in two of those with a ground-rule double to deep center field, and Cruz's sacrifice fly -- his third RBI in the first two innings -- made it a 6-2 lead. The Mariners got to Mejia again in the fourth, tacking on a run after Mejia loaded the bases. NOTES: Twins INF Jorge Polanco was reinstated from the bereavement list prior to Monday's game. Polanco had been out since Wednesday following the death of his grandfather. To make room on the 25-man roster, Minnesota optioned RHP Chris Heston to Triple-A Rochester. Heston pitched in just one game after he was claimed off waivers on Wednesday. ... Mariners RHP Felix Hernandez will make another rehab start with Triple-A Tacoma on Saturday as he works his way back from right shoulder bursitis, manager Scott Servais said Monday. Hernandez hasn't pitched for Seattle since April 25. ... Seattle INF Jean Segura (high ankle sprain) fielded ground balls on Monday at Target Field as he works his way back. Segura, who is batting .341 this year, last played on June 1. He is expected to continue to test the ankle Tuesday by doing some running before the game.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mariners-twins-writethru-idUSMTZED6DGOJYGO"},

In addition to the punishment against chancellor Phil DiStefano, two other prominent University of Colorado Boulder officials - head football coach Mike MacIntyre and athletic director Rick George - were ordered to donate $100,000 each to domestic violence prevention programs over their mishandling of the allegations. The punishment came after a closed meeting of the school's board of regents on Monday. The body met to discuss the findings of an independent investigation into the school's handling of domestic abuse allegations against former assistant football coach Joe Tumpkin by an ex-girlfriend.   We said at the outset of this matter that we didn't handle it as we should have, particularly in how we communicated with Tumpkin's former partner and how we reported the matter internally,  President Bruce Benson said in a statement announcing the punishments.  We will own our mistakes and own the solutions,  Benson said. DiStefano said in a statement he regrets not taking swifter action. MacIntyre said he accepts the school's decision. George said he takes  full responsibility  for his actions. Tumpkin was suspended in early January after news accounts emerged of the accusations. Tumpkin then agreed to resign in late January after a judge granted a restraining order against him.  According to school officials, Tumpkin's accuser, whose name has not been made public, contacted MacIntyre in mid-December about the domestic violence, two weeks before the team played in the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio. Tumpkin was charged in January with five counts of felony assault. He is free on bond. The reports of abuse and the subsequent investigation have rocked the state's flagship campus at a time when the long-losing Buffaloes were enjoying success on the gridiron. MacIntyre was named the 2016 Walter Camp Foundation's national coach of the year, as well as the PAC-12 conference's coach of the year. MacIntyre was set to receive a raise due to the team's success. The school's board of regents will take up the issue of the coach's pay later this month, a spokesman for the college said. Reporting by Eric M.

The  Tele-Law  initiative launched on Sunday will be piloted in 500 village councils in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and then rolled out across the rest of the country in a phased manner, said the law ministry. Villagers will access the service through newly established  Common Service Centers  -- single-window centers providing online services to the public in rural areas where there is little or poor internet connectivity. Through the  Tele-Law  portal, people will be able to access lawyers - selected by the government in their state capitals - and seek advice on anything from land disputes to domestic violence cases via video conference. The law ministry said hundreds of village women will also be trained up as paralegal volunteers and will act as the first point of contact for rural citizens -- explaining the advice given by lawyers and assisting if further action is required. Their training will include understanding laws on social justice and fundamental rights, and will include women and child rights as well as labor-related legislation.  Tele-Law will fulfill our commitment to ensure access to justice and empowerment of the poor,  Ravi Shankar Prasad, minister for law and information technology, said in a statement.   The Common Services Centers and paralegal volunteers will offer easy legal advice to litigants in rural India making them digitally and financially inclusive.  An economic boom over the last two decades has lifted millions of Indians out of poverty and boosted literacy rates in the country of 1.3 billion, but access to justice remains costly and beyond the reach of hundreds of millions of poor citizens. Some of the major challenges include a lack of public awareness of their basic rights and entitlements, the limited reach of institutions providing legal aid and too few courts and judges, say activists.

Data released late on Monday showed consumer inflation easing to 2.18 percent in May, helped by a drop in food prices - the lowest since India started publishing an economy-wide consumer price index in 2012. Inflation is now well below the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4 percent, and at the lower end of its CPI projection of 2 percent-3.5 percent in the first half of the fiscal year. The soft data has raised expectations that the RBI will cut its policy repo rate by 25 bps at its next policy meeting on Aug. 1-2, with some traders speculating a move ahead of that. India last delivered two rate cuts outside of scheduled meetings in early 2015 under the then governor Raghuram Rajan, when the country had not yet adopted a monetary policy committee to decide on rates.  They should do an out-of-policy rate cut. What is the point of waiting for two more months when inflation will further fall from here for the next two months?  said a dealer at a foreign bank, who was not authorised to talk to media. The new 10-year bond yield fell 5 basis points (bps) to 6.47 percent, its lowest since it was issued in early May. The existing 10-year benchmark bond yield was down 3 bps at 6.62 percent. The five-year benchmark overnight indexed swap , which closely tracks rate expectations, fell 4 bps to 6.21 percent. The one-year swap was down 5 bps at 6.20 percent. Shares edged higher, with the broader NSE index up 0.2 percent, led by gains in banks such as ICICI Bank. But the rupee was steady at 64.46 per dollar, compared with its previous close of 64.45. But not all analysts are convinced the RBI will cut rates. The central bank will get one more inflation data next month before its August meeting, after holding rates last week and warning that inflation could accelerate to 3.5 percent-4.5 percent by the second half of 2017/18. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates this week but questions are arising as to the rate hike plans for the rest of the year.  Given the RBI's balanced tone in June's review and reluctance to ease rates, we maintain our on-hold call on rates. But acknowledge that odds of a rate cut in Aug are rising. Stay tuned,  said Radhika Rao, an economist for DBS Bank in Singapore in an email to clients.

Foreign banks' exposure to China continues to rebound from its 2015 trough, driven by a pick-up in trade and improving sentiment towards the Chinese economy, among several other factors. Fitch Ratings expects a further rise in lending to the mainland in 2017, with tight onshore liquidity conditions likely to add to the incentives for Chinese companies to borrow offshore. Hong Kong banks have already reported a 10% qoq rise in Mainland China exposure (MCE) in 1Q17, compared with growth of just 6% over the whole of 2016. Total MCE of foreign banks rose by 5.4% in 2016 to USD1,669 billion, after falling by 14% in 2015, according to data compiled by Fitch. Growth in the second half of 2016 accelerated slightly, to 2.9% from 2.4% in 1H16. Hong Kong banks account for the largest share of foreign banks' MCE, at 48% at end-December, followed by Singapore at 7% and the UK at 6%. The UK's share would be 16% if it included the MCE of UK banks' Hong Kong subsidiaries. Hong Kong banks' MCE rose to 29.3% of system-wide assets at end-March, up from 27.3% at end-December. Rising interconnectedness between the Hong Kong and Chinese economies is driving growth now that the fall in FX-speculation-linked lending in 2015 has run its course. Client referrals from Chinese parent companies of bank subsidiaries based in Hong Kong remain a key source of growth in Hong Kong exposure to mainland borrowers. We also expect Hong Kong banks' mainland subsidiaries to grow as they expand their retail operations in southern China. These subsidiaries have become more active in mortgage lending in major Chinese cities, but this could slow as a result of the tightening of local regulations to cool the housing market. <iframe allowfullscreen src= //e.infogr.am/hong_kong_banks_mce_continues_to_rebound?src= embed  title= Hong Kong banks' MCE continues to rebound  width= 550  height= 676  scrolling= no  frameborder= 0 > Steady growth in lending to Chinese corporates and other non-bank borrowers - particularly private and non-mainland entities - is likely to continue, in part to support their expansion overseas. The non-bank segment accounted for almost three-quarters of Hong Kong lenders' MCE at end-March 2017. Claims on banks tend to be more volatile than those on non-banks, as shown by their 25% growth in the first quarter. The strong rise in 1Q17 could be an indication of a pick-up in trade-related growth, given that MCE to banks often takes the form of a Chinese bank's guarantee of corporate exposure. Exposure to banks accounted for 26% of MCE at end-March, up from a low of 23% at end-December 2016, but still well short of the peak of 43% three years earlier. Fitch continues to view China-related exposure as the biggest asset-quality risk for Hong Kong's banks, given that China's economy is highly leveraged and is going through a structural slowdown. That said, MCE has performed relatively well so far, even if the latest data show that the quality of banks' MCE continued to slowly deteriorate on average last year. A few banks have suffered above-average China-related losses, and some have scaled back their riskier onshore SME lending.

At one point, the Canadian dollar was at its strongest since April 17, at C$1.3274 per U.S. dollar, extending gains after climbing more than 1 percent on Monday. The loonie last traded at C$1.3293, up around 0.2 percent on the day. Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said on Monday first-quarter growth was  pretty impressive  and that signs economic growth was broadening would lead the central bank to consider whether current low rates would still be required.  She delivered a much more hawkish signal than we've seen from the central bank in some time,  said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy for Royal Bank of Canada's Hong Kong branch.  Bottom-line, odds of a rate hike by the end of the year from the Bank of Canada have moved up considerably,  Trinh said, adding that markets were now pricing in more than a 50 percent chance. Sterling was still looking wobbly after the shock result of Thursday's UK general election, which left Prime Minister Theresa May short of a parliamentary majority that would have strengthened her hand as Britain prepares for Brexit negotiations with Europe. The pound eased 0.1 percent to $1.2653, after shedding 2.3 percent the previous two trading days.  The prospect of further political uncertainty due to the lack of an overall Conservative majority is likely to weigh on sterling in the short term,  said Jeremy Gatto, senior vice president, trading, for Geneva-based boutique asset manager Unigestion. On the other hand, the potential for  softer Brexit  rhetoric in a market that is already short on sterling could help support the currency over the medium-term, Gatto added. The greenback was steady to firmer against the yen and the euro ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting starting later on Tuesday. Against the yen, the dollar held steady at 109.97. The euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.1193. With the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise interest rates, investors' focus will be on any fresh hints on the pace of tightening in the months to come, and its assessment of the economy and outlook on inflation. Investors will also be watching for any fresh details on the Fed's plans for trimming its balance sheet.  Given that the minutes (of the last Fed meeting) contained lots of details, one possible scenario is that there will be an announcement in June and that it will start in September,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist for Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, referring to the Fed's possible balance sheet reduction. Elsewhere, the Bank of England is set to announce an interest rate decision on Thursday, and the Bank of Japan holds a policy meeting on Thursday and Friday.

The Atlanta Braves right-hander had allowed three home runs and eight earned runs after not giving up a run in his previous two starts. With his team two outs from a loss, Foltynewicz watched on a television as his batterymate -- catcher Tyler Flowers -- lofted an opposite-field, three-run homer in the top of the ninth inning to give the Braves a thrilling 11-10 win over the Washington Nationals on a night eight homers flew out of Nationals Park.  He is a big strong man and he got it up there and it kept going,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said of Flowers.  It was awesome,  Foltynewicz said of the Flowers homer.  I didn't do my job. (The ball) is going to fly a little bit tonight. You have to keep the ball down.  That certainly wasn't the case for the Washington pitchers, as starter Stephen Strasburg gave up three homers in five innings. Reliever Jacob Turner allowed a homer in the eighth and Matt Albers, who has been a reliable arm in the bullpen, yielded the game-winner to Flowers. Washington entered the game with a bullpen ERA of 4.97, second-to-worst in the National League behind San Diego (5.00). The Nationals' bullpen gave up five runs in four innings to the Braves.  When you score 10 runs, you expect to win,  Washington manager Dusty Baker said.  There are no answers right now.  Related CoveragePreview: Braves at NationalsAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchThe Nationals have lost four in a row and have allowed 82 homers this year, including nine by Strasburg, six by Turner and three by Albers.  We are in a bad streak. We have to keep fighting,  Baker said.  Every team is going to go through it. It seems like we are getting beat by the homer.  Flowers was 0-for-4 with three strikeouts against Strasburg before he took a 2-0 pitch and sent it the opposite way into the Washington bullpen to make a loser of Albers (2-1).  It was definitely one of those games where you could have rolled over a few times there, just as they could have too,  Flowers said.  Lot of big hits early and throughout the game. Strasburg, I personally felt like he had really good stuff to me at least. The other guys did a good job of jumping on some mistakes.  The winning pitcher was Jason Motte (1-0), who pitched a scoreless eighth. Jim Johnson pitched the ninth for his 13th save despite allowing an RBI single to Trea Turner. Johnson got Bryce Harper to fly out to end the game with a runner on base.  I wanted to give us a chance to win. I was able to do that,  said Braves reliever Jason Hursh, who pitched a scoreless sixth and seventh. Matt Adams had three hits, including two homers, and four RBIs for the Braves, including a solo shot off Turner in the eighth that trimmed the Nationals' lead to 9-7. Ender Inciarte hit a sacrifice fly off Enny Romero to make it 9-8 and set the stage for the ninth-inning rally. Matt Kemp (two hits) and Nick Markakis also homered for the Braves. Harper, Turner and Brian Goodwin went deep for Washington. Goodwin, Michael A. Taylor, Turner and Adam Lind had three hits for Washington, and Matt Wieters and Daniel Murphy had two apiece. Strasburg allowed seven hits and six runs in five innings. He got his 10th strikeout on his 100th pitch as he fanned Flowers for the third time in the fifth inning.  It doesn't happen very often, especially the way he pitches,  Snitker said of Strasburg. The Braves (28-35) entered hitting just .121 in their last 33 at-bats with runners in scoring position. That was quickly improved upon as Markakis hit a two-run homer in the first with Inciarte on second base. Kemp, the next batter, crushed a 3-2 pitch into the bleachers in center off Strasburg to give the Braves a 3-0 lead. Washington (38-25) got two runs in the last of the first. Turner led off with a homer to straightway center and Harper, who followed with a walk, eventually scored on an RBI single by Wieters. Those runs broke a streak of 14 scoreless innings by Foltynewicz, who gave up 11 hits in 3 1/3 innings. Taylor had an RBI single off reliever Sam Freeman in the fourth to make it 8-6. Taylor then scored all the way from first on a single to right by Goodwin to give the Nationals a 9-6 lead before the Braves responded.  They just kept playing,  Snitker said.  They kept getting after it. It was good to see.  NOTES: The Braves took RHP Kyle Wright in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the draft. Atlanta SS Dansby Swanson, a product of Vanderbilt, was drafted first overall in 2015. Washington picked LHP Seth Romero, who was kicked off the team at the University of Houston in May, with the 25th overall pick. ... The Nationals called up RHP Trevor Gott from Triple-A Syracuse. To make room for Gott, the Nationals sent INF Wilmer Difo to Syracuse. ... Atlanta RHP R.A. Dickey (4-4, 4.73) will face Washington RHP Joe Ross (3-2, 6.16) on Tuesday. ... Washington has scored at least one run in every game this season.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-braves-nationals-writethru-idUSMTZED6DGUN9TG"},

Luisa Ortega, a former ally of President Nicolas Maduro who has turned against him and the ruling Socialist Party, has questioned Maduro's handling of opposition street protests in recent weeks and challenged his plan to rewrite a constitution brought in by late leader Hugo Chavez.   Somebody is threatening my family,  she said in a radio interview.  They harass them. They follow them, patrol cars that look like SEBIN,  she said, referring to the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN). State officials have launched a series of verbal attacks on Ortega, ranging from questioning her sanity to accusing her of promoting violence. She said she would hold the government responsible if her family was harmed. Fanned by anger at triple-digit inflation along with shortages of food and medicine, protests have grown smaller but more violent over the past two months, with at least 67 killed and thousands injured.  Ortega's office said it was investigating the death on Monday of a man called Socrates Salgado, 49, in a coastal town near Caracas. Opposition politicians said he died during a protest.  Inept  In April, Ortega successfully challenged a Supreme Court decision to assume the powers of the opposition-controlled legislature, making her the highest official in years to openly break with the ruling party.  She filed a Supreme Court challenge last week to Maduro's plan to elect a legislative super-body known as a constituent assembly, that will have the power to rewrite the constitution and in some cases dissolve state institutions.  Protesters crouch behind their shields outside a building housing the magistracy of the Supreme Court of Justice and a bank branch, during a rally against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, in Caracas, Venezuela June 12, 2017.Carlos Garcia RawlinsThe Supreme Court rejected the challenge on Monday.  The electoral chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice declares that the (challenge) filed by Luisa Ortega Diaz is inadmissible because it is an inept accumulation of pretensions,  the court said on Twitter.  In response, Ortega launched another legal challenge, this time claiming that 13 judges appointed to the court in 2015 were put there via an  irregular  process and that they should be replaced.  Protesters angry at the pro-government court's ruling on Monday attacked a branch of the court with petrol bombs and damaged a bank in the same building, which was engulfed in smoke and flames. Several protesters were injured as security guards tried to repel them.  Slideshow (19 Images)Police arrested 24 people for their involvement in the daylight attack on a busy office block, which was condemned by Maduro as a terrorist act. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles said it was the work of government agitators.  Outside the Supreme Court headquarters in downtown Caracas,  protesters backing Ortega were confronted earlier by government supporters. Maduro says Venezuela is the victim of an  economic war  that he says can only be addressed by a constituent assembly. The elections council has set an election for the assembly for July 30. The opposition is refusing to participate in the vote, saying it is rigged in favor of the Socialist Party. In a move seen as crimping opposition power, the Interior Ministry on Monday took direct control of the state police force in Miranda, a region that includes a wealthy part of Caracas. Capriles, a former presidential candidate, is its governor.  Citing the current constitution, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said the six-month  intervention  was justified because there was evidence the police force was involved in rights abuses and organized crime. Capriles said the plan was to use the police force to repress protests and said members of the force should not obey any order that violated human rights or the constitution.

China has been restricting real estate purchases across its cities to keep speculation in check and curb soaring prices, with banks also tightening loans to the sector.  Trading volume and average bids in the property market have been dampened which signals that Beijing's policy to regulate the real estate sector is working,  said Zou Mingdong, Shanghai-based steel manager at Zhongcai Merchants Investment Group. But the city of Shanghai appeared to alter a property policy on Monday following protests over the weekend. The most-active rebar contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was down 1.7 percent at 2,979 yuan ($438) a tonne by the midday break. The construction steel product touched an intraday low of 2,976 yuan earlier. Steel demand is also weak during summer in China, when hot weather in the northern parts of the country and frequent rainfall elsewhere limit construction activity. As steel prices slid, so did iron ore, with stocks of the raw material still plentiful in China. The most-traded iron ore on Dalian Commodity Exchange fell 1 percent to 426.50 yuan per tonne. Stockpiles of imported iron ore at China's ports reached 140.05 million tonnes on Friday, the most since at least 2004, according to data tracked by SteelHome consultancy. SH-TOT-IRONINV Port inventory has risen more than 26 percent this year.  High iron ore inventory will become a regular situation,  said Zou. Iron ore for delivery to China's Qingdao port .IO62-CNO=MB rose 0.9 percent to $54.87 a tonne on Monday, according to Metal Bulletin, tracking gains in Chinese iron ore futures in the prior session.
