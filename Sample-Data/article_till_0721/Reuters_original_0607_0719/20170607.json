Anderson hadn't allowed a run in either of his last two starts and kept right on rolling Tuesday, pitching 7 2/3 scoreless innings to lead the Milwaukee Brewers to a 5-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants at Miller Park.  Three starts, no runs -- that's driving the bus,  manager Craig Counsell said. He allowed a leadoff single to Denard Span to open the game but faced the minimum through four innings thanks to a pair of double plays from the Brewers' defense and a timely throw from catcher Jett Bandy, who caught Eduardo Nunez trying to swipe second base in the fourth inning. Anderson (5-1) would allow just four more baserunners on the day and gave way to the bullpen with two out and one on in the ninth, having allowed seven hits with a walk while striking out four. Related CoveragePreview: Giants at BrewersSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatch It's been fun lately, that's for sure,  said Anderson, who has struck out 22 while walking only four over his last three starts.  It's nice when your offense comes out and gets you a little lead. You can relax a little bit.  Giants starter Matt Cain's misfortune in the second helped Anderson pitch with an early lead. Hernan Perez led off the inning with his seventh home run of the season but Cain (3-5) missed a chance to get out of it when Eric Sogard doubled to shallow left field on a pop fly that Brandon Crawford, charging from shortstop, couldn't snare and instead fell between himself, left fielder Austin Slater and Nunez, the third baseman.  It's tough but that's part of the game,  Cain said.  There's not much you can do about it really. You make the quality pitch you wanted to, the guy puts a good swing on it and it falls in between three guys. There's not much else you can do about it.  Domingo Santana followed with an RBI double to put the Brewers up 4-0 and Cain went on to load the bases before finally getting out of the inning by getting Perez on a fly ball to center. He allowed one more run in the third, on an RBI double by Anderson, but kept the score there through five innings, finishing with 10 hits, two walks and three strikeouts.  When you have a hot hitter, it seems like those things fall in,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  (Crawford) went a long way but couldn't quite get it. It ended up being three runs, really, with the base hit after that so Matt had to work hard but he could have fared a lot better than what happened tonight.  With a comfortable lead in hand, Anderson settled in from there. He allowed just four baserunners over his final 3 2/3 innings of work and got two more double plays from the Brewers' defense.  The double plays got us tonight,  Bochy said.  Those are rally-killers.  Give the pitcher credit -- he's making pitches to induce ground balls and we hit a lot of grounders. We just couldn't keep it moving tonight. That was the difference from other games on this road trip when we've been scoring. When we haven't been scoring, usually there have been a lot of double plays involved.  Once again, the Brewers' bullpen made things interesting. Carlos Torres allowed three consecutive singles to open the ninth, spoiling the shutout bid. Brandon Crawford reached on a fielder's choice, driving in another run, but a throwing error on Torres put runners at first and second with nobody out. Milwaukee turned to closer Corey Knebel, who retired the next three batters for his sixth save of the year. NOTES: The Giants acquired RHP Sam Dyson from the Rangers for cash or a player to be named. Dyson began the season as Texas' closer but lost that job after blowing three straight save opportunities in April and was designated for assignment Friday, having posted a 10.80 ERA in 16 2/3 innings. ... Brewers 2B Jonathan Villar was out of the starting lineup Tuesday against the Giants as manager Craig Counsell went with hot-hitting Eric Sogard, instead. Villar has struggled from the onset of the season, batting just .207 while striking out 73 times in 56 games. ... LF Austin Slater got the start in left field for the Giants on Tuesday, the third of his major league career. He is the 12th player used in left by manager Bruce Bochy this season. ... The Giants have won 14 of their last 17 meetings with Milwaukee, outscoring the Brewers 109-46 in those contests.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-giants-brewers-writethru-idUSMTZED675PFIA6"},

Australia's gross domestic product growth came in at 0.3 percent in the first quarter from the previous three months, beating a 0.2 percent predicted by analysts to cap nearly 26 years of continuous expansion - equal to the Netherland's 103-quarter record. The S&P;/ASX 200 index was down 0.2 percent, or 12.874 points to 5,654.6 by 0317 GMT, recouping some of the 0.4 percent losses from earlier in the day. The headline GDP number and gains in consumption expenditure paint a positive economic growth outlook for the next quarter in Australia, said Ric Spooner, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. Globally, elections in the U.K., a potentially dovish stance by European Central Bank at its policy meeting and former FBI director James Comey's Senate testimony, all set for Thursday, could provide catalysts for investors. In Australia, the material and mining index was up 0.3 percent thanks to strength in gold stocks as the yellow metal surged to seven month highs. Newcrest Mining was up 0.8 percent, while Evolution Mining rose 1 percent. Rio Tinto was up 1 percent. The miner on Wednesday detailed pricing for a $781 million cash tender as part of its already announced $2.5 billion bond buyback to reduce its debt. A rise in copper on the London Metals Exchange also lent support. BHP, which has significant oil interests, was 0.6 percent lower as oil and iron ore eased. The energy sector, though, was driven higher by a gain of up to 5.8 percent by coal miner Whitehaven Coal Other energy stocks eked out modest gains as well ahead of inventory data from the U.S. later in the week. Woodside Petroleum, however, was 0.2 percent lower. The declines on the benchmark, were led by consumer stocks as Wesfarmers fell 3.4 percent, its lowest in nearly 7 months, while rival Woolworths was down 0.4 percent. The consumer sector has been pressured due to concerns about falling household spending as a property boom appears to be cooling off. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index was 0.7 percent, or 49.94 points, down at 7,445.03. The decline was broad-based with consumer stocks leading the losses as EBOS Group Ltd and Fletcher Building Ltd lost 1.7 percent.

The Los Angeles Angels closer allowed the Detroit Tigers to load the bases with two outs in the ninth inning Tuesday, then fell behind 3-0 to Alex Avila. Norris needed to make three perfect pitches to wriggle out of the jam, and he pulled it off. He struck out Avila looking to snuff out the threat, and the Angels snapped the Tigers' four-game winning streak with a 5-3 victory on at Comerica Park. Avila fouled off two fastballs before watching a slider go by.  Those (first) two pitches are big because you throw it down the heart of the plate and the game could be over,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  You walk him and you're playing with fire with the next guy. He had to make good pitches and got a foul tip, a foul ball and then a backdoor slider for strike three. He was able to execute some pitches.  C.J. Cron, who was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake on Saturday after an eight-game stint in the minors, hit a two-run homer. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at TigersLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch There's no doubt since he came back from the minor leagues there's a confidence level,  Scioscia said.  The swings are better. He can give us a big boost if he starts swinging the bat to his capability.  Kole Calhoun homered and drove in two runs for the Angels (30-31), who are 4-4 since franchise player Mike Trout tore a thumb ligament. Jesse Chavez (5-6) gave up two runs on seven hits in 5 2/3 innings while collecting the victory. Chavez pitched five scoreless innings but couldn't get out of the sixth, when he gave up four hits. He blamed his troubles on mechanical issues pitching out of the stretch.  I think I beat myself in that sixth inning, and that was just getting a little bit too quick,  he said.  It's kind of been the MO -- cruising to the sixth and then getting in that little rut.  Avila had two hits, including a solo homer, and scored twice for the Tigers (28-29).  Well, they didn't quit, there's no question about that,  Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said of his players.  (In the ninth, Alex) Presley and (Jose) Iglesias got on base, and (Ian) Kinsler followed with a walk. All the way to the end, we had a shot. They didn't let up.  Losing pitcher Daniel Norris (2-4) gave up four runs (three earned) on five hits while striking out seven in six innings. Daniel Norris issued three walks in the third inning.  Again, the stuff was good. The command was what caused him issues, and caused the pitch count to get up,  Ausmus said.  If he can control the ball, and keep the ball down, he probably pitches seven innings.  Kinsler, activated off the 10-day disabled list prior to the game after recovering from a hamstring strain, was 1-for-4 with a walk. The Tigers, down 4-0 in the sixth, scored twice on Avila's ninth homer and Justin Upton's RBI single. Calhoun's sacrifice fly in the seventh gave Los Angeles a 5-2 advantage. J.D. Martinez's sacrifice fly in the eighth made it a two-run game. Calhoun's ninth home run of the season, an opposite-field shot that snuck over the left-field wall, put the Angels on top in the first. Cron's second home run of the season, a no-doubter to left, followed a leadoff double by Yunel Escobar to make it 3-0 in the fourth. An error by Tigers center fielder Presley allowed Los Angeles' fourth run to score in the fifth. Following a one-out single by Andrelton Simmons, Calhoun smacked a single that skipped past Presley and allowed Simmons to come all the way around. NOTES: The Tigers optioned CF JaCoby Jones to Triple-A Toledo. ... Detroit C James McCann (stitches on left hand) was sent to Toledo for a couple rehab games before he is activated from the 10-day disabled list. ... Detroit RHP Justin Verlander had a clean MRI on Monday after departing Sunday's start in the third inning because of right groin tightness. However, Verlander's next start remains up in the air. His bullpen session Wednesday or Thursday will determine whether he'll make his next scheduled start in Boston this weekend. ... Angels RHP Cam Bedrosian (right groin strain) will make at least one more rehab appearance with Class A Inland Empire before he comes off the DL. ... Los Angeles RHP Huston Street threw a bullpen session Tuesday and will resume his rehab stint with Triple-A Salt Lake later this week. He was sidelined with a right lat strain during spring training, then suffered a setback during his rehab because of right triceps tightness.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-tigers-writethru-idUSMTZED675PFHA4"},

He was born in Cincinnati. He grew up a Reds fan, watching many of the greatest players to don the uniform of the first professional baseball franchise. On Tuesday night, he did something no Reds player had ever done, something only 16 players accomplished previously in major league baseball history. After hitting four home runs, including his second career grand slam, in Cincinnati's 13-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals at Great American Ball Park, the 27-year-old utility player stood at his locker and tried to put an historic night in perspective.  It's surreal, man, it really is,  said Gennett, who went 5-for-5 and tied a franchise record with 10 RBIs.  I'm truly blessed. Being from here, born here, watching all those guys when I was little, to do something that's never been done is ... I can't put words on it. It's an honor for sure.  Gennett is first player in major league history to amass five hits, four homers and 10 RBIs in a game, according to STATS, Inc. Gennett's grand slam came in the third inning off Cardinals starter Adam Wainwright. He homered twice off right-hander John Gant, in the fourth and sixth innings, then went deep off John Brebbia in the eighth. With the crowd on its feet with two outs in the eighth, Gennett took a called strike from Brebbia, then swung hard and missed to make the count 0-2. He lined the next pitch just over the right field wall, sending Great American Ball Park into delirium. Gennett made a pair of curtain calls and returned to left field in the ninth inning to a standing ovation and chants of  Scoo-ter  from the 18,620 fans in attendance. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at RedsSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatch I'm amazed by it,  said Reds manager Bryan Price, who was the pitching coach for the Seattle Mariners in 2002 when Mike Cameron went deep four times against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park.  It's very emotional. You've seen history. It's an honor to bear witness to it from the dugout.  Gennett, who was claimed off waivers from the Milwaukee Brewers on March 28, was mired in an 0-for-19 slump before he hit a two-run double in the seventh inning on Monday night. That double was softly hit to right. His first hit on Tuesday was a bloop to left that fell to drive in the game's first run.  That's baseball,  Gennett said.  That's why you never give up. Always try to get better and make adjustments. Our hitting coach Don (Long) has worked with me lately to kind of fine-tune some things. It did just that tonight.  The last Reds player to drive in 10 runs in a game was Walker Cooper on July 6, 1949, against the Chicago Cubs. While a throng of reporters gathered close by, Gennett worked with clubhouse staff to ensure that every uniform and equipment item was collected for transport to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. He also offered a light-hearted jab for reporters:  You guys weren't all here when I was 0-for-19. It's good to see you again.  Cincinnati (27-30) has won nine of its past 14 meetings with St. Louis (26-30). The Cardinals weren't in much of a mood to admire history.  I think we're all tired of making excuses,  said Cardinals manager Mike Matheny.  We've just got to change what's going on, and we will.  Overshadowed by Gennett's night was a solid performance by Tim Adleman (4-2). The Reds right-hander allowed one run and three hits while tying a career high with seven strikeouts over seven innings.  It's always nice to have Scooter Gennett on your team,  Adleman said.  It was big to go deep and give our horses in the bullpen a break.  Stephen Piscotty hit a solo homer for St. Louis, which has dropped five straight. The Reds pounded Wainwright (6-4), who tied a career high by allowing nine earned runs in 3 2/3 innings. Wainwright had yielded just one earned run over his previous four starts. Gennett started the scoring for Cincinnati with his bloop single in the first to drive home Billy Hamilton, putting the Reds ahead 1-0. Gennett was just getting started, and St. Louis would lament a couple of ill-fated decisions. In the third, the Cardinals challenged a ruling that right fielder Piscotty caught Eugenio Suarez's fly ball up against the wall in foul territory that resulted in a sacrifice fly to make the score 2-0. The ball clearly struck the padded wall before being caught, so the run was taken off the board along with the second out. Suarez walked to load the bases, and with one out, Gennett followed with a grand slam on a 3-2 pitch to make the score 5-0.  He had a career night,  Wainwright said.  He almost beat us all by himself.  The Cardinals would regret another decision in the fourth when they chose to intentionally walk Joey Votto to load the bases with two outs and face Suarez, who laced a bases-clearing triple to center, making the score 8-0. Gennett's two-run home run off Gant, who was making his Cardinals debut in relief of Wainwright, made the score 10-0.  For a little guy like me to do this is just short of a miracle,  Gennett said.  Baseball's an amazing game. You go 0-for-19, then hit four home runs in a game. It's pretty wild.  NOTES: Before Reds LF Scooter Gennett, the last major-leaguer to homer four times in a game was the Texas Rangers' Josh Hamilton on May 8, 2012, against the Baltimore Orioles. ... Gennett's last grand slam came on June 25, 2014, vs. Washington. ... Cincinnati LHP Tony Cingrani was reinstated from the 10-day disabled list and RHP Lisalverto Bonilla was optioned to Triple-A Louisville. ... Reds RF Scott Schebler was out of the lineup for the third straight day after straining his left shoulder making a diving catch on Saturday. He entered as a defensive replacement and later drew a walk. ... Cardinals 2B Kolten Wong (strained left elbow) began a rehab assignment with Class A Peoria on Tuesday. He is expected to be there at least three days.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cardinals-reds-writethru-idUSMTZED675NWH91"},

A Bucks County jury found Lee Kaplan, 52, guilty of 17 charges including child rape, statutory sexual assault, involuntary deviate sexual assault and indecent assault, the Bucks County District Attorney's Office said in a news release. The man, from Feasterville, a community just north of Philadelphia, was arrested in June 2016 on charges of raping a teenage girl who authorities said was given to him as a  gift  by her parents after he helped them financially. The sexual assault of the girl began when she was 14 and she gave birth to two of his children. Bucks County prosecutors in October charged Kaplan with sexually abusing the teenager's five younger sisters, after further investigations revealed they had been victimized as well.  The victims now range in age from 9 to 19, prosecutors said.  Kaplan is awaiting sentencing, which has not yet been scheduled. Deputy district attorney Kate Kohler, who prosecuted the case, said she hoped Kaplan will spend the rest of his life in prison, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. The trial, which began on May 31, featured testimony from all six of the sisters he was accused of sexually abusing. Kaplan for a time lived in the home of the parents and later returned to his own house in Feasterville where he lived with the girls he sexually abused, prosecutors said.  The girls' mother pleaded guilty to one count of endangering the welfare of children in April and her husband pleaded no contest to the same charge, according to CNN.

A drop in inventories could offer some support to benchmark palm oil prices that have fallen nearly a fifth since the start of the year on expectations of rising output.  The median forecast in the survey of eight planters, traders and analysts showed Malaysia's palm stockpiles at 1.58 million tonnes in May, a 1.3-percent drop from the previous month and the weakest May level since 2010.  Respondents said the decline came as overseas buyers stocked up ahead of the start of Ramadan in late May, when many Muslims break day-long fasts with communal feasting. Palm oil is commonly used as cooking oil or a food ingredient. Malaysian palm exports in May were seen jumping 13.6 percent from April to their largest in nine months at 1.46 million tonnes.   Exports in June, however, will taper off after the Ramadan demand,  said a trader from Kuala Lumpur.  Stocks are expected to rise as we are also expecting better production by then.  Output in May is forecast at 1.63 million tonnes, up 5.5 percent from April, the survey showed. That would mark the biggest level since October, but the smallest month-on-month growth so far this year.  That climb would also come below the historical May average monthly rise of 5.7 percent over the past five years, and below output levels in May 2015 ahead of an El Nino weather pattern, said Ivy Ng, regional head of plantations research at CIMB Investment Bank. Palm oil output this year is seen recovering from the effects of a strong El Nino, which damaged crops and reduced yields.  Plantation companies remain cautious on production prospects for June and are guiding for flat to negative output growth,  Ng said, with fewer working days in June and as workers go on leave during Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that marks the end of the fasting period. The median figures from the Reuters survey imply Malaysian consumption of 253,209 tonnes in May.  Official data will be released by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board after 0430 GMT on June 13.

The addition of the Chinese side means all five of the league's current teams will have to make the long trip to face Red Star in a three-game series each season.  For champions Les Canadiennes de Montreal, that involves a trip of some 12,500 kilometers. The league also has teams from Boston, Calgary, Toronto and Brampton (Ontario). CWHL Commissioner Brenda Andress said the decision to include Red Star was made with one eye on the Winter Games but also to increase the opportunities for women in sport. “This is a historic moment in time for women’s hockey to grow on a global stage, creating a template for many winter sports to follow heading into the 2022 Olympics to be held in China,” Andress said. “This is not just about hockey it is about the opportunity for the growth of women in all sports and creating career opportunities.” The CWHL season schedule has yet to be announced but will begin in October and see the number of games rise to 30 from 24.

Property developer Goodman Group easily bought back 96 percent of its $1 billion bonds from hundreds of U.S. investors, while mining giant Rio Tinto took back $781 billion of its notes in an oversubscribed offer, the companies said on Wednesday. While such offers are common in the United States and Europe, they are rare in Australia because there are not many corporate bonds on offer. Companies would rather borrow in the competitive bank loan market than issue bonds. Less than 15 percent of Australia's A$390 billion of non-government bonds are issued by corporate borrowers such as industrials, property companies and utilities. The vast bulk of that debt is issued by financial institutions and global organizations such as the World Bank. Local investors are so starved of corporate bonds that they spurn any attempt to return their cash ahead of schedule.  Bond buy-backs make balance sheets look better but if companies are not issuing more debt, portfolio diversity goes down and as we still have to re-invest the proceeds somewhere,  said Anthony Kirkham, head of fixed interest at Western Asset Management that has A$25 billion of assets. Some companies borrow to avoid the risk of having too little or even no debt on issue.  If investors loose sight of you, it could work against you,  said Nick Vrondas, chief financial officer of Goodman Group, which has around $1.7 billion of debt. Unlike its peers, Goodman and Rio, Crown Resort is targetting Australian investors with an ongoing offer to buy back subordinated debt. The offer is getting a lukewarm reception, having bought back a meagre A$126 million out of the proffered A$532 million since it opened in March. Not helping is a global hunt for yield in a low interest rate environment, and the return on Crown's debt is just too good to give up.  Crown is struggling because the subordinated notes offer great value to investors, with an annualised yield of around 5 percent,  said Damien Williamson, research analyst at stockbroker Bell Potter Securities. Last month, Crown could only buy back less than half of its A$450 million senior note issue. Western Asset Management's Kirkham said he declined to participate in Crown's bond buy-back because the price did not look attractive enough. Crown was not available to comment.

We expect most banks will have to raise capital to meet the higher requirements, particularly if they are pursuing rapid growth. The sector's capital needs could be exacerbated by deteriorating asset quality following aggressive lending in 2015/2016 to more vulnerable segments, such as retail and SMEs, the effects of the recent floods and weak internal capital generation. Our negative outlook on the Sri Lankan banking sector reflects these pressures, although banks have coped with the deterioration in the operating environment and loan book growth could keep non-performing loan ratios around current levels. Capitalisation is thin at state banks due to substantial dividend pay-outs. In 2016, the three largest state banks (National Savings Bank, Bank of Ceylon and People's Bank (Sri Lanka)) paid 76% of their profits as dividends. Their capital levels are vulnerable to dividend demands from the state, and continued high pay-outs in the absence of capital infusions could leave them struggling to meet regulatory capital requirements. Rapid loan growth by the private banks exceeding their rate of internal capital generation has weakened capital ratios. The sector's average Tier 1 capital ratio declined to 11.4% at end-2016 from 13.0% at end-2015, following high loan growth of 21.1% and 17.5% in 2015 and 2016, respectively, despite several contractionary monetary policy measures. The central bank increased policy rates in March 2017 in its latest attempt to curtail credit growth. Some large private listed banks have already announced capital-raising plans to support balance-sheet expansion in the next two years, but it may be challenging for the sector as a whole to raise large amounts given market conditions. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka issued the new local capital requirements related to the global Basel III regulatory framework in late 2016. Sri Lankan banks will have to maintain common equity Tier 1 (CET1) of at least 7.0% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs), Tier 1 capital of at least 8.5% and total capital (CET1, additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) of at least 12.5% by the start of 2019, compared with 10% under the current regime. Domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) will have to hold an additional buffer of 1.5% of RWAs. The central bank has said that banks with more than LKR500 billion of assets will be designated as D-SIBs and six banks meet this criterion. <iframe allowfullscreen src= //e.infogr.am/sri_lanka_banks___capitalisation_and_leverage _scores?src=embe d  title= Sri Lanka Banks - Capital Ratios  width= 750  height= 476  scrolling= no  frameborder= 0 > Pre-2017 Tier 2 capital instruments will be eligible to be included as Tier 2 capital under the new rules, subject to a 20% discount each year. At end-2016, approved Tier 2 capital amounted to LKR132 billion among Fitch-rated banks. Sri Lankan banks may start issuing Basel III-compliant debt instruments once clarification on the tax treatment of interest from listed debt securities is obtained. The government proposed removing this tax relief in its November 2016 budget, but a final decision has not been made. The central bank's new rules introduce a 20% risk-weighting for foreign currency lending to the government and a risk-weighting based on loan/values (LTVs) for gold-backed lending (20% for LTVs of 70%-100%; 100% for LTVs over 100%), which will put further pressure on banks' capital positions. Until now, these assets have benefited from zero risk-weightings.

The Sydney-listed owner of the iPrimus internet and mobile phone brand said KKR made an indicative cash offer of A$3.50 per share, a premium to its closing price the previous day but nearly two-thirds below its A$9.36 close a year earlier.  Vocus now must decide whether to accept the offer, wait for a rival approach or convince investors its own $2.4 billion takeover spree since 2014 will ultimately pay off.

It is an opportunistic first bid that might drive out any other buyers. Most likely Vocus will come out and reject it.  Vocus shares rose as much as 22 percent on Wednesday to match KKR's proposed buyout price, before slipping slightly amid doubts the Australian company would accept the offer. The broader market was flat. In a statement, Vocus said it would consider the proposal, which includes a condition that its board supports the offer unanimously, and urged shareholders not to take any action. A KKR spokesman declined to comment. While former national carrier Telstra dominates Australia's telecoms and internet market, smaller rivals like Vocus are jostling for exposure to a government-led A$40 billion ($30 billion) broadband network that is being rolled out around the country.

New World Development Co Ltd (0017.HK), which owns 72.29 percent of New World Department Store, is offering HK$2 apiece for all the shares it does not already own. That represents a 50.4 percent premium to the previous close, the department store operator said a filing to the Hong Kong bourse late on Tuesday.     Its shares climbed nearly 46 percent to HK$1.94, the highest since July 24, 2015.

The plaintiffs, Paul Bishop and Robert Kraus, had said the Wall Street bank had requested Federal Reserve loans on various occasions when it was in violation of certain banking regulations, in a complaint filed in 2011.

Several Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, cut ties with the tiny Gulf state on Monday over what they say is Qatar's support for terrorism, a claim Qatar vehemently denies. The United Arab Emirates had already said Qatari nationals would not be allowed to enter the country or cross its points of entry, although the practical effects on airline passengers had been unclear until now. Qatari nationals will now not be allowed to pass through airports in the UAE even to change planes.  UAE have banned Qatari nationals from transiting through UAE, so we're looking to see if that affects any passengers,  Qantas Airways Ltd International Chief Executive Gareth Evans said.  If it does, we will offer them (route) alternatives,  he told reporters on the sidelines of an airline industry meeting in Mexico. Emirates and Etihad Airways have not responded to multiple requests for comment about whether Qataris would be allowed to board flights taking off from or landing in their respective hubs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Emirates is a codeshare partner of Qantas. A visa check tool on the Emirates website provided by the International Air Transport Association said a Qatari passport holder would be refused transit in Dubai. In contrast, an Israeli national would be allowed up to 24 hours to change planes in Dubai even though the United Arab Emirates lacks diplomatic relations with Israel. Comment was also being sought from several other airlines that fly to Dubai and Abu Dhabi. OPSGROUP, an industry flight operations service, said it had advised airlines of a series of restrictions on Qatari nationals, including a ban on transit through the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The transit restrictions follow from the cutting of all transport links with Qatar as part of the coordinated action. The rift has affected global oil prices, hit travel plans and sown confusion among businesses. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain revoked the licences of Qatar Airways on Tuesday and ordered its offices to be closed within 48 hours, a move that analysts said would cost the carrier millions of dollars of revenue.

An Israeli military spokeswoman said dozens of Palestinians had gathered at the fence and were trying to damage it. Soldiers on the Israeli side of the border fired warning shots in the air after their calls to halt were ignored.  Residents in the enclave, run by Islamist Hamas group, said the protesters were throwing stones near the fence when the Israeli troops shot at them. Hospital officials in Gaza said a 25-year-old man was killed.  The Israeli spokeswoman said the military was looking into reports of a Palestinian fatality. At least 248 Palestinians and one Jordanian citizen have been killed since a wave of sporadic violence began in 2015 in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. Israel says at least 167 of those killed were carrying out stabbings, shootings or car-ramming attacks. Others died during clashes and protests. Thirty-seven Israelis, two American tourists and a British student have been killed in the violence, which has slowed in recent months but not stopped. Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005. The Palestinians hope to  establish an independent state including the enclave and the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian leadership have stalled.

It also demonstrates the administration's commitment to broader tax reforms that have the potential to improve fiscal stability and support an ambitious public investment programme. This package is the first component of a planned overhaul of the tax system that aims to raise revenue and achieve a simpler, more equitable and efficient system. A key goal of the overall tax reforms is to lower personal and corporate tax rates while expanding the tax base, resulting in a net positive gain to government revenue. The government has previously estimated that the full set of tax reform packages will together boost revenue by 2% of GDP by 2019, and it expects administrative measures that simplify tax bureaucracy to add another 1% of GDP to revenue over the same period. Low government revenue is currently a key weakness in the Philippines' fiscal profile - general government revenue was equivalent to just 22% of GDP at end-2016, compared with a median 30% for 'BBB' rated countries. The potential passage of proposed tax reforms was listed as a positive rating sensitivity when we last affirmed the Philippines' BBB/Positive rating in March. Some of the revenue-enhancing measures contained in this first bill were watered down to secure legislative passage, as was widely expected, and it still faces hurdles in passing the Senate, which could result in further compromises. Nevertheless, reported statements by the finance secretary imply the bill in its current form will add around 0.8% of GDP to revenue in 2018, not far from the government's original estimates of around 1% of GDP. Key provisions in the bill include a lowering of personal income tax rates, which should be more than offset by an increase in excise taxes on petroleum products and automobiles, an expansion of the VAT base, and the introduction of excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. Among the areas to be covered in subsequent planned reform bills are corporate, property and capital income taxes. The corporate tax rate is set to be reduced from 30% to 25%, which would bring it more into line with regional standards, while corporate tax provisions will be simplified in an attempt to increase compliance. The speed with which this first bill passed through the House - and President Duterte's intervention to give it a push over the line - suggests that tax reform is a priority for government. Indeed, tax reform is crucial to the rest of the administration's  10-Point Socioeconomic Agenda,  which includes plans to ramp up investment in infrastructure, health, education and social protection. Infrastructure spending is targeted to rise by two percentage points to 7.4% of GDP by 2022. It will be difficult to fulfil these plans - and also keep the budget deficit within the 3% of GDP target - without a medium-term rise in the revenue/GDP ratio.

With nearly 98 percent of returns in from polling booths, the candidate for President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Alfredo del Mazo, had 34 percent of the vote compared with 31 percent for MORENA's candidate, Delfina Gomez.  MORENA believes that Delfina Gomez won the election on Sunday and that she is the governor of the State of Mexico,  said Lopez Obrador.  The election was tarnished by piles of pig heads dumped on Saturday near MORENA offices and at polling stations in several municipalities, and accusations of telephone threats and fake electoral literature warning of attacks - tactics used to dissuade people from voting. Prosecutors are probing the situation.  We do not accept any result derived from electoral fraud, nor will we recognize any authority arising from the violation of constitutional principles,  said Lopez Obrador.  As of today we have asked the electoral institute of the State of Mexico to carry out a recount of votes. We want all votes to be counted, vote by vote, voting station by voting station,  he added.

We will not be provoked, we won't give those who are violent reason to accuse us of violence. We won't fall into that trap,  said Lopez Obrador. Encompassing many populous neighborhoods on the edge of Mexico City, the State of Mexico is home to one in eight Mexican voters and it has long been a source of strength and financing for the PRI.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have severed diplomatic relations and cut transport links with Qatar, which is set to stage the World Cup in 2022, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Korea are currently in the UAE for a warm-up match against Iraq later on Wednesday. They had been scheduled to take the one-hour hop to Doha on Saturday but with flights from Dubai to the Qatari capital suspended they have had to make other arrangements. The traveling party will now have to get a connecting flight in Kuwait, Yonhap News reported on Wednesday, which will add several hours to their travel time. However, Stielike did not see the travel hiccup having any negative impact on his side, who must win on June 12 to stay in the driver's seat for one of Group A's two automatic berths at the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia. Korea trail group leaders Iran by four points and lead Uzbekistan by just one, and must play both teams in their final two matches after the Qatar fixture.  It's going to affect us a little bit, but I expect there's not going to be a major problem in our schedule,  he said. The German said the stint in the UAE would help prepare his players for the conditions in Qatar and planned to give match time to some of those who had struggled for minutes at their club sides. Crystal Palace wide man Lee Chung-yong and Borussia Dortmund defender Park Joo-ho are likely to see action after playing bit-roles at their clubs last season.  We need to adjust to the weather and environment here and play a good game,  Stielike said.  Players like Lee Chung-yong haven't played many games, so I will watch how they perform,  he added.  We will be able to test which combination and which players will work the best for the World Cup qualifier against Qatar.

The greenback treaded water at 109.490 yen, not far from 109.225, its lowest since April 21 plumbed overnight. The dollar has lost 0.9 percent against the yen this week, also pressured by a sharp drop in U.S. Treasury yields to seven-month lows as investors sought the safety of government debt. The U.S. currency was seen coming under more pressure as previously bullish equities also began declining. Wall Street shares pulled away from recent record highs and fell overnight as demand for risky assets waned ahead of Thursday's events.  The dollar has felt the tug of lower U.S. yields for a while now, but buoyant stocks had helped neutralise some of that pressure,  said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.  But it lost even that support, and the dollar's fall gathered momentum.  Comey, who will testify on Thursday, was investigating whether Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia colluded to sway the 2016 U.S. election when he was fired by Trump in May. Investors are worried his testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's agenda of rolling back regulations and overhauling the tax code. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was a shade lower at 96.624 following a slip to 96.515, its lowest since Nov. 9. The euro was little changed at $1.1267 after climbing about 0.2 percent overnight. The common currency was still shy of the seven-month high of $1.1285 touched on Friday as a wait-and-see mood prevailed ahead of the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday, another of this week's major events that the markets are bracing for.  Super Thursday  While the ECB is not expected to shift rates or make changes to its quantitative easing scheme this week, market participants will sift through President Mario Draghi's statements for his view on the euro zone economy. Tempering expectations for the ECB to start planning an exit from is easy policy, Draghi said last week that while euro zone growth may be improving, inflation remains subdued and still requires substantial stimulus.  Of the three big events on 'Super Thursday,' the ECB meeting could be the least disruptive as participants have already had time to curtail their previously hawkish expectations,  said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust.  The remaining two, however, are political events. The markets are at their current levels because these events are simply difficult to read.  The pound was 0.1 percent lower at $1.2900 after swerving between $1.2951 and $1.2873 the previous day. Sterling has seen choppy trading on polls suggesting outcomes ranging from a majority for Prime Minister Theresa May's party to a 'hung' parliament in which no party has an overall majority. The Australian dollar added 0.45 percent to reach a one-month high of $0.7544 after data showed the resource-rich  economy grew 0.3 percent in the first quarter, dousing fears that its record expansion may have ended. No such boost was available to the New Zealand dollar, which traded flat at $0.7185. The kiwi was still close to a three-month high of $0.7206 scaled the previous day on the greenback's broad slide.

In the Kensington area of the northern city of Liverpool, a two-bedroom terraced house costs around 50,000 pounds ($64,600). In glitzy Kensington, London, a similar property could cost 100 times more.  What I know of Kensington in London is very different from the rough and tumble of here,  said Barbara Tickner, 87, who works in a church in Liverpool. The British capital's Kensington is famous for its parks, upmarket shops and museums that attract millions of tourists each year. Its multi-million-pound mansions house a cosmopolitan population, while royalty lives behind the gilded gates of Kensington Palace. The district in Liverpool receives few international visitors, although cheap housing has made it popular with students. Ahead of Thursday's election, locals there expressed worries over the economy and immigration. As they have for decades, the two neighborhoods are likely to vote in opposite ways.  London's Kensington has voted Conservative since the 1970s, and a precursor seat, Kensington South, was one of the party's safest seats in the years after World War II.  I'm voting Conservative, and being in Kensington, hopefully it's a sure vote. It always has been ... and I'm sure it will be,  said Sheena Williams, speaking in the bustling Churchill Arms pub.  She praised the area's quality of life:  We've got a very good police force, very good ambulance service. We're very lucky.  Williams also backed Prime Minister Theresa May's approach to Britain's forthcoming exit from the European Union, and said she hoped May would get on with leaving. Brexit negotiations with the bloc are due to begin at the end of June. In the referendum held a year ago, the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the city of Liverpool both voted strongly to remain in the EU. But the districts are otherwise poles apart politically. Liverpool Wavertree is a safe seat for the opposition Labour party and equally unlikely to change hands on Thursday, although some more marginal seats close to the city are being targeted by May's Conservatives. Drinkers in the Sheil Pub are less optimistic than their London counterparts, however, and local residents expressed disaffection with their circumstances.  A man walks along a residential street in Kensington in London.Hannah McKay Over the last 10 years, there's been a very big change around here,  said Steven Thomas, who owns a locksmiths on the high street.   I'm not against immigration, but it's just a culture change, and then the pubs go down, because no-one is using the pubs, and there's a knock-on effect.  Thomas said that while the local Labour party listened and did good work in the area, he was unconvinced by party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a socialist who has been accused of being out of touch with the party's core voters.  He's not really a leader,  he said. Ricky Gray, a customer of the Sheil, said he used to support Labour but hadn't voted for about 25 years.  I have voted before, but I would never vote again in my life. They don't do nothing for anyone.   Slideshow (23 Images)For Reuters photo essay, click reut.rs/2sztPLf Notting Hill London's Kensington has become increasingly affluent in recent decades, but not everyone is happy about the changes.  It's changed enormously. The area over there, Notting Hill, was a slum when I first got here,  said Pierce Carlson, 87, a U.S. citizen who moved to Britain in 1971.  You didn't want to live in Notting Hill back then. That's been improved.   But he said the main beneficiaries of government policies were the richest, who benefit from lower taxes, when more should be put into public services.  It depends on who they're doing it for. If they're doing it for Russian millionaires -- they're very happy. But the post office, the health service, they aren't sufficient, and they should spend money on them.  Even London's Kensington, where Russian and Middle Eastern billionaires have poured money into the property market, has pockets of poverty. The borough of Kensington and Chelsea contains areas that are among the 10 percent of most deprived  neighborhoods in the country. A woman who makes her living cleaning some of the upscale houses, and who declined to be named, said that politicians did not take people like her into account when making decisions.  If you're rich and you've got the money, they'll do anything,  she said.  We've just had enough. Everything we work for is taken away.

After police named two of the attackers and revealed that one was previously known to security agencies, Prime Minister Theresa May faced further questions about her record overseeing cuts to police numbers when she was interior minister. The latest opinion poll, by Survation for ITV, had the Conservatives' lead over Labour narrowing to just one point from six points in the same poll a week earlier.  However, the consensus among pollsters remains that May's party, who have been in government since 2010, will win a majority. In Britain's third Islamist attack in as many months, three men rammed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge on Saturday evening before running into the bustling Borough Market area, where they slit throats and stabbed people. The rampage followed a suicide bombing that killed 22 adults and children at a pop concert in Manchester two weeks ago, and an attack in March when five people died after a car was driven into pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge. One of the London Bridge attackers was 27-year-old Khuram Butt, a British citizen born in Pakistan. He was known to police and the domestic spy agency MI5 but, with resources scarce, had not been deemed enough of a threat to warrant close monitoring, police said. Butt had appeared in a television documentary called  The Jihadis Next Door , broadcast last year by Britain's Channel 4, one of a group of men who unfurled an Islamic State flag in a park. All three attackers were shot dead at the scene by officers within eight minutes of police receiving the first emergency call. The Canadian Christine Archibald, a French national and a Briton were among the dead, while other French people, a Spaniard, Australians and a New Zealander were among the 48 who were injured in what May called  an attack on the free world . Related CoverageFactbox: UK opinion polls - countdown to Thursday's electionThe family of 32-year-old Briton James McMullan said they believed he, too, had lost his life. Minute's Silence A nationwide minute of silence was held at 11 a.m. (1000 GMT) to honor all the victims. Before the recent attacks, Brexit and domestic issues such as the state of the health service and the cost of care for the elderly had dominated the election campaign. When May called the election in April, her Conservatives led in opinion polls by 20 points or more. People near the scene of the recent attack observe a minute's silence in tribute to the victims of the attack at London Bridge and Borough Market, in central London, Britain June 6, 2017.Toby MelvilleBut an announcement - made before the Manchester and London Bridge attacks - that they planned to make some of the elderly pay more for their care saw that lead start to shrink, to between one and 12 points now. Security has become the number one issue and both main parties issued statements on Tuesday portraying their own positions on policing and intelligence as the most robust. During a round of media interviews, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson faced a barrage of questions about whether there had been security failures and about past police cuts. He sought to deflect the pressure onto Labour, accusing them of weakness. Asked about repeated criticism of London Mayor Sadiq Khan's response to the attack by U.S. President Donald Trump, Johnson said he did not think there was any reason to cancel Trump's planned state visit to Britain. As interior minister from 2010 to 2016, May oversaw a drop of 20,000 in the number of police officers in England and Wales, which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said should never have happened and warranted her resignation. Slideshow (21 Images)The MI5 domestic intelligence service has seen its budget increased and has plans to expand its numbers to 5,000 officers from 4,000 over the next five years, MI5 chief Andrew Parker said last year. Corbyn himself has faced repeated questioning over his own past views and actions on security matters.  He has been criticized for voting against counter-terrorism legislation and expressing reservations about police responding to attacks with  shoot-to-kill  tactics. Since the attack, he has said he fully supported the actions of the police. Corbyn has also faced fierce criticism for past sympathies with the Palestinian group Hamas, Lebanon's Hezbollah, and Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, a guerrilla group that waged a violent struggle to take Northern Ireland out of the UK.  Almost Euphoric  While the political debate raged, the investigation into Saturday's attack continued, with police searching an address in Ilford, east London, in the early hours of Tuesday. Police had arrested 12 people on Sunday in Barking, also in the east of the city, but said late on Monday all had been released without charge.  The second attacker who has been named was 30-year-old Rachid Redouane, who also went by the alias Rachid Elkhdar and claimed to be Moroccan or Libyan, police said. He and Butt both lived in Barking. One of Butt's neighbors, Ikenna Chigbo, told Reuters he had chatted with Butt - known locally as  Abz  - just hours before the attack on Saturday and said he appeared  almost euphoric .  He was very sociable, seemed like an ordinary family man. He would always bring his kid out into the lobby,  said Chigbo. Police said they had to prioritize resources on suspects who were believed to be preparing an attack or providing active support for one. Butt did not fall into that category when they last investigated him.

Japan Display has posted three straight years of losses, hurt by fluctuating demand for Apple's iPhones. The company was created in 2012 by INCJ, combining the display units of Hitachi Ltd, Sony Corp and Toshiba Corp as a way of rescuing the country's teetering tech industry. INCJ agreed in December agreed to provide up to 75 billion yen ($685 million) to help the company. $1 = 109.4900 yen Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Edwina Gibbs","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-display-overhaul-idUSL3N1J41FC"},

EBA Investments plans to start the fund with around $1 billion to $2 billion to invest in a single project, Chen said. China Everbright Ltd's parent company, state-owned China Everbright Group, is a financial conglomerate based in Beijing.       Last time we closed a dollar fund was in 2010, but now we may start a new one,  EBA Chief Executive Eric Chen told Reuters in a phone interview. The firm currently manages around $6 billion of assets in China. The latest Chinese national policy encouraging companies to raise money offshore and invest in the country - which shores up the domestic currency - will support the fundraising, he said. Chen said when EBA raised the first dollar fund, foreign funds were generally negative about investment in China. But more recently, big international fund managers such as Blackstone Group (BX.N) and Warburg Pincus [WP.UL] have stepped up their investments, showing many investors believe in the China  value-added story , he said. The planned fund will initially invest into a single project because foreign investors prefer seeing the details and strategy of the specific projects before committing to invest, Chen said. The investment arm still has 6 billion yuan ($883 million) to deploy from a fund raised last year in the local currency. Chen said it may raise a new 10 billion yuan fund in 2018.      Besides top-tier cities, EBA Investments is also looking for more shopping mall investment opportunities in so-called second-tier cities and third-tier cities near major metropolitan areas, such as Xian and the southern city of Shunde, as rent incomes go up while asset values stay low.  The asset prices have dropped in the past few years due to fear of oversupply and competition from e-commerce, but we found out local consumption and operating environment are actually doing better than we originally expected,  Chen said.  Our tenants' business is good; children's education, gym and recreational activities see strong demand and they cannot be replaced by e-commerce,  he said. He added the firm usually exits shopping mall investments after five years by spinning off individual projects into securities such as real estate investment trusts (REITs), but costs could rise when market liquidity declines.

The Nikkei dropped 0.2 percent to 19,931.43 points by midmorning. It hit a near two-year high of 20,239.81 last Friday, breaking above the psychologically important 20,000-mark for the first time since December 2015. But trade was thin, with investors awaiting Britain's general election, a European Central Bank policy decision and former FBI director James Comey's Senate testimony all due on Thursday. China is also releasing a raft of data this week.  The overall market is quiet today and the market is especially focused on Comey's testimony,  said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities. He added that there is a risk of the dollar's falling against the yen if the outcome of Comey's testimony hinders U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed tax overhaul and his broader economic stimulus agenda. Comey was investigating whether Trump's presidential campaign and Russia colluded to sway the 2016 U.S. election when he was fired by Trump in May. On Wednesday, the dollar was little changed at 109.50 yen , failing to give the market a direction. Exporters were mixed, with Toyota Motor Corp falling 0.2 percent, Honda Motor Co dropping 0.6 percent and Advantest Corp rising 0.5 percent. Banks and insurance companies, which hunt for higher-yielding products, lost ground on falling U.S. Treasury yields. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group dropped 0.2 percent, Mizuho Financial Group shed 0.5 percent, and T&D; Holdings slid 1.1 percent. Bucking the trend, Japan Display Inc soared 8.7 percent after the Nikkei business daily reported the company will unveil a new medium-term plan by August under new management, to be appointed on June 21 at its annual shareholders meeting. The firm is scrapping a modest reform plan that failed to right the ship and is embarking on a wholesale reorganization, revamping domestic production sites and even exploring a capital partnership with a peer, the Nikkei said.

Temer's opponents see a court ruling as a way out of a political crisis set off by corruption allegations leveled against the center-right leader, but a decision could take weeks if not months and can be appealed by Temer. The case was postponed in April to allow for new evidence arising from Brazil's biggest ever corruption scandal involving billions of dollars in kickbacks paid by companies to scores of politicians and government officials. The court's decision is key to deciding the political future of Brazil, where the prospect of having a second president ousted in one year has generated political volatility. The uncertainty has weakened the Brazilian currency, stocks and bonds in recent days. Temer was the running mate of leftist President Dilma Rousseff and replaced her when she was impeached last year. If Temer is removed from office, lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia would take over and Congress would have 30 days to pick a caretaker to lead the country until elections in late 2018. Left-wing parties are calling for early general elections for Brazilians to pick a new president directly. Gustavo Guedes (R), lawyer of Brazilian President Michel Temer speaks with Flavio Caetano, lawyer of former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, before a session by Brazil's electoral court takes up 2014 case that could unseat President Michel Temer, in Brasilia, Brazil, June 6, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoIf Temer is found guilty, he is expected to appeal, which could delay the process for months. The government would likely destabilize and prompt members of his coalition to withdraw their support, increasing chances he could be forced to resign. The main ally in Temer's governing coalition, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), is waiting for the court ruling to decide whether to abandon Temer's government, which would sink his fiscal reform agenda.  The electoral court had been expected to blame Rousseff and absolve Temer, but that is now unlikely due to recent plea-bargain testimony by executives of giant meatpacker JBS SA (JBSS3.SA) and engineering group Odebrecht who alleged they gave illegal funds to his campaign. Slideshow (6 Images)Temer has refused to resign since the Supreme Court late last month authorized an investigation against him for alleged corruption, racketeering and obstruction of justice. The investigation is based in part on a secret recording of a conversation with a JBS executive in which Temer appeared to agree to the payment of hush money to silence a key witness in a massive graft scandal. The political crisis engulfing Temer's government deepened on Saturday with the arrest of a close aide, former lawmaker Rocha Loures, who was seen in a police video receiving a bag filled with 500,000 reais ($152,000) in cash. The Supreme Court has given Temer until Friday to answers questions by federal police on his conversation with the JBS executive and whether Loures was a middleman. Temer's political standing took another blow on Tuesday with the arrest of his former minister of tourism, Henrique Eduardo Alves, for suspected graft in the building of a soccer stadium in northeastern Brazil for the 2014 World Cup.

Women said on Tuesday. The African Women Leaders Network, which was launched last week in New York by the United Nations and the African Union Commission, hopes to drive more women into leadership roles, through mentoring, peer learning and harnessing contacts. By supporting women's leadership in Africa, the platform aims to galvanize their contributions to building and sustaining peace, improving political processes and driving social change, and realizing the U.N. global goals, according to U.N. Women. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), adopted in 2015, include targets on eliminating extreme poverty, providing clean energy, and tackling economic and gender inequality by 2030.  Peace and governance are big issues in Africa ... so we plan to harness women's leadership, experience and capacity to convince, mediate and make a difference in tough situations,  said Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, executive director of U.N. Women.  We invited women from opposing political parties within countries like Zimbabwe, to work on gender issues like violence against women in a united way that goes beyond party politics,  Mlambo-Ngcuka told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.   While Liberia and Mauritius are the only two African countries led by women, the continent accounts for seven of the world's 20 countries with the highest proportion of women in parliament, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU). Rwanda has the highest number of women in parliament in the world - at 61 percent - while the share of female parliamentarians in sub-Saharan Africa increased to almost a quarter last year, from one in 10 in 1995, the IPU said.   Yet in several African countries, recent elections saw a regression in the number of women elected to parliament, especially in those where there were no temporary special measures for gender equality, like quotas, U.N. Women said. Women lawmakers in Africa endure abuse, hostility and sexist violence in parliamentary offices and political meetings, as well as the newer arenas created by social media, activists say.  We will help women to participate in politics, to put themselves forward as candidates at local and national level, and support them in the face of intimidation and violence,  said Mlambo-Ngcuka, the former deputy president of South Africa.

The film, starring Israeli actress Gal Gadot, smashed box office records on its opening weekend, raking in more than $103 million in the United States - a record for a movie directed by a woman, Patty Jenkins. The film broke the previous record for a movie directed by a woman held by Sam Taylor-Johnson for  Fifty Shades of Grey . Online debates ahead of the film's release about the Amazonian superhero's lack of armpit hair and the furor surrounding her selection last year as a U.N. honorary ambassador, have only served to boost box office takings. But it is above all the depiction of the sword-wielding, lasso-tossing character as an empowered woman that accounts for the film's triumph, said Melissa Silverstein, founder of the Women and Hollywood blog and co-founder of the women-focused Athena Film Festival.  It's almost an exclamation point on what women have been saying for a long time - in the industry, outside the industry; that our stories matter, we are the heroes of the stories, we can kick butt as well as anyone else and we're equal,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. Wonder Woman was first imagined in 1941 as an icon of female empowerment - even appearing on the inaugural cover of the flagship feminist publication Ms. magazine three decades later. But her modern portrayal has been criticized for shifting to a sexualized buxom character, typically clad in a red, white and blue body suit. The United Nations dumped Wonder Woman less than two months after naming her as an ambassador for women's and girls' empowerment amid criticism that her pin-up image sent the wrong message. The film reverts to her original incarnation.  Wonder Woman  is one of three comic-book superheroes from the 1930s and 1940s whose stories have been published almost without interruption - alongside Batman and Superman - according to Harvard history professor Jill Lepore.  Yet, Jenkins' film is the first theatrical release starring the Princess of the Amazons. Her debut on the silver screen has prompted a host of celebratory initiatives. In New York,  Wonder Woman  enthusiasts have raised more than $8,000 in six days to send high-school girls to a screening in Washington D.C. And female-only showings by the cinema chain Alamo Drafthouse have sold out from Austin, Texas, to New York, with promises of proceeds going to Planned Parenthood, a women's healthcare provider. Silverstein said the blockbuster should herald a new era in a Hollywood film industry skewed in favor of male characters and filmmakers. Last year, females comprised just 29 percent of protagonists among the 100 top-grossing U.S. films, according to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, California. Behind the scenes, women made up just 7 percent of directors working on the top 250 domestic grossing films in 2016, a study by the same center shows.  The bigger picture is, for me, that women stories are as valid as male stories,  said Silverstein. Reporting by Sebastien Malo, Editing by Emma Batha.

(Reuters) - An Oregon grand jury on Tuesday returned a 15-count indictment against an ex-convict accused of harassing two African-American girls, one wearing a Muslim head scarf, then stabbing three men who intervened, killing two of them, aboard a Portland commuter  train. The suspect, Jeremy Christian, 35, who served time for a 2002 armed robbery conviction, was initially charged in a criminal complaint last week with nine felony counts from the bloody May 26 incident. The indictment contains five additional counts and spares prosecutors the procedural step of having to present their case to a judge in a preliminary hearing to show they have sufficient cause to proceed to trial. Christian is due to appear in court on Wednesday for an arraignment on the charges - two counts of aggravated murder, one count of attempted murder and multiple counts of assault, unlawful use of a weapon, intimidation and menacing. Christian is accused of yelling racial and ethnic epithets at two teenage girls, both black and one wearing traditional Muslim dress, before several fellow passengers stepped in to confront him.  His tirade, according to an affidavit filed by prosecutors in the case, included the comments:  I don't care if you are ISIS  - an apparent reference to Islamic State - and  Free speech or die.  Prosecutors say Christian then pulled out a knife and slashed three men in their necks before fleeing the train when it stopped. One victim stumbled to his death on a station platform and another died in the rail car where he was stabbed. The third wounded man survived. Christian was arrested a short time later and jailed without bond in the attack, which the FBI has been investigating as a possible federal hate crime. The Southern Poverty Law Center has reported finding  racist and other extremist  ideology posted on Christian's Facebook account. The attack became an undercurrent in dueling rallies staged in Oregon's largest city on Sunday by supporters of President Donald Trump and counter-demonstrators who said his divisive political rhetoric was encouraging acts of racial and ethnic hatred. Christian was said by anti-Trump activists to have taken part in a previous pro-Trump rally in east Portland in April, although sponsors of that protest denied he was part of their movement. Prosecutors say Christian confessed to the train stabbings in a profanity-laced rant recorded in the back of a police vehicle after he was taken into custody. In his initial appearance before a judge four days after the attacks, he entered the courtroom shouting,  Free speech or die, Portland ... This is America - get out if you don't like free speech.

Judge Joan Lefkow said she will rule on a motion by healthcare advocates concerned that Illinois' ongoing budget impasse and its resulting backlog of nearly $14.7 billion in unpaid bills is harming Medicaid recipients' access to medical care. David Chizewer, a lawyer representing the recipients, told Lefkow earlier on Tuesday that a court determination giving precedence to Medicaid payments could lead to a compromise with the state over the next few days. Otherwise, the plaintiffs are asking the court to begin contempt proceedings against the nation's fifth-largest state. Illinois officials have warned that an increase in priority payments could push the cash-strapped state to the point where court-mandated spending could exceed available revenue. Each month, priority payments of $1.85 billion are allocated to schools, local governments, payroll, bonds and consent decrees, consuming 90 percent of Illinois' monthly revenue, according to a court document filed by the state. Both sides told Lefkow on Tuesday that they failed to reach a compromise on speeding money to managed-care organizations participating in the Medicaid program, which provides health services to 3 million poor and disabled Illinois residents. The plaintiffs are from cases dating back to 1992 and that resulted in federal consent decrees requiring the state to continue to make Medicaid payments despite its budget problems. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers ended their spring session last week without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois' credit ratings from S&P; and Moody's Investors Service to a step above junk. Brent Stratton, an assistant Illinois attorney general, said the issue is not that the state is unwilling to pay Medicaid providers, but that it is unable to pay them promptly. He told the judge that missing  high priority  payments on Illinois' roughly $30 billion of general obligation bonds would result in a default, while skipping payments to public school districts could force some to shut down. S&P; has warned that Illinois' budget crisis could lead to bond payments being squeezed out by other spending priorities.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/illinois-budget-idUSL1N1J4020"},

Police shot dead gunman Yacqub Khayre, who they said had a long criminal history, on Monday night after he killed a man in an apartment block in Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city, and held a woman hostage for several hours.  Attorney-General George Brandis said it was clear that Khayre, 29, who was granted parole in November after being convicted over a violent home invasion, should never have been released from prison.   I think the public are entitled to expect that people who present that level of danger to the public, and who have a terrorism background, there should be a presumption against bail or parole except in a very clear case,  Brandis told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio on Wednesday.  Brandis and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull both launched  stinging criticism of state governments, which are responsible for parole laws, in the wake of the Melbourne attack.  Police are treating the siege as an  act of terrorism  after Islamic State claimed one of its fighters was responsible. Senior officials said Khayre had been acquitted of a plot to attack a Sydney army base in 2009. He was also accused of traveling to Somalia, where he was born, to seek a religious ruling in support of the planned 2009 attack. Brandis said Turnbull would push state leaders to alter who is responsible for parole decisions at a meeting of state and federal governments on Friday, including having decisions made by state attorneys general rather than parole boards in cases involving extremism. Australia passed laws last year allowing the indefinite detention of anyone convicted of terror-related offences if authorities believed that person posed a threat after their release. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said Khayre had been complying with his bail conditions, which included drug testing and a curfew, before Monday's siege. However, Andrews said he would consider changes to parole laws. Khayre's attack echoed a deadly 2014 siege in a Sydney cafe, during which several people were held hostage for more than 17 hours by a gunman who was on bail after being charged with sexual assault and being an accessory to murder. A coroner last month criticized  inadequate  opposition to the gunman's application for bail in that case. New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, introduced stricter bail laws in response to the Sydney siege.

Cocobod Chief Executive Joseph Boahen Aidoo said around 23 percent of Ghana's cocoa tree stock, covering some 411,000 hectares, is over 30 years and had become unproductive.      What it means is that at least 40 percent of Ghana's cocoa stock is not producing and it's a challenge we must resolve to sustain production in future,  Aidoo told journalists in Accra. The government of President Nana Akufo-Addo aims to raise production to 1 million tonnes by 2020, from the current annual output of 800,000 tonnes. Aidoo said to achieve the target, Cocobod was seeking funding to undertake an extensive rehabilitation of farms, to be complemented by a hand pollination program to be launched next week.  Ghana might not pay annual bonuses to cocoa farmers this year due to a drop in global prices which had cost Cocobod around $1 billion in the last two years, Aidoo said.  Cocobod said last month it would maintain the producer price paid to farmers despite the price fall. Top grower Ivory Coast slashed its price for cocoa farmers by 36 percent and reduced taxes for the April-to-September mid-crop.  Considering the current level of (world) prices, we believe we are paying $400 more per tonne to our farmers. It is a tight situation and we may not be able to pay bonuses this year,  Aidoo said.

Delaware's legislation aims to codify at the state level the provisions of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision that protects a woman's right to abortion.  Trump, a Republican whose election was backed by anti-abortion groups, has promised to appoint justices to the nation's top court who would overturn Roe v. Wade and let states decide whether to legalize abortion. The Delaware state House, after more than five hours of debate and discussion, voted 22 to 16 on Tuesday to approve the measure, according to the website for the state legislature. The measure had already passed in the state Senate.   Both chambers of the Delaware legislature are controlled by Democrats, and Governor John Carney Jr. also is a Democrat. Passage of the bill through the House positions Delaware to potentially become the first state to guarantee access to abortion since Trump was elected president.  Carney, who has been following debate on the bill, has not yet said if he will sign it into law, his spokeswoman Jessica Borcky said.   But the governor supports the rights and protections afforded women under Roe v. Wade,  Borcky said.  Abortion opponents lobbied against the legislation, concerned it could turn Delaware into  a late-term abortion haven,  said Delaware Right to Life spokeswoman Moira Sheridan. Her group plans to take its fight to the governor's office.  We will exert the same pressure upon Governor Carney, a Catholic, to uphold the sanctity of life for those innocent unborn children whose lives depend upon his vetoing this radical bill,  Sheridan said. A bill to support abortion rights was approved by the Illinois legislature in May but the state's Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, has vowed to veto it. In January, New York's Assembly adopted legislation similar to Delaware's, but it has stalled in the Senate.

Brent crude futures were trading at $49.94 per barrel at 0041 GMT, down 18 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. Brent is almost 8 percent below it levels on May 25, when an OPEC-led policy to cut oil output was extended to cover the first quarter of 2018. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $47.98 per barrel, down 21 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their previous close, and down over 6 percent from May 25. Traders said an ongoing fuel supply overhang was keeping prices under pressure despite a pledge led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to hold back almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of production until the first quarter of 2018. World fuel production and consumption is roughly in supply and demand balance, at almost 98 million bpd, although inventories remain somewhat bloated, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Traders said the market was supported by heightened political tensions in the Middle East and by signs of a gradual drawdown of bloated fuel inventories in the United States. Commodities brokerage Marex Spectron said it expects  lower supply of crude oil on the physical market  in the coming weeks, adding that  this is likely to provide support to the price  of oil. A campaign by leading Arab powers, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, to isolate Qatar is disrupting trade in commodities from oil, natural gas, metals, and food. In the United States, U.S. crude inventories fell by 8.7 million barrels in the week to May 26, data from the American Petroleum Institute showed late on Tuesday. Official data by the EIA will be published later on Wednesday. Marex Spectron said that the demand outlook for coming weeks from refineries was strong, also supporting prices. However, the brokerage said that price gains could be capped by what it called a  deeply bearish  macro-economic environment.

The greenback was little changed at 109.420 yen, not far from 109.225, its lowest since April 21 plumbed overnight. The dollar has lost 0.9 percent against the yen this week, also pressured by a sharp drop in U.S. Treasury yields to seven-month lows as investors sought the safety of government debt. The U.S. currency was seen coming under more pressure as previously bullish equities also began declining. Wall Street shares pulled away from recent record highs and fell overnight as demand for risky assets waned ahead of Thursday's events.  The dollar has felt the tug of lower U.S. yields for a while now, but buoyant stocks had helped neutralise some of that pressure,  said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.  But it lost even that support, and the dollar's fall gathered momentum.  Comey, who will testify on Thursday, was investigating whether Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia colluded to sway the 2016 U.S. election when he was fired by Trump in May. Investors are worried his testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's agenda of rolling back regulations and overhauling the tax code. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was a shade lower at 96.598 following a slip to 96.515, its lowest since Nov. 9. The euro was little changed at $1.1268 after climbing about 0.2 percent overnight. The common currency was still shy of the seven-month high of $1.1285 touched on Friday as a wait-and-see mood prevailed ahead of the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday, another of this week's major events that the markets are bracing for. While the ECB is not expected to shift rates or make changes to its quantitative easing scheme this week, market participants will sift through President Mario Draghi's statements for his view on the euro zone economy.

The vast, arid zone has in recent years become a breeding ground for jihadist groups - some linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State - that European nations, particularly France, fear could threaten Europe if left unchecked.  We cannot afford to let the Sahel region become a new safe haven for terrorists across the world,  French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre told reporters.  France circulated a draft Security Council resolution on Tuesday to the 15-member body to authorize the West African force to use  all necessary means  to restore peace and security in accordance with international law and work in coordination with a U.N. peacekeeping mission and French forces in Mali. The West African force would also  contribute as necessary to the restoration of state authority and the return of displaced persons and refugees  and facilitate humanitarian operations and the delivery of aid.  Diplomats said the resolution could be voted on next week.  It would be irresponsible for the council not to come together behind this regional initiative to combat terrorism across borders at the moment when the threat has never been so high,  Delattre said. The draft also requests U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres report to the council within 60 days on options for United Nations support for the West Africa force, known as the FC-G5S. He would also report every three months on the force. The European Union has committed $56 million to the Sahel force. Last year, the Sahel nations - Niger, Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania - proposed establishing special units, each of around 100 well-trained soldiers, which would be deployed in areas where jihadist groups are known to operate. They would complement the efforts of regular armed forces, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali and France's Operation Barkhane, which has around 4,000 troops deployed across the five Sahel countries. France intervened in 2013 to drive back militants who had seized northern Mali a year earlier. However, militants continue to attack security forces and civilian in Mali and its neighbors.

Comey's highly anticipated appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday could be a turning point in a controversy that has rocked Trump's young administration. In his first public remarks since Trump fired him last month, Comey is expected to tell the Senate Intelligence committee that Trump asked him during a meeting in the Oval Office to end the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia. Comey may also detail other conversations with Trump.  Two legal experts said Comey would seek to avoid compromising a new inquiry led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller or separate congressional investigations.  I would expect him to hew pretty closely to facts and events,  said Jack Sharman, a partner at Lightfoot, Franklin and White and former special counsel to a congressional committee that investigated President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Another source, who asked not to be named, said Comey does not see it as his role to charge the president or anyone else with obstruction of justice or any other crime. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, but to affect the election's outcome. Comey told the House of Representatives intelligence committee on March 20 that the FBI was probing Moscow's role in the election, including possible Trump campaign collusion. Trump fired Comey on May 9, a step that stunned Washington and intensified scrutiny of the matter. Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about contacts Flynn had with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. Federal prosecutors last month issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen.  The Senate intelligence panel also issued its first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. The first roughly 600 pages of those documents were delivered on Tuesday.

Uber fired the staff following a report by law firm Perkins Coie, which Uber hired to look into claims of harassment, discrimination, bullying and other employee concerns. The law firm has been working in parallel with a broader investigation by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder into company culture and practices. Perkins Coie investigated 215 staff complaints going back as far as 2012, Uber said, taking action in 58 cases and no action on 100 more. Other investigations are continuing. Of the 215 claims, Uber said 54 were related to discrimination, 47 related to sexual harassment, 45 to unprofessional behavior, 33 to bullying and 36 to other types of claims. It said the majority of the claims came from employees based at Uber's San Francisco headquarters. The world's highest-valued venture-backed company - worth $68 billion at its last funding round - also told staff on Tuesday it would expand its employee relations unit to better investigate claims and that it would dramatically increase management training since most Uber managers were first-time bosses, a person familiar with the matter said. On Monday, Uber said it hired Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei to train all managers, reporting to Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick. On Tuesday, it said Bozoma Saint John, prominent in some Apple Inc (AAPL.O) product launches, joined the company as chief brand officer. Uber also said it is offering a confidential helpline for employees to report concerns and has implemented a system to log and track all complaints. Year of Questions  Uber's firing of employees comes after a series of events this year that have raised questions about Uber's business model and leadership.  In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler said in a widely read blog post that managers and human resources officers had not punished her manager after she reported his unwanted sexual advances. In addition, Uber was caught using technology to avoid regulator crackdowns, a video surfaced showing Kalanick berating an Uber driver, and the company is caught up in legal battles around the world over the way its ride-services business operates.  Uber is also facing a lawsuit from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) self-driving car division, Waymo, alleging trade secret theft. The company declined to comment further on the move to fire staff. Some saw it as a step in the right direction for Uber to repair its tarnished reputation.  They are heading the right way, both with action and reaction,  said Jason Hanold, manager partner at human resources executive recruitment firm Hanold Associates. He added it was  not nearly a complete and final surgery to heal a troubled culture.  The move follows a string of executive departures at Uber, including the company president, heads of finance and product, an East Coast general manager and several high-level engineers. For the last three months, Uber has been seeking a chief operating officer to work alongside Kalanick, who has earned a reputation as a pugnacious leader. Uber board member Bill Gurley is overseeing the search. Uber has also been under the microscope of Holder and Tammy Albarran, partners at the law firm Covington & Burling, who were asked to conduct a broad review of sexual harassment at Uber as well as general questions about diversity and inclusion. Their report was completed at the end of May and has been shared with a subcommittee of the Uber board of directors, a company representative said.  In March, Uber board member Arianna Huffington pledged to make the findings of Holder's investigation available to the public. Initially, the company had expected to make a public announcement this week, but that timing has been pushed back. Uber is expected to discuss it with staff next week, a person familiar with the matter said.

The move looks like it might pay off as the center now stands just two wins shy of becoming a champion in a league more used to standout players from the southern U.S. state of the same name. Basketball rivals soccer and rugby for the top spot on Georgia's sports hierarchy and Pachulia, the NBA's only active player from the former Soviet republic, is among the most adored athletes in the Caucasian nation. And that popularity will only increase if Golden State, who lead the reigning champion Cleveland Cavaliers 2-0 in the NBA Finals, close out the best-of-seven series in the coming days.  Georgia is a very small country, compared to the U.S., only 3.5 million people, but a lot of basketball,  Pachulia, 33, told reporters on Tuesday in Cleveland.  Basketball is in our DNA. It's been here for years, for years and years and generations. We have pretty successful players throughout history. Basketball's definitely a very important Georgian sport.  Last year Pachulia, tired of never having even reached a conference final, turned down richer contracts in favor of joining a talent-rich Golden State team he knew would give him his best shot at winning a maiden NBA title in his 14th season. With the Georgian big man on board, the Warriors have cruised to the league's best record and enjoyed a 14-0 start to the postseason. Pachulia has been a key factor in their success, providing a hard-nosed toughness inside and plenty of energy while focusing on rebounding, defending the paint and setting screens for his higher-profile team mates. He has represented the Georgian national team nearly every offseason for years and also been very active in promoting the game back home, where many will be watching when the series resumes in Cleveland on Wednesday.  I know that my country has my back and they have supported me throughout the years, and especially this time in my career I have a chance to do something special for my country and become a world champ,  said Pachulia.  They're anxiously watching and supporting and cheering for our team, so I'm really lucky and feel very privileged to represent my country.

Sugar producers in the United States refused to endorse the agreement in principle between the two governments after pushing for even more concessions from Mexico, raising the possibility that the deal could collapse. The agreement in principle between U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo aims to resolve a long-standing trade dispute between the two countries. Without it, the United States could have reimposed steep import duties on its southern neigbour and risked the prospect of a retaliation from Mexico just as the two countries and Canada prepare to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement this year. Under the deal, Mexico would sharply reduce the share of refined sugar it exports to the United States and increase raw sugar exports.  We have gotten the Mexican side to agree to nearly every request made by U.S. industry to address flaws in the current system and ensure fair treatment of American sugar growers and refiners,  Ross told a news conference. Still, Ross said the U.S. sugar producers had told him that they could not accept the deal in its current form, but he hoped that they would agree to some changes in a final drafting of the agreement in the next several days.  He did not elaborate on what action the Commerce Department would take if there were no final agreement with the U.S. producers. It was unclear if Ross would impose the settlement if U.S. producers did not sign onto it. Related CoverageU.S. sugar producers concerned about 'loophole' in U.S.-Mexican pactThe agreement lifts the minimum prices for Mexican imports, which will likely be passed on by U.S. sugar refiners to food companies and beverage and confectionary producers and ultimately to consumers. A trade group that represents a coalition of U.S. sugar buyers and other firms that are critics of the U.S. program said the deal favored the interests of U.S. sugar producers, and estimated the cost to the consumers in higher prices for food, drinks and confectionary at around $1 billion.  Today's announcement is a bad deal for hardworking Americans, and exemplifies the worst form of crony capitalism,  the U.S. Coalition for Sugar Reform said in a statement. The negotiations were an attempt to settle an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy case brought by a coalition of cane and beet farming groups and ASR Group, the maker of Domino Sugar that is owned by the politically well-connected Fanjul family of Florida. Workers spray fertilizer in a sugar cane field in Zacatepec de Hidalgo, in Morelos state, Mexico, May 31, 2017. Picture taken May 31, 2017.Edgard GarridoWhile the limits on refined sugar from Mexico at 30 percent were significantly below the previous 53 percent limit, these groups had initially pushed for a 15 percent limit. Sources on both sides of the border had said on Monday that the U.S. sugar industry had added new demands outside of the terms agreed on earlier yesterday by the two governments.  The American Sugar Alliance said it objected to the new deal because Mexico would still be able to ship in refined sugar to meet additional U.S. demand above quota. The alliance wants the U.S. Department of Agriculture to have the final say on the type of sugar to be imported. Long-Standing Feud, Nafta Looms Slideshow (2 Images)The agreement, if finalized, was expected to avert potential retaliation from Mexico on imports of U.S. high-fructose corn syrup which had worried corn growers and refiners. The potential for an escalation in the dispute would have soured the relations between the two countries ahead of NAFTA renegotiations. Agriculture is typically one of the most sensitive areas in trade negotiations. Representatives of some of the world's biggest grain traders, Archer Daniels Midland Co and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] joined Cocal-Cola Co and others to lobby against the U.S. sugar producers in the dispute.  Avoiding a trade war will benefit everyone, and I'm glad that this years-long trade dispute is finally reaching its end,  said Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, adding that Ross balanced all interests in the negotiations. U.S. refiners wanted even more stringent terms on imports from Mexico. They have complained that high-quality Mexican raw sugar was going straight to sugar consumers, rather than passing through U.S. refineries. Mexican producers would have been happy with a rollover of existing terms. The deal would mark the culmination of a multi-year dispute between the countries over sugar, after U.S. groups in 2014  asked the government for protection from subsidized exports  from Mexico.     In 2014, the U.S. government slapped large duties on Mexican sugar but hammered out a deal with Mexico that suspended those levies. Factions of the U.S. industry have said that the deal failed to eliminate harm to U.S. producers from Mexican imports. ASR Group and fellow cane refiner Imperial Sugar, owned by commodities firm Louis Dreyfus Company BV [AKIRAU.UL], have said they are being starved of raw supplies under the current deal. They have asked the U.S. government to terminate the pact. The latest talks began in March, two months after U.S. President Donald Trump took office vowing a tougher line on trade to protect U.S. industry and jobs.

It was unclear if Ross would impose the settlement if U.S. producers did not sign onto it. Related CoverageU.S. sugar producers concerned about 'loophole' in U.S.-Mexican pactThe agreement lifts the minimum prices for Mexican imports, which will likely be passed on by U.S. sugar refiners to food companies and beverage and confectionary producers and ultimately to consumers. A trade group that represents a coalition of U.S. sugar buyers and other firms that are critics of the U.S. program said the deal favored the interests of U.S. sugar producers, and estimated the cost to the consumers in higher prices for food, drinks and confectionary at around $1 billion.  Today's announcement is a bad deal for hardworking Americans, and exemplifies the worst form of crony capitalism,  the U.S. Coalition for Sugar Reform said in a statement. The negotiations were an attempt to settle an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy case brought by a coalition of cane and beet farming groups and ASR Group, the maker of Domino Sugar that is owned by the politically well-connected Fanjul family of Florida. Workers spray fertilizer in a sugar cane field in Zacatepec de Hidalgo, in Morelos state, Mexico, May 31, 2017. Picture taken May 31, 2017.Edgard GarridoWhile the limits on refined sugar from Mexico at 30 percent were significantly below the previous 53 percent limit, these groups had initially pushed for a 15 percent limit. Sources on both sides of the border had said on Monday that the U.S. sugar industry had added new demands outside of the terms agreed on earlier yesterday by the two governments.  The American Sugar Alliance said it objected to the new deal because Mexico would still be able to ship in refined sugar to meet additional U.S. demand above quota. The alliance wants the U.S. Department of Agriculture to have the final say on the type of sugar to be imported. Long-Standing Feud, Nafta Looms Slideshow (2 Images)The agreement, if finalized, was expected to avert potential retaliation from Mexico on imports of U.S. high-fructose corn syrup which had worried corn growers and refiners. The potential for an escalation in the dispute would have soured the relations between the two countries ahead of NAFTA renegotiations. Agriculture is typically one of the most sensitive areas in trade negotiations. Representatives of some of the world's biggest grain traders, Archer Daniels Midland Co and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] joined Cocal-Cola Co and others to lobby against the U.S. sugar producers in the dispute.  Avoiding a trade war will benefit everyone, and I'm glad that this years-long trade dispute is finally reaching its end,  said Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, adding that Ross balanced all interests in the negotiations. U.S. refiners wanted even more stringent terms on imports from Mexico. They have complained that high-quality Mexican raw sugar was going straight to sugar consumers, rather than passing through U.S. refineries. Mexican producers would have been happy with a rollover of existing terms. The deal would mark the culmination of a multi-year dispute between the countries over sugar, after U.S. groups in 2014  asked the government for protection from subsidized exports  from Mexico.     In 2014, the U.S. government slapped large duties on Mexican sugar but hammered out a deal with Mexico that suspended those levies. Factions of the U.S. industry have said that the deal failed to eliminate harm to U.S. producers from Mexican imports. ASR Group and fellow cane refiner Imperial Sugar, owned by commodities firm Louis Dreyfus Company BV [AKIRAU.UL], have said they are being starved of raw supplies under the current deal. They have asked the U.S. government to terminate the pact. The latest talks began in March, two months after U.S. President Donald Trump took office vowing a tougher line on trade to protect U.S. industry and jobs.

While the Conservatives are widely expected to win the vote, their opinion poll lead has narrowed significantly since May called the election and some surveys predict she could fail to win a majority. UKIP, which played a key role in Britain's vote to leave the European Union last year, got nearly 13 percent of the vote in the last election in 2015 but now languishes at about 4 percent in the polls.  The Tories (Conservatives) alone are committed to seeing Brexit through in full,  the Sun wrote in a full-page editorial in its Wednesday edition, adding that UKIP no longer served any purpose.  The Tories need every former UKIPper's vote to win a decent majority to make Brexit happen without opposition parties or rebellious MPs (members of parliament) holding it back.  The Sun, along with the broadsheet The Times, is owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch and has a circulation of more than 1.6 million and is estimated to have a readership of more than double that. After Conservative leader John Major's unexpected 1992 election victory, the newspaper carried the headline  It's the Sun wot won it , though its readership has fallen sharply since then. The Sun article featured a cartoon of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson pointing at the reader alongside the words  Your country needs you kippers to vote Tory , in a play on a famous British wartime recruitment poster  Your country needs you .  The newspaper said it did not believe Brexit would happen under Labour, and warned that electing a government led by left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would be  the gravest mistake this country has ever made .  The Tories have not run a great campaign but they are pro-business, pro-jobs and pro-low taxes. Most polls predict they will win, do not assume it,  it said.  Make certain you vote tomorrow. Even if you haven't done so before, vote Conservative.  Britain's second highest selling newspaper, the Daily Mail, dedicated its first 10 pages to attacking Corbyn.  Its front page described Corbyn and two of his senior colleagues as  apologists for terror  who had  devoted their lives to befriending the enemies of Britain while undermining the very institutions that keep us safe in our beds . The Daily Express newspaper, which supported UKIP at the 2015 election, also urged its readers to vote Conservative with  Vote May or we face disaster  splashed across its front-page. The left-leaning Guardian newspaper has backed Labour ahead of the election, while the Economist last week dropped its support for May in favor of the pro-EU Liberal Democrats.

Temer's opponents see a court ruling as a way out of a political crisis set off by corruption allegations leveled against the center-right leader, but a decision could take weeks if not months and can be appealed by Temer. The case was postponed in April to allow for new evidence arising from Brazil's biggest ever corruption scandal involving billions of dollars in kickbacks paid by companies to scores of politicians and government officials. The court's decision is key to deciding the political future of Brazil, where the prospect of having a second president ousted in one year has generated political volatility. The uncertainty has weakened the Brazilian currency, stocks and bonds in recent days. Temer was the running mate of leftist President Dilma Rousseff and replaced her when she was impeached last year. If Temer is removed from office, lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia would take over and Congress would have 30 days to pick a caretaker to lead the country until elections in late 2018. Left-wing parties are calling for early general elections for Brazilians to pick a new president directly. Gustavo Guedes (R), lawyer of Brazilian President Michel Temer speaks with Flavio Caetano, lawyer of former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, before a session by Brazil's electoral court takes up 2014 case that could unseat President Michel Temer, in Brasilia, Brazil, June 6, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoIf Temer is found guilty, he is expected to appeal, which could delay the process for months. The government would likely destabilize and prompt members of his coalition to withdraw their support, increasing chances he could be forced to resign. The main ally in Temer's governing coalition, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), is waiting for the court ruling to decide whether to abandon Temer's government, which would sink his fiscal reform agenda.  The electoral court had been expected to blame Rousseff and absolve Temer, but that is now unlikely due to recent plea-bargain testimony by executives of giant meatpacker JBS SA (JBSS3.SA) and engineering group Odebrecht who alleged they gave illegal funds to his campaign. Slideshow (6 Images)Temer has refused to resign since the Supreme Court late last month authorized an investigation against him for alleged corruption, racketeering and obstruction of justice. The investigation is based in part on a secret recording of a conversation with a JBS executive in which Temer appeared to agree to the payment of hush money to silence a key witness in a massive graft scandal. The political crisis engulfing Temer's government deepened on Saturday with the arrest of a close aide, former lawmaker Rocha Loures, who was seen in a police video receiving a bag filled with 500,000 reais ($152,000) in cash. The Supreme Court has given Temer until Friday to answers questions by federal police on his conversation with the JBS executive and whether Loures was a middleman. Temer's political standing took another blow on Tuesday with the arrest of his former minister of tourism, Henrique Eduardo Alves, for suspected graft in the building of a soccer stadium in northeastern Brazil for the 2014 World Cup.

UKIP, which played a key role in Britain's vote to leave the European Union last year, got nearly 13 percent of the vote in the last election in 2015 but now languishes at about 4 percent in the polls.  The Tories (Conservatives) alone are committed to seeing Brexit through in full,  the Sun wrote in a full-page editorial in its Wednesday edition, adding that UKIP no longer served any purpose.  The Tories need every former UKIPper's vote to win a decent majority to make Brexit happen without opposition parties or rebellious MPs (members of parliament) holding it back.  The Sun, along with the broadsheet The Times, is owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch and has a circulation of more than 1.6 million and is estimated to have a readership of more than double that. After Conservative leader John Major's unexpected 1992 election victory, the newspaper carried the headline  It's the Sun wot won it , though its readership has fallen sharply since then. The Sun article featured a cartoon of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson pointing at the reader alongside the words  Your country needs you kippers to vote Tory , in a play on a famous British wartime recruitment poster  Your country needs you . The newspaper said it did not believe Brexit would happen under Labour, and warned that electing a government led by left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would be  the gravest mistake this country has ever made .  The Tories have not run a great campaign but they are pro-business, pro-jobs and pro-low taxes. Most polls predict they will win, do not assume it,  it said.  Make certain you vote tomorrow. Even if you haven't done so before, vote Conservative.  Britain's second highest selling newspaper, the Daily Mail, dedicated its first 10 pages to attacking Corbyn. Its front page described Corbyn and two of his senior colleagues as  apologists for terror  who had  devoted their lives to befriending the enemies of Britain while undermining the very institutions that keep us safe in our beds . The Daily Express newspaper, which supported UKIP at the 2015 election, also urged its readers to vote Conservative with  Vote May or we face disaster  splashed across its front-page. The left-leaning Guardian newspaper has backed Labour ahead of the election, while the Economist last week dropped its support for May in favour of the pro-EU Liberal Democrats.

The Warriors have won an NBA-record 14 consecutive games to start the playoffs and will take a 2-0 advantage over the Cleveland Cavaliers into the pivotal Game Three on the road at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday.  Their dominance as they chase a second title in three years has led some to wonder how they stack up against Magic Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers of the 1980s and Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls of the 1990s.   The game is completely different than it was back then,  Green told reporters on Tuesday.      Nowadays, if you can't shoot a three, you're a liability on the floor. That wasn't the case back then.   The Warriors have assembled some of the best three-point shooters the league has ever seen, helping them win their postseason games this year by an average of nearly 17 points per contest.  Asked about Johnson's comment that his  Showtime  Lakers team would have swept this year's Warriors, Green merely laughed.   That's my thoughts,  he said after a chuckle.  Green said former players wanting to compare their teams to the Warriors did so out of a feeling of insecurity over their own accomplishments.   If you have self confidence, you don't really care about what who is coming after you is doing,  he added.  If you have full fulfillment in what you did, then it's not really, 'we would have done this and we would have done that'. If they're great, they're great. Respect what they're doing.   The Warriors have been so great during playoffs that the contest has been widely panned for not being competitive enough. The reigning champion Cavaliers dropped just a single game on their way through the eastern conference playoffs prior to the NBA Finals.  Despite the criticism, the Finals so far have earned the highest TV ratings since 1998, when Jordan's Bulls won their sixth NBA championship of the decade by defeating the Utah Jazz in six games.   They were great in their time, we're great in our time and respect that,  Green said.

The Court of Appeals' 5-0 reversal of a lower court ruling handed the city a major victory in its two-decades-long effort to stop the proliferation of  adult  establishments.  It is evident as a matter of law that the city met its burden of showing that the adult establishments continued to have a predominant focus on sexually explicit materials and activities,  making the law  facially constitutional,  Judge Eugene Fahey wrote. Erica Dubno, a lawyer representing various adult business owners, and Edward Rudofsky, a lawyer representing the Pussycat Lounge and Ten's Cabaret, said they were disappointed with the decision and would review their clients' options. Nick Paolucci, a spokesman for the city's law department, said the decision shows the city  acted reasonably and lawfully to stem the widespread circumvention of zoning regulations intended to protect our quality of life.  The 2001 law sought to plug a gap created six years earlier, when the City Council banned dancing clubs and erotic stores from residential and most commercial areas, and from within 500 feet of similar businesses, schools and places of worship. Those restrictions were adopted as part of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's focus on quality of life issues, including crime. Following a court challenge, the city in 1998 created the  60/40  test, deeming businesses  adult  if at least 40 percent of their area or stock involved sexual content. But it soon found many businesses in  sham  compliance, often by stuffing PG-rated videos in back rooms while focusing on X-rated wares. In 2001, the city decided that businesses offering specific services, such as topless dancing or peep booths, would qualify automatically as  adult.  That would have required many businesses to close or move. A Manhattan judge found the law unconstitutional in August 2012, and was upheld by a divided state appeals court in July 2015. But Fahey said the appeals court's  rigidly mechanical  approach defeated the city's substantial interest in curbing sex shops, and ignored how  quintessentially sexual activity  such as lap dances could qualify businesses as  adult.  Ed Anakar, director of operations for a unit of Rick's Cabaret parent RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc (RICK.O), with three Manhattan locations unaffected by the outcome, said the decision  can make it difficult for 60/40 locations to continue operations.  The case is For the People Theatres of N.Y. Inc et al v. City of New York, New York State Court of Appeals, No. 59.

Dollar Express was formed in 2015 when Sycamore Partners II LP bought some 330 stores in 35 states from Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. The two companies were required to sell the stores in order to win antitrust approval for a merger. In a complaint filed in Delaware's Chancery Court, Dollar Tree accused Sycamore of siphoning tens of millions of dollars from Dollar Express, failing to pay for at least $50 million in goods and services provided to Dollar Express during a transition period and failing to rebrand Family Dollar stores as Dollar Express. Dollar Express has filed a lawsuit against Dollar Tree, saying that the larger chain drove Dollar Express out of business by opening new shops near the new chain and putting underqualified and inattentive store managers in divested stores, among other actions. With Dollar Express' failure, the stores are being purchased by Dollar General Corp, with the transfer expected this month.

You just need to decide what color you want and what size wheels, at least for the initial production,  Musk told shareholders at an annual meeting in Silicon Valley. Hundreds of thousands of potential buyers put down refundable deposits on the Model 3. Buyers will be able to configure vehicles next month, Musk said. More choice will become available, but he did not say when. By comparison, the Model S sedan has choices of battery size, an optional sunroof, various interiors and several upgrades including sound systems and limited self-driving. Speculation has been rampant over what specifications owners would be able to choose for the upcoming Model 3, which will be priced at about $35,000.  Musk said the Model 3 will first be offered only with two-wheel drive. All-wheel drive likely will come early next year. Musk spoke as investors fell in line with management, backing the board's view on five proposals, including rejecting a bid to make directors stand for re-election each year. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds had urged fellow Tesla shareholders to vote for a proposal aimed at the declassification of the company's board, arguing that  annual accountability can lead to increased company performance.  (bit.ly/2rUhocK) Musk said Tesla planned to add two and maybe three new directors next month or the following month. They would come from  a broad range of backgrounds and industries,  Musk said.

Hundreds of thousands of potential buyers put down refundable deposits on the Model 3. Buyers will be able to configure vehicles next month, Musk said. More choice will become available, but he did not say when. By comparison, the Model S sedan has choices of battery size, an optional sunroof, various interiors and several upgrades including sound systems and limited self-driving. Speculation has been rampant over what specifications owners would be able to choose for the upcoming Model 3, which will be priced at about $35,000.  Musk said the Model 3 will first be offered only with two-wheel drive. All-wheel drive likely will come early next year. Musk spoke as investors fell in line with management, backing the board's view on five proposals, including rejecting a bid to make directors stand for re-election each year.

The state has a multibillion dollar deficit that must be sorted before July 1, the start of Alaska' new fiscal year, in order to avoid shuttering government offices and services. Last week, Alaska warned thousands of state workers about potential layoffs unless legislators can agree on a fix to the fiscal crisis. The legislature has been convening through a special session, but Walker described the negotiations as in  a stalemate.  On Monday, Walker proposed a compromise package that would reduce the state's deficit from at least $3.7 billion last year to a $300 million shortfall.  I'm not wild about the compromise,  said Walker, an independent, during a news conference on Tuesday.  But we're running out of time.  Since 2013, Alaska has struggled with substantial consecutive budget deficits, in part caused by the state's large reliance on oil revenues and the continued low prices of oil. The state has balanced its budget over the last few years by drawing $10 billion from its savings without adding new revenues. The state's budget has been slashed from $7.8 billion in 2013 to $4.3 billion proposed for 2018.  I know some people say, 'We need to do some cuts.' We've been doing that,  Walker said on Tuesday.  We have done that significantly.  Almost 2,300 state positions were eliminated in recent years, along with 70 state programs, and over 40 state facilities, such as prisons, youth detention, and motor vehicle sites, have been closed, Walker said.

The 10-episode  Planet of the Apps,  an unscripted show with similarities to ABC's  Shark Tank,  is part of an effort to add exclusive video programing to Apple's music streaming service to help attract new subscribers. The first episode will be available for streaming around the globe starting at 9 p.m. PDT on Tuesday (midnight EDT/0400 GMT).    Hollywood has been awaiting the entry of deep-pocketed Apple into original TV series, a field crowded with award-winning dramas and comedies from outlets such as Netflix and Time Warner Inc's HBO.    The first  Apps  episode will be free to anyone who wants to see it on iTunes and the show's website. Subsequent episodes will be released each Tuesday on Apple Music and available only to the streaming service's subscribers.     On the show, developers try to interest celebrity mentors with a 60-second pitch on an escalator. The advisers help contestants build their products and prepare appeals for funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners, the first investor in Snapchat.      The question when you have ideas is how to take those to fruition,  Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said in an interview.  Sometimes you may not know how, you might be afraid of what's involved. This really shows how that's possible.

Will.i.am appears as a judge alongside entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk and actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba, who have started businesses.     I felt like this was a great way to show that app developers or business people are not just white dudes in suits, or white dudes coding,  Alba said.    In the first two episodes, developers present apps for online shopping, campus safety and a school backpack. One team tries to adapt after Google announces a feature similar to its own concept. Another developer feels overwhelmed by will.i.am's rapid-fire list of ideas.     At the show's end, viewers are told they can download the apps from Apple's App Store. The show itself will be promoted on the Apple.com home page, on iTunes and elsewhere.     All of our customers are going to be exposed to this in one way or another,  Cue said.

Macron said during the presidential campaign that he planned to fast-track the pro-business legislation through use of executive decrees in a country where the high cost of hiring and firing is seen as a deterrent to investors, and where unemployment is near double-digits. Unions had urged the government to take more time to discuss reforms they fear would reduce cherished employment rights and make France more like Anglo-American style labor markets where workers enjoy less protection. But speaking after meeting unions, Macron's prime minister stuck to a plan to pass the reforms during the summer holiday lull, a period in which unions could struggle to mobilize protesters, and said he would not seek to please unions on all of their demands.  We won't agree on everything, but we must move forward,  Edouard Philippe, a former conservative mayor told a news conference.  It's both indispensable and urgent.  Macron's La Republique En Marche (LREM) party is on course to win a landslide majority in this month's legislative elections, opinion polls show. That should help the 39-year old president sweep aside resistance from left-wing lawmakers and could also limit public support for any trade union strike action aimed at derailing the measures. Strikes and a rebellion in parliament were two factors that hamstrung the previous government's attempts to introduce similar reforms.

His progress reforming France's regulation-laden economy this time around will be closely watched by Germany, which wants its European Union partners to boost growth and jobs by implementing measures like the ones it introduced more than a decade ago.  In a document released on Tuesday, the government broadly stuck to measures contained in Macron's campaign manifesto including the capping of compensation awards in unfair dismissal cases.

I don't think the unions will want to make a snap judgment since we only just got this letter from the government,  Laurent Berger of the moderate CFDT union said on French TV. Although the more militant CGT union unsurprisingly said it disagreed with the reforms and called on workers to protest over the coming days and weeks, the smaller FO union said the reform plan contained both positive and negative points.     It could be that unions will let past some major parts of the labor code reform, which would be good initially,  Agnes Verdier-Molinie of the IFRAP free-market think-tank said.  But they may be going for a deal on the pension reform, which the government could easily backtrack on because nobody understands what was in this reform,  she said on Boursorama TV. Macron plans to tackle pension reform next year and has said he wanted to merge all 37 pension systems into one, including the generous ones enjoyed by workers at the state-owned EDF utility or SNCF railway company.

Sixty percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied with Macron. And, after the first round eliminates any candidate who gathers less than 12.5 percent of the vote, Macron's candidates will be strongly placed across the country to win the decisive second round, pollsters say. In the second round, the poll projected that The Republicans party would win just 105-125 seats in parliament, the Socialists 25-35 seats, France Unbowed 12-22 seats and the National Front 5-15 seats. The poll, conducted on June 2-4 for France Televisions and radiofrance with a sample of 2,103 people, also found that 68 percent of those surveyed had definitely made up their minds about whom they would vote for. That rose to 75 percent for those backing Macron's party.

Ronald Murdock, 51, of Toledo, appeared on Tuesday in a Lucas County criminal court where a judge set his bail at $1.5 million, prosecutor Clinton Wasserman said. Murdock has not entered a plea. Wasserman said his arraignment was postponed to June 13 to allow time to obtain an attorney. Murdock was indicted last week on charges of murder and felonious assault, both counts stemming from his sexual relationship with the woman, according to local media. The indictment marks the latest in a series of criminal cases brought against HIV-positive individuals prosecuted in the United States for sexual behavior and other conduct that would expose another person to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Ohio, like several other U.S. states, has a law requiring people with HIV to disclose that fact to their sexual partners. The Center for HIV Law & Policy in New York has tallied nearly 280 arrests and prosecutions related to concerns about HIV exposure in the United States between 2008 and 2016, but has said that list is not exhaustive. The center and other advocates for people with HIV oppose laws such as the one used in Ohio to prosecute Murdock, saying they stigmatize people with the disease. But Josh Klempner, the son of the woman who died, voiced support for the prosecution in an interview with a Toledo television station WTVG.  It would be different if he had let people know that he had it (HIV) before he got in that relationship, but he didn't,  Klempner told the station.  So that right there tells me and everybody else that he has no care.  Klempner's mother, Kimberly Klempner, died in February at age 51, according to WTVG. The station aired images of her death certificate listing AIDS as the cause. Murdock was married to another woman during his affair with Klempner, the television station reported, citing a police report. A police spokesman could not be reached for comment. Josh Klempner told the station his mother discovered Murdock had HIV when she looked at his medication bottles. Murdock, who could not be reached for comment, faces a sentence of up to life in prison if convicted of murder.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/ohio-crime-aids-idUSL1N1J327G"},

Five of the overdoses - but none of the deaths - were among people living in the same household in Bibb County, which includes the city of Macon, Gaylord Lopez, director of the nonprofit Georgia Poison Center, said by phone on Tuesday evening. The victims ranged in age from 20s to early 60s, he said. The Georgia Department of Public Health said Tuesday that emergency responders in the central and southern parts of the state treated dozens of people over a 48-hour period. Some patients were unconscious or had stopped breathing and many had to be placed on ventilators.  Patients reportedly purchased yellow pills alleged to be Percocet, an opioid pain medication,  the health department said in a statement. Percocet is a brand-name drug that contains the opioid painkiller oxycodone and the analgesic pain reliever acetaminophen.  There are presumptively now four deaths connected to this but this has not been confirmed with lab testing,  said Nelly Miles, spokeswoman for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Lopez said the likely ingredients to the fake prescription pills included heroin and the more powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl, based on the effects of the pills. State officials said they would await lab tests before talking about the likely ingredients. The health department said tests were being conducted to confirm the link between the counterfeit pills and the overdoses. The highest concentration of overdoses occurred in or near Macon, Warner Robins, Centerville, Perry and Albany, the health department said.  We're afraid that this may be more widespread,  Lopez said. The abuse of opioids - a class of drugs that includes heroin and prescription painkillers - has assumed epidemic proportions in the United States. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that in 2015, about 33,000, or 91 Americans a day, died from opioid overdosed. In Europe, drug overdose deaths rose 6 percent to 8,441 in 2015, rising for the third straight year, driven by the increasing use of opioids like fentanyl, Europe's Lisbon-based drug monitoring agency said on Tuesday.

The appearance of the B-52, a long-range bomber that first went into service in the 1950s, irked Moscow. A Russian Foreign Ministry official said the plane's appearance in Europe would not help ease tensions between the West and Russia. A former Russian Air Force commander called the move  disrespectful.  Russian air defense systems detected the U.S. bomber at around 1000 Moscow time as it was flying over neutral waters parallel to the Russian border and sent a Sukhoi Su-27 jet to intercept it, the Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement.    The Russian SU-27 crew, having approached at a safe distance, identified the aircraft as an American B-52 strategic bomber and escorted it  until such time as it changed course and flew away from the border area, the ministry said. Russia said the SU-27 took off from its Baltic Fleet air defense unit, which is based in the European exclave of Kaliningrad. The U.S. military said its aircraft was in international airspace and declined immediate comment on the Russian plane's actions.  We can confirm that the U.S. Air Force B-52 was operating in international airspace but we don’t have any information to provide at this time regarding the behavior of Russian aircraft,  Air Force spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said. NATO members such as Britain regularly report scrambling jets to intercept Russian nuclear-capable bombers flying close to their air space. It is less common for Russia to report using its fighters for the same reason.  In a separate incident, Russia said an MiG-31 jet fighter had intercepted a Norwegian patrol plane over the Barents Sea. Russia's Defence Ministry identified the plane as a P-3 Orion anti-submarine aircraft. The Russian Defence Ministry complained that the Norwegian plane had flown close to Russia's state border with its transponders switched off. The Norwegian military confirmed the encounter, but said it was  normal.  Moscow was more put out by the B-52's appearance. The state-backed Sputnik news agency cited a Foreign Ministry official, Mikhail Ulyanov, as saying Moscow believed a  number of U.S. B-52s had recently been transferred from their base in Louisiana to Britain to take part in military exercises.  The fact that NATO forces are converging near Russia's borders and carrying out military exercises supported by strategic bombers from the USA capable of carrying nuclear weapons hardly helps de-escalate tensions in Europe,  Sputnik quoted Ulyanov as saying. U.S. forces are engaged in various exercises with Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and other partner nations as part of the Saber Strike war games. The United States is also taking part in the annual BALTOPS naval training exercise in the Baltic Sea which runs until June 16.  Pyotr Deinekin, a former Russian Air Force commander, was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying that he could not recall the last time a B-52 had flown over the Baltic Sea and that the incident raised troubling questions.  Such behavior does not deserve respect,  said Deinekin, who said Russia needed to establish what weaponry the B-52 was carrying. The B-52 was designed to attack Moscow's most vital targets via the North Pole in the event of a nuclear war when the Soviet Union still existed, Deinekin said.   Strategic bombers should not fly so close to our land borders,  he said.

Data from Statistics South Africa showed the first quarter contraction was led by weak manufacturing and trade, suggesting high unemployment and stagnant wages were dragging down South Africa's long-resilient consumer sector, analysts said. Political instability, high unemployment and credit ratings downgrades have dented business and consumer confidence in South Africa and the rand ZAR=D3 extended its losses against the dollar, while government bonds also weakened ZAR186=. South Africa's economy contracted by 0.7 percent in the first three months of 2017 after shrinking by 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, lagging market expectations of a quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion of 0.9 percent. It was the first time two consecutive quarters showed contraction - the definition of recession - since the second quarter of 2009, although there have been individual quarters of negative growth in more recent years. A consumer frenzy helped the South African economy grow by an average 5 percent a year in the five years before the 2009 recession, but it has struggled to register much growth since.  The slowdown in Q1 was due to much worse results from usually stable consumer-facing sectors that had been the key drivers of growth in recent years,  Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said. The worst performing sector was trade, catering and accommodation, which contracted by 5.9 percent, while manufacturing - one of the key sectors - fell by 3.7 percent. Standard Chartered Bank's Chief Africa Economist Razia Khan said the  awful  data showed weakness where it was not expected.  Economy in Tatters  FILE PHOTO: A man walks past South African petro-chemical company Sasol's synthetic fuel plant in Secunda, north of Johannesburg, in this picture taken March 1,2016.Siphiwe Sibeko/File PhotoThe poor growth numbers piles more pressure on the ruling African National Congress (ANC) to get the economy back on track faster as it tries to stave off further credit ratings downgrades and stem falling voter support. The Treasury said the negative economic growth was a risk to fiscal targets and introduced  significant downward bias  to this year's growth estimate of 1.3 percent, up from 0.3 percent in 2016.  The current state of the economy puts more pressure on us as government, business, labor and broader society to intensify our growth program and improve confidence as a matter of urgency to arrest the decline and set the economy on a higher growth trajectory,  the Treasury said in a statement. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba would meet business leaders soon to discuss ways to achieve inclusive economic growth, the Treasury said. Slideshow (2 Images)Pressure on President Jacob Zuma, including from within the ANC, has risen since a controversial cabinet reshuffle in March that led to downgrades to  junk  status by S&P; Global Ratings and Fitch and allegations of influence peddling. Zuma has denied any wrongdoing over the allegations. Corruption allegations escalated when local media reported this week on more than 100,000 leaked emails they say show inappropriate interference in lucrative tenders.  Our economy is now in tatters as a direct result of an ANC government which is corrupt to the core and has no plan for our economy,  Mmusi Maimane, the leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance, said. S&P; Global Ratings and Fitch last week said risks to South Africa's ratings include weak economic growth and political uncertainty ahead of the ANC conference in December when a successor to Zuma as party leader will be chosen. Zuma can remain as head of state until an election in 2019. Moody's, whose Baa2 rating is two notches above  junk , is reviewing South Africa for a possible downgrade.

The Pentagon, which has sought to stay out of Syria's civil war to instead focus its firepower on Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq, carried out a similar strike on May 18 that was denounced by Damascus. A Syrian military source said the strike had caused deaths and material damage and showed the coalition was  in support of terrorism . The Syrian military command warned against the dangers of escalation, the source added.  In recent days, the U.S. military has repeatedly warned massing forces to stay away from a so-called  de-confliction  zone near a garrison used by American special forces and U.S.-backed fighters around the southern town of At Tanf. The zone was agreed with Russia, Syrian President Bashar al Assad's ally. Assad is also backed by Iran and Shi'ite militias.  Despite previous warnings, pro-regime forces entered the agreed-upon de-confliction zone with a tank, artillery, anti-aircraft weapons, armed technical vehicles and more than 60 soldiers,  the U.S.-led coalition said in a statement. It said the United States, via a military hotline with Russia, issued several warnings before the strike, which destroyed two artillery pieces, an anti-aircraft weapon and damaged the tank. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the strike was carried out by manned, U.S. aircraft.  The Coalition does not seek to fight Syrian regime or pro-regime forces but remains ready to defend themselves if pro-regime forces refuse to vacate the de-confliction zone,  the statement said. Still, the incident showed that the area around the Tanf garrison in southern Syria was under growing pressure. Baghdad-Damascus Highway Tanf is part of a region known as the Badia, which consists of vast, sparsely populated desert territory that stretches all the way to the Jordanian and Iraqi borders and was declared a military priority by Syria's foreign minister earlier in May. U.S.-backed rebel advances against Islamic State militants have allowed them to secure swaths of territory in the Badia, alarming the Syrian government and its allies. U.S.-backed rebels took Tanf from Islamic State last year, and regional intelligence sources say they mean to use it as a launchpad to capture Bukamal, a town on Syria's border with Iraq and an important jihadist supply route. The coalition's presence in Tanf, on the Damascus-Baghdad highway, was also meant to stop Iran-backed groups from opening an overland route between Iraq and Syria, the sources say. In interviews with Syrian state-owned TV station al-Ikhbariya broadcast on Saturday, Syrian soldiers vowed they would reopen the Baghdad-Damascus highway.  Within a few days, you will find us at the Iraqi border, and we will achieve a great and historic victory in the history of this crisis - cleansing the entire Badia, liberating the Tanf road ... and restoring the vital artery between Iraq and Syria,  said one of the soldiers interviewed by the state TV channel in the Badia area. Western-backed rebels resumed on Tuesday a heavy barrage of rocket attacks on Iranian-backed militia outposts along the Baghdad-Damscus Baghdad highway. The United States sought to keep all sides focused on battling Islamic State, or ISIS.  The Coalition calls on all parties in southern Syria to focus their efforts on the defeat of ISIS, which is our common enemy and the greatest threat to regional and worldwide peace and security,  the statement said.

The 13-year-old incident is the only one that is recent enough to support criminal charges. Cosby, 79, best known for playing a revered father figure in the 1980s television hit family comedy series  The Cosby Show,  has denied all the allegations. The outcome of his trial in the Philadelphia suburb of Norristown, Pennsylvania, largely hinges on whether jurors believe Constand's testimony, which came on the trial's second day. Defense lawyers began grilling Constand on the stand late on Tuesday about several discrepancies in her initial account to police in 2005. Their questioning will continue on Wednesday. Constand said she first met Cosby in late 2002, when she was the newly hired director of basketball operations for Temple University's women's basketball program and he was a university trustee and the Philadelphia school's most famous alumnus. Actor and comedian Bill Cosby walks to the courtroom during a break on the second day of his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S. June 6, 2017.Matt Rourke/PoolAfter a series of phone calls, Constand, who was then in her 30s, said the married Cosby began inviting her to dinner at his house and other events.  He was a Temple friend, somebody I trusted, a mentor and somewhat of an older figure to me,  Constand testified. Slideshow (7 Images)On at least one occasion, Constand said she rebuffed his advances, telling him she had no interest. In January 2004, Constand said, Cosby invited her to his house again to discuss her career options. That night, he offered her the three blue pills, saying they were her  friends.  When she asked if they were herbal, he nodded, she told jurors. Constand said she told Cosby she trusted him and swallowed the pills. After the incident, Constand acknowledged under questioning from both sides that she maintained contact with Cosby but said she felt obligated to do so because of her job. The defense has suggested that her repeated calls to him show the encounter was consensual.

Wilson,Bill Gurley,Bozoma Saint John,Eric Holder,Frances Frei,Heather Somerville,Jason Hanold,Susan Fowler,Tammy Albarran,Travis Kalanick,UBER,STAFF/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc said on Tuesday it fired 20 employees and was improving management training following an investigation by a law firm into sexual harassment allegations and other claims at the ride-hailing company. Uber fired the staff following a report by law firm Perkins Coie, which Uber hired to look into claims of harassment, discrimination, bullying and other employee concerns. The law firm has been working in parallel with a broader investigation by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder into company culture and practices. Perkins Coie investigated 215 staff complaints going back as far as 2012, Uber said, taking action in 58 cases and no action on 100 more. Other investigations are continuing. Of the 215 claims, Uber said 54 were related to discrimination, 47 related to sexual harassment, 45 to unprofessional behavior, 33 to bullying and 36 to other types of claims. It said the majority of the claims came from employees based at Uber's San Francisco headquarters. The world's highest-valued venture-backed company - worth $68 billion at its last funding round - also told staff on Tuesday it would expand its employee relations unit to better investigate claims and that it would dramatically increase management training since most Uber managers were first-time bosses, a person familiar with the matter said. On Monday, Uber said it hired Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei to train all managers, reporting to Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick. On Tuesday, it said Bozoma Saint John, prominent in some Apple Inc product launches, joined the company as chief brand officer. Uber also said it is offering a confidential helpline for employees to report concerns and has implemented a system to log and track all complaints. Year of Questions Uber's firing of employees comes after a series of events this year that have raised questions about Uber's business model and leadership. In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler said in a widely read blog post that managers and human resources officers had not punished her manager after she reported his unwanted sexual advances. In addition, Uber was caught using technology to avoid regulator crackdowns, a video surfaced showing Kalanick berating an Uber driver, and the company is caught up in legal battles around the world over the way its ride-services business operates. Uber is also facing a lawsuit from Alphabet Inc's self-driving car division, Waymo, alleging trade secret theft. The company declined to comment further on the move to fire staff. Some saw it as a step in the right direction for Uber to repair its tarnished reputation.  They are heading the right way, both with action and reaction,  said Jason Hanold, manager partner at human resources executive recruitment firm Hanold Associates. He added it was  not nearly a complete and final surgery to heal a troubled culture.  The move follows a string of executive departures at Uber, including the company president, heads of finance and product, an East Coast general manager and several high-level engineers. For the last three months, Uber has been seeking a chief operating officer to work alongside Kalanick, who has earned a reputation as a pugnacious leader. Uber board member Bill Gurley is overseeing the search. Uber has also been under the microscope of Holder and Tammy Albarran, partners at the law firm Covington & Burling, who were asked to conduct a broad review of sexual harassment at Uber as well as general questions about diversity and inclusion. Their report was completed at the end of May and has been shared with a subcommittee of the Uber board of directors, a company representative said. In March, Uber board member Arianna Huffington pledged to make the findings of Holder's investigation available to the public. Initially, the company had expected to make a public announcement this week, but that timing has been pushed back. Uber is expected to discuss it with staff next week, a person familiar with the matter said.

DeVos, a Republican who narrowly won Senate approval for her post in February after strident opposition from Democrats and a few fellow party members, testified before the Senate appropriations subcommittee on education about the proposed budget Trump submitted to Congress last month. Trump's plan to cut $9 billion from the Education Department's budget would  improve educational opportunities  and shift the federal role in education, DeVos told the panel.  I understand those figures are alarming for many,  she said.  However, this budget refocuses the department on supporting states and school districts in their efforts to provide high-quality education to all our students.  Democrats took turns asking DeVos about the bigger budget line-items and talking about students who they say could be hurt by large spending cuts. The most pointed exchanges were on whether private schools that receive federal funds would have to agree not to discriminate against students. DeVos would only repeat that schools taking federal money must abide by U.S. law. But Senator Jeff Merkley and his fellow Democrats said she was refusing to answer the question because federal law is unclear in many areas of possible discrimination, such as the rights of transgendered people. U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testifies before the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

The subcommittee's chair, conservative Republican Roy Blunt, said he believed Congress would not approve the budget as proposed. U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testifies before the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. June 6, 2017.Aaron P. Bernstein Such a significant cut to the department’s budget is likely untenable,  Blunt said, pressing specifically to preserve funds for technical programs, work-study financial aid and the Special Olympics. Civil rights groups and Democrats say the budget would send public dollars to private companies, disband after-school care, hurt schools in poor neighborhoods, shrink the ranks of teachers, and make it harder for many to afford college.  DeVos is currently working on major transformations in student loans. The budget suggests changing income-based repayment plans and ending loan forgiveness for workers in the public sector, which DeVos said would clear up confusion around the loans. With the stated aim of giving parents more choices for their children's education, DeVos and Republicans support charter schools, which are publicly funded but operate independently, frequently by corporations, as well as subsidies to help pay private-school tuition. Many Republicans on the panel applauded the budget's proposal to boost such  school choice  programs. But the subcommittee's senior Democrat, Patty Murray, said the cuts  highlight the ways that the policies and priorities you and President Trump are pushing would hurt students, hurt communities, and represent a clear broken promise to workers and the middle class.

In the days following Grande's sold-out show on Sunday, which raised some $3 million for a victims fund and became the UK's most-watched TV broadcast of the year, Britons have embraced the 23-year-old singer. They have called for her to be formally honored by Queen Elizabeth and the city of Manchester. At the One Love Manchester concert, Grande hugged a weeping schoolgirl as they performed her hit  My Everything  before a crowd of 55,000 people.  The tiny performer ended the show alone on stage, singing  Somewhere Over the Rainbow  in tears.  Her team is working to release that emotional final number as a single to raise even more money for victims, the UK's Independent newspaper reported on Tuesday. The concert served as a catharsis for many in Manchester and all of Britain, moving British tabloid journalist Piers Morgan to write Grande a lengthy public apology for doubting her courage.

Danny Lawson/One Love Manchester/Handout via REUTERS By coming back to Manchester so soon, shrugging off the  latest attack in London, standing on that stage and performing with such raw emotion and power, you showed more guts, resilience, strength of character and ‘Blitz spirit’ than every sniveling, pathetic ISIS coward put together,  Morgan wrote in the Daily Mail. Grande was herself a survivor of the May 22 bombing, still inside Manchester Arena when an explosion ripped through the lobby area following her encore. Morgan had criticized the apparently shaken singer for quickly returning home to Florida instead of staying to console victims. But within days Grande and her team began organizing the benefit, which overcame considerable logistical and security obstacles to take place less than two weeks later. Days before the show, she turned up unannounced at a Manchester-area hospital to visit young girls wounded in the attack. Grande carried on with Sunday's show despite the attack in London the night before in which seven people were killed. She enlisted fellow entertainers such as Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Coldplay and Oasis frontman and Manchester native Liam Gallagher. Daily Telegraph columnist Victoria Lambert similarly apologized for dismissing Grande, who first gained fame on the Nickelodeon teen comedy  Victorious,  as a lightweight pop star not fit to be a role model for her daughter.  Because far from being a cliched child star, Grande has shown herself to be a perfect role model for our daughters after all,  Lambert wrote.

Ronald Murdock, 51, of Toledo, appeared on Tuesday in a Lucas County criminal court where a judge set his bail at $1.5 million, prosecutor Clinton Wasserman said. Murdock has not entered a plea. Wasserman said his arraignment was postponed to June 13 to allow time to obtain an attorney. Murdock was indicted last week on charges of murder and felonious assault, both counts stemming from his sexual relationship with the woman, according to local media.  The indictment marks the latest in a series of criminal cases brought against HIV-positive individuals prosecuted in the United States for sexual behavior and other conduct that would expose another person to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Ohio, like several other U.S. states, has a law requiring people with HIV to disclose that fact to their sexual partners. The Center for HIV Law & Policy in New York has tallied nearly 280 arrests and prosecutions related to concerns about HIV exposure in the United States between 2008 and 2016, but has said that list is not exhaustive. The center and other advocates for people with HIV oppose laws such as the one used in Ohio to prosecute Murdock, saying they stigmatize people with the disease.   But Josh Klempner, the son of the woman who died, voiced support for the prosecution in an interview with a Toledo television station WTVG.  It would be different if he had let people know that he had it (HIV) before he got in that relationship, but he didn't,  Klempner told the station.  So that right there tells me and everybody else that he has no care.  Klempner's mother, Kimberly Klempner, died in February at age 51, according to WTVG. The station aired images of her death certificate listing AIDS as the cause. Murdock was married to another woman during his affair with Klempner, the television station reported, citing a police report.  A police spokesman could not be reached for comment. Josh Klempner told the station his mother discovered Murdock had HIV when she looked at his medication bottles. Murdock, who could not be reached for comment, faces a sentence of up to life in prison if convicted of murder.

In the final months that President Barack Obama, a Democrat, was in office the department finalized a regulation easing the way for students from struggling for-profit colleges such as Corinthian and ITT Tech to quickly receive debt relief that they were entitled to by law.  In a letter sent on Monday to U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the state attorneys general said they were concerned about growing backlogs of applications for the relief and of loans approved for discharge that simply need a sign-off. The letter, signed by the top lawyers of Illinois, California, Massachusetts and other states, was released on Tuesday. They said they were particularly troubled that some borrowers had been notified their loans were eligible for fast discharge under the regulation but that the cancellation has not yet happened. According to the letter, the Department stated in January it had notified 23,000 borrowers that their loan forgiveness should be complete within the 60 to 120 days, but in many cases loans have not been canceled.  That means some of Corinthian's students could still be on the hook for monthly payments or possibly face debt collection. Work on discharging loans that have been approved is underway, according to Education Department Press Secretary Liz Hill.  We are working with servicers to get these loans discharged as expeditiously as possible,  Hill said in a statement.  Some borrowers should expect to obtain discharges within the next few weeks.  Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said about 5,000 past Corinthian students in the state received letters last December directing to apply on-line for relief. Since then, his office has received queries about delays in the process.     Delay in canceling this debt, especially for students who have already been approved, could put even greater financial strain on students in Virginia and around the country,  he said in a statement. Amid federal and state investigations in 2015 into its post-graduation rates, for-profit Corinthian filed for bankruptcy and abruptly closed its 28 schools.

Britain's general election as it maps its exit from the European Union, the European Central Bank's policy meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before a Senate panel could all affect investor sentiment. Comey was investigating whether Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia colluded to sway the 2016 U.S. election when he was fired by Trump in May. His testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for the U.S. President's agenda of rolling back regulations and overhauling the tax code. British Prime Minister Theresa May could increase her parliamentary majority, an opinion poll showed on Tuesday, shortly after another survey suggested the race with the opposition Labour Party was neck-and-neck. Investors will also watch out for the European Central Bank's meeting, where policymakers are expected to take a more benign view of the economy, according to sources. “We have a lot of stuff on Thursday. If you’re looking for days where we can see some long-awaited volatility, I'd say that's probably going to be Thursday and Friday,  said Anthony Conroy, president at brokerage Abel Noser in New York.

Trump wrote on Twitter that his recent trip to the Middle East was  already paying off  and cast an anti-Islamist speech he made in Saudi Arabia as the inspiration for a decision by Arab powers to sever ties with Qatar in protest at what they say is the Gulf nation's support for terrorism.  So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!  Trump wrote on Twitter. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations. Trump later spoke by phone with Saudi King Salman and stressed the need for Gulf unity, a senior White House official said.  His (Trump's) message was that we need unity in the region to fight extremist ideology and terrorist financing. It's important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region,  the senior official told Reuters. U.S. officials were blindsided by Saudi Arabia's decision to sever diplomatic ties with Qatar in a coordinated move with Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), current and former officials in Washington told Reuters. [nL1N1J212U] The United States was not informed of the decision until just before it was announced, the State Department said. Even as Trump applauded the Arab countries' move, the Pentagon on Tuesday renewed praise of Qatar for hosting U.S. forces and its  enduring commitment to regional security.  [nL1N1J3148] Some 8,000 U.S. military personnel are stationed at al Udeid in Qatar, the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East and a staging ground for U.S.-led strikes on the Islamic State militant group that has seized parts of Syria and Iraq. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis spoke on Tuesday by phone with his Qatari counterpart, a Pentagon spokesman said, without disclosing the details of their discussion. [nL1N1J31XF] Trump's tweet appeared at odds with comments from U.S. officials who had said on Monday that the United States would quietly try to calm the waters between Saudi Arabia and Qatar because Qatar is too important to U.S. military and diplomatic interests to be isolated. Qatar has for years parlayed its enormous gas wealth and media strength into broad influence in the region. But Gulf Arab neighbours and Egypt have long been irked by its maverick stances and support for the Muslim Brotherhood, which they regard as a political enemy. Related CoverageHow Al Jazeera covered Arabs severing ties with its backerMorocco airline cancels flights via Doha to Arab states over Qatar disputePentagon says Mattis speaks to Qatar's defense ministerSaudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Tuesday that Qatar needed to take several steps, including ending its support of Palestinian militant group Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, to restore ties with other key Arab states, which also cut transport links. [nL8N1J3581]  We've decided to take steps to make clear that enough is enough,  Adel Al-Jubeir told journalists in Paris. He said the  fairly large cost  on Qatar's economy would convince it to change its policies.  The campaign to isolate Qatar disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food, and deepened fears of a possible shock to the global natural gas market, where it is a major player. [nL3N1J33A3] Qataris crowded into supermarkets to stock up on goods, fearing shortages. Maersk, the world's biggest container shipping line, said it was unable to transport goods in or out of Qatar because it could not take them through the UAE port of Jebel Ali. Jordan joined the pressure on Qatar, downgrading its diplomatic representation and revoking the license of Doha-based TV channel Al Jazeera.

The U.S. still wants to see this issue de-escalated and resolved immediately, in keeping with the principles that the president laid out in terms of defeating terror financing and extremism.   Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber al-Sabah flew to Saudi Arabia for talks with King Salman bin Abdulaziz, Saudi and Kuwaiti state media reported, but gave no details on the discussions.  Russian President Vladimir Putin told Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, in a phone call that crisis situations should be solved by political and diplomatic means,  in dialogue , the Kremlin said. The rift has affected global oil prices, hit travel plans and sown confusion among businesses. Slideshow (9 Images)Saudi Arabia's central bank advised banks in the kingdom not to trade with Qatari banks in Qatari riyals, banking sources said. [nL8N1J30TV] Oil prices fell on concern that the rift would undermine efforts by OPEC to tighten output. [nL3N1J313I] Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV that Qatar would not retaliate, hoping Kuwait would help resolve the dispute.  We are willing to sit and talk,  he told CNN later, and said his country was  protecting the world from potential terrorists . A Qatari official said the rift was pushing Doha in the direction of leaving the six-state Gulf Cooperation Council,  with deep regret . The split among the Sunni Muslim states erupted last month after the summit of Muslim leaders in Saudi Arabia, where Trump denounced Shi'ite Muslim Iran's  destabilising interventions  in Arab lands, where Tehran is locked in a tussle with Riyadh for influence. Bans on Doha's fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas. [nL8N1J23EL] [nL1N1J20M6] Traders on global markets worried that Riyadh's allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond. Saudi Arabia's aviation authority revoked the license of Qatar Airways and ordered its offices to be closed within 48 hours. Qatar's stock market slid to its lowest close since January 2016 and the Qatari riyal came under pressure. [nL8N1J32DJ] Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said isolating Qatar, including the use of sanctions, would not resolve any problems.

In the final months that President Barack Obama, a Democrat, was in office the department finalized a regulation easing the way for students from struggling for-profit colleges such as Corinthian and ITT Tech to quickly receive debt relief that they were entitled to by law. In a letter sent on Monday to U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the state attorneys general said they were concerned about growing backlogs of applications for the relief and of loans approved for discharge that simply need a sign-off. The letter, signed by the top lawyers of Illinois, California, Massachusetts and other states, was released on Tuesday. They said they were particularly troubled that some borrowers had been notified their loans were eligible for fast discharge under the regulation but that the cancellation has not yet happened. According to the letter, the Department stated in January it had notified 23,000 borrowers that their loan forgiveness should be complete within the 60 to 120 days, but in many cases loans have not been canceled. That means some of Corinthian's students could still be on the hook for monthly payments or possibly face debt collection. Work on discharging loans that have been approved is underway, according to Education Department Press Secretary Liz Hill.  We are working with servicers to get these loans discharged as expeditiously as possible,  Hill said in a statement.  Some borrowers should expect to obtain discharges within the next few weeks.  Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said about 5,000 past Corinthian students in the state received letters last December directing to apply on-line for relief. Since then, his office has received queries about delays in the process.  Delay in canceling this debt, especially for students who have already been approved, could put even greater financial strain on students in Virginia and around the country,  he said in a statement. Amid federal and state investigations in 2015 into its post-graduation rates, for-profit Corinthian filed for bankruptcy and abruptly closed its 28 schools.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-education-corinthian-idUSL1N1J324S"},

Uber fired the staff following a report by law firm Perkins Coie, which Uber hired to look into claims of harassment, discrimination, bullying and other employee concerns. The law firm has been working in parallel with a broader investigation by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder into company culture and practices. Perkins Coie investigated 215 staff complaints going back as far as 2012, Uber said, taking action in 58 cases and no action on 100 more. Other investigations are continuing. Of the 215 claims, Uber said 54 were related to discrimination, 47 related to sexual harassment, 45 to unprofessional behavior, 33 to bullying and 36 to other types of claims. It said the majority of the claims came from employees based at Uber's San Francisco headquarters. The world's highest-valued venture-backed company - worth $68 billion at its last funding round - also told staff on Tuesday it would expand its employee relations unit to better investigate claims and that it would dramatically increase management training since most Uber managers were first-time bosses, a person familiar with the matter said. On Monday, Uber said it hired Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei to train all managers, reporting to Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick. On Tuesday, it said Bozoma Saint John, prominent in some Apple Inc (AAPL.O) product launches, joined the company as chief brand officer. Uber also said it is offering a confidential helpline for employees to report concerns and has implemented a system to log and track all complaints. Year of Questions  Uber's firing of employees comes after a series of events this year that have raised questions about Uber's business model and leadership.  In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler said in a widely read blog post that managers and human resources officers had not punished her manager after she reported his unwanted sexual advances. In addition, Uber was caught using technology to avoid regulator crackdowns, a video surfaced showing Kalanick berating an Uber driver, and the company is caught up in legal battles around the world over the way its ride-services business operates.  Uber is also facing a lawsuit from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) self-driving car division, Waymo, alleging trade secret theft. The company declined to comment further on the move to fire staff. Some saw it as a step in the right direction for Uber to repair its tarnished reputation.  They are heading the right way, both with action and reaction,  said Jason Hanold, manager partner at human resources executive recruitment firm Hanold Associates. He added it was  not nearly a complete and final surgery to heal a troubled culture.  The move follows a string of executive departures at Uber, including the company president, heads of finance and product, an East Coast general manager and several high-level engineers. For the last three months, Uber has been seeking a chief operating officer to work alongside Kalanick, who has earned a reputation as a pugnacious leader. Uber board member Bill Gurley is overseeing the search. Uber has also been under the microscope of Holder and Tammy Albarran, partners at the law firm Covington & Burling, who were asked to conduct a broad review of sexual harassment at Uber as well as general questions about diversity and inclusion. Their report was completed at the end of May and has been shared with a subcommittee of the Uber board of directors, a company representative said.  In March, Uber board member Arianna Huffington pledged to make the findings of Holder's investigation available to the public. Initially, the company had expected to make a public announcement this week, but that timing has been pushed back. Uber is expected to discuss it with staff next week, a person familiar with the matter said.

In a White House meeting, Trump welcomed indications by senior Republicans that the Senate might vote on a healthcare bill in July, before it breaks for the summer, after the House of Representatives passed its own version in May.  Now the Senate I'm sure will follow suit and get a bill across the finish line this summer that will be great healthcare and I'm looking forward to seeing it,  Trump said. The gathering included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and his No. 2, Senator John Cornyn, along with House Speaker Paul Ryan and his deputies, Representatives Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise. Buffeted by criticism on many fronts, Trump wants faster action from his fellow Republicans who control Congress, pressing lawmakers to finish the job of dismantling the Obamacare healthcare law and move on quickly to another of his priorities: tax cuts. McConnell said Senate Republicans are  getting close  to a healthcare plan after he presented an outline at a lunchtime meeting but he declined to say when he might bring it up for a vote. Other senior Republicans say they hope to vote by early July.  The leader would like to do this soon,  Senator Orrin Hatch told reporters. The Senate requires a 60-vote supermajority to advance most legislation but Republican Mike Enzi, head of the Senate Budget Committee, said the health bill that passed the House qualifies for an expedited process that would require only 51 votes. Still, Republicans have little margin for error because they only control 52 seats in the 100-seat chamber and remain divided over key questions such as how quickly to scale back the Medicaid health plan for the poor.  You have to get 50 people - that means they have to get me and a lot of people who are concerned about Medicaid,  said Senator Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia, a state that depends heavily on the program. Medicaid was expanded under Obamacare but the House bill would phase that expansion out in 2020. The Senate bill might keep the expansion in place beyond that date, said Republican Senator John Barrasso. Comey Testimony U.S. President Donald Trump walks out to annouce proposed reforms to the U.S. air traffic control system during an event at the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. June 5, 2017.Jonathan ErnstWhatever the White House's efforts to push ahead with policy plans, there will be a spotlight on testimony by James Comey, the FBI director fired by Trump last month, to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Senators will question Comey on whether Trump tried to get him to back off an FBI investigation into ties between the president's 2016 campaign and Russia, an attempt that critics have said could constitute obstruction of justice. Trump denies any collusion with Russia and has called the investigation a  witch hunt.  The Justice Department has appointed a special counsel to oversee its probe into the Russia issue and several congressional panels also are investigating the matter.   Elected on pledges to overhaul the healthcare system and slash taxes, Trump has yet to achieve a major legislative win, and time is running out before lawmakers leave Washington for the August break. There has been little progress on healthcare since the House passed its bill. McConnell told Reuters late last month he did not yet know how to amass the votes needed to pass a bill on  healthcare. He appeared to make some progress on Tuesday. Some Republican lawmakers praised an outline that McConnell presented at a lunchtime meeting, although they cautioned that much work remained to be done.  Senator Bill Cassidy said the plan offered more protections than the House bill for people who already have pre-existing illnesses when they apply for insurance coverage - a major point of contention.  I think personally they are moving in the right direction,  he said. The House healthcare bill could result in 23 million people losing insurance, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bill also would reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026, according to the analysis.  Congress might then turn its focus to overhauling the tax code in September. While the administration would prefer that such changes not add to the national debt, Marc Short, Trump's top aide on Capitol Hill, told reporters on Monday that the top priority would be cutting taxes. The Trump administration has outlined a broad plan that would cut tax rates for businesses and streamline the tax system for individuals. The proposal has been short on details, including how much the tax cuts would cost and what loopholes would be closed. Others are eager to move past healthcare as well.  We need to bring this to an end and move to taxes,  said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.

Ronald Murdock, 51, of Toledo, appeared on Tuesday in a Lucas County criminal court where a judge set his bail at $1.5 million, prosecutor Clinton Wasserman said. Murdock has not entered a plea. Wasserman said his arraignment was postponed to June 13 to allow time to obtain an attorney. Murdock was indicted last week on charges of murder and felonious assault, both counts stemming from his sexual relationship with the woman, according to local media.  The indictment marks the latest in a series of criminal cases brought against HIV-positive individuals prosecuted in the United States for sexual behavior and other conduct that would expose another person to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Ohio, like several other U.S. states, has a law requiring people with HIV to disclose that fact to their sexual partners. The Center for HIV Law & Policy in New York has tallied nearly 280 arrests and prosecutions related to concerns about HIV exposure in the United States between 2008 and 2016, but has said that list is not exhaustive. The center and other advocates for people with HIV oppose laws such as the one used in Ohio to prosecute Murdock, saying they stigmatize people with the disease.   But Josh Klempner, the son of the woman who died, voiced support for the prosecution in an interview with a Toledo television station WTVG.  It would be different if he had let people know that he had it (HIV) before he got in that relationship, but he didn't,  Klempner told the station.  So that right there tells me and everybody else that he has no care.  Klempner's mother, Kimberly Klempner, died in February at age 51, according to WTVG. The station aired images of her death certificate listing AIDS as the cause. Murdock was married to another woman during his affair with Klempner, the television station reported, citing a police report.  A police spokesman could not be reached for comment. Josh Klempner told the station his mother discovered Murdock had HIV when she looked at his medication bottles. Murdock, who could not be reached for comment, faces a sentence of up to life in prison if convicted of murder.

Two videos distributed over social networks appear to show police and troops taking protesters' possessions during rallies on Monday, spurring outrage among many Venezuelans who already complain of excessive use of force during the two months of protests. Opposition legislators on Tuesday filed a complaint with the state prosecutors' office against the police and the National Guard in relation to the alleged robberies. Reuters could not independently verify the content of the videos. The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   (Interior Minister) Nestor Reverol gives them license to steal,  said legislator Juan Matheus, adding that the complaint includes accusations of cruel and inhumane treatment. One video shows four police officers surrounding a woman who is reeling from the effects of tear gas, with one of the officers pulling what appears to be a watch from her wrist.  In another, troops take a protester's helmet and handbag before boarding motorcycles. The government says it is fighting opposition  terrorist cells  trying to overthrow Maduro.  Venezuelan National Guard members take position while clashing with demonstrators rallying against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela June 6, 2017.Marco BelloThey say the effort is similar to a 2002 coup that briefly ousted late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, noting that protesters routinely disrupt traffic and damage public property while mounting barricades of burning debris.    Legislators said during Tuesday's congressional session that they had registered 16 attacks against journalists on Monday alone, with some 300 during the two months of protest. Ruling Socialist Party legislators did not attend the congressional session.     Francisco Zambrano, a journalist with website Runrun.es which is critical of the government, said in a telephone interview that troops had blocked his way when he attempted to run from a cloud of tear gas fired to disperse demonstrators.  I identified myself as a journalist, but they still opened my bag, threw my things to the ground and searched my pockets,  said Zambrano.  I thought it was a regular procedure until they took out my cell phone and one of them kept it.  Information Minister Ernesto Villegas, asked on Monday about an incident involving troops throwing a television camera off a highway, said the National Guard as an institution was being unfairly held responsible for actions by individuals.  I know and have worked with men and women of the National Guard, who are honorable and are out there risking their lives. They have also been the victim of aggression,  he said during a televised interview. The protests have left some 65 people dead and thousands injured.  The government is preparing an election at the end of July for a constituent assembly that will have the power to rewrite the constitution and potential dissolve state institutions.  Maduro's critics call it a power grab meant to keep him power indefinitely.

In the final months that President Barack Obama, a Democrat, was in office the department finalized a regulation easing the way for students from struggling for-profit colleges such as Corinthian and ITT Tech to quickly receive debt relief that they were entitled to by law.  In a letter sent on Monday to U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the state attorneys general said they were concerned about growing backlogs of applications for the relief and of loans approved for discharge that simply need a sign-off. The letter, signed by the top lawyers of Illinois, California, Massachusetts and other states, was released on Tuesday. They said they were particularly troubled that some borrowers had been notified their loans were eligible for fast discharge under the regulation but that the cancellation has not yet happened. According to the letter, the Department stated in January it had notified 23,000 borrowers that their loan forgiveness should be complete within the 60 to 120 days, but in many cases loans have not been canceled.  That means some of Corinthian's students could still be on the hook for monthly payments or possibly face debt collection. Work on discharging loans that have been approved is underway, according to Education Department Press Secretary Liz Hill.  We are working with servicers to get these loans discharged as expeditiously as possible,  Hill said in a statement.  Some borrowers should expect to obtain discharges within the next few weeks.  Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said about 5,000 past Corinthian students in the state received letters last December directing to apply on-line for relief. Since then, his office has received queries about delays in the process.     Delay in canceling this debt, especially for students who have already been approved, could put even greater financial strain on students in Virginia and around the country,  he said in a statement. Amid federal and state investigations in 2015 into its post-graduation rates, for-profit Corinthian filed for bankruptcy and abruptly closed its 28 schools.

The kinds of policies they're talking about would lower the price of fruit and vegetables, help lower-income families make better choices, impose taxes on sugary drinks and launch media campaigns, according to a report in the journal PLoS Medicine.    I think what our study does is highlight the potential power of food policies to reduce cardiovascular mortality and disparities in the U.S.,  said lead author Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard, of Imperial College London. Pearson-Stuttard and colleagues say large disparities exist along social and economic lines when it comes to diet and heart disease. While past research found policies could influence diets, the measurable effects on heart disease in the U.S. are unknown.  The key question we’re trying to answer overall is which policies are best buys for policymakers to consider,  said co-senior author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University in Boston. Using a computer model, the researchers estimated what various policies might mean for heart disease in the U.S. between 2015 and 2030. Those national policies included a media campaign and a 10 percent tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. The researchers also analyzed the effect of subsidizing the cost of fruits and vegetables, by 10 percent in general and by 30 percent for people on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. A national 10 percent subsidy on fruits and vegetables would be the most beneficial policy, with approximately 150,500 lives saved from deaths by heart disease over the 15-year study period, the authors estimate.  A 30 percent subsidy for SNAP participants would likely save 35,100 lives, and a 10 percent soda tax would save 31,000 lives, they calculate. A year-long mass media campaign was estimated to save 25,800 lives. Mozaffarian said it's interesting that a national soda tax would save only about a fifth of the lives saved by a national 10 percent subsidy of fruits and vegetables.  That’s not something that would be obvious without doing the analysis,  he said. The estimates also suggested that a targeted subsidy for SNAP participants, which has been tested in Massachusetts, would narrow the gap in heart disease rates between low-income and higher-income people by 8 percent. Pearson-Stuttard told Reuters Health the large gains among SNAP participants can be attributed to their higher risks for heart disease and stroke, and their lower consumption of fruits and vegetables. When the researchers estimated the potential benefit of implementing all of the policies together, they found that nearly 230,000 lives could be saved over 15 years while reducing the heart disease disparity between SNAP-eligible and -ineligible people by 6 percent. The researchers can't say how much such policies would cost, but Pearson-Stuttard said they may be cost-neutral since revenue would increase for certain foods while decreasing for others.  It’s very likely these (expenses) over time would be cost-saving because of the savings in the healthcare system and contributions to the wider economy,  he said.

Yet for all the fuss that greeted babies Ella and Alexander Clooney, they may end up the warm-up act to this summer's blockbuster.  Beyonce also is expected to give birth to twins any day now, turning motherhood into the biggest celebrity story of the year despite the striking contrast in styles of the two women who have become the focus of a baby-obsessed public.  Music superstar Beyonce, 35, has delighted in displaying her belly in Instagram photos and stage performances, whereas Amal Clooney, 39, made it clear during her pregnancy that she would like fans to focus more on her work than her baby bump.  It is a marked change from Beyonce's first pregnancy, with now 5-year-old Blue Ivy, when the singer was so rarely photographed that it spawned unfounded conspiracy theories that the  Single Ladies  star had faked her condition. This time, Beyonce announced she was expecting twins a year after her  Lemonade  album chronicled her response to widespread reports of infidelity by husband Jay Z.  What better sign to show to the world that you and your husband are a unit than to say, 'Hey I'm pregnant. We're back on track again.' And twins is even better,  said Berkeley Kaite, professor of English at McGill University in Montreal. Clooney, however, a top-flight humanitarian lawyer based in London, shunned the limelight that comes from being the spouse of the dashing  Ocean's Eleven  actor, who in the past had declared he did not want kids.  Clooney having children is exciting to many people because he's perceived as a guy who took a while to settle down, and with an amazing woman who is very interesting,  said JD Heyman, deputy editor of People magazine. Demi Moore Uncovers a Trend  FILE PHOTO - Beyonce performs at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, California, U.S. on February 12, 2017.Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoAside from the usual fascination with the private lives of public figures, the attention given to the double sets of twins  reflects conflicting attitudes to modern motherhood. Celebrity pregnancies became big business after actress Demi Moore's nude, seven-month pregnant photo shoot for Vanity Fair in 1991. The photo of Moore proudly caressing her belly was included in Time magazine's 2016  100 Photographs: The Most Influential Images of All Time,  where it was hailed as showing that maternity could be both empowering and sexy and for changing what had been a relatively private affair into a public event.   FILE PHOTO - Beyonce performs at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, California, U.S. on February 12, 2017.Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoMore than 25 years on, motherhood remains a double-edged sword with assumptions about what women should or should not do, said Ann C. Hall, co-editor of the 2009 book  Mommy Angst.   Women have a lot of baggage... Everyone is happy, but on the other hand there is a whole host of expectations, and a lot of judgment,  said Hall, who is also chair of comparative humanities at the University of Louisville, Kentucky.  Some of us want to figure out what they are going to do with these babies. How are they going to negotiate their careers and their maternity? There aren't really any hard and fast rules for negotiating that any more, which is great and liberating but also anxiety producing,  Hall said. Beyonce and Clooney also highlight the trend towards older mothers, which comes with worries over infertility and the growth of the estimated $3 billion to $4 billion U.S. fertility market as women delay having children. According to the 2017 National Vital Statistics report, birth rates for women ages 30 to 44 in the U.S. were the highest in 2015 since the early 1960s. Childless celebrities undergo equal scrutiny, as highlighted by Jennifer Aniston in a 2016 open letter objecting to the endless media speculation over whether she is, is not, or will ever be pregnant.  We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child ... we don't need to be married, or mothers to compete. We get to determine our own 'happily ever after' for ourselves,  Aniston wrote.

The settlement, disclosed by Tutor Perini in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, resolves a lawsuit the Los Angeles-based company filed against the bank in 2011 in federal court in Boston. The deal came after a federal appeals court in November revived the lawsuit, holding that a lower court judge erred in dismissing federal and Massachusetts state securities fraud claims against the second-largest U.S. bank. A jury trial in the lawsuit had been scheduled for June 19 but on May 23 the parties informed the court that they had reached a settlement. Terms were not disclosed at that time. Under the agreement, neither side made any admission of liability or wrongdoing, Tutor Perini said. A spokesman for Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the lawsuit, Tutor Perini alleged that Bank of America pushed it to buy auction-rate securities in late 2007 and early 2008 despite knowing the market was  one step away from illiquidity.  The $330 billion auction-rate market seized up in February 2008 when dealers stopped supporting it, saddling investors with illiquid debt that had often been marketed as a cash substitute. Bank of America was among more than one dozen companies that agreed to repurchase more than $61 billion of auction-rate securities to settle claims by Andrew Cuomo, then New York's attorney general and now its governor. Tutor Perini said corporate investors such as itself were ineligible for these settlements. The case is Tutor Perini Corp v.

Now that the aircraft is in service, the risk profile goes down and the pricing of the aircraft starts to move up,  Cromer said on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association's annual meeting in Mexico. The U.S. International Trade Commission is expected to make a preliminary ruling by June 12 on Boeing's complaint that Bombardier dumped the CSeries below cost in the U.S. market while benefiting from unfair Canadian subsidies. Cromer said Bombardier's sales and funding practices were legal and the dispute had not hurt ongoing sales efforts, which were helped by the entry into service of the CS100 last July and the CS300 last December.  He declined to say if he expected to announce any orders at the Paris Air Show this month, but said the purpose of the event was mainly to showcase new products.  I don't like to predict. I think we're going to build the momentum at the Paris Air Show,  Cromer said. Boeing Co's logo is seen above the front doors of its largest jetliner factory in Everett, Washington, U.S. January 13, 2017.Alwyn ScottBombardier has not reported a new CSeries order in nearly a year, leading some analysts to question whether the aggressive response from Boeing's complaint could slow further sales and effectively close its new rival out of the narrowbody market. Cromer argued the opposite was true.  It has actually raised the interest level,  he said.  This attention is really creating a situation where airlines around the world are saying this airplane is real. It's in service and it's performing well and something to be contended with.  Cromer also said Bombardier was on track to ramp up CSeries production later this year after postponing deliveries at the end of 2016 due to problems at engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N).  We feel very confident that Pratt is going to be there to support that delivery schedule,  he said.   The calendar for 2017 was always a little bit backend-loaded, so ... we expect deliveries, per our plan, to start accelerating in the back half of the year.

Several U.S. airlines and industry groups said they back the global aviation agreement approved by 70 countries, including the United States, to curb greenhouse gases from international flights. Trump said on Thursday the United States would withdraw from the landmark 2015 Paris pact to fight climate change, raising questions about whether he would also seek to back out of the 2021 voluntary phase of the airlines agreement. Air Transport Action Group told reporters at an industry gathering in Cancun, Mexico, on Tuesday that the deal was less costly for carriers than navigating around multiple regional or national rules. Airlines for America, the trade group for major U.S. carriers, said in response to queries from Reuters that it remained committed to the agreement brokered by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). At the Mexico event this week, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and carriers like American Airlines (AAL.O) and United Airlines (UAL.N) reiterated their support for the deal. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said in an email that the aviation agreement was under review, as were all regulatory policies agreed by the Obama administration. There is no deadline for action, she said. Under the global deal, airlines will buy carbon credits from environmental projects around the world to offset growth in emissions from international commercial flights. The deal, known as the Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, has a voluntary phase starting in 2021 and that would become mandatory. Without the pact, airlines would be charged for emissions by regions like Europe.  We believe having a series of national or regional measures overlapping and contradicting each other increases costs, administration, complexity,  said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group.  Having a single global approach brings significant financial and operational benefits,  he told reporters in Cancun. Citing ICAO figures, he said the industry estimates the deal will cost airlines to $1.5 billion to $6.2 billion in 2025, depending on future carbon prices, and no more than 1.8 percent of industry revenues by 2035.  According to ICAO, airlines from 70 States, which account for almost 88 percent of international flights, will be covered by the deal. Russia and India have said they would not participate in the voluntary phase from 2021 to 2026.

Freeland spoke after recent NATO and G7 summits where U.S. President Donald Trump upset leaders to such an extent that German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed doubts about the reliability of the United States. Freeland, noting  international relationships that had seemed immutable for 70 years are being called into question,  stressed the value of bilateral ties with the United States, traditionally seen as Canada's closest friend. She also made clear those bonds might loosen.  The fact that our friend and ally has come to question the very worth of its mantle of global leadership, puts into sharper focus the need for the rest of us to set our own clear and sovereign course,  she said in an address to Parliament.  For Canada that course must be the renewal, indeed the strengthening, of the postwar multilateral order.   Trump, elected on a promise to put  America first,  accused North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies of not picking up their fair share of military spending and then announced he was quitting the Paris climate change pact.

She said NATO and Article 5, the alliance's mutual defense doctrine, lay at the heart of national security policy. Trump upset NATO leaders by not personally affirming his commitment to the article. For Canada to play a larger role globally, it would need to make  a substantial investment  in its armed forces, she added. Officials are due to unveil additional military spending on Wednesday.  Canadian diplomacy and development sometimes require the backing of hard power,  she said. Canada spends less than one percent of what the United States devotes to defense. Freeland said Canada was deeply disappointed by the decision to leave the Paris pact but made no other criticisms of U.S. policy. Canada will soon start talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.

The chairman of the influential House Energy and Commerce Committee said he planned to unveil a package of legislation to overhaul federal rules governing self-driving vehicles.  We're getting very close. I think it's a good package. We've put a lot of work into it,  Representative Greg Walden of Oregon said in an interview, adding that there was  good bipartisan agreeement  and he hoped to unveil and take up the package in the next month or two. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, is also working on a legislative self-driving proposal with Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat.  We're not there yet but we are getting closer,  Thune said.  Thune and Walden spoke to Reuters on Tuesday after getting a ride in a self-driving Audi, a unit of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE). Companies such as Alphabet Inc and Ford Motor Co are aggressively pursuing automated technologies and want unified federal regulations to replace outdated rules and make it simpler to develop and eventually sell the technology across the country. This spring, Republican staff drafted a summary of 16 potential legislative proposals on federal reforms and regulations that they circulated to automakers and which was seen by Reuters.  Among proposals under consideration is one to allow the U.S. Transportation Department to exempt up to 100,000 autonomous vehicles from current safety standards, which were written on the assumption responsibility for a car's operation rested with the human driver. FILE PHOTO: A fleet of Uber's Ford Fusion self driving cars are shown during a demonstration of self-driving automotive technology in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S. on September 13, 2016.Aaron Josefczyk/File PhotoThe existing motor vehicle safety standards bar the sale of vehicles without steering wheels and gas pedals, for example. Alphabet Inc's Waymo unit has called for those rules  be changed. Another proposal would prohibit a state from restricting testing by a manufacturer of up to 250 vehicles and comes as automakers have sparred with California over revisions to its self-driving car testing rules.  Thune said he planned to hold a hearing on June 14 about self-driving car issues but did not put a specific timetable on introducing legislation. He said he wanted to avoid a  patchwork  of regulations from 50 different states on self-driving cars and look at cybersecurity and other issues.  The key thing is to make sure we stay in the lead on the innovation that there aren't unnecessary roadblocks in the way, balancing that with safety,  Walden said. On Monday, the U.S. Transportation Department said it would unveil revised self-driving guidelines within the next few months, responding to automakers' calls for regulations to sanction costly efforts to put autonomous vehicles on the road. The voluntary guidelines would provide direction to states on self-driving cars as Congress works to set more permanent rules to oversee autonomous vehicles. But legislation might not be approved this year and states and automakers are eager for guidance from regulators in the interim. Vehicle crashes annually kill more than 35,000 people on U.S. roads and injure 2.4 million. Walden said the goal was to get self-driving cars on the roads in big numbers so in a generation people would say:  'What a bunch of barbarians - they drove themselves? Are you kidding me? And look at how many died every year and they thought that was acceptable?'

Clement asked the court to invalidate Amgen's patents because they improperly claim a broad monopoly on an entire category of antibodies, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, that lower  bad  cholesterol levels. Amgen's lawyer, Daryl Joseffer, argued the injunction was the only fair outcome in the dispute after a jury upheld the validity of Amgen's patents. He also said Amgen's patents reflect true innovations that resulted from a $2 billion investment in research and development. Zachary Silbersher, a patent lawyer at Kroub, Silbersher & Kolmykov who is not involved in the case, said the three judges' questions frequently put Jossefer on the defensive and suggest that they may be  leaning a little toward Regeneron.  Silbersher noted that much of the argument focused on whether the trial judge unfairly handicapped Regeneron and Sanofi by blocking them from presenting certain evidence during the jury trial. That line of questioning suggests the Federal Circuit could order a do-over trial in the case, he said. Umer Raffat, an analyst at the investment banking advisory firm Evercore ISI, agreed the case is  leaning more toward Regeneron  but added that it was  impossible to call with high conviction.  PCSK9 inhibitors like Repatha and Praluent have been shown to dramatically lower  bad  LDL cholesterol and are expected to generate billions in sales. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved both drugs in 2015. Amgen sued Paris-based Sanofi and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron in 2014. A federal jury in Delaware upheld the validity of Amgen's patents in March 2016, prompting U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson to hand down an injunction blocking Praluent sales for 12 years. The sales ban was stayed pending Regeneron and Sanofi's appeal.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/amgen-regeneron-patent-idUSL1N1J320I"},

Trump,Elizabeth Warren,JEFF MERKLEY,Scott Pruitt,Sheldon Whitehouse,TAMMY DUCKWORTH,USA,BIOFUELS/ICAHN,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Five Democratic senators asked the Environmental Protection Agency in a letter on Tuesday to hand over documents relating to the role of Carl Icahn, a refining company owner, in shaping biofuels policy at the agency. Lawmakers have for months raised concerns that Icahn's dual role as a high-powered investor and an adviser to President Donald Trump on regulation could lead to conflicts of interest. Icahn, a billionaire, owns the oil refining company CVR Energy , which is heavily impacted by U.S. policies requiring refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline and diesel. The senators - Sheldon Whitehouse, Elizabeth Warren, Debbie Stabenow, Jeff Merkley and Tammy Duckworth - addressed the letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, requesting that he hand over communications between the EPA and Icahn or representatives of CVR Energy. They also requested reports, data and briefings exchanged between the agency and Icahn.  Statements made by him or actions taken by his companies may now be seen as signaling changes in EPA or administration policy which may, in turn, affect the price of CVR stock and the RIN market,  the senators wrote in a letter sent to Pruitt on Tuesday. A RIN, or Renewable Identification Number, is the name given to biofuels blending credits that many refiners are required to purchase under the U.S. biofuels regulation. In February, Icahn, who is an unpaid adviser to Trump, submitted a proposal to the White House to change the U.S. biofuels program, the Renewable Fuel Standard, in a way that would ease the burden on oil refining companies, including his own. A Reuters review of corporate filings in April showed that Icahn's company had also taken a large short position on biofuels credits - a bet that prices for biofuels credits would fall - that would have yielded big profits if the White House adopted the proposal. White House officials have said the EPA is now considering Icahn's proposed overhaul to the biofuels program. The senators gave Pruitt until June 16 to provide the information. The letter comes after the senators twice asked the White House and Icahn for information about his biofuels dealings but received no response. Those senators last month sent a letter to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, urging that it probe Icahn's activity in the market. The CFTC on Monday informed them and four other senators that it will not investigate the credits because RINS are not traded on futures markets.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels-icahn-idUSL1N1J320F"},

Several U.S. airlines and industry groups said they back the global aviation agreement approved by 70 countries, including the United States, to curb greenhouse gases from international flights. Trump said on Thursday the United States would withdraw from the landmark 2015 Paris pact to fight climate change, raising questions about whether he would also seek to back out of the 2021 voluntary phase of the airlines agreement. Air Transport Action Group told reporters at an industry gathering in Cancun, Mexico, on Tuesday that the deal was less costly for carriers than navigating around multiple regional or national rules. Airlines for America, the trade group for major U.S. carriers, said in response to queries from Reuters that it remained committed to the agreement brokered by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). At the Mexico event this week, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and carriers like American Airlines (AAL.O) and United Airlines (UAL.N) reiterated their support for the deal. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said in an email that the aviation agreement was under review, as were all regulatory policies agreed by the Obama administration. There is no deadline for action, she said. Under the global deal, airlines will buy carbon credits from environmental projects around the world to offset growth in emissions from international commercial flights. The deal, known as the Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, has a voluntary phase starting in 2021 and that would become mandatory. Without the pact, airlines would be charged for emissions by regions like Europe.  We believe having a series of national or regional measures overlapping and contradicting each other increases costs, administration, complexity,  said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group.  Having a single global approach brings significant financial and operational benefits,  he told reporters in Cancun. Citing ICAO figures, he said the industry estimates the deal will cost airlines to $1.5 billion to $6.2 billion in 2025, depending on future carbon prices, and no more than 1.8 percent of industry revenues by 2035.  According to ICAO, airlines from 70 States, which account for almost 88 percent of international flights, will be covered by the deal. Russia and India have said they would not participate in the voluntary phase from 2021 to 2026.

Juan Thompson, 32, is set to appear in court next Monday morning to enter a guilty plea, according to the letter, submitted by Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan.  Thompson's attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment. Before his extradition to New York, he denied the charges, said he had no anti-Semitic beliefs and said he was being framed and targeted as a black man.

The prosecution's letter did not give details about the planned plea, which will not become final until Thompson enters it in court. Thompson was arrested in St. Louis, Missouri on March 3, and has been in custody since then, charged with one count of cyberstalking. Federal prosecutors have said Thompson engaged in a vicious, months-long harassment campaign against his ex-girlfriend, using various email accounts to accuse her of possessing child pornography, driving drunk and, finally, making bomb threats targeting Jewish groups. Thompson made some threats in his own name and then accused his ex-girlfriend of framing him, and made other threats posing as her, prosecutors said. U.S. authorities have been investigating a surge of threats against Jewish organizations, including more than 100 bomb threats against community centers in dozens of states in separate waves since January. The organizations Thompson threatened included a Jewish museum in New York and the Anti-Defamation League, according to a criminal complaint in Manhattan federal court. All occurred after the first flood of phone threats in early January. Thompson was a reporter for the Intercept news website, which fired him last year saying he invented sources and quotes.

The Global Dairy Trade (GDT) Price Index climbed 0.6 percent, with an average selling price of $3,395 per tonne, in the auction held on Tuesday.     After two years of declining prices, farmers and analysts had been concerned that a 50 percent rebound during 2016 could be temporary. Prices were also dented at the beginning of the new year as global supply increased.     Much of the gain was from cheddar cheese, which rose 14.5 percent to its highest in nearly three years, while butter was up 3.3 percent.     Nevertheless, there were signs that prices might start to moderate as more supply of milk powder came on the market.      Milk output from NZ is expected to lift this season and Fonterra has already made a small upwards revision in the volume of WMP [whole milk powder] expected to be sold on GDT next season,  said Amy Castleton, analyst at AgriHQ.     GDT Events is owned by New Zealand’s Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd         , the world's largest exporter of dairy, but operates independently from the company.     Whole milk powder edged down 2.9 percent at the latest auction, in line with market expectations.     The auction results can affect the New Zealand dollar          as the dairy sector generates more than 7 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.     The Kiwi rose to a three-month high of $0.7184 from around $0.7170.     A total of 22,004 tonnes was sold at the latest auction, an increase of 3.6 percent from the previous one.

Police detained Taner Kilic and 22 other lawyers in the Aegean coastal province of Izmir on suspicion of ties to the movement of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, it said, citing a detention order. Since the July coup attempt, authorities have arrested 50,000 people and sacked or suspended 150,000, including soldiers, police, teachers and public servants, over alleged links with terrorist groups.  Taner Kilic has a long and distinguished record of defending exactly the kind of freedoms that the Turkish authorities are now intent on trampling,  said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's secretary general. Turkish authorities were not immediately available for comment. Officials say the crackdown is necessary due to the gravity of the coup attempt, in which more than 240 people were killed. Kilic was detained by police at his home in Izmir early on Tuesday before being taken to his office, Amnesty said. Both properties were searched and he remains in police custody. His detention did not appear to be connected to his work with the rights group, nor did it appear to specifically target the organization, Amnesty said. It was unclear why he was suspected of having links to Gulen's network, it said. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied involvement in the coup and condemned it. Critics in Turkey and abroad say President Tayyip Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent and purge opponents. Turkey's interior ministry said on Monday it would strip citizenship from 130 people suspected of militant links, including Gulen, unless they return to Turkey within three months.

May used one of her final speeches in an election campaign which has turned into a debate about national security to step up her rhetoric against Islamist extremism, pledging to ensure security services had the powers they needed. It comes days after Britain's third major terror attack this year, in which seven people were killed when militants plowed a van into pedestrians and then started stabbing people and slitting throats in a busy area of central London. May said authorities needed to be able to do more, including to restrict the movements of suspected militants when police had enough evidence to suspect they presented a threat, but not enough to prosecute them.  If our human rights laws stop us from doing it, we will change the laws so we can do it,  she said to cheers and applause at an election rally. May, a former interior minister, has previously been criticized for scrapping house arrest rules known as 'control orders', which were coming under regular legal challenge.  In Tuesday's speech, she also called for longer prison sentences for people convicted of terrorist offences, and to make it easier to deport foreign suspected militants.  In an interview with the Sun newspaper, May said she would consider extending to 28 days the length of time police can hold people they suspect to be terrorists for questioning. It was reduced to 14 days in 2011. May has promised that if she wins Thursday's election, Britain would remain a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights until 2022, but Tuesday's remarks signal she would look at ways around the rules if necessary.  Last year, she said Britain would make it possible to suspend the ECHR to protect its armed forces serving overseas from  vexatious  human rights claims.

The chairman of the influential House Energy and Commerce Committee said he planned to unveil a package of legislation to overhaul federal rules governing self-driving vehicles.  We're getting very close. I think it's a good package. We've put a lot of work into it,  Representative Greg Walden of Oregon said in an interview, adding that there was  good bipartisan agreeement  and he hoped to unveil and take up the package in the next month or two. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, is also working on a legislative self-driving proposal with Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat.  We're not there yet but we are getting closer,  Thune said. Thune and Walden spoke to Reuters on Tuesday after getting a ride in a self-driving Audi, a unit of Volkswagen AG . Companies such as Alphabet Inc and Ford Motor Co are aggressively pursuing automated technologies and want unified federal regulations to replace outdated rules and make it simpler to develop and eventually sell the technology across the country. This spring, Republican staff drafted a summary of 16 potential legislative proposals on federal reforms and regulations that they circulated to automakers and which was seen by Reuters. Among proposals under consideration is one to allow the U.S. Transportation Department to exempt up to 100,000 autonomous vehicles from current safety standards, which were written on the assumption responsibility for a car's operation rested with the human driver. The existing motor vehicle safety standards bar the sale of vehicles without steering wheels and gas pedals, for example. Alphabet Inc's Waymo unit has called for those rules be changed. Another proposal would prohibit a state from restricting testing by a manufacturer of up to 250 vehicles and comes as automakers have sparred with California over revisions to its self-driving car testing rules. Thune said he planned to hold a hearing on June 14 about self-driving car issues but did not put a specific timetable on introducing legislation. He said he wanted to avoid a  patchwork  of regulations from 50 different states on self-driving cars and look at cybersecurity and other issues.  The key thing is to make sure we stay in the lead on the innovation that there aren't unnecessary roadblocks in the way, balancing that with safety,  Walden said. On Monday, the U.S. Transportation Department said it would unveil revised self-driving guidelines within the next few months, responding to automakers' calls for regulations to sanction costly efforts to put autonomous vehicles on the road. The voluntary guidelines would provide direction to states on self-driving cars as Congress works to set more permanent rules to oversee autonomous vehicles. But legislation might not be approved this year and states and automakers are eager for guidance from regulators in the interim. Vehicle crashes annually kill more than 35,000 people on U.S. roads and injure 2.4 million. Walden said the goal was to get self-driving cars on the roads in big numbers so in a generation people would say:  'What a bunch of barbarians - they drove themselves? Are you kidding me? And look at how many died every year and they thought that was acceptable?' ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-selfdriving-idUSL1N1J31ZN"},

The new unit, with the project name of Boost, is due to launch this autumn and is Air France's response to pressure from Gulf carriers. It will operate 10 long-haul and 18 short-haul aircraft at lower costs than its main brand.  I think people have underestimated the ability of the big carriers and alliances to respond to the Gulf carriers, to budget carriers, to low-cost long-haul,  Jean-Marc Janaillac, chief executive of Franco-Dutch Air France-KLM, said in an interview. He said he believed that pure low-cost rivals in Europe, which typically target leisure customers, would have trouble getting enough demand in the winter months, whereas Boost would attract business customers, who typically fly year-round, thanks to lie-flat seats, air miles and the Air France network.  Studies show that Air France has more difficulty than others in attracting younger customers, because it's seen as too stiff,  Janaillac said. The project and other measures to reduce costs at the carrier are subject to approval from powerful pilot unions.  The SNPL union is due to meet on Thursday. Air France has not said what would happen should the union reject the plan.   I prefer to give dialogue every possible chance and I don't want to specify what will happen after that,  Janaillac said. Air France-KLM plans to add capacity to Italy in the event that Italian flag carrier Alitalia collapses, but is not interested in acquiring the airline, Janaillac said. Alitalia is a partner in the North Atlantic joint venture led by Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) and Air France-KLM and Janaillac said he hoped the administration would find a solution to keep the carrier going.   We are ready to strengthen our presence in Italy. But it's not the outcome we are wishing for,  he said.

Feeder cattle futures         declined by their daily price limit of 4.500 cents per pound while lean hog futures         were mostly 1 percent higher.     Cattle prices were buoyed in recent weeks by rising wholesale beef prices and lower cattle weights - factors that suggested strong demand. But beef prices typically trend lower in the early summer months as retailer buying slows.     Uncertainty surrounding top global beef processor JBS also triggered profit-taking in cattle futures, the traders said.      This was a healthy market correction,  a cattle trader in Chicago said.     Chicago Mercantile Exchange June live cattle        fell 1.900 cents to 130.200 cents per pound. Most-active CME August live cattle        were down 2.600 cents to 123.600 cents per pound, after touching a contract high of 127.650 cents.     CME August feeder cattle        declined 2.7 percent to finish at 155.375 cents per pound, reversing at midday amid heavy selling.          JBS SELLS SOUTH AMERICAN BEEF PLANTS         JBS SA            announced a sale of its meat plants in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay to rival Minerva SA            amid a scandal in which JBS admitted to paying politicians bribes.                  JBS has beef plants in Texas, Nebraska, Michigan and Wisconsin. A U.S. cattle industry group, R-CALF, also released a letter asking President Donald Trump to investigate JBS' business in the United States.     The U.S. Department of Agriculture after the close of futures trading said choice-grade wholesale beef was up $2.10 to $250.45 per cwt, its highest in more than a year. Wholesale pork eased 93 cents to $90.25 per cwt, USDA said.                         Lean hogs futures gained in a rebound from losses on Monday. Prices continued to trend sideways near last week's multimonth highs, with strong pork demand met by abundant hog supplies.     CME June hogs        were up 0.925 cent to 81.650 cents per pound and most-active July hog futures        up 0.950 cent to 81.375 cents.

Trump's @realDonaldTrump account recently blocked a number of accounts that replied to his tweets with commentary that criticized, mocked or disagreed with his actions. Twitter users are unable to see or respond to tweets from accounts that block them.  The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in New York said in its letter that the blocking suppressed speech in a public forum protected by the Constitution. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Twitter Inc said it had no comment. Alex Abdo, the institute's senior staff attorney, likened Twitter to a modern form of town hall meeting or public comment periods for government agency proposals, both venues where U.S. law requires even-handed treatment of speech. Eric Goldman, a Santa Clara University law professor who focuses on internet law, said that previous cases involving politicians blocking users on Facebook (FB.O) supported the Knight Institute's position. If the institute should sue, Trump could claim his @realDonaldTrump account is for personal use and separate from his official duties as president, Goldman said. But he called that defense  laughable.  Trump also has a presidential @POTUS Twitter account. The Knight Institute said its arguments would apply with  equal force  to both accounts.  Trump's Twitter use has drawn intense media attention for his unvarnished commentary about his agenda and attacks on critics. His tweets are often retweeted tens of thousands of times, and can shape the news cycle.  Legal experts have said his tweets may directly affect policy. A chain of postings about his travel ban may hamper his administration's defense in courts. The letter said Trump or his aides blocked the accounts @AynRandPaulRyan and @joepabike, belonging to songwriter Holly O'Reilly and professional cyclist and author Joseph M. Papp, respectively. O'Reilly was blocked on May 28 after posting a brief animated clip of Pope Francis appearing uncomfortable during a meeting with Trump with a caption,  this is pretty much how the whole world sees you,  the letter said. Papp learned he was blocked on June 4 after responding to a Trump tweet with a tweet labeling the president a  #fake leader.  The accounts are just two of several that have been blocked by Trump or his aides, Abdo said.

Edward Pennings, a former senior managing director in State Street's London office, has agreed to plead guilty to one court of conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, according to a plea agreement filed in federal court in Boston. In addition, Richard Boomgaardt, who was head of State Street's transition management desk for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was charged with one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud. Boomgaardt, who lives in the United Kingdom, was charged by  information,  a type of document that prosecutors usually use in connection with defendants who intend to plead guilty. It was unclear if he had reached a plea deal. No plea hearing has been scheduled yet for Pennings, who lives in the United Kingdom. Lawyers for Pennings and Boomgaardt did not respond to requests for comment. The former State Street executives are among three who have been charged by U.S. prosecutors since April 2016 in connection with the probe. The bank agreed in January to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations. The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the Boston-based bank paid a fine of £22.9 million, or $38 million at the time, for charging the six clients mark-ups on certain transactions. Prosecutors said that from 2010 to 2011, Pennings, Boomgaardt and Ross McLellan, a former executive vice president, conspired to add secret commissions to fixed income and equity trades performed for certain clients. Prosecutors said the clients were using a State Street unit that helps institutional customers move investments between asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios. The commissions, which the former executives took steps to hide, came on top of fees the clients agreed to pay despite written instructions to the bank's traders that they should not have to do so, prosecutors have said. The clients included a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund, a public pension fund in Dublin, Ireland, and a pension fund for British government employees, according to court papers. McLellan has pleaded not guilty to securities fraud and wire fraud charges. His trial is scheduled for October. The cases in U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, are U.S. v. McLellan, et al, No. 16-cr-10094, and U.S. v. Boomgaardt, No. 17-cr-10167.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/state-str-fraud-idUSL1N1J31YU"},

After a long discussion on the (party) presidency, it was clear that the party would split,  Ivan Vrdoljak, the head of the Croatian People's Party (HNS), told reporters.  I did not want to let it happen, so eventually I proposed that we do not enter the HDZ-led government which was accepted.  Vrdoljak, who held talks with Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, who also heads the HDZ, on a potential coalition, said he would resign as party leader.  I had sincere intentions to drag Croatia out of (political)turmoil but splitting the party would be too high a price,  Vrdoljak said. Croatia is now a step closer to snap polls as all other key parliamentary parties also voiced unwillingness to join the HDZ-led government. Plenkovic now seems to depend on a possible support of a few independent deputies together with representatives of national minorities, but it would likely make a rather thin and unstable majority. The HDZ and its previous coalition partner, the centre-right Most ( Bridge ) party, split in late April after Most supported the opposition in a no-confidence motion against Finance Minister Zdravko Maric, which he survived by one vote. [nL8N1I63VX] A second snap election after the one held last September, also after a split between the HDZ and the Most, would delay economic reforms needed to improve the investment environment and growth prospects in one of the European Union's weakest economies. Plenkovic must propose four new ministers to parliament to replace those from Most. A vote on those appointments will be a clear test of whether he has secured enough parliamentary support unless he opts for early elections beforehand. Plenkovic said on Tuesday his party favoured political stability but was ready to face snap polls.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index rose 54.78 points, or 0.36 percent, to finish at 15,464.56. Of the index's 10 main groups, four advanced, including a 3.4 percent jump in materials, which include gold miners, and a 1.4 percent lift in oil and gas companies. Gold leaped to a seven-month high on safe-haven demand ahead of a slew of key events on Thursday and after the U.S. dollar fell to a seven-month low. Gold futures rose 1.1 percent to $1,293.8 an ounce. Gold firms dominated the index on the positive side, with Barrick Gold climbing 4.9 percent to C$22.86, and Goldcorp Inc rising 4.5 percent to C$18.89. Kinross Gold Corp rallied 8.6 percent to C$6.21. Iamgold Corp soared 11.7 percent to C$6.78 after Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining Co said it agreed to take an interest in a gold mining project from the company for $195 million. Energy stocks, which have bounced alongside seesawing crude prices, rose as the commodity found technical support after sliding below $47 a barrel. Prices have stumbled amid uncertainty over the impact of an Arab rift over Qatar.  A lot of these names on a year-to-date basis, have been pretty beaten up,  said Manash Goswami, portfolio manager with First Asset Investment Management Inc.  If you're looking for value, you definitely want to look at sectors that have lagged - energy has been one of those.  Goswami said the market was otherwise taking a pause, with overall investor sentiment cautious ahead of a busy Thursday which will see Britain heading to voting booths and former FBI director James Comey testifying before the U.S. Congress. The European Central Bank is also meeting the same day. Tempering gains was a 0.6 percent retreat in financial services companies. The group includes Canada's biggest banks and insurers and accounts for about a third of the index's weight. Manulife Financial Corp declined 1.5 percent to C$23.15, while Royal Bank of Canada gave up 0.8 percent to finish at C$92.81. Hudson's Bay Co, which reports quarterly results on Thursday, fell 3.5 percent to C$9.73, tracking U.S. department store stocks which slumped after Macy's Inc warned of a bigger-than-expected drop in gross margins. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the TSX by 141 to 101, for a 1.40-to-1 ratio on the upside.

Other New Zealand crew members, including helmsman Peter Burling, were left suspended in the upturned hull of their 50-foot catamaran until support boats could right the craft. The boat showed signs of damage from the high-speed impact with the waters of Bermuda's Great Sound, where winds were gusting near the maximum allowed for America's Cup racing. Burling said the boat had  sustained quite a bit of damage  in the capsize, but none of the crew was badly injured.  We'll bounce back from this but right now we are still assessing the damage,  Burling said, adding that he could not say whether the boat would be back on the water on Wednesday.  We were really thankful that no-one was hurt,  he said in a televised news briefing after the race.  We've all got a few cuts and bruises, but nothing major.  British skipper Ben Ainslie likened controlling the foiling catamarans in such conditions to  skiing on ice , adding that he had to sail the boat at maximum speed and hope for the best.  These boats are incredibly hard to sail,  Ainslie told a televised news briefing after the race, adding that New Zealand appeared to have made a slight misjudgement. Nathan Outteridge, skipper of Sweden's Artemis Racing which is competing in the other challenger semi-final against SoftBank Team Japan, said his crew had also had  plenty of close moments  as the catamarans reached speeds nearing 50 knots (92.6 kilometers per hour), flying above the waves on their foils. Safety has been a major concern of all the crews and the organizers since the death of British sailor Andrew  Bart  Simpson in San Francisco ahead of the 2013 America's Cup. Sailors have helmets, buoyancy aids, oxygen tanks and knives in case their boats get into trouble. Ainslie and Iain Percy, the team manager and tactician on Artemis Racing, were best friends with Simpson and helped set up a charity to promote sailing for young people after his death. Pitch-Poled Ainslie, the most successful Olympic sailor, got the better of Burling at the start, ensuring a clean run over the line. But when the New Zealand crew set off in pursuit, they lost control of their catamaran, immersing its hulls in the water and tipping their towering  wing  sail over them as the boat  pitch-poled  forwards and came to a startling halt. Support boats quickly surrounded the stricken catamaran and the organizers could be heard saying that the crew were all accounted for as some of the New Zealand team swam away. The capsize meant Land Rover BAR won the race, giving them some hope of recouping some of their deficit against New Zealand who are now leading 3-1 in the best-of-nine race series. The British crew had suffered equipment failure on Monday when part of their wing controls broke, meaning they had to forfeit two races to their New Zealand opponents. In the day's other semi-final, SoftBank Team Japan, skippered by New Zealander Dean Barker, took a 3-1 lead over Artemis Racing after winning both their races. Artemis Racing struggled to control their boat, at one point in their second race sailing off the course completely and incurring a penalty from which they could not recover. The winners of the two semi-finals will go head-to-head to decide who gets to challenge holders Oracle Team USA for the America's Cup itself, starting on June 17.

Now in its 28th year, the One World Media Awards celebrate journalistic excellence in coverage of the developing world. Gebrekidan, an Ethiopia-born Reuters journalist based in New York, was recognized as International Journalist of the Year for her searing trilogy documenting the journeys of three groups of migrants from Eritrea for Reuters, in a series called The Migration Machine. The first, centered on 16-year-old Girmay Mehari, revealed how smugglers prey on refugees’ relatives worldwide to extract money for journeys that often end in death. The second story uncovered  how Islamic State, battling for its survival in Libya, is profiting from the migrant flow to Europe by turning women migrants like 24-year-old Ruta Fisehaye into sex slaves. The third story took Gebrekidan to Libya, where she documented how a mother and 12-year-old daughter, after escaping captivity as Islamic State sex slaves, were imprisoned by local militia on the baseless charge of belonging to the extremist group themselves. Getting these stories required more than reporting prowess; equally challenging was that Gebrekidan lived through some of these ordeals with her sources, in real time, at some of the most harrowing or moving moments of their lives.  The One World Media Award is one of ten recognitions The Migration Machine has received this year, both for Gebrekidan’s coverage and for another groundbreaking article in the series, an investigation of a migrant shipwreck by Stephen Grey and Amina Ismail. Recognitions include a Society of American Business Editors and Writers Award, a Deadline Club Award and a New York Press Club Award, as well as being named a finalist for the Michael Kelly Award and a Press Award.

A rally in cryptocurrency Ethereum has boosted demand for graphics chips used by people to  mine  it and other digital currencies, with some of AMD's processors sold out on Amazon.com and other retail websites. Mining for cryptocurrency involves using networks of computers to validate transactions and prevent counterfeit by solving complex mathematical problems. New currency is generated as a reward to the computer operators. The emergence of Bitcoin in 2009 made cryptocurrency mining popular. Recent rallies in the price of Bitcoin and newer digital currency Ethereum have rekindled interest. Ethereum miners spending as little as $2,000 to build mining computers using graphics processing units, or GPUs, from AMD or its rival Nvidia could break even within three or four months, estimated RBC analyst Mitch Steves in a note to clients on Tuesday.   We think economics suggests that GPUs continue to be sold out,  Steves wrote.  We think GPU demand will remain robust as long as the return is under (about) one year.  As of Monday, AMD short sellers had been up about $15 million for 2017. But Tuesday’s share surge left them at a loss of $125 million on paper for the year, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.  That follows losses of over $700 million for AMD short sellers last year, when the stock tripled. The stock last traded up 7.3 percent at $12.06.  There are going to be a lot of traders saying, 'This is the last straw. I'm out,'  said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3's managing director of research. AMD spokesman Drew Prairie acknowledged that interest from cryptocurrency miners was contributing to demand for the company's chips, but he stressed that game enthusiasts are the core market. JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft Corp, Intel Corp and more than two dozen other companies have teamed up to develop standards to make it easier for enterprises to use technology related to Ethereum. Adding to support for AMD's stock, Apple on Monday refreshed its lineup of Mac personal computers, including upgraded graphics chips from AMD.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-amd-stocks-idUSKBN18X2NJ"},

The officials filed a legal brief with the Supreme Court as it mulls whether to take up the Trump administration's appeal of lower court rulings blocking the travel ban signed by the Republican president on March 6 and let it go into effect. In the states' brief, filed on Monday, Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller wrote that the executive order does not mention religion at all and distinguishes people based only on nationality.  The executive order therefore is emphatically not a 'Muslim ban,'  Keller wrote. Keller added that courts should be careful when second-guessing a president's national security determinations, an argument that echoes the administration's view that the judiciary should defer to the president on such matters. The brief said the order did not violation the Constitution's ban on the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion or its guarantee of due process. The filing came after the administration asked the high court last Thursday to allow the order to take effect. Aside from Texas, the officials were Republican state attorneys general from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia, as well as Mississippi's Republican governor. Three Republican attorneys general came from states with Democratic governors: Louisiana, Montana and West Virginia. Most of the states had also backed Trump earlier in the litigation. Many Democratic state officials have opposed the ban in lower courts. The high court is due to review legal papers filed by the ban's challengers, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, before acting. The briefs are due on Monday. A key issue before the justices in whether Trump's comments during the 2016 president campaign, including calling for  a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,  can be used as evidence that his order was intended to discriminate against Muslims. The administration filed emergency applications with the justices seeking to block lower court rulings that went against Trump's order barring entry for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the U.S. government implements stricter visa screening. Trump's order also called for suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days. The move comes after the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on May 25 upheld a Maryland judge's ruling blocking the order. Potentially making it harder for his lawyers to win at the Supreme Court, Trump again commented on the case on Monday, tweeting complaints that his own administration had issued a  watered down, politically correct version  of an earlier order he signed on Jan. 27 that also was blocked by courts.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-immigration-idUSL1N1J31XN"},

Growth in the developed economies over the past two decades has either been sub-par or artificially and often dangerously supported by debt and asset bubbles. One key factor behind this weakness, which leads some economist to argue we are in a period of “secular stagnation,” is the steady downward trend of productivity growth. U.S. output per hour worked advanced on average only 0.6 percent annually over the past five years, compared to rates over 3 percent in the early years of the millennium. Arguments rage over why, with some holding that all the low-hanging fruit of technological improvements has been picked and some that demographics are trapping us in a low-investment, low-growth world. But investment manager PIMCO, with some supporting data from consultants McKinsey & Company, argues we may soon be seeing a dramatic increase in productivity as already discovered technology is adapted. “A productivity-driven return to 'old normal' 4-percent-plus global GDP growth may lie within reach in the coming years, based only on the spread ('diffusion') of existing technologies,” Joachim Fels and Matthew Tracey of PIMCO write. (here) They caution that this isn’t their base case, just a growing outside possibility, but it is hard to express exactly how surprising and electrifying this would be to investors inured to very low rates and low growth. Many of the puzzles and features of the current economic landscape - very low or negative interest rates, quantitative easing and low growth - would be reversed or at least mitigated by structurally higher productivity. There is no small irony too that what we are discussing is not the kind of top-down solutions which have failed or worked weakly in recent years, but a bottom-up story in which new technology is adapted and knit together in new ways to increase output. To be sure, even this story doesn’t necessarily end happily, given that many of the technologies, from robotics to the use of computer-controlled printers to perform 3-D manufacturing, will destroy jobs and may increase income inequality. But even for this to happen, the adaptation of technology will need to quicken. Doctors Looking at Screens McKinsey, in a 2015 study, said it saw potential for global productivity to more than double its 1.8 percent average rate of growth over the past half century. “Five sector case studies - agriculture, food processing, automotive, retail, and healthcare - suggest that annual productivity growth to 2025 in the G19 and Nigeria could be as high as 4 percent, more than needed to counteract demographic trends,” according to a report from the McKinsey Global Institute. (here) That’s all premised on the intelligent spread of existing technology, and three quarters of the potential growth simply comes from the broader used of 'best practices' already significantly in use. Some of this is nothing more complex than the use, in places like Korea and Japan, of existing retail inventory management techniques. Some is more futuristic, like the use by Amazon of artificial intelligence and robotics to make warehouse and shipping management more efficient. Or take for example U.S. healthcare, in which cumbersome information technology means doctors and nurses spend much time looking at screens, often at the expense of gathering more useful information from patients. Costs of new technology are also coming down, making it more feasible for individual dental practices to have 3-d printers. (here) As implied, some of this is geographic, as technology spreads more deeply into emerging markets, while some is vertical, where smaller firms play catch-up to avoid destruction by the likes of Amazon. The spread of technology will destroy jobs and tend to reward capital, of both the intellectual and financial sorts, increasing inequality and social and political tension. Production, which has long spread around the world to arbitrage labor cost differences, will tend to gravitate towards end markets, both because it is less labor-dependent and also because more of the value is in proprietary software and processes. That could throw up political roadblocks to adaptation, as a look at the recent flourishing of populist and often anti-globalization politicians illustrates. Fels and Tracey of PIMCO argue that high-tech-driven productivity need not be a zero-sum game, and could lead to increased competition and employment. One thing a boost to growth would definitely mean is a hit to the value of bonds, as markets re-set to a more normal yield curve. There are worse problems to have, even for bond investors.

The Warriors are in command of their NBA Finals clash with the Cleveland Cavaliers after winning the first two games of the best-of-seven series and are suddenly standing on the brink of history as the first team to go 16-0 in the playoffs.  We want 15-0. That's what we want. We literally have never once mentioned 16-0,  Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters on Tuesday.  To me it's a miracle that it's even a possibility. It's so hard to do.   But we are here, we're more focused on what happened last year like in terms of we were up 2-0 and we came here and the series shifted. That's the important lesson, not any historical benchmarks or anything like that.  Golden State held an identical series lead in 2016 when the championship series shifted to Cleveland but split the two games there and then went on to become the first team to lose an NBA Finals after building a 3-1 advantage. But that Warriors team, which posted a record 73 wins in the 2015-16 season, were not as dangerous as the current squad due to the addition of four-times scoring champion Kevin Durant to an already formidable lineup. With Durant, the Warriors reached the NBA Finals a perfect 12-0 in the postseason after sweeping each of the previous three rounds and then found another gear against the Cavaliers.

Lawmakers have for months raised concerns that Icahn's dual role as a high-powered investor and an adviser to President Donald Trump on regulation could lead to conflicts of interest. Icahn, a billionaire, owns the oil refining company CVR Energy , which is heavily impacted by U.S. policies requiring refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline and diesel. The senators - Sheldon Whitehouse, Elizabeth Warren, Debbie Stabenow, Jeff Merkley and Tammy Duckworth - addressed the letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, requesting that he hand over communications between the EPA and Icahn or representatives of CVR Energy. They also requested reports, data and briefings exchanged between the agency and Icahn.  Statements made by him or actions taken by his companies may now be seen as signaling changes in EPA or administration policy which may, in turn, affect the price of CVR stock and the RIN market,  the senators wrote in a letter sent to Pruitt on Tuesday. A RIN, or Renewable Identification Number, is the name given to biofuels blending credits that many refiners are required to purchase under the U.S. biofuels regulation. In February, Icahn, who is an unpaid adviser to Trump, submitted a proposal to the White House to change the U.S. biofuels program, the Renewable Fuel Standard, in a way that would ease the burden on oil refining companies, including his own. A Reuters review of corporate filings in April showed that Icahn's company had also taken a large short position on biofuels credits - a bet that prices for biofuels credits would fall - that would have yielded big profits if the White House adopted the proposal. White House officials have said the EPA is now considering Icahn's proposed overhaul to the biofuels program. The senators gave Pruitt until June 16 to provide the information. The letter comes after the senators twice asked the White House and Icahn for information about his biofuels dealings but received no response. Those senators last month sent a letter to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, urging that it probe Icahn's activity in the market. The CFTC on Monday informed them and four other senators that it will not investigate the credits because RINS are not traded on futures markets.

The measure, to be signed by Mayor Ed Murray on Tuesday, was approved on a 7-1 vote despite staunch opposition from the American Beverage Association, which said the tax would hit poor and working-class families and small businesses hardest. Enactment will add Washington state's largest city to a growing national movement seeking to curb consumption of soft drinks and other high-caloric beverages that medical experts say are largely to blame for an epidemic of childhood obesity. Other localities that have adopted similar measures during the past few years include Philadelphia, San Francisco, its Bay-area neighbors of Berkeley, Oakland and Albany, California, Boulder, Colorado, and Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago. A growing body of research has identified sugary drinks as the biggest contributors to added, empty calories in the American diet, and as a major culprit in a range of costly health problems associated with being overweight. Under the measure, due to go into effect in January, distributors of all bottled and canned sodas, juice drinks, sports and energy drinks, flavored waters, sweetened teas and ready-to-drink coffee beverages sold in Seattle would pay a tax of 1.75 cents per ounce. At that rate, the cost of a typical 12-ounce can of soda would rise by 21 cents. An equivalent rate would be collected on the syrups used to sweeten fountain drinks sold by restaurants, convenience stores and fast-food outlets in the city. As higher costs are passed on to consumers, supporters aim to put a dent in sales, as was the case in Berkeley, where according to public health officials retail purchases of sugar-sweetened beverages dropped nearly 10 percent during the first year of that city's soda tax. The new Seattle soda levy is projected to generate about $15 million in revenue a year. One-hundred-percent fruit juices and zero-calorie diet drinks are to be exempted, along with dairy-based beverages. But the language of the measure leaves unclear whether an exemption applies to syrups used in milk-based coffee drinks prepared to order by baristas in coffee shops including those in the Seattle-based Starbucks chain. City Councilman Tim Burgess, the measure's chief sponsor, said those details would be ironed out through implementing regulations still to be developed by the mayor's office. Starbucks did not respond to a request for comment.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/seattle-sodatax-idUSL1N1J31WR"},

Superior Court Judge Mary Ames in Boston in a ruling last week declined to dismiss the lawsuit by the doctors, one of whom is suffering from cancer, who argued a cloud of uncertainty was preventing physicians from providing such medications. The doctors have proven there is a controversy regarding the law that is worth the court's time to consider, Ames said in the decision, noting that she had not yet made a determination on the merits of their argument. The lawsuit aims to include Massachusetts among states such as Oregon, Washington, Vermont, California and Colorado and the District of Columbia that allow physicians to provide aid in dying, according to right-to-die advocates. The Massachusetts ruling was in response to a lawsuit by Roger Kligler, a retired doctor diagnosed with stage-four prostate cancer, and Alan Steinbach, a physician who says he is willing to write prescriptions for lethal medication but fears prosecution. The lawsuit seeks a ruling holding that manslaughter charges cannot be applied to physicians who write a prescription to terminally ill competent adults who request medication that they could choose to self-administer to aid in their death.  We are pleased with the court's decision because it will allow our clients to challenge the constitutionality of the law without having to take actions that could risk prosecution by an aggressive district attorney,  said John Kappos, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. A spokeswoman for Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who was named as a defendant along with the Cape and Islands County district attorney and is defending the case, declined to comment. Healey's office had in court argued the court should defer to the state legislature to decide the issue and ensure safeguards are enacted to protect vulnerable patients and the integrity of the medical community. The lawsuit is being pursued by nonprofit right-to-die organization Compassion and Choices. The Massachusetts legislature has considered, but never enacted, legislation to allow physicians to provide aid in dying.

Wade,USA,ABORTION/DELAWARE,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - The Delaware House of Representatives was poised to vote on Tuesday on a Senate-approved bill that would guarantee abortion access after U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to upend the ruling that legalizes the procedure nationally. Delaware's legislation aims to codify at the state level the provisions of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that protects a woman's right to abortion. Trump, a Republican whose election was backed by anti-abortion groups, has promised to appoint justices to the nation's top court who would overturn Roe v. Wade and let states decide whether to legalize abortion. Both chambers of the Delaware legislature are controlled by Democrats, and Governor John Carney Jr. also is a Democrat. Passage of the bill through the House could position Delaware to become the first state to guarantee access to abortion since Trump was elected president. A bill to support abortion rights was approved by the Illinois legislature in May but the state's Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, has vowed to veto it. In January, New York's Assembly adopted legislation similar to Delaware's, but it has stalled in the Senate. Carney has been following debate on the bill and has not yet said if he will sign it into law, said his spokeswoman Jessica Borcky.  But the governor supports the rights and protections afforded women under Roe v. Wade,  Borcky said. If the bill clears the House and is sent to the governor, he must sign or veto it within 10 days, or the measure automatically becomes law. Abortion opponents lobbied against the legislation, concerned it could turn Delaware into  a late-term abortion haven,  said Delaware Right to Life spokeswoman Moira Sheridan. If it passes, the group will take its fight to the governor's office, she said.

Trump,John Cornyn,Lindsay Walters,Marc Short,Mitch McConnell,Paul Ryan,Richard Cowan,Susan Cornwell,USA,TRUMP/CONGRESS,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is hoping to kick-start its stalled legislative agenda with congressional action on healthcare reform this summer that will clear the way for lawmakers to begin work on a major tax bill after the Sept. 4 Labor Day holiday, an administration official said on Monday. Senate Republicans will vote on their version of healthcare reform legislation before lawmakers' August recess, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short said. The House of Representatives passed a bill in May.  There's been a lot of discussions with staff,  Short told reporters at a briefing.  I think the text is pretty far along.  Congress will then turn its focus to overhauling the tax code in September. While the administration would prefer that the effort not add to the national debt, Short stressed that the top priority would be cutting taxes.  We want it to be revenue neutral, and we are still supportive of tax reform, but I am also saying to you that what we believe is most important to get the economy going is the tax cuts,  he said. President Donald Trump will meet with the Republican leaders of the House and the Senate, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, on Tuesday to discuss the path forward for his agenda, said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters. Trump has pressed for quicker action in Congress, but his administration has also been hampered by investigations into alleged ties between Trump's election campaign and Russia. The Trump administration has outlined a broad plan that would cut tax rates for businesses and streamline the tax system for individuals. But, the proposal has been short on details -- including the cost of the tax cuts and what loopholes would be closed. The healthcare bill passed by the House could result in 23 million people losing insurance, the Congressional Budget Office estimated, a conclusion that Republicans were quick to challenge. The bill would also reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026, according to the analysis. Short said he believed that the Senate healthcare bill would be  similar  to the House package. Senator John Cornyn, the No.2 Republican in the Senate, said Monday evening he thought there would be a vote on a healthcare bill in the Senate in July. Short also said the White House expects for Congress to raise the government's borrowing authority, also known as the debt limit, before the August recess.

The  Algiers declaration  came after Egyptian jets last month carried out repeated air strikes targeting camps for Islamist militants inside Libya who Cairo says were responsible for an attack on Egyptian Christians. The joint statement appeared to be an effort to smooth over differences among the North African neighbors over how to bring stability to Libya, where rival armed and political factions have been fighting since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. A U.N.-backed government installed in Tripoli is trying to expand its influence and work with Western powers on security and immigration. But it has been rejected by some armed factions inside Tripoli and powerful rivals to the east backed by military commander Khalifa Hafter.  Algeria has been pushing for an inclusive dialogue in Libya, while Egypt has more openly voiced support for Haftar, who has launched campaigns against Islamist militants and has so far rejected a U.N.-backed government in Tripoli. The ministers focused on the  preservation of territorial integrity, sovereignty and unity of Libya , they said at the end of their closed-door meeting.  The political solution is the only way to resolve the crisis through inclusive dialogue, the rejection of interference and military options,  said the statement on Algeria's state news agency APS. Egypt sees any militant activity in eastern Libya, which is near its border, as a threat to its own national security. One of the reasons Egypt's leadership has supported Haftar since 2014 is to try to ensure all Islamists are driven from eastern Libya.

Hong Kong, at the mouth of China's Pearl River Delta, is one of the world’s top global transit hubs for endangered species and their products, like ivory, shark fin, pangolin and rosewood. Shark fin and pangolin are considered delicacies in China and the scales of pangolin, one of the most widely trafficked wild animals in the world, are used in traditional Chinese medicine. The hearing, held in the legislature, was marked by a testy standoff between traders, who argue their business is legal, and conservationists who say Hong Kong’s prime role is pushing elephants towards extinction. The former British colony has lagged behind other places, including China, in implementing tighter regulations, or bans, on trading of ivory and shark fin. The United States, Singapore and China have banned the ivory trade and the mainland will close down all such operations by the end of this year. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, has only timetabled a ban by 2021.  If you are to be in Africa today, you can see how people are suffering. I am pleading with you this trade should come to an end,  Josias Mungabwa, a former wildlife crime investigator with the Zambian Wildlife Authority Investigations and Intelligence Unit, said. Hong Kong has the largest retail market for ivory with 90 percent of consumers from the mainland. The trade has been active for more than 150 years with ivory made into jewellery and sculptures. Groups including the World Wildlife Fund state that loopholes in Hong Kong's regulatory system mean that traders can use a stockpile of legal ivory as a front while they smuggle illegal ivory to unsuspecting buyers. Erik Mararv, manager of Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, said 100 elephants are poached a day while 1,000 rangers have been killed over the last 10 years trying to protect them. Ahead of the hearing, activists waving graphic placards showing dead elephants were accompanied by a giant inflatable elephant and a Senegalese drumming band which drowned out the shouts from jeering ivory traders. Later in the week, a protest outside a famous restaurant by the city’s trademark harbour is planned against the shark fin trade. A study from Hong Kong’s Shark Foundation released on May 31 showed large restaurant groups were serving shark fin from endangered species like the dusky shark and the silky shark. Elizabeth Quat, a legislator who has lobbied the government to strengthen the combat of wildlife smuggling, said she hoped an official bill to ban the import of ivory would be introduced by the end of this year.  Today we are reaching the last battle... It is the last chance in our generation to save such a beautiful species,  she said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/hongkong-wildlife-idUSL1N1J31VK"},

At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3439 to the greenback, or 74.41 U.S. cents, up 0.3 percent.     The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3485, while it touched its strongest since May 31 at C$1.3438.      There is not a lot of conviction in the markets,  said Scott Lampard, head of global markets at HSBC Bank Canada.      A lot of clients have got themselves to be where they want to be risk wise and they are just waiting for Thursday's three developments.      The European Central Bank meeting, a parliamentary election in the UK and testimony by former U.S. FBI Director James Comey to a Senate committee are due on Thursday.         Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, found technical support after sliding below $47 a barrel on pressure from a diplomatic rift in the Middle East and sustained high crude inventories in the United States.                  U.S. crude oil futures settled 79 cents higher at $48.19 a barrel.     The Bank of Canada's review of developments in the financial system is also due on Thursday, followed by a news conference with Governor Stephen Poloz. Investors will weigh Poloz's assessment of the health of the housing and mortgage markets in light of recent troubles at non-bank lender Home Capital.     U.S. Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar        dropped to seven-month lows and world stocks slid as political uncertainty from the United States to the Middle East pushed investors away from risky assets.                  Canadian government bond prices were higher across most of a flatter yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The 10-year             rose 18 Canadian cents to yield 1.393 percent. It touched its lowest intraday since Nov. 10 at 1.373 percent.      What we are seeing is a rotation out of the riskier end of the fixed income market into lower-risk credit instruments  Lampard said.

The top-seeded Warriors have used their free-firing, run-and-gun style to grab a 2-0 lead in the NBA's best-of-seven championship but the Cavaliers insist they would not benefit from slowing down the tempo.  That's not our game. We don't play slowdown basketball,  Cavaliers forward LeBron James told reporters on Tuesday in Cleveland, site of the next two games.  We play at our pace. We play our game. We got to this point playing our way. We have won a lot of games playing the way we play, so we're not going to change.  The defending NBA champion Cavaliers also play at a fast pace but that approach has resulted in a pair of lopsided losses that have the Warriors two wins from the first perfect 16-0 postseason in NBA history. James, the most prolific scorer in NBA playoff history, said he was content with the more physical effort his team showed in the second game of the series and that the Cavaliers' gameplan, if executed for 48 minutes, gives them a chance to win.

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY SportsLed by two-times reigning MVP Stephen Curry and four-times scoring champion Kevin Durant, the Warriors have an embarrassment of riches and find ways to score regardless of the pace of any particular game. But rather than fretting about the talent on the other end of the floor, Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue said his team simply need to focus on not turning the ball over or letting the Warriors get out in transition.  We're not going to change our game because of who we're playing,  said Lue.  And I'm confident that we can play that way, and we did it last year.  A lot of people said we couldn't. But that's our game. That's who we are. And we're not going to change just because we're playing Golden State.

Utility stocks, with hefty dividends, are among the sectors considered  bond proxies  and have benefited from declines in longer-dated Treasury yields this year.  We think the utilities are overvalued,  said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments.  They are getting a last tailwind from this drop in yields, but I don't think that it will persist.  Goldman Sachs, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse have recommended since last year that investors be  underweight  in utilities. Major investment banks generally are preferring sectors that should thrive during economic expansions.  Being in a growth cycle, we would like to take the money out of utilities,  said Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. About $800 million flowed out of U.S.-listed mutual and exchange traded funds this year after $4.7 billion in such outflows in the second half of 2016, according to Lipper data.    Still, the S&P; 500 utilities sector has climbed 10.5 percent this year, topping an 8.6 percent rise for the overall S&P; 500 index. The sector includes power and energy companies such as NextEra Energy, Duke Energy and Dominion Energy and offers an overall dividend yield of 3.4 percent. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which analysts compare to utilities, on Tuesday fell to 2.13 percent. That was the lowest since just after President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election stirred expectations of inflation and increased growth that lifted 10-year bond yields.  The basic fundamental reason for the decline in the 10-year yield is that investors are looking for safety,  said Ali Agha, analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  That is the same dynamic that would lead to them to utilities.  Utilities are trading at a 2 percent premium to the broader market, based on price-to-earnings ratios. Historically, the group has traded at a 7.5 percent discount. Analysts expect virtually no profit growth for the sector this year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Results may be hurt as milder weather crimps power demand this year and margins are pressured for companies operating in deregulated power markets, Evercore ISI analyst Greg Gordon said. But the highly regulated nature of most utilities means investors should be able to count on mid-single-digit profit and dividend growth over the next three to five years, Gordon said. (To view a graphic on 'Utilities stocks vs. other  bond proxy  sectors' click reut.rs/2swa4nO) Bond-proxy sectors historically have been relied on for a  smoother ride  than the broader market because they rise less in a market rally and fall less in a sell-off, said Jonathan Golub, chief equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. But that link has weakened recently.  The market is getting increasingly concerned about interest rates and therefore the groups that are normally the most sensitive to rates are becoming hypersensitive,  Golub said.  If we were to see rates go up toward, let's say 3 percent, on a 10-year bond, I think that these guys have the risk of getting clobbered.

Valeria Khadija Collina, who is Italian and converted to Islam, spoke in an interview with Italy's L'Espresso news magazine about her son, Youssef Zaghba, 22, one of the perpetrators of the June 3 attack.   When children make mistakes, parents always feel some guilt. But I did my best, and I think he was worn down on the inside,  she said. Collina lives near the northern city of Bologna.  We always kept track of his friends and made sure he didn't fall in with the wrong people. But he had internet and that's where everything comes from,  she said Collina visited her son in London, and  that neighborhood did not make me feel comfortable,  she said.  I was there and didn't like it. He spent his time with the wrong kind of people.  Collina said she had spoken to Italy's anti-terrorism police last year after her son was prevented from traveling to the Middle East, and that they were the ones to told her on Tuesday that her son had been one of the men who carried out the attack.  Zaghba was stopped at the airport in Bologna in 2016 when he was trying to get to Syria via Turkey, city prosecutor Giuseppe Amato told broadcaster Radio24 on Tuesday .  A person going to Turkey with a backpack aroused some suspicion, also because he told the agent who checked him that he wanted to go and be a terrorist, then he corrected himself,  Amato said.   Italian national Youssef Zaghba, 22, identified by Italian and British law enforcement bodies as the the third man shot dead by police officers during the attack on London Bridge and Borough Market is seen in an undated image handed out by the Metropolitan Police, June 6, 2017, Metropolitan Police Handout via REUTERSCollina said her son had been enticed to try to go to Syria by a  fantasy that was transmitted by Internet  in which he thought he could  live according to pure Islam , but that he did not mention wanting to fight there.  Investigators confiscated Zaghba's computer but did not have proof of a crime. They returned the device but pointed him out to London as a possible suspect, Amato said. British police said Zaghba had not been a subject of interest for them or the domestic intelligence agency MI5 before he and two others launched their attack.  Slideshow (2 Images)Collina said she last spoke to her son two days before the attack and that in retrospect she realizes  it was a goodbye call . She also said she agreed with the Muslim religious leaders who refused to recite funeral prayers for the attackers.  I understand and agree with their choice because it is necessary to send a strong political message,  Collina said.  Her son and the two other attackers rammed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge, then ran into the Borough Market area, and slit throats and stabbed people indiscriminately before they were shot and killed by police. Italian media said Zaghba was born in the Moroccan city of Fez in 1995 but had broken off relations with his Moroccan father. He lived in Morocco for much of his life but made short visits to his mother. He spent a total of 10 days in Italy in the past year and a half, the Bologna prosecutor said.  Collina said she would dedicate her life to fighting Islamic State ideology by  teaching real Islam to people and trying to convince families to fill the void that they might find in their children .

Thabane's All Basotho Convention (ABC) won 48 parliamentary seats, compared with 30 won by incumbent Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili's Democratic Congress (DC), according to results released on Tuesday by the Independent Electoral Commission.  The ABC will form a coalition government with the Alliance of Democrats, the Basotho National Party and the Reformed Congress of Lesotho to reach the 61-seat majority required to form a government, the parties said in a joint statement.  The people have spoken in a loud voice and as the four parties we have accepted their mandate and promise to serve them,  the four parties said.  We'd like to announce to Basotho and the international community that together we have enough votes to form a coalition government.  The election outcome reverses the result of an election two years ago, when Mosisili's DC ousted Thabane and the ABC by uniting with smaller parties. But Mosisili lost a confidence vote in parliament in March after several defections by ruling coalition lawmakers to the opposition eroded his support. Lesotho, a nation of 2 million people, has been hit by several coups since gaining independence from Britain in 1966 and its last two elections failed to produce a winner with a clear majority. Thabane, who governed from 2012 until 2015, and other opposition leaders fled the country to South Africa in 2015 after an assassination attempt on his life.

Bush,Jeffrey Wall,Mark Foster,Richard Painter,Thomas Morgan,Trump,US,OTC,ETHICS,Analyses,United States","sector":"Subjects","content":"(This post has been updated to add context.) (Quote in 8th paragraph may be objectionable to some readers.)  Ethics rules prohibit lawyers from presenting arguments in briefs and in court that they do not believe to be true. So how will President Trump’s defiant tweetstorm on Monday morning, disdaining the “watered down, politically correct” travel ban he signed after his original executive order was deemed unconstitutional, constrain Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall and his DOJ team as they attempt to reinstate the travel ban at the U.S. Supreme Court?  Ethics experts I consulted on Tuesday offered a wide range of opinions on that question, though they agreed the Justice Department will have to be careful not to take positions contradicted by Trump’s tweets. At best, the experts said, the solicitor general’s office can no longer argue that the president himself wanted the executive order only to pause immigration from six Muslim-majority countries temporarily so the U.S. can study its vetting procedures.  At worst, the Justice Department could be subject to an ethics inquiry about whether its lawyers knowingly misrepresented facts in their Supreme Court filings. I left a message at the SG’s office, asking about ethical concerns in light of the president’s tweets, but didn’t get a response.  The Justice Department’s June 1 petition for Supreme Court review of the en banc opinion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, holding the travel ban to violate the First Amendment, emphasizes the Trump administration’s core argument that the 4th Circuit erred in considering the president’s motives. According to the petition, Congress and the Supreme Court have agreed that the executive branch has extremely broad discretion to set immigration policies to assure national security.  The petition repeatedly refers to the “temporary” suspension of immigration from the affected countries, including in two of the three questions the filing presents. The words “travel ban” do not appear in the filing, and the only time the Justice Department uses the phrase “Muslim ban” is to say the executive order was not one.  The president’s tweets Monday – which affirmed his belief that “what we need” is “a TRAVEL BAN” – do not ethically constrain the Justice Department from continuing to argue for executive branch discretion to set immigration policy. But they do mean the solicitor general’s office can’t argue the president wanted only a temporary suspension of immigration to study vetting procedures. “You cannot say the president intends this to be a temporary ban if what he says implies that it will apply ad infinitum,” said Mark Foster of Zuckerman Spaeder.  Foster said the Justice Department can still make “artful” arguments that the Supreme Court should focus on the executive branch’s authority to do what the order actually sets out to accomplish without attempting to justify the president’s tweets. Thomas Morgan, an ethics professor at George Washington, also said in an email that the Justice Department’s ethical responsibility “is to argue the authority of any president to do what this one did, not to get bogged down in the content of the current president's Twitter posts.”  Both Foster and Morgan said, however, that Trump’s tweets will make those arguments more challenging for Justice lawyers. “Can they say it’s only a temporary ban if the president says that’s bullshit?” Foster said. “I think they’re in a tough spot. He’s put them in a tough spot.”  Or worse, according to former George W. Bush ethics counsel Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor and ardent Trump critic. Painter told me that if the acting SG and his colleagues knew or should have known the temporary immigration suspension was a pretext for President Trump to ban immigration from the affected countries, they may have committed ethical violations.  “There’s a prima facie case that their briefing was factually inaccurate,” Painter said, pointing to the petition’s emphasis on the temporary suspension of immigration from the affected countries. The president’s tweets, Painter said, make it clear that Trump wants a longer-lasting ban. So the key question, according to him, is whether Justice Department lawyers knew when they submitted the petition for Supreme Court review that the temporary suspension could be a pretext for more sweeping action.  “There’s significant evidence these lawyers were not honest,” Painter said. “The Supreme Court should make an inquiry.” He conceded that he doesn’t know if the justices have ever conducted such an ethics investigation but said that at the very least the court ought to ask the Justice Department what it knew about the president’s intentions at the time of its filing and whether DOJ presented the facts accurately.  In a follow-up interview, Painter could not point to specific evidence of dishonesty but said that in his experience, Justice Department lawyers assure themselves of the views of the White House before representing those views at the Supreme Court. He said that DOJ lawyers could not be faulted if President Trump’s tweets Monday represent a new White House position but said the president’s outburst suggests his views are long held.  Painter drew an analogy to a 2016 rebuke to the Obama Justice Department by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen of Brownsville, Texas who sanctioned DOJ lawyers for allegedly misrepresenting the impact of its policy to defer deportation of certain undocumented immigrants. “All lawyers are expected to describe facts accurately to the court but I believe this obligation is higher when a Justice Department lawyer is explaining what the administration is doing,” Painter said.  Supreme Court litigator Andrew Pincus of Mayer Brown said Painter's theory is  entirely speculative.  Pincus, who was a lawyer in the Clinton administration and has represented amici in challenges to both Trump travel bans, said the Justice Department lawyers who filed the Trump administration's petition for Supreme Court review not only have impeccable records of public service but  almost certainly  did not interact with Trump himself.   These lawyers...had no reason to suspect, much less to know, any reason that the second order, signed by the president, should not be taken at face value,  Pincus said in a response to Painter's comments.  Given the history of last five months, it seems highly likely that the president’s tweets came as a surprise to these lawyers, along with the rest of the country.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 settled up 79 cents at $48.19. It fell in early trade, then bounced off technical support between $48.75 and $46.95 and edged upward. Benchmark Brent crude oil LCOc1 rose 65 cents a barrel to $50.12.

If this area were to break down in the next few days then this would end any bullish hopes in the short-term,  he said.  Oil prices remain about 8 percent lower than before OPEC and its non-OPEC allies said they were extending output cuts until March 2018. The initial six-month deal to curb output had been due to run till the end of this month.  Leading Arab powers including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates cut ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and Iran. Ships coming from or going to Qatar were barred from docking at Fujairah, in the UAE. Surplus oil in many parts of the world and developments with Qatar had traders nervous, even after Kuwait Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq said Qatar remained committed to restricting crude output under an agreement between OPEC and several non-OPEC suppliers. Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader, said he believed there was  a real chance  OPEC solidarity surrounding production cuts might fracture.

For the study, researchers examined data from more than a decade of regular surveys of cognitive abilities and pain levels among 10,065 elderly adults. Participants who reported often suffering from moderate to severe pain in both of the first two surveys experienced a 9.2 percent faster decline in memory over the next 10 years than people who didn’t.  After a decade, this accelerated memory decline was associated with 16 percent higher odds that people would be unable to keep track of their medications and 12 percent greater likelihood that they would struggle to manage their finances, the study found. It was also linked to about 8 percent greater odds of dementia compared to the seniors without persistent pain.  “People with chronic pain tend to perform poorly on cognitive tests, particularly of memory and attention, compared with people who don’t have chronic pain, but we did not know whether that is due to faster cognitive decline or worse cognitive performance overall,” said lead study author Dr. Elizabeth Whitlock of the University of California, San Francisco.   “The current study showed that, at a population level, it is likely that people with pain have a faster rate of cognitive decline over time than people without pain,” Whitlock said by email.  All of the people in the study were living independently in the community, and not in nursing homes or other institutional settings. Half of them were at least 73 years old, and 60 percent were women.  To be included in the analysis, they had to complete surveys in both 1998 and 2000, and they were classified as having persistent pain if they reported moderate to severe pain in both of those surveys.  Based on results from those first two surveys, about 11 percent of the participants had persistent pain at the start of the study. This was associated with worse symptoms of depression and more limitations in activities of daily living, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.  With persistent pain, people also had a 2.2 percent higher absolute risk of dementia by the end of the study.  The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that higher levels of pain directly contribute to a lower levels of cognitive ability over time. Another limitation is that people with persistent pain were more likely to drop out or die during the study period, leaving more survey data on pain-free people by the end of the study, the authors note. Researchers also lacked data on other factors that can influence pain levels and cognitive abilities such as medication use or social interactions. The magnitude of the effect pain had on dementia in the study was also small, and it’s hard to translate these results into specific health decisions individual patients might face, said Dr. Jeffrey M. Burns, co-director of the University of Kansas Alzheimer’s Disease Center in Kansas City. “It is impossible to know causally what is truly driving the decline in memory given the complexity of causes of memory loss in a population of people with chronic pain,” Burns, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Nevertheless, if you have chronic pain, treat it and its root cause to minimize its impact on health and quality of mind,” Burns added.

The OPEC agreement stands and is highly unlikely to change because of tension with Qatar,  said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The Justice Department on Monday charged Reality Leigh Winner, 25, with removing classified material from a government facility in Georgia. It said she was arrested on Saturday. It was one of the first concrete efforts by the administration of President Donald Trump to crack down on leaks to the media. The charges were announced less than an hour after The Intercept published a top-secret document from the NSA that described Russian efforts to launch cyber attacks on at least one U.S. voting software supplier and send  spear-phishing  emails, or targeted emails, that try to trick a recipient into clicking on a malicious link to steal data, to more than 100 local election officials days before the Nov. 8 U.S. election. While the charges do not name the publication, a U.S. official with knowledge of the case said Winner was charged with leaking the NSA report to The Intercept. A second official confirmed The Intercept document was authentic and did not dispute that the charges were directly tied to it. The Justice Department declined to comment on the case beyond its filing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Winner's mother also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Intercept report carried details it said supported the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian intelligence services were seeking to infiltrate state voter registration systems as part of a broader effort to interfere in the election, discredit Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and help the Republican Trump win the election. The new material does not suggest that actual votes were manipulated. Reality Leigh Winner, 25, a federal contractor charged by the U.S. Department of Justice for sending classified material to a news organization, poses in a picture posted to her Instagram account.   Reality Winner/Social Media via REUTERSThe Intercept co-founding editor Glenn Greenwald did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While partially redacted, the NSA document is marked to show it would be up for declassification on May 5, 2042. The indictment against Winner alleges she  printed and improperly removed  classified intelligence reporting that was dated  on or about May 5, 2017.  Classified documents are typically due to be declassified after 25 years under an executive order signed under former President Bill Clinton. Slideshow (6 Images)The NSA opened a facility in Augusta in 2012 at Fort Gordon, a U.S. Army outpost. The FBI and several congressional committees are investigating how Russia interfered in the election and whether associates of President Donald Trump may have colluded with Russian intelligence operatives during the campaign. Trump has dismissed the allegations as  fake news  and sought to focus attention on leaks of information to the media. Winner graduated from basic military training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio in 2011. Investigators determined she was one of only six individuals to print the document in question and that she had exchanged emails with the news outlet, according to the criminal complaint. The complaint said that on Saturday, Winner told an FBI agent she had intentionally printed classified intelligence and mailed it to a news organization while knowing  the contents of the reporting could be used to the injury of the United States and to the advantage of a foreign nation.  U.S. intelligence agencies including the NSA and Central Intelligence Agency have fallen victim to several thefts of classified material in recent years, often at the hands of a federal contractor. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 disclosed secret documents to journalists, including Greenwald, that revealed broad U.S. surveillance programs.

The Arab world's biggest powers cut ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of support for Islamist militants and Iran, reopening a festering wound two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump's demand for Muslim states to fight terrorism.  Isolating Qatar will not resolve any problem,  Erdogan said in a speech following a fast-breaking iftar dinner for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.  We are and we will do everything we can to resolve this crisis.  Erdogan said he has spoken to French President Emmanuel Macron, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, and Jordan's King Abdullah, among others, as part of a diplomatic push toward resolving the rift.  I hope sanctions will be lifted soon,  he said, in comments broadcast live on television. A Turkish presidential source said earlier that Erdogan had also spoken with leaders of Qatar, Russia, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on lowering the tension. After the talks between Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said late on Monday they called for dialogue and compromise. Turkey has good relations with Qatar as well as several of its Gulf Arab neighbours.  Qatar has for years parlayed its enormous gas wealth and media strength into broad influence in the region. But Gulf Arab neighbors and Egypt have long been irked by its support for the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, which they regard as a political enemy.

Nervous investors piled into low-risk bonds and other safe-haven assets on worries linked to Britain's general election, the European Central Bank's policy meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before a Senate panel, all scheduled for Thursday.  I think there's a lot of anxiety ahead of Thursday's events,  said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency analyst at OANDA in Toronto. The dollar was down 0.92 percent against the yen at 109.43 yen, having broken below its 200-day moving average to touch 109.23 yen, its lowest since April 21.  It's safe-haven (demand) as well as the technical break that's driving dollar-yen,  said Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies in New York. Comey, fired by President Donald Trump in May, will be grilled by the Senate Intelligence Committee on whether Trump  tried to get him to back off an investigation of alleged ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia. Worries about the situation have added to market doubts over the Trump administration's ability to deliver a promised boost to growth and recently weighed on the dollar. The greenback could weaken to as low as 106 yen ahead of Thursday's testimony, Esparza said. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was down 0.24 percent at 96.567.     The euro was up 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.1275. The common currency has gained in recent weeks on various factors, including an ebb in French political concerns and upbeat euro zone data. However, complacency that the ECB will be less dovish has left the euro vulnerable to disappointment if the central bank does not satisfy those expectations, analysts said. With two days to go until Britain holds a national election, the pound saw choppy trading as opinion polls have shown that Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labour party has ebbed over the last three weeks. Sterling was down 0.05 percent against the greenback after falling to as low as $1.2873 earlier in the session. Mexico's peso extended gains to a second straight day after the U.S. and Mexican governments reached a new agreement to significantly shift their sugar trade mix.

Valeria Khadija Collina, who is Italian and converted to Islam, spoke in an interview with Italy's L'Espresso news magazine about her son, Youssef Zaghba, 22, one of the perpetrators of the June 3 attack.   When children make mistakes, parents always feel some guilt. But I did my best, and I think he was worn down on the inside,  she said. Collina lives near the northern city of Bologna.  We always kept track of his friends and made sure he didn't fall in with the wrong people. But he had internet and that's where everything comes from,  she said Collina visited her son in London, and  that neighborhood did not make me feel comfortable,  she said.  I was there and didn't like it. He spent his time with the wrong kind of people.  Collina said she had spoken to Italy's anti-terrorism police last year after her son was prevented from traveling to the Middle East, and that they were the ones to told her on Tuesday that her son had been one of the men who carried out the attack.  Zaghba was stopped at the airport in Bologna in 2016 when he was trying to get to Syria via Turkey, city prosecutor Giuseppe Amato told broadcaster Radio24 on Tuesday .  A person going to Turkey with a backpack aroused some suspicion, also because he told the agent who checked him that he wanted to go and be a terrorist, then he corrected himself,  Amato said.   Italian national Youssef Zaghba, 22, identified by Italian and British law enforcement bodies as the the third man shot dead by police officers during the attack on London Bridge and Borough Market is seen in an undated image handed out by the Metropolitan Police, June 6, 2017, Metropolitan Police Handout via REUTERSCollina said her son had been enticed to try to go to Syria by a  fantasy that was transmitted by Internet  in which he thought he could  live according to pure Islam , but that he did not mention wanting to fight there.  Investigators confiscated Zaghba's computer but did not have proof of a crime. They returned the device but pointed him out to London as a possible suspect, Amato said. British police said Zaghba had not been a subject of interest for them or the domestic intelligence agency MI5 before he and two others launched their attack.  Slideshow (2 Images)Collina said she last spoke to her son two days before the attack and that in retrospect she realizes  it was a goodbye call . She also said she agreed with the Muslim religious leaders who refused to recite funeral prayers for the attackers.  I understand and agree with their choice because it is necessary to send a strong political message,  Collina said.  Her son and the two other attackers rammed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge, then ran into the Borough Market area, and slit throats and stabbed people indiscriminately before they were shot and killed by police. Italian media said Zaghba was born in the Moroccan city of Fez in 1995 but had broken off relations with his Moroccan father. He lived in Morocco for much of his life but made short visits to his mother. He spent a total of 10 days in Italy in the past year and a half, the Bologna prosecutor said.  Collina said she would dedicate her life to fighting Islamic State ideology by  teaching real Islam to people and trying to convince families to fill the void that they might find in their children .

Nervous investors piled into low-risk bonds and other safe-haven assets on worries linked to Britain's general election, the European Central Bank's policy meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before a Senate panel, all scheduled for Thursday.  I think there's a lot of anxiety ahead of Thursday's events,  said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency analyst at OANDA in Toronto. The dollar was down 0.92 percent against the yen at 109.43 yen, having broken below its 200-day moving average to touch 109.23 yen, its lowest since April 21.  It's safe-haven (demand) as well as the technical break that's driving dollar-yen,  said Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies in New York. Comey, fired by President Donald Trump in May, will be grilled by the Senate Intelligence Committee on whether Trump  tried to get him to back off an investigation of alleged ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia. Worries about the situation have added to market doubts over the Trump administration's ability to deliver a promised boost to growth and recently weighed on the dollar. The greenback could weaken to as low as 106 yen ahead of Thursday's testimony, Esparza said. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was down 0.24 percent at 96.567.     The euro was up 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.1275. The common currency has gained in recent weeks on various factors, including an ebb in French political concerns and upbeat euro zone data. However, complacency that the ECB will be less dovish has left the euro vulnerable to disappointment if the central bank does not satisfy those expectations, analysts said. With two days to go until Britain holds a national election, the pound saw choppy trading as opinion polls have shown that Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labour party has ebbed over the last three weeks. Sterling was down 0.05 percent against the greenback after falling to as low as $1.2873 earlier in the session. Mexico's peso extended gains to a second straight day after the U.S. and Mexican governments reached a new agreement to significantly shift their sugar trade mix.

Home favorite Kristina 'Kiki' Mladenovic failed to handle the atmosphere, the wind or the rain, as well as Timea Bacsinszky who checked into the semi-finals with a 6-4 6-4 win. Thirteenth-seed Mladenovic had played with tears in her eyes. She left the arena in a similar state. Swiss Bacsinszky was thrilled.  I knew she would be a formidable opponent,  the 30th seed said grinning.  We had everything today: a hurricane, and sand storms, nice weather, and almost snow... it was really complicated to stay focused throughout the day.  I am knackered.  Addressing the disappointed French crowd she said:  I am sorry, thank you for the atmosphere.  She now has time to regroup before meeting 19-year-old Latvian Jelena Ostapenko who ousted Caroline Wozniacki. Mladenovic had high hopes of becoming the first French champion since Mary Pierce in 2000, but never really clicked.  Today I was very, very far from my best tennis and it was still a close two sets, I'd be silly not to be positive about that,  said Mladenovic, who believed her opponent's game was more suited to the tough conditions. Emotional Kiki While not looking especially anxious, 'Kiki' had looked emotional throughout. She dropped serve straight away. The expected sonic wave of support had not yet materialized, although at each change of ends more and more spectators flooded in, sated by their sacred French lunches.  Kiki-Kiki-Kiki  rumbled around the stadium, and the 24-year-old leveled matters up with a break of her own. Eighty kilometer per hour winds gusted through the grounds as both players, skidding through clouds of clay, picked grit out of their eyes. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 6, 2017   France's Kristina Mladenovic during her quarter final match against Switzerland's Timea Bacsinszky   Reuters / Christian HartmannThe conditions were far from perfect. Both players struggled to hold serve but, leading 5-4, Bacsinszky fired down an ace to seal the set against the local favorite. Always rigidly upright, with a clenched right fist to celebrate a point won and a long, blonde, plaited ponytail swinging down her back, there are many similarities between Mladenovic and Pierce, the last home-grown champion. But so too are the hints of the same brittle fragility that occasionally hijacked Pierce's game.  There's no clay left on this court,  a vexed Mladenovic shouted to herself towards the end of that first set. Bacsinszky simply got on with business, cracking groundstrokes from side to side. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 6, 2017   France's Kristina Mladenovic after losing her quarter final match against Switzerland's Timea Bacsinszky   Reuters / Benoit TessierThe pair held serve to open the second set and, with Mladenovic facing a break point in the third game, the players were called off court after the dark grey clouds finally broke and heavy rain swept the stadium. Bacsinszky Breaks It was more than three hours before play could resume, and, when it did, Mladenovic fought off that break point to nose into the lead, then broke herself for a 3-1 advantage. Once more that  Kiki-Kiki-Kiki  chant was the soundtrack to Court Philippe-Chatrier, but it was a short-lived affair, with Bacsinszky breaking twice either side of a held service game, to be leading 4-3 and serving. Mladenovic was playing with tears in her eyes. The Frenchwoman won the first point of the game, but the pair were then called off court again as the skies darkened. Mladenovic slammed her racket into her bag and left the arena as the rain started spitting, and groundsmen hauled the big, orange tarpaulin across the court. They returned about half an hour later. A backhand bunted wide gave Bacsinszky a 5-3 lead, and forced Mladenovic to serve to stay in the hunt. She held to force Bacsinszky to serve it out, and the Swiss was equal to the task, ensuring she gets to play in the semi-finals on her birthday. Quirkily enough, while Bacsinszky turns 28 on Thursday, her opponent Ostapenko will be 20 the same day. Two birthdays, one present -- someone will be crying into their cake.

Chile, one of Latin America's most developed countries, is relatively well connected in telecoms terms, but existing networks will not suffice for the future, telecoms undersecretary Rodrigo Ramirez said to journalists. The domestic project will connect the settlements of remote Patagonia as far south as Puerto Williams on the tip of Cape Horn, and would be the world's most southerly such cable, the telecoms ministry said. The contract to build it is to be awarded in September and will be subsidized to the tune of 64 billion Chilean pesos ($96 million). International companies had expressed an interest in the growth of technology infrastructure in the region, including Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, said Ramirez. Amazon is expanding its cloud business internationally and is keen to build more data centers. In March, the company signed an understanding with Chile to help modernize the country's government systems. It has also expressed an interest in placing a data center in Patagonia, ministry technical head Sebastian Beeche told Reuters. Beeche added that President Michelle Bachelet would discuss this with company representatives during a visit to Seattle in the United States on Tuesday where Amazon has its headquarters. In South America, Amazon has data centers only in Brazil, but is keen to expand into Chile, attracted by its relative economic and political stability and the cooler climate, said Beeche. The company's cloud-computing business is the largest in the world and accounts for a majority of its operating profit. Adding more data centers is key so it can handle an influx of new clients looking to host their data and computing in the cloud.  Amazon did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Transpacific Cables Chile has also been talking with China about laying fiber optic cable across the Pacific, a technically demanding challenge, said Ramirez. Such a cable would cost an estimated $550 million to $650 million and stretch for at least 20,000 kilometers (12,427 miles) across the southern Pacific, an area that to date is off the international subsea fiber optic grid. Three potential routes are being examined, the ministry said. One would run from Chile's coast via New Zealand and Australia, another further south via just New Zealand, and a third via Tahiti. All could potentially link remote Easter Island, which is governed by Chile. The timing of construction of the trans-Pacific route and the details of the bidding process have not yet been finalized, but the government said it was hoping to make a decision this year on the route and was in discussions with China, and also with other South American countries that may benefit.

Nervous investors piled into low-risk bonds and other safe-haven assets on worries linked to Britain's general election, the European Central Bank's policy meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before a Senate panel, all scheduled for Thursday.  I think there's a lot of anxiety ahead of Thursday's events,  said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency analyst at OANDA in Toronto. The dollar was down 0.92 percent against the yen at 109.43 yen, having broken below its 200-day moving average to touch 109.23 yen, its lowest since April 21.  It's safe-haven (demand) as well as the technical break that's driving dollar-yen,  said Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies in New York. Comey, fired by President Donald Trump in May, will be grilled by the Senate Intelligence Committee on whether Trump  tried to get him to back off an investigation of alleged ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia. Worries about the situation have added to market doubts over the Trump administration's ability to deliver a promised boost to growth and recently weighed on the dollar. The greenback could weaken to as low as 106 yen ahead of Thursday's testimony, Esparza said. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was down 0.24 percent at 96.567.     The euro was up 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.1275. The common currency has gained in recent weeks on various factors, including an ebb in French political concerns and upbeat euro zone data. However, complacency that the ECB will be less dovish has left the euro vulnerable to disappointment if the central bank does not satisfy those expectations, analysts said. With two days to go until Britain holds a national election, the pound saw choppy trading as opinion polls have shown that Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labour party has ebbed over the last three weeks. Sterling was down 0.05 percent against the greenback after falling to as low as $1.2873 earlier in the session. Mexico's peso extended gains to a second straight day after the U.S. and Mexican governments reached a new agreement to significantly shift their sugar trade mix.

With 22-times grand slam champion Serena Williams out of the equation, you could have stuck a pin in the women's draw to pick a winner at Roland Garros this year, such is the lack of a consistently reliable leading bunch. None of this year's eight quarter-finalists were grand slam champions and 19-year-old Jelena Ostapenko on Tuesday reached the semi-finals in only her second main draw appearance in Paris. She will face 30th seed Timea Bacsinszky in the semis while the other half at least still includes second seed Karolina Pliskova and third seed Simona Halep. Seven of the eight top men's seeds reached the quarters compared to three in the women's. While the open-nature of the women's tournament has created interest, Wilander says longer matches would create a situation more similar to the men's with regular grand slam match-ups between the world's top players.  You would get the cream to the top more of the time,  Wilander told Reuters.  They are physically strong enough to play five sets and I guess it's just more about is the demand there from the TV and the crowds?  Physically, tactically, emotionally, three out of five separates the great players from the good players.  Maybe they should do a survey with fans and sponsors and TV viewers to ask if they go to three out of five in slams.  I think the three out of five format makes a massive difference for the better players to have the chance to be down a set and a break and not panic and come back. I think (three out of five) is definitely something to put out there.  While Wilander, in Paris as a presenter of Eurosport's daily flagship show 'Game, Set and Mats', said the women's tournament is wide open he cannot look past Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Stan Wawrinka or Andy Murray in the men's.  You can't think that (Kei) Nishikori, Dominic Thiem or Marin Cilic have a chance,  he said.  Yes they could beat one of the top guys but it's ridiculously tough to then come back and do it again. Emotionally more than physically.  Even defending champion Djokovic, Wawrinka and Murray would have to play the  game of their lives  to beat Nadal who has leaked only 20 games so far, according to the Swede.  I think this is the best I've seen him in the first week of the French Open,  Wilander said.  He got rejuvenated from last year when he couldn't play. Now he has that passion and is loving being out there.  Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Toby Davis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-frenchopen-wilander-idUSKBN18X2OH"},

DeVos, a Republican who narrowly won Senate approval for her post in February after strident opposition from Democrats and a few fellow party members, testified before the Senate appropriations subcommittee on education about the proposed budget Trump submitted to Congress last month. Trump's plan to cut $9 billion from the Education Department's budget would  improve educational opportunities  and shift the federal role in education, DeVos told the panel.  I understand those figures are alarming for many,  she said.  However, this budget refocuses the department on supporting states and school districts in their efforts to provide high-quality education to all our students.  Democrats took turns asking DeVos about the bigger budget line-items and talking about students who they say could be hurt by large spending cuts. The most pointed exchanges were on whether private schools that receive federal funds would have to agree not to discriminate against students. DeVos would only repeat that schools taking federal money must abide by U.S. law. But Senator Jeff Merkley and his fellow Democrats said she was refusing to answer the question because federal law is unclear in many areas of possible discrimination, such as the rights of transgendered people. U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testifies before the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

The subcommittee's chair, conservative Republican Roy Blunt, said he believed Congress would not approve the budget as proposed. U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testifies before the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. June 6, 2017.Aaron P. Bernstein Such a significant cut to the department’s budget is likely untenable,  Blunt said, pressing specifically to preserve funds for technical programs, work-study financial aid and the Special Olympics. Civil rights groups and Democrats say the budget would send public dollars to private companies, disband after-school care, hurt schools in poor neighborhoods, shrink the ranks of teachers, and make it harder for many to afford college.  DeVos is currently working on major transformations in student loans. The budget suggests changing income-based repayment plans and ending loan forgiveness for workers in the public sector, which DeVos said would clear up confusion around the loans. With the stated aim of giving parents more choices for their children's education, DeVos and Republicans support charter schools, which are publicly funded but operate independently, frequently by corporations, as well as subsidies to help pay private-school tuition. Many Republicans on the panel applauded the budget's proposal to boost such  school choice  programs. But the subcommittee's senior Democrat, Patty Murray, said the cuts  highlight the ways that the policies and priorities you and President Trump are pushing would hurt students, hurt communities, and represent a clear broken promise to workers and the middle class.

Chile, one of Latin America's most developed countries, is relatively well connected in telecoms terms, but existing networks will not suffice for the future, telecoms undersecretary Rodrigo Ramirez said to journalists. The domestic project will connect the settlements of remote Patagonia as far south as Puerto Williams on the tip of Cape Horn, and would be the world's most southerly such cable, the telecoms ministry said. The contract to build it is to be awarded in September and will be subsidized to the tune of 64 billion Chilean pesos ($96 million). International companies had expressed an interest in the growth of technology infrastructure in the region, including Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, said Ramirez. Amazon is expanding its cloud business internationally and is keen to build more data centers. In March, the company signed an understanding with Chile to help modernize the country's government systems. It has also expressed an interest in placing a data center in Patagonia, ministry technical head Sebastian Beeche told Reuters. Beeche added that President Michelle Bachelet would discuss this with company representatives during a visit to Seattle in the United States on Tuesday where Amazon has its headquarters. In South America, Amazon has data centers only in Brazil, but is keen to expand into Chile, attracted by its relative economic and political stability and the cooler climate, said Beeche. The company's cloud-computing business is the largest in the world and accounts for a majority of its operating profit. Adding more data centers is key so it can handle an influx of new clients looking to host their data and computing in the cloud.  Amazon did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Transpacific Cables Chile has also been talking with China about laying fiber optic cable across the Pacific, a technically demanding challenge, said Ramirez. Such a cable would cost an estimated $550 million to $650 million and stretch for at least 20,000 kilometers (12,427 miles) across the southern Pacific, an area that to date is off the international subsea fiber optic grid. Three potential routes are being examined, the ministry said. One would run from Chile's coast via New Zealand and Australia, another further south via just New Zealand, and a third via Tahiti. All could potentially link remote Easter Island, which is governed by Chile.

The effort seeks to enhance the agency's oversight of commodity and derivatives markets, but also to make compliance and regulatory reporting more effective for the industry participants. The Lab, launched last month by Acting Chairman Christopher Giancarlo, is open for business, with headquarters in New York City, and a core team of three who are already receiving inquiries from technology firms in the U.S. and abroad.  “We’ve had inbound communications from New York, around the country, and around the world,” Jeffrey Bandman, Fintech Advisor for the CFTC, told Regulatory Intelligence in an interview last week. In a surprise announcement on Monday, Bandman said he was stepping down from his role as fintech advisor to take a position in the private sector. “We’ve had interest from innovators who want to learn more about the lab and who have technology they want to show us, as well as from those who want to understand more about how the program functions,” said Bandman.  He said the CFTC’s focus for the effort would be on better understanding physical markets, real-time surveillance, and reporting. While the New York-based Lab is the main conduit for the agency’s outreach to the fintech and regtech world, Bandman said the resources and expertise across the agency would be involved in future projects with promising potential for the regulator. “While we made New York the focal point it’s very important that from the outset there is engagement by the staff, a larger group of contributors in all offices of the CFTC that reflects different subject matter expertise,” he said. “What I would hope is that through LabCFTC we can learn more about the capabilities of emerging tech to help us,” he added.  u.s. Regulators Take Different Approaches The CFTC’s effort comes against an uneven regulatory landscape with regard to fintech firms and how to engage them. On the banking side the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has established its own “Office of Innovation.” While the office will not provide the sort of “fintech sandbox” seen in the UK and other countries that allows banks and fintech firms to develop products without fear of running afoul of regulators, it will allow the OCC and the banks to experiment with new technology before it hits the market.  In addition, the bank regulator late last year announced a “special purpose” banking charter for fintech firms(here), an effort that has been applauded in some quarters while sharply criticized in others, particularly from U.S. state banking regulators who see the OCC charter as a threat to their authority while also making the regulatory requirements for fintech startups more complex and costly. Federal Reserve officials, meanwhile, have been relatively cautious. Fed governor Laurel Brainard, said in a recent speech(here) that the OCC's fintech charter proposal “raises interpretive and policy issues for the Federal Reserve regarding whether charter recipients would become Federal Reserve members” or have access to the Fed’s accounts and services, such as direct access to payment systems. More broadly, Brainard said “it is still too early to have any confidence that we know which fintech innovations will prove to be the most long-lasting or widely adopted.” On the securities side, the Securities and Exchange Commission has also treaded gingerly. Late last year the agency held its first “fintech forum,” bringing together experts from the field and internally to discuss disruptive technologies such as blockchain. It has also established a “Distributed Technology Working Group” to build expertise and identify so-called risk areas. But since then there has not been much public activity by the regulator. Cftc’S Focus: Physical Markets, Surveillance & Reporting Where could the agency benefit from innovation? Bandman outlined three broad areas where he saw scope for applying new technologies: physical commodities markets, market surveillance and regulatory reporting. For physical markets, where there is little if any regulatory oversight, applying technologies such as satellite imaging and sensors might give the agency a better view over possible market supply conditions in the roughly 40 commodities they oversee, such as oil, wheat and soybeans, in financial derivatives. “Our ability to understand the underlying physical commodity markets could be transformational,” said Bandman. “There is a mix of technologies that is providing information on physical commodity markets, including satellite data and sensors.” Having a better handle on conditions in the physical markets could serve a twofold purpose: spotting possible systemic market development that would lead to greater risk, as well identifying activities by market participants that involve manipulation. “If a Texas farmer can harvest a field of wheat in the pitch black of night using GPS satellite navigation, vehicle telemetry and aerial drone technology, surely it is high time for the CFTC to take a its own steps toward digital transformation” Giancarlo said in an emailed comment from the agency to Regulatory Intelligence. “We want LabCFTC to bridge the gap from where we are today to where we need to be – a 21st century regulator for 21st century digital markets.” Bandman added: “One of our missions is to ensure market integrity. As we’ve seen there can be activity in the physical market where the payoff is in the derivatives market or vice versa. . . In terms of accomplishing that mission this is one area where there is tremendous potential.” Potential of ‘Blockchain’ The frenzy to apply distributed ledger technology (DLT), or blockchain, in various parts of the financial services offers transformational opportunities in two other areas of regulatory oversight -- market surveillance and regulatory reporting. Bandman sees DLT potentially providing a real-time insight into financial derivatives markets such as swaps that allow for greater detection and surveillance of fraudulent activities, as well identification of the build-up of imbalances that might pose systemic risk. “There is a lot of activity in the U.S. and around the world by innovators, academic institutions and researchers who are looking at transactions as they occur in real-time and putting the transactional information on the blockchain,” said Bandman, who cautioned that the work was more “potential” at the moment than real. “The ability to see intra-day or real-time risks as they unfold in real-time would be transformational,” he said. A critical part of reaching such a state would be ensuring the quality of the underlying transactional data, a so-called “golden copy,” that would be used by regulators in monitoring risks in the marketplace. But the benefits would accrue not only to regulators.  “If the data the regulator is relying on is the same as the industry is also using…then there are clear benefits for the registrants,” Bandman said. “Because that’s the data they are using in their business processes and they will be making sure that data is correct.” “I think it has real potential to help everyone,” he added. “I don’t think we’re there tomorrow, but it is a transformational opportunity.” (Henry Engler is a North American Regulatory Intelligence Editor for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.

Prime Minister Theresa May called Trump's comments  wrong.  Trump has lambasted Khan on Twitter, accusing him of making a  pathetic excuse,  for saying Londoners should not be alarmed by the sight of additional police on the streets of the British capital after Saturday's attack that killed seven people.  The invitation has been issued and accepted and I see no reason to change that, but as far as what Sadiq Khan has said about the reassurances he's offered the people of London, I think he was entirely right to speak in the way he did,  Johnson said in a BBC radio interview when asked whether Trump's state visit should be canceled. No date has been set for the visit, which was agreed during May's visit to Washington in January and seen as a sign of her desire to maintain good ties with Britain's traditional close ally as Trump began his presidency. The Conservative prime minister has said Khan is doing a good job, echoing public sentiment across London. On Tuesday, May told a political rally in response to a question about Trump's tweets,  I think Donald Trump was wrong in the things that he has said about Sadiq Khan.   Trump and Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants and the first Muslim elected as London's mayor, have been at odds since Khan denounced as  ignorant  Trump's campaign pledge to impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has ordered temporary travel restrictions on people from several Muslim-majority countries, although the ban is currently held up by federal courts. Asked on Tuesday about the London visit, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said only that Trump intended to go and that  he appreciates her majesty's gracious invitation.  Asked on Monday evening if he would like Trump's visit to be called off, Khan, a member of Britain's opposition Labour party, said his position remained the same.  I don't think we should roll out the red carpet to the president of the USA in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for,  Khan told Channel 4 News. 'Trash Talk' Tim Farron, leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats, also has urged May to cancel the visit, saying Trump was insulting Britain's values  at a time of introspection and mourning.  Former Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, defeated by Trump last November, praised Khan's performance in dealing with the attacks.  Speaking at a fundraising event on Monday, she did not name Trump but said it was  not the time to lash out, to incite fear and use trash talk and terror for political gain,  the Washington Examiner reported. Deputy White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Monday that she did not think it was correct to characterize Trump's tweets as  picking a fight  with Khan.  Asked if Trump was attacking the mayor because he is Muslim, Sanders replied:  Not at all. And I think to suggest something like that is utterly ridiculous.  Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., defended his father.  Every time he puts something out there he gets criticized by the media. All day, every day,  Trump Jr. said in an interview with ABC's  Good Morning America  broadcast on Tuesday.    And guess what, he's been proven right about it, every time. We keep saying, 'It's going to be great' and 'Hold fast,' 'We're going to keep calm and carry on.' Maybe we have to keep calm and actually do something,  he said. He was referring to a World War Two-era slogan of resilience, to  keep calm and carry on , that Britons have echoed following the London attack. British author J.K. Rowling said on Tuesday that if a state visit did go ahead, Trump's tweets related to the attack should be enlarged and shown wherever he goes.  I'd rather he didn't come, but if he does, I'd like his vile Tweets juxtaposed against whatever he's been coaxed to read off an autocue,  Rowling, celebrated for her Harry Potter books and a frequent critic of Trump, wrote on Twitter.

Data released on Tuesday by the U.S. Travel Association (USTA), in partnership with Oxford Economics, showed stronger-than-expected April demand despite the initial messy rollout of President Donald Trump's order in January barring travel to the United States from several Muslim majority countries. That order has been stayed by a number of federal courts, and is now awaiting a review by the U.S. Supreme Court.  April is the first month when data on international travel would reliably reflect the impact of the controversy over Trump's order, the U.S. Travel Association said.  There have been many claims that the administration's actions on travel have tarnished America's brand abroad, but we're seeing hard economic evidence of the U.S. travel sector's remarkable resilience,  USTA Chief Executive Officer Roger Dow said in a statement. However, the full report cautioned that international travel to the United States in April grew at  a slower pace than the six-month moving average  and may have been helped by holiday travel.  Looking ahead, a variety of factors, including the strength of the U.S. dollar, a fragile global economy and a turbulent political environment are expected to negatively impact international inbound travel.

{"news_time":"2017-06-06 15:55:00","news_title":"COMMENTARY: A kinder, gentler arbitration process for U.S. financial consumers","keywords":"Lawrence Hsieh,Richard Cordray,BC,FINREG,ARBITRATION,ALTERNATIVES","sector":"Subjects","content":"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - For Richard Cordray, the Obama-administration appointee who still leads the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Wells Fargo bogus account fiasco is the public relations gift that keeps on giving.  Wells Fargo's customers had tried to  have their day in court  and sue over the bank's opening of fake accounts in their names. The bank, however, invoked mandatory arbitration provisions in the contracts that the customers assented to when they opened real accounts. Mandatory arbitration provisions in consumer contracts require aggrieved customers to waive their rights to pursue class action claims and instead to resolve their disputes through individual arbitration, which many consumers perceive as biased in favor of companies. The scandal would appear to give Cordray the momentum to formally issue a controversial rule proposed by the CFPB in May, 2016 to ban class action waivers in consumer financial services contracts. Republicans in Congress who oppose the rule, however, have the simple majority needed to reverse any ban under the Congressional Review Act, which would then preclude the CFPB from issuing substantially similar regulations without new statutory support. Also, recent Supreme Court rulings give great deference to the Federal Arbitration Act, which provides companies wide latitude to structure mandatory arbitration provisions that prevent consumers from pursuing class action litigation. Given the obstacles, reforming the consumer arbitration process itself might be a more productive way for the director to spend the rest of his term, which expires in mid-2018 under the agency's politically disputed structure, than by pushing through a final CFPB rule that bans the waivers. One path to reform is to work with banks to voluntarily remake arbitration with some of the features that consumers seem to like about litigation, but without sacrificing factors that make arbitration generally less expensive and time consuming.  Open Arbitration The proposed CFPB rule aims to give the agency the power to collect and publish certain records relating to arbitral proceedings to allow the agency to take action if the records warrant. A more transparent approach, however, might be to eliminate the CFPB filter and make consumer arbitration open to the public, no more or less open than civil litigation. In the Wells Fargo case, the abuses did not come to public light until many years after the problems started. Public arbitration would shine a light on problems before they spread. A public forum would allow arbitrators to decide cases in plain sight, but without sacrificing the speed that has become a hallmark of the procedure. Like private arbitration, public arbitration would be conducted without the drawn-out tangle of legal motions or the requirement to follow the rigid rules of civil procedure. Public arbitration would also facilitate fastidious record-keeping that would support additional reforms. Consumer Choice in Arbitrator Pool A second reform addresses the perceived bias of arbitrators in favor of banks. Business-to-business contracts frequently allow each side of the dispute to select an arbitrator from the specified pool. Alternative Dispute Resolution providers like the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and JAMS can do more to recruit arbitrators with a more consumerist bent, but giving consumers more flexibility in choosing an arbitrator from the current pool might make arbitration more palatable. Appeals A third reform aims to mitigate the psychological impact of finality. It would allow consumers to appeal an arbitration decision to a panel of arbitrators. The grounds for judicial review under federal and state law are very narrow. A court cannot vacate an arbitration decision based on the merits of the decision; it can only vacate if the decision results from egregious arbitrator conduct.  Regulators lack the power to force banks to submit to appellate review, but banks could voluntarily agree to submit to non-judicial appellate review under rules similar to the ones that arbitration providers already have in place to give companies peace of mind in business-to-business transactions.  For example, AAA and JAMS rules allow the appeal of arbitration decisions by either party to an appellate arbitral panel that would apply a standard of review similar to the standard that appellate courts apply when reviewing lower court decisions. And the arbitral appellate process doesn't have to be slow; the rules aim to complete appeals within a couple of months.  Uncertain Outcomes and Unintended Consequences There is of course no guarantee that any of these proposals will improve outcomes for consumers. Any solution meant to solve a problem can be gamed. For example, another solution would allow banks to arbitrate, but only up to a specified number of cases or dollar threshold. After that, claimants would be free to pursue class action litigation or class action arbitration. Banks, however, could creatively classify the cases in a way that works to keep the cases out of court for as long as possible. There might also be unintended consequences to these proposals. For example, banks might reprice their services to offset an increased cost of compliance. This might open up opportunities for non-banks to offer similar services with less oversight from regulators. Compromise In November, 2016, several banks proposed a compromise with the CFPB that would allow arbitration requirements to remain in place when regulators have intervened regarding the conduct in question, or the company has notified regulators and pursued voluntary corrective action. The premise is that in such cases, the presumed function of class-action suits as a backstop for protecting consumer rights is not needed.  In their proposal, the banks have shown willingness to compromise, even if only to preempt unilateral CFPB action. Therefore, banks also realize that the current situation is as bad for banks and their shareholders, as it is for consumers. This is a great chance for bureaucrats and politicians on both sides of the aisle to offer solutions that show that they mean business when they say they want to fight for their constituents. --Proposed rule to ban class action waivers: here (Lawrence Hsieh is a senior legal editor for the Practical Law division of Thomson Reuters and author of the Corporate Transactions Handbook.

In both its governance structure and substance, the (Cooperative Capital Markets Regulator) CCMR is not in the interests of investors,  the Canadian Foundation for Advancement of Investor Rights (FAIR) said in a May white paper.  The CCMR was meant to consolidate Canada's 13 independent securities regulators into one national authority. Six provinces have joined so far, including Ontario and British Columbia. Alberta and Quebec lead opposition to the plan, citing sovereignty concerns. The new cooperative system's design reflects years of negotiation and compromise.  It does not contemplate the creation of an investor office or investor advisory panel, and no investor representative sits on the board of directors,  FAIR noted.  In terms of substantive law, the contemplated legal regime does not contain a statutory best interest duty, a prohibition on embedded commissions, or a regime with financial incentives for whistleblowers.  The paper's author, Anita Anand, stressed to Regulatory Intelligence that she strongly supports a centralised securities regulator in Canada, but insisted that investors were being forgotten in the transition.   When I consider this particular proposal, in terms of the mandate of securities regulation, I must conclude that the current [proposed] model is relatively disadvantageous to investor interests,  Anand said.  There is time for reform before this model is finalised so that it is acceptable from an investor protection standpoint.  Federal and provincial officials defended their commitment to investor protection in written statements to Regulatory Intelligence.  A Step Backward for Canada's Largest Capital Market?  FAIR's criticism is especially relevant for investors and regulators in Ontario, which is home to Canada's largest and most important capital markets, including the TSX. The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has launched multiple investor protection initiatives (e.g. a whistleblower program, investor advisory panel, and promotion of a best-interest duty) that are not reflected in the current design of the regulatory system that would replace it.   it makes little sense to exchange an investor-focused securities regulator (OSC) for one that institutionalizes a governance structure in which investor representation is effectively nil,  the white paper said.  An OSC official declined to comment on the merits of the incoming system, but noted:  Between now and implementation, our focus is on regulating Ontario's capital markets with the best interests of investors and market participants in mind .  A spokesperson for Ontario's Ministry of Finance stressed that  many elements  of the Ontario investor protection framework were incorporated in the new regulator's proposed design.  These are improvements to the current system for investors,  the official said, citing  significant new enforcement powers,  such as court-enforceable production orders and new securities-specific criminal offences. No Best Interest Standard or Embedded Commission Ban Current proposals underpinning the incoming regulatory system do not include the adoption of best interest standards or the prohibition of embedded commissions, which are significant regulatory initiatives now under consideration in Canada, FAIR noted.  There is no assurance that they will be carried forward under the CCMR or in its substantive legislation,  FAIR added.  Investors may not be as well protected in the new regime.  FAIR cautioned that omitting a best interest standard could delay it for years, or even prevent it altogether. A 2015 CCMR Consultation Draft Summary noted that the best interest standard was  outside the scope  of the new system's legislative component, but would fit  within the [incoming regulator's] regulation-making authority . Provinces are currently far from any consensus on the issue, however, with only Ontario and New Brunswick supporting a statutory approach. Other jurisdictions prefer targeted regulations to achieve a similar result.  On embedded commissions, Canadian regulators have recently proposed abolishing the practice(here), citing conflicts of interest, investor confusion over costs, and non-alignment with investor services.  We are concerned that if the CMRA does not carry forward the content and proposals of the [embedded commission] consultation, that the useful steps that have been taken from a policy standpoint will be in vain,  FAIR said.   This is a very important issue,  Anand said separately.  There is an expectations gap in our capital markets, between what retail investors are paying for and what they're getting, and there's a huge ignorance factor, and that has to stop.  A federal Ministry of Finance official stressed that if provinces all agreed to enact the two proposals prior to launch, they  would be carried forward  into the new system.  Elements of the investor protection and enforcement framework of the cooperative regulator are still being developed,  the official said.  Final details will be provided in the regulations or as part of policy initiatives undertaken by the cooperative regulator.  No Investor Representation Unlike the OSC, which in 2010 created the Investor Advisory Panel (IAP) to inject investor voices into its policy-making process, the CCMR features no such body. Additionally, the new regulator's initial board of directors(here) is populated largely by investment industry executives and lawyers.   The CCMR has no investor representation built into its structure, as a means to be responsive to investor concerns,  the FAIR whitepaper noted, calling it a  striking omission . In response, the federal finance official noted that CCMR board members were  recommended by a nominating committee and are not meant to be representative of a particular stakeholder group .  Additionally, in response to consultation commentary on the 2014 draft Capital Markets Act, participating jurisdictions said they would  continue to discuss the possibility  of establishing an IAP. FAIR also urged participating governments to include a statutory (i.e. legally binding) investor advisory panel in the draft legislation.  An IAP should not be formed by a policy statement or decision of the board that can easily be reversed,  it said.  Rather, as with the U.K. Financial Services Advisory Panel, it should be a creature of statute with both the funding and a mandate to represent the interests of retail investors in Canadian capital markets.  No Whistleblower Framework or Incentives While the proposed regulatory system contains anti-retaliation provisions to deter employers from punishing whistleblowers, it does not include financial compensation for informants. It also lacks a specific policy framework that codifies informant protections and other incentives.  The [proposed] regime is less friendly to potential and actual whistleblowers than the current OSC regime,  FAIR said.  In 2016, the OSC launched Canada's only whistleblower program with financial rewards for informants that proactively disclose serious offences. Under the program, eligible informants can receive awards up to C$5 million.  Its policy recognizes that monetary awards are an integral component of an effective whistleblowing regime,  the white paper said.  Politics Anand pointed to Canada's fractious federal system to explain why investor interests seemed to lose priority in the transition to a national regulator.   This is Canada,  Anand said.  We've got Quebec and Alberta who aren't joining at all. We've got Ontario and British Columbia, who took the lead on [CCMR], but now they disagree about best-interest rules. We've got some provinces waiting to find out what will happen with the regulations before they endorse [an approach to] best interests.   When you look at all of this, it is the result of political power plays, and that to me is unacceptable when we're talking about the regulation of capital markets,  Anand added.  I would urge every province around the table to reconsider its stance on what is in investors' interests when they are discussing the new regulations.  --Canadian Foundation for Advancement of Investor Rights (FAIR) whitepaper: here --CCMR Consultation Draft Summary: here --Response to Consultation commentary:here --Investor Advisory Panel:here --OSC whistleblower program:here (Daniel Seleanu is a correspondent for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence in Toronto.

Bankruptcy court may be the wrong place for banks to meet their maker, the former Federal Reserve chairman said on Tuesday at the Brookings Institution in Washington. A chaotic failure on Wall Street would be just too damaging and so regulators should have another option ready.  Under circumstances like we had in 2008 I really don't see (bankruptcy) as being realistic,  Bernanke said.  Bernanke ran the central bank during the 2008 meltdown and constructed emergency rescue plans for the financial system alongside Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and then-New York Fed President Timothy Geithner. Financial reforms put in place since then have granted regulators so-called  Orderly Liquidation Authority  allowing them to seize a teetering bank and execute a living will put together by the bank. Big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) have been submitting resolution plans for approval and incorporating feedback from regulators for years. However, a new reform plan backed by Republican lawmakers would erase some of those provisions. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, who is leading the effort, has said bankruptcy court is a better option because it eliminates the risk that taxpayers would have to bail out a failing institution. During the 2008 crisis, the federal government injected hundreds of billions of dollars into big banks, insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N), mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and automakers, whose financing arms were in trouble. The Fed also invented multitrillion-dollar liquidity programs and set interest rates to zero to stabilize financial markets. Much of the mayhem erupted after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008. Stock markets swung dramatically in the following weeks as investors worried regulators would not be able to save the system from collapse. Lehman’s bankruptcy has been playing out in court for years. Given that experience, Bernanke said his successors will need  weekend-type speed.   The bankruptcy system,  he said,  has no need for speed.

A rally in cryptocurrency Ethereum has boosted demand for graphics chips used by people to  mine  it and other digital currencies, with some of AMD's processors sold out on Amazon.com and other retail websites. Mining for cryptocurrency involves using networks of computers to validate transactions and prevent counterfeit by solving complex mathematical problems. New currency is generated as a reward to the computer operators. The emergence of Bitcoin in 2009 made cryptocurrency mining popular. Recent rallies in the price of Bitcoin and newer digital currency Ethereum have rekindled interest. Ethereum miners spending as little as $2,000 to build mining computers using graphics processing units, or GPUs, from AMD or its rival Nvidia could break even within three or four months, estimated RBC analyst Mitch Steves in a note to clients on Tuesday.  We think economics suggests that GPUs continue to be sold out,  Steves wrote.  We think GPU demand will remain robust as long as the return is under (about) one year.  As of Monday, AMD short sellers had been up about $15 million for 2017. But Tuesday’s share surge left them at a loss of $125 million on paper for the year, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. That follows losses of over $700 million for AMD short sellers last year, when the stock tripled. The stock last traded up 7.3 percent at $12.06.  There are going to be a lot of traders saying, 'This is the last straw. I'm out,'  said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3's managing director of research. AMD spokesman Drew Prairie acknowledged that interest from cryptocurrency miners was contributing to demand for the company's chips, but he stressed that game enthusiasts are the core market. JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft Corp, Intel Corp and more than two dozen other companies have teamed up to develop standards to make it easier for enterprises to use technology related to Ethereum. Adding to support for AMD's stock, Apple on Monday refreshed its lineup of Mac personal computers, including upgraded graphics chips from AMD.

With Temer's future on the line because of an ongoing corruption investigation and an electoral fraud trial that begins later Tuesday, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) is considering leaving the cabinet and quitting the coalition whatever the outcome.     The breakaway movement is led by a group of young PSDB lawmakers in the lower house, known as  the black heads  for the color of their hair, not yet gray from age. They fear corruption accusations against Temer and his Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) could further tarnish their own party that is already beset by scandals involving its own leaders.  Temer, who is accused of receiving millions in bribes from giant meatpacker JBS SA, has won time from PSDB elders in the Senate, as they have not found a consensus figure to replace Temer should he be pushed from office and with Brazil's long-suffering economy showing signs of life.  Both younger and older PSDB members, however, agree the party must support Temer's labor and pension reforms to consolidate an economic recovery crucial for their ambitions of returning to the presidency after a 16-year dry spell.     According to PSDB Senator Ricardo Ferraco, an influential politician in charge of drafting the labor reform, some of the party elders are changing their minds and considering a breakup.   Temer put a good government plan in place, but we cannot ignore the corruption allegations,  said Ferraco, 53, from his Senate office overlooking the futuristic capital.  We are convinced the reforms need to continue whoever is the president.   The party is split on whether it should wait to leave Temer's coalition until the electoral court decides whether or not to unseat him for alleged use of illegal funds to finance his 2014 election campaign when he ran as Dilma Rousseff's running mate.  Ferraco said the party should break away this week even before the court reaches a decision, which could take weeks or months.  Another party leader and member of its executive board, Jose Anibal, called for caution and said the party should not leave the coalition without a final decision from the court.   A big majority doesn't want to backtrack on what we have gained so far. We cannot lose those economic gains,  Anibal said.  With three ministers in the cabinet and the third largest representation in Congress, a PSDB break could precipitate the fall of Temer, just one year after the impeachment of Rousseff, whose leftist Workers Party ruled the country for 13 years.   Temer's demise could put an end to his reform agenda to cap surging pension expenditures and close a widening fiscal deficit that cost Brazil its investment grade credit rating.   The PSDB, created by breakaway leftist dissidents from Temer's PMDB after the end of Brazil's 21-year dictatorship, was credited with defeating years-long hyperinflation and recession during its rule between 1995-2002.   For the first time in years, the PSDB has a clear shot at winning the presidency in 2018 after grave corruption allegations have weakened its arch rival the Workers' Party. Lawmakers said that Geraldo Alckmin, the governor of the country's most populous state, Sao Paulo, could be the PSDB candidate for 2018. Alckmin's main ally and mayor of the city of Sao Paulo, Joao Doria, is also a possible contender.    The PSDB, however, is also reeling from corruption accusations against its leaders, including 2014 presidential candidate Aecio Neves.  For first-time PSDB congressman Betinho Gomes, the party should renew itself by distancing itself from corruption allegations now.       We don't want to boycott Brazil or the government, but our electorate is demanding answers,  Gomes said.  We should go our separate way, but remain committed with the reforms.

Ten-year Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, currently sit at 2.141 percent. A close at or below that yield could test the psychological 2.0 percent level, said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago.  We have a situation here where technicals are informing the direction of Treasuries, with the various risk events adding to the momentum,  said Brien. In the British election, a tightening race between the ruling Conservative Party over the opposition Labor Party, based on recent polls, raised uncertainty about Britain's path in its exit from the European Union. Traders have also speculated on whether ECB policymakers might signal a possible end to the central bank's bond purchase program at its upcoming meeting amid an improving European economy. Comey's first public appearance since he was fired by U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, might shed more light on a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into alleged Russian meddling in last year's U.S. presidential election. DRW's Brien also said U.S. Treasuries were boosted by a Bloomberg report saying China is prepared to increase its holdings of U.S. government debt under the right circumstances, as the yuan has stabilized against the dollar. Safe-haven bids pushed U.S. 10-year Treasury yields to 2.129 percent, the lowest since Nov. 10, two days after Trump's surprise election victory. Yields were last at 2.143 percent . John Hermann, rates strategist at MUFG in New York, believes the risk of the 10-year yield topping 3.00 percent is quite limited given that the U.S. economy and Trump's fiscal package may disappoint market expectations.  Importantly, should the Democrats fight Trump to the death, and should the Republican party fail to lead, then the Trump fiscal stimulus may fail to arrive from the start – and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note may grind lower back toward 1.30 - even sooner than our models forecast,  he added. U.S. 30-year bonds rose 22/32 in price, yielding 2.807 percent, compared with Monday's 2.84 percent. U.S. two-year yields, meanwhile, were at 1.294 percent, from 1.306 percent late on Monday.

Judge Joan Lefkow said she will rule on a motion by healthcare advocates concerned that Illinois' ongoing budget impasse and its resulting backlog of nearly $14.7 billion in unpaid bills is harming Medicaid recipients' access to medical care. David Chizewer, a lawyer representing the recipients, told Lefkow earlier on Tuesday that a court determination giving precedence to Medicaid payments could lead to a compromise with the state over the next few days. Otherwise, the plaintiffs are asking the court to begin contempt proceedings against the nation's fifth-largest state. Illinois officials have warned that an increase in priority payments could push the cash-strapped state to the point where court-mandated spending could exceed available revenue. [nL1N1IY2GV] Each month, priority payments of $1.85 billion are allocated to schools, local governments, payroll, bonds and consent decrees, consuming 90 percent of Illinois' monthly revenue, according to a court document filed by the state. Both sides told Lefkow on Tuesday that they failed to reach a compromise on speeding money to managed-care organizations participating in the Medicaid program, which provides health services to 3 million poor and disabled Illinois residents. The plaintiffs are from cases dating back to 1992 and that resulted in federal consent decrees requiring the state to continue to make Medicaid payments despite its budget problems. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature.  Lawmakers ended their spring session last week without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois' credit ratings from S&P; and Moody's Investors Service to a step above junk. [nL1N1IY1R2] Brent Stratton, an assistant Illinois attorney general, said the issue is not that the state is unwilling to pay Medicaid providers, but that it is unable to pay them promptly. He told the judge that missing  high priority  payments on Illinois' roughly $30 billion of general obligation bonds would result in a default, while skipping payments to public school districts could force some to shut down. S&P; has warned that Illinois' budget crisis could lead to bond payments being squeezed out by other spending priorities.

State examiners are now conducting the exam, which pertains to New Jersey becoming Prudential's  group supervisor  under a 2014 law, Vice Chairman Mark Grier said during a presentation. The role confers broad authority, and allows the state to review all of Prudential's operations, including those that do not pertain to insurance. Prudential, headquartered in Newark, New Jersey, sells individual and group insurance products in the U.S. and abroad. Its investment arm, PGIM, manages over $1 trillion in assets, including for outside investors – a business state insurance regulators have not traditionally overseen. U.S. insurers have long been ruled by a patchwork of state regulators, but federal regulators have taken on a bigger role since the 2008 financial crisis. Prudential is one of two U.S. insurers designated as a  systematically important financial institution,  or SIFI, by federal regulators, subjecting it to higher capital requirements and tougher oversight than smaller peers. New Jersey also works in tandem with the Federal Reserve, Prudential's other group supervisor. The New Jersey examination  covers all material entities in the group regardless of location or type of business, including whether the business is insurance or non-insurance,  Marshall McKnight, a spokesman for the state’s Department of Banking and Insurance said. As New Jersey's role has expanded, Prudential is hoping oversight from Washington will ease. The Trump administration and Republican lawmakers are re-examining the SIFI designation process as part of a broader effort to reduce regulatory burdens on U.S. business. Prudential is also keeping a close eye on a lawsuit involving MetLife Inc, which has so far successfully fought its SIFI designation in court, but is facing an appeal from the federal government.

With Temer's future on the line because of an ongoing corruption investigation and an electoral fraud trial that begins later Tuesday, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) is considering leaving the cabinet and quitting the coalition whatever the outcome.     The breakaway movement is led by a group of young PSDB lawmakers in the lower house, known as  the black heads  for the color of their hair, not yet gray from age. They fear corruption accusations against Temer and his Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) could further tarnish their own party that is already beset by scandals involving its own leaders.  Temer, who is accused of receiving millions in bribes from giant meatpacker JBS SA, has won time from PSDB elders in the Senate, as they have not found a consensus figure to replace Temer should he be pushed from office and with Brazil's long-suffering economy showing signs of life.  Both younger and older PSDB members, however, agree the party must support Temer's labor and pension reforms to consolidate an economic recovery crucial for their ambitions of returning to the presidency after a 16-year dry spell.     According to PSDB Senator Ricardo Ferraco, an influential politician in charge of drafting the labor reform, some of the party elders are changing their minds and considering a breakup.   Temer put a good government plan in place, but we cannot ignore the corruption allegations,  said Ferraco, 53, from his Senate office overlooking the futuristic capital.  We are convinced the reforms need to continue whoever is the president.   The party is split on whether it should wait to leave Temer's coalition until the electoral court decides whether or not to unseat him for alleged use of illegal funds to finance his 2014 election campaign when he ran as Dilma Rousseff's running mate.  Ferraco said the party should break away this week even before the court reaches a decision, which could take weeks or months.  Another party leader and member of its executive board, Jose Anibal, called for caution and said the party should not leave the coalition without a final decision from the court.   A big majority doesn't want to backtrack on what we have gained so far. We cannot lose those economic gains,  Anibal said.  With three ministers in the cabinet and the third largest representation in Congress, a PSDB break could precipitate the fall of Temer, just one year after the impeachment of Rousseff, whose leftist Workers Party ruled the country for 13 years.   Temer's demise could put an end to his reform agenda to cap surging pension expenditures and close a widening fiscal deficit that cost Brazil its investment grade credit rating.   The PSDB, created by breakaway leftist dissidents from Temer's PMDB after the end of Brazil's 21-year dictatorship, was credited with defeating years-long hyperinflation and recession during its rule between 1995-2002.   For the first time in years, the PSDB has a clear shot at winning the presidency in 2018 after grave corruption allegations have weakened its arch rival the Workers' Party. Lawmakers said that Geraldo Alckmin, the governor of the country's most populous state, Sao Paulo, could be the PSDB candidate for 2018. Alckmin's main ally and mayor of the city of Sao Paulo, Joao Doria, is also a possible contender.    The PSDB, however, is also reeling from corruption accusations against its leaders, including 2014 presidential candidate Aecio Neves.  For first-time PSDB congressman Betinho Gomes, the party should renew itself by distancing itself from corruption allegations now.       We don't want to boycott Brazil or the government, but our electorate is demanding answers,  Gomes said.  We should go our separate way, but remain committed with the reforms.

The thrust is to allow a wider range of conditions to be set in the workplace rather than at sectoral level. Another goal is to set minimum/maximum compensation awards in unfair dismissal cases and speed up labor tribunal processing of such cases. The  El Khomri  labor reform law adopted in 2016 ran into stiff opposition from several labor unions whose main argument was that it undermined the primacy of France's Labour Code - a body of laws and standards built up over the past 200 years. The new reforms go further. Here are key elements: Workplace Rules: Goal is to introduce a lengthy list of issues which can be set at company level. The El Khomri law introduced the possibility of opting out of sector-wide agreements to set overtime pay rates and the new reform would extend the list of opt-outs to other areas.  On Tuesday, the government did not say which issues those would be and that will be the subject of negotiations with unions. Dismissal Awards: Goal is to cap unfair dismissal compensation awards and cut the time taken to reach verdicts in labor tribunals. The argument is that employers need more visibility on time and cost of disputed dismissals and will be less reticent to recruit if they have that. Attempts to include this in past years were dropped because the constitutional court first struck down the measure on technical grounds and the previous Socialist government later decided to push other elements of the reform through instead. Referendum Rule on Workplace Accords Goal is to promote recourse to workplace accords that opt out of sector-wide collective bargaining terms, and to do so by promoting recourse to approval of company-level agreements by a workplace referendum. The 2016 El Khomri reform allows - in cases where a company-level deal on pay and conditions does not muster enough union backing - for workplace accords to be adopted by referendum, as long as it is called by a union.  The aim now is to generalize that course of action by giving employers the right to call a referendum.  Shrink Number of Consultative Bodies: The goal is to reduce the number of in-house forums via which employees are consulted on issues ranging from work hours and conditions to health and safety.  The government said its aim was to merge at least three of the current four bodies. Timeframe: June 28: bill allowing the government to pass executive decrees on the labor reform to be presented to cabinet Summer: parliament to discuss and vote on the bill Before Sept. 21: executive decrees to be published Spring 2018: separate bill to reform the unemployment insurance system and vocational training to be reviewed by parliament Later in 2018: pension reform      Reporting by Brian Love; Editing by Michel Rose and Robin Pomeroy","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-labour-factbox-idUSKBN18X2MD"},

The growing diplomatic rift has raised concerns about global access to Qatar's LNG, especially after some regional ports in the Persian Gulf said they would not accept Qatari-flagged vessels. Commodities traders have grown concerned Qatar's LNG could be barred from Saudi Arabia or from traversing Egypt's Suez Canal, though so far no limitations have been imposed.

Exxon, working with government-controlled energy company Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL], has invested in LNG-processing plants, transport ships and related infrastructure.  The pair, which earlier this year were awarded a contract to explore for gas off the coast of Cyprus, also control the Golden Pass LNG facility in the United States with ConocoPhillips (COP.N).

Cink played a light schedule last year as his wife Lisa received treatment for breast cancer, even skipping the British Open where he beat Tom Watson in a playoff to win at Turnberry in 2009.  But he has played more frequently this year and his competitive sharpness was evident as he finished equal fourth at the 36-hole qualifier in Columbus on Monday, earning one of 14 spots from that venue for the U.S. Open, which starts at Erin Hills in Wisconsin next Thursday.   “I was not in competitive form last year,” Cink, 44, told the U.S. Golf Association (USGA) website. “We were right in the midst of Lisa's treatments, and we were focused on that, so I didn't even try to qualify. To come back this year and get through successfully, it really means a lot to me.  Cink has not played a major since the 2015 British Open at St. Andrews. “I have a long career,” said the lanky American. “I should say I am having a long career, and majors are my focus now.” The Columbus qualifier stretched into Tuesday morning, when four players had to return to play off for three spots in the Open field. Michael Putnam, a former United States Walker Cup player, was the unlucky man to miss out. More than 900 players competed for 72 spots in the Open at 10 sectional qualifiers around the U.S. on Monday, after previous international qualifiers in England and Japan. Wisconsin native Steve Stricker advanced via the Memphis qualifier, after the USGA rejected his request for a special invitation in an event that will be held barely an hour from his home.     “Not getting an exemption was a motivational factor,” said the 12-times PGA Tour winner. “Not that I deserved one, but it’s been driving me to achieve this goal. And I’m just happy that I’m going to get to play. It’s a relief to get to play in the first one in my home state.” Among other qualifiers on Monday were amateurs Joaquin Niemann and Stewart Hagestad. Chilean Niemann is the world’s number one-ranked amateur, while Californian Hagestad was the leading amateur at the U.S. Masters in April. U.S. Open qualifying is more than about making up the numbers in the field. Sectional qualifiers occasionally lift the trophy, most recently American Lucas Glover in 2009.

Britain's general election as it maps its exit from the European Union, the European Central Bank's policy meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before a Senate panel could all affect investor sentiment. Comey was investigating whether Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia colluded to sway the 2016 U.S. election when he was fired by Trump in May. His testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for the U.S. President's agenda of rolling back regulations and overhauling the tax code. British Prime Minister Theresa May looks on course to increase her parliamentary majority, an opinion poll showed on Tuesday, shortly after another survey suggested the race with the opposition Labour Party was neck and neck. Investors will also watch out for the European Central Bank's meeting, where policymakers are expected to take a more benign view of the economy, according to sources. “We have a lot of stuff on Thursday.

Krisha,  a 2015 film about addiction that drew from the writer-director's personal life, went on to be one of the best reviewed films of the year and won several awards. Now Shults, 27, appears to have done it again with a horror and psychological thriller, prompted by a deeply personal experience, that has scored glowing reviews.  It Comes at Night,  out in U.S. movie theaters on Friday, revolves around a family of three, led by dad Paul (Joel Edgerton), that is trying to survive in a plague-infested North America. The film starts with a shocking death and develops further into unease and paranoia when another family of three turns up at the rustic, remote home asking for refuge. Paul begrudgingly agrees.  Shults said the impetus for what he calls a scary, emotional and non-conventional horror film, came from his own father's death.  The opening scene of the movie... is what I said to my dad on his deathbed, and he was full of fear and regret and he didn't want to let go.  It was a traumatic thing that changed my life and two months after that I wrote this script and it like spewed out of me in three days... I was clearly grappling with the emotions that were going on in my head and applying that to this fictional narrative,  he said. Shults said much of the character of teen son Travis, who has nightmares, is also based on himself.  I have trouble sleeping at night. I'm really a night owl and night is when my brain is really active and it's when everyone else is asleep and you have to confront your own thoughts in a world that's quiet.  Despite the glowing reviews, one person who has not watched the finished film is Shults himself.  We did a small test screening with a way rougher cut a while back and I had a few drinks and I broke down sobbing at the end of it uncontrollably, which I think was due to the fact of the personal nature of the movie but also just how exhausted I was from working and a few drinks,  he said.

Papp,USA,TRUMP/TWITTER,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A free-speech institute on Tuesday sent a letter to President Donald Trump demanding the prolific tweeter unblock certain Twitter users on grounds the practice violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Trump's @realDonaldTrump account recently blocked a number of accounts that replied to his tweets with commentary that criticized, mocked or disagreed with his actions. Twitter users are unable to see or respond to tweets from accounts that block them. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in New York said in its letter that the blocking suppressed speech in a public forum protected by the Constitution. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Twitter Inc said it had no comment. Alex Abdo, the institute's senior staff attorney, likened Twitter to a modern form of town hall meeting or public comment periods for government agency proposals, both venues where U.S. law requires even-handed treatment of speech. Eric Goldman, a Santa Clara University law professor who focuses on internet law, said that previous cases involving politicians blocking users on Facebook supported the Knight Institute's position. If the institute should sue, Trump could claim his @realDonaldTrump account is for personal use and separate from his official duties as president, Goldman said. But he called that defense  laughable.  Trump also has a presidential @POTUS Twitter account. The Knight Institute said its arguments would apply with  equal force  to both accounts. Trump's Twitter use has drawn intense media attention for his unvarnished commentary about his agenda and attacks on critics. His tweets are often retweeted tens of thousands of times, and can shape the news cycle. Legal experts have said his tweets may directly affect policy. A chain of postings about his travel ban may hamper his administration's defense in courts. The letter said Trump or his aides blocked the accounts @AynRandPaulRyan and @joepabike, belonging to songwriter Holly O'Reilly and professional cyclist and author Joseph M. Papp, respectively. O'Reilly was blocked on May 28 after posting a brief animated clip of Pope Francis appearing uncomfortable during a meeting with Trump with a caption,  this is pretty much how the whole world sees you,  the letter said. Papp learned he was blocked on June 4 after responding to a Trump tweet with a tweet labeling the president a  #fake leader.  The accounts are just two of several that have been blocked by Trump or his aides, Abdo said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-twitter-idUSL1N1J31IZ"},

Minister Adel Al-Jubeir said Qatar knew exactly what to do to restore relations with Riyadh and its Arab allies.  We want to see Qatar implement the promises it made a few years back with regard its support of extremist groups, regards its hostile media and interference in affairs of other countries,  Jubeir told reporters in Paris.  Nobody wants to hurt Qatar. It has to choose whether it must move in one direction or another direction . Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain said on Monday they would sever all ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism.   We took this step with great pain so that it understands that these policies are not sustainable and must change,  Jubeir said.   Jubeir added that Qatar was undermining the Palestinian Authority and Egypt in its support of Hamas and the Muslim brotherhood.   We don't think this is good. Qatar has to stop these policies so that it can contribute to stability in the Middle East,  he said. Jubeir declined to say exactly what he wanted Qatar to do immediately, but said the measures taken by Arab states, including a sea, land and air blockade would have a considerable cost on the country.   We believe that common sense and logic will convince Qatar to take the right steps. The decisions that were made were very strong and will have a fairly large cost on Qatar and we do not believe that Qataris want to sustain those costs,  he said. The campaign to isolate Qatar is disrupting trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food, and deepening fears of a possible shock to the global gas market, where the  Gulf state is a major player. Jubeir also dismissed Qatar's recent rapprochement with Shi'ite Iran - Sunni Saudi Arabia's arch foe in the region - saying that countries that deal with Tehran  deal with it at their own peril .  When asked whether there could be military measures should Doha not change course, Jubeir said:  I hope not.

Judge Joan Lefkow said she will rule on a motion by healthcare advocates concerned that Illinois' ongoing budget impasse and its resulting backlog of nearly $14.7 billion in unpaid bills is harming Medicaid recipients' access to medical care. David Chizewer, a lawyer representing the recipients, told Lefkow earlier on Tuesday that a court determination giving precedence to Medicaid payments could lead to a compromise with the state over the next few days. Otherwise, the plaintiffs are asking the court to begin contempt proceedings against the nation's fifth-largest state. Illinois officials have warned that an increase in priority payments could push the cash-strapped state to the point where court-mandated spending could exceed available revenue. [nL1N1IY2GV] Each month, priority payments of $1.85 billion are allocated to schools, local governments, payroll, bonds and consent decrees, consuming 90 percent of Illinois' monthly revenue, according to a court document filed by the state. Both sides told Lefkow on Tuesday that they failed to reach a compromise on speeding money to managed-care organizations participating in the Medicaid program, which provides health services to 3 million poor and disabled Illinois residents. The plaintiffs are from cases dating back to 1992 and that resulted in federal consent decrees requiring the state to continue to make Medicaid payments despite its budget problems. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature.  Lawmakers ended their spring session last week without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois' credit ratings from S&P; and Moody's Investors Service to a step above junk. [nL1N1IY1R2] Brent Stratton, an assistant Illinois attorney general, said the issue is not that the state is unwilling to pay Medicaid providers, but that it is unable to pay them promptly. He told the judge that missing  high priority  payments on Illinois' roughly $30 billion of general obligation bonds would result in a default, while skipping payments to public school districts could force some to shut down. S&P; has warned that Illinois' budget crisis could lead to bond payments being squeezed out by other spending priorities.

The appearance of the B-52, a long-range bomber that first went into service in the 1950s, irked Moscow. A Russian Foreign Ministry official said the plane's appearance in Europe would not help ease tensions between the West and Russia. A former Russian Air Force commander called the move  disrespectful.  Russian air defense systems detected the U.S. bomber at around 1000 Moscow time as it was flying over neutral waters parallel to the Russian border and sent a Sukhoi Su-27 jet to intercept it, the Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement.    The Russian SU-27 crew, having approached at a safe distance, identified the aircraft as an American B-52 strategic bomber and escorted it  until such time as it changed course and flew away from the border area, the ministry said. Russia said the SU-27 took off from its Baltic Fleet air defense unit, which is based in the European exclave of Kaliningrad. The U.S. military said its aircraft was in international airspace and declined immediate comment on the Russian plane's actions.  We can confirm that the U.S. Air Force B-52 was operating in international airspace but we don’t have any information to provide at this time regarding the behavior of Russian aircraft,  Air Force spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said. NATO members such as Britain regularly report scrambling jets to intercept Russian nuclear-capable bombers flying close to their air space. It is less common for Russia to report using its fighters for the same reason.  In a separate incident, Russia said an MiG-31 jet fighter had intercepted a Norwegian patrol plane over the Barents Sea. Russia's Defence Ministry identified the plane as a P-3 Orion anti-submarine aircraft. The Russian Defence Ministry complained that the Norwegian plane had flown close to Russia's state border with its transponders switched off. The Norwegian military confirmed the encounter, but said it was  normal.  Moscow was more put out by the B-52's appearance. The state-backed Sputnik news agency cited a Foreign Ministry official, Mikhail Ulyanov, as saying Moscow believed a  number of U.S. B-52s had recently been transferred from their base in Louisiana to Britain to take part in military exercises.  The fact that NATO forces are converging near Russia's borders and carrying out military exercises supported by strategic bombers from the USA capable of carrying nuclear weapons hardly helps de-escalate tensions in Europe,  Sputnik quoted Ulyanov as saying. U.S. forces are engaged in various exercises with Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and other partner nations as part of the Saber Strike war games. The United States is also taking part in the annual BALTOPS naval training exercise in the Baltic Sea which runs until June 16.  Pyotr Deinekin, a former Russian Air Force commander, was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying that he could not recall the last time a B-52 had flown over the Baltic Sea and that the incident raised troubling questions.  Such behavior does not deserve respect,  said Deinekin, who said Russia needed to establish what weaponry the B-52 was carrying. The B-52 was designed to attack Moscow's most vital targets via the North Pole in the event of a nuclear war when the Soviet Union still existed, Deinekin said.   Strategic bombers should not fly so close to our land borders,  he said.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain said on Monday they would sever all ties including transport links with Qatar, escalating past diplomatic disagreements. Within hours, the UAE barred all vessels coming to or from Qatar using its anchorage point off Fujairah, a popular location for bunkering, where vessels take on fuel of their own. Platts' move is unlikely to have a significant impact on the broader oil market because Qatar is one of the smaller producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Any disruption to Qatar's liquefied natural gas exports, an area in which it is a major world player, could hit global prices, but there is no indication so far of that happening. Al-Shaheen crude from Qatar usually loads onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, meaning flexibility of movement is critical to transporting oil out of the region.   It is typical in the Gulf to co-load VLCCs (very large crude carriers) in combinations that include crude oil from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE and Oman,  S&P; Global Platts said in a note to subscribers.    As such, restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar, including al-Shaheen,  it said.  Riyadh issued a similar shipping ban. Trading sources say cargoes of al-Shaheen usually load onto VLCCs in Saudi Arabia before sailing to Asia. Trades, bids and offers for Qatar's al-Shaheen grade, a medium sour crude, have been included in Platts' assessment of its Dubai price benchmark, which underpins the vast majority of oil trades in Asia, since January 2016. The Dubai benchmark is backed by Dubai and Oman crude, Abu Dhabi's Upper Zakum and Murban grades, as well as al-Shaheen.  Qatar-loading al-Shaheen may not be nominated in the Platts Dubai Markets on Close process without mutual agreement between buyer and seller,  the company said in an emailed statement.  Since its introduction as a deliverable into the Dubai basket in January 2016, al-Shaheen has performed well. This review is to ensure that the Dubai benchmark is not negatively impacted by the current uncertainties surrounding Qatar’s relations with its Gulf neighbors.  Buyers and sellers could mutually agree to alternate loadings of al-Shaheen cargoes, but sellers should not impose this, Platts said.  If a party wants to bid up Dubai they won’t agree to any of the sellers’ request to deliver al-Shaheen, so it will definitely affect (the benchmark),” a source from an Asian refiner said. Sellers in the Platts trading window were previously allowed to deliver, without buyers’ consent, any of the five crude grades that make up the Dubai benchmark. Platts said it would continue to assess and publish independent values for other Qatari-loading crudes during the review. It added that the process would not immediately impact existing nominations for cargoes loading in June and July against trades previously reported in the Platts pricing process, known as the market-on-close. The company, a unit of S&P; Global Inc, produces a number of benchmark prices for the crude oil market, including dated Brent.

The 19-year-old, ranked 47 and playing in the French Open main draw for only the second time, gave up the opening five games of a rain-ravaged match but recovered in stunning fashion to win 16 of the last 21 games for a 4-6 6-2 6-2 victory. Ostapenko, who turns 20 on Thursday when she faces fellow birthday girl Timea Bacsinszky of Switzerland, who will be 28, is the first Latvian woman to reach a grand slam semi and first teenager to do so at the French since Serb Ana Ivanovic in 2007. There was no doubt she deserved it. She belted 38 winners and made 50 unforced errors as she threw caution to the wind with a high-risk approach that Denmark's conservative 11th seed Wozniacki had no answer to.  I love you all,  the bubbly Ostapenko told the fans after claiming the biggest win of her career. Wozniacki, playing in her second quarter-final at the French, had no solution once her opponent found her range.  She kept me on the back foot.... She goes for her shots. Her shots are hard to read, so you don't really feel comfortable at any point in the match,  said the Dane. Not Promising Ostapenko's day had not started in promising fashion. Jun 6, 2017; Paris, France; Jelena Ostapenko (LAT) reacts during her match against Caroline Wozniacki (DEN) on day ten of the 2017 French Open tennis tournament at Stade Roland Garros. Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY SportsWicked winds bent the flag poles and red brick dust was whipped up into the players' eyes in the opening games in which Ostapenko could hardly locate the court. Wozniacki merely had to keep the ball in play to build a 5-0 lead as her unseeded opponent sprayed errors. Ostapenko's mood was as dark as the menacing black clouds circling above and she gesticulated forlornly towards her mother Jelena, who is also her coach, as shot after shot flew long. She finally got on the scoreboard in the sixth game, though, as her aggressive game clicked and she began to boss the rallies with a whippy forehand that Wozniacki could not read. Having clawed her way back to 4-5, the errors returned and Wozniacki took the opening set. Undeterred, Ostapenko maintained the momentum and had Wozniacki scurrying around behind the baseline as the Latvian walloped the ball into the corners, often finishing rallies by thrashing away mid-court volleys. Ostapenko carved out a 5-2 lead and Wozniacki looked relieved to get off court when torrential rain arrived to force a three-hour delay. The stoppage should have helped the Dane but when play resumed Ostapenko continued where she left off, holding serve to level the match. Wozniacki saved a break point to edge 2-1 ahead in the decider before another rain interruption. It did little to dampen Ostapenko's fire, though, and it was one-way traffic in the match's third instalment as she raced to a fourth consecutive victory against Wozniacki.

In 2018, however, carbon dioxide emissions from transportation, power plants, homes and businesses should climb about 2.2 percent, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. That increase would be due to forecasts for a colder winter, higher economic growth and rising gas prices, the EIA said. The projected 2018 increase in carbon dioxide emissions has nothing to do with U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the agency said. That exit will not take place until Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the next presidential election. U.S. emissions have been falling for several years, largely because coal consumption is declining as power plants increasingly use gas to generate electricity. Coal lost its title as the primary fuel for power plants to gas in 2016 after holding that crown for a century. EIA said coal's share of generation would rise to 30.9 percent in 2017 and 31 percent in 2018 from 30.4 percent in 2016. Natural gas will take a 31.4 percent share of power generation in 2017 compared with 33.8 percent in 2016, before rising to 31.9 percent in 2018. Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions were expected to fall to 5,134 million metric tons in 2017, which would be the lowest since 1992, before rising to 5,248 MMT in 2018, according to EIA's latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO). The all-time peak of 6,021 MMT was in 2007. EIA projected U.S. coal consumption would rise to 731 million short tons in 2017 and 743 million tons in 2018. That compares with 730 million tons in 2016, the least since 1982, and an all-time high of 1,128 million tons in 2007. Gas prices are expected to rise to an average of $3.16 per million British thermal units in 2017 and $3.41 in 2018 from $2.51 in 2016. EIA said dry gas production in 2017 would rise to 73.30 billion cubic feet per day from 72.29 bcfd in 2016. They said U.S. gas consumption would fall to 73.41 bcfd in 2017 from a record 75.12 bcfd in 2016. EIA projected both production and consumption would rebound in 2018 to record highs with output hitting 76.57 bcfd and usage reaching 76.24 bcfd.

Alex Abdo, the institute's senior staff attorney, likened Twitter to a modern form of town hall meeting or public comment periods for government agency proposals, both venues where U.S. law requires even-handed treatment of speech. Eric Goldman, a Santa Clara University law professor who focuses on internet law, said that previous cases involving politicians blocking users on Facebook (FB.O) supported the Knight Institute's position. If the institute should sue, Trump could claim his @realDonaldTrump account is for personal use and separate from his official duties as president, Goldman said. But he called that defense  laughable.  Trump also has a presidential @POTUS Twitter account. The Knight Institute said its arguments would apply with  equal force  to both accounts.  Trump's Twitter use has drawn intense media attention for his unvarnished commentary about his agenda and attacks on critics. His tweets are often retweeted tens of thousands of times, and can shape the news cycle.  Legal experts have said his tweets may directly affect policy. A chain of postings about his travel ban may hamper his administration's defense in courts. The letter said Trump or his aides blocked the accounts @AynRandPaulRyan and @joepabike, belonging to songwriter Holly O'Reilly and professional cyclist and author Joseph M. Papp, respectively. O'Reilly was blocked on May 28 after posting a brief animated clip of Pope Francis appearing uncomfortable during a meeting with Trump with a caption,  this is pretty much how the whole world sees you,  the letter said. Papp learned he was blocked on June 4 after responding to a Trump tweet with a tweet labeling the president a  #fake leader.  The accounts are just two of several that have been blocked by Trump or his aides, Abdo said.

The measure, to be signed by Mayor Ed Murray on Tuesday, was approved on a 7-1 vote despite staunch opposition from the American Beverage Association, which said the tax would hit poor and working-class families and small businesses hardest.

The yen and gold also gained amid prevailing caution as an Arab rift opened up around Qatar, and ahead of testimony from the former head of the FBI, a British election and the European Central Bank's next move, which all happen on Thursday.  We have risk events piling up,  said Blake Gwinn, U.S. rates strategist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.  We'll be very focused on what happens on Thursday, but it might end up being a dud.  Wall Street was lower for a second day after both European and Asian stocks dropped during their sessions. Retail stocks also pulled shares lower, with Macy's Inc losing ground after a warning on profit margins, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc down after rival Amazon.com Inc said it would offer a discount on its popular Prime subscription service to shoppers who receive U.S. government aid. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 8.22 points, or 0.04 percent, to 21,175.82, the S&P; 500 lost 0.61 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,435.49 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.28 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,301.96. On what BayernLB analysts called  Super Thursday , British voters will also go to polls in an increasingly unpredictable general election, the European Central Bank is due to meet and former FBI director James Comey will testify before Congress.  Once these events pass, we may have a little more clarity and therefore see a little less caution in the markets,  said Craig Erlam, a market analyst for OANDA securities. The diplomatic spat in the Middle East initially dented oil prices, which slid below $47 a barrel on Tuesday before recovering on technical support. U.S. crude oil futures settled up 79 cents, or 1.67 percent, at $48.19 per barrel. Brent was last up 1.17 percent on the day, or 58 cents, at $50.05. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.62 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.14 percent. Investors piled into gold, U.S. Treasuries and German government bonds - some of the safest assets in the world - thrusting German 10-year borrowing costs to six-week lows. U.S. Treasury yields dropped to a seven-month low of 2.129 percent at one stage and gold briefly touched a high of $1,295.97, prices not seen since November. Lower bond yields come despite the Federal Reserve widely expected to raise U.S. interest rates a quarter point next week, but also follows a run of weaker-than-expected U.S. data. Sterling was 0.12 percent lower ahead of Thursday's general election. British Prime Minister Theresa May looks on course to increase her parliamentary majority, an opinion poll showed on Tuesday, shortly after another survey suggested the race with the opposition Labour Party was neck and neck. The dollar, meanwhile, was fell to a more than six-week low against the yen and was at its weakest since the November U.S. election against a basket of other world currencies. The dip came ahead of Comey's expected testimony on Thursday. Reports suggest the former FBI chief plans to talk about conversations in which U.S. President Trump allegedly pressured him to drop his investigation into former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials.

PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) - The Minnesota woman who streamed images of her boyfriend as he lay bleeding to death after being shot by a policeman during a traffic stop said on Tuesday she showed the video because she did not trust police. Diamond Reynolds, who streamed the immediate aftermath of the July 2016 shooting on Facebook Live, said during emotional testimony at the Ramsey County District Court in St. Paul, Minnesota, that she was afraid for her 4-year-old daughter, who was in the vehicle's back seat when the shooting occurred.  I know people are not protected against the police,  she said.  I feared for my daughter's safety and my safety because a gun was pointed in our car.      The killing of Philando Castile, 32, by St. Anthony Police Department officer Jeronimo Yanez, who was charged with second-degree manslaughter, sparked national outrage and triggered weeks of protests in St. Paul and Minneapolis.    The shooting in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights during a traffic stop, like similar incidents across the United States, fueled public debate about appropriate use of force by law enforcement against minorities.        Yanez fired his gun because Castile was reaching for a weapon he disclosed he had, Yanez's attorney, Paul Engh, said during opening arguments on Monday. Engh said Yanez, who will testify and previously pleaded not guilty, feared for his life. Engh said the police dashboard camera video of the stop showed Castile ignored two commands about not reaching for or pulling out his gun. On Tuesday, Reynolds, 27, dabbing her eyes with a tissue and sometimes sobbing, said she was  broken, hurt, confused, lost.   The police video, as well as Reynolds' Facebook post, were played in court. Yanez fired seven shots, hitting Castile five times, including twice in the heart, prosecutors said.  Yanez has said he was justified in stopping Castile's car because he resembled a suspect in a convenience store robbery, according to court documents. Castile's vehicle also had a broken brake light. After Castile was stopped, Yanez asked him to present his driver's license and insurance card. Castile disclosed he was carrying a licensed handgun. The exchange took just over a minute and Castile's permit to carry a gun was later found in his wallet. In response to questions by Yanez's attorney, Reynolds said she and Castile smoked marijuana a lot, but not every day. Marijuana was found in the car.

Investors were also drawn to gold, seen as a safe place to park assets, by uncertainty around the testimony to a Senate committee by former FBI Director James Comey.                                             A weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of other currencies, while lower yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.                  Weak economic data from the United States has reduced expectations of rapid U.S. interest rate rises this year, but the Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates at its June policy meeting next week.                               Interest rate rises push bond yields higher and tend to strengthen the dollar.      Spot gold        was up 1.1 percent at $1,294.34 an ounce by 2:25 p.m. EDT (1825 GMT), having earlier touched its highest since Nov. 9 at $1,295.97.      U.S. gold futures         rose 1.2 percent to settle at $1,297.50. The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was down 0.18 percent at 96.624            Gold has risen more than 6 percent since a low of $1,213.81 in early May as political turmoil in the United States created doubts that President Donald Trump could enact economic stimulus, pushing down the dollar and bond yields.      Gold surged to highs since Election Day as geopolitical concerns with the UK election and Comey testimony both due Thursday as well as fresh tensions on the Arabian peninsula triggered strong buying in spot as well as options,  said Tai Wong, director of base and precious metals trading for BMO Capital Markets in New York.       European Central Bank policymakers will take a more benign view of the economy on Thursday and will even discuss dropping some of their pledges to ramp up stimulus if needed, sources told Reuters.                   A decision by major gold consumer India to levy a sales tax on gold at 3 percent rather than the expected 5 percent was supporting bullion prices by spurring demand for physical metal, analysts said.                  From a technical standpoint, gold may be poised for further gains, analysts said.      The long-term bearish trend line that had been in place since the year 2011 has broken down and this could pave the way for significant long-term gains,  said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com.      A decisive break above the last swing high at $1,295 is what the bulls want to see now.      In other precious metals, silver        rose 0.9 percent to $17.67 an ounce, its highest level since April 25.      Palladium        climbed 1.5 percent to $854.30 an ounce after rising to $858.70, its highest since September 2014 while platinum        gained 0.9 percent to $958.8 an ounce after touching $967.50, the strongest since April 24.     Platinum and palladium, mainly used to make auto catalysts that clean exhaust fumes, have rallied despite data showing weaker global auto sales in May, Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said in a note.      We see technical rather than fundamental factors behind this (palladium) rally, supporting bullish sentiment in the futures market. We stick to our negative view and short position, expecting prices to realign with the weaker demand backdrop over the coming months.

Banks including HSBC, Societe Generale, ABN Amro, Citigroup and ING, have appointed legal advisers to consider the case for extending the $2 billion line of credit,  so the Hong Kong-based company can continue its lengthy search for a major new investor to recapitalise the business , the FT said. Law firm Clifford Chance has been appointed by Noble's lenders to advise on whether bankruptcy or liquidation would give them the best means of recouping the borrowing provided to Noble if the credit line is not extended, the paper said. Banks have also hired consultants Alvarez & Marsal, who are assessing the collateral pledged by Noble against the credit line, FT said. The struggling commodity trader is asking banks to extend the credit line until the end of the year while it looks for a strategic investor. Citigroup, ING and Noble Group declined to comment. HSBC, Societe Generale and ABN Amro did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside regular business hours.  I think it is likely that (Noble) will get some extension (to the credit line) but it all depends on how much the lenders believe in the credibility of management and its plans,  an executive at one of Noble’s lenders was quoted as telling the FT. Noble has struggled ever since Iceberg Research questioned its accounts in early 2015, which came at a time of a brutal downturn in commodity markets. The company has stood by its accounts. But the share price collapsed and credit rating downgrades, management upheavals and a series of writedowns, asset sales and a fundraising ensued. Earlier this year the company reported it made a net profit of just $8.7 million in 2016, following a net loss of $1.67 billion in 2015, its first loss in nearly two decades. Noble's market value has shrunk to $354 million currently from $6 billion in February 2015.

Minister Adel Al-Jubeir said Qatar knew exactly what to do to restore relations with Riyadh and its Arab allies.  We want to see Qatar implement the promises it made a few years back with regard its support of extremist groups, regards its hostile media and interference in affairs of other countries,  Jubeir told reporters in Paris.  Nobody wants to hurt Qatar. It has to choose whether it must move in one direction or another direction . Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain said on Monday they would sever all ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism.  We took this step with great pain so that it understands that these policies are not sustainable and must change,  Jubeir said. Jubeir added that Qatar was undermining the Palestinian Authority and Egypt in its support of Hamas and the Muslim brotherhood.  We don't think this is good. Qatar has to stop these policies so that it can contribute to stability in the Middle East,  he said. Jubeir declined to say exactly what he wanted Qatar to do immediately, but said the measures taken by Arab states, including a sea, land and air blockade would have a considerable cost on the country.  We believe that common sense and logic will convince Qatar to take the right steps. The decisions that were made were very strong and will have a fairly large cost on Qatar and we do not believe that Qataris want to sustain those costs,  he said. The campaign to isolate Qatar is disrupting trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food, and deepening fears of a possible shock to the global gas market, where the Gulf state is a major player. Jubeir also dismissed Qatar's recent rapprochement with Shi'ite Iran - Sunni Saudi Arabia's arch foe in the region - saying that countries that deal with Tehran  deal with it at their own peril . When asked whether there could be military measures should Doha not change course, Jubeir said:  I hope not.

Last fall, during the waning months of the Obama administration, hundreds of immigrants crossed the river on rafts at this point each day, many willingly handing themselves over to immigration authorities in hopes of being released into the United States to await court proceedings that would decide their fate. Now, the agents look out on an empty landscape. Foot paths up from the water have started to disappear under growing brush, with only the stray baby shoe or toothbrush serving as reminders of that migrant flood. The reason for the change, the agents say, is a perception in Mexico and Central America that President Donald Trump has ended the practice known as  catch-and-release,  in which immigrants caught in the United States without proper documents were released to live free, often for years, as their cases ran through the court system. Now, would-be border violators know  they'll be detained and then turned right back around,  said one of the two agents, Marlene Castro.  It's not worth it anymore,  she said. Castro was simply echoing her boss, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who said on a visit to El Paso, Texas in April, “We have ended dangerous catch-and-release enforcement policies.” But immigration attorneys, government statistics and even some officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which falls under Kelly, suggest that despite the DHS chief's statement, there has been no clear change to the catch-and-release policy. That's in large part because there are legal constraints on who can be detained and for how long, due to a shortage of beds and a court ruling limiting the stay of women and children in custody to 21 days. A separate court ruling limits detention time for immigrants whose countries refuse to repatriate them. And Kelly noted in a February memorandum that asylum seekers that have proven they have a “credible fear” of returning home could be candidates for release if they present “neither a security risk nor a risk of absconding.” Daniel Bible, ICE field office director for Southern Texas, told Reuters he and his colleagues have not been issued new directions, and so continue to release illegal immigrants deemed to be low security risks, usually with notices to appear in court. “We look at each case the same way we always have,  Bible said. DHS spokeswoman Jenny Burke confirmed to Reuters that the agency has not issued new guidance for releasing migrants caught at the border. Asked to explain why there had been no new guidance, given Kelly's statement in April, Burke said, “ICE officers make custody determinations on a case-by-case basis, prioritizing detention resources.” In a memo made public in February, Kelly defined catch and release as any policy that allows immigrants to be released from detention while they await their court hearings, making it easy to abscond. Ending catch and release was one of Trump's central promises during the 2016 presidential campaign. Some advocates who work with migrants say they have seen little change since Trump came into office. “Sure, people are still being released,  said Kevin Appleby, senior director of international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies.  Not because they believe in releasing them, but because there are not enough beds at the moment.  Numbers Game ICE declined to provide data on the number of migrants being released into the United States. But other ICE data not previously published and reviewed by Reuters shows the pool of people not in custody and awaiting court appearances is growing. Since Trump took office in late January, the number of immigrants awaiting court proceedings while living freely in the United States has grown by nearly 30,000, rising by an average of about 7,500 per month, according to the ICE data. During the last seven months of President Barack Obama’s presidency, the rolls of those awaiting legal proceedings outside of custody grew more rapidly, at an average of about 20,600 people per month. Part of the slower rate under Trump can be traced to a 58 percent drop in apprehensions of people crossing the border. Still, the numbers suggest the Trump administration is a long way from ending catch-and-release. In part that is because his administration has come up against the reality that there simply is not enough space in detention centers. Congress has funded about 34,000 beds to detain immigration violators, and the average daily population of detainees has been near or above capacity since before Trump took office. One way the administration hopes to free up detention space is to decrease the time it takes to resolve cases. The Justice Department has requested funding to hire an additional 125 immigration judges over the next two years, an increase of 50 percent. In the meantime, some border officials hope would-be migrants remain nervous. When told that ICE detention centers are still releasing many immigrants to live in the United States, Castro and her border agent colleague, who declined to be named, exchanged a look and then shrugged.  Don't tell them that,  her colleague said. -See a related photo essay here reut.rs/2qZcutn","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-immigration-detention-idUSL1N1J31FM"},

The high-profile health insurer, which sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states including New York and California, for months has said that uncertainty over the payments used to make insurance more affordable could cause it to exit markets next year. Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish two weeks ago reiterated that the company was reviewing its participation in the individual markets that are a key piece of the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump have promised to repeal and replace the law, but have disagreed over the details, creating uncertainty at a time when insurers must submit plans and premium rates for 2018. In addition, Republicans are trying to cut off these Obamacare subsidy payments in court proceedings and President Donald Trump has made conflicting statements about continuing paying them.  Insurance departments across the country have reported that insurers have submitted premium rate increases of up to 50 percent and 60 percent or even higher for 2018. Anthem attributed the Ohio decision to volatility and uncertainty about whether the government would continue to provide cost-sharing subsidies. It said it would continue to sell Obamacare compliant plans outside of the exchange in Pike County, Ohio as well as other individual plans that were grandfathered when the law went into effect. FILE PHOTO: The office building of health insurer Anthem is seen in Los Angeles, California February 5, 2015.Gus RuelasAnthem is the only insurer selling health insurance exchange products in all 88 Ohio counties in 2017 and the only insurer in 20 counties, according to Ohio Department of Insurance spokesman Chris Brock. In 2018, the move would leave about 10,500 people in at least 18 counties with no insurer.  Congressional action is needed to restore stability,  Brock said. The insurance department is looking for options for those affected, he said. Other large health insurers have also pulled out for 2018, including Aetna Inc and Humana Inc, leaving other areas facing the possibility of no insurer. Anthem's decision was made as rate filings were due to the state and after discussions with the insurance department.  States can beg and plead, but much of this is out of their hands,  said Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Anthem shares rose $1.19, or 0.64 percent, to $187.88 in early afternoon trading.

The high-profile health insurer, which sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states including New York and California, for months has said that uncertainty over the payments used to make insurance more affordable could cause it to exit markets next year. Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish two weeks ago reiterated that the company was reviewing its participation in the individual markets that are a key piece of the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump have promised to repeal and replace the law, but have disagreed over the details, creating uncertainty at a time when insurers must submit plans and premium rates for 2018. In addition, Republicans are trying to cut off these Obamacare subsidy payments in court proceedings and President Donald Trump has made conflicting statements about continuing paying them.  Insurance departments across the country have reported that insurers have submitted premium rate increases of up to 50 percent and 60 percent or even higher for 2018. Anthem attributed the Ohio decision to volatility and uncertainty about whether the government would continue to provide cost-sharing subsidies. It said it would continue to sell Obamacare compliant plans outside of the exchange in Pike County, Ohio as well as other individual plans that were grandfathered when the law went into effect. FILE PHOTO: The office building of health insurer Anthem is seen in Los Angeles, California February 5, 2015.Gus RuelasAnthem is the only insurer selling health insurance exchange products in all 88 Ohio counties in 2017 and the only insurer in 20 counties, according to Ohio Department of Insurance spokesman Chris Brock. In 2018, the move would leave about 10,500 people in at least 18 counties with no insurer.  Congressional action is needed to restore stability,  Brock said. The insurance department is looking for options for those affected, he said. Other large health insurers have also pulled out for 2018, including Aetna Inc and Humana Inc, leaving other areas facing the possibility of no insurer. Anthem's decision was made as rate filings were due to the state and after discussions with the insurance department.  States can beg and plead, but much of this is out of their hands,  said Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Anthem shares rose $1.19, or 0.64 percent, to $187.88 in early afternoon trading.

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha's fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).  Traders worried that Riyadh's allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.  Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.  U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding  radical ideology . Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.  Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.  The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf.  Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,  it said.  More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.  Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.  However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world's biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.  Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said:  We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.   Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.  Exclusion Zones  With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.  Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE's port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.  A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017.Thomas White/IllustrationLying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world's most important ports for the global energy market.  Qatar, the world's biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.  The UAE's ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.   This shouldn't affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It's a minor inconvenience,  one LNG trader said.  LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.  Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.  Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country's Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.  Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.  Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.   The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,  a trading source said.  The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway's Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.  Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.           Additional reporting by Jessica Jaganathan, Mark Tay, Yousri Ahmed, Jonathan Saul and Eman Kamel; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and David Stamp","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities-idUSKBN18X1Y2"},

The film, starring Israeli actress Gal Gadot, smashed box office records on its opening weekend, raking in more than $103 million in the United States - a record for a movie directed by a woman, Patty Jenkins. The film broke the previous record for a movie directed by a woman held by Sam Taylor-Johnson for  Fifty Shades of Grey . Online debates ahead of the film's release about the Amazonian superhero's lack of armpit hair and the furor surrounding her selection last year as a U.N. honorary ambassador, have only served to boost box office takings. But it is above all the depiction of the sword-wielding, lasso-tossing character as an empowered woman that accounts for the film's triumph, said Melissa Silverstein, founder of the Women and Hollywood blog and co-founder of the women-focused Athena Film Festival.  It's almost an exclamation point on what women have been saying for a long time - in the industry, outside the industry; that our stories matter, we are the heroes of the stories, we can kick butt as well as anyone else and we're equal,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. Wonder Woman was first imagined in 1941 as an icon of female empowerment - even appearing on the inaugural cover of the flagship feminist publication Ms. magazine three decades later. But her modern portrayal has been criticized for shifting to a sexualized buxom character, typically clad in a red, white and blue body suit. The United Nations dumped Wonder Woman less than two months after naming her as an ambassador for women's and girls' empowerment amid criticism that her pin-up image sent the wrong message. The film reverts to her original incarnation.  Wonder Woman  is one of three comic-book superheroes from the 1930s and 1940s whose stories have been published almost without interruption - alongside Batman and Superman - according to Harvard history professor Jill Lepore.  Yet, Jenkins' film is the first theatrical release starring the Princess of the Amazons. Her debut on the silver screen has prompted a host of celebratory initiatives. In New York,  Wonder Woman  enthusiasts have raised more than $8,000 in six days to send high-school girls to a screening in Washington D.C. And female-only showings by the cinema chain Alamo Drafthouse have sold out from Austin, Texas, to New York, with promises of proceeds going to Planned Parenthood, a women's healthcare provider. Silverstein said the blockbuster should herald a new era in a Hollywood film industry skewed in favor of male characters and filmmakers. Last year, females comprised just 29 percent of protagonists among the 100 top-grossing U.S. films, according to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, California. Behind the scenes, women made up just 7 percent of directors working on the top 250 domestic grossing films in 2016, a study by the same center shows.  The bigger picture is, for me, that women stories are as valid as male stories,  said Silverstein. Reporting by Sebastien Malo, Editing by Emma Batha.

Marko Perkovic Thompson, whose shows have been canceled in several European countries because of his unruly fans, has been invited by the Bosnian Croat leadership to take part in a concert on Thursday in honor of Croatian detainees at the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The concert in the southern Bosnian town of Mostar has been billed as supporting  all unjustly accused and convicted Croat defenders . It is widely viewed as a risky event in a town still split between Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks who fought each other during the violent 1992-95 breakup of Yugoslavia.  No action should be undertaken by anyone in Mostar or anywhere else that, as a consequence, deepens divisions or raises tensions,  representatives of major powers overseeing the implementation of Bosnia's peace process said in a statement. They called on institutions and organizations to  refrain from divisive events, actions and rhetoric, including glorification of convicted war criminals, historic revisionism and the provocative use of symbols . Thompson's songs glorify the Bosnian Croat wartime para-state Herzeg-Bosna and call for the killing of  Chetniks , an offensive name used for Serbs during the war. Several Bosniak political parties have also called for the concert to be canceled. Some Bosniak organizations said they would hold a counter-rally in the center of Mostar, though the city's mayor, Ljubo Beslic, a member of the Croat ruling HDZ party, said he would not allow this. The representatives of the major powers, meeting in Sarajevo, told the Bosnian Croat leaders sponsoring the concert that they were undermining European values and their stated desire to join the European Union through their stance. The powers overseeing the Bosnian peace accord include the United States, Russia, Germany, France, Britain and others.

The move would end Jackson National's nearly two decades of using Pimco's flagship Total Return investment strategy, although Jackson still offers the JNL/Pimco Income Fund and the JNL/Pimco Real Return Fund. The Jackson National introduced the JNL/Pimco Total Return Bond as a sub-account option in its variable annuity product line in 1998. The investment option is to be renamed the JNL/DoubleLine Core Fixed Income. The $3.5 billion mandate would considerably increase assets in portfolios run under DoubleLine's core-related fixed-income strategies. Core-type assets totaled $12 billion of $105 billion in assets under management at DoubleLine as of March 31. Pimco and DoubleLine declined to comment. Calls to Jackson National were not returned. It remains to be seen how many investors would stay once JNL/DoubleLine Core Fixed Income - an intermediate-term bond fund that invests in different sectors of the fixed-income markets, including corporate securities, emerging markets debt and MBS - gets up and running.  Legendary bond investor Bill Gross left Pimco in September 2014, eight months after second-in-command Mohamed El-Erian quit after the two clashed over how to run the Newport Beach, California-based Pimco. Gross now runs the $2 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund.   Institutional investors tend to be more patient than retail, but in the nearly three years since the Bill Gross departure from Pimco, the Total Return fund’s performance relative to its Lipper peers has stabilized,  said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research at CFRA.  However, fund assets remain significantly lower as the firm has not been able to win back investor attention. DoubleLine’s fixed income products have performed well under unchanged management over the last five years.       Although much smaller in asset size, the $8.8 billion DoubleLine Core Fixed Income Fund has been growing strongly whereas its much larger Pimco Total Return counterpart, with $73.8 billion in assets, has only recently shown signs of stabilization after outflows reduced its size to a quarter of its all-time high of $293 billion in mid-2003.

The move would end Jackson National's nearly two decades of using Pimco's flagship Total Return investment strategy, although Jackson still offers the JNL/Pimco Income Fund and the JNL/Pimco Real Return Fund. The Jackson National introduced the JNL/Pimco Total Return Bond as a sub-account option in its variable annuity product line in 1998. The investment option is to be renamed the JNL/DoubleLine Core Fixed Income. The $3.5 billion mandate would considerably increase assets in portfolios run under DoubleLine's core-related fixed-income strategies. Core-type assets totaled $12 billion of $105 billion in assets under management at DoubleLine as of March 31. Pimco and DoubleLine declined to comment. Calls to Jackson National were not returned. It remains to be seen how many investors would stay once JNL/DoubleLine Core Fixed Income - an intermediate-term bond fund that invests in different sectors of the fixed-income markets, including corporate securities, emerging markets debt and MBS - gets up and running.  Legendary bond investor Bill Gross left Pimco in September 2014, eight months after second-in-command Mohamed El-Erian quit after the two clashed over how to run the Newport Beach, California-based Pimco. Gross now runs the $2 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund.   Institutional investors tend to be more patient than retail, but in the nearly three years since the Bill Gross departure from Pimco, the Total Return fund’s performance relative to its Lipper peers has stabilized,  said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research at CFRA.  However, fund assets remain significantly lower as the firm has not been able to win back investor attention. DoubleLine’s fixed income products have performed well under unchanged management over the last five years.       Although much smaller in asset size, the $8.8 billion DoubleLine Core Fixed Income Fund has been growing strongly whereas its much larger Pimco Total Return counterpart, with $73.8 billion in assets, has only recently shown signs of stabilization after outflows reduced its size to a quarter of its all-time high of $293 billion in mid-2003.

It was the latest example of the tightrope that U.S. officials are walking as Trump's tweets raise questions about existing U.S. policy and the carefully scripted talking points used to explain it. In the case of Qatar, the stakes are high. More than 11,000 U.S. and coalition forces are deployed to or assigned to al Udeid Air Base, from which more than 100 aircraft operate. Of those 11,000, nearly 1,000 work in a combined air operations center that helps oversee missions for campaigns in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, the military says. U.S. officials had said on Monday that the United States would quietly try to calm the waters between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, arguing that the small Gulf state was too important to U.S. military and diplomatic interests to be isolated. But Trump, wading into the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades, said on Tuesday his trip to the Middle East was  already paying off  with leaders there taking a hard new line in accusing Qatar of funding of militant groups. The Pentagon, which seeks to steer clear of political matters, was unable to reconcile Trump's support for Qatar's isolation with its own praise for its commitment to regional security.  Asked directly about the disconnect, spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis told a news briefing:  I can't help you with that.   We continue to be grateful to the Qataris for their longstanding support for our presence and their enduring commitment to regional security,  Davis said, adding the United States had no plans to alter its presence in Qatar. The U.S. envoy to Qatar, Dana Shell Smith, retweeted on Monday a message from October in which she praised the U.S. partnership with Qatar, citing  real progress to counter terrorist financing.  U.S. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told a Senate committee on Tuesday she was not concerned about the U.S. air base in Qatar and added that U.S. operations continued without interruption. The Pentagon also declined to answer a question about whether Qatar supported terrorism, the accusation made by Arab states who appeared to now have the political backing of the U.S. president. Davis, sticking to U.S. military-related matters, said:  I’m not the right person to ask that. I consider them a host to our very important base at al Udeid.

Macron said during the presidential campaign that he planned to fast-track the pro-business legislation through use of executive decrees in a country where the high cost of hiring and firing is seen as a deterrent to investors, and where unemployment is near double-digits. Unions had urged the government to take more time to discuss reforms they fear would reduce cherished employment rights and make France more like Anglo-American style labour markets where workers enjoy less protection. But speaking after meeting unions, Macron's prime minister stuck to a plan to pass the reforms during the summer holiday lull, a period in which unions could struggle to mobilise protesters, and said he would not seek to please unions on all of their demands.  We won't agree on everything, but we must move forward,  Edouard Philippe, a former conservative mayor told a news conference.  It's both indispensable and urgent.  Macron's La Republique En Marche (LREM) party is on course to win a landslide majority in this month's legislative elections, opinion polls show. That should help the 39-year old president sweep aside resistance from left-wing lawmakers and could also limit public support for any trade union strike action aimed at derailing the measures. Strikes and a rebellion in parliament were two factors that hamstrung the previous government's attempts to introduce similar reforms. Macron was a minister in that government between 2014 and 2016 before he quit to launch his presidential bid. His progress reforming France's regulation-laden economy this time around will be closely watched by Germany, which wants its European Union partners to boost growth and jobs by implementing measures like the ones it introduced more than a decade ago. In a document released on Tuesday, the government broadly stuck to measures contained in Macron's campaign manifesto including the capping of compensation awards in unfair dismissal cases. Two of the biggest unions appeared willing to engage in talks with the governments.  I don't think the unions will want to make a snap judgement since we only just got this letter from the government,  Laurent Berger of the moderate CFDT union said on French TV. Although the more militant CGT union unsurprisingly said it disagreed with the reforms and called on workers to protest over the coming days and weeks, the smaller FO union said the reform plan contained both positive and negative points.  It could be that unions will let past some major parts of the labour code reform, which would be good initially,  Agnes Verdier-Molinie of the IFRAP free-market think-tank said.  But they may be going for a deal on the pension reform, which the government could easily backtrack on because nobody understands what was in this reform,  she said on Boursorama TV. Macron plans to tackle pension reform next year and has said he wanted to merge all 37 pension systems into one, including the generous ones enjoyed by workers at the state-owned EDF utility or SNCF railway company.

In the shadow of the 12th century Al Koutoubia mosque - also known as the Mosque of Booksellers - the bustling shops once specialized in handwritten manuscripts and religious texts. It is a business that has been passed down from generation to generation. Only 26 booksellers remain in Bab Doukkala on the edge of the old city. Their stocks include Arabic translations of Karl Marx, modern Moroccan cookbooks as well as centuries-old manuscripts of Islamic law, some of which sell for thousands of dollars.  Now they face eviction by authorities who plan to move them for the sixth time in 40 years as part of a city replanning project for Marrakech, a former imperial capital and home to some of Morocco's finest mosques, palaces and gardens. Many of the vendors believe they belong in Jamaa El Fna square inside the old historic medina. They had plied their trade in the popular tourist district for years before being kicked out to make way for food stalls decades ago.  The authorities want to maintain an image of Marrakech that... attracts tourists, like snake charmers and belly dancers,  said Bassam Aqdad, who inherited his shop from his father.  Jamaa El Fna has worldwide recognition as a UNESCO world heritage site... We are just as much a part of the square as everything else that remains there.  The uprooted booksellers were forced to settle in Bab Doukkala square on the outskirts of the old town about 10 years ago. The line of shops resemble a shantytown, with books packed among the dusty plastic sheeting and rusty metal frames. Bookseller Abdelaziz Ahlij holds a 100-year-old handwritten manuscript in his bookshop in Bab Doukkala in the city of Marrakech, Morocco May 13, 2017.Youssef BoudlalAuthorities are planning to tear down the Bab Doukkala souk and replace it with a public garden, according to locals.  This is 'hogra',  said Fettah Belkharchi, 66, using a colloquial term to describe the abuse of power and injustices. The word is commonly used in anti-government protests. Slideshow (3 Images)Interior ministry officials and local Marrakech authorities did not respond to calls seeking comment. Trying to form a united front, Omar Zouita, who was among the traders uprooted from Jamaa El Fna, established the  Association of Awareness.  But after two more similar bodies were established, some believe attempts are being made to split their ranks.  They don't want anyone defending booksellers here,  Aqdad said. Their trade has also suffered because of global trends. The popularity of the internet and digital versions of books have led to a steady decline in demand for printed materials. The industry has also had to contend with the low literacy rate that has been prevalent in the country for decades. It is only recently that literacy levels have started to improve, reaching 67.1 percent, according to UNICEF.  At the end of the day, all we have are our books,  says 36-year-old Mohammed Khayi.  When things get rough, we can pick up a book and forget everything else.

The move is part of the embattled socialist government's strategy to raise fresh funds to support the crisis-stricken economy by selling bonds, gold and shares in oil projects. A potential deal, coming on the back of a controversial sale of state oil company bonds to Goldman Sachs last month, would likely heighten opposition criticism that Wall Street is handing President Nicolas Maduro a lifeline amid a bruising economic crisis and major anti-government protests. The sovereign debt securities, held by state-owned Banco de Venezuela since their issuance in late 2016, were offered in early May to Goldman Sachs, but the U.S. bank rejected the deal, financial sources told Reuters.  Now they are being offered to funds in New York, instead of to large banks, with a discount of up to 80 percent,  said opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado, who tracks the negotiations between Nicolas Maduro's administration and Wall Street and was informed of the offer by sources in New York.  They're still holding fire sales,  he added, criticizing the potential deal with Maduro's cash-strapped administration. Opposition lawmakers, economists and lawyers have campaigned to cut off financing for Maduro, sending letters to the heads of 13 major banks and flagging the reputational risk of working with Caracas. But in May, Goldman Sachs and Nomura bought some $2.9 billion in bonds from Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, via intermediaries, and at a discount of up to 70 percent, the U.S. bank and sources close to the Japanese bank said. Banco de Venezuela is also seeking to sell its bonds through intermediaries, including Hong Kong-based Haitong Securities, which coordinated the physical issuance of the bonds in 2016, a New York-based financial source familiar with offers said.  Bonds similar to 2036 are in the market with (a price of) between 35 and 38 percent (of their original price),  said the source familiar with the talks.  But they are offering them at a 20 percent because the securities have not been dematerialized and require a bank with the infrastructure for that process.  Several analysts and traders believe that Venezuela has not been able to sell the bonds so far because they were issued physically and cannot be traded electronically. Banco de Venezuela and Haitong Securities did not immediately respond to a request for information from Reuters. In a potential worry hovering over these deals, White House officials told Reuters this month that the Trump administration is concerned about any action by U.S. companies that provides a financial boost to Venezuela's government.

Researchers examined data from 23 studies covering a total of more than 1.3 million pregnancies and found 47 percent of the time women gained more weight than recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) - about 25 to 35 pounds for people who start out pregnancy at a normal weight. Another 23 percent of the time, women didn’t gain enough weight.  Too little pregnancy weight gain was associated with a higher risk of undersized and premature infants, while too much weight gain was linked to greater odds of oversized babies and cesarean section, or surgical, deliveries, researchers report in JAMA.  “Women are rarely aware of healthy weight gain targets in pregnancy and are not generally weighed or supported to reach them,” said senior study author Dr. Helena Teede of Monash University in Victoria, Australia.  “This clearly needs to change,” Teede said by email. “Based on the study results both mothers and babies are healthier with less complications like cesarean sections and less small or large babies if weight gain is within targets.” Weight gain recommendations vary depending on women’s size when they become pregnant. Women who are underweight should gain 28 to 40 pounds, according to the IOM. For overweight women, a 15- to 25-pound gain is recommended and obese women should gain just 11 to 20 pounds. To see how often women were below, within or above recommended weight ranges for pregnancy, researchers assessed weight gains across all of the pregnancies based on women’s pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height. An adult who is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs from 125 to 168 pounds would have a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 and be considered a healthy weight, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An obese adult at that height would have a BMI of 30 or more and weigh at least 203 pounds. Compared with women whose weight gain fell within a range recommended by the IOM, women who added too few pounds during pregnancy were 70 percent more likely to have premature deliveries and 53 percent more likely to have babies that were small for their gestational age, the study found.  Too little weight gain didn’t appear to influence their risk of a cesarean section, and it was linked to lower odds of having overweight babies or infants whose shoulders got stuck in the birth canal during delivery.  But compared with women who gained a recommended amount of weight, women who added too many pounds were 85 percent more likely to have babies that were large for their gestational age and 30 percent more likely to have cesarean deliveries.  The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how the amount of pregnancy weight gain influences specific health outcomes for mothers or babies.  Another limitation is that the individual studies had inconsistent definitions for certain outcomes like underweight or overweight infants or preterm deliveries, the authors note. Researchers could not always distinguish, for example, between a scheduled or elective cesarean delivery and an emergency surgery, and they couldn’t tell when preterm births occurred naturally or were induced.  The analysis also included studies published both before and after the IOM weight gain guidelines came out in 2009, and weight gain targets may have differed across the studies, the authors point out.  Even so, the findings confirm and strengthen results from many smaller studies suggesting that many women gain more than the recommended amount of weight during pregnancy, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland and author of an accompanying editorial.  “Even in individuals who might normally eat reasonable amounts, the hormones of pregnancy often lead to greater food consumption,” Caughey said by email. “Because of this ready availability of high caloric foods, it is easy to gain too much weight, which is the most common outcome.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2sPc0qS and bit.ly/2qXSpIR JAMA, online June 6, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pregnancy-weight-gain-idUSKBN18X2G6"},

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.  A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday:  We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.   We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,  the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible. The spokesman said the company, which is the world's biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.  Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.  Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades. Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.  The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.       Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

It was only when the Qatari foreign ministry released a statement saying it was facing a campaign of lies and fabrications aimed at putting the Gulf Arab state under guardianship that the channel came to life on the topic.  This has been planned since 2014 but only came out after the Riyadh summit,  said Mohamed al-Mosfer, one of the many Qatari analysts the channel had on to comment, referring to a meeting last month attended by U.S. President Donald Trump. The Arab world's strongest powers cut ties with Qatar on Monday over alleged support for Islamists and Iran. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain coordinated their move, while Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government, and the Maldives joined in later. Al Jazeera did not focus on the statements and comments coming out of those countries, instead giving air time to the U.S. and Turkish foreign ministers and an adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani -- all urging dialogue. The channel is at the center of the controversy. Arab rulers accuse Qatar of using its multi-million-dollar franchise as a mouthpiece to attack them. Local media in the countries that cut ties speculated it would be shut down in an effort by Qatar to appease its angry neighbors, but while journalists working there are rattled by the crisis, they think their station will survive.  Everybody is shocked at the escalation but no one thinks the channel will close, said one journalist with Al Jazeera English.  It is something the Qataris will not give up.  Later that night Al Jazeera focused on news coming out of Washington indicating Trump wanted to see the Gulf rift healed, as well as Kremlin statements calling for unity in the fight against militancy. A White House statement saying Trump would work to smooth things over between Arab Gulf states played for over an hour on Al Jazeera screens. Saudi and Emirati channels ignored it. When a senior Trump administration official told Reuters several of Qatar's actions worried its Gulf neighbors, Al Jazeera disregarded it. Other Gulf channels gave it prominence. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Al Jazeera Media Network is seen during the annual MIPCOM television programme market in Cannes, France, October 17, 2016.Eric Gaillard/File PhotoInfluence and Enemies The channel cheered on the 2011 Arab Spring revolts, particularly in Egypt, but now faces aggressive competition in its home region, and suspicion from many governments over air time given to Islamist groups in Syria, Libya and elsewhere. Al Jazeera's spectacular growth took place under former Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani who, unlike other Gulf Arab leaders, backed Middle East protest movements and played mediator in a host of wars.  Under his son and current ruler Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Qatar has toned down its foreign policy. Founded in 1996 as part of Qatari efforts to turn economic power into political influence, Al Jazeera offered free-wheeling, uncensored debate of a kind rarely seen on Arab televisions. Its talk shows hosted guests who challenged the wisdom of Arab rulers and adopted the role of supporter of the dispossessed. Reporters broke with a widespread taboo of the Arab news media by interviewing Israeli officials. Funded by Qatar's royal family, Wadah Khanfar, a Palestinian journalist who was director general of the network between 2006-2011, helped turn the Arab satellite channel into a world network with millions of viewers and more than 20 channels broadcasting in languages including Arabic, English and Swahili. With Al Jazeera's expansion came unprecedented influence in the Arab world, but also new enemies. Egypt views Al Jazeera as critical of its government, and the channel has been banned there since 2013. Al Jazeera says it is an independent news service giving a voice to everyone in the region.  Egyptian security forces have arrested several of its reporters and last year a Cairo court recommended the death penalty for two of them, charged in absentia with endangering national security by leaking state secrets to Qatar.  Three others had previously been sentenced to between seven and 10 years in jail on charges including spreading lies to help a  terrorist organization  -- a reference to the banned Muslim Brotherhood -- but were later freed. Saudi Arabia shut down the channel on Monday.  Al Jazeera condemns the measures taken by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Culture and Information to close the Al Jazeera Media Network's office and withdraw the operating license,  said a spokesman in Qatar.

It was the latest example of the tightrope that U.S. officials are walking as Trump's tweets raise questions about existing U.S. policy and the carefully scripted talking points used to explain it. In the case of Qatar, the stakes are high. More than 11,000 U.S. and coalition forces are deployed to or assigned to al Udeid Air Base, from which more than 100 aircraft operate. Of those 11,000, nearly 1,000 work in a combined air operations center that helps oversee missions for campaigns in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, the military says. U.S. officials had said on Monday that the United States would quietly try to calm the waters between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, arguing that the small Gulf state was too important to U.S. military and diplomatic interests to be isolated. But Trump, wading into the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades, said on Tuesday his trip to the Middle East was  already paying off  with leaders there taking a hard new line in accusing Qatar of funding of militant groups. The Pentagon, which seeks to steer clear of political matters, was unable to reconcile Trump's support for Qatar's isolation with its own praise for its commitment to regional security.  Asked directly about the disconnect, spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis told a news briefing:  I can't help you with that.   We continue to be grateful to the Qataris for their longstanding support for our presence and their enduring commitment to regional security,  Davis said, adding the United States had no plans to alter its presence in Qatar. The U.S. envoy to Qatar, Dana Shell Smith, retweeted on Monday a message from October in which she praised the U.S. partnership with Qatar, citing  real progress to counter terrorist financing.  U.S. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told a Senate committee on Tuesday she was not concerned about the U.S. air base in Qatar and added that U.S. operations continued without interruption. The Pentagon also declined to answer a question about whether Qatar supported terrorism, the accusation made by Arab states who appeared to now have the political backing of the U.S. president. Davis, sticking to U.S. military-related matters, said:  I’m not the right person to ask that. I consider them a host to our very important base at al Udeid.

Slovenia had committed to sell 50 percent of NLB this year and another 25 percent in 2018 in exchange for the European Commission's approval of state aid for the bank in 2013. Privatisation coordinator Slovenian Sovereign Holding asked the government last week to set the price range for the planned initial public offering of NLB but Erjavec said he expected the government to decide against going forward with the sale at its session on Thursday.  I believe the process of the sale will probably not continue,  Erjavec told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of the governing coalition. Erjavec, whose Desus party is a junior member of the coalition, signalled that he believed that the price likely to be achieved in the NLB sale was too low.  The standpoint of Desus party is that the sale could go through if the price was right, if taxpayers would be repaid and if we would also earn something,  he said. Erjavec had said previously that the sale should bring in at least 1.55 billion euros ($1.75 billion) - the size of the state capital increase for NLB in 2013 - but analysts believe Slovenia could at most get some 1 billion euros for the whole bank. The European Commission has not revealed what steps it would take if Slovenia failed to sell NLB but a Commission spokesperson told Reuters that the EU executive was in contact with Slovenian authorities. Slovenia has been reluctant to sell its major banks over the past decades so the government still controls about 45 percent of the banking sector.

The officials filed a legal brief with the Supreme Court as it mulls whether to take up the Trump administration's appeal of lower court rulings blocking the travel ban signed by the Republican president on March 6 and let it go into effect. In the states' brief, filed on Monday, Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller wrote that the executive order does not mention religion at all and distinguishes people based only on nationality.  The executive order therefore is emphatically not a 'Muslim ban,'  Keller wrote. Keller added that courts should be careful when second-guessing a president's national security determinations, an argument that echoes the administration's view that the judiciary should defer to the president on such matters. The brief said the order did not violation the Constitution's ban on the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion or its guarantee of due process. The filing came after the administration asked the high court last Thursday to allow the order to take effect. [nL1N1IZ03Q] Aside from Texas, the officials were Republican state attorneys general from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia, as well as Mississippi's Republican governor. Three Republican attorneys general came from states with Democratic governors: Louisiana, Montana and West Virginia. Most of the states had also backed Trump earlier in the litigation. Many Democratic state officials have opposed the ban in lower courts. The high court is due to review legal papers filed by the ban's challengers, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, before acting. The briefs are due on Monday. A key issue before the justices in whether Trump's comments during the 2016 president campaign, including calling for  a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,  can be used as evidence that his order was intended to discriminate against Muslims.  The administration filed emergency applications with the justices seeking to block lower court rulings that went against Trump's order barring entry for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the U.S. government implements stricter visa screening. Trump's order also called for suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days. The move comes after the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on May 25 upheld a Maryland judge's ruling blocking the order. [nL1N1IR1FY]  Potentially making it harder for his lawyers to win at the Supreme Court, Trump again commented on the case on Monday, tweeting complaints that his own administration had issued a  watered down, politically correct version  of an earlier order he signed on Jan. 27 that also was blocked by courts.

Oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] in March resumed exports of Mesa 30 to Cuba after an eight-month pause. It has shipped between 850,000 barrels and 1.4 million barrels per month to the Caribbean island since then, documents show. Mesa 30 - one of Venezuela's lightest crudes - is used by PDVSA and its partners to dilute the extra heavy oil produced in the vast Orinoco Belt and to feed several domestic refineries. But with its oil output falling, the company is struggling to satisfy its domestic network and its foreign clients, according to internal sources and reports.  Diverting crude is one of the causes of the refinery's status, but there is also lack of maintenance,  said Jose Bodas, a union leader at Puerto la Cruz who last month warned about the facility's low processing. Workers in May failed to restart Puerto la Cruz's catalytic cracker due to lack of spare parts, Bodas added.     Only one of Puerto la Cruz's three crude distillation units is working after the refinery partially resumed operations last week, a worker from the facility told Reuters. The refinery is producing about 29,500 bpd of gasoline, diesel and residual fuels, another worker said. Venezuela's refining network has been running at historic lows this quarter, causing intermittent gasoline shortages in the OPEC-member country and in Cuba. Only PDVSA's smallest refinery, the 146,000-bpd El Palito, has increased output since April. Unpaid Crude for Isla The 335,000-bpd Isla refinery in Curacao, which PDVSA uses as an auxiliary facility, also has struggled to increase output since one of its four crude distillation units suffered serious damage during a fire two weeks ago.  Isla is putting its thermal cracker unit in service to be used for crude distillation... so it can process 40 percent of the crude bound for the crude distillation unit number 3,  the refinery said in a statement late on Monday. The refinery also will process heavy crude at its distillation unit number two, it added. Isla produces fuel oil for export, mainly for delivery to Chinese firms as payment for loans to Venezuela. The fire has contributed to PDVSA's low fuel oil shipments, which this year average 60,000 bpd versus 165,000 bpd in 2016, according to the data.   Two 500,000-barrel cargoes of British BP supplied U.S. light sweet crude arrived in Curacao's Bullenbay terminal in May to feed Isla's since damaged crude unit. PDVSA is considering diverting the oil to its Amuay refinery on Venezuela's western coast, one of the internal documents says.

She and her team measured several markers of lung function in 2,308 adults who lived in 12 villages near, but not on, farms in the Netherlands, which has one of the world’s highest population densities as well as one of the highest livestock farm densities.  The more livestock farms that were near participants' homes - within 1,000 meters, or six-tenths of a mile - the more impairments researchers found in how participants expelled air when they exhaled.  The study also showed that neighboring residents’ lung function was reduced during weeks with higher levels of farm-related ammonia air pollution, Smit said. The effects on breathing patterns were small but significant, she said. Prior studies have shown that livestock farms contain high levels of dust, which can lead to respiratory problems in farm workers, the authors write in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. Livestock farms also emit ammonia, an irritant gas formed by enzymes in animal waste. When ammonia reacts with other gases, it forms fine dust particles, Smit said. Dr. Daniel Jackson, a pediatrician and professor at University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, said the study highlights how public policy can impact individual health. “Decisions that can lead to worsening air quality can have very significant impacts on health,” said Jackson, who was not involved with the study. “This paper highlights one potential exposure that can have an impact on respiratory health,” he said in a phone interview. He noted that the neighbors who appeared to be the most affected by farm pollution were those who had chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, which inflame the airways. These conditions include emphysema, chronic bronchitis and asthma. Jackson said the findings would not prompt him to recommend that people living near large-scale farms consider moving, however.  “People should be aware of these exposures, and if they’re having respiratory symptoms associated with these sorts of exposures, it’s something to look into and have further evaluated,” he said. The study appears at first glance to contradict a growing body of research that suggests children who grow up on farms may be at reduced risk of allergies and asthma, Jackson said. But Smit said studies of children on farms have focused on smaller operations. “There are also benefits from a farm environment,” she said. “But it depends on what kind of farms and pollution you’re looking at.” Farms with 1,000 pigs, for example, create a completely different environment for children than a small family farm.  The factory farms “are emitting large-scale pollutants and dust,” she said. “Children are not going to play on these pig farms.” Last week, government regulators in the Netherlands ordered poultry farmers to cut dust emissions by half over the next 10 years, she said.  “Farmers know something needs to be done to reduce pollution and the risks,” Smit said. “It’s very important to have a dialogue with farmers and the community.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2qxUGWP American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, online May 10, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-farms-neighbors-idUSKBN18X2E4"},

It was only when the Qatari foreign ministry released a statement saying it was facing a campaign of lies and fabrications aimed at putting the Gulf Arab state under guardianship that the channel came to life on the topic.  This has been planned since 2014 but only came out after the Riyadh summit,  said Mohamed al-Mosfer, one of the many Qatari analysts the channel had on to comment, referring to a meeting last month attended by U.S. President Donald Trump. The Arab world's strongest powers cut ties with Qatar on Monday over alleged support for Islamists and Iran. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain coordinated their move, while Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government, and the Maldives joined in later. Al Jazeera did not focus on the statements and comments coming out of those countries, instead giving air time to the U.S. and Turkish foreign ministers and an adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani -- all urging dialogue. The channel is at the center of the controversy. Arab rulers accuse Qatar of using its multi-million-dollar franchise as a mouthpiece to attack them. Local media in the countries that cut ties speculated it would be shut down in an effort by Qatar to appease its angry neighbors, but while journalists working there are rattled by the crisis, they think their station will survive.  Everybody is shocked at the escalation but no one thinks the channel will close, said one journalist with Al Jazeera English.  It is something the Qataris will not give up.  Later that night Al Jazeera focused on news coming out of Washington indicating Trump wanted to see the Gulf rift healed, as well as Kremlin statements calling for unity in the fight against militancy. A White House statement saying Trump would work to smooth things over between Arab Gulf states played for over an hour on Al Jazeera screens. Saudi and Emirati channels ignored it. When a senior Trump administration official told Reuters several of Qatar's actions worried its Gulf neighbors, Al Jazeera disregarded it. Other Gulf channels gave it prominence. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Al Jazeera Media Network is seen during the annual MIPCOM television programme market in Cannes, France, October 17, 2016.Eric Gaillard/File PhotoInfluence and Enemies The channel cheered on the 2011 Arab Spring revolts, particularly in Egypt, but now faces aggressive competition in its home region, and suspicion from many governments over air time given to Islamist groups in Syria, Libya and elsewhere. Al Jazeera's spectacular growth took place under former Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani who, unlike other Gulf Arab leaders, backed Middle East protest movements and played mediator in a host of wars.  Under his son and current ruler Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Qatar has toned down its foreign policy. Founded in 1996 as part of Qatari efforts to turn economic power into political influence, Al Jazeera offered free-wheeling, uncensored debate of a kind rarely seen on Arab televisions. Its talk shows hosted guests who challenged the wisdom of Arab rulers and adopted the role of supporter of the dispossessed. Reporters broke with a widespread taboo of the Arab news media by interviewing Israeli officials. Funded by Qatar's royal family, Wadah Khanfar, a Palestinian journalist who was director general of the network between 2006-2011, helped turn the Arab satellite channel into a world network with millions of viewers and more than 20 channels broadcasting in languages including Arabic, English and Swahili. With Al Jazeera's expansion came unprecedented influence in the Arab world, but also new enemies. Egypt views Al Jazeera as critical of its government, and the channel has been banned there since 2013. Al Jazeera says it is an independent news service giving a voice to everyone in the region.  Egyptian security forces have arrested several of its reporters and last year a Cairo court recommended the death penalty for two of them, charged in absentia with endangering national security by leaking state secrets to Qatar.  Three others had previously been sentenced to between seven and 10 years in jail on charges including spreading lies to help a  terrorist organization  -- a reference to the banned Muslim Brotherhood -- but were later freed. Saudi Arabia shut down the channel on Monday.  Al Jazeera condemns the measures taken by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Culture and Information to close the Al Jazeera Media Network's office and withdraw the operating license,  said a spokesman in Qatar.

Oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] in March resumed exports of Mesa 30 to Cuba after an eight-month pause. It has shipped between 850,000 barrels and 1.4 million barrels per month to the Caribbean island since then, documents show. Mesa 30 - one of Venezuela's lightest crudes - is used by PDVSA and its partners to dilute the extra heavy oil produced in the vast Orinoco Belt and to feed several domestic refineries. But with its oil output falling, the company is struggling to satisfy its domestic network and its foreign clients, according to internal sources and reports.  Diverting crude is one of the causes of the refinery's status, but there is also lack of maintenance,  said Jose Bodas, a union leader at Puerto la Cruz who last month warned about the facility's low processing. Workers in May failed to restart Puerto la Cruz's catalytic cracker due to lack of spare parts, Bodas added.     Only one of Puerto la Cruz's three crude distillation units is working after the refinery partially resumed operations last week, a worker from the facility told Reuters. The refinery is producing about 29,500 bpd of gasoline, diesel and residual fuels, another worker said. Venezuela's refining network has been running at historic lows this quarter, causing intermittent gasoline shortages in the OPEC-member country and in Cuba. Only PDVSA's smallest refinery, the 146,000-bpd El Palito, has increased output since April. Unpaid Crude for Isla The 335,000-bpd Isla refinery in Curacao, which PDVSA uses as an auxiliary facility, also has struggled to increase output since one of its four crude distillation units suffered serious damage during a fire two weeks ago.  Isla is putting its thermal cracker unit in service to be used for crude distillation... so it can process 40 percent of the crude bound for the crude distillation unit number 3,  the refinery said in a statement late on Monday. The refinery also will process heavy crude at its distillation unit number two, it added. Isla produces fuel oil for export, mainly for delivery to Chinese firms as payment for loans to Venezuela. The fire has contributed to PDVSA's low fuel oil shipments, which this year average 60,000 bpd versus 165,000 bpd in 2016, according to the data.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.  A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday:  We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.   We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,  the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible. The spokesman said the company, which is the world's biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.  Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.  Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades. Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.  The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.       Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar.

The Maduro government calls the protesters violent coup-mongers, supported by the United States.  This is an economic, political and humanitarian crisis that demands the world's attention,  Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told a U.S.-hosted panel of Venezuelan activists and experts held on the sidelines of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.  The Venezuelan government is in the midst of destroying human rights and democracy in Venezuela. It is conducting a campaign of violence and intimidation against unarmed demonstrators, businesses, civil society and freely elected political opposition,  she said. But Jorge Valero, Venezuela ambassador, told the Council that Venezuelans enjoyed fundamental freedoms, adding:  This (U.S.) government has no moral authority to set itself up as a universal judge of human rights.   Turning Into a Dictatorship  Haley, speaking later at the Graduate Institute in Geneva, said states must prevent human rights crises from becoming armed conflicts.  It's the reason why I am so concerned about Venezuela. Because in Venezuela, (one is) hard-pressed to see that Maduro is not following in the same steps as Assad. We have to make sure we stop it before it gets to that point,  she said.

They are being treated as a form of prisoners of war,  Alonso Medina Roa of Penal Reform, which is providing legal defense to hundreds, told the event. Maduro's foes are demanding general elections, freedom for jailed activists, humanitarian aid, and autonomy for the opposition-controlled National Assembly. In May, Maduro announced a plan for a  constituent assembly  with powers to rewrite the constitution, in what he says is a bid to bring back peace. But opponents say he is seeking to dodge national elections and has ignored demands for an end to crushing food and medicine shortages.  The Venezuela regime is fooling no one. Recognizing that its grip on power has slipped, it is yet again trying to change the rules of the game,  Haley said.  There are many things that could be done to help the people of Venezuela. But they really only need one thing: a free election.  Venezuela ranks last in Latin America for transparency, said Mercedes de Freitas, executive director of the Venezuela chapter of Transparency International.

The soldiers, who include colonels and captains, are being held in Ramo Verde prison in the hills outside Caracas, according to lists being circulated within the military.  The documents said their cases were being  processed , and it was not clear if they had been formally charged.  The lists emerged after allegations by Venezuelan opposition leaders that a purge is underway within the military to quash dissent over the handling of massive demonstrations against the socialist government since early April. The documents seen by Reuters only went up to April 8, after which the opposition and rights activists say scores more soldiers have been rounded up. The military's National Guard unit has been at the forefront of policing the protests, using tear gas, water cannons, and rubber bullets against masked youths who hurl stones, Molotov cocktails and excrement against security lines. At least 65 people have died, with victims including government and opposition supporters, bystanders and members of the security forces. Hundreds more have been injured. In public, top military officers have backed Maduro's accusation that an  armed insurrection  is being mounted by violent conspirators seeking a coup with U.S. backing. But opposition leaders say there is increasing disquiet within the military over the use of force against protesters who are demanding general elections, foreign humanitarian aid and freedom for jailed activists. Capriles Says 100 Held One prominent opposition leader, Henrique Capriles, said he had been told by contacts within the armed forces that more than 100 soldiers had been held, most at Ramo Verde jail or military intelligence headquarters in Caracas' Boleita district.

The Short-Term IDR has also been affirmed at 'F2'. Fitch has also affirmed the senior unsecured rating of Global Switch Property (Australia) Pty Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary, at 'BBB+'. The Outlook is Stable. Global Switch's cash flow continues to be resilient, driven by a geographically diverse portfolio of large-scale data centres that generate stable, contractual rental income. The company maintains a conservative capital structure with net debt/EBITDA below 4x at 31 December 2016, although owing to substantial development, we forecast this to increase to around 5x by 2018, before falling back below 4x. On 1 June 2017, Global Switch issued EUR500 million of 1.5% notes due January 2024 and EUR500 million of 2.25% notes due May 2027 to fund development, refinance bonds due in 2018 and lower the cost of debt. KEY RATING DRIVERS New Ownership Structure: The acquisition of 49% of Global Switch from Aldersgate Investments Ltd. by a consortium of Chinese investors in December 2016 is credit-neutral. Aldersgate Investments Ltd. retains 51%. The new shareholders should support portfolio diversification and development, particularly in accessing telecommunications and internet providers expanding outside of China. The company is now jointly controlled by the consortium's investment vehicle, Elegant Jubilee Limited, and Aldersgate. The shareholders have entered into a shareholders agreement that regulates operational and financial policies and defines a dividend policy, and have confirmed their support to maintain a strong investment-grade rating. Management remains unchanged. Decreasing Lease Length: At 31 December 2016, the average remaining lease maturity of the top 20 customers decreased to a short 4.1 years compared with 4.3 the year before. Nevertheless, developments coming on line will increase the average lease maturity to five years, retention rates have historically been very high and developments have a high percentage of pre-lets. Global Switch, which holds a joint marketing agreement with Chinese data centre operator Daily-Tech, recently signed significant new contracts in Hong Kong and Singapore with Daily-Tech, with China Telecom Global as the end customer in Hong Kong. Development to Support Growth: Global Switch is developing or expanding sites in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Sydney, Singapore and Hong Kong at an estimated total cost of over GBP900 million over the next three years (GBP180 million is already committed). The company mitigates construction risk by requiring high pre-commitments before beginning construction, staging and phasing the build schedule to meet revenue generation, passing design and construction risks to contractors and obtaining protections such as bank and parent company guarantees, liquidated damages in case of delays, and step-in rights in the case of end customers. Temporarily Increasing Leverage: Global Switch's net debt/EBITDA of below 4x at end-2016 and loan-to-value (LTV) of around 20% compare favourably with Fitch-rated investment grade real estate peers, whose metrics average 8x net debt/EBITDA and 40% LTV. Low debt levels mitigate the slightly higher operating risk of Global Switch compared with other similarly rated commercial real estate companies. The company's closest rated peer is Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (BBB/Stable), a larger, US-focused data centre company, but with leverage typically at around 5.0x. Portfolio of Prime Data Centres: Global Switch's portfolio comprises 10 high-specification, large-scale, carrier and cloud-neutral, multi-tenanted data centres, which are valued at GBP4.95 billion and located near key business and telecommunication hubs across seven European and Asian countries. The assets benefit from uninterruptible power supplies, high security, and resilient cooling systems and have a strong operating history. Fitch believes data centres should benefit from medium-term growth generated by increasing global internet traffic, higher bandwidth needs, outsourcing trends and the development of cloud computing. Tenant Concentration: Although Global Switch has approximately 1,200 contracts with over 350 tenants, the top 20 clients generate around two-thirds of rental income with the largest representing 10.7%. Most of the top 20 tenants, however, are investment-grade companies and over 80% of annualised lease revenue is derived from customers present in multiple Global Switch data centres. Niche Asset Class: The data centres are specialised properties operating in a niche sector with potential long-term technological obsolescence, but also with significant barriers to entry and favourable medium-term trends. While financial metrics are consistent with an 'A' category, Global Switch's ratings are constrained by data centre properties being a less mature asset class compared with other real estate assets, a rather illiquid trading market for the properties, and the potential for rapid technological development rendering the assets obsolete, although this is a relatively low, long-term risk. DERIVATION SUMMARY Global Switch generates resilient cash flows from a geographically diverse portfolio and maintains financial metrics consistent with the 'A' category. The capital structure is conservative with net debt/EBITDA of below 4x at 31 December 2016, although we forecast this to increase to around 5x by 2018, owing to funding for developments. Levels should return to under 4x by 2020. Global Switch has lower leverage and greater geographic diversity than most Fitch-rated real estate peers with similar ratings. Global Switch operates in a relatively new, niche market that features lower liquidity compared with other real estate sectors, limiting the ability to divest properties in a distressed scenario. The market carries long-term technological obsolescence risk. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Most expiring leases are either renewed or replaced with new tenants leading to a flat occupancy ratio (excl. redevelopment); - Some developments and extensions driving top line-growth (mainly Hong Kong). RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Given the niche asset class Global Switch is operating in, Fitch currently views an upgrade as unlikely. Negative: Future events that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: -Aggressive committed development capex, beyond the current pipeline, not covered by existing liquidity; -Significant deterioration of the average lease length or vacancies or renewals/new leases made at large discounts; -EBITDA net interest cover below 3.5x (2015: 4.9x) on a sustained basis; -Leverage above 4.5x net debt/EBITDA on a sustained basis; -A material increase in secured debt at the expense of unsecured bond holders. LIQUIDITY Global Switch has solid liquidity with no short-term refinancing pressure. In February, the company signed a new GBP425 million facility and on 1 June 2017 raised EUR1 billion of long-dated bonds through its EMTN programme. Proceeds from the bonds will largely fund new development capital expenditure and repay EUR600 million unsecured notes due in April 2018.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said achieving universal health coverage would be a  top priority  during his five-year term as head of the Geneva-based U.N. agency.  Globally an estimated 400 million, approximately 1 in 17 people, lack access to essential health services, that's unacceptable,  Tedros, as he is known, said via video-link, joining a panel debate on Tuesday at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. Universal health coverage is based on the principle that everyone should receive the health services they need without suffering financial hardship, according to the WHO. Millions of people in developing countries are tipped into poverty each year because of having to pay healthcare bills. France and Japan have mature universal health systems in place while others such as Ghana, Peru and Vietnam are in the early phases of setting them up, according to 2016 research by the Lancet medical journal.  Tedros, a former Ethiopian health minister, has replaced Margaret Chan, who left a mixed legacy after her 10 years on the job, especially because of WHO's slow response to West Africa's Ebola epidemic in 2013-2016, which killed 11,300 people. Far from being bankrupted, countries would feel significant economic and social benefits if they adopted universal health coverage, said Nobel Prize winning economist, Amartya Sen, also on the panel. Citing the example of Kerala, which took up the policy in the 1950s when it was the poorest state in India, Sen said the life expectancy for its inhabitants not only   shot up  but it was now one of the richest states in the country, in part due to its investment in healthcare.  Health is central to development ... it does something dramatically good to economic development,  he said. Reporting by Adela Suliman; editing by Ros Russell.

Mendillo,Jason Schloetzer,Leo J. Hindery,Mary Barra,Mary T. Barra,Michael G. Mullen,Warren E. Buffett,William N. Thorndike,US,GM,GREENLIGHT,United States","sector":"Unknown","content":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) shareholders on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected proposals by hedge fund Greenlight Capital to restructure the company's stock and reshape its board, backing Chief Executive Mary Barra's efforts to rev up the company's stalled share price. Fending off the challenge from Greenlight founder David Einhorn does not mean the end of Barra's battles. GM shares traded on Tuesday at $34.25, about 16 percent lower than when Barra became CEO, despite robust profits and a series of moves to sell or shut down money losing operations. The win also does not mean pressure will let up from Greenlight, which is the fifth largest shareholder, and while gracious in defeat, continued to make the case for fresh faces on the board.  We are disappointed that shareholders have elected to maintain the status quo,  Einhorn said in a statement on Tuesday.  We congratulate GM’s management on their win today.  Greenlight's campaign came as U.S. auto industry sales of new vehicles have begun to wane after a boom cycle that has lasted since 2010. Silicon Valley electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) this year surpassed GM's market value, reflecting investor confidence that, despite heavy losses, Tesla has a better strategy as the auto industry shifts to ride services and electric, autonomous vehicles. In comments before Tuesday's shareholder meeting, Barra acknowledged Greenlight's position on its stock price, saying  we do believe GM stock is undervalued,  and said the company  is continually looking at ideas  to increase investor interest.  Preliminary results showed more than 91 percent of shareholders voted against Greenlight's proposal to have GM offer dividend and capital appreciation shares, according to GM officials at the meeting. General Motors CEO Mary Barra addresses the media ahead of the start of GM's annual shareholders meeting at the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., June 6, 2017.Rebecca CookGM's board nominees were elected with between 84 percent and 99 percent of the vote, the company said. The board will remain the same at 11 members, with Barra as chairman. Einhorn floated the dual-class proposal in March, saying it could boost the automaker's $52-billion market capitalization by as much as $38 billion.  Greenlight, which owns a 3.6 percent stake in GM, later nominated three directors for the company's board: Leo Hindery, who served as CEO for five telecommunications and media companies, including AT&T; Broadband and Liberty Media; Vinit Sethi, Greenlight's director of research and William Thorndike, founder Housatonic Partners and the chairman of Consol Energy. Slideshow (4 Images)Greenlight hoped to replace three incumbent directors: Jane Mendillo, Michael Mullen and Carol Stephenson. But Einhorn's pitch flopped with debt rating agencies and proxy advisers and he failed to rally other shareholders to his cause. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), which holds a 3.3 percent stake in GM, remained silent on the proposal. Einhorn added in Tuesday's statement that GM should still consider Hindery and Thorndike for the board.  Greenlight is a multi-strategy hedge fund that has taken on other corporate giants such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), but whose last activist proxy contest was more than 10 years ago.  Jason Schloetzer, professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business, said Greenlight's loss is not a major blow to the roughly $10 billion hedge fund and time will tell if its stake earns the kind of returns Einhorn hopes to reap.  While Greenlight would have liked to have increased their influence over GM’s financial management, it's unfair to conclude from today's vote that the fund will not be successful in its investment over the medium term,  Schloetzer said.

Heavy water, a moderator used in a type of reactor that can produce plutonium, is not the most sensitive part of Iran's nuclear program. But Tehran's stock of it is restricted to 130 tonnes under its 2015 deal with the major powers. Iran has already breached that limit twice since the deal imposed restrictions on its nuclear activities in January last year, when sanctions against Tehran were also lifted under the agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the agreement  the worst deal ever negotiated  and Washington strongly criticized Iran when it breached its heavy water limit last year. The deal calls for Iran's excess heavy water to be sold to a foreign buyer. Washington and its allies have accepted that it be shipped to Oman while a buyer is sought, which is what Iran did last year.  Twenty metric tonnes of its stock of heavy water will be transferred out of the country,  said one official who attended an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) meeting at which the U.N. watchdog said Tehran had informed it of the plan on Tuesday. The IAEA did not specify where the heavy water would be transferred to or when that would happen, but it said it would be soon, three officials who attended the meeting said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. There was no mention of a buyer. A quarterly IAEA report on Iran on Friday said Tehran's stock of heavy water had reached 128.2 tonnes, which a senior diplomat described as  very high .   Iran's heavy water production plant has been closed for maintenance since May 16. It is not clear when it will restart, but once it does Iran could reach the 130 tonne limit within about six weeks, the senior official said on Friday.  For sure, when it comes back online something needs to be done within a few weeks' time (to stay within the cap),  he said. That now appears to be happening, the officials said after Tuesday's briefing by the IAEA, which is in charge of policing the restrictions the deal placed on Iran's nuclear activities. The United States said in April that Iran was in compliance with the deal but it has also launched a wider policy review on how to deal with the Islamic Republic.

SDF spokesman Talal Silo told Reuters the battle started on Monday and the fighting would be fierce  because Daesh (Islamic State) will die to defend their so-called capital . The assault overlaps with the final stages of the U.S.-backed attack to recapture the Iraqi city of Mosul from Islamic State. It follows months of advances to the north, east and west of Raqqa by the SDF, which includes Arab and Kurdish militias. Islamic State captured Raqqa from rebel groups in 2014 and has used it as an operations base to plan attacks in the West. Silo said the assault had begun from the north, east and west of the city, which is bordered to the south by the River Euphrates. The commander of the Raqqa campaign, Rojda Felat, told Reuters SDF fighters were attacking the al-Mishlab district at the city's southeastern outskirts, confirming an earlier report by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.   The coalition has a big role in the success of the operations. In addition to warplanes, there are coalition forces working side by side with the SDF,  Silo said by phone from the Hukoumiya farms area, 10 km (6 miles) north of Raqqa, where the SDF later declared the start of the assault. A Reuters witness at the location could hear the sound of heavy shelling and air strikes in the distance. The U.S.-led coalition said the fight for Raqqa would be  long and difficult  but would deliver a  decisive blow to the idea of ISIS (Islamic State) as a physical caliphate . Hard Fighting  It's hard to convince new recruits that ISIS is a winning cause when they just lost their twin 'capitals' in both Iraq and Syria,  Lt. Gen Steve Townsend, the coalition commanding general, said in a coalition statement.   We all saw the heinous attack in Manchester, England,  said Townsend.  ISIS threatens all of our nations, not just Iraq and Syria, but in our own homelands as well. This cannot stand.   Once ISIS is defeated in both Mosul and (Raqqa), there will still be a lot of hard fighting ahead,  he said. From Monday afternoon to Tuesday afternoon, coalition warplanes and artillery hit IS boats, tactical units, fighting positions, vehicles and a weapons store, spokesman Col. Ryan Dillon said.  The coalition struck 19 boats that jihadists were using to ferry fighters and equipment across the Euphrates - their only means of accessing the city from land they control on the south bank, he said.  Security officials in the West have warned of increased threat of attacks such as last month's Manchester suicide bombing and Saturday's attack in London as Islamic State loses ground in Syria and Iraq. Both attacks were claimed by Islamic State.       An Arab group fighting with the SDF, the Syrian Elite Forces, which was established in February, had entered al-Mishlab with coalition air support, its spokesman Mohammed al-Shaker said by phone.   The Syrian Elite Forces one or two hours ago entered the first quarter of Raqqa, which is al-Mishlab quarter, via the eastern front,  he said.  The Observatory said the SDF had captured some buildings in the al-Mishlab area and Islamic State fighters had withdrawn from parts of the district. The Observatory also said an attack was underway against a military barracks, Division 17, on the northern outskirts of Raqqa. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) spokesman Talal Silo speaks during a news conference in Hukoumiya village in Raqqa, Syria June 6, 2017.Rodi SaidThe U.S.-led coalition has said 3,000-4,000 Islamic State fighters are thought to be holed up in Raqqa city, where they have erected defences against the anticipated assault. The city is about 90 km (56 miles) from the border with Turkey. The SDF includes the powerful Kurdish YPG militia. Fighting around Raqqa since late last year has displaced tens of thousands of people, with many flooding camps in the area and others stranded in the desert. Civilian Deaths The U.N. human rights office has raised concerns about increasing reports of civilian deaths as air strikes escalate. The Raqqa campaign has  resulted in massive civilian casualties, displacement and serious infrastructure destruction  so far, it said in a May report. Islamic State militants have also reportedly been preventing civilians from leaving, it said. The U.S.-led coalition says it tries to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and Iraq and investigates any allegations.  It is unclear how many civilians remain in Raqqa.  U.N. humanitarian spokesman Jens Laerke told Reuters that, for its planning purposes, the United Nations estimates there are approximately 160,000 people left in Raqqa city, but said this was not a formal estimate.  Humanitarian aid organization International Rescue Committee said 200,000 people were still trapped inside, and warned civilians in Raqqa risk being killed by Islamic State snipers or mines if they try to flee but could be used by the militants as human shields if they remain.  The IRC has seen a drop in the number of people escaping Raqqa over the past week,  its Middle East Director of Public Affairs Thomas Garofalo said, adding this may indicate Islamic State intended to use them as human shields.   Dillon said the SDF had encouraged civilians to quit Raqqa to avoid this fate and had set up screening centers on front lines to separate civilian refugees from fleeing fighters.  He said the coalition expected IS to use similar tactics to those it had employed during the months-long battle in Mosul, including the use of armored car bombs as its  weapon of choice .  They have had three years to establish their defences there. We expect a fight very similar to what we've seen in Mosul,  he said, while adding that Raqqa is a much smaller city.  The Raqqa campaign has been the source of tension between the United States and Turkey, which fears growing Kurdish influence in northern Syria and has lobbied Washington to abandon its Kurdish YPG allies. The YPG has been the main partner for the United States in its campaign against Islamic State in Syria, where the group is also being fought in separate campaigns waged by the Russian-backed Syrian government and Free Syrian Army rebel groups.   The United States last week said it had started distributing arms to the YPG to help take Raqqa. The SDF has said it will hand control of Raqqa to a civilian council after its capture, as in other areas the SDF took from Islamic State. The SDF and YPG control a swathe of northeastern Syria from the Iraqi border to the city of Manbij on the western banks of the Euphrates. The main Kurdish groups and their allies have established autonomous administration in the areas under their control, which they aim to preserve in any peace deal.

The survey comes amid accusations of Russian hacking activity in other countries, including during the presidential elections in the United States and France. Russia denies the accusations. Lithuania, once ruled by Moscow but now in NATO and the European Union, is on the political frontline of tensions between the West and Russia. Vilnius has regularly accused Moscow of trying to destabilize its institutions through cyber warfare.  In contrast to the civilized world, where cyber threats are mostly criminal in nature and with a commercial intent, the cyber threats we are facing have a geopolitical aspect to them,  Lithuanian Central Bank Governor Vitas Vasiliauskas, said, when asked to comment on dangers posed by Russian state-sponsored hacking to the country's banking system.  In our region these threats are serious.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that patriotic Russian hackers may have staged cyber attacks against countries that had strained relations with Moscow on their own initiative, but he denied that the Russian state had ever been involved in such hacking. Earlier this year Lithuania said it had found Russian spyware on three of its government computers and had detected dozens of attempted break-ins. A spokesman for Putin called the claims  nonsense . Lithuania's counter-intelligence chief Darius Jauniskis told Reuters that Russia had attempted to sow chaos in Lithuania by orchestrating a cyber attack in 2012 against the Lithuanian central bank and its top online news website, which brought both down. Suspected Russia-backed hackers have also launched exploratory cyber attacks against the energy networks of the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, sources have told Reuters, raising security concerns in NATO. Apart from cyber crime, the financial institutions polled by the central bank also rated a sharp increase in risk premiums in global financial markets and the threat of imbalances in the local real estate market as posing a threat to Lithuania's financial stability.

Dr. Jean-Yves Reginster of Liege State University in Belgium and colleagues recruited 604 people over age 50 with knee osteoarthritis from five European countries and randomly assigned them to take 800 mg of the extra-pure chondroitin sulfate (Chondrosulf), 200 mg of celecoxib (Celebrex) or a placebo every day for six months.  Those who took chondroitin sulfate or celecoxib had similar levels of pain relief at the end of the study, and in both groups the improvement was greater than for those taking just a placebo, according to the report in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.  Reginster told Reuters Health the findings are in line with earlier studies showing pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate could significantly decrease the progression of knee osteoarthritis over a period of three years. He stressed that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin is not the same as over-the-counter supplements, which are made differently and can’t get into the joint in high enough concentrations to combat the causes of cartilage degradation and pain. European regulatory bodies recommend pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate as well as pharmaceutical-grade glucosamine sulfate as first-line treatments for osteoarthritis, Reginster said by email, because of the side effects associated with celecoxib and other non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including stomach ulcers, bleeding, liver and kidney problems. Dr. Michael Shepard of Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Orange, California, noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most U.S. studies of this type would run two years rather than six months.  In addition, U.S.-based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results, said Shepard, who wasn’t involved in the study. Some have found the supplements to be as effective as ibuprofen (also an NSAID), and some have found that chondroitin sulfate is no more effective than placebo, he told Reuters Health.  “I tell my patients, ‘buyer beware,’” Shepard said in an email. “I tell them about the mixed results of chondroitin in the literature. I tell them to try chondroitin for one month as a trial and if they like it and feel better with it, then keep taking it.”  If chondroitin doesn’t work for them, he suggests taking an NSAID “periodically,” and to be aware of the side effects.  “If you are going to stay on an NSAID for a prolonged period then you need regular follow up with your doctor,” Shepard cautioned.  Dr. Rachel Wolfe of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, agreed that chondroitin is “reasonable to try” for some people, especially those with contraindications to NSAIDs.  “However, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit. It should be used in conjunction with these measures,” said Wolfe, who wasn’t involved in the study.  “Chondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,” Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. “Studies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.” The study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.

The Justice Department on Monday charged Reality Leigh Winner, 25, with removing classified material from a government facility in Georgia. It said she was arrested on Saturday. It was one of the first concrete efforts by the administration of President Donald Trump to crack down on leaks to the media. The charges were announced less than an hour after The Intercept published a top-secret document from the NSA that described Russian efforts to launch cyber attacks on at least one U.S. voting software supplier and send  spear-phishing  emails, or targeted emails, that try to trick a recipient into clicking on a malicious link to steal data, to more than 100 local election officials days before the Nov. 8 U.S. election. While the charges do not name the publication, a U.S. official with knowledge of the case said Winner was charged with leaking the NSA report to The Intercept. A second official confirmed The Intercept document was authentic and did not dispute that the charges were directly tied to it. The Justice Department declined to comment on the case beyond its filing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Winner's mother also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Intercept report carried details it said supported the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian intelligence services were seeking to infiltrate state voter registration systems as part of a broader effort to interfere in the election, discredit Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and help the Republican Trump win the election. The new material does not suggest that actual votes were manipulated. Reality Leigh Winner, 25, a federal contractor charged by the U.S. Department of Justice for sending classified material to a news organization, poses in a picture posted to her Instagram account.   Reality Winner/Social Media via REUTERSThe Intercept co-founding editor Glenn Greenwald did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While partially redacted, the NSA document is marked to show it would be up for declassification on May 5, 2042. The indictment against Winner alleges she  printed and improperly removed  classified intelligence reporting that was dated  on or about May 5, 2017.  Classified documents are typically due to be declassified after 25 years under an executive order signed under former President Bill Clinton. Slideshow (6 Images)The NSA opened a facility in Augusta in 2012 at Fort Gordon, a U.S. Army outpost. The FBI and several congressional committees are investigating how Russia interfered in the election and whether associates of President Donald Trump may have colluded with Russian intelligence operatives during the campaign. Trump has dismissed the allegations as  fake news  and sought to focus attention on leaks of information to the media. Winner graduated from basic military training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio in 2011. Investigators determined she was one of only six individuals to print the document in question and that she had exchanged emails with the news outlet, according to the criminal complaint. The complaint said that on Saturday, Winner told an FBI agent she had intentionally printed classified intelligence and mailed it to a news organization while knowing  the contents of the reporting could be used to the injury of the United States and to the advantage of a foreign nation.  U.S. intelligence agencies including the NSA and Central Intelligence Agency have fallen victim to several thefts of classified material in recent years, often at the hands of a federal contractor. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 disclosed secret documents to journalists, including Greenwald, that revealed broad U.S. surveillance programs.

Gulf states have rejected Qatar's explanation, leaving local media to unleash a barrage of attacks on the emir, accusing him of cosying up to Iran. The row erupted days after the first visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia, in which he sought to galvanize the fight against Islamist militancy and Iran, which Washington sees as a threat to regional stability. An Arab official, who asked not to be identified, said that experts from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had been helping with the probe since last week.  The results of the investigation will be made public this week,  the official told Reuters, adding that two countries were also assisting with the probe, but declining to give further details.

The officials gave no details of the number of people on the U.S. team or progress in the investigation. The rift has revived a 2014 row that erupted over alleged Qatari support for the Muslim Brotherhood and meddling in the affairs of other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, both members of the GCC, have labeled the Brotherhood a terrorist organization. Qatar's emir has visited Kuwait in what appeared to be an attempt by the Kuwaitis to mediate between Doha on one side and Abu Dhabi and Riyadh on the other. There was no immediate sign of a breakthrough. Saudi and UAE media on Saturday continued their criticism of Qatar. One newspaper posted a story citing what it said were Qatari ties with Israel, using an old picture of the then Qatari emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani shaking hands with the late Israeli President Shimon Peres.  Most Gulf Arab states have no official ties with Israel. Qatar briefly hosted an Israeli trade office but it was shut several years ago.

Energy, whether oil and natural gas, or wind and solar power and advanced batteries, is an important part of the economic power Washington has that can influence developing economies, said the report by CNA Military Advisory Board, called Advanced Energy and U.S. National Security. (bit.ly/2r1StT2)  Along with diplomatic and military power, economic power, including energy technology and trade, underpins national security, said the report, funded by the Tellus Mater Foundation and the Energy Foundation, groups that support the transition to cleaner forms of energy.  We Americans need to get our butts in gear,  Lee Gunn, a retired Navy vice admiral, who helped write the report, said in an interview.  Washington has developed relations in the Middle East since the early 1930s when oil exploration began in Saudi Arabia, and a large part of its military presence in the region has protected the flows of petroleum to the West. But as the world's energy needs grow and spread to new regions and as consumers become open to new technologies, the United States must also adapt, said the report, which the authors discussed with security and defense officials in the Trump administration. Russia and Iran, two countries not always friendly to Washington, are positioning themselves to meet burgeoning oil and natural gas demand in India and China. For example, a nearly $13 billion agreement giving Russian state oil firm Rosneft and its partners a 98 percent share of India's Essar oil company is expected to close this month. [nL8N1IZ4ZB] Meanwhile, China and countries in Europe are leading the way in investing in clean energy in Africa and India, where energy demand is expected to grow strongly for decades.    The transition to advanced energy is underway and will proceed with or without the active participation of the U.S. government, or technology, or in terms of manufacturing,  Gunn said. The report did not mention the Paris Agreement on climate which President Donald Trump last week pulled the United States out of. It recommended that the evolving global energy landscape should be fully integrated into U.S. national security and national defense strategies. It also said the federal government should share investments with the private sector in advanced energy projects.

The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, published on Tuesday also suggests that a recent moderation in job growth could be the result of a skills mismatch rather than easing demand for labor.  These data underscore the difficulty in hiring new workers, which we think is increasingly likely to be a factor restraining payroll growth going forward,  said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.  The Fed becomes somewhat uneasy when the labor market becomes too tight and this report supports the Fed's case to nudge rates higher next week.  JOLTS is one of the metrics on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard of labor market indicators. It came ahead of the U.S. central bank's June 13-14 policy meeting, at which it is expected to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 259,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.0 million in April, the highest since the government started tracking the series in 2000.  The monthly increase was the largest in just over a year and pushed the jobs openings rate to 4.0 percent, the highest since last July, from 3.8 percent in March.  Hiring, however, decreased by 253,000 jobs to 5.1 million. That lowered the hiring rate to a one-year low of 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent in March. A man speaks with a job recruiter at the Nassau County Mega Job Fair at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York October 7, 2014.Shannon StapletonThe gap between job openings and hiring points to a growing skills mismatch. A report from the National Federation of Independent Business last week showed the share of small business owners reporting job openings they could not fill in May was the highest since November 2000. Full Employment The economy created 138,000 in May, well below the average monthly job gains of 181,000 over the prior 12 months. Economists believe tightening labor market conditions could soon unleash a faster pace of wage growth. Wage gains have remained sluggish even as the unemployment rate has tumbled to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. The JOLTS report also showed 1.6 million people were laid off in April, little changed from March. The layoffs and discharges rate was unchanged at 1.1 percent for five straight months. The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs fell by 111,000 to 3.0 million in April.  As a result, the quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence, dipped to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent in March.  The economy has already reached the nirvana of full employment. At full employment the focus shifts from worries about the demand for labor to concerns about the supply of labor,  said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.  There aren't enough workers to man the factories and stock the store shelves. The supply demand imbalance is only likely to grow worse as the baby boom generation retires.

The center-right leader's opponents see a court ruling as a way out of the political crisis set off by corruption allegations leveled against him, but a decision could take weeks if not months and can be appealed by Temer. The court's decision is key to deciding the political future of Brazil, where the prospect of having a second president ousted in one year has generated political volatility. The uncertainty has weakened the real currency against the dollar and depressed stocks on the Sao Paulo bourse in recent days. Temer was the running mate of leftist President Dilma Rousseff and replaced her when she was impeached last year. If he is removed from office, lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia would take over from Temer and Congress would have 30 days to pick a caretaker to lead the country until elections in late 2018. Left-wing parties are calling for early general elections for Brazilians to pick a new president directly. If Temer is found guilty, he is expected to appeal which could delay the process for months. The government would likely destabilize and prompt members of his coalition to withdraw their support, increasing chances he could be forced to resign. The main ally in his governing coalition, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), is waiting for the court ruling to decide whether to abandon Temer's government, which would sink his fiscal reform agenda. The electoral court had been expected to blame Rousseff and absolve Temer, but that is now unlikely due to recent plea-bargain testimony by executives of giant meatpacker JBS SA who alleged they gave illegal funds to his campaign. Temer has refused to resign since the Supreme Court late last month authorized an investigation against him for alleged corruption, racketeering and obstruction of justice. The investigation is based in part on a secret recording of a conversation with a JBS executive in which Temer appeared to agree to the payment of hush money to silence a key witness in a massive graft scandal.

Energy, whether oil and natural gas, or wind and solar power and advanced batteries, is an important part of the economic power Washington has that can influence developing economies, said the report by CNA Military Advisory Board, called Advanced Energy and U.S. National Security. (bit.ly/2r1StT2)  Along with diplomatic and military power, economic power, including energy technology and trade, underpins national security, said the report, funded by the Tellus Mater Foundation and the Energy Foundation, groups that support the transition to cleaner forms of energy.  We Americans need to get our butts in gear,  Lee Gunn, a retired Navy vice admiral, who helped write the report, said in an interview.  Washington has developed relations in the Middle East since the early 1930s when oil exploration began in Saudi Arabia, and a large part of its military presence in the region has protected the flows of petroleum to the West. But as the world's energy needs grow and spread to new regions and as consumers become open to new technologies, the United States must also adapt, said the report, which the authors discussed with security and defense officials in the Trump administration. Russia and Iran, two countries not always friendly to Washington, are positioning themselves to meet burgeoning oil and natural gas demand in India and China. For example, a nearly $13 billion agreement giving Russian state oil firm Rosneft and its partners a 98 percent share of India's Essar oil company is expected to close this month. [nL8N1IZ4ZB] Meanwhile, China and countries in Europe are leading the way in investing in clean energy in Africa and India, where energy demand is expected to grow strongly for decades.    The transition to advanced energy is underway and will proceed with or without the active participation of the U.S. government, or technology, or in terms of manufacturing,  Gunn said. The report did not mention the Paris Agreement on climate which President Donald Trump last week pulled the United States out of. It recommended that the evolving global energy landscape should be fully integrated into U.S. national security and national defense strategies. It also said the federal government should share investments with the private sector in advanced energy projects.

Polling firm Opinium said the lead of May's Conservative Party over Labor had widened to seven points, up by a percentage point from its previous poll published on Saturday. The new poll was the first by a major firm that was conducted in its entirety after a deadly attack in London by Islamist militants on June 3. The field work ran from June 4-6.  It put support for the Conservatives at 43 percent, unchanged from Saturday's poll, while Labor fell one point to 36 percent.   Labour's campaign surge appears to have crested as our final poll of the campaign is the first to see the Tory (Conservative) lead expand rather than contract,  said Opinium's head of political polling, Adam Drummond.  If this is the start of a trend, and it is supported by other work Opinium has done, then it is worth bearing in mind that at the last election 15 percent of voters made their mind up either on polling day or the day before.   British opinion polls have shown a wide range of estimates of support for the two main political parties, adding to scepticism among many critics who hammered the industry for failing to accurately predict the outcome of the 2015 election and last year's referendum vote to exit the European Union. However, all the polls have shown a steady narrowing of the lead of May's Conservatives over the past three weeks following the publication of the parties' election policy pledges. Opinium had a Conservative lead of 19 points over Labor early in the campaign. May began to struggle after she fielded a plan to make elderly people pay for more of their social care, even though she moved quickly to say there would be a limit on the amount of costs that people would face.    In the wake of Saturday's attack on London by Islamist militants who killed seven people and injured 48, Opinium said its poll showed a significant rise in national security as an issue for voters - 11 percent said anti-terrorism policy would influence their vote, up from 2 percent last week.  Respondents said May was the most trusted leader on fighting terrorism and on Brexit, while Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn was most trusted on Britain's health service. The Opinium poll made for more comfortable reading for May than another one published overnight by Survation which showed her lead over Labor had narrowed to just 1 percentage point. The Conservatives had a slim 17-seat majority before parliament was dissolved for the snap election. The poll, for ITV television, was conducted on Friday and Saturday, before the attack in London. It echoed another Survation poll, published for the Mail on Sunday newspaper, which also gave the Conservatives a one-point lead. No other poll has shown a lead that tight.

Hoguet's comments, made during an investor meeting, sent Macy's shares dropping as much as 7.5 percent to five-year lows, and triggered a slump in shares of other U.S. department store chains. Competition from Amazon.com Inc and other online retailers is growing, forcing brick-and-mortar chains to close stores and cut costs. Macy's full-year gross margin could be 60 to 80 basis points lower than in 2016, Hoguet said, and second-quarter gross margin would be down 100 basis points from the year-ago period. The margin was 39.4 percent in the fiscal year ended Jan. 28, and 40.9 percent in the fiscal 2016 second quarter. Macy's is  doing everything it can to be productive,  Hoguet said, adding that she hoped cost reduction efforts would improve margins.

Adjusted EBITDA margin at the facilities management business, the company's largest, fell 2.6 percentage points in the first quarter ended April 30 from a year earlier, marking its fourth straight decline. The unit distributes everything from plumbing products to electrical parts used in facilities management. In contrast, margins at the waterworks business, which includes water and sewer products, slipped about 0.2 percentage points. The dip in margins at the facilities unit could suggest HD Supply is facing increasing competition from big-box retailers, analysts said.  We have previously flagged the Waterworks transaction as a positive catalyst since it re-focused the portfolio on two end markets, is margin accretive, reduces leverage to sector norms and introduces a capital return deployment strategy,  Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe said in a note.  However, it is unfortunate that this announcement coincides with such a weak performance from the FM business.  Shares of the Atlanta-based company slumped as much as 19 percent to $33.41 on Tuesday. HD Supply, which was carved out of retailer Home Depot Inc (HD.N) in 2007, said it would sell the waterworks business to private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice to reduce debt and streamline its operations. The company has long-term debt of $3.86 billion as of Jan 29. HD Supply has been looking to position its construction and facilities maintenance businesses to benefit from U.S. President Donald Trump's emphasis on infrastructure spending and tax reform. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. Goldman Sachs was HD Supply's financial adviser and King & Spalding its legal counsel on the transaction.

He made two relief appearances prior to that, throwing two scoreless innings. RHP Ian Kennedy permitted four runs on six hits and three walks over five innings.  After two innings, he had more balls than strikes,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  That's not recommended, especially against this team, to pitch behind in the count because they can do a lot of damage.  3B Mike Moustakas, who had batted second in 44 games, was shifted to the sixth slot.

The 34-year-old began the season on the disabled list due to left shoulder discomfort. LHP J.P. Howell (left shoulder tightness) was placed on the 10-day disabled list Monday. Howell is 1-1 with an 8.31 ERA in 13 relief appearances over 8 2/3 innings. LHP Jeff Beliveau was recalled from Triple-A Buffalo to take Howell's place on the 25-man roster. LHP J.A.

RHP Duncan Robinson of Class A South Bend, was named the Cubs' minor league pitcher for May on Monday. Robinson, 23, went 2-1 with a 1.00 ERA in five games, including three starts. He tossed a season-high 7.0 innings twice and his 0.70 WHIP led the Midwest League. RHP Jake Arrieta (5-4, 4.60 ERA) makes his 12th start of the season but only fourth at home on Tuesday. In his last start on May 31 at San Diego he had no decision despite his fifth quality effort while allowing just one earned run over six innings on five hits while striking out seven. Arrieta has made two career starts against Miami, both over an 11-day span from June 8-18, 2014 and collected 18 strikeouts while allowing just one earned run on eight hits.

LHP Mike Montgomery recorded his second career regular-season save, both coming in his last three outings. He worked 3 1/3 innings while allowing no runs on three hits and striking out three. Both saves have been at least three innings, including a four-inning save on May 25 against San Francisco. C Willson Contreras went 2-for-3 and is batting .353 in his last 15 starts.

He's now gone 5-for-10 with three homers and eight RBIs against Marlins starter Dan Straily. RHP Eddie Butler (3-1) continued to make a case that he belongs on the Chicago Cubs roster on Monday. Called up last month after LHP Brett Anderson went on the disabled list, the Cubs right-hander allowed just one run in a 5 2/3 inning outing as Chicago beat the Miami Marlins 3-1.  Today we really attacked the zone, limited the walks and were ahead in the count a lot,  said Butler, who gave up three hits, walked one and struck out four. C Victor Caratini of the Cubs' Triple-A Iowa affiliate was named the organization's minor league player of the month for May on Monday. Caratini, a 23-year-old switch hitter, batted .366 with six doubles, a triple, three homers and 17 RBIs in 24 games. RHP Wade Davis was placed on the paternity list on Monday and could be out as many as three days this week.

Fending off the challenge from Greenlight founder David Einhorn does not mean the end of Barra's battles. GM shares traded on Tuesday at $34.25, about 16 percent lower than when Barra became CEO, despite robust profits and a series of moves to sell or shut down money losing operations. The win also does not mean pressure will let up from Greenlight, which is the fifth largest shareholder, and while gracious in defeat, continued to make the case for fresh faces on the board.  We are disappointed that shareholders have elected to maintain the status quo,  Einhorn said in a statement on Tuesday.  We congratulate GM’s management on their win today.  Greenlight's campaign came as U.S. auto industry sales of new vehicles have begun to wane after a boom cycle that has lasted since 2010. Silicon Valley electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc this year surpassed GM's market value, reflecting investor confidence that, despite heavy losses, Tesla has a better strategy as the auto industry shifts to ride services and electric, autonomous vehicles. In comments before Tuesday's shareholder meeting, Barra acknowledged Greenlight's position on its stock price, saying  we do believe GM stock is undervalued,  and said the company  is continually looking at ideas  to increase investor interest. Preliminary results showed more than 91 percent of shareholders voted against Greenlight's proposal to have GM offer dividend and capital appreciation shares, according to GM officials at the meeting. GM's board nominees were elected with between 84 percent and 99 percent of the vote, the company said. The board will remain the same at 11 members, with Barra as chairman. Einhorn floated the dual-class proposal in March, saying it could boost the automaker's $52-billion market capitalization by as much as $38 billion. Greenlight, which owns a 3.6 percent stake in GM, later nominated three directors for the company's board: Leo Hindery, who served as CEO for five telecommunications and media companies, including AT&T; Broadband and Liberty Media; Vinit Sethi, Greenlight's director of research and William Thorndike, founder Housatonic Partners and the chairman of Consol Energy. Greenlight hoped to replace three incumbent directors: Jane Mendillo, Michael Mullen and Carol Stephenson. But Einhorn's pitch flopped with debt rating agencies and proxy advisers and he failed to rally other shareholders to his cause. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which holds a 3.3 percent stake in GM, remained silent on the proposal. Einhorn added in Tuesday's statement that GM should still consider Hindery and Thorndike for the board. Greenlight is a multi-strategy hedge fund that has taken on other corporate giants such as Apple Inc, but whose last activist proxy contest was more than 10 years ago. Jason Schloetzer, professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business, said Greenlight's loss is not a major blow to the roughly $10 billion hedge fund and time will tell if its stake earns the kind of returns Einhorn hopes to reap.  While Greenlight would have liked to have increased their influence over GM’s financial management, it's unfair to conclude from today's vote that the fund will not be successful in its investment over the medium term,  Schloetzer said.

The survey comes amid accusations of Russian hacking activity in other countries, including during the presidential elections in the United States and France. Russia denies the accusations. Lithuania, once ruled by Moscow but now in NATO and the European Union, is on the political frontline of tensions between the West and Russia. Vilnius has regularly accused Moscow of trying to destabilize its institutions through cyber warfare.  In contrast to the civilized world, where cyber threats are mostly criminal in nature and with a commercial intent, the cyber threats we are facing have a geopolitical aspect to them,  Lithuanian Central Bank Governor Vitas Vasiliauskas, said, when asked to comment on dangers posed by Russian state-sponsored hacking to the country's banking system.  In our region these threats are serious.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that patriotic Russian hackers may have staged cyber attacks against countries that had strained relations with Moscow on their own initiative, but he denied that the Russian state had ever been involved in such hacking. Earlier this year Lithuania said it had found Russian spyware on three of its government computers and had detected dozens of attempted break-ins. A spokesman for Putin called the claims  nonsense . Lithuania's counter-intelligence chief Darius Jauniskis told Reuters that Russia had attempted to sow chaos in Lithuania by orchestrating a cyber attack in 2012 against the Lithuanian central bank and its top online news website, which brought both down. Suspected Russia-backed hackers have also launched exploratory cyber attacks against the energy networks of the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, sources have told Reuters, raising security concerns in NATO. Apart from cyber crime, the financial institutions polled by the central bank also rated a sharp increase in risk premiums in global financial markets and the threat of imbalances in the local real estate market as posing a threat to Lithuania's financial stability.

His testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's legislative agenda of rolling back healthcare reforms and overhauling the tax code. Investors will also watch out for the European Central Bank's meet, where policymakers are expected to take a more benign view of the economy, according to sources.  We have a relatively light week in terms of economic data and investors are awaiting Thursday's events,  said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.  The market's reaction to Comey's testimony would depend on if he says something new that nobody knows about, although, a lot of what he might be asked could be classified information.  Safe havens were in favor, with gold touching its highest in about seven weeks and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields falling to their lowest levels since the days following the November election. At 12:35 p.m. ET (1635 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 20.17 points, or 0.1 percent, at 21,163.87 and the S&P; 500 was down 3.28 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,432.82. The Nasdaq Composite was down 3.97 points, or 0.06 percent, at 6,291.72. Six of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with the consumer discretionary and financial indexes leading the decliners. Walt Disney's 1 percent fall weighed the most on the consumer discretionary sector. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores fell 1.8 percent to $78.85, dragging down the Dow and the S&P.; Amazon.com said it would offer Prime subscription service at a discount to its U.S. customers on government aid, taking aim at a key customer base of the discount retailer. Amazon was up 0.2 percent. HD Supply Holdings plunged 19 percent to a near seven-month low of $33.41 after the industrial distributor said it would sell a unit to private equity firm for $2.5 billion. The stock was the second-biggest drag on the Nasdaq. Michaels Cos fell as much as 9 percent to a three-year low of $18.05 after the crafts and home decor retailer slashed its forecast. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,633 to 1,182. On the Nasdaq, 1,788 issues fell and 989 advanced. The S&P; 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

Babich,Richard Simon,Sunrise Lee,INSYS,COURT/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - Prosecutors probing sales of a fentanyl-based drug made by Insys Therapeutics Inc say a former company manager accused of conspiring to defraud insurers into paying for the painkiller has agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with authorities. Elizabeth Gurrieri, a former manager of reimbursement services for Arizona-based Insys, will plead guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy, prosecutors said in a letter filed in Boston federal court on Monday. The filing is part of the criminal case against six ex-Insys executives and managers including former Chief Executive Michael Babich, who prosecutors say participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe the drug, Subsys. Gurrieri would become the second former Insys employee nationally to plead guilty in connection with Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray containing fentanyl, a highly addictive and regulated synthetic opioid. The Queen Creek, Arizona resident's agreement to cooperate came as Insys works to reach a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in connection with the investigation. Gurrieri's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. Insys declined to comment. It has said it is has been working to improve its compliance practices and is cooperating with authorities. Prosecutors alleged in December that Babich and others led a conspiracy to bribe medical practitioners to unnecessarily prescribe Subsys through payments disguised as marketing event and speaker fees. Other defendants include former Insys vice presidents Alec Burlakoff and Michael Gurry; former national sales director Richard Simon; and former regional sales directors Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan. All six have pleaded not guilty. The case against Gurrieri related to what prosecutors said was a push by Insys to get insurers to cover the expensive price of Subsys, which in 2013 cost about $2,340 for 60 units. According to a separate criminal complaint, Gurrieri and others at Insys directed fraudulent schemes to deceive insurers and pharmacy benefit managers in order to obtain payment authorization for Subsys. The complaint said Insys employees were taught to mislead insurers about the diagnosis of patients and whether they had tried and failed other preferred medications. Gurrieri also instructed employees to claim a cancer diagnosis regardless of the patient's history or whether Subsys was prescribed for a use not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the complaint said. The cases in U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, are U.S. v. Babich et al, No. 16-cr-10343, and U.S. v. Gurrieri, No. 17-cr-10083.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/insys-court-idUSL1N1J314P"},

The center-right leader's opponents see a court ruling as a way out of the political crisis set off by corruption allegations leveled against him, but a decision could take weeks if not months and can be appealed by Temer. The court's decision is key to deciding the political future of Brazil, where the prospect of having a second president ousted in one year has generated political volatility. The uncertainty has weakened the real currency against the dollar and depressed stocks on the Sao Paulo bourse in recent days. Temer was the running mate of leftist President Dilma Rousseff and replaced her when she was impeached last year. If he is removed from office, lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia would take over from Temer and Congress would have 30 days to pick a caretaker to lead the country until elections in late 2018. Left-wing parties are calling for early general elections for Brazilians to pick a new president directly. If Temer is found guilty, he is expected to appeal which could delay the process for months. The government would likely destabilize and prompt members of his coalition to withdraw their support, increasing chances he could be forced to resign. The main ally in his governing coalition, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), is waiting for the court ruling to decide whether to abandon Temer's government, which would sink his fiscal reform agenda. The electoral court had been expected to blame Rousseff and absolve Temer, but that is now unlikely due to recent plea-bargain testimony by executives of giant meatpacker JBS SA who alleged they gave illegal funds to his campaign. Temer has refused to resign since the Supreme Court late last month authorized an investigation against him for alleged corruption, racketeering and obstruction of justice. The investigation is based in part on a secret recording of a conversation with a JBS executive in which Temer appeared to agree to the payment of hush money to silence a key witness in a massive graft scandal. The political crisis engulfing Temer's government deepened on Saturday with the arrest of a close aide who was seen in a police video receiving a bag filled with 500,000 reais ($152,000) in cash.

The hospitals were in the capital Riyadh, in Bisha city, and in Wadi al-Dawasir in Riyadh province, the same town that reported a MERS hospital outbreak in April, although the WHO did not say if the new outbreak was related to that.   MERS is thought to be carried by camels and comes from the same family as the coronavirus that caused China's deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. The WHO said two men in the United Arab Emirates and one man in Qatar also caught the disease last month after contact with camels, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1,980 since September 2012, with at least 699 deaths.  Most of the known human-to-human transmission has occurred in healthcare settings, and the WHO has previously said hospitals and medical workers should take stringent precautions as standard to stop the disease spreading. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, who steps down on June 30, has criticized Saudi Arabia for allowing MERS to spread in its hospitals, and the WHO has suggested developing a vaccine for camels may be part of the solution.  Last year the failure to spot MERS in a patient in a vascular surgery ward in Saudi Arabia led to more than 49 other people being exposed to the disease. Although most cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia, a man who had traveled in the Gulf triggered a major outbreak in South Korea in mid-2015, causing 186 cases within two months.

Adjusted EBITDA margin at the facilities management business, the company's largest, fell 2.6 percentage points in the first quarter ended April 30 from a year earlier, marking its fourth straight decline. The unit distributes everything from plumbing products to electrical parts used in facilities management. In contrast, margins at the waterworks business, which includes water and sewer products, slipped about 0.2 percentage points. The dip in margins at the facilities unit could suggest HD Supply is facing increasing competition from big-box retailers, analysts said.  We have previously flagged the Waterworks transaction as a positive catalyst since it re-focused the portfolio on two end markets, is margin accretive, reduces leverage to sector norms and introduces a capital return deployment strategy,  Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe said in a note.  However, it is unfortunate that this announcement coincides with such a weak performance from the FM business.  Shares of the Atlanta-based company slumped as much as 19 percent to $33.41 on Tuesday. HD Supply, which was carved out of retailer Home Depot Inc (HD.N) in 2007, said it would sell the waterworks business to private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice to reduce debt and streamline its operations. The company has long-term debt of $3.86 billion as of Jan 29. HD Supply has been looking to position its construction and facilities maintenance businesses to benefit from U.S. President Donald Trump's emphasis on infrastructure spending and tax reform. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. Goldman Sachs was HD Supply's financial adviser and King & Spalding its legal counsel on the transaction.

The Renault team posted a teasing picture on Twitter of the 32-year-old removing his helmet after driving the 2012 Lotus E20 car at Valencia's Ricardo Tormo circuit.  So guys...we need to come clean about something,  the caption said.  It's true. It really is Robert Kubica,  the team added in a later post.  Back in one of our cars after six years.  The test took place amid considerable secrecy, with no advance notice given to the media and little information provided about the reasons for the private test.  So why did we keep it quiet? It was a private test, for Robert,  the team said, adding that the Pole had completed 115 laps with  the biggest smile  afterwards. Kubica, who in 2008 became the first Pole to win a Formula One race when he triumphed with BMW-Sauber in Canada, last drove a Formula One car with Renault in pre-season testing at the same circuit in February 2011. Renault have left and returned to the sport with their own team since then, with a current line-up of Germany's Nico Hulkenberg and Britain's Jolyon Palmer. The latter has yet to score a point in six races this season with increasing media speculation about his future ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix. Kubica's F1 career ended in the same month as his last test when he suffered severe arm, leg and hand injuries in a near-fatal crash during a minor rally in northern Italy that he had entered for fun. He had been one of the sport's brightest prospects before his accident, with a likely move to Ferrari on the horizon. Since his recovery he has competed in the world rally championship and tested other cars, including those used in Formula E and GP3.

According to the meeting minutes released on Tuesday, the bank's growing uncertainty over President Michel Temer's reform agenda prompted policymakers to signal a slower pace of policy easing.     The bank's nine-member monetary policy committee, known as Copom, last week decided to lower its benchmark Selic rate  by 100 basis points to 10.25 percent.      Yields on interest rate futures reflect traders expectations for a smaller 75-basis-point cut in the bank's July meeting, with a smaller chance of a 50-basis-point reduction.     The prospect of a slower pace of cuts helped foster demand for the Brazilian real, but the currency's gains were limited by concerns over the implementation of structural reforms - seen as critical to curbing debt growth - amid a widening political scandal.     An electoral court is set to begin later on Tuesday a trial over alleged illegal funding of former President Dilma Rousseff's 2014 campaign. The ruling could potentially oust Temer, who ran as Rousseff's vice president.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rose slightly, supported by rising shares of meatpacker JBS SA  after its operations in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay to rival Minerva SA for $300 million.      Mexico's peso extended gains for a second straight day following reports that was close to announcing it had reached a deal with the United States over the trade of sugar between both countries.     Concerns over U.S.-Mexico trade have weighed on the currency since the election of President Donald Trump, who has pledged to abandon the NAFTA trade pact.

The hospitals were in the capital Riyadh, in Bisha city, and in Wadi al-Dawasir in Riyadh province, the same town that reported a MERS hospital outbreak in April, although the WHO did not say if the new outbreak was related to that.   MERS is thought to be carried by camels and comes from the same family as the coronavirus that caused China's deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. The WHO said two men in the United Arab Emirates and one man in Qatar also caught the disease last month after contact with camels, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1,980 since September 2012, with at least 699 deaths.  Most of the known human-to-human transmission has occurred in healthcare settings, and the WHO has previously said hospitals and medical workers should take stringent precautions as standard to stop the disease spreading. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, who steps down on June 30, has criticized Saudi Arabia for allowing MERS to spread in its hospitals, and the WHO has suggested developing a vaccine for camels may be part of the solution.  Last year the failure to spot MERS in a patient in a vascular surgery ward in Saudi Arabia led to more than 49 other people being exposed to the disease. Although most cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia, a man who had traveled in the Gulf triggered a major outbreak in South Korea in mid-2015, causing 186 cases within two months.

The first generation of the 116-seat E195 was outsold more than three-to-one by the 100-seat E190, but a larger, re-engined version entering service in early 2019 as part of the so-called E2 lineup has attracted another level of interest.  It's fair to say that the E195 features heavily in almost every conversation about the E2 family,  John Slattery, head of Embraer's commercial aviation business, said in an interview late on Monday at the International Air Transport Association's annual meeting.  There's a distinct possibility for the E2 that the E195 outsells the E190.  The possible reversal highlights how three additional rows of seats and longer, sweeping wings have forced many airlines to take a second look at Embraer's biggest airliner, now aimed squarely at rival Bombardier Inc's (BBDb.TO) new CSeries. For Embraer, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker after Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N), the E195 is the biggest change in its E2 lineup, which has focused on its core regional aviation market as Bombardier picks bigger fights. While Bombardier sells larger CSeries aircraft against the lower end of the narrowbody families built by Boeing and Airbus, Embraer has said it has no plans for passenger jets larger than the new E195. Bombardier's CSeries offers unparalleled range for an aircraft of its size, but even that advantage has shrunk as a new engine boosts the range of the E195 by some 600 miles (966 km) from the first generation. Last week Embraer extended the range of the E195-E2 to 2,600 miles from a previous estimate of 2,450 miles on better-than-expected aerodynamics of a prototype that started flying in March. Bombardier's CS100 has a maximum range of 3,100 miles. The CSeries also boasts roomier cabins in a five-abreast layout, compared with Embraer's two-and-two seating. However, Slattery said the real selling point of the new E195 is an operating cost that rivals Airbus and Boeing narrowbodies on a per-seat basis while costing about 20 percent less per trip. Extra seats and skinny wings have made the new aircraft a  profit hunter,  he said. Editing by Matthew Lewis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-airlines-iata-embraer-idUSKBN18X271"},

Norway's Norsk Hydro said it was seeking other routes for its aluminium exports from Qatar, which have been blocked as a result of a diplomatic rift between the Gulf country and several Arab states. Norsk Hydro and state-owned Qatar Petroleum each own 50 percent of the Qatalum joint venture, which produces more than 600,000 tonnes of primary aluminium per year.  On a global scale Qatar plays a minor role in the aluminium market, direction is more dictated by China. There are sufficient (aluminium) supplies in China, inflows into Shanghai (warehouses) have increased and demand is relatively weak in summer,  said Casper Burgering, analyst at ABN Amro. * ALUMINIUM: London Metal Exchange aluminium ended flat at $1,903 a tonne, having earlier hit its lowest in three weeks at $1,887.  Physical (aluminium) premiums have already been falling for weeks in most regions. Given that the availability of aluminium is not likely to have increased substantially of late ... the fall in premiums can presumably be attributed to a somewhat weaker demand dynamism,  Commerzbank said in a note. * GLOBAL MARKETS: World stocks fell as tensions in the Middle East, an election in Britain and upcoming testimony from the former head of the FBI pushed investors away from risky assets. * COPPER: Copper ended down 0.2 percent at $5,616 a tonne, having hit a 2-1/2 week low of $5,553 on worries over Chinese and U.S. growth, and geopolitical risks. * DOLLAR: The dollar sank to its lowest in more than six weeks against the yen, but the fall failed to lift metals. A weaker dollar makes dollar-priced metals cheaper for non-U.S. investors. * OIL: Oil prices fell further below $50 a barrel on concerns that the Qatar diplomatic rift could undermine efforts by OPEC to tighten the market. Lower oil prices decrease mining costs and can deter investors from buying into commodity basket funds that include metals. * ZINC: Zinc, used to galvanise steel, closed down 1 percent at $2,461 a tonne, having hit a 2-1/2 week low of $2,458 earlier due to weak Chinese steel markets. * STEEL: Chinese steel futures fell for a ninth straight day, pressured by expectations of weak demand as a seasonal construction slowdown in the summer months looms. * OTHER METALS: Lead ended down 1.3 percent at $2,074, tin closed down 2.3 percent at $19,675, having earlier hit its lowest since late April, while nickel ended down 0.6 percent at $8,860.

Elizabeth Gurrieri, a former manager of reimbursement services for Arizona-based Insys, will plead guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy, prosecutors said in a letter filed in Boston federal court on Monday. The filing is part of the criminal case against six ex-Insys executives and managers including former Chief Executive Michael Babich, who prosecutors say participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe the drug, Subsys. Gurrieri would become the second former Insys employee nationally to plead guilty in connection with Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray containing fentanyl, a highly addictive and regulated synthetic opioid. The Queen Creek, Arizona resident's agreement to cooperate came as Insys works to reach a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in connection with the investigation. Gurrieri's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. Insys declined to comment. It has said it is has been working to improve its compliance practices and is cooperating with authorities.    Prosecutors alleged in December that Babich and others led a conspiracy to bribe medical practitioners to unnecessarily prescribe Subsys through payments disguised as marketing event and speaker fees. Other defendants include former Insys vice presidents Alec Burlakoff and Michael Gurry; former national sales director Richard Simon; and former regional sales directors Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan. All six have pleaded not guilty. The case against Gurrieri related to what prosecutors said was a push by Insys to get insurers to cover the expensive price of Subsys, which in 2013 cost about $2,340 for 60 units. According to a separate criminal complaint, Gurrieri and others at Insys directed fraudulent schemes to deceive insurers and pharmacy benefit managers in order to obtain payment authorization for Subsys.  The complaint said Insys employees were taught to mislead insurers about the diagnosis of patients and whether they had tried and failed other preferred medications. Gurrieri also instructed employees to claim a cancer diagnosis regardless of the patient's history or whether Subsys was prescribed for a use not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the complaint said. The cases in U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, are U.S. v. Babich et al, No. 16-cr-10343, and U.S. v. Gurrieri, No. 17-cr-10083.

The pound has seen choppy trading on polls suggesting outcomes ranging from a majority for Prime Minister Theresa May's party to a 'hung' parliament in which no party has an overall majority. A poll late on Monday from Survation for ITV television put the Conservatives' lead over the opposition Labour Party at just 1 percentage point.  That contrasted with an earlier ICM poll showing the Conservatives with an 11 point lead, which sent sterling higher on Monday.  We're seeing a little bit of ping-pong (in the pound) depending on where the polls are leaning, but I think it will calm down just as we approach the election,  said Thu Lan Nguyen, analyst at Commerzbank.  Most (investors) are still expecting a Tory (Conservative) win but not the scenario that they're going to expand their majority.  Investors had bet a predicted landslide win for May would strengthen her position in Britain's exit talks with the European Union, due to start later this month. But the latest polls were moderating some of those expectations, Nguyen said. The pound peaked on Tuesday at $1.2951 against a broadly weaker dollar, its highest in 12 days, before edging back to trade 0.1 percent lower on the day by 1606 GMT at $1.2895. While it has retained most of its gains against the dollar since May called the election seven weeks ago, sterling has fallen 2.5 percent in trade-weighted terms in less than four weeks since polls first suggested a narrowing lead for the Conservatives. U.S. positioning data shows speculative investors have flipped back to betting more against the pound; many hedge funds expect any recovery in sterling will be short-lived, regardless of the election result. One-week sterling-dollar implied volatility, which measures the cost of hedging against price swings in the currency pair, was at 12.5 percent, near its highest levels since Jan. 17, when May set out her Brexit strategy.

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha's fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).  Traders worried that Riyadh's allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.  Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.  U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding  radical ideology . Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.  Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.  The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf.  Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,  it said.  More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.  Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.  However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world's biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.  Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said:  We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.   Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.  Exclusion Zones  With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.  Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE's port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.  A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017.Thomas White/IllustrationLying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world's most important ports for the global energy market.  Qatar, the world's biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.  The UAE's ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.   This shouldn't affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It's a minor inconvenience,  one LNG trader said.  LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.  Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.  Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country's Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.  Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.  Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.   The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,  a trading source said.  The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway's Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.  Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.           Additional reporting by Jessica Jaganathan, Mark Tay, Yousri Ahmed, Jonathan Saul and Eman Kamel; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and David Stamp","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/gulf-qatar-commodities-idUSL3N1J33A3"},

The cash was to be used to finance the company's further shift away from relying on its television advertising business and create a more broadly based digital powerhouse, ProSieben Chief Executive Thomas Ebeling explained.  More than six months later, shareholders are still waiting for Ebeling to spend the money and are increasingly uneasy about the strategy. The broadcaster says its plan is simple -- to encourage viewers of its TV shows to use its online sites as well. Investors said an initial partnership with Zalando some five years ago raised expectations as the online fashion retailer grew into a European leader thanks in part to being  promoted on ProSieben's channels.  Our strategy is to realize synergies from the combination of our entertainment and commerce assets. The underlying idea is: watch, click and buy,  said a ProSieben spokeswoman. But critics say the company lacks a clear leader in an e-commerce portfolio which they argue is too diversified, with activities in travel, price comparison, online dating and even sex toys.  Shares in the group, which have been part of the DAX index of leading German companies for more than a year, have underperformed European media sector peers by 17 percent over the past 12 months.  There is a lot of scepticism at the moment,  said a top 10 ProSieben shareholder, noting that some investors opted to sell when the shares fell after the capital increase.    Everyone is now afraid of further value destruction,  he added.  It's not clear how they'll grow digital.  Defending the strategy, the company spokeswoman pointed to profits of 250 million euros ($282 million) generated by the 40 e-commerce firms ProSieben has bought at a cost of 1.1 billion euros since 2012. ProSieben has just passed the landmark of generating more than half of its revenues outside its traditional TV advertising business and aims to extend this trend in 2018. Potential Partners ProSieben, whose programs include  Germany's Next Top Model , faces familiar challenges to other established broadcasters in European markets.  Rival streaming services are disrupting viewing patterns and making it harder to deliver the mass audiences for which advertisers are prepared to pay premium rates. Faced with this changing landscape, ProSieben has held informal talks with a number of peers about possible tie-ups over the past 12-18 months, according to sources with knowledge of the talks. However, ProSieben's digital business, its strong German focus and still relatively high valuation, have put off all the potential partners. Only Britain's main commercial channel ITV - described by all the sources as the ideal partner in ProSieben's view despite the potential negative impact of Brexit in the short-term - could offer a glimmer of renewed hope after the departure of Chief Executive Adam Crozier at the end of this month. FILE PHOTO: Thomas Ebeling, CEO of Germany's biggest commercial broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG, poses before the company's annual news conference in Unterfoehring, north of Munich  February 28, 2013.Michael Dalder/File PhotoCrozier was seen as being opposed to a merger after successfully turning the British broadcaster around.A spokesman for ITV said the group does not comment on speculation.  ProSieben, however, thinks it is under no pressure for a transformational deal for at least the next five years, said sources familiar with its thinking. The company declined to comment directly on M&A; plans.  Meanwhile, Ebeling is hoping partnerships with European peers in video-on-demand (VOD) and production will help it fight off competition from the likes of Netflix.   ProSieben recently joined forces with Discovery, Italy's Mediaset and France's TF1 to create shows and content for Internet platforms such as YouTube. But some investors say the company risks falling between two stools as things stand.  They are not growing enough for a growth investor, not generating enough cash to be a proper cash return stock,  said Artemis fund manager Jacob de Tusch-Lec, a former top 25 investor before he sold his shares at the start of this year.  The patchy digital strategy and the dilution stemming from the cap hike make them the typical artificial growth stock.  Cash Pile ProSieben's own streaming platform Maxdome, its response to over-the-top media players such as Netflix and Amazon, is fading after a promising start. It has lost ground to those U.S. online competitors and now ranks only fourth in its home market behind sector leader Amazon, Netflix and Sky Deutschland, according to media consultant Goldmedia.       U.S.-based over-the-top players will eventually get better than European broadcasters at matching customers' expectations in every market in which they operate thanks to their data analytics capabilities,  said Wesley Lebeau, portfolio manager at CPR Asset Management.   This will cause a profound disruption and force free-to-air TV players in Europe to consolidate their market.  ProSieben is aiming to defend its position in the media market by supplying its own content to Netflix and Amazon. It is also on the lookout for regional acquisitions to strengthen its presence in German-speaking TV markets, although such small deals would hardly move the needle, the people said. ProSieben says its energy comparison site Verivox and most of its online travel agents are market leaders. Other online properties like dating site Parship are household names. However, a recent decision to explore a sale of some strong performing travel assets including eTRAVELI which it values at 500 million euros has added to concerns that the company is simply piling up cash with no clear plan how to spend it.  I held ProSieben from 2010 and it's been a great story for some time,  said de Tusch-Lec of Artemis.  It's not clear what the next chapter will be.

The pound has seen choppy trading on polls suggesting outcomes ranging from a majority for Prime Minister Theresa May's party to a 'hung' parliament in which no party has an overall majority. A poll late on Monday from Survation for ITV television put the Conservatives' lead over the opposition Labour Party at just 1 percentage point.  That contrasted with an earlier ICM poll showing the Conservatives with an 11 point lead, which sent sterling higher on Monday.  We're seeing a little bit of ping-pong (in the pound) depending on where the polls are leaning, but I think it will calm down just as we approach the election,  said Thu Lan Nguyen, analyst at Commerzbank.  Most (investors) are still expecting a Tory (Conservative) win but not the scenario that they're going to expand their majority.  Investors had bet a predicted landslide win for May would strengthen her position in Britain's exit talks with the European Union, due to start later this month. But the latest polls were moderating some of those expectations, Nguyen said. The pound peaked on Tuesday at $1.2951 against a broadly weaker dollar, its highest in 12 days, before edging back to trade 0.1 percent lower on the day by 1606 GMT at $1.2895. While it has retained most of its gains against the dollar since May called the election seven weeks ago, sterling has fallen 2.5 percent in trade-weighted terms in less than four weeks since polls first suggested a narrowing lead for the Conservatives. U.S. positioning data shows speculative investors have flipped back to betting more against the pound; many hedge funds expect any recovery in sterling will be short-lived, regardless of the election result. One-week sterling-dollar implied volatility, which measures the cost of hedging against price swings in the currency pair, was at 12.5 percent, near its highest levels since Jan. 17, when May set out her Brexit strategy.

Prosecutors in Palermo issued a warrant to detain 15 suspects for people smuggling and trafficking in contraband cigarettes, according to a copy of the document seen by Reuters. All were Italian residents, but most were Tunisian-born. Twelve suspects have been detained so far and one speedboat impounded, along with two fishing boats and seven cars the group also used, police said. More than a half million migrants have poured into Italy since 2014, but most of them have paid far less to Libya-based smugglers (usually between $800 and $1,300) to board overcrowded and unseaworthy boats for a voyage that often ends in tragedy. Some 12,200 people have died in the past 3-1/2 years attempting the crossing. Those who did make it then spent several days at sea aboard rescue vessels and were funneled through Italy's official immigration system. The smugglers instead offered those wishing to reach Europe a safe voyage across some 200 km (124 miles) of sea in less than four hours, with the aim of arriving completely undetected.  The danger of this organization was this: It allowed irregular migrants to dodge all authorities and so could have transported people who should not be allowed in Italy or Europe,  Palermo Chief Prosecutor Francesco Lo Voi said.  In an intercepted telephone call, police overheard a potential client, who was not smuggled to Italy, saying he was hiding from Tunisian police and that he was worried about being stopped in Italy for  terrorism , the court document said.  Police said they verified five crossings, and each one earned the smugglers an estimated 40,000 euros.  During one voyage, police swooped in after 14 migrants had been dropped off in a cove near Marsala, Sicily. Some 100 kilos (220lb) in contraband cigarettes were also among the payload.  Had it not been stopped, the organization was capable of making at least two crossings per week, police said.

Elizabeth Gurrieri, a former manager of reimbursement services for Arizona-based Insys, will plead guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy, prosecutors said in a letter filed in Boston federal court on Monday. The filing is part of the criminal case against six ex-Insys executives and managers including former Chief Executive Michael Babich, who prosecutors say participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe the drug, Subsys. Gurrieri would become the second former Insys employee nationally to plead guilty in connection with Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray containing fentanyl, a highly addictive and regulated synthetic opioid. The Queen Creek, Arizona resident's agreement to cooperate came as Insys works to reach a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in connection with the investigation. Gurrieri's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. Insys declined to comment. It has said it is has been working to improve its compliance practices and is cooperating with authorities.    Prosecutors alleged in December that Babich and others led a conspiracy to bribe medical practitioners to unnecessarily prescribe Subsys through payments disguised as marketing event and speaker fees. Other defendants include former Insys vice presidents Alec Burlakoff and Michael Gurry; former national sales director Richard Simon; and former regional sales directors Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan. All six have pleaded not guilty. The case against Gurrieri related to what prosecutors said was a push by Insys to get insurers to cover the expensive price of Subsys, which in 2013 cost about $2,340 for 60 units. According to a separate criminal complaint, Gurrieri and others at Insys directed fraudulent schemes to deceive insurers and pharmacy benefit managers in order to obtain payment authorization for Subsys.  The complaint said Insys employees were taught to mislead insurers about the diagnosis of patients and whether they had tried and failed other preferred medications. Gurrieri also instructed employees to claim a cancer diagnosis regardless of the patient's history or whether Subsys was prescribed for a use not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the complaint said. The cases in U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, are U.S. v. Babich et al, No. 16-cr-10343, and U.S. v. Gurrieri, No. 17-cr-10083.

The Guardian newspaper said meat processing company JBS, which supplies beef to several leading UK food stores, had previously bought cattle from a farm in northern Brazil which is being investigated for using workers as modern-day slaves. JBS's headquarters in Brazil and its UK office would not immediately comment on the report but the Guardian quoted the company as saying it had stopped buying from the farm on discovering a possible link to labour abuses. Upmarket British food store Waitrose told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that it was pulling one of its three own brand corned beef products while it investigated.  While we have found no such concerns in our own supply chain ... we are taking these allegations seriously so have stopped sourcing any of our corned beef from there (JBS) while we investigate fully,  the supermarket said in a statement. JBS produce is also used in tinned corned beef sold by Marks & Spencer, Co-Op, Sainsbury's, Lidl and Princes, according to the Guardian, which added that some of these stores were now also investigating and examining their supply chains. Corned beef, a salt-cured product widely used during both world wars when fresh meat was rationed, remains popular in Britain where it is commonly used in sandwiches. The newspaper said documents showed JBS paid 2 million pounds ($2.58 million) between 2013 and 2016 for cattle reared on a farm in the state of Para where prosecutors say workers were being subjected to modern slavery. Brazilian police reportedly discovered men forced to live in inhumane and degrading conditions, with no shelter, toilets or drinking water. Prosecutors believe the workers were in debt bondage, the Guardian said. The 2016 Global Slavery Index estimated about 46 million people are in some form of modern slavery - forced into manual labour, trafficked to brothels, victims of debt bondage or born into servitude - with about 161,000 people in Brazil enslaved. JBS told the paper the farm was not included in the government's official  blacklist  of companies known to use slave labour.  As soon as JBS became aware of irregularities in the ... farm's operations in 2016, all livestock purchases from the (farm) were immediately stopped,  the Guardian quoted JBS as saying.  JBS does not buy cattle from any farms which have any association with slave labour, as listed by the Brazilian government.

His fund Greenlight Capital’s proposal to boost the automaker’s value by issuing a new class of dividend shares got a drubbing from investors at Tuesday’s annual meeting. Chief Executive Mary Barra can’t afford to gloat, though. The company’s stock is flatlining and plenty of speedbumps lie ahead.  Einhorn contended that splitting the stock into one class of shares entitled to the company’s dividend in perpetuity and a separate class entitled to any additional profit generated by growth would attract more investors. He also argued it would boost the company’s $52 billion market value by as much as $38 billion. GM countered that the plan would reduce its financial flexibility while doing nothing to improve the fundamentals of its business. It helped that Moody’s labeled the idea “credit-negative” and that proxy advisors Institutional Shareholders Services and Glass Lewis recommended shareholders reject it. They did so overwhelmingly, with more than 91 percent of those voting – 96 percent if Greenlight’s stake is excluded – backing the company.  The valuation issue that prompted the hedge-fund manager’s intervention hasn’t gone away, though. GM shares trade at just 5.59 times consensus earnings expectations for 2017, the lowest multiple of any profitable company in the S&P; 500 Index. At just over $34 a share, the stock is barely above the price at its initial public offering in November 2010. Barra hasn’t been standing still. She is aggressively refreshing GM’s vehicle lineup, agreed in February to sell the European business to PSA Group for $2.2 billion and expects to return $7 billion to shareholders this year through buybacks and dividends.  The company is heading towards nasty looking traffic, though. U.S. auto sales are softening and discounts are spreading to the sport utility vehicles and light trucks that generate a large chunk of Detroit’s profit. Spending heavily to develop electric cars and self-driving technology will make it even harder to maintain current levels of profitability.  Barra can take some comfort from Tuesday’s shareholder support. But Barra only has to look at crosstown rival Ford - which abruptly ejected Mark Fields last month – to realize how quickly that can evaporate. Steering GM to the future could yet be a rocky road.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The Renault team posted a teasing picture on Twitter of the 32-year-old removing his helmet after driving the 2012 Lotus E20 car at Valencia's Ricardo Tormo circuit.  So guys...we need to come clean about something,  the caption said.  It's true. It really is Robert Kubica,  the team added in a later post.  Back in one of our cars after six years.  The test took place amid considerable secrecy, with no advance notice given to the media and little information provided about the reasons for the private test.  So why did we keep it quiet? It was a private test, for Robert,  the team said, adding that the Pole had completed 115 laps with  the biggest smile  afterwards. Kubica, who in 2008 became the first Pole to win a Formula One race when he triumphed with BMW-Sauber in Canada, last drove a Formula One car with Renault in pre-season testing at the same circuit in February 2011. Renault have left and returned to the sport with their own team since then, with a current line-up of Germany's Nico Hulkenberg and Britain's Jolyon Palmer. The latter has yet to score a point in six races this season with increasing media speculation about his future ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix. Kubica's F1 career ended in the same month as his last test when he suffered severe arm, leg and hand injuries in a near-fatal crash during a minor rally in northern Italy that he had entered for fun. He had been one of the sport's brightest prospects before his accident, with a likely move to Ferrari on the horizon. Since his recovery he has competed in the world rally championship and tested other cars, including those used in Formula E and GP3.

The projection follows a strong first quarter for emerging market investment that saw the strongest portfolio inflows since 2014. The IIF's projection is $290 billion higher than its estimate just four months ago, shortly after Donald Trump took office as U.S. president and the organization listed possible American protectionism as its top threat to emerging market portfolio flow growth. The risk of trade friction between the U.S. and Mexico and China, has waned significantly, said Hung Tran, IIF's executive managing director, as has the risk of the U.S. Federal Reserve quickly tightening monetary policy.  Looking back at the first five months of the year, it is clear that near-term threats of trade conflict have subsided significantly,  Tran said.  All the threat of naming China as currency manipulators, the increase in tariffs, abandonment of NAFTA did not come to pass.  The IIF projects non-resident inflows to increase by $252 billion this year from 2016.  Non-resident portfolio inflows are expected to rise to more than $1 trillion in 2018, IIF also said, the first time inflows have breached that level since 2014. Capital inflows from non-residents had fallen to a 12-year low in 2015. Despite the rebound in capital inflows from foreigners, IIF anticipates overall net capital outflows from emerging markets, led by resident capital outflows from China. The organization expects resident capital outflows to hit $892 billion this year, a decline by $141 billion from 2016, and for outflows to reduce further in 2018.  Outflows from China alone, which leads emerging market economies in capital leaving local markets, rose to a record $725 billion last year.  All of this moderation is due to China, which has used capital controls to clamp down on outward investment with some degree of success,  said Scott Farnham, IIF's senior research analyst, global macroeconomics, in the report. All told, the institute is expecting to see overall net capital outflows, which includes resident and non-residents from emerging markets, of $130 billion. It had estimated outflows from its group of 25 emerging market economies would total $490 billion this year in its February report. The total level of capital outflows is greater than the difference between resident and non-resident flows because of forex reserves and net errors and omissions, IIF said.

Polling firm Opinium said the lead of May's Conservative Party over Labour had widened to seven points, up by a percentage point from its previous poll published on Saturday. The new poll was the first by a major firm that was conducted in its entirety after a deadly attack in London by Islamist militants on June 3. The field work ran from June 4-6. It put support for the Conservatives at 43 percent, unchanged from Saturday's poll, while Labour fell one point to 36 percent.  Labour's campaign surge appears to have crested as our final poll of the campaign is the first to see the Tory (Conservative) lead expand rather than contract,  said Opinium's head of political polling, Adam Drummond.  If this is the start of a trend, and it is supported by other work Opinium has done, then it is worth bearing in mind that at the last election 15 percent of voters made their mind up either on polling day or the day before.  British opinion polls have shown a wide range of estimates of support for the two main political parties, adding to scepticism among many critics who hammered the industry for failing to accurately predict the outcome of the 2015 election and last year's referendum vote to exit the European Union. However, all the polls have shown a steady narrowing of the lead of May's Conservatives over the past three weeks following the publication of the parties' election policy pledges. Opinium had a Conservative lead of 19 points over Labour early in the campaign. May began to struggle after she fielded a plan to make elderly people pay for more of their social care, even though she moved quickly to say there would be a limit on the amount of costs that people would face. In the wake of Saturday's attack on London by Islamist militants who killed seven people and injured 48, Opinium said its poll showed a significant rise in national security as an issue for voters - 11 percent said anti-terrorism policy would influence their vote, up from 2 percent last week. Respondents said May was the most trusted leader on fighting terrorism and on Brexit, while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was most trusted on Britain's health service. The Opinium poll made for more comfortable reading for May than another one published overnight by Survation which showed her lead over Labour had narrowed to just 1 percentage point. The Conservatives had a slim 17-seat majority before parliament was dissolved for the snap election. The poll, for ITV television, was conducted on Friday and Saturday, before the attack in London. It echoed another Survation poll, published for the Mail on Sunday newspaper, which also gave the Conservatives a one-point lead. No other poll has shown a lead that tight.

The blue chip FTSE 100 closed flat in percentage terms, while the more domestically-exposed mid cap index dropped more than 1 percent, its biggest one-day loss in two months. While large caps spent the majority of the trading session in negative territory, a dip in the British pound helped the blue chip index end broadly unchanged. “The direct impacts (from this election) are currency, very important especially for the FTSE 100 given how international it is,  Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management, said.  This time we’ve got a focus on corporate tax rates given what’s in the Labour manifesto, and personal income taxes and whether that would affect the consumption patterns for UK-listed companies.” Investors instead sought refuge in precious metals miners Fresnillo and Randgold Resources, which gained 3.2 percent and 2.7 percent respectively, while more defensive plays such as consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser and British American Tobacco were also in demand. Miners followed suit, reversing earlier losses as the pressure eased on the price of copper, which traded flat. Anglo American, Antofagasta and BHP Billiton were all up between 1.2 percent and 1.9 percent. Medical technology firm ConvaTec was the biggest individual faller, however, down 4 percent after two investors sold a higher stake via a placing. Luxury goods firm Burberry was also down 3.7 percent after HSBC cut its rating on the stock to  reduce  from  hold , citing a lack of visibility on the top line.  Every shareholder-friendly initiative seems to have been looked at to enable Burberry shares to be protected in the absence of what, in our view, would be the only real solid booster: a sustainable rebound in sales growth,  analysts at HSBC said in a note. Falls among mid caps were fairly broad-based, with outsourcer Capita, oilfield services provider Petrofac and support services firm Carillion all down more than 4.6 percent. AO World was the biggest mid-cap faller, dropping 10.7 percent and hitting its lowest level since July 2016 after the online retailer warned of a significant slowdown in UK sales growth in the first quarter.

Most speculative-grade rated healthcare companies in the U.S. will see earnings growth this year given the strong demand for healthcare services and innovation in available treatments,  says Megan Neuburger, Managing Director, U.S. Corporates.  However, headline risk will be a persistent backdrop.  Of the group of companies profiled in this year's edition of the Checkup, 22% currently have a Negative Rating Outlook--more than in past years. Most of these companies are healthcare providers, which face some of the greatest challenges adapting to a value-based care system. A number of financial metrics for the Checkup group of companies reflect the current challenges: Median leverage increased to 5.7x from 4.9x in 2016 as companies took on debt to complete acquisitions. Fitch expects these levels to normalize by year-end, as several companies are in the midst of balance sheet repair. The median free cash flow margin (FCF) fell versus the year-ago period, with healthcare providers generally tallying at or below the median, and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers generally tallying above it. Although most companies have addressed near-term maturities (Community Health Systems, Valeant, Tenet Healthcare and Select Medical Holdings have all addressed large maturities scheduled for next year), acute care hospitals represent 71% of all bonds and loans maturing for the Checkup group through 2019. Of the hospital companies profiled in the report,  only two companies, Quorum Healthcare and LifePoint Health, have very light near-term maturity schedules. Fitch identified six companies that have either a Negative Outlook or a deteriorating trajectory. They include Community Health Systems, DJO Finance, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Quorum Healthcare, and Kindred Healthcare. Two companies have a Positive Outlook or have an improving trajectory: Quintiles IMS Holdings and Hologic. Fitch's High-Yield Healthcare Checkup Handbook, published annually, analyzes the business profiles and capital structures of the 18 largest high-yield debt issuers in the U.S. healthcare industry. The companies profiled have a cumulative $155 billion of debt outstanding, including high-yield bonds and bank loans, up from $148 billion since last year's report.

Retailers led by large stores including Target, Best Buy and Autozone are trying to get Republicans to abandon the tax as a piece of any sweeping tax reform. The measure would impose a tax on imports while favoring domestic production.  The meetings, which will begin on Tuesday and conclude on Thursday, will include lawmakers and staff from several states including Arizona, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania, focusing on districts represented by members who have not taken a position on the tax or sit on the Ways and  Means Committee. They hope to convince them to oppose the tax. The meetings are the latest effort by retailers to lobby lawmakers to not support a tax they say would increase consumer prices for imported goods. U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has remained a driving force behind the border tax proposal, arguing that economic forces will keep the tax from raising consumer prices. The future of the tax remains shaky. President Donald Trump has refused to endorse it and many Republicans in the House and Senate are opposed. Furthermore, the effort to pass tax reform has stalled. Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said on Monday in a briefing with reporters that tax rate cuts remained a priority, a signal that sweeping tax reform could be dropped in favor of just reducing tax levels.

Retailers led by large stores including Target, Best Buy and Autozone are trying to get Republicans to abandon the tax as a piece of any sweeping tax reform. The measure would impose a tax on imports while favoring domestic production.  The meetings, which will begin on Tuesday and conclude on Thursday, will include lawmakers and staff from several states including Arizona, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania, focusing on districts represented by members who have not taken a position on the tax or sit on the Ways and  Means Committee. They hope to convince them to oppose the tax. The meetings are the latest effort by retailers to lobby lawmakers to not support a tax they say would increase consumer prices for imported goods. U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has remained a driving force behind the border tax proposal, arguing that economic forces will keep the tax from raising consumer prices. The future of the tax remains shaky. President Donald Trump has refused to endorse it and many Republicans in the House and Senate are opposed. Furthermore, the effort to pass tax reform has stalled. Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said on Monday in a briefing with reporters that tax rate cuts remained a priority, a signal that sweeping tax reform could be dropped in favor of just reducing tax levels. But Joshua Baca, a spokesman for the coalition opposing the tax called Americans for Affordable Products, said they will continue to fight against it.  The fight is not done.

Palermo was only the 36th most visited city in Italy in 2015 but Mayor Leoluca Orlando says it is set to be in the top 10 this year, marking a turnaround for the Sicilian capital that was once a Mafia battleground shunned by outsiders. The United Nations cultural body UNESCO recognized the city's Norman-Arab heritage in 2015, the growing migrant population is being absorbed into the fabric of society, and next year Palermo will be feted as Italy's capital of culture.  Palermo used to be the capital of the Mafia, then the capital of the anti-Mafia, today it is the capital of culture,  Orlando told Reuters in an interview. Orlando, 70, is seeking re-election at a June 11 ballot and says the tourist surge is a testament to his success in helping Palermo overcome its troubled past and slowly recover from the worst economic downturn in recent history. The vote pits the veteran Orlando against a revived center-right and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, making the ballot a barometer of national political sentiment ahead of a general election that is due by next May. Opinion polls show that while the 5-Star leads the field across Sicily, it will struggle to unseat Orlando, partly because of their own divisions in the port city, but also because of their rival's tenacity. People are seen in Bologni Square in the city centre of Palermo, Italy June 4, 2017. Picture taken June 4, 2017.Guglielmo MangiapaneMayor of Palermo for 16 of the last 32 years, Orlando does not belong to any party and refuses to let the center-left groups backing him, including ex-Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party, use their symbols on ballot papers.  I was anti-establishment before the Five Star existed. I don't have any party. My party is called Palermo,  said Orlando, whose reputation was built on his strong anti-Mafia stance in the 1980s and 1990s, when mobsters held sway across the island. Concerted political and legal action over the past two decades has hammered the organized crime networks. But instead of reaping the benefits, Sicily suffered fresh trauma with the global financial crisis that hit the island like a tsunami. Slideshow (2 Images)Palermo's jobless rate stands at 25 percent and youth unemployment is 70 percent, according to Italy's CGIL union, double the national average. Opponents acknowledge that Orlando has restored some of Palermo's faded splendor, but accuse him of focusing more on tourists than helping impoverished city residents. More than half a million tourists from cruise ships arrived last year, up from 390,000 in 2010. Arrivals of migrants have also been surging. Some 560,000 have reached Italy over the past 3-1/2 years, with 12,200 drowning in the attempt.  I think one day there will be another Nuremberg trial over what is going on in the Mediterranean,  Orlando said, referring to the war crimes tribunal at the end of World War Two. Unlike many Italian mayors, Orlando has warmly embraced the migrant cause, saying Sicily's long history as an ethnic melting pot explains his openness.  This is not a European city. It is a Middle Eastern city in Europe,  he said. Editing by Mark Heinrich","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-sicily-orlando-idUSKBN18X23G"},

The government statistics agency said on Monday consumer prices were up 0.23 percent last month, taking twelve-month inflation to 4.37 percent, closer to the central bank's long-term target of 2 percent to 4 percent. The seven-member board has been grappling with the twin pressures of weak economic growth and high inflation. But given the May figure was below the 0.30 percent predicted by analysts, policymakers may now be more comfortable with a sharper rate cut than the 25 basis points trimmed last month.  It should be highlighted that the inflation results are good news for this central bank board meeting,  brokerage Alianza said in a note to investors.  It has been a key figure in the latest monetary policy decisions.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is probing whether NSE employees gave some algorithmic and high-frequency traders preferential access to NSE servers. The investigation is delaying NSE's planned initial public offering, expected to be worth up to $1 billion, and the sources said the bourse wanted to settle the issue and move on. NSE disclosed in December it had hired a consultancy firm to look into the matter, but the consultants had been unable to prove collusion between brokers and NSE employees. Local media reported last week that the regulator had sent notifications to several NSE employees, requesting more information. SEBI has not publicly spoken about the case, leaving unclear where the probe stands. The sources said NSE officials were keen to move ahead with the IPO, and said the exchange would be willing to settle, without admitting wrong-doing, and accept a penalty. The exchange filed for the listing in December but has yet to gain the regulator's approval.  A mechanism is being worked out to reach a settlement with SEBI, but a penalty is inevitable,  said one of the sources. Both sources declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the talks. Emails to NSE and SEBI went unanswered. As part of its disclosure in December, NSE said it had set aside all revenue from the related servers for the past 2-1/2 years amounting to 13.1 billion rupees ($192 million), or close to 30 percent of its total revenues during that period. NSE's foreign shareholders, keen for an exit, have been pushing the bourse for a faster listing for more than a year and the timing of the IPO had caused friction in the past. The second source said top investors were looking for  certainty and clarity  on the issue and added that they understand that the matter is  not really under our control.   We are not having any stress or tension on the stakeholder front, which we had earlier,  said the source.  We want to get on with our lives.

SDF spokesman Talal Silo told Reuters the battle started on Monday and the fighting would be fierce  because Daesh (Islamic State) will die to defend their so-called capital . The assault overlaps with the final stages of the U.S.-backed attack to recapture the Iraqi city of Mosul from Islamic State. It follows months of advances to the north, east and west of Raqqa by the SDF, which includes Arab and Kurdish militias. Islamic State captured Raqqa from rebel groups in 2014 and has used it as an operations base to plan attacks in the West. Silo said the assault had begun from the north, east and west of the city, which is bordered to the south by the River Euphrates. The commander of the Raqqa campaign, Rojda Felat, told Reuters SDF fighters were attacking the al-Mishlab district at the city's southeastern outskirts, confirming an earlier report by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.   The coalition has a big role in the success of the operations. In addition to warplanes, there are coalition forces working side by side with the SDF,  Silo said by phone from the Hukoumiya farms area, 10 km (6 miles) north of Raqqa, where the SDF later declared the start of the assault. A Reuters witness at the location could hear the sound of heavy shelling and air strikes in the distance. The U.S.-led coalition said the fight for Raqqa would be  long and difficult  but would deliver a  decisive blow to the idea of ISIS (Islamic State) as a physical caliphate . Hard Fighting  It's hard to convince new recruits that ISIS is a winning cause when they just lost their twin 'capitals' in both Iraq and Syria,  Lt. Gen Steve Townsend, the coalition commanding general, said in a coalition statement.   We all saw the heinous attack in Manchester, England,  said Townsend.  ISIS threatens all of our nations, not just Iraq and Syria, but in our own homelands as well. This cannot stand.   Once ISIS is defeated in both Mosul and (Raqqa), there will still be a lot of hard fighting ahead,  he said. From Monday afternoon to Tuesday afternoon, coalition warplanes and artillery hit IS boats, tactical units, fighting positions, vehicles and a weapons store, spokesman Col. Ryan Dillon said.  The coalition struck 19 boats that jihadists were using to ferry fighters and equipment across the Euphrates - their only means of accessing the city from land they control on the south bank, he said.  Security officials in the West have warned of increased threat of attacks such as last month's Manchester suicide bombing and Saturday's attack in London as Islamic State loses ground in Syria and Iraq. Both attacks were claimed by Islamic State.       An Arab group fighting with the SDF, the Syrian Elite Forces, which was established in February, had entered al-Mishlab with coalition air support, its spokesman Mohammed al-Shaker said by phone.   The Syrian Elite Forces one or two hours ago entered the first quarter of Raqqa, which is al-Mishlab quarter, via the eastern front,  he said.  The Observatory said the SDF had captured some buildings in the al-Mishlab area and Islamic State fighters had withdrawn from parts of the district. The Observatory also said an attack was underway against a military barracks, Division 17, on the northern outskirts of Raqqa. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) spokesman Talal Silo speaks during a news conference in Hukoumiya village in Raqqa, Syria June 6, 2017.Rodi SaidThe U.S.-led coalition has said 3,000-4,000 Islamic State fighters are thought to be holed up in Raqqa city, where they have erected defences against the anticipated assault. The city is about 90 km (56 miles) from the border with Turkey. The SDF includes the powerful Kurdish YPG militia. Fighting around Raqqa since late last year has displaced tens of thousands of people, with many flooding camps in the area and others stranded in the desert. Civilian Deaths The U.N. human rights office has raised concerns about increasing reports of civilian deaths as air strikes escalate. The Raqqa campaign has  resulted in massive civilian casualties, displacement and serious infrastructure destruction  so far, it said in a May report. Islamic State militants have also reportedly been preventing civilians from leaving, it said. The U.S.-led coalition says it tries to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and Iraq and investigates any allegations.  It is unclear how many civilians remain in Raqqa.  U.N. humanitarian spokesman Jens Laerke told Reuters that, for its planning purposes, the United Nations estimates there are approximately 160,000 people left in Raqqa city, but said this was not a formal estimate.  Humanitarian aid organization International Rescue Committee said 200,000 people were still trapped inside, and warned civilians in Raqqa risk being killed by Islamic State snipers or mines if they try to flee but could be used by the militants as human shields if they remain.  The IRC has seen a drop in the number of people escaping Raqqa over the past week,  its Middle East Director of Public Affairs Thomas Garofalo said, adding this may indicate Islamic State intended to use them as human shields.   Dillon said the SDF had encouraged civilians to quit Raqqa to avoid this fate and had set up screening centers on front lines to separate civilian refugees from fleeing fighters.  He said the coalition expected IS to use similar tactics to those it had employed during the months-long battle in Mosul, including the use of armored car bombs as its  weapon of choice .  They have had three years to establish their defences there. We expect a fight very similar to what we've seen in Mosul,  he said, while adding that Raqqa is a much smaller city.  The Raqqa campaign has been the source of tension between the United States and Turkey, which fears growing Kurdish influence in northern Syria and has lobbied Washington to abandon its Kurdish YPG allies. The YPG has been the main partner for the United States in its campaign against Islamic State in Syria, where the group is also being fought in separate campaigns waged by the Russian-backed Syrian government and Free Syrian Army rebel groups.   The United States last week said it had started distributing arms to the YPG to help take Raqqa. The SDF has said it will hand control of Raqqa to a civilian council after its capture, as in other areas the SDF took from Islamic State. The SDF and YPG control a swathe of northeastern Syria from the Iraqi border to the city of Manbij on the western banks of the Euphrates. The main Kurdish groups and their allies have established autonomous administration in the areas under their control, which they aim to preserve in any peace deal.

Omran Daqneesh and his father appeared in a video clip, apparently still living in Aleppo telling the reporter, Kinana Allouche, he didn't want to leave Syria. A photograph of the wounded boy, sitting blankly and alone in the back of an ambulance after an airstrike, was circulated worldwide last August, highlighting the suffering of civilians in besieged east Aleppo. His older brother, Ali, died from his wounds after the attack. Daqneesh's father told the reporter his son was in good health in Aleppo - now under the control of President Bashar al-Assad's forces. He said he had cut his son's hair and changed his name to protect him from being kidnapped and accused rebels of intimidating the family. It was not clear whether the family had been coerced into taking part in the short video posted on Facebook, the first time the boy had been seen publicly since he was wounded. However, Valerie Szybala from the Syria Institute, an independent research organisation focused on Syria, said the family was unlikely to have been speaking freely.  They are under government control now and this is a government that we know arrests and tortures anyone that speaks out against it ... to me the situation seems to suggest this is probably coerced,  Szybala told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Rebel resistance in Aleppo ended last December after years of fighting and months of bitter siege and bombardment that culminated in a bloody retreat, as insurgents agreed to withdraw in a ceasefire.  Syria's civil war, which erupted in 2011 has killed an estimated 465,000 people.

The two agencies said the reprieve technically constituted a default under their ratings definitions, given the company widely known as RCom would miss loan payments. RCom secured the reprieve after promising lenders it would complete two key deals - the merger of its wireless division with rival Aircel and the sale of a stake in its mobile masts business - that would allow it cut its $7 billion debt by 60 percent. But the agencies warned RCom's debt levels could remain unsustainable even if it completes the two transactions. Moody's Investors Service said RCom would still have $3 billion in remaining debt and uncertainty about whether it could generate enough cash flow after the two deals. Fitch Ratings similarly warned RCom, India's seventh-ranked mobile carrier by users, would be saddled with  excessive  debt. The downgrades - coming just days after both agencies had cut Reliance debt deeper into so-called  junk  territory - will cast a further shadow over prospects for RCom, which has seen its market value slump by a third since early May amid worries about its debt levels.  Given the heavy debt load and the uncertainty regarding the cash flow-generating capabilities of the residual businesses post demerger and asset sales, Moody's believes the capital structure of the remaining business will remain weak,  the agency said in a statement. Moody's downgraded the company to  Ca  from  Caa1,  while Fitch downgraded it to  Restricted Default (RD)  from  CCC.  Fitch also downgraded RCom's 6.5 percent senior secured notes due on 2020 to  C/RR4  from  CCC/RR4.  RCom's shares gained 0.7 percent on Monday after the company announced the reprieve on Friday. But they resumed their losses on Tuesday, ending down 3.1 percent. Costly airwave auctions have bruised India's telecom sector, but it was a price war triggered by the arrival last year of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd that brought the sector to its knees.

The country's banking sector is still recovering after the state had to rescue two lenders in 2014 and 2015, their problems exacerbated by massive bad loans, while many clients lost their life's savings by buying into toxic assets sold to them as safe. In a financial stability report released on Tuesday, the Bank of Portugal said that despite stronger solvency and loan-to-deposit ratios, the high stock of non-performing loans and assets tends to weigh on investor perception of Portuguese lenders, restricting their access to market financing.  Although the prospects for the Portuguese economy have improved ... the high public and private sector indebtedness and the low potential growth continue to pose risks to financial stability,  it said, adding that record-low interest rates in the euro zone put additional pressure on Portuguese banks. It warned that in such a setting, banks could be tempted to launch complex financial instruments that allow to recover some of the lost profitability by transferring risks to clients, which could create reputation hazards and undermine confidence in the banking sector.  This context could also create incentives for excessive risk-taking via search-for-yield behaviours, particularly by being less restrictive in conceding loans... It is fundamental that financial institutions correctly evaluate risks linked to new loan flows,  the central bank said. It said it was important for banks to heed its warning as new consumer and housing loans were on the rise even as the total stock of loans to the non-financial private sector still ebbed last year, continuing the trend that started during the country's financial crisis in 2010.

The yen and gold also gained amid prevailing caution as an Arab rift opened up around Qatar, and ahead of testimony from the former head of the FBI, a British election and the European Central Bank's next move, which all happen on Thursday. Wall Street was lower for a second day after both European and Asian stocks dropped during their sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 31.09 points, or 0.15 percent, to 21,152.95, the S&P; 500 lost 5 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,431.1 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.70 points, or 0.11 percent, to 6,288.98.  We've had a little bit of a cooling off in equities following the breaking of links with Qatar - a lot of people think it may force oil prices lower and remove some of the inflationary pressures,  said RBC economist Cathal Kennedy.  As those pressures ease, it pushes out the horizon for interest rate rises.  On what BayernLB analysts called  Super Thursday , British voters will also go to polls in an increasingly unpredictable general election, the European Central Bank is due to meet and later the same day and former FBI director James Comey will testify before Congress.  We have a big week or so ahead of us with the UK heading to the polls and the ECB announcing its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday and the Federal Reserve doing the same next Wednesday,  said Craig Erlam, a market analyst for OANDA securities.  Once these events pass, we may have a little more clarity and therefore see a little less caution in the markets.  The diplomatic spat in the Middle East left oil prices hovering just below $50 a barrel and this, in turn, hit European stocks, which tumbled across the board. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.66 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.25 percent. The broad Euro STOXX 600 was down 0.7 percent while German stocks were down 1.05 percent. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.2 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.95 percent. U.S. crude fell 0.38 percent to $47.22 per barrel and Brent was last at $49.19, down 0.57 percent on the day. Investors instead bought gold, U.S. Treasuries and German government bonds - some of the safest assets in the world - thrusting gold prices to seven-week highs and German 10-year borrowing costs to six-week lows. U.S. Treasury yields dropped to a seven-month low of 2.129 percent at one stage . It is a move that has come despite the Federal Reserve widely expected to raise U.S. interest rates next week, but also follows a run of weaker-than-expected U.S. data. Erlam of OANDA said another area for concern is how steady sterling has been - about flat against both the dollar and the euro  - potentially a sign of complacency before the election. The lead of British Prime Minister Theresa May over the opposition Labour Party ahead of Thursday's general election has narrowed to just 1 percentage point, according to a poll conducted before the attacks in London on Saturday. Other polls in recent days have found bigger leads for the Conservatives of up to 11 and 12 points. The dollar, meanwhile, was fell to a more than six-week low against the yen and was at its weakest since the November U.S. election against a basket of other world currencies. The dip came ahead of Comey's expected testimony on Thursday. Reports suggest the former FBI chief plans to talk about conversations in which U.S. President Trump allegedly pressured him to drop his investigation into former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials.

Grab bought Indonesian payment service Kudo earlier this year, and Tan said Grab is seeking more acquisitions to support rapid growth.  You will see more happening across the region with GrabPay.

A diplomatic rift between Qatar and several Arab states including Saudi Arabia has depressed oil prices as it could undermine efforts by OPEC to tighten the market. Combined with doubts about the U.S. economy and President Donald Trump's ambitious spending plans, the oil slide is clouding the outlook for price growth globally. In turn, this weak outlook is keeping demand high for bonds, even though the European Central Bank is expected on Thursday to take a more benign view of the economy and potentially close the door to further stimulus.  There is a general risk aversion theme going on,  said Mizuho's head of euro rates strategy, Peter Chatwell.  The evolution of data in the U.S. has also justified the drop in global government bond yields, and is why investors in Europe feel comfortable at these levels.  Britain's election on Thursday, which some pollsters indicate could result in a hung parliament, is also spreading a cautious tone across markets in general. German Bund yields fell to their lowest level in nearly six weeks at 0.25 percent. French equivalents fell below 0.70 percent for the first time since early January, narrowing the gap over German yields to 39 basis points - the tightest in almost a month. An outperformance in French bonds came after polls suggested that Emmanuel Macron's party is set to win the biggest parliamentary majority for a French president since Charles de Gaulle's 1968 landslide. Still, the fall in yields was widespread across euro zone markets. Spanish 10-year yields dropped as much as 5 bps to 1.52 percent, just above four-month lows, while Irish yields hit five-month lows at 0.73 percent. Oil prices have shed around 8 percent over the last 10 days - a slide that has further eroded long-term inflation expectations in the euro zone. The five-year, five-year forward rate has slid more than 20 bps since the start of the year to below 1.6 percent - well short of the ECB's near-2-percent inflation target. Adding to the political tension, former FBI director James Comey is due to testify before the U.S. Congress on Thursday. He may discuss his conversations with U.S. President Donald Trump about an investigation into former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials. Investors see this as a distraction for Trump, who they are banking on to reflate the stuttering U.S. economy with ambitious spending plans. In the U.S., long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell to their lowest levels since November. Editing by Larry King","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds-idUSL8N1J320X"},

The threat of losses is likely to strengthen German calls to wind down the ECB's 2.3 trillion euro purchase programme, aimed at boosting the euro zone's economy, ahead of general elections in September. The ECB will hold its policy meeting on Thursday and is expected to reiterate its plan to extend the money-printing scheme at least until the end of the year despite a recent rebound in inflation. ECB purchases have depleted the German government debt market, forcing it and the Bundesbank, which carries out the bulk of the purchases in Germany, to buy short-dated, loss-making paper to meet their monthly purchase target. The average German public sector bond bought by the two central banks in May had a maturity of just four years -- the shortest since the scheme was launched in March 2015. This means it was likely to yield around -0.58 percent at Tuesday's prices, a guaranteed loss for the ECB and Bundesbank that will not be fully compensated by the 0.4 percent charge that they impose on banks for storing their excess cash overnight. The Bundesbank has been setting aside money for potential losses on bonds bought under the scheme. But if it were to need capital as a result of even larger losses, this would fall upon the taxpayer. On top of market constraints, the ECB is running against many of its self-imposed limits. Its purchases of Portuguese bonds dwindled to a record low of 504 million euros, less than half what its rule would dictate, in May as the ECB tried to avoid hitting a limit on how many bonds it can own from each country.

Data from Statistics South Africa showed the first quarter contraction was led by weak manufacturing and trade, suggesting high unemployment and stagnant wages were dragging down South Africa's long-resilient consumer sector, analysts said. Political instability, high unemployment and credit ratings downgrades have dented business and consumer confidence in South Africa and the rand ZAR=D3 extended its losses against the dollar, while government bonds also weakened ZAR186=. South Africa's economy contracted by 0.7 percent in the first three months of 2017 after shrinking by 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, lagging market expectations of a quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion of 0.9 percent. It was the first time two consecutive quarters showed contraction - the definition of recession - since the second quarter of 2009, although there have been individual quarters of negative growth in more recent years. A consumer frenzy helped the South African economy grow by an average 5 percent a year in the five years before the 2009 recession, but it has struggled to register much growth since.  The slowdown in Q1 was due to much worse results from usually stable consumer-facing sectors that had been the key drivers of growth in recent years,  Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said. The worst performing sector was trade, catering and accommodation, which contracted by 5.9 percent, while manufacturing - one of the key sectors - fell by 3.7 percent. Standard Chartered Bank's Chief Africa Economist Razia Khan said the  awful  data showed weakness where it was not expected.

The Treasury said the negative economic growth was a risk to fiscal targets and introduced  significant downward bias  to this year's growth estimate of 1.3 percent, up from 0.3 percent in 2016.  The current state of the economy puts more pressure on us as government, business, labor and broader society to intensify our growth program and improve confidence as a matter of urgency to arrest the decline and set the economy on a higher growth trajectory,  the Treasury said in a statement. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba would meet business leaders soon to discuss ways to achieve inclusive economic growth, the Treasury said.

The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, published on Tuesday also suggests that a recent moderation in job growth could be the result of a skills mismatch rather than easing demand for labor.  These data underscore the difficulty in hiring new workers, which we think is increasingly likely to be a factor restraining payroll growth going forward,  said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.  The Fed becomes somewhat uneasy when the labor market becomes too tight and this report supports the Fed's case to nudge rates higher next week.  JOLTS is one of the metrics on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard of labor market indicators. It came ahead of the U.S. central bank's June 13-14 policy meeting, at which it is expected to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 259,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.0 million in April, the highest since the government started tracking the series in 2000.  The monthly increase was the largest in just over a year and pushed the jobs openings rate to 4.0 percent, the highest since last July, from 3.8 percent in March.  Hiring, however, decreased by 253,000 jobs to 5.1 million. That lowered the hiring rate to a one-year low of 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent in March. A man speaks with a job recruiter at the Nassau County Mega Job Fair at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York October 7, 2014.Shannon StapletonThe gap between job openings and hiring points to a growing skills mismatch. A report from the National Federation of Independent Business last week showed the share of small business owners reporting job openings they could not fill in May was the highest since November 2000. Full Employment The economy created 138,000 in May, well below the average monthly job gains of 181,000 over the prior 12 months. Economists believe tightening labor market conditions could soon unleash a faster pace of wage growth. Wage gains have remained sluggish even as the unemployment rate has tumbled to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. The JOLTS report also showed 1.6 million people were laid off in April, little changed from March. The layoffs and discharges rate was unchanged at 1.1 percent for five straight months. The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs fell by 111,000 to 3.0 million in April.  As a result, the quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence, dipped to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent in March.  The economy has already reached the nirvana of full employment. At full employment the focus shifts from worries about the demand for labor to concerns about the supply of labor,  said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.  There aren't enough workers to man the factories and stock the store shelves. The supply demand imbalance is only likely to grow worse as the baby boom generation retires.

Egypt last year scrapped a ban on ergot in grain imports after it effectively halted purchase tenders because trading houses refused to participate, saying the ban was an impossible requirement. In its place, Egypt imposed a more internationally standard 0.05 percent tolerance threshold for ergot and restructured its food inspection system, transferring responsibility for strategic agricultural imports from the agriculture ministry's quarantine body, which favored the ban, to the trade ministry. A ruling scheduled for next week will scrap that new system, effectively reinstating the ergot ban, according to lawyers who were informed of the court's decision verbally on Tuesday. The verdict is expected to be formally announced on June 13 and is subject to appeal but must be implemented during the appeal process, said Khaled Ali, one of the lawyers on the case. An agriculture ministry spokesman told Reuters the inspection system for grain imports remained unchanged, as did the permitted level of ergot in wheat shipments - currently 0.05 percent. The trade ministry declined to comment. Return to Uncertainty The case was brought by a group of quarantine inspection employees in their capacity as citizens, not by the body itself, as well as several other parties, including some connected to the health ministry, which also takes part in inspections. The inspectors involved said the new system illegally stripped the quarantine body of its authority and handed it to a trade ministry body ill-equipped to oversee inspections, allowing imports to enter with hazardous contaminants harmful to plant and human health.  All that mattered to us in this, is that this decision, when it was issued, allowed for the entry of things at levels that would harm people – like ergot, ambrosia, and white mould,  said Mohamed Zaki, a quarantine inspector who raised one of the cases. Grains traders have said a zero tolerance ergot policy makes doing business with Egypt too risky given the costly possibility that their cargoes may be rejected upon arrival.   My worry is this decision could lead to a return to uncertainty and even a disruption of Egypt's wheat imports just as the situation has been returning to normal,  one German trader said, echoing the sentiment of several others. Egypt last month purchased about 500,000 tonnes of wheat in tenders held by its state-grain buyer GASC. Turnout among traders has returned to normal following several boycotts last year in response to the zero policy. The current system was imposed by a decree in November that named the General Organization for Export and Import Control (GOEIC), which is part of the trade ministry, as the body responsible for inspecting the imports.

But he said he did not regret the clash with Milliyet newspaper reporter Bilal Mese on the flight back from Macedonia, where Turkey drew 0-0 on Monday, saying Mese had insulted him during the Euro 2016 tournament hosted by France. Broadcaster CNN Turk quoted Mese as saying Turan attacked him shortly after boarding the plane, hurling insults and swinging punches at him despite being restrained by another journalist, a security guard, and team personnel on board. He said he would take legal action against Turan.  At first, I thought he was joking...Then, one of his punches swung by,  CNN Turk quoted Mese as saying. Commenting on the events on the flight to Slovenia, where Turkey will train before a World Cup qualifier in Kosovo on Sunday, Turan said the reporter had spread rumours and slander and insulted his family values while covering Euro 2016.  I made a mistake while wearing the national team uniform. It was something that should not have happened on the national team plane,  he said, adding however that he felt no remorse.  Do I regret it?

In a statement, police said they served five arrest warrants, 22 search-and-seizure warrants and brought in six people for questioning. Federal prosecutors said in an emailed statement that one of the men arrested was Henrique Eduardo Alves, a former tourism minister. Former lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha, who is already in prison, also fell under the scope of investigation. Both Alves and Cunha were also targeted because of developments in a fraud investigation at the Caixa Economica Federal [CEF.UL], prosecutors said. The bank is Brazil's largest mortgage lender. There was no immediate response to calls for comment from   representatives for Alves and Cunha. Last June, Alves resigned as President Michel Temer's tourism minister after accusations that he had taken bribes.

According to the police statement, contracts for the construction of the stadium were inflated by a total of 77 million reais ($23.4 million) to fund bribes to lawmakers. The case could heighten pressure on Temer, who faces calls for his ouster after he was caught on tape allegedly condoning bribes to silence a key potential witness in the country's sweeping three-year-old corruption investigation, known as Operation Car Wash.

May said Britain must be tougher in stamping out Islamist extremism after three knife-wielding assailants rammed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed others nearby. Following the third militant attack in Britain in less than three months, May said Thursday's election would go ahead and that Britain had been far too tolerant of extremism.   Violence can never be allowed to disrupt the democratic process,  May, who served as interior minister from 2010 to 2016, said outside her Downing Street office on Sunday. Islamic State, which is losing territory in Syria and Iraq to an offensive backed by a U.S.-led coalition, said its militants were responsible for the attack, though it is unclear what links the attackers had to the group. London police chief Cressida Dick said that while some of the recent attacks in Britain had international links, they had a largely domestic center of gravity. May said the three recent attacks, which have claimed at least 34 lives, are not thought to be connected.  But she said Britain was under threat from a new breed of crude copycat militants who might not have spent years plotting or even been radicalized online. Deadly attacks by Islamist militants in Paris, Nice, Brussels, Berlin, Manchester and London over recent years have shocked Europeans already anxious over security challenges from mass immigration and pockets of domestic Islamist radicalism.  In an early morning raids in east London, British counter-terrorism police detained more people on Monday. Police arrested 12 people in the Barking district of east London following the attack, though one was later released. Related CoverageUK police have 'robust' plans for election security - May's spokeswomanBritain's opposition leader calls on May to quit over police cutsRecent UK attacks have 'domestic center of gravity': London police chiefPolice have not released the names of the attackers and British newspapers refrained from identifying the men.  This has been a truly ghastly few weeks,  said London police chief Dick, who said the spell of recent attacks was unprecedented in her working experience which began in 1983. May was due to chair a meeting of the government's emergency response committee on Monday. Shadow of Attacks It was not immediately clear how the attack would impact the election, though the issue of security has been thrust to the forefront of the campaign after the London Bridge and Manchester attacks. Pedestrians walk past newly erected barriers separating the road from the pavement on Westminster Bridge following an attack which left 7 people dead and dozens of injured in central London, Britain, June 5, 2017.Estelle ShirbonThe campaign was suspended for several days last month when a suicide bomber killed 22 people at a concert by U.S. pop singer Ariana Grande in Manchester. Grande gave an emotional performance on Sunday at a benefit gig in the city for the victims of the attack, singing with a choir of local schoolchildren, including some who had been at her show. Before the London Bridge attack, May's gamble on a June 8 snap election had been thrust into doubt after polls showed her Conservative Party's lead had collapsed in recent weeks. [L8N1J007E] While British pollsters all predict May will win the most seats in Thursday's election, they have given an array of different numbers for how big her win will be, ranging from a landslide victory to a much more slender win without a majority. Some polls indicate the election could be close, possibly throwing Britain into political deadlock just days before formal Brexit talks with the European Union are due to begin on June 19. Slideshow (19 Images)Uk Security  May called the snap election in a bid to strengthen her hand in negotiations on Britain's exit from the European Union, to win more time to deal with the impact of the divorce and to strengthen her grip on the Conservative Party. If she fails to beat handsomely the 12-seat majority her predecessor David Cameron won in 2015, her electoral gamble will have failed and her authority will be undermined both inside the Conservative Party and at talks with 27 other EU leaders. May said the series of attacks were not connected in terms of planning and execution, but were inspired by what she called a  single, evil ideology of Islamist extremism  that represented a perversion of Islam and of the truth. But as a former interior minister, May's record on security is also under scrutiny - police numbers were reduced every year under her watch and as Home Secretary she oversaw the domestic intelligence agency, MI5. While she was interior minister, police numbers decreased every year. In March 2016 there were 124,066 police officers in England and Wales compared to 143,734 in March 2010. Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticized May for cutting police numbers and repeated his pledge to recruit 10,000 new police officers, including armed officers.  The mass murderers who brought terror to our streets in London and Manchester want our election to be halted. They want democracy halted,  Corbyn said in Carlisle, northern England.  They want their violence to overwhelm our right to vote in a fair and peaceful election and to go about our lives freely.

If confirmed, the plans, which media said also envisage the construction of some 1,800 other settler homes in the West Bank, are likely to deliver a further serious blow to efforts to revive the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process. A spokeswoman for the military-run Civil Administration in the West Bank of which the panel is a part declined to comment on the reports.  Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement group that monitors settlement activity in the West Bank, could not immediately confirm the reports but said the panel was due to discuss further building plans for the occupied territory on Wednesday. The reported move follows an Israeli government decision in March to build the new settlement, known as Amichai. It will house some 300 settlers evicted in February from another settlement called Amona.  Israel's Supreme Court ordered the removal of the Amona settlers after ruling that their homes had been built illegally on privately-owned Palestinian land. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to re-house them at a new site in the West Bank. According to the media reports, the panel approved plans to build 102 homes at the Amichai site for the Amona settlers. Plans for another 1,800 dwellings in several existing settlements were also ratified, the reports said.

The U.S. president did not speak publicly about the settlements during a May 22-23 visit to Jerusalem and the West Bank, though he urged Israeli and Palestinian leaders to  make a deal  for peace that would entail compromise and tough decisions. At a White House meeting with Netanyahu in February, Trump appeared to catch the Israeli leader off-guard when he urged him to  hold back on settlements for a little bit . Most countries view settlements that Israel has built on land captured in the 1967 Middle East war as illegal. Israel disputes that and cites biblical, historical and political links to the West Bank, as well as security interests. About 400,000 settlers and 2.8 million Palestinians live in the West Bank.

Deuba has previously served three times as prime minister, in 1995-1997, 2001-2002 and 2004-2005. Nepal's last monarch King Gyanendra called him incompetent and fired him in 2002 for failing to contain a Maoist insurgency and hold elections.  He was later reinstated only to be sacked again in 2005, triggering political unrest that toppled the 239-year-old monarchy three years later. Parliament Speaker Onsari Gharti said the 70-year-old Deuba won 388 votes of the 558 cast in the 593-member parliament to head the country's 10th government in as many years. Deuba's immediate task is to complete the two-phase local elections on June 28, a precondition for holding a national election by the end of the year. The first phase of local polls, in which less than half the country voted, was in mid-May.  I am committed to hold the second phase of local elections ... as well as state and parliamentary polls in a free and impartial manner on schedule,  Deuba, dressed in skin-tight trousers, a knee-long Nepali robe and black cap, said in an address to parliament before being elected.

The two leaders have struck an unlikely power-sharing deal which is expected to hold until the national elections. The deal, made last year when Prachanda - who goes by one name - was elected prime minister, was designed to organize elections to local bodies that have not been held since 1997 due to conflict and political instability.

Kunda Dixit, editor of the weekly Nepali Times, said Deuba's track record did not inspire a great deal of confidence.  He comes with a lot of baggage,  Dixit told Reuters.

The announcement by Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta follows President Donald Trump in April ordering a review of the U.S. visa program as part of his  America First  campaign pledge. The April executive order specifically entailed a review of the H-1B visa program, which is routinely used by technology firms like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp and Infosys Ltd to bring skilled foreign workers, such as engineers and programmers, to jobs in the United States. Critics of the program, including Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller, have argued that the laws governing these visas are lax and make it too easy for companies to replace U.S. workers with less-expensive foreign labor. The U.S. Labor Department and Department of Homeland Security each play a role in reviewing the applications for foreign guest workers. In April, Homeland Security said it was planning to take steps as well to prevent fraud in the H-1B visa program. On Tuesday, the Labor Department said its new policy will be to  enforce vigorously all laws within its jurisdiction governing the administration and enforcement of non-immigrant visa programs.  The steps it will take include directing the department's wage and  hour division to  use all its tools  to conduct civil probes. The department is also asking its employment and training office to work on proposing changes to the labor condition application that companies file when they seek to hire foreign guest workers. In addition, the department will be more aggressive in making criminal referrals to its inspector general's office and create a new working group to better oversee and coordinate enforcement efforts. “Entities who engage in visa program fraud and abuse are breaking our laws and are harming American workers, negatively affecting Americans’ ability to provide for themselves and their families,  Acosta said in a statement.

Comey, who was investigating a possible collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia to sway the 2016 U.S. election, was fired in May.

The growing use of opioids has grabbed attention in recent years as deaths from such drugs, both illicit and prescription, in the United States have reached what many experts call epidemic levels. The European drug agency's latest available data on overdose deaths shows they rose from 7,950 in 2014 and 7,345 in 2013. Opioids, which also include morphine and heroin, were related to 81 percent of all the deaths. Deaths from overdoses had been on a downward trend from 2008 until 2012. The agency warned that drug-related deaths in Europe could be much higher due to  systematic under-reporting in some countries  and delays in reporting. Still, Europe's drug deaths remain far lower than in the United States, where 52,000 people died of overdoses in 2015, 33,000 of which were related to opioids. The agency said a big difference between the United States and Europe is the regulatory approach to prescribing opioid painkillers.  However, the possibility of under-reporting cannot be dismissed, as Europeans experiencing problems with prescription medicines may access different services than those used by illicit drug users,  the report said. It also said demand for opioids now represented 38 percent of all requests for drug treatment in the European Union, indicating rising opioid use.  In both Europe and North America, the recent emergence of highly potent new synthetic opioids, mostly fentanyl derivatives, is causing considerable concern,  the report said. Fentanyl is a synthetic pain medication, which is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine, and has been used increasingly as a recreational drug. The report found that the mean age of death from drug overdoses for men was 38 and 41 for women.  The United Kingdom has, by far, the largest number of overdose deaths in Europe, and reached 2,655 in 2015. In Germany, which was second, overdose deaths were 1,226.

Though the seat he is standing for has been held by left-leaning Labour for 20 years, Anthony felt change was in the air.  I'm very optimistic,  he said last month, adding that the response he was getting from voters was  completely different  from the election in 2015. Early polls suggested the centre-right Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Theresa May, could achieve an overall landslide, possibly even a majority as decisive as those held by Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first woman prime minister from 1979 to 1990.   But in the past few weeks the Conservatives' lead – about 20 percentage points when the election was announced – has fallen. May's campaign stumbled over a U-turn on social care policy, and she declined to take part in televised debates with her opponents. Meanwhile, the main opposition Labour party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, proposed increases in public spending that grabbed the attention of voters. On Saturday a van and knife attack that killed seven people in the heart of London shifted the focus to security. Corbyn criticized May's record as interior minister of cutting police numbers, and May said Corbyn was weak on terrorism. Recent surveys have shown the Conservatives ahead of Labour by between 1 and 12 percentage points. Different poll models give a wide range of projected results. Some predict May will increase her majority, but one projection suggests she could lose parliamentary seats. Pollsters warn that much still depends on the level of voter turnout. Anthony remains optimistic. A key reason: Last year, he, like the majority of Britons, backed the campaign to take Britain out of the European Union.   It's very, very difficult to find someone who didn't support leaving the EU,  said Anthony as a train on the city's landmark rollercoaster, the Big One, clattered around the tracks behind him.  His town is one of around 50 places where Labour's majority is small enough for Conservatives to target voters who wanted out of Europe. The Conservatives, long more euroskeptic than Labour, have the largest chunk of pro-Brexit support, studies have shown. In particular, the Conservatives have picked up votes from the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), which got nearly 13 percent of the vote in the 2015 election. UKIP now languishes at about 4 percent in the polls.  As the June 8 poll approaches, Brexit has partly receded as an important divider between the main parties. Last week Corbyn set out Labour's approach to the issue, making plain that he, like May, sees no going back on Brexit. There was  no doubt,  he said, that Britain would leave the EU. However, May has said she is willing for Britain to leave the EU without a deal if negotiations fail, while Corbyn has said he would not leave without an agreement. May's Stumble  It was in Blackpool in 1968 that a young Margaret Thatcher gave a speech to the Conservative Party conference on the theme  What's wrong with politics?  Her answer - too much government – came to influence Britain for decades. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May delivers a speech during an election campaign visit to Langton Rugby Club in Stoke-on-Trent, June 6, 2017.Ben Stansall/PoolBut May is no Thatcher. The launch of her party manifesto on May 18 was widely seen as nudging the Conservatives leftwards in a bid to seize the center ground. The manifesto adopted some of Labour's previous policy proposals, including a promised cap on energy prices and new rights and protection for workers in the gig economy. While Labour's campaign slogan is  For the many, not the few,  May has promised a country that works,  not for the privileged few, but for everyone.  She has proposed new rules on business, including measures to restrict top-level executive pay, guarantee worker representation on boards, and new limits on  aggressive asset-stripping or tax avoidance  in takeovers.  We do not believe in untrammeled free markets,  the Conservative manifesto says.  We reject the cult of selfish individualism.   But in a bid to balance the nation's finances as well as be more inclusive, the Conservatives also floated one policy that caught voters' attention. The party proposed that more of the costs of caring for the sick elderly should come from the sale of their homes. The new plan was quickly dubbed a  dementia tax  in the media.  There was a furor and May backtracked. While May had campaigned on a slogan of  strong and stable government,  the spotlight turned onto her willingness to make U-turns. The party's  strong and stable  mantra was widely mocked on social media. At a press conference, May said  nothing has changed.  A spokesman said:  Categorically, we haven't done a U-turn.  But the Conservatives' lead in the polls began to erode.   Slideshow (18 Images)Radical Outsider  Under Corbyn, Labour has moved away from the center ground once occupied by Tony Blair, who won three elections for the party between 1997 to 2005. A veteran from the trade union movement, Corbyn has a track record of radical activism, often voting against the government when Labour was in power, and he still presents himself as an outsider.  His manifesto promises include nationalization of energy and water supplies, investing 250 billion pounds ($320 billion) over 10 years in infrastructure, more staff for the National Health Service, police and fire services, an end to tuition fees for students, more free childcare, extra holidays, and higher taxes on business and the top 5 percent of earners.  He has courted young people and won hundreds of thousands of followers on social media. Labour traditionally polls well among young people and about a million new voters aged 18 to 24 have registered to vote since the election was announced.  Turnout may prove crucial. Past experience indicates that the young are far less likely to vote than the elderly, who favor the Conservatives.  Corbyn, 68, began the campaign lowly rated as a leader and potential prime minister by many voters - and even by some of his own party candidates. On May 22 the Labour contender in Sedgefield, the constituency which sent Blair to parliament, wrote a note to his constituents, saying:  I am no supporter of Theresa May and I am no supporter of Jeremy Corbyn – the only people I support are you.  But recently Corbyn's ratings have improved. In a survey late last month by YouGov, a pollster, 35 percent of respondents rated Corbyn favorably, up from only 22 percent a month previously.  An adviser in Corbyn's campaign said his improved ratings reflected how broadcasters must give balanced coverage of campaigning and that  many voters are seeing the real Jeremy and Labour's policies unfiltered for the first time, and many are liking what they see.

The Saudi government's move follows coordinated action on Monday by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to cut links with Qatar, accusing the country of supporting terrorism. Saudi Arabia's General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) also said in a statement any licenses granted to Qatar Airways employees would also be withdrawn. Analysts said the fallout from canceled flights resulting from Saudi Arabia's action would cost Qatar Airways millions of dollars in lost revenue.  The revoking of the license suggests that this spat will be a long and drawn out. You don't revoke licenses if you expect a resolution quickly,  Saj Ahmad, the U.K.-based chief analyst at StrategicAero Research, said.  The real challenge is what Qatar can do to mitigate [the losses], and right now, it doesn't look like it is in a position to do anything.  Saudi Arabia's aviation authority said customers seeking adjustments on tickets to or from Qatar should communicate with the company by phone or through its website. Dozens of people crowded into the Qatar Airways office in central Riyadh on Tuesday morning, asking for refunds or to be re-booked on flights with other airlines.  We’re trying to get refunds, but the problem is the logistics. Now if you want to re-book, how are you supposed to deal with the hotel booking, the rental car, the visa?  Ganas al-Ganas, a Saudi national planning a trip to Europe, said. The suspension of flights comes three weeks before the start of the Eid holiday week, a popular time for travel in the Gulf. Qatar Airways said on its website it had arranged three chartered Oman Air flights to transport passengers from Jeddah to Muscat on Tuesday. A connecting Qatar Airways flight would then take them onwards to Doha. The airline also canceled flights to Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, the day after it had suspended flights to Saudi Arabia.

At 10:34 a.m. ET (1434 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index was up 1.97 points, or 0.01 percent, at 15,411.75. Of the index's 10 main groups, four were in positive territory. The materials group, which includes precious metal miners, jumped 2.1 percent. Gold companies dominated the top of the index on the positive side, with Barrick Gold climbing 3.9 percent to C$22.64, and Kinross Gold rallying 5.1 percent to C$6.01. Gold touched its highest level in seven weeks after the U.S. dollar fell to a seven-month low. The currency came under pressure after weak U.S. economic data trimmed expectations of a rapid rise in U.S. interest rates. Gold futures rose 1.1 percent to $1,292.80 an ounce. Iamgold Corp soared 8.7 percent to C$6.60 after Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining Co said it agreed to take an interest in a gold mining project from the company for $195 million. Advances were capped by a 0.4 percent retreat in financial services companies. The group includes Canada's biggest banks and insurers and accounts for about a third of the index's weight. Manulife Financial Corp declined 1.3 percent to C$23.20, while Royal Bank of Canada dipped 0.5 percent to C$93.02. The energy group remained unchanged. Investor sentiment was cautious ahead of a busy Thursday, with Britain heading to voting booths and former FBI director James Comey testifying before Congress. The European Central Bank is also meeting on Thursday. Wariness over the impact of an Arab rift over Qatar added to the uncertainty, particularly in the oil market.

Westcon-Comstor, a distributor of technology and services for network security and data centres mostly in the United States, has been a drag on Datatec's performance in recent months due partly to a troubled software roll-out in Europe, Asia and Africa. The business accounts for more than a third of Datatec sales and profit.

U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors piled into low-risk bonds on worries linked to Britain's general election, the European Central Bank's policy meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before a Senate panel, all scheduled for Thursday. The dollar was down 0.91 percent against the yen at 109.45, having broken below its 200-day moving average to touch 109.29 yen, its lowest since April 21.  It's safe-haven (demand) as well as the technical break that's driving dollar-yen,  said Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies in New York.  It's basically following yields in the U.S., which are grinding lower as the market gets a little bit nervous ahead of Thursday.  With the Bank of Japan keeping 10-year Japanese bond yields pinned to zero, the dollar-yen exchange rate has been closely correlated for the past year with any shifts in U.S. 10-year Treasuries. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was down 0.18 percent at 96.624. Comey, fired by President Donald Trump in May, will be grilled by the Senate Intelligence Committee on whether Trump tried to get him to back off an investigation of alleged ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia. The threats to Trump and some of his senior advisers from the affair have added to market doubts over the administration's ability to deliver a promised boost to growth and weighed on the dollar. The euro was up 0.16 percent against the dollar to $1.127. The common currency has gained in recent weeks on various factors, including an ebb in French political concerns and upbeat euro zone data. However, complacency that the ECB will be less dovish has left the euro vulnerable to disappointment if the central bank does not satisfy those expectations, analysts said. Sterling was down 0.09 percent against the dollar to $1.2889. With two days to go until Britain holds a national election, opinion polls have shown that Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labor party has ebbed over the last three weeks, with some putting her majority in doubt.  This has put sterling under pressure as investors are looking to cover their risk,  said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst for Think Markets in London.

Federal prosecutors said in an emailed statement that one of the men arrested was Henrique Eduardo Alves, a former tourism minister. Former lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha, who is already in prison, also fell under the scope of investigation. Both Alves and Cunha were also targeted because of developments in a fraud investigation at the Caixa Economica Federal [CEF.UL], prosecutors said. The bank is Brazil's largest mortgage lender. There was no immediate response to calls for comment from   representatives for Alves and Cunha. Last June, Alves resigned as President Michel Temer's tourism minister after accusations that he had taken bribes.

The Arena das Dunas stadium in the city of Natal is the seventh of 11 stadiums used in the 2014 World Cup to come under scrutiny.  According to the police statement, contracts for the construction of the stadium were inflated by a total of 77 million reais ($23.4 million) to fund bribes to lawmakers. The case could heighten pressure on Temer, who faces calls for his ouster after he was caught on tape allegedly condoning bribes to silence a key potential witness in the country's sweeping three-year-old corruption investigation, known as Operation Car Wash. Late on Monday, police sent Temer a list of 84 questions related to the allegations. He has 24 hours to answer.  His administration is being threatened by an electoral court trial starting on Tuesday over the alleged use of illicit money to fund former President Dilma Rousseff's 2014 election campaign.

The growing use of opioids has grabbed attention in recent years as deaths from such drugs, both illicit and prescription, in the United States have reached what many experts call epidemic levels. The European drug agency's latest available data on overdose deaths shows they rose from 7,950 in 2014 and 7,345 in 2013. Opioids, which also include morphine and heroin, were related to 81 percent of all the deaths. Deaths from overdoses had been on a downward trend from 2008 until 2012. The agency warned that drug-related deaths in Europe could be much higher due to  systematic under-reporting in some countries  and delays in reporting. Still, Europe's drug deaths remain far lower than in the United States, where 52,000 people died of overdoses in 2015, 33,000 of which were related to opioids. The agency said a big difference between the United States and Europe is the regulatory approach to prescribing opioid painkillers.  However, the possibility of under-reporting cannot be dismissed, as Europeans experiencing problems with prescription medicines may access different services than those used by illicit drug users,  the report said. It also said demand for opioids now represented 38 percent of all requests for drug treatment in the European Union, indicating rising opioid use.  In both Europe and North America, the recent emergence of highly potent new synthetic opioids, mostly fentanyl derivatives, is causing considerable concern,  the report said. Fentanyl is a synthetic pain medication, which is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine, and has been used increasingly as a recreational drug. The report found that the mean age of death from drug overdoses for men was 38 and 41 for women.  The United Kingdom has, by far, the largest number of overdose deaths in Europe, and reached 2,655 in 2015. In Germany, which was second, overdose deaths were 1,226.

Hundreds of people have been killed and over a million displaced in central Congo since fighting broke out last August between a local militia and government forces, the United Nations has said. U.N. investigators have found at least 42 mass graves in the zone and repeatedly accused government troops of using excessive force. The government says the militia is responsible for the graves and denies any systematic rights abuses.  The already dire situation in the Kasai provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to deteriorate, spreading to other provinces and across the border with Angola,  rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein told the U.N. Human Rights Council.   Unless I receive appropriate responses from the government regarding a joint investigation by 8 June, I will insist on the creation of an international investigative mechanism for the Kasais.  Congo's government opposes an international inquiry, saying that it is capable of investigating any crimes itself and has already charged several of its soldiers in connection with an apparent massacre of militia members. Zeid's declaration comes a day after the United States called on the United Nations to open an independent investigation into the killings of two U.N. investigators, an American and a Swede, in March. Congolese authorities opened a trial on Monday in the capital of Kasai-Central province, Kananga, against two men accused of belonging to the Kamuina Nsapu militia and participating in the killings, their lawyer, Tresor Kabangu, told Reuters. The prosecutor charged Evariste Ilunga Lumu, a 17-year-old student, and Daniel Mbayi Kabasele, a 30-year-old palm nut farmer, of the war crimes of murder and mutilation as well as participation in an insurrectional movement, Kabangu said.  U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric cast doubt last month on the credibility of the Congolese investigation, saying the world body was  taken aback at the rapidity at which it was done . Rights groups say they suspect Congolese forces may have been involved in the killings, which the authorities strenuously deny.

The Justice Department on Monday charged Reality Leigh Winner, 25, with removing classified material from a government facility in Georgia. It said she was arrested on Saturday. It was one of the first concrete efforts by the administration of President Donald Trump to crack down on leaks to the media. The charges were announced less than an hour after The Intercept published a top-secret document from the NSA that described Russian efforts to launch cyber attacks on at least one U.S. voting software supplier and send  spear-phishing  emails, or targeted emails, that try to trick a recipient into clicking on a malicious link to steal data, to more than 100 local election officials days before the Nov. 8 U.S. election. While the charges do not name the publication, a U.S. official with knowledge of the case said Winner was charged with leaking the NSA report to The Intercept. A second official confirmed The Intercept document was authentic and did not dispute that the charges were directly tied to it. The Justice Department declined to comment on the case beyond its filing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Winner's mother also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Intercept report carried details it said supported the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian intelligence services were seeking to infiltrate state voter registration systems as part of a broader effort to interfere in the election, discredit Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and help the Republican Trump win the election. The new material does not suggest that actual votes were manipulated. Reality Leigh Winner, 25, a federal contractor charged by the U.S. Department of Justice for sending classified material to a news organization, poses in a picture posted to her Instagram account.   Reality Winner/Social Media via REUTERSThe Intercept co-founding editor Glenn Greenwald did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While partially redacted, the NSA document is marked to show it would be up for declassification on May 5, 2042. The indictment against Winner alleges she  printed and improperly removed  classified intelligence reporting that was dated  on or about May 5, 2017.  Classified documents are typically due to be declassified after 25 years under an executive order signed under former President Bill Clinton. Slideshow (6 Images)The NSA opened a facility in Augusta in 2012 at Fort Gordon, a U.S. Army outpost. The FBI and several congressional committees are investigating how Russia interfered in the election and whether associates of President Donald Trump may have colluded with Russian intelligence operatives during the campaign. Trump has dismissed the allegations as  fake news  and sought to focus attention on leaks of information to the media. Winner graduated from basic military training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio in 2011. Investigators determined she was one of only six individuals to print the document in question and that she had exchanged emails with the news outlet, according to the criminal complaint. The complaint said that on Saturday, Winner told an FBI agent she had intentionally printed classified intelligence and mailed it to a news organization while knowing  the contents of the reporting could be used to the injury of the United States and to the advantage of a foreign nation.  U.S. intelligence agencies including the NSA and Central Intelligence Agency have fallen victim to several thefts of classified material in recent years, often at the hands of a federal contractor. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 disclosed secret documents to journalists, including Greenwald, that revealed broad U.S. surveillance programs.

Investors were also drawn to gold, seen as a safe place to park assets, by uncertainty around Thursday's European Central Bank meeting, an election in Britain and testimony to a Senate committee by former FBI Director James Comey.                                            A weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of other currencies, while lower yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. Interest rate rises, however, push bond yields higher and tend to strengthen the dollar.      Spot gold        was up 1 percent at $1,292.34 an ounce at 1430 GMT, having earlier touched its highest since April 17 at$1,294.80.      U.S. gold futures         were 1 percent higher at $1,295 an ounce.       Light positioning and numerous upcoming geopolitical events should continue to underpin demand for the metal,  said MKS PAMP trader Sam Laughlin in a note.  Targets extend to the 2017 high around $1,295 and the psychological level of $1,300 above this.      Gold has risen more than 6 percent since a low of $1,213.81 in early May as political turmoil in the United States created doubts that President Donald Trump could enact economic stimulus, pushing down the dollar and bond yields.      The uptrend seems intact,  said Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler.  It's been helped by the dollar drifting lower and equity markets in the U.S. trading more or less flat.                  Weak U.S. economic data has left investors less certain of aggressive U.S. interest rate rises this year, Butler said, while bullion traders had already priced in a rate rise this month.                                European Central Bank policymakers will take a more benign view of the economy on Thursday and will even discuss dropping some of their pledges to ramp up stimulus if needed, sources told Reuters.                   Butler also said a decision by major gold consumer India to levy a sales tax on gold at 3 percent rather than the expected 5 percent was supporting bullion prices by spurring demand for physical metal.                  In other precious metals, silver        rose 0.9 percent to $17.67 an ounce, its highest level since April 25.      Palladium        climbed 1.9 percent to $857.30 an ounce, its highest since September 2014 while platinum        gained 1.5 percent to $965 an ounce after touching $967.50, the strongest since April 24.     Platinum and palladium, mainly used to make auto catalysts that clean exhaust fumes, have rallied despite data showing weaker global auto sales in May, Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said in a note.      We see technical rather than fundamental factors behind this (palladium) rally, supporting bullish sentiment in the futures market. We stick to our negative view and short position, expecting prices to realign with the weaker demand backdrop over the coming months.

The joint declaration, signed by energy ministers for the three countries and firms including Dong Energy and Siemens Gamesa, said the countries and companies would work together to deliver 60 gigawatts (GW), or at least 4 GW a year of offshore wind capacity in Europe in the 2020s.  With this Joint Statement, leading businesses and governments are taking the next step by committing to cooperate on the deployment of big volumes for offshore wind energy,  said Giles Dickson, chief executive officer of industry group WindEurope. Europe currently has around 13 GW of offshore wind capacity but expects the technology to grow as costs fall, and as countries look for ways to increase their low-carbon electricity options to help meet emission reduction targets. Recent bids for offshore wind in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, have seen costs fall by up to 48 percent in the last two years, and the technology is expected to be competitive with new conventional generation, such as gas power plants before 2030, the joint statement said. A report published by WindEurope on Tuesday said 25 percent of the EU's electricity demand could be met by offshore wind energy at an average cost of 54 euros/megawatt hour in the most favourable locations. The EU has a target to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent compared with 1990 levels by 2030.

Steve, the famed founder of AOL, and Jean, CEO of the Case Foundation and Chair of the National Geographic Society, have been transforming the twin worlds of technology and giving for decades. For the latest in Reuters'  Life Lessons  series, Jean Case spoke with Reuters on the 20th anniversary of her foundation's inception to discuss what life's thrill ride has taught her so far, and what challenges still lie ahead. Q: Just how extraordinarily normal were your beginnings?   A: It was so normal that I actually grew up in a place called Normal, Illinois. I was raised by a single mom, and was pretty close to my German immigrant grandparents, so they instilled a strong work ethic in me. I also had someone who took me under his wing, (former Florida Congressman) Clay Shaw, whose law office I worked in. So I like to think I had a series of guardian angels looking after me. Q: Your mom had the very tough job of waitress, so how did that environment shape your understanding of money? A: You have to take care of the basics first, if you can't count on financial security. So pay essentials like the electric bill before you think about buying anything else. She tried really hard, but as a waitress raising four kids, the bottom line is that it was never enough. She had to deny herself a whole lot just in order to pay the bills. Q: Eventually you achieved success by joining AOL, where you met your husband Steve. Was it strange to go from a world of need to a world of wealth? A: I went from being a recipient of philanthropy to being able to practice philanthropy. There are definitely big pendulum swings in life. But I have stayed close to the communities where I grew up, where people still struggle, and those folks have never allowed me to get enclosed in a bubble. Q: What role models have guided you along the way? A: I am a student of history, so many of them come from the past. Madam C.J. Walker, for instance, was one of the first self-made millionaires in the U.S. as a black female from the South. You look at someone like that, and you say 'Wow, if she can do that, then I can do anything.' Q: When you and Steve formed your foundation, how did you hash out how to allocate resources? A: We started 20 years ago, and a common theme in a lot of what we have done is to take initiatives and really scale them in a powerful way, by partnering with government and the private sector. For instance, along with the Obama administration, we helped lead Startup America, helping and championing startups across the country after the financial crisis. Q: You two have signed on to the Giving Pledge to donate at least half your wealth to charity. Was that decision easy or difficult? A: It was easy in the sense that we had already made the commitment personally, but the hard part was doing something so public and visible. We had to get comfortable with that. Our kids were very young when we signed on, and they are all in their 20s now, and so they have always known that we wanted to give away most of our wealth. Q: What money mistakes in your career stick out in your mind? A: A litany of them. One was pretty visible, though: We had a clean-water initiative that we put millions of dollars into, before we realized that the ship just couldn't be righted. I even wrote something about it, and called it 'The Painful Acknowledgement of Coming Up Short.'  Q: Will your children take over the reins of the foundation someday? A: They are not involved and it was never our intent to get them involved. Think of the really wonderful moments in life: Earning your own paycheck, buying your first car. We wanted all five of them to have those experiences on their own, so they have all started on their personal life tracks. In fact, the last two graduated from college just last week.

The Saudi government's move follows coordinated action on Monday by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to cut ties with Qatar, accusing the country of supporting terrorism. Doha dismisses the charge. Saudi Arabia's General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) said in a statement any licences granted to Qatar Airways employees would also be withdrawn. A few hours later Bahrain announced it had cancelled licences granted to Qatar Airways and had also asked the airline to close its offices within 48 hours, the official Bahrain News Agency reported. Analysts said the fallout from cancelled flights resulting from Saudi Arabia's action would cost Qatar Airways millions of dollars in lost revenue.  The revoking of the licence suggests that this spat will be a long and drawn out. You don't revoke licences if you expect a resolution quickly,  Saj Ahmad, the Britain-based chief analyst at StrategicAero Research, said.  The real challenge is what Qatar can do to mitigate (the losses), and right now, it doesn't look like it is in a position to do anything.  Saudi Arabia's aviation authority said customers seeking adjustments on tickets to or from Qatar should communicate with the company by phone or through its website. Dozens of people crowded into the Qatar Airways office in central Riyadh on Tuesday morning, asking for refunds or to be re-booked on flights with other airlines.  We’re trying to get refunds, but the problem is the logistics. Now if you want to re-book, how are you supposed to deal with the hotel booking, the rental car, the visa?  Ganas al-Ganas, a Saudi national planning a trip to Europe, said. The suspension of flights comes three weeks before the start of the Eid holiday week, a popular time for travel in the Gulf. Qatar Airways said on its website it had arranged three chartered Oman Air flights to transport passengers from Jeddah to Muscat on Tuesday. A connecting Qatar Airways flight would then take them onwards to Doha. The airline also cancelled flights to Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, the day after it had suspended flights to Saudi Arabia.

The news raises questions about the police's judgment and increases pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, who three days before a national election is facing criticism for overseeing cuts to police during her years as interior minister. In Britain's third Islamist attack in as many months, three men on Saturday rammed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before running into the Borough Market area, where they slit throats and stabbed people indiscriminately. Seven people were killed and dozens wounded. All three attackers were shot dead by police, who made at least a dozen arrests in east London on Sunday and carried out further raids on Monday. Police on Monday named two of the attackers and said they were trying to identify the third. One, 27-year-old Khuram Shazad Butt, was a British citizen born in Pakistan who had already been investigated by police and Britain's domestic spy agency MI5.  However, there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned, and the investigation had been prioritized accordingly,  police said. Another attacker, 30-year-old Rachid Redouane, went by the alias Rachid Elkhdar and claimed to be Moroccan or Libyan, police said. He and Butt lived in the same area of east London. One of Butt's neighbors, Ikenna Chigbo, told Reuters he had chatted with Butt - also known as  Abz  - just hours before the attack on Saturday and said he appeared  almost euphoric .   He was very sociable, seemed like an ordinary family man. He would always bring his kid out into the lobby . Another neighbor, Michael Mimbo, told Reuters that Butt supported the north London football team Arsenal. One of the dead attackers has been pictured wearing an Arsenal shirt. Related CoverageUK opinion polls: countdown to Thursday's electionUK PM May's Conservatives see poll lead narrow to 1 point: SurvationMimbo said Butt had grown a longer beard and worn traditional Islamic dress more often over the two years he had known him, but showed no sign of radicalization.  As an individual he was a cool, calm guy. One of my friends would let Abz babysit his daughter,  Mimbo said. Police said on Monday they had released all 12 people arrested in the neighborhood on Sunday without charge. However, police were investigating what appeared to be Molotov cocktails in the back of the van, Sky News reported. Police Cuts The rampage followed a suicide bomb attack which killed 22 adults and children at a concert in Manchester two weeks ago, and an attack in March when five people died after a van was driven into pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge. Two of the men shot dead by police following the attack on London Bridge and Borough Market on Saturday are seen in this undated combination image of two photographs, received in London via the Metropolitan Police in London on June 5, 2017.  On left is Khuram Shazad Butt and on right is Rachid Redouane. Metropolitan Police/Handout via REUTERSMay described the latest incident as  an attack on the free world . But with Britons due to vote in a national election on Thursday, her decision to reduce the number of police officers in England and Wales by almost 20,000 during her six years as interior minister from 2010 to 2016 shot to the top of the political agenda. May did not answer repeated questions from reporters on her cuts, but said counter-terrorism budgets had been protected and police had the powers they needed. Police said they had to prioritize resources on suspects who were believed to be preparing an attack or providing active support for one. Butt did not fall into this category when they last investigated him.  It's just a fact that, over the last seven years, we as a city have lost 600 million pounds from our budgets. We have had to close police stations, sell police buildings, and we've lost thousands of police staff,  said London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a member of the opposition Labour Party. Slideshow (11 Images)May's main opponent, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, backed calls for her resignation over the police cuts. He said many people were  very worried that she was at the Home Office for all this time, presided over these cuts in police numbers, and now is saying that we have a problem . May hit back by criticizing Corbyn, a pacifist who has opposed some security legislation in parliament and expressed reservations in the past about police responding to armed attackers with  shoot-to-kill  tactics. Corbyn's critics have often accused him of weakness on terrorism, citing his sympathy for members of the Palestinian group Hamas, Lebanon's Hezbollah and Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army. The IRA ran a 30-year armed campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland. The Conservative Party's lead over Labour has narrowed markedly from 20 points or more when May called the election in April to a range between one and 12 points now, although the Conservatives are still widely expected to win a majority. 'Tell Them Chrissy Sent You' Christine Archibald, a 30-year-old Canadian who had worked in a shelter for the homeless before moving to Europe to be with her fiancé, was the first of those who died to be named. Thousands attended a vigil on Monday evening to honor the victims outside London's City Hall, close to London Bridge. Before holding a minute's silence, Khan, the first Muslim to be elected mayor of a major Western European city, said:  I want to send a clear message to the sick and evil extremists who commit these hideous crimes. We will defeat you. You will not win.  The Islamic State militant group, which is losing territory in Syria and Iraq to an offensive backed by a U.S.-led coalition, has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Banking sources said some banks from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain delayed letters of credit and other deals with Qatari banks after their governments cut diplomatic ties and transport links with Doha on Monday, accusing Qatar of backing terrorism. Saudi Arabia's central bank advised banks in the kingdom not to trade with Qatari banks in Qatari riyals, the sources told Reuters. The central bank did not respond to a request for comment. One banker in Riyadh said that he had received a directive from the central bank that essentially banned further transactions with any Qatari institution, but that the document was ambiguous in some areas, such as how to handle existing syndicated loans, so he would seek clarification.  Qatar has dismissed the terrorism charge and welcomed a Kuwaiti mediation effort. Doha, the world's biggest liquefied natural gas exporter, says it has enough reserves to support its banks and its riyal currency, which is pegged to the dollar. Qatari banks have been borrowing abroad to fund their activities. Their foreign liabilities ballooned to 451 billion riyals ($124 billion) in March from 310 billion riyals at the end of 2015, central bank data shows.  So any extended disruption to their ties with foreign banks could potentially threaten a funding crunch for some Qatari banks. Banks from the UAE, Europe and elsewhere have been lending to Qatari institutions. Bankers in the UAE and Bahrain said they were postponing deals until they received guidance from their central banks on how to handle Qatar. The UAE central bank is preparing such guidance and may announce it within a day, the sources said.  We will not take action without central bank guidance, but it is wise to evaluate what you give to Qatari clients and hold off until there is further clarity,  said a UAE banker, adding that trade finance had stalled for the time being. The sources said the Saudi, UAE and Bahraini central banks had all asked banks under their supervision to report their exposure to Qatari banks. Reserves With an estimated $335 billion of assets in its sovereign wealth fund and its gas exports earning billions of dollars every month, Qatar has enough financial power to protect its banks.  We are watching the financial sector very closely. If the market needs liquidity, the central bank will definitely provide liquidity,  a Qatari central bank official told Reuters. Nevertheless, losing some of their foreign business links could be uncomfortable for Qatari banks because they have been expanding their loans faster than other banks in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. To fund this, they have been seeking loans and deposits from the rest of the GCC. Among large banks, Doha Bank (DOBK.QA) and Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB) (QISB.QA) are the most exposed to GCC deposits, with QIB obtaining a quarter of its deposits from the GCC, said Olivier Panis, analyst at Moody's Investors Service.   We need to look into the maturity of those deposits but if they're short-term deposits, this could expose the banks rapidly to reduced confidence from GCC institutions,  he said. Doha Bank and QIB did not respond to requests for comment. Because of such worries, the Qatari riyal fell in the spot market QAR= on Tuesday to 3.6470 against the U.S. dollar, its lowest level since June 2016, although it later rebounded to 3.6405, almost equal to its official peg of 3.64.  It also fell slightly in the one-year forwards market QAR1Y=, where traders bet on rates 12 months from now. The riyal's drop  is based on speculation , the Qatari central bank official said, adding Doha had a  huge cushion  of foreign currency to support the riyal if necessary. A commercial banker in fellow GCC state Kuwait, which did not sever diplomatic ties with Qatar, said on Tuesday that business with Qatari institutions was continuing as normal. But there were signs that Qatar's financial ties might be damaged well beyond the Gulf. Some Sri Lankan banks stopped buying Qatari riyals, saying counterpart banks in Singapore had advised them not to accept the currency. In Egypt, which also cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, some banks resumed dealing in Qatari riyals after halting trade on Monday, but others appeared to be continuing to limit transactions with Doha. Banks reducing their business with Qatar could lose out financially, but the damage looks likely to be relatively minor. Panis at Moody's estimated under 2 percent of Saudi banking sector assets were related to Qatar and the figure was around 5 percent for Bahrain, while the UAE's exposure was also small.

Speaking in New Zealand after a trip to Australia, Tillerson reiterated the U.S. commitment to the Asia-Pacific region as global leaders have expressed growing mistrust over the Trump administration, which has withdrawn from key international agreements since taking office. At home, Trump's administration has been plagued by questions over links to the Russian government. Tillerson said Trump told him to try to improve ties with Russia regardless of the U.S. political backdrop.  I can't really comment on any of that because I don't have any direct knowledge,  Tillerson told a news conference in Wellington, when asked how worried he was that the U.S. political crisis could take down the Trump administration.  The president's been clear to me: do not let what's happened over here in the political realm prevent you from the work that you need to do on this relationship and he's been quite clear with me... that we might make progress. I'm really not involved in any of these other issues,  he said after a meeting with New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to tilt the election campaign in Trump's favor, including by hacking into the emails of senior Democrats, a charge the Kremlin denies.

A tightening race between the ruling Conservative Party over the opposition Labor Party, based on recent polls, raised uncertainty about Britain's path in its divorce from the European Union.     Traders have speculated whether ECB policymakers might signal a possible end to the central bank's bond purchase program at its upcoming meeting in light of evidence of an improving European economy.      Comey's first public appearance since he was fired by U.S. President Donald Trump might shed more light on a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into alleged Russian meddling in last year's U.S. presidential election.      We have risk events piling up,  said Blake Gwinn, U.S. rates strategist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.  We'll be very focused on what happens on Thursday, but it might end up being a dud.      Safe-haven bids pushed benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields to 2.129 percent, the lowest since Nov. 10, which was two days after Trump's surprise election victory.      At 10:02 a.m. (1502 GMT), the 10-year yield was 2.145 percent, down nearly 4 basis points from late on Monday, Reuters data showed.     A Bloomberg report that said China was ready to purchase more U.S. government debt as the yuan has stabilized brought a wave of Treasuries buying earlier on Tuesday, analysts said.       It's just one more factor in a risk-off day,  Gwinn said.

Omran Daqneesh and his father appeared in a video clip, apparently still living in Aleppo telling the reporter, Kinana Allouche, he didn't want to leave Syria. A photograph of the wounded boy, sitting blankly and alone in the back of an ambulance after an airstrike, was circulated worldwide last August, highlighting the suffering of civilians in besieged east Aleppo. His older brother, Ali, died from his wounds after the attack. Daqneesh's father told the reporter his son was in good health in Aleppo - now under the control of President Bashar al-Assad's forces. He said he had cut his son's hair and changed his name to protect him from being kidnapped and accused rebels of intimidating the family. It was not clear whether the family had been coerced into taking part in the short video posted on Facebook, the first time the boy had been seen publicly since he was wounded. However, Valerie Szybala from the Syria Institute, an independent research organisation focused on Syria, said the family was unlikely to have been speaking freely.  They are under government control now and this is a government that we know arrests and tortures anyone that speaks out against it ... to me the situation seems to suggest this is probably coerced,  Szybala told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Rebel resistance in Aleppo ended last December after years of fighting and months of bitter siege and bombardment that culminated in a bloody retreat, as insurgents agreed to withdraw in a ceasefire.  Syria's civil war, which erupted in 2011 has killed an estimated 465,000 people.

Bosnian Serb leaders have always denied the 1995 massacre of more than 8,000 Muslim Bosniaks in Srebrenica was genocide although two international war crimes courts have stated the atrocity constituted genocide.  In the siege of Sarajevo, hundreds of thousands of people were bombed and shot at from surrounding hills and kept without food, water and electricity for nearly four years. More than 11,000 people died, including 1,100 children.   It's impossible to use here the textbooks ... which say the Serbs have committed genocide and kept Sarajevo under siege,  the Serb Republic's nationalist President Milorad Dodik was quoted as saying by local media.   This is not correct and this will not be taught here.   More than 20 years since the war between Bosnian Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats, the Balkan country remains divided along ethnic lines, and students learn different versions of history. Under an internationally sponsored 2002 agreement between Bosnia's two regions, the Serb Republic and the Bosniak-Croat Federation, the 1992-95 war was omitted from history textbooks because each party had its own interpretation of the events.  But the lectures about the Sarajevo siege and the Srebrenica genocide have been included in some history textbooks in the Bosniak-Croat Federation, and could be used by Bosniak students in some of 22 schools they attend in the Serb Republic. Serb Republic Education Minister Dane Milosevic said this weekend that he would ban the use of such textbooks.   Tens of thousands of Bosniaks, who were driven from their homes, have returned after the war to what is now the Serb-dominated region. Many complain their children are discriminated against and not allowed to learn their language and history. In Bosnia, where more than 100,000 people were killed in the conflict and two million internally displaced, minority ethnic groups also face widespread discrimination.

Fighters linked to Islamic State have been cornered in a built-up sliver of the southern lakeside town after two weeks of intense combat. The military said that over the past 24 hours it had taken several buildings that had been defended by snipers. In one house they found a vault loaded with neat stacks of money worth 52.2 million pesos ($1.06 million) and cheques made out for cash worth 27 million pesos ($550,000).  The recovery of those millions of cash indicates that they are running because the government troops are pressing in and focusing on destroying them,  Marines Operations Officer Rowan Rimas told a news conference in the town as helicopters on machinegun runs buzzed overhead. Black smoke poured from an area near one of the town's  mosques and the lake after bombings by OV-10 attack aircraft and artillery fire from the ground. The battle for Marawi has raised concerns that the ultra-radical Islamic State, on a back foot in Syria and Iraq, is building a regional base on the Philippine island of Mindanao. Officials said that, among the several hundred militants who seized the town on May 23, there were about 40 foreigners from neighboring Indonesia and Malaysia but also from India, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Chechnya. Related CoverageFather of Philippines' militant Maute brothers arrested: policeThe fighters prepared for a long siege, stockpiling arms and food in tunnels, basements, mosques and madrasas, or Islamic religious schools, military officials say. The Philippines is largely Christian, but Marawi City is overwhelmingly Muslim. Progress in the military campaign has been slow because hundreds of civilians are still trapped or being held hostage in the urban heart of the town, officials have said.  In a few days, we will we will be able to get everything, we will be able to clear the entire Marawi City,  armed forces Chief of Staff General Eduaro Año said in a radio interview. 'Maybe They Watch War Movies' A government soldier carries a box containing 52.2 million pesos ($1.06 million) cash seized from a vault in a house previously controlled by militants in the Marawi city, Philippines June 6, 2017.Neil Jerome MoralesFighting erupted in Marawi after a bungled raid aimed at capturing Isnilon Hapilon, whom Islamic State proclaimed as its  emir  of Southeast Asia last year after he pledged allegiance to the group. The U.S. State Department has offered a bounty of up to $5 million for his arrest. On Monday, President Rodrigo Duterte offered a bounty of 10 million pesos ($200,000) to anyone who  neutralized  Hapilon, and 5 million pesos for each of the two brothers who founded the Maute group, one of four factions that banded together to take the town. Police on Tuesday arrested a man who identified himself as  the father of the Maute brothers. He was in a vehicle along with other members of his family that was stopped at a checkpoint in Davao City, 260 km (160 miles) to the southeast.  As a patriarch and the father of the Maute brothers ... I guess he can still persuade his sons to stop the fighting in Marawi and once and for all surrender to the government,  regional military spokesman Brigadier General Gilbert Gapay told the news conference. Armed forces chief Año said about 100 Maute militants were holding out in Marawi, and the military was checking a report that one of the brothers, Omarkhayam, had been killed in an air strike. Duterte, who launched a ruthless campaign against drugs after coming to power a year ago, has said the Marawi fighters were financed by drug lords in Mindanao, an island the size of South Korea that has suffered for decades from banditry and insurgencies. Jo-Ar Herrera, a military spokesman, said the discovery of the banknotes and cheques was evidence the militants had links to international terrorist groups. However, he said an investigation was needed to establish the facts. It is possible that the money came from a bank that was raided on the first day of the siege. Herrera told Reuters last week that a branch of Landbank had been attacked and he had heard that one of its vaults was opened. A four-hour ceasefire to evacuate residents trapped in the town was interrupted by gunfire on Sunday, leaving some 500-600 inside with dwindling supplies of food and water.  Officials say that 1,469 civilians have been rescued. The latest numbers for militants killed in the battle is 120, along with 39 security personnel. The authorities have put the civilian death toll at between 20 and 38. Asked to describe the fighting skills and training of the militants in the town, Major Rimas said:  They have snipers and their positions are well defended. Maybe they watch war movies a lot, or action pictures a lot so they borrowed some tactics from it.

Qatar's index fell 1.6 percent to 9,059 points, its lowest close since January 2016, in heavy trade. It had plunged 7.3 percent on Monday after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, accusing it of backing terrorism. The Qatari market rebounded more than 3 percent in early trade on Tuesday, buoyed by hopes that a Kuwaiti mediation effort might succeed. Some fund managers also said they expected Qatari state-linked funds to support the market. But the rebound was short-lived. In contrast to Monday, when selling of stocks was indiscriminate, many of the biggest losers on Tuesday were related to Qatar's foreign trade, which could decline or face higher costs due to the sanctions. Logistics company Gulf Warehousing sank 8.0 percent and Qatari German Medical Devices, which has done considerable business in Saudi Arabia, tumbled 8.8 percent. The biggest lender, Qatar National Bank, slipped 1.3 percent. Although Qatar's huge financial reserves mean it can probably avoid a crippling crisis, many parts of its economy, from tourism to banks which obtain funding from elsewhere in the Gulf, may be hit. Most other Gulf bourses dropped moderately. Although Gulf economies have little exposure to Qatar, foreign portfolio investors may at least temporarily become more cautious towards the whole region; the Saudi riyal edged down in the one-year forwards market on Tuesday and regional bonds slipped. The Saudi Arabian, UAE and Bahraini central banks have not yet clarified how they want commercial banks in their countries to handle business ties with Qatar, which involve substantial cross-border lending, deposits and syndicated loans. If the commercial banks are advised to get rid of their Qatari assets in a short timeframe, or if authorities act against Qatari banking assets in their jurisdictions, that could provoke retaliation by Doha and turmoil in the Gulf banking and money markets. The Saudi stock index, which has been buoyed in recent days by expectations that international index compiler MSCI will start on June 20 a process towards upgrading Riyadh to emerging market status, fell 0.5 percent in active trade on Tuesday. Petrochemical stocks were particularly hard hit after oil prices dropped on concern that the Qatar crisis could disrupt an agreement among global oil producers to prop up prices. Saudi Basic Industries lost 1.4 percent. Dubai's index edged up 0.2 percent as builder Drake & Scull, which has been rebounding from year-lows for the past week, added 1.1 percent to 0.38 dirham in its heaviest trade for almost four months. But it came well off the day's high of 0.409 dirham. In Egypt, the index rose 0.8 percent on the back of strong blue-chip property developers, although in the broad market, gainers roughly equalled losers. Remco Tourism Villages jumped 9.9 percent after saying it intended to finish marketing all units of its Stella Heights project before year-end for about 2.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($139 million).

Steve, the famed founder of AOL, and Jean, CEO of the Case Foundation and Chair of the National Geographic Society, have been transforming the twin worlds of technology and giving for decades. For the latest in Reuters'  Life Lessons  series, Jean Case spoke with Reuters on the 20th anniversary of her foundation's inception to discuss what life's thrill ride has taught her so far, and what challenges still lie ahead. Q: Just how extraordinarily normal were your beginnings?   A: It was so normal that I actually grew up in a place called Normal, Illinois. I was raised by a single mom, and was pretty close to my German immigrant grandparents, so they instilled a strong work ethic in me. I also had someone who took me under his wing, (former Florida Congressman) Clay Shaw, whose law office I worked in. So I like to think I had a series of guardian angels looking after me. Q: Your mom had the very tough job of waitress, so how did that environment shape your understanding of money? A: You have to take care of the basics first, if you can't count on financial security. So pay essentials like the electric bill before you think about buying anything else. She tried really hard, but as a waitress raising four kids, the bottom line is that it was never enough. She had to deny herself a whole lot just in order to pay the bills. Q: Eventually you achieved success by joining AOL, where you met your husband Steve. Was it strange to go from a world of need to a world of wealth? A: I went from being a recipient of philanthropy to being able to practice philanthropy. There are definitely big pendulum swings in life. But I have stayed close to the communities where I grew up, where people still struggle, and those folks have never allowed me to get enclosed in a bubble. Q: What role models have guided you along the way? A: I am a student of history, so many of them come from the past. Madam C.J. Walker, for instance, was one of the first self-made millionaires in the U.S. as a black female from the South. You look at someone like that, and you say 'Wow, if she can do that, then I can do anything.' Q: When you and Steve formed your foundation, how did you hash out how to allocate resources? A: We started 20 years ago, and a common theme in a lot of what we have done is to take initiatives and really scale them in a powerful way, by partnering with government and the private sector. For instance, along with the Obama administration, we helped lead Startup America, helping and championing startups across the country after the financial crisis. Q: You two have signed on to the Giving Pledge to donate at least half your wealth to charity. Was that decision easy or difficult? A: It was easy in the sense that we had already made the commitment personally, but the hard part was doing something so public and visible. We had to get comfortable with that. Our kids were very young when we signed on, and they are all in their 20s now, and so they have always known that we wanted to give away most of our wealth. Q: What money mistakes in your career stick out in your mind? A: A litany of them. One was pretty visible, though: We had a clean-water initiative that we put millions of dollars into, before we realized that the ship just couldn't be righted. I even wrote something about it, and called it 'The Painful Acknowledgement of Coming Up Short.'  Q: Will your children take over the reins of the foundation someday? A: They are not involved and it was never our intent to get them involved. Think of the really wonderful moments in life: Earning your own paycheck, buying your first car. We wanted all five of them to have those experiences on their own, so they have all started on their personal life tracks. In fact, the last two graduated from college just last week.

The United States suspended high-level strategic dialogue and downgraded joint military exercises after a coup, led by Prayuth, overthrew an elected civilian government in 2014. The invitation to the former army chief could signal a step by the United States toward re-establishing normal diplomatic relations with Thailand, its oldest ally in Asia. Washington has sought to rally cooperation among partners in Asia to pressure North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs, and to counter China's ambitions in the disputed waters of the South China Sea. Thai government spokesman Weerachon Sukondhapatipak told reporters that the talks would cover  trade, investment, commerce and security including security issues such as human trafficking.  He said the two governments were looking at fixing the visit for the end of July, but the dates had still to be confirmed. Trump has reached out to other authoritarian leaders in the region including Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, whose war on drugs has killed thousands. Rights groups fear Trump's  America First  policy will result in Washington soft pedaling on human rights issues, and the visit to Washington by the leader of the Thai coup is expected to draw criticism. The United States is Thailand's third-largest bilateral trading partner, after Japan and China.  In 2015, total two-way trade was estimated at over $37 billion. The United States is also one of the largest investors in Thailand, with over $11 billion in foreign direct investment in 2015. Last year, the U.S. government rewarded the Thai government for improving anti-trafficking efforts with an upgrade in its annual report on human trafficking. Thailand's agreement with Malaysia to build a wall to combat human trafficking across their porous border could strike a chord with Trump, who promised during his election campaign to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. So far few details have emerged on the proposed wall between the Southeast Asian neighbors.

Comey, who was investigating alleged ties between President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia, was fired in May. His testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for Trump's legislative agenda of rolling back healthcare reforms and overhauling the tax code. Investors will also watch out for the European Central Bank's meet, where policymakers are expected to take a more benign view of the economy, according to sources.  The indices are in a holding pattern, with a downside bias awaiting Thursday's key events, namely the Comey testimony, the ECB and GB elections,  Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York, wrote in a note.  On the other hand, investors abroad are rushing into Gold as the political situation in Great Britain and U.S. raises the level of 'Fear factor'.  Safe havens were in favor, with gold touching its highest in about seven weeks. Spot gold was up 0.96 percent at $1291.79 an ounce. At 9:33 a.m. ET (1333 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 46.07 points, or 0.22 percent, at 21,137.97 and the S&P; 500 was down 5.96 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,430.14. The Nasdaq Composite was down 12.43 points, or 0.2 percent, at 6,283.25. Nine of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with the financial index's 0.61 percent fall leading the decliners. Oil prices fell further below $50 a barrel on concerns that a diplomatic rift between Qatar and several Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, could undermine efforts by OPEC to tighten the market. Wall Street slipped on Monday as a drop in Apple partly offset gains in energy and financial stocks, some of the market's worst-performing sectors so far this year. Still, stocks continue to hover around record levels, helped by a strong first-quarter corporate earnings season. Shares of HD Supply Holdings were down 13.6 percent at $35.66 after the industrial distributor said it would sell a unit to private equity firm for $2.5 billion. Thor Industries was up 10.4 percent at $104.15 after the RV maker's quarterly results beat expectations. Michaels Cos  fell 5.5 percent to $18.81 after the crafts and home decor retailer slashed its forecast. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,906 to 614. On the Nasdaq, 1,701 issues fell and 544 advanced. The S&P; 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

Any such rapid-response team, the official said, is instead likely to be a function of Trump's outside counsel, Marc Kasowitz. White House officials had been discussing the possibility of hiring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to spearhead an internal  war room  to battle the various controversies emanating from a Justice Department probe into contacts between Trump aides and Russia.  If it exists, it won't be here,  the White House official told Reuters.  It would most likely be outside the White House.  But it is possible, the official added, that the White House could beef up its rapid-response operation as it does some retooling of Trump's communications effort. The official said it made more sense from a legal standpoint to have any Russia war room operation outside of the White House. Trump fired James Comey, former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on May 9 amid accusations that the president was trying to squelch a federal probe into the Russia claims. Comey is to testify before the U.S. Congress on Thursday to lay out the details of his conversations with the president about Russia before the firing. Trump has called the probe a  witch hunt  and said there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia.

Fitch has also downgraded the rating on Rcom's USD300 million 6.5% senior secured notes due 2020 to 'C/RR4' from 'CCC/RR4'. The downgrade follows Rcom's 2 June 2017 announcement that all of its bank lenders are prepared to waive debt service obligations until end-2017 to provide time for the company to lower its debt through two proposed transactions and present a plan demonstrating how the debt can be serviced over the long term. Under our rating definitions this situation constitutes a restricted default, as multiple waivers or forbearance periods have been extended in parallel following a non-payment event. KEY RATING DRIVERS Critical Liquidity Position: Rcom had poor liquidity at end-March 2017, with cash and equivalents of INR14 billion - insufficient to pay short-term debt of INR109 billion. Rcom's EBITDA declined by 30% to INR49 billion in the financial year to end-March 2017 (FY17), from INR71 billion in FY16, and is likely to be insufficient in FY18 to meet annual interest costs of INR35 billion and maintenance capex of INR15 billion. The company's management say that it will meet its coupon obligation due on 6 November, and there will be no cross-default prospect while the banks loans are in standstill; under the bond documents, non-payment of the bank loan may trigger a cross-default under the bond documents if such non-payment continues for 30 days following written notice from either 25% of the bondholders or the bond trustee. Deal Execution Risks: We believe weakening cash generation in the Indian wireless sector may hamper Rcom's plan to sell 51% of its tower business, Reliance Infratel Ltd. Reliance Infratel will have significant cash flow exposure to the proposed 50:50 wireless joint venture (JV) between Rcom and Aircel which faces merger execution risk as well as tough market conditions, although the JV's other tenant Reliance Jio is backed by Reliance Industries, rated 'BBB-'/Stable. Even if the tower business and wireless JV transactions occur and debt is paid down, we believe the residual business is likely to be saddled with excessive debt. The transactions are subject to approval from lenders, shareholders and the Indian telecom regulator. The standstill provides Rcom with seven months to complete the transactions. During this time, Rcom will also provide a sustainable long-term plan to service its remaining debt of at least INR200 billion. According to Rcom, the standstill requires lenders' formal approval, which, given the company's critical liquidity, we expect to be obtained. DERIVATION SUMMARY Under our rating definitions the standstill constitutes a restricted default as multiple waivers or forbearance periods have been extended in parallel following a non-payment event. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Delays in executing tower sale and demerger of wireless unit, leading to inadequate liquidity to pay short-term debt. - Analytical deconsolidation of wireless JV, Infratel and subsidiary Global Cloud Xchange (GCX) businesses because of their inability to provide cash to support Rcom's creditors. - The wireless JV, Infratel and GCX do not require equity from Rcom. - Sale of 51% ownership in Infratel to lower debt by INR110 billion. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Improvement in Rcom's liquidity position such that it can pay its short-term obligations. Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -Rcom entering into bankruptcy filings, administration, receivership, liquidation or other formal winding-up procedures, or otherwise ceasing business. LIQUIDITY Poor Liquidity: Cash and equivalents were INR14 billion at end-March 2017 - insufficient to repay short-term debt of INR109 billion. The standstill helps liquidity in the short term, although the company will not be able to meet its obligations unless execution of the transactions is successful.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The third attempt to link up London and Frankfurt ended in March after it faced opposition from European Union competition regulators, and from German officials who opposed the head office being based in Britain. The collapse has left exchanges looking at smaller or  quiet advances  in mergers and acquisitions, such as in financial technology, data and other content, Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Carsten Kengeter told an IDX derivatives conference. Kengeter said the political mood was becoming more national, going against the grain of global capital markets, and rival CME Group (CME.O) also suggested incremental rather than  big bang  moves. CME president Bryan Durkin said the Chicago based exchange would continue to build up its services to Europe from the United States after deciding to shut its London based clearing and trading platforms.

The IRC has seen a drop in the number of people escaping Raqqa over the past week, which may indicate ISIS intends to use the 200,000 people still trapped in the city as human shields,  the IRC's Middle East Director of Public Affairs Thomas Garofalo said in a statement. ISIS is another acronym for Islamic State.   Those who try to escape once SDF forces advance further into the city risk being killed from mines and ISIS snipers as well as airstrikes,  Garofalo said.  IRC health teams responding north of Raqqa city have treated people injured by mines as they attempted to cross the frontline.   Islamic State captured Raqqa from rebel groups in 2014.

But corporate, mortgages and consumer lending that has turned bad during years of crisis still accounts for slightly more than half of the banking sector's overall loan book, data released by the Bank of Greece revealed. A mountain of non-performing exposures (NPEs), comprising non-performing loans (NPLs) and restructured loans likely to turn bad, is the biggest challenge facing Greek banking. Greek banks began the economic crisis in 2008 with NPEs of 14.5 billion euros ($16.32 billion) or 5.5 percent of loans. Cutting these would free up more capital to fund productive sectors of the economy, which is still struggling. While NPEs soared to 106.9 billion or 50.5 percent at the end of June last year, banks trimmed the figure to 103.9 billion euros, excluding off-balance sheet items, in the first three months of the year, beating a target of 105.2 billion. Their NPE ratio was on target at 50.6 percent at the end of the first quarter, while on NPLs, loans past due for more than 90 days, banks missed the target as the rate came to 36.7 percent at the end of March versus a targeted 36.05 percent.  Despite the still strong formation of new NPEs, especially in the first two months of the year, banks managed to reduce them further mainly as a result of writedowns amounting to 1.3 billion euros,  the central bank said. The Bank of Greece, which monitors the implementation of lenders' NPE action plans in cooperation with the European Central Bank, said that while the default rate slowed, it remained higher than the pace of loans were performing again. Banks have agreed with regulators on ambitious bad debt reduction targets over three years. Greece's four major banks - Piraeus, National , Eurobank and Alpha - and three less systemic banks submit data on nine operational targets. Their aim is to cut NPEs to 66.7 billion euros or 33.9 percent of their loan books by 2019 from 106.9 billion euros last September, when the targets were agreed. Banks also aim to reduce their NPL rate to 20.4 percent by December 2019 from 37 percent in September.

Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, retreated on concerns that a diplomatic rift between Qatar and several Arab states including Saudi Arabia could undermine efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to tighten the market.                  U.S. crude        prices were down 0.27 percent at $47.27 a barrel.      The Bank of Canada on Thursday will release its review of developments in the financial system, followed by a news conference with Governor Stephen Poloz. Investors will weigh his assessment of the health of the housing and mortgage markets in light of recent troubles at nonbank lender Home Capital Group Inc         .         A European Central Bank meeting, a parliamentary election in the UK and testimony by James Comey, former director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, to a Senate committee are also due on Thursday, while Canada's employment report for May is due on Friday.     At 9:08 a.m. ET (1308 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3471 to the greenback, or 74.23 U.S. cents, nearly unchanged.     The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3485, while it touched its strongest since May 31 at C$1.3444.     The United States has asked Canada to eliminate a new  underhanded  dairy-pricing class that has undercut sales by U.S. dairies to Canadian processors, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Monday.                  Perdue's comments come as the United States has signaled it wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.     U.S. Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar        dropped to seven-month lows and world stocks slid as political uncertainty from the United States to the Middle East and weakness in commodity markets pushed investors away from risky assets.

The projection follows a strong first quarter for emerging market investment that saw the strongest portfolio inflows since 2014. The IIF's projection is $290 billion higher than its estimate just four months ago, shortly after Donald Trump took office as U.S. president and the organization listed possible American protectionism as its top threat to emerging market portfolio flow growth. The risk of trade friction between the U.S. and Mexico and China, has waned significantly, said Hung Tran, IIF's executive managing director, as has the risk of the U.S. Federal Reserve quickly tightening monetary policy.  Looking back at the first five months of the year, it is clear that near-term threats of trade conflict have subsided significantly,  Tran said.  All the threat of naming China as currency manipulators, the increase in tariffs, abandonment of NAFTA did not come to pass.  The IIF projects non-resident inflows to increase by $252 billion this year from 2016.  Assuming ongoing improvement in global and EM growth and a gradual, well-communicated path of Fed tightening through 2018, we are now a bit more optimistic on EM capital flows,  Tran said. Non-resident portfolio inflows are expected to rise to more than $1 trillion in 2018, IIF also said, the first time inflows have breached that level since 2014. Capital inflows from non-residents had fallen to a 12-year low in 2015. Despite the rebound in capital inflows from foreigners, IIF anticipates overall net capital outflows from emerging markets, led by resident capital outflows from China. The organization expects resident capital outflows to hit $892 billion this year, a decline by $141 billion from 2016, and for outflows to reduce further in 2018. Outflows from China alone, which leads emerging market economies in capital leaving local markets, rose to a record $725 billion last year.  All of this moderation is due to China, which has used capital controls to clamp down on outward investment with some degree of success,  said Scott Farnham, IIF's senior research analyst, global macroeconomics, in the report. All told, the institute is expecting to see overall net capital outflows, which includes resident and non-residents from emerging markets, of $130 billion. It had estimated outflows from its group of 25 emerging market economies would total $490 billion this year in its February report.

Officials in the western city believe explosives were hidden in a motorcycle left in a parking area outside the Jama Masjid, a large mosque dating from the 12th century, known for its intricate blue tiles. Abdul Ahad Walizada, spokesman for Herat police, said at least seven people were killed and 15 wounded as they made their way to the mosque for prayers during Islam's holy month of Ramadan. A spokesman for the Taliban, which has been waging a 16-year insurgency against the Western-backed Afghan government, denied involvement in the attack. Near the border with Iran, Herat is one of Afghanistan's largest cities. The attack came after a spate of violence in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, where on Wednesday more than 150 people were killed and hundreds wounded in a suicide truck-bomb attack.     Several protesters were killed in clashes with police on Friday at the bomb site, and at least a dozen people were killed when suicide bombers attacked the funeral for one of the dead protesters on Saturday.

Speaking in a live interview on CNBC, Guajardo also said he believed there were grounds to believe that NAFTA can be renegotiated to benefit the United States, Canada and Mexico. He said, however, that  Plan B  for Mexico would be to revert to World Trade Organization tariff rates for exports to the United States such as the 2.5 percent tariff for passenger cars.  Obviously, (it is) a little bit more expensive, but it's not the end of the world,  he added. He said that the Chinese content of cars traded between North American countries was very low, about 3 percent, largely using parts that are no longer produced in the region, such as flat panel display screens and other electronic items.  This idea that Mexico is being used as a back door for Chinese imports into the U.S. is not the right one,  he said. Under the current NAFTA agreement, motor vehicles must have 62.5 percent North American content, a figure that U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said is too low and allows for too much content from other regions to benefit from NAFTA tariff-free status. Guajardo warned that raising the bar too high on North American content could make the region less competitive.  We can make an effort to strengthen that, no question about it. But if you go too far, you may be shooting yourself in the foot, because you're losing competitiveness,  he said. Negotiations to modernize the 23-year-old NAFTA trade deal are expected to start after Aug. 16, at the conclusion of a U.S. government consultation period with lawmakers, industries and the public. Guajardo also said that he and Ross were close to announcing an agreement on sugar trade between the two countries.

Grimes,Donald Thorpe,Gerry Glombicki,Hannah James,Laurel Assurance,Fitch Affirms Progressive's Ratings; Outlook Stable,Credit / Debt Ratings,Americas,Insurance (TRBC),Debt / Fixed Income Markets,Financials (TRBC),Financials (Legacy),Corporate Events,United States","sector":"","content":"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Progressive Corporation's (NYSE: PGR) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+', senior debt ratings at 'A', and junior subordinated debt rating at 'BBB+'. Fitch also affirms Progressive's operating subsidiaries' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at 'AA'. A complete list of ratings follows the end of the release. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings are based on Progressive's very strong operating performance and risk-based capital position, market leading risk-management and underwriting expertise, and its significant personal and commercial auto insurance franchise. Progressive is the fourth-largest U.S. private passenger auto writer and largest commercial auto writer based on 2016 premiums written. Progressive reported a GAAP combined ratio of 90.9% through the first four months of 2017, down from 95.1% for full-year 2016. Embedded in PGR's culture is obtaining a GAAP calendar year combined ratio of 96% or better. Fitch continues to view Progressive as one of the strongest underwriters among major property/casualty companies, and recognizes the company's history of favorable underwriting margins and stability. Capitalization at the operating company level scored 'Very Strong' based on year-end 2015 data on Prism, Fitch's proprietary capital model. Prism results for 2016 will be available in late summer 2017. Total shareholders' equity increased by 10.3% through the first four months of 2017, to nearly $8.8 billion at April 30, 2017. Equity growth was driven by net earnings of $621 million and $190 million of unrealized investment gains through the first four months of 2017. Progressive issued $850 million of 30-year senior notes in April 2017. Net proceeds from the issuance are expected to be used to redeem $564 million of its junior subordinated debentures due in 2067 on June 15, 2017. The remaining net proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. Progressive's financial leverage as of April 30, 2017 was 31.2%. Pro forma leverage as of the same date, including the expected redemption of the company's junior subordinated debentures, will decrease to 28%. Progressive's profitability promotes very strong interest coverage. GAAP fixed-charge coverage, excluding realized gains, in 2016 was 11.1x, down from the five-year average between 2012 - 2016 of 12.5x. Fitch believes that GAAP fixed-charge coverage will range from high single-digits to low double-digits over the near term, including the new senior note issuance. RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that could lead to a ratings downgrade include the following: --Obtaining a GAAP calendar year combined ratio of 99% or higher; --Failure to maintain a Prism score of 'Very Strong' or better; --Financial leverage above 30%; --Homeowners' growth that substantially increases probable maximum loss (PML) levels; --Failure to maintain statutory maximum dividend coverage ratio of 7x or higher on a sustained basis; --A meaningful change to the auto insurance market that unfavorably alters the operating environment. Fitch believes that a ratings upgrade for Progressive would require a broadened product focus with a material reduction of net leverage. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: The Progressive Corporation --IDR at 'A+'; --$500 million 3.75% due 2021 at 'A'; --$500 million 2.45% due 2027 at 'A'; --$300 million 6.625% due 2029 at 'A'; --$400 million 6.25% due 2032 at 'A'; --$350 million 4.35% due 2044 at 'A'; --$400 million 3.70% due 2045 at 'A'; --$850 million 4.125% due 2047 at 'A'; --Junior subordinated debentures 6.7% due 2067 at 'BBB+'.

Speaking in a live interview on CNBC, Guajardo also said he believed there were grounds to believe that NAFTA can be renegotiated to benefit the United States, Canada and Mexico. He said, however, that  Plan B  for Mexico would be to revert to World Trade Organization tariff rates for exports to the United States such as the 2.5 percent tariff for passenger cars.  Obviously, (it is) a little bit more expensive, but it's not the end of the world,  he added. He said that the Chinese content of cars traded between North American countries was very low, about 3 percent, largely using parts that are no longer produced in the region, such as flat panel display screens and other electronic items.  This idea that Mexico is being used as a back door for Chinese imports into the U.S. is not the right one,  he said. Under the current NAFTA agreement, motor vehicles must have 62.5 percent North American content, a figure that U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said is too low and allows for too much content from other regions to benefit from NAFTA tariff-free status. Guajardo warned that raising the bar too high on North American content could make the region less competitive.  We can make an effort to strengthen that, no question about it. But if you go too far, you may be shooting yourself in the foot, because you're losing competitiveness,  he said. Negotiations to modernize the 23-year-old NAFTA trade deal are expected to start after Aug. 16, at the conclusion of a U.S. government consultation period with lawmakers, industries and the public. Guajardo also said that he and Ross were close to announcing an agreement on sugar trade between the two countries.

Missing from the general meeting of the International Air Transport Association in Mexico was Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker. Usually a star of the show, he appeared to have left the summit amid a dispute between Arab powers. Asked about Saudi Arabia and Bahrain's move to ban Qatari planes from their airports and airspace, IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac called for openness.  We would like borders to be reopened, the sooner the better,  he told reporters, expanding on earlier remarks in the opening session. Related CoverageBritish Airways commissions independent study of IT outageAirbus says may have to cut A380 production further Aviation is globalization at its very best,  he had told executives from IATA's more than 200 airlines.  As aviation's leaders, we must bear witness to the achievements of our connected world.  Qatar Airways could not be reached for comment. The Arab rift was a stark reminder of the political risks to the airlines, which have run up healthy profits even as the global consensus they rely upon comes under the threat of nationalist and protectionist political currents. A sign announcing the June 4-6 meeting of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is seen at a hotel in Cancun, Mexico June 4, 2017.Victor Ruiz GarciaForecasting a third straight year of robust earnings, IATA raised its 2017 industry profit outlook on Monday to $31.4 billion, up from a previous forecast of $29.8 billion. The IATA also raised its outlook for 2017 industry revenue to $743 billion from $736 billion on expectations that the global economy will post its strongest growth in six years. The forecast underscored a new golden age for airlines' profitability even as carriers scramble to meet fast-changing electronics restrictions, pressure to limit emissions and unprecedented scrutiny on social media over their every mistake. A United Nations representative urged airline leaders to stand by an industry emissions accord known as CORSIA even as U.S. President Donald Trump breaks with a climate pact struck in Paris last year.  We need to promote implementation of this historic agreement,  said Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, president of the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization. IATA's de Juniac said the airlines would hold fast to their commitments.  The very disappointing decision of the U.S. to withdraw from Paris is not a setback for CORSIA,  he told the meeting.  We remain united behind CORSIA and our climate change goals.

Much of the land around the reserve has been cleared of trees. Grazing land for cattle now stretches as far as the eye can see from the highway, destroying what used to be the mighty Amazon rainforest.  Thirty years ago, this was all untouched forest,  said Cosme da Silva, a local activist with the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) in Boca do Acre, in the southwest corner of Amazonas State.  Today all of this has been taken over by 'grileiros' (land grabbers) who destroyed it to raise cattle,  Silva told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from the passenger seat of a 4x4 truck driving past deforested land and into the reserve. As politicians plan a radical shift in how land for Brazil's 900,000 aboriginal people is demarcated, environmentalists say places like Reserve 124, where territory is formally owned by indigenous communities, represent the best chance to save endangered forests. [nL8N1IA5LI]  I am certain we are better at preserving the forests than other nearby communities,  said Chief Geraldo Apurina, standing on the porch of his hand-built home inside the reserve, as chickens pecked for scraps in his shaded yard. Harvest Without Harm The Apurina indigenous community received formal ownership of the 450 sq km (175 sq mile) of land in 1988 when Brazil emerged from a military dictatorship and signed a new constitution guaranteeing indigenous rights. Prior to demarcation, residents constantly faced violence from ranchers and farmers who wanted the land, said Maria Jose Apurina, 40, a mother of four and the chief's wife.   I've seen blood spilled (for this),  she said, sitting in her wooden home.  But now that we have the land it's better for our children... this is our place.  Reserve residents, who number around 800, make a living fishing and hunting on the land and harvesting nuts and acai berries which grow there naturally, said Apurina, 57.       We only harvest the nuts – we don't harm the trees,  he said - a claim backed up by research. Forest in the Amazon where indigenous communities formally own their land is much better protected than similar non-demarcated areas, according to a study by American scientists in Peru's rainforest published in April, backing the findings of two previous studies. [nL5N1H66IT] In Brazil's Amazon, an area larger than Germany has been deforested since 1988, according to government data. After years of declines, the rate of deforestation shot up by 29 percent last year compared to 2015, according to Brazil's National Space Research Institute (INPE). [nL5N1HB631] At this rate, environmentalists say the government will not be able to meet its goal of net zero deforestation in the Amazon by 2030. Forests controlled by indigenous people, in contrast, are among the best protected in Brazil, Luciano Evaristo, a senior official with the Brazilian government's environmental enforcement agency (IBAMA), told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. And demarcating land for indigenous communities is among the cheapest strategies for protecting the Amazon, he said. Brazilian indigenous chief Geraldo Apurina, 57, conducts an interview on inside of Indigenous Reserve 124 in Amazonas State, Brazil on May 25, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Chris Arsenault'Indians Should Decide' But formal plans to allocate new lands for indigenous people have been on hold for months and indigenous leaders are concerned that political moves will put an end to their claims. Lawmakers are planning a major transformation in Brazil's National Indian Foundation (FUNAI), the government agency that has sought to protect tribes by guaranteeing their land so they can preserve their cultures. [nL8N1I74Q5] The body is ineffective, beholden to  external interests  and makes its land demarcation decisions based on flawed data, according to a report on FUNAI's future from lawmakers and published in May. [nL2N1II0OT] FUNAI's budget has been cut by more than 40 percent in the past year.  The organization is outdated, say rural lawmakers, who have proposed changes in how it demarcates land, including opening indigenous reserves to mining companies.  There are Indians who want to become miners and producers, and they should have the freedom to decide for themselves,  Congressman Nilson Leitao, the report's author and a leading figure in Brazil's rural lobby said in May. Slideshow (3 Images) FUNAI has been over-protective and paternalistic... The Indians could be living on a big mine while their people die of hunger,  he said of communities often steeped in poverty. Waiting for Land Francisco da Silva de Araujo, 56, is an indigenous leader from the community of Valparaiso, whose ancestral land in the Amazon basin has not been formally demarcated.  He said proposed changes at FUNAI could spell the end to his peoples' hope of owning their own land, hurting Amazon conservation efforts in the process.  We have been fighting to have our land demarcated since 1991,  Araujo said following a meeting with FUNAI officials in Amazonas State about his tribe's long-standing claim.  We are very worried about these changes at FUNAI.  His community has been facing regular incursions from outsiders who have been coming to cut down trees, Araujo said.  Without formal land rights, there isn't much the two dozen extended families in his community can do to protect the forest.  Grileiros have invaded the area,  Araujo said. In one case, farmers armed with scythes threatened indigenous residents. Wagner Gallo, a local FUNAI official in Amazonas State, said budget cuts and proposed political changes have hurt the agency's ability to help people like Chief Araujo. Even before the latest budget cuts, the organization was struggling, the government official said. In the region around Boca do Acre it has laid off about 15 percent of staff.  The numbers show that demarcating land for the indigenous is the best way to protect the forest,  Gallo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation following a meeting with Araujo and other indigenous leaders.  The communities themselves often protect the forest – when someone invades, they report it,  Gallo said.  But there are economic interests eyeing indigenous land.

The credit facility includes a $900 million revolving loan facility, an $800 million six-month term loan credit facility and a $300 million three-year term loan facility. The revolving loan facility, which expires May 30, 2022, will replace the company's existing $700 million revolving loan facility. Proceeds from the term loans and notes, along with excess cash, will be used to fund Coach's proposed $2.4 billion acquisition of Kate Spade & Company. Coach expects to use excess cash to repay the $800 million six-month term loan upon maturity. The proposed acquisition, which represents an EBITDA multiple of 9x on an LTM basis, is expected to close in Coach's first fiscal quarter of 2018, assuming regulatory approval. Coach's ratings are currently on Rating Watch Negative, and Fitch anticipates a one-notch downgrade of Coach's IDR to 'BBB-' upon completion of the transaction as proposed. The acquisition would cause Coach's leverage to increase from the current 2.6x level to 3.7x on a pro forma basis at closing and decline to around 3.3x at the end of FY 2018 upon the repayment of the $800 million six-month term loan. Leverage is expected to trend to under 3.0x over the following two years on EBITDA growth. The anticipated rating also reflects integration risk from potential changes to Kate Spade's growth strategies, and the addition of a young, rapidly grown brand to Coach's portfolio. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Proposed Kate Spade Purchase Acquisition Kate Spade is a global specialty soft goods retailer that designs and markets women's, men's and children's accessories and apparel under the kate spade new york and Jack Spade brands. Kate Spade generated $1.4 billion in sales and $264 million in EBITDA, for a 19.2% margin, in the LTM ended April 1, 2017. While handbags and small leather goods drive approximately 70% of the company's sales, the company has recently sought to diversify its mix through product introductions in other accessories, apparel and home categories. Products are sold through wholly owned specialty retail and outlet stores and wholesale distribution at select specialty retail and upscale department stores, such as Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdales. Approximately 75% of Kate Spade's revenue is generated in the direct-to-consumer segment, while the remaining 25% comes from the wholesale and licensing channels. Additionally, approximately 20% of revenues are generated online. Kate Spade grew brand revenues at a compound annual rate of nearly 40% from 2010 to 2015. Growth was predicated on square footage growth in the U.S., international expansion, and double-digit annual comps between 2010 and 2015. Comps slowed meaningfully to the mid-single digits in 2016 and turned negative 2.4% in first quarter of 2017 due to reduced promotions, weak tourist traffic caused by the stronger U.S. dollar and a general slowdown in luxury spend. Pro forma for the acquisition, Coach will generate almost $6 billion in sales and $1.4 billion in EBITDA. From a qualitative standpoint, Fitch views the addition of Kate Spade to Coach's portfolio as neutral to modestly negative given the rapid rise of the young brand that creates a higher risk of the brand falling out of favor and the targeted changes to the company's operating strategy through pullback of online flash sales. Coach expects to realize approximately $50 million of run-rate cost synergies within three years of acquisition close, which will be evenly split between cost of goods sold and SG&A.; Fitch views these synergies as modest but reasonable relative to the combined EBITDA base (at around 4% of total EBITDA). Standalone Coach Coach's current ratings reflect the company's strong position in the premium bag and small leather goods market as well as reasonable credit metrics despite recent EBITDA headwinds. Since fiscal year (FY) 2013, the company has seen significant sales declines in its North American (NA) business, now representing approximately 60% of total sales and EBITDA. Reported international sales growth has averaged approximately 4% since FY 2013, as growth in China and Coach's entry in Europe has been mitigated by a decline in Japan and currency headwinds. The approximately 40% decline in consolidated EBITDA to $1.1 billion in FY 2015 and FY 2016 from $1.9 billion in FY 2013, coupled with the company's issuance of $900 million in senior unsecured debt in March 2015 to support the purchase and construction of its new headquarters, has resulted in adjusted leverage increasing to 2.6x from 1.4x at the end of FY 2014, in line with Fitch's expectations. Coach's North American Sales Improving NA revenue, which has declined since FY 2013, appears to be stabilizing, with comps improving from -9.5% in 1Q 2016 to 3% in 3Q 2017. Comps are expected to be modestly positive in 4Q 2016 (around 2.5% for the full year) and positive low-single digits beginning FY 2018. NA EBITDA after corporate overhead has declined from $1.1 billion in FY 2013 (32% of sales) to $412 million in FY 2016 (17% of sales), and is expected to be in this range in FY 2017. Coach has undertaken a number of actions to reposition the brand further upscale, with the intention to increase the penetration of full-price sales and higher price point purchases. First, Stuart Vevers, the company's creative director who joined in September 2013, has evolved the product mix with a view toward an innovative, design-led and editorial offering. Second, Coach has invested in remodels of owned stores and department store presentations, yielding positive sales results. The remodels have continued in FY 2017 and the company plans to end the year with over 700 remodeled locations (or about 70% of the total store base) globally versus 450 locations last year. Third, Coach has restructured its promotional cadence by reducing the amount of periodic sale events. Finally, Coach has refocused its marketing efforts away from price point and event messaging to a product-focused platform across e-mail, social media, and fashion industry activity. The combination of the above have yielded stabilization in Coach's operating performance in FY 2016 and FY 2017, improving Fitch's confidence in its projections of positive annual comps beginning 2017. Coupled with modest declines in square footage, Fitch expects modestly positive NA sales growth annually. Comps and EBITDA in recent quarters have stabilized despite continued challenges for many mid-tier mall-based apparel and accessories retailers. Fitch assumes slight EBITDA margin expansion from trough FY 2015-FY 2016 levels; however, the fashion nature of Coach's assortment, coupled with its recent volatile history, could lead to either to material downside or upside risk to our expectations. International Sales Stability International sales, which represent approximately 40% of revenue, have been less volatile, with a 4% increase in FY 2015 and 9% in FY 2016 (constant currency basis). Despite increasing economic headwinds, China has continued its growth trajectory, becoming Coach's largest international market in FY 2016 at $652 million, while Europe has had the highest growth rate, albeit from a small base. Japan, Coach's second largest international market at approximately $560 million in FY 2016 revenue, has seen positive mid-single digit constant currency growth in FY 2016 after experiencing a modest constant currency decline in FY 2015. Fitch expects annual sales growth beginning FY 2017 to trend in the mid-to-high single digits, predicated on mid-single-digit growth in China and significant square footage expansion in Europe. Stable Credit Metrics Despite a 42% decline in EBITDA from peak fiscal 2013 levels to FY 2016 levels, credit metrics remain reasonable with LTM adjusted debt/EBITDAR leverage of 2.6x. Fitch expects standalone leverage to remain in the 2.6x to 2.7x range over the next 24 to 26 months, with EBITDA growth in FY 2017 and onwards and the $293 million term loan repayment being somewhat offset by increased capitalized rent from the headquarters sale-leaseback and expansion in China and Europe. Assuming the Kate Spade acquisition closes, leverage is expected to be 3.7x at close on a pro forma basis and decline to 3.3x at end of FY 2018 following pay down of the expected $800 million six-month term loan. Leverage is expected to trend to under 3.0x two years post acquisition close on EBITDA growth. Standalone Coach FCF is expected to be about $120 million in FY 2017 and increase to $350 million to $400 million annually over the next two to three years as remodelling activity moderates and capex declines to about $200 million. FCF assuming the transaction closes in FY 2018 is expected to be around $200 million in FY 2018 and increase to around $400 million annually thereafter driven by EBITDA growth. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects reported sales growth to be flattish in FY 2017 for standalone Coach. NA Coach brand sales are expected to be up modestly and international sales down modestly. NA comps are expected to be around 2.5% in FY 2017 and positive low-single digits thereafter, with continued expansion in Europe driving low- to mid-single digit company-wide annual revenue growth. Assuming the acquisition closes in the beginning of FY 2018, revenues are expected to grow almost 40% to reflect the inclusion of Kate Spade. --FY 2017 standalone EBITDA is expected to up low-single digits at $1.1 billion, driven by improvement in NA comp stores sales and improve to $1.2 billion by FY 2019/FY 2020. Including Kate Spade, EBITDA is expected to be $1.4 billion in FY 2018 and improve to $1.6 billion thereafter, including the around $50 million of expected run-rate synergies. --Standalone FCF is expected to be about $120 million in FY 2017 and increase to $350 million to $400 million annually over the next two to three years on moderating capex. FCF including Kate Spade is expected to be around $200 million in FY 2018 and increase to around $400 million annually thereafter driven by EBITDA growth. --Adjusted leverage on a standalone basis is expected to remain in the 2.6x to 2.7x range over the next 24 to 26 months driven by EBITDA growth and $293 million term loan repayment being somewhat offset by increased capitalized rent from the headquarters sale-leaseback and expansion in China and Europe. Adjusted leverage including Kate Spade is expected to be 3.7x at close on a pro forma basis and decline to 3.3x at end of FY 2018 following pay down of the expected $800 million six-month term loan. Leverage is expected to trend to under 3.0x two years post acquisition close on EBITDA growth. RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action would result from Coach's core NA comparable store sales growing in line with or better than the low- to mid-single digit growth which Fitch expects for the domestic luxury space, and total EBITDA improving to the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion range, driving leverage to the low 2x range. A negative rating action could result from worse than expected top-line, profitability and cash flow trends driven by the inability to stabilize its market share in the low- to mid-tier luxury market; a slowdown in the momentum of Coach's international business; and/or a sustained increase in leverage above the mid-2x range. LIQUIDITY As of April 1, 2017, Coach had $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, of which approximately 70% was overseas. Coach has a $900 million unsecured domestic facility with a maturity date of May 30, 2022. Historically, Coach has generated strong FCF (after dividends) of $700 million to $800 million between FY 2011 through FY 2013. However, FCF dropped to approximately $390 million and $365 million FY 2014 and FY 2015, respectively, on significant EBITDA declines and spending on the new headquarters. FCF was negative $12 million in FY 2016 driven by $146 million capex spend on the new headquarters and higher interest costs. Coach sold its interest in its headquarters in August 2016 and subsequently paid down its $293 million senior unsecured term loan.

Saudi Arabia and the port of Fujairah in United Arab Emirates announced on Monday they were barring Qatari-flagged ships. Bahraini port authorities have also suspended  marine navigation from and to the State of Qatar  with effect from Tuesday, a notice from Inchcape Shipping Services said. The notice also made clear that the Saudi ban includes all vessels sailing to or from Qatar, regardless of flag, and that the UAE's Das Port Authority had banned Qatari-flagged vessels, or ships sailing to or from Qatar, from calling into any Abu Dhabi petroleum port. The decision by Fujairah, a regional ship re-fuelling hub, to deny access to Qatari-flagged ships or ships heading to or from Qatar will force those ships to sail further for fuel or to pay higher prices. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, along with Egypt, Yemen and Bahrain, cut diplomatic ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Around half a dozen oil, chemical and liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers coming from Qatar have left UAE waters or halted in the open ocean instead of docking in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned, according to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon. Qatar is the world's biggest LNG exporter, shipping the fuel used in power generation to users in Japan, China and India, and the country also exports about 620,000 barrels per day of oil, among the smallest Middle East oil producers. Vessels leaving Qatari ports typically refuel before their voyages at Fujairah, the Gulf's largest ship-fuel or bunkering port. That is leaving shipowners and charters scrambling to plan the logistics for their vessels.  It's a big mess this morning,  said a Singapore-based shipbroker. The Britanis super-tanker, capable of carrying up to 2 million barrels of oil, was parked in Fujairah's anchorage zone for the past week, but since Monday moved to just beyond Fujairah's port limits, Eikon data showed. Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, which ships pass on their way to Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world's most important ports for the global energy market. Besides refuelling, vessels also merge cargoes with those of other tankers before sending blended supplies to their final destination. Ships looking to fuel in Fujairah may incur delays and higher costs after being forced to divert to nearby regional ports, or to Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India, and even as far away as Singapore, shippers and traders said.  Some of the affected vessels sailing out of the Gulf will probably have to look towards Iraq, Iran, or Oman for bunkers, however, it depends on the political stance of those countries,” said commodities broker Matt Stanley at Freight Investor Services in Dubai. Blocking the Qatari vessels could displace up to 25 percent of the between 800,000 and 900,000 tonnes of marine fuels sold in Fujairah each month, said two trade sources familiar with the market. Because of the small size of its oil exports, Qatari crude tends to be co-loaded onto tankers along with other regional crudes to make the voyage economical. That process may also be disrupted because of the ban. The Aramco-owned supertanker Asian Progress V, which is under a Singaporean flag and carrying Qatar Land crude, is due to load additional Saudi crude at Saudi Arabia's Ras Tanura Abu Sa'fah berth and hopes to escape the ban because it arrived before the restriction was announced.  The Asian Progress V is going to berth soon and the pilot is on board,  a shipping source with knowledge of the matter said.  The vessel arrived on the 4th so they are arguing that the ban does not apply to this vessel.  Oil-pricing agency S&P; Global Platts said on Tuesday it was reviewing the use of Qatari Al-Shaheen crude in its oil price assessments because of the port ban. Besides disrupting energy exports, the UAE ban on Qatari ships is affecting aluminium exports. Norsk Hydro said on Tuesday Qatari metal exports that typically were reloaded on larger ships at the UAE port of Jebel Ali have been blocked.

Representatives of the RBoS Shareholder Action Group had written to their members last week to say they would accept RBS's revised out-of-court offer in a decision supported by its legal advisers, Signature Litigation. But Scottish businessman Neil Mitchell, a former RBS customer, investor and critic, said on Monday that a faction within the shareholder group had raised the necessary cash to push the case to trial regardless. In the latest twist, two sources told Reuters that the group's lawyers had now advised rebel shareholders against a trial because of the spiraling costs. Investors have already been told that current legal and other costs will reduce their payout by 40-45 percent. A spokesman for Signature Litigation said only:  We have not been contacted by any shareholders to continue the action . Mitchell called a move to settle the case  strange . RBS, which has denied any wrongdoing in the run-up to its 12 billion pound ($15.45 billion) rights issue in 2008, declined to comment. One source said a hearing scheduled at the High Court in London on Wednesday will give a formal indication of where the action group stands. Bill Rises for Rbs The bank remains more than 70 percent state-owned since its near collapse during the credit crisis left investors nursing losses of around 80 percent. RBS, which has settled similar cases with four other investor groups, raised its offer to 82 pence per share, or around 200 million pounds ($258 million), from about 43 pence, the day before the case was due to go to trial two weeks ago. The final offer remains a fraction of the 200 to 230 pence per share that shareholders paid for RBS shares in 2008 and denies investors the prospect of seeing Goodwin cross-examined in court. Goodwin became a symbol of banker recklessness and greed during the credit crisis. But lawyers have said the case could have dragged on for years before a court established that RBS was liable for investor losses and quantified any damages. RBS has already offered around 900 million pounds in other settlements so far to avoid a costly and potentially embarrassing lawsuit. RBS investors, including thousands of current and former RBS employees, had alleged the bank's former executives deliberately hid its over-stretched finances and failed to disclose that the regulator had ordered it to raise cash when asking investors to stump up a then-record 12 billion pounds. Just months later, the government was forced to step in with a record 45.8 billion pound bank bailout.

The FBI assistant legal attache attended a court martial on Tuesday, it said in a statement, adding he would consult local authorities about helping to investigate and prosecute the case.  The murder and rape occurred during an attack on the Terrain Hotel in Juba on July 11, 2016 as President Salva Kiir's troops won a three-day battle in the capital against opposition forces loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar. The attack, one of the worst on aid workers in South Sudan's civil war, lasted for several hours. A South Sudanese aid worker was killed and at least five women, including foreigners, were raped during the attack.  Following the attack by SPLA forces on the Terrain Hotel Compound ... which included an assault on U.S. citizens, the U.S. government asked the government of ... South Sudan to permit the FBI to assist in the investigation and the prosecution,  the U.S. Embassy in Juba said in a statement.  The Minister of Justice subsequently extended an invitation to the FBI to provide forensic assistance.      At the hearing on Tuesday, the judge adjourned the trial for two weeks after the army removed Abubaker Mohammed, its chief prosecutor, over the weekend.  Mohammed told Reuters he had been assigned to a different mission but gave no further details.  He had previously said 18 soldiers and three civilians would face charges, but only 12 suspects were present at Tuesday's hearing. It was unclear where the other nine suspects were. Rights groups have questioned the trial's fairness because it is being held in a military court not easily accessible to witnesses or the public.  The courts are staffed by military personnel who are within the hierarchy of the military and therefore the independence of this military courts is questionable,  Amnesty International's Elizabeth Deng told Reuters.  Deng also raised concern over a lack of formal charges even though suspects were arrested last year. The South Sudan Human Rights Observatory has also criticized the trial as a  sham  and called for an independent, international investigation into all crimes of sexual violence. U.S. congressman Chris Smith, who raised the issue of the trial with Kiir in a trip to Juba last week, said in a statement that their ambassador to South Sudan, Molly Phee, told him the trial  became a reality  when the government learned of his impending visit.

Representatives of the RBoS Shareholder Action Group had written to their members last week to say they would accept RBS's revised out-of-court offer in a decision supported by its legal advisers, Signature Litigation. But Scottish businessman Neil Mitchell, a former RBS customer, investor and critic, said on Monday that a faction within the shareholder group had raised the necessary cash to push the case to trial regardless. In the latest twist, two sources told Reuters that the group's lawyers had now advised rebel shareholders against a trial because of the spiraling costs. Investors have already been told that current legal and other costs will reduce their payout by 40-45 percent. A spokesman for Signature Litigation said only:  We have not been contacted by any shareholders to continue the action . Mitchell called a move to settle the case  strange . RBS, which has denied any wrongdoing in the run-up to its 12 billion pound ($15.45 billion) rights issue in 2008, declined to comment.  One source said a hearing scheduled at the High Court in London on Wednesday will give a formal indication of where the action group stands. Bill Rises for Rbs The bank remains more than 70 percent state-owned since its near collapse during the credit crisis left investors nursing losses of around 80 percent. RBS, which has settled similar cases with four other investor groups, raised its offer to 82 pence per share, or around 200 million pounds ($258 million), from about 43 pence, the day before the case was due to go to trial two weeks ago. The final offer remains a fraction of the 200 to 230 pence per share that shareholders paid for RBS shares in 2008 and denies investors the prospect of seeing Goodwin cross-examined in court. Goodwin became a symbol of banker recklessness and greed during the credit crisis. But lawyers have said the case could have dragged on for years before a court established that RBS was liable for investor losses and quantified any damages. RBS has already offered around 900 million pounds in other settlements so far to avoid a costly and potentially embarrassing lawsuit. RBS investors, including thousands of current and former RBS employees, had alleged the bank's former executives deliberately hid its over-stretched finances and failed to disclose that the regulator had ordered it to raise cash when asking investors to stump up a then-record 12 billion pounds. Just months later, the government was forced to step in with a record 45.8 billion pound bank bailout. Stephen Allen, a 67-year-old RBS shareholder from the town of Sandy in eastern England, had hoped a trial would  serve as a warning shot across the barrels that no one is beyond the reach of the law .   As far as I'm concerned the money is a factor, but it isn't the only factor,  he told Reuters.

The outburst of discontent in India's heartland farming states of Madhya Pradesh and neighboring Maharashtra poses a challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has promised to double farmers' incomes over the next five years. The farmers were shot during a protest in the central city of Mandsaur. The spokesman of one farming union said police had fired on the protesters.  Police started firing to disperse the crowd. Farmers were not carrying weapons,  said Gajendra Tokas of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, or National Farm Workers' Union, which has called a state-wide strike on Wednesday.  The state's home minister, Bhupendra Singh, said police had not shot at the protesters, adding:  Anti-social elements in the crowd fired bullets.    Singh ordered an investigation into the deaths.  We have asked for details - how the firing started, how many people were killed,  he told CNN News 18. State police said they could not confirm the toll. Farmers last week started a strike in the state and in western Maharashtra, dumping vegetables and milk on the roads to demand billions of dollars in debt forgiveness and better prices for produce. Farmers blocked highways in both states, which are ruled by  Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), preventing delivery trucks from reaching city markets. Fresh produce prices have more than doubled in cities such as India's financial center of Mumbai, which is the capital of Maharashtra, forcing authorities to provide police protection for vehicles carrying milk and vegetables. In Madhya Pradesh, farmers burned vehicles on Monday night and Tuesday morning, said a police official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the record.  The farmers have become violent over the last two days,  he added.  Some farm leaders called off their action after the states' chief ministers said they would consider their demands, but others have stepped up efforts to block roads and damage public transport. Maharashtra will waive the debts of distressed farmers before Oct. 31, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Tuesday. It would cost the state 305 billion rupees ($4.7 billion) to write off debt owed by about 3.2 million farmers. Two-thirds of India's population of 1.3 billion depend on farming for their livelihood, but the sector accounts for just 14 percent of gross domestic product, reflecting a growing divide between the countryside and increasingly well-off cities.

This year, a community food bank and kitchen in London wants to use the holy month to highlight the issue of both food shortages and food waste in Britain. The food bank - Sufra NW London - hosted an interfaith  iftar  meal, inviting Jewish and Christian faith leaders to join around 100 people from the local community in a three-course dinner, made entirely from food waste.  People come to us in absolute crisis,  said Mohammed Sadiq Mamdani, founder and director of Sufra.  For many people it's the last resort when they come to Sufra, we want to transform that into a new journey, a new opportunity.   The number of people using Britain's food banks, which provide emergency food supplies to poor families in need, rose in 2016 amid government austerity cuts. Last year Sufra supported more than 3,700 people, sourcing unused but edible food from large supermarkets as well as local bakers and through personal donations. According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), food waste includes any item spoiled or squandered along the supply chain before it is consumed, ranging from browning bananas to misshaped vegetables or perishable baked goods.  Behind the food bank, facing a social housing estate, is an  edible garden,  a recently cleared fly-tipping site that now boasts a chicken coop, greenhouse, teepee tent where children take horticulture classes, and rows of vegetables and herbs including mint - which features in the evening's pea and mint soup starter. An Act of Faith As the call to prayer signalled the setting of the sun around 9 pm, dates and water were passed around before the meal as another day of fasting was completed.  It's a bit of a shock ... that people in our midst still go hungry but that's the reality we have at the moment, whereby there is plenty and enough for all but because it's not well distributed, some go without,  said Reverend Leao Neto from the local Methodist church who addressed the crowd. Sharing food is a tradition found across faiths, said Rabbi Frank Dabba Smith.   I think it's sad that we need food banks,  he said.  I think it's a real indictment of capitalism as we practice it, there's plenty of food and resources but I'm afraid it's not equitably shared.  About a third of food produced each year is never eaten either because it is spoiled after harvest and during transportation, or thrown away by shops and consumers, according to FAO. Discarded food ends up in landfill where it rots, releasing harmful greenhouse gasses, while the water, energy and fuel needed to grow, store and transport it is wasted.  Sufra runs with the help of 96 volunteers and a handful weave between children and grandmothers serving chocolate meringue roulade made with ingredients from Thorntons chocolatier and fresh fruit donated by Marks & Spencer for dessert.  It's fun,  said 17-year-old Fatima Khawaja, who is responsible for plating and serving food to guests.  You get to know people from the community, it's just really nice.  Another volunteer, Anthony Spencer, 18, started helping out over a year ago and said it was his first time attending a Ramadan meal. His tasks normally range from washing up to taking part in supermarket collections twice a week, collecting food that stores would otherwise throw away.   Everyone gets along, we all treat each other like family,  he said.  Waste Not, Want Not In Britain an estimated 7 million tonnes of food and drink are thrown away from homes each year, costing an average household around 470 pounds a year, according to the Food Standards Agency, a government body.  Some EU countries, including France and Italy, have already adopted national measures to fight food waste. Britain still has among the lowest levels of food redistribution, a system where out-of-date but edible food is redistributed to people in need via charities and food banks.  Many faiths have a tradition of fasting and abstention and campaigns urging Muslims to consider how food is grown, eaten and disposed of are underway from the Gulf to Malaysia.   We want to ensure we can stand together as a community and combat food poverty on our doorstep,  Mamdani said.       Reporting by Adela Suliman; editing by Ros Russell.

The outburst of discontent in India's heartland farming states of Madhya Pradesh and neighboring Maharashtra poses a challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has promised to double farmers' incomes over the next five years. The farmers were shot during a protest in the central city of Mandsaur. The spokesman of one farming union said police had fired on the protesters.  Police started firing to disperse the crowd. Farmers were not carrying weapons,  said Gajendra Tokas of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, or National Farm Workers' Union, which has called a state-wide strike on Wednesday.  The state's home minister, Bhupendra Singh, said police had not shot at the protesters, adding:  Anti-social elements in the crowd fired bullets.    Singh ordered an investigation into the deaths.  We have asked for details - how the firing started, how many people were killed,  he told CNN News 18. State police said they could not confirm the toll. Farmers last week started a strike in the state and in western Maharashtra, dumping vegetables and milk on the roads to demand billions of dollars in debt forgiveness and better prices for produce. Farmers blocked highways in both states, which are ruled by  Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), preventing delivery trucks from reaching city markets. Fresh produce prices have more than doubled in cities such as India's financial center of Mumbai, which is the capital of Maharashtra, forcing authorities to provide police protection for vehicles carrying milk and vegetables. In Madhya Pradesh, farmers burned vehicles on Monday night and Tuesday morning, said a police official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the record.  The farmers have become violent over the last two days,  he added.  Some farm leaders called off their action after the states' chief ministers said they would consider their demands, but others have stepped up efforts to block roads and damage public transport. Maharashtra will waive the debts of distressed farmers before Oct. 31, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Tuesday. It would cost the state 305 billion rupees ($4.7 billion) to write off debt owed by about 3.2 million farmers. Two-thirds of India's population of 1.3 billion depend on farming for their livelihood, but the sector accounts for just 14 percent of gross domestic product, reflecting a growing divide between the countryside and increasingly well-off cities.

Much of the land around the reserve has been cleared of trees. Grazing land for cattle now stretches as far as the eye can see from the highway, destroying what used to be the mighty Amazon rainforest.  Thirty years ago, this was all untouched forest,  said Cosme da Silva, a local activist with the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) in Boca do Acre, in the southwest corner of Amazonas State.  Today all of this has been taken over by 'grileiros' (land grabbers) who destroyed it to raise cattle,  Silva told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from the passenger seat of a 4x4 truck driving past deforested land and into the reserve. As politicians plan a radical shift in how land for Brazil's 900,000 aboriginal people is demarcated, environmentalists say places like Reserve 124, where territory is formally owned by indigenous communities, represent the best chance to save endangered forests. [nL8N1IA5LI]  I am certain we are better at preserving the forests than other nearby communities,  said Chief Geraldo Apurina, standing on the porch of his hand-built home inside the reserve, as chickens pecked for scraps in his shaded yard. Harvest Without Harm The Apurina indigenous community received formal ownership of the 450 sq km (175 sq mile) of land in 1988 when Brazil emerged from a military dictatorship and signed a new constitution guaranteeing indigenous rights. Prior to demarcation, residents constantly faced violence from ranchers and farmers who wanted the land, said Maria Jose Apurina, 40, a mother of four and the chief's wife.   I've seen blood spilled (for this),  she said, sitting in her wooden home.  But now that we have the land it's better for our children... this is our place.  Reserve residents, who number around 800, make a living fishing and hunting on the land and harvesting nuts and acai berries which grow there naturally, said Apurina, 57.       We only harvest the nuts – we don't harm the trees,  he said - a claim backed up by research. Forest in the Amazon where indigenous communities formally own their land is much better protected than similar non-demarcated areas, according to a study by American scientists in Peru's rainforest published in April, backing the findings of two previous studies. [nL5N1H66IT] In Brazil's Amazon, an area larger than Germany has been deforested since 1988, according to government data. After years of declines, the rate of deforestation shot up by 29 percent last year compared to 2015, according to Brazil's National Space Research Institute (INPE). [nL5N1HB631] At this rate, environmentalists say the government will not be able to meet its goal of net zero deforestation in the Amazon by 2030. Forests controlled by indigenous people, in contrast, are among the best protected in Brazil, Luciano Evaristo, a senior official with the Brazilian government's environmental enforcement agency (IBAMA), told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. And demarcating land for indigenous communities is among the cheapest strategies for protecting the Amazon, he said. Brazilian indigenous chief Geraldo Apurina, 57, conducts an interview on inside of Indigenous Reserve 124 in Amazonas State, Brazil on May 25, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Chris Arsenault'Indians Should Decide' But formal plans to allocate new lands for indigenous people have been on hold for months and indigenous leaders are concerned that political moves will put an end to their claims. Lawmakers are planning a major transformation in Brazil's National Indian Foundation (FUNAI), the government agency that has sought to protect tribes by guaranteeing their land so they can preserve their cultures. [nL8N1I74Q5] The body is ineffective, beholden to  external interests  and makes its land demarcation decisions based on flawed data, according to a report on FUNAI's future from lawmakers and published in May. [nL2N1II0OT] FUNAI's budget has been cut by more than 40 percent in the past year.  The organization is outdated, say rural lawmakers, who have proposed changes in how it demarcates land, including opening indigenous reserves to mining companies.  There are Indians who want to become miners and producers, and they should have the freedom to decide for themselves,  Congressman Nilson Leitao, the report's author and a leading figure in Brazil's rural lobby said in May. Slideshow (3 Images) FUNAI has been over-protective and paternalistic... The Indians could be living on a big mine while their people die of hunger,  he said of communities often steeped in poverty. Waiting for Land Francisco da Silva de Araujo, 56, is an indigenous leader from the community of Valparaiso, whose ancestral land in the Amazon basin has not been formally demarcated.  He said proposed changes at FUNAI could spell the end to his peoples' hope of owning their own land, hurting Amazon conservation efforts in the process.  We have been fighting to have our land demarcated since 1991,  Araujo said following a meeting with FUNAI officials in Amazonas State about his tribe's long-standing claim.  We are very worried about these changes at FUNAI.  His community has been facing regular incursions from outsiders who have been coming to cut down trees, Araujo said.  Without formal land rights, there isn't much the two dozen extended families in his community can do to protect the forest.  Grileiros have invaded the area,  Araujo said. In one case, farmers armed with scythes threatened indigenous residents. Wagner Gallo, a local FUNAI official in Amazonas State, said budget cuts and proposed political changes have hurt the agency's ability to help people like Chief Araujo. Even before the latest budget cuts, the organization was struggling, the government official said. In the region around Boca do Acre it has laid off about 15 percent of staff.  The numbers show that demarcating land for the indigenous is the best way to protect the forest,  Gallo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation following a meeting with Araujo and other indigenous leaders.  The communities themselves often protect the forest – when someone invades, they report it,  Gallo said.  But there are economic interests eyeing indigenous land.

Comey, who was fired by President Donald Trump in May, will be grilled by the Senate Intelligence Committee on whether Trump tried to get him to back off an investigation into alleged ties between the president's 2016 campaign and Russia. British Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labour Party ahead of the general election has narrowed to just 1 percentage point, according to a poll conducted on Friday and Saturday before the latest attacks in London. Other opinion polls in recent days have indicated bigger leads for the Conservatives, some as high as 11 and 12 points. ECB policymakers are set to take a more benign view of the economy when they meet on Thursday and will even discuss dropping some of their pledges to ramp up stimulus if needed, sources told Reuters.

The FBI assistant legal attache attended a court martial on Tuesday, it said in a statement, adding he would consult local authorities about helping to investigate and prosecute the case.  The murder and rape occurred during an attack on the Terrain Hotel in Juba on July 11, 2016 as President Salva Kiir's troops won a three-day battle in the capital against opposition forces loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar. The attack, one of the worst on aid workers in South Sudan's civil war, lasted for several hours. A South Sudanese aid worker was killed and at least five women, including foreigners, were raped during the attack.  Following the attack by SPLA forces on the Terrain Hotel Compound ... which included an assault on U.S. citizens, the U.S. government asked the government of ... South Sudan to permit the FBI to assist in the investigation and the prosecution,  the U.S. Embassy in Juba said in a statement.  The Minister of Justice subsequently extended an invitation to the FBI to provide forensic assistance.      At the hearing on Tuesday, the judge adjourned the trial for two weeks after the army removed Abubaker Mohammed, its chief prosecutor, over the weekend.  Mohammed told Reuters he had been assigned to a different mission but gave no further details.  He had previously said 18 soldiers and three civilians would face charges, but only 12 suspects were present at Tuesday's hearing. It was unclear where the other nine suspects were. Rights groups have questioned the trial's fairness because it is being held in a military court not easily accessible to witnesses or the public.  The courts are staffed by military personnel who are within the hierarchy of the military and therefore the independence of this military courts is questionable,  Amnesty International's Elizabeth Deng told Reuters.  Deng also raised concern over a lack of formal charges even though suspects were arrested last year. The South Sudan Human Rights Observatory has also criticized the trial as a  sham  and called for an independent, international investigation into all crimes of sexual violence. U.S. congressman Chris Smith, who raised the issue of the trial with Kiir in a trip to Juba last week, said in a statement that their ambassador to South Sudan, Molly Phee, told him the trial  became a reality  when the government learned of his impending visit.

The speaker of the Moldovan parliament, an ally of Prime Minister Pavel Filip, said the ruling coalition would take on board some of the technical findings, but took issue with others, saying the experts had overstepped their remit. The prime minister and his allies had been seeking to change the voting system in time for a parliamentary election next year, when his party will be in a tough fight with pro-Moscow rivals, led by President Igor Dodon, who reject closer integration with Europe. The experts' opinion was commissioned by the Venice Commission, a body which rules on rights and democracy disputes in Europe and whose decisions member states -- which include Moldova -- commit to respecting. Among the findings, the experts said there was a risk that the proposed new electoral system would be susceptible to undue influence by political or business interests.  Moldova is one of several former Soviet states, also including Ukraine and Georgia, which are the subject of a tug of war for influence between Russia and the West. Moldova has a trade pact with the European Union and its government says it wants even closer integration, while Dodon, a frequent visitor to Russia, has said Moldova should focus instead on building ties with Moscow. At the moment, Moldova elects its parliament under a proportional representation system. The Democratic Party, to which the prime minister belongs, wants a mixed system, with some lawmakers elected, as now, on party lists, and others running in first-past-the-post constituency races. Supporters of the change say having legislators represent particular constituencies would enhance the link between parliament and voters. Opponents say it is an attempt to skew the electoral system in favor of the Democratic Party. Significant Concerns The Venice Commission experts concluded that the proposed changes raised significant concerns, according to an unpublished document obtained by Reuters.  Those include the risk that constituency members of parliament would be vulnerable to being influenced by business interests, and that the central election commission could be subject to political influence when implementing the proposed reform, according to the document.  In light of these concerns, and in view of limited meaningful consultation and underlying consensus needed to reform the electoral system, such a fundamental change under the current political context in Moldova seems inappropriate,  the document said. The conclusion is contained in a draft opinion submitted by the experts to the Venice Commission. A plenary session of the Commission will meet on June 16 and consider whether to adopt the experts' opinion. Panos Kakaviatos, a spokesman for the Council of Europe, the pan-European rights body to which the Venice Commission is affiliated, said the council cannot comment on leaked documents.  In an interview with Reuters, Andrian Candu, the speaker of the Moldovan parliament and a Democratic Party member, said he disagreed with the experts' conclusions, but would work with the Venice Commission on its technical recommendations.  It's for us to work with the Venice Commission, with our international partners, in order to achieve a consensus between us to move for electoral change,  Candu said. He said Moldova's ruling coalition would welcome legal arguments and technical expertise from the Commission so that the legislation on changing the electoral system can be improved,  but not to interfere in what we consider to be the sovereign choice of the country . Candu said some of the Commission's recommendations went beyond its remit. In those cases, he said,  this is something that we will either disregard or we will work with the Venice Commission in a way that they change their mind .

The bank's nine-member monetary policy committee, known as Copom, decided last week to lower its benchmark Selic rate by 100 basis points to 10.25 percent. But it added in a statement then that it considered it appropriate to dial down the pace of monetary easing going forward.  (The committee members) highlighted the necessity to offer guidance at this moment and give elements to reduce uncertainty and the scope of possibilities for the future path of monetary policy,  the bank said in the minutes. Policymakers judged it appropriate to give more clarity about their next decision as they saw less certainty regarding progress of Temer's proposals to cut public spending, such as an overhaul of social security rules. The reform agenda is fundamental to cut inflation in the long term, the minutes said. The minutes did not make specific references to the corruption investigation against Temer. He has resisted pressure to resign amid accusations he took bribes from the billionaire owners of the world's largest meatpacker JBS SA. Temer has denied the allegations. Legal experts and some of Temer's political allies said his determination to fight corruption accusations could prolong a political crisis for months. That could halt congressional passage of the reform measures, including moves to ease labor regulations and raise the pension age. A delay or further watering down of Temer's reform agenda, could hit business and consumer confidence and hamper efforts to close a fiscal deficit that soared past 10 percent of the gross domestic product last year. Traders have interpreted the bank's remarks as a signal that it would reduce the size of its rate cut to 75 or 50 basis points at its July 26 meeting, according to Thomson Reuters calculations based on futures contracts. The central bank has slashed interest rates by 400 basis points since October, as inflation plunged, to spur a recovery from the country's worst recession on record. Economists expect the bank to cut the Selic rate to 8.5 percent by year-end, according to a weekly survey.

The yen and gold also gained amid prevailing caution as an Arab rift opened up around Qatar, and ahead of testimony from the former head of the FBI, a British election and the European Central Bank's next move which all happen on Thursday. Wall Street was expected to open around 0.3 percent lower for what would be a second day of losses after both European and Asian stocks had fallen during their sessions. The dollar, meanwhile, was at its weakest since November against other top world currencies as U.S. government bond yields fell below 2.15 percent, their lowest since Donald Trump's election last year.  We've had a little bit of a cooling off in equities following the breaking of links with Qatar - a lot of people think it may force oil prices lower and remove some of the inflationary pressures,  said RBC economist Cathal Kennedy.  As those pressures ease, it pushes out the horizon for interest rate rises.  On what BayernLB analysts called  Super Thursday , British voters will also go to polls in an increasingly unpredictable general election, the European Central Bank is due to meet and later the same day and former FBI director James Comey will testify before Congress.  We have a big week or so ahead of us with the UK heading to the polls and the ECB announcing its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday and the Federal Reserve doing the same next Wednesday,  said Craig Erlam, a market analyst for OANDA securities.  Once these events pass, we may have a little more clarity and therefore see a little less caution in the markets.  The diplomatic spat in the Middle East left oil prices hovering just below $50 a barrel and this in turn hit European stocks, which tumbled across the board; the broad Euro STOXX 600 was down 0.65 percent while German stocks were down nearly 1 percent. World stocks edged further away from record highs hit last week, and the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, fell 0.2 percent. Investors instead bought gold, US Treasuries and German government bonds - some of the safest assets in the world - thrusting gold prices to six-week highs and German 10-year borrowing costs to six-week lows. U.S. Treasury yields dropped to a seven-month low of 2.129 percent at one stage. It is a move that has come despite the Federal Reserve widely expected to raise U.S. interest rates next week, but also follows a run of weaker-than-expected U.S. data. Erlam of OANDA said another area for concern is how steady sterling has been - about flat to both the dollar and the euro - potentially a sign of complacency before the election., The lead of British Prime Minister Theresa May over the opposition Labour Party ahead of Thursday's general election has narrowed to just 1 percentage point, according to a poll conducted before the attacks in London on Saturday. Other polls in recent days have found bigger leads for the Conservatives of up to 11 and 12 points. The dollar, meanwhile, touched a seven-month low ahead of Comey's testimony. Reports suggest the former FBI chief plans to talk about conversations in which U.S. President Trump allegedly pressured him to drop his investigation into former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of trade-weighted peers, fell to its lowest level since the November U.S. election. Data on Monday showing U.S. services sector activity slowing in May as new orders tumbled also hit the greenback.

Major miners have been seeking ways to maximize exploration budgets and they have also been analyzing the sustainability of their portfolios as the needs of China, the world's biggest commodity consumer, change as its economy matures.  Minmetals is rapidly becoming an important player in the global mining industry and we look forward to partnering with them,  Rio Tinto Chief Executive J-S Jacques said in a statement.  Our complementary strengths in exploration across the globe put us in the best possible position to find the metals and minerals that are essential to our modern lives.      Partnership with the  fast-growing  Minmetals would  help secure mutual global opportunities for quality resources , China Minmetals Corporation Chairman He Wenbo said. Partnerships can maximize exploration budgets that mining companies reduced in response to the commodity price crash of 2015-16. The big miners are unlikely to restore budgets to pre-slump levels as the chances of finding large new reserves diminish. More flexible arrangements can also increase the range of commodities to which miners have exposure. Rio Tinto, the world's second-biggest listed miner by market capitalization, and No. 1 BHP are particularly dependent on iron ore for revenues as a bulk commodity with high profit-margins. It is used in steel-making, but demand has faltered as China has already built much of the infrastructure it needs and can also recycle steel in circulation. Its focus is shifting toward minerals such as copper, aluminum and battery materials for electric vehicles. Following Tuesday's deal, Rio Tinto and Minmetals will work on the detail of establishing joint teams to identify targets for exploration collaboration, the statement said.

The delays will mean that Indonesia, which is one of Southeast Asia's biggest fuel importers, may have to ship in more oil products than previously planned over the next decade. Rachmad Hardadi, director of megaprojects and petrochemicals at Pertamina, told reporters the timing of the targeted completions had been pushed back to ensure that  the cost is not a burden over the same (one or two) years . He said readjustments were needed so the projects fitted with upstream acquisitions and infrastructure requirements. Hardadi said the completion of stage one of the Balikpapan project, which is to boost the refinery's capacity to 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 260,000 bpd, would be pushed back to 2020 from 2019. Stage two, aimed at improving fuel quality, would be delayed to 2021, he said. Pertamina was awaiting a green light from the board of partner Saudi Aramco for its plan to delay the completion of the $5 billion upgrade of the 348,000 bpd capacity Cilacap refinery in Central Java to 400,000 bpd to 2023 from 2021, he said. Pertamina also planned to discuss with its partner Rosneft on Wednesday delaying the completion of the new Tuban refinery project to 2023-2024 from 2021, Hardadi said. The new Tuban refinery, which will eventually be integrated with the TPPI petrochemical refinery that Pertamina took over in late 2015, will have a crude processing capacity of 300,000 bpd.

Around 20 percent of the impoverished Himalayan nation's almost 29 million people are migrant workers in the Middle East, as well as countries such as Malaysia and South Korea --generating remittances that make up a quarter of Nepal's GDP. A report by the London-based human rights group found many migrants were being forced to borrow money, with interest rates of up to 35 percent, to pay shady recruitment firms who ended up cheating them with false promises.  Unscrupulous recruiters are getting away with destroying lives – illegally charging aspiring job-seekers exorbitant fees to get jobs abroad and then abandoning them overseas when things go wrong,  James Lynch, Amnesty's Deputy Director for Global Issues, said in a statement.   It is only when they leave Nepal that migrant workers find out that they have been deceived about everything from salary to working conditions. By then it is far too late and many end up with recruitment debts that may take the rest of their working lives to pay off.  Lynch accused the Nepali authorities of investing little to check these firms and protect its overseas migrant workers - many of whom are manual laborers or domestic workers - despite their significant contribution to the country's economy.  But government officials said recruitment agencies are required to make employers in Gulf states and Malaysia pay airfare and visa fees so that migrants are not cheated. They said errant firms were penalized.         Foreign Employment Department Director Mohan Adhikari said compensation is also given to victims deceived by recruitment firms, adding that last year this totaled around $500,000.  We are doing all we can within our resources to address the problems of the migrant workers, who are victimized by recruitment companies,  Adhikari told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Amnesty's report, based on interviews with nearly 130 migrant workers and dozens of government officials, found victims paid on average $1,350 to recruitment firms for jobs abroad -- nearly double the limit permitted under Nepali law. Once overseas, the migrants often had their passports confiscated by employers and did not get contracts -- leaving them open to exploitation such as long working hours, little freedom of movement, and even forced labor.  Despite some bright ideas, a lack of political will combined with bureaucratic inertia means that businesses are still effectively free to exploit migrants,  said Lynch.     It is high time that this equation changes and migrant workers receive the protection they are entitled to.

Qatar's sovereign international bonds came under pressure, with its longest-dated paper – a bond maturing in 2046 74727PAV3= – registering the largest losses. It is now down by more than 2 cents on the dollar since the end of last week. But bond prices fell moderately across the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, said a Dubai-based portfolio manager, after Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha early on Monday, accusing it of supporting terrorism. The GCC debt market has seen a surge in foreign investment over the past year because of a surge in issuance by governments, which has improved liquidity and created a benchmark yield curve. But the Qatari crisis, the most serious threat to the existence of the GCC in years, has made some foreign institutions more cautious about the region in general, at least until they see whether the dispute can be resolved without any further escalation, fund managers said. Also, the Saudi Arabian, UAE and Bahraini central banks have not yet clarified how they want commercial banks in their countries to handle business ties with Qatar, which involve substantial cross-border lending, deposits and syndicated loans. If the commercial banks are advised to get rid of their Qatari assets in a short timeframe, or if authorities act against Qatari banking assets in their jurisdictions, that could provoke retaliation by Doha and turmoil in the Gulf banking and money markets.  There hasn't been a panic sell-off so far and the market is still seeing a two-way flow skewed toward better sellers,  said Zeina Rizq, director of fixed income asset management at Arqaam Capital in Dubai.  But things could change pretty drastically if the situation escalates or if the regional central banks ask commercial banks to sell their Qatari paper.” A senior banker at a foreign bank in Dubai said banks in the UAE had not yet been informed by the UAE central bank about what would happen to their branches and operations in Qatar.  Will a UAE bank lend to a Qatari bank that operates in Dubai or Abu Dhabi, or will it be switched out of the system? There is absolutely no clarity on this. Is this just cutting off diplomatic ties, or leading to economic sanctions against Qatari banks and companies?” Selling of GCC sovereign and corporate bonds was particularly strong on Tuesday at the long end of the yield curve, where more international investors are involved. Saudi Arabia’s bonds maturing in 2046 SA150867550= have lost a little more than 0.5 cent on the dollar since last week. Its 10-year bonds due in 2026 SA150867541= have dropped almost as much. Oman’s 2047 bonds OM157596802= were also weaker on Tuesday, down by a little more than 1 cent since last week.  If tensions remain high, the Qatar sovereign is likely to underperform its GCC peers, with the 30-year part of the curve impacted the most due to its high international ownership,” Standard Chartered said in a research report. Qatar Islamic Bank's (QISB.QA) latest $750 million sukuk issue XS161421219=TE has now dropped by about 2-1/2 cents, while Qatari property developer Ezdan Holding's (ERES.QA) 2022 sukuk issue XS159080650=TE has sunk 4.5 cents to a bid price of 95.7 cents, according to Tradeweb data. Some further downward pressure was caused by news that many UAE banks have stopped providing leverage to their clients to buy Qatari bonds, said Rizk. This means high net worth buyers could vanish from the market, banking sources told Reuters.

India is one of the largest fabric producers in the world, employing 4.5 million workers for its 2.5 million power loom factories - most of which use old technology that requires workers to manually operate them. A single person, working 12 hours or more, often tends to six to nine looms inside cramped spaces, exposing them to loud noise and injuries from the shuttle that moves at a high speed across the loom. Nearly 60 percent of the fabric and garments they produce is exported. The government's worker protection scheme, called PowerTex India, was launched in April and includes a helpline for workers and subsidies for employers to upgrade their machinery.  We have to develop the textile value chain and upgrade the technology to be more competitive,  India's textile commissioner Kavita Gupta told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  All the schemes are aimed at addressing drudgery, to better the working conditions and modernize infrastructure. If the sector has to grow, workers have to grow.  The insurance coverage - 200,000 rupees ($3,100) in the case of a natural death and 400,000 rupees for accidental death - was rolled out this month, in addition to disability compensation of 200,000 rupees. A study by India's National Institute of Occupational Health found that power loom workers are exposed to more than 100 decibels of sound - equivalent to the sound of a jackhammer or lawnmower - putting them at severe risk of hearing loss. At India's major textile hub - the port city of Surat in western Gujarat state - the local textile office has received more than 40 death compensation claims from families of power loom workers over the last two years. Researchers say workers who are unwell avoid visiting doctors because of long queues that would mean a day's wages lost. In the case of an accident or injury, they pay for treatment themselves. Many power loom workers are migrants from poor states and send home their earnings - often a family's only source of income, which disappears when these breadwinners die. Most workers die after they are no longer able to work and have returned to their villages. Gupta said workers often work long hours because of erratic power supply, an issue the government is trying to address by providing solar panels to factories. About 20,000 workers have signed up for the scheme so far. Campaigners worry enrolment could be low because employers are worried about incurring more costs per worker and therefore reluctant to disclose their staffing.  If power loom units (factories) declare them as employees, they will have to extend other social benefits as required by the law,  said Jagdish Patel, labor researcher at Gujarat-based charity People's Training and Research Centre.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain on Monday cut ties with Qatar, which denounced the move as based on lies about it supporting Islamist militants.  France wishes that the current tensions are resolved through dialogue,  the foreign ministry said in a daily online briefing. France, one of five veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council, nurtured close economic and military ties with Gulf Arab states and Egypt under the previous socialist government of former president Francois Hollande.  Business links between France and Qatar in particular deepened as Paris lured foreigners to invest in areas from sports to real estate and infrastructure. During the presidential election campaign, however, officials across the political divide said France should review ties with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, who have both been accused by of funding Islamists. Newly-elected President Emmanuel Macron promises to be demanding of Gulf Arab states. His justice minister on Tuesday said France should end tax breaks granted to Qatar, though there was no suggestion the proposed move was linked to the Arab states' row.  Macron has also indicated a willingness to improve ties with Shi'ite Iran, the arch rival of oil-exporting Sunni monarchies in the Gulf. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drain will meet his Saudi counterpart later on Tuesday as well as call the Qatari foreign minister, the ministry said. Diplomats said, however, that there was no specific French mediation effort. Le Drian is also due to meet a representative of Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince on Wednesday to discuss the issue, before heading to Egypt for a scheduled visit on Thursday.   We stand beside the countries in the region in the necessary intensification of the fight against terrorist groups, their supporters and financing,  the ministry said when asked if  Paris would review its ties to Doha in light of the accusations that it supports Islamist groups.

Boko Haram militants have displaced more than two million people in northeastern Nigeria since 2009 and over 20,000 people have been killed in that time. Tens of thousands live in camps for displaced people guarded by government troops.  Army spokesman Sani Usman said the military had  noted with great concern growing allegations of misconduct  by soldiers on security duty at a camp in Bama, a town in Borno state.  He said the allegations, which he did not describe in detail, were so far unsubstantiated but the chief of army staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Yusufu Buratai, had ordered an investigation. Usman said Nigeria had no tolerance for abuses by army officers and soldiers, and anyone found culpable would be   severely dealt with .  It is not the first time allegations of abuse by soldiers guarding refugee camps from Boko Haram have surfaced.  Last year Human Rights Watch said it had uncovered 43 cases of sexual abuse, including rape and exploitation, by security officers at camps in the northeast. Boko Haram held a swathe of territory in the northeast around the size of Belgium as of early 2015 but has since been pushed out of most of it by Nigerian troops backed by soldiers from neighboring countries. The jihadists continue to carry out suicide bomb attacks and armed raids in northeastern Nigeria as well as in neighboring Cameroon and Niger.

Qatar's sovereign international bonds came under pressure, with its longest-dated paper – a bond maturing in 2046 74727PAV3= – registering the largest losses. It is now down by more than 2 cents on the dollar since the end of last week. But bond prices fell moderately across the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, said a Dubai-based portfolio manager, after Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha early on Monday, accusing it of supporting terrorism. The GCC debt market has seen a surge in foreign investment over the past year because of a surge in issuance by governments, which has improved liquidity and created a benchmark yield curve. But the Qatari crisis, the most serious threat to the existence of the GCC in years, has made some foreign institutions more cautious about the region in general, at least until they see whether the dispute can be resolved without any further escalation, fund managers said. Also, the Saudi Arabian, UAE and Bahraini central banks have not yet clarified how they want commercial banks in their countries to handle business ties with Qatar, which involve substantial cross-border lending, deposits and syndicated loans. If the commercial banks are advised to get rid of their Qatari assets in a short timeframe, or if authorities act against Qatari banking assets in their jurisdictions, that could provoke retaliation by Doha and turmoil in the Gulf banking and money markets.  There hasn't been a panic sell-off so far and the market is still seeing a two-way flow skewed toward better sellers,  said Zeina Rizq, director of fixed income asset management at Arqaam Capital in Dubai.  But things could change pretty drastically if the situation escalates or if the regional central banks ask commercial banks to sell their Qatari paper.” A senior banker at a foreign bank in Dubai said banks in the UAE had not yet been informed by the UAE central bank about what would happen to their branches and operations in Qatar.  Will a UAE bank lend to a Qatari bank that operates in Dubai or Abu Dhabi, or will it be switched out of the system? There is absolutely no clarity on this. Is this just cutting off diplomatic ties, or leading to economic sanctions against Qatari banks and companies?” Selling of GCC sovereign and corporate bonds was particularly strong on Tuesday at the long end of the yield curve, where more international investors are involved. Saudi Arabia’s bonds maturing in 2046 SA150867550= have lost a little more than 0.5 cent on the dollar since last week. Its 10-year bonds due in 2026 SA150867541= have dropped almost as much. Oman’s 2047 bonds OM157596802= were also weaker on Tuesday, down by a little more than 1 cent since last week.  If tensions remain high, the Qatar sovereign is likely to underperform its GCC peers, with the 30-year part of the curve impacted the most due to its high international ownership,” Standard Chartered said in a research report. Qatar Islamic Bank's (QISB.QA) latest $750 million sukuk issue XS161421219=TE has now dropped by about 2-1/2 cents, while Qatari property developer Ezdan Holding's (ERES.QA) 2022 sukuk issue XS159080650=TE has sunk 4.5 cents to a bid price of 95.7 cents, according to Tradeweb data. Some further downward pressure was caused by news that many UAE banks have stopped providing leverage to their clients to buy Qatari bonds, said Rizk. This means high net worth buyers could vanish from the market, banking sources told Reuters.

Salvatore  Toto  Riina, from the Sicilian hill town of Corleone made famous in The Godfather movies, was jailed in 1993. Known for his exceptional brutality, he was for years the Sicilian Mafia's  Boss of all Bosses . Riina declared a  war against the state  and ordered the killings of magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992. Both were blown up by bombs in attacks that left nine others dead. Responding to a request by Riina's lawyers, Italy highest court ruled late on Monday he had a right to  die with dignity  under house arrest like any other terminally ill prisoner. He is believed to have cancer, heart problems and Parkinson's disease. The final decision rests with a parole board in the northern  city of Bologna, near Parma, where Riina, 86, is being held. Last year it dismissed a petition for his release and it was unclear when it would review its decision following the high court's ruling. FILE PHOTO: Sicilian Mafia boss Toto Riina poses for a police mugshot in this 1993 handout picture. Polizia Di Stato/Handout viaFile Photo The court should have remembered that the person before them is same one who blew to bits servants of the state and ordered that a little boy be dissolved in acid,  said Salvatore Borsellino, brother of the slain magistrate.  Borsellino, who made the comment in Corriere della Sera newspaper, was referring to 13-year-old Giuseppe Di Matteo. He  was strangled and his body dissolved in acid in 1996 to punish his father, an ex-member of the Mafia who collaborated with police. Leaders across the political spectrum agreed Riina should spend his final days in prison.  I am speechless,  said Matteo Salvini, head of the right-wing Northern League.   The dozens of victims who should weigh on his conscience and were brutally killed, including women and children, should have had the right to die with dignity,  he said.  We will not allow Riina to return to Corleone,  said Carmelo Miceli, head of the center-left Democratic Party in the Sicilian capital, Palermo.

Now, he blasts rapper Kendrick Lamar while harvesting crops from his own urban farm out of a shipping container in a Brooklyn parking lot. The Harvard graduate is one of 10  entrepreneurial farmers  selected by Square Roots, an indoor urban farming company, to grow kale, mini-head lettuce and other crops locally in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. For 12 months, farmers each get a 320-square-foot steel shipping container where they control the climate of their own farm. Under pink LED lights, they grow GMO-free greens all year round.  Groszyk, who personally makes all the deliveries to his 45 customers, said he chooses certain crops based on customer feedback and grows new crops based on special requests.  Literally the first day we were here, they were lowering these shipping containers with a crane off the back of a truck,  said Groszyk.  By the next week, we were already planting seeds.  Tobias Peggs launched Square Roots with Kimbal Musk, the brother of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk, in November, producing roughly 500 pounds of greens every week for hundreds of customers.  If we can come up with a solution that works for New York, then as the rest of the world increasingly looks like New York, we'll be ready to scale everywhere,  said Peggs.  In exchange for providing the farms and the year-long program, which includes support on topics like business development, branding, sales and finance, Square Roots shares 30 percent of the revenue with the farmers. Peggs estimates that farmers take home between $30,000 and $40,000 total by the end of the year. Farmer Erik Groszyk holds a rack of Tuscan Kale growing inside his hydroponic climate controlled farm, one of 10 repurposed 320-square-foot metal shipping containers where entrepreneur farmers enrolled in the  Square Roots  farming program are growing and selling a variety of greens in the parking lot of a former Pfizer factory in the Brooklyn Borough of New York City.Mike SegarThe farmers cover the operating expenses of their container farm, such as water, electricity and seeds and pay rent, costing them roughly $1,500 per month in total, according to Peggs.      An alternative path would be doing an MBA in food management, probably costing them tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars,  Peggs said, adding that he hopes farmers start companies of their own after they graduate from the program. Groszyk harvests 15 to 20 pounds of produce each week, having been trained in artificial lighting, water chemistry, nutrient balance, business development and sales. Slideshow (18 Images) It's really interesting to find out who's growing your food,  said Tieg Zaharia, 25, a software engineer at Kickstarter, while munching on a $5 bag of greens grown and packaged by Groszyk.  You're not just buying something that's shipped in from hundreds of miles away.  Nabeela Lakhani, 23, said reading  Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal  in high school inspired her to change the food system. Three nights per week, Lakhani assumes the role of resident chef at a market-to-table restaurant in lower Manhattan.  I walk up to the table and say, 'Hi guys! Sorry to interrupt, but I wanted to introduce myself. I am Chalk Point Kitchen's new urban farmer,' and they're like, 'What?'  said Lakhani, who specializes in Tuscan kale and rainbow chard.  Then I kind of just go, 'Yeah, you know, we have a shipping container in Brooklyn ... I harvest this stuff and bring it here within 24 hours of you eating it, so it's the freshest salad in New York City.'

Trump,US,USA,CLIMATECHANGE,POLL,Carbon / Emissions Markets,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Environment,Government / Politics,General News,Climate Politics,English,Major News,US Government News,Reuters Polls,Science,United States","sector":"Technology","content":" NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most Americans believe the United States should take  aggressive action  to fight climate change, but few see it as a priority issue when compared with the economy or security, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday.  The June 2-4 opinion poll suggests American voters may not penalize President Donald Trump too harshly for walking away from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, even if they would have preferred he keep the country in the deal.  The poll found 68 percent of Americans want the United States to lead global efforts to slow climate change, and 72 percent agree  that given the amount of greenhouse gases that it produces, the United States should take aggressive action to slow global warming.     Infographic ID: '2ruwdol'     Even so, Americans rank the environment near the bottom of their list of priorities for the country. Only about 4 percent of Americans believe that the  environment  is a bigger issue than healthcare, the economy, terrorism, immigration, education, crime and morality, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows.   I just kind of feel helpless about it,  Dana Anderson, 54, of Mesa, Arizona, said about climate change.  If something happens to the environment, it is what it is, right?   Anderson, who has multiple sclerosis, said that whatever Trump says about healthcare will matter to her much more than his thoughts on global temperatures.  FILE PHOTO: Protesters carry signs during the Peoples Climate March at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 29, 2017.Joshua Roberts/File PhotoThe poll was conducted after Trump announced on Thursday that the United States would abandon the landmark agreement with 195 countries to slash carbon emissions and curb global warming. The Republican president, who had previously called climate change a  hoax  despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, said he thought the pact would harm the U.S. economy without providing a tangible benefit.  The decision drew anger and condemnation from world leaders and business chiefs, many of them worried a U.S. exit would put the planet at risk and leave the United States behind in a global shift away from fossil fuels.  The poll found the U.S. public split along party lines over the move to withdraw from the global climate pact, with most Republicans supporting it and most Democrats opposing it.  Overall, 38 percent agreed with Trump's decision, 49 percent disagreed and 13 percent were undecided.  The poll also showed 50 percent of Americans believe global temperatures will rise faster as a result of the U.S. withdrawal from the climate deal, and 64 percent think U.S. relations with other countries will suffer.  The public was split over the decision's economic impact, too, with 41 percent saying it will strengthen the economy and 44 percent saying it will not.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,398 Americans, including 459 Republicans and 635 Democrats. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 percentage points for the Republicans and Democrats.

Police shot dead the gunman, Yacqub Khayre, who they said had a long criminal history, on Monday after he killed a man in the foyer of an apartment block in Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city, and held a woman hostage inside. Senior officials confirmed that Khayre had been acquitted of a plot to attack a Sydney army base in 2009 and was on parole for a violent home invasion at the time of Monday's siege.  This terrorist attack by a known criminal, a man who was only recently released on parole, is a shocking, cowardly crime,  Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told reporters in the capital, Canberra.  It is a terrorist attack and it underlines the need for us to be constantly vigilant, never to be deterred, always defiant, in the face of Islamist terrorism,  he said. Police also said they were investigating the siege as act of terrorism after Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack via its Amaq news agency. They identified Khayre as a 29-year-old Australian of Somali heritage. Amaq said the attack was launched because of Australia's membership of a U.S.-led coalition fighting against the militants in Syria and Iraq. Police said they were investigating whether Khayre had any established links with the group. Victoria state Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said earlier Khayre had arranged to meet a female escort at a block of serviced apartments in the beachside Melbourne suburb of Brighton on Monday. After shooting and killing a staff member when he arrived, Khayre then held the woman hostage for several hours before he burst out of the building and engaged police in a firefight, during which he was killed. The woman was unhurt but three police officers suffered gunshot wounds that were not life-threatening, Ashton said. Police are investigating whether Khayre tried to lure police into an ambush. Australia has not increased its terror threat level and police said they were not looking for any other suspects. A spokeswoman for Vixen Collective, an organization representing sex workers, said she did not believe escorts were specifically targeted given Islamic State had recently encouraged readers of its magazine to lure people via various means, including fake classified ads.  On Parole A bomb squad member walks outside the site of a shooting at Buckingham Serviced Apartments in Brighton, Melbourne, Australia, June 6, 2017.      AAP/Julian Smith/via REUTERSTurnbull questioned why Khayre was not behind bars after a string of offences. He first came to the attention of counter-terrorism police in 2009, when he was one of five men accused of plotting an attack on Sydney's Holsworthy Army base to kill soldiers. Three of the men were convicted, while Khayre and the fifth man were acquitted. The Victorian Supreme Court was told during that case that Khayre had been a worshipper at a Melbourne mosque and at a nearby prayer hall regarded by police as an  incubator  of extremist ideology. Prosecutors unsuccessfully argued that Khayre traveled to Somalia to obtain a fatwa, or religious ruling, in support of the Sydney plot. Slideshow (14 Images)Court documents show Khayre migrated as a child with his family to Australia through a Kenyan refugee camp. He was recognized as a refugee under Australia's humanitarian migration program and later became a citizen, police said.  There is no place in Australia for such cowardly violence,  the Somali Australian Council of Australia said in a statement. Forensic investigators were at Khayre's family home in Melbourne's suburban Roxborough Park, according to a Reuters witness. Police said they were also conducting  reassurance patrols  to calm the neighborhood.  He was jailed in 2012 over a violent burglary in Melbourne, where he was found to have repeatedly struck a woman and her father. Khayre was given a five-and-a-half year prison term, according to court documents. He was granted parole in December. Tightening of parole conditions is now likely to form a centerpiece of the next meeting between Turnbull and the state government leaders on Friday.  Siege Sparks Immigration Debate Australia, a staunch ally of the United States, has been on heightened alert for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East, or their supporters, since 2014. In December 2014, a gunman killed one hostage during a 17-hour siege at a popular Sydney cafe. Another hostage was killed by fragments of a bullet fired by police who stormed the cafe and killed the gunman. The Melbourne siege has sparked debate about immigration and travel policies.  Far-right leader Pauline Hanson said she would support a travel ban like the one U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to introduce.  (Turnbull should) look seriously at instituting a moratorium on immigration of Muslims to Australia or, at the very least, greater stringency in vetting those wishing to come to our country,  said Hanson.

After a week of violence that included the deadliest ever attack on the capital of Kabul, President Ashraf Ghani said the meeting would be more than a ceremonial effort. But with domestic political tension high, international plans in flux, and the insurgency as powerful as ever, starting any peace process may be an uphill battle. Underscoring the volatile situation, at least one rocket struck an Indian diplomatic compound in Kabul, as the delegations met a few blocks away.  Later on Tuesday, a suspected bomb outside a mosque in the  city of Herat killed seven people, police said. Ghani told the diplomats attacks in Afghanistan were part of the violence that had struck foreign cities around the world, most recently in London, where three militants drove a van into pedestrians on Saturday before attacking people with knives. Afghanistan is on the front line of a global war against such violence, he said.  We're fighting 20 transnational terrorist groups on your behalf,  Ghani said.  What we need is an agreement on regional security.  Since the international military mission declared an end to its combat mission in 2014, the Taliban have made steady gains. As of late last year, the Taliban contested or controlled about 40 percent of the country, according to U.S. government estimates, leading some observers to doubt the group would be willing to negotiate any time soon. Ghani said if the Taliban did not soon begin negotiations, he would seek new sanctions against the group as a sponsor of terrorism.  This is the last chance, take it or face the consequences,  he said. Afghanistan accuses elements in Pakistan, worried about old rival India gaining influence in Afghanistan, of providing support for militant groups like the Taliban, an accusation Pakistan denies. Foreign delegation members listen as Afghan President Ashraf Ghani delivers a speech during a peace and security cooperation conference in Kabul, Afghanistan June 6, 2017.Omar Sobhani What will it take to convince Pakistan that a stable Afghanistan helps them and helps our region,  Ghani said. More u.s. Troops? Ghani said Afghanistan had provided its preconditions for negotiations to the Taliban, but it remains unclear whether the group's leaders represented all factions. The militants have said no talks are possible until all foreign troops leave.  In the presence of invaders, peace negotiations will mean nothing,  Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters. Slideshow (4 Images) Any meeting that leads to an expansion of the invasion of Afghanistan is ineffective and Afghans will not believe in it. But if it ends the invasion and helps all foreign forces to withdraw, Afghans will welcome that.  The last significant peace effort foundered in 2015 when news broke that long-time Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar had died. The push for a new peace process comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has yet to announce his plans for the region, with at least 8,400 American troops training Afghan forces and conducting counterterrorism operations. Another 6,000 foreign troops contribute to the advising mission. U.S. military commanders have proposed sending 3,000 to 5,000 more advisers to Afghanistan in a bid to break the  stalemate . U.S. Charge d'Affaires Hugo Llorens, who is overseeing the American embassy as no new ambassador has been nominated by Trump, said the conference was a chance to send the message that  the enemies of Afghanistan cannot win .  The conference will be a visible reminder to all those who seek to harm Afghanistan that the Afghan people are never alone, especially in the wake of last week’s attack,  Llorens said in a statement. But some analysts were sceptical that the Kabul Process meetings would lead to peace talks.  Signing mutual non-interference or anti-terror support agreements won't change anything,  said Thomas Ruttig, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, noting that similar accords had been signed in the past.

Nerves over Britain's election that day showed through in a fall in sterling risk reversals, options used to hedge against or bet on falls in the pound, although the currency steadied after a 3 percent dip in the past month. A European Central Bank meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony to a Senate committee due on Thursday also drove investors into the traditional security of the yen. That took the dollar index, which measures its broader strength against a basket of currencies to the lowest since Nov. 9 of last year.  People are thinking what are the events we need to worry about, and with things all coinciding on Thursday, a bit of risk has been taken off the table,  Jeremy Stretch, a strategist with CIBC in London. The dollar fell 0.9 percent to 109.28 yen, its lowest since April 21, while the euro sank as low as 122.93 yen . With the Bank of Japan keeping 10-year Japanese bond yields pinned to zero, the dollar-yen exchange rate has been closely correlated for the past year with any shifts in U.S. 10-year Treasuries.  It is worth pointing out that the U.S. 10-year is hovering above the key technical level ... at 2.13 percent,  Rabobank analysts said in a morning note to clients.  It must hold to prevent further retracement, with the psychological level of 2 percent as the next potential target if cleared.  Treasury yields briefly dipped as low as 2.1290 as U.S. investors arrived at their desks after 1130 GMT. Comey, the FBI director fired by Donald Trump in May, will be grilled by the Senate Intelligence Committee on whether the U.S. president tried to get him to back off an investigation into alleged ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia. The threats to Trump and some of his senior advisers from the affair have added to market doubts over the administration's ability to deliver a promised boost to growth. While U.S. economic data has worsened, in Europe it has been improving and expectations have grown for some sort of change in ECB rhetoric this week. Most traders, however, say it may now be difficult for that to top the expectations priced into the euro.  Central banks seem to be very good at leaking everything before the event,  said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment with currency fund Millennium Global in London.

The 81-year-old, a retired food salesman from Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, took the national test for the first time last year but failed. So he's having another go. A father of 14 children, he has been studying five hours a day and doing his best to concentrate despite the attempts of some of his 36 grandchildren to get him to play.  I like education,  he said with pride, wearing a formal suit and tie.  There is no limit for someone to study, it does not stop at a certain age.   I want to set an example to generations - never stop learning.  Abu Ajameyah is taking the exams in a room set aside for him at a local school. A recent stroke has restricted his hand movement, making it difficult to write, so he dictates the answers to a woman aide who fills in the papers.

Abu Ajameyah gets support from his family, especially his wife, who is constantly trying to keep the grandchildren distracted while he studies. Slideshow (5 Images) My mother takes care of all my father's needs as if he was an 18-year-old high school student,  said 43-year-old Zakaria, one of Abu Ajameyah's sons.  We all encourage him and we are all very proud of him.  Zakaria said his father began school in a village near Ramla, in what is now Israel, before Israel's creation in 1948. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Abu Ajameyah's family was forced to flee, becoming refugees in the West Bank. Abu Ajameyah soon gave up school to work selling food, and only started thinking about studying again once he retired decades later. He said his aim now is to be on a par with his children and grandchildren. The exam results are due in mid-July. The family is getting ready for a celebration if he passes, but his son says he doesn't plan to go on to university.

The firm raised the funds from Gulf-based investors and hopes success at home will allow it to eventually expand to Europe and the Middle East, chief executive Junaid Wahedna said in an interview. Wahed joins a number of wealth management firms building robo-advisers, a market initially developed by startups such as Wealthfront and Betterment, to tap affluent but not necessarily very wealthy customers. The scene is now crowded, with large firms including Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Vanguard joining the fray. But Wahed hopes to claim a slice of the market by catering to Muslims seeking religiously permissible investments, which are either scarce or costly in most Western markets.  Through our research we found that they either keep their savings in cash or in real estate, there is literally no diversification. The Muslim demographic ends up losing out.  Wahed has 21 full-time staff and its plans include developing a range of exchange-traded funds. It now has registered users across 48 U.S. states, Wahedna said.  Around 10 percent of our clients are coming from existing robo-advisers, but 90 percent are not. Many are first-time investors or come from old-school advisory products.  Its initial focus will be the United States with scope for trials in Britain and the United Arab Emirates to follow, Wahedna added. Islamic investment products use filters to adhere to religious guidelines such as bans on tobacco, alcohol and gambling, in much the same way as socially responsible funds. Target Market Muslims represent a geographically-diverse but affluent population in the United States which means means they can be difficult to reach via traditional branch networks but appeal to robo-advisers, said Wahedna. The company estimates there are around four million Muslims across the U.S., with two-thirds earning more than $50,000 a year and a quarter earning more than $100,000 a year. Until now, however, their choices for sharia-compliant investments have been limited, especially compared to markets such as Malaysia and Saudi Arabia where Islamic wealth management is commonplace. Another element is cost, since robo-advisers typically use computer algorithms to create and manage portfolios made up of low-cost financial products. In the case of Wahed, its annual management fee ranges from 0.29 percent to 0.99 percent. This is comparable to other robo-advisers but lower than the fees charged by most Islamic mutual funds.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 6 (Reuters) - China's iron ore imports so far this year have been remarkably stable, especially when viewed against the backdrop of prices that surged to a 30-month high early in 2017 before falling back into a bear market. Iron ore prices in China have plunged in recent weeks, reversing more than half of a 130 percent rally from the end of 2015 to a peak in March this year. SGX iron ore, which mirrors the spot price, ended at $55.35 a tonne on Monday, down 38 percent from a high of $90.16 on March 16, but still well above $39.58 at end-2015. The decline in the main Chinese domestic benchmark futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange hasn't been quite as dramatic, with the contract closing at 435.5 yuan ($64) a tonne on Monday, down 32 percent from a peak of 636.5 yuan on Feb. 21. But this price volatility hasn't been reflected in imports by China, which buys two-thirds of global seaborne iron ore. China's seaborne imports were 85.8 million tonnes in May, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. Preliminary official data is likely to be released in the next few days, and while the ship data doesn't exactly align with customs figures, it has been an accurate pointer and is generally slightly more conservative than the customs data. If the official numbers are in line with the vessel-tracking forecast, it would represent a modest increase on April's customs imports of 82.23 million tonnes of iron ore. Using the vessel-tracking data shows a remarkable consistency of the imports so far this year, especially when calculated on a daily basis. January's daily imports were 2.72 million tonnes, February's 2.71 million, March's 2.79 million, April's 2.74 million and May's 2.77 million. Fundamentals Re-Asserting? What the data shows is that the volatility in prices wasn't related to the fundamentals of supply and demand, rather it was largely due to sentiment and investor speculation. Prices were driven higher as investors took the view that the Chinese government was working to boost spending on infrastructure and construction, main consumers of the steel that iron ore is used to produce. While there was some justification for this view, it's also the case that the market rallied too hard and too quickly, and then tried to ignore the warning signs for too long. Among the signals that the rally was overblown was the surge in China's iron ore port inventories to record highs and signs of some tightening of monetary conditions in China, a process that normally crimps commodity demand growth. The question now is whether the iron ore market in China is close to reverting to trading on supply and demand fundamentals, or whether there is still froth to come out of prices. The consensus of analysts certainly appears to be that the market is close to trading on fundamentals, with a Reuters survey showing the median expectation is for prices to stay close to current levels over the rest of 2017. The median forecast for the spot price of 62 percent iron ore on a cost and freight basis into China was $62 a tonne for the third quarter and $58 a tonne for the fourth. These forecasts are slightly higher than the current spot price, but generally fit well with a  steady-as-she-goes  scenario for Chinese iron ore imports. The price forecast seems to recognise that China's demand for imported iron ore is growing at a modest and consistent pace.

Krisha,  a 2015 film about addiction that drew from the writer-director's personal life, went on to be one of the best reviewed films of the year and won several awards. Now Shults, 27, appears to have done it again with a horror and psychological thriller, prompted by a deeply personal experience, that has scored glowing reviews.  It Comes at Night,  out in U.S. movie theaters on Friday, revolves around a family of three, led by dad Paul (Joel Edgerton), that is trying to survive in a plague-infested North America. The film starts with a shocking death and develops further into unease and paranoia when another family of three turns up at the rustic, remote home asking for refuge. Paul begrudgingly agrees.  Shults said the impetus for what he calls a scary, emotional and non-conventional horror film, came from his own father's death.  The opening scene of the movie... is what I said to my dad on his deathbed, and he was full of fear and regret and he didn't want to let go.  It was a traumatic thing that changed my life and two months after that I wrote this script and it like spewed out of me in three days... I was clearly grappling with the emotions that were going on in my head and applying that to this fictional narrative,  he said. Shults said much of the character of teen son Travis, who has nightmares, is also based on himself.  I have trouble sleeping at night. I'm really a night owl and night is when my brain is really active and it's when everyone else is asleep and you have to confront your own thoughts in a world that's quiet.  Despite the glowing reviews, one person who has not watched the finished film is Shults himself.  We did a small test screening with a way rougher cut a while back and I had a few drinks and I broke down sobbing at the end of it uncontrollably, which I think was due to the fact of the personal nature of the movie but also just how exhausted I was from working and a few drinks,  he said.  I haven't watched it since.  Reporting by Reuters Television; Editing by Dan Grebler","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/film-itcomesatnight-idUSL1N1IZ1H8"},

The Pakistani passengers were supposed to fly to Saudi Arabia via Doha to perform Umrah, a religious ritual, at Mecca. “There are two options for PIA. Either take them from Doha to Jeddah, and for that we will be needing Saudi government permission. Or the second is to bring them back to Pakistan and take them to Saudi Arabia,” Mashhood Tajwar, spokesman for the national carrier, told Reuters. Saudi Arabia is leading a clampdown on Qatar, accusing the tiny emirate of supporting pro-Iranian Islamist militants. Air travel across the Gulf and beyond faces major disruption following Monday’s move by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain to sever ties with Qatar. Tajwar said the number of stranded Pakistani passengers was not clear because they were customers of Qatar Airways, but PIA was in contact with the Pakistani embassy in Doha to get details. Saudi Arabia on Monday banned Qatari airlines from its airspace, while Abu Dhabi's state-owned Etihad Airways and Dubai's Emirates Airline said they would suspend all flights to and from Doha from Tuesday until further notice. Qatar is home to global airline Qatar Airways and many airports in the Gulf region are major hubs for international connecting flights. Qatar's main Hamad International Airport, for example, served about 9.8 million passengers from January to March, according to its website.

Elliott's stake in Dutch chemical company Akzo Nobel was first revealed in mid-March after which it lobbied for the company to  engage  with PPG over a possible takeover. Last week, PPG dropped its bid attempt after repeated rejections from Akzo. Elliott and a number of other Akzo shareholders had tried and failed to get the Dutch company to talk to PPG. Elliott, established in 1977 by Paul Elliott Singer, has a reputation for being one of the most vocal activist shareholders globally, often becoming embroiled in public disputes with the management of companies it invests in. Singer's hedge fund has already made seven new investments in companies where it has made a public demand in the first five months of 2017, compared with 12 in total in 2016, according to data from industry tracker Activist Insight.  A stake of more than 3 percent in Akzo had put it among Elliott's top five activist positions globally. Elliott also has a large team of portfolio managers overseeing commodities, fixed-income and equity long-short investments globally. Here are Elliott's top five equity holdings by market value worldwide: Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS): - $1.78 billion - Disclosed on Oct 5, 2016 - Called for Samsung to split itself in two, setting up a holding vehicle for Samsung Electronics and listing its operating company on the Nasdaq stock exchange Arconic Inc (ARNC.N): - $1.4 billion, a 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed on March 31 - Elliott disclosed 9 percent exposure in the specialty metals company on Nov. 4, 2016 - Called for cost-cutting and new leadership, questioning the management skills of former CEO Klaus Kleinfeld BHP Billiton (BLT.L): - $1.4 billion  - Disclosed in letter from Elliott on April 10 - Called for the company to sell off its oil business and ditch its dual listing structure.

India is one of the largest fabric producers in the world, employing 4.5 million workers for its 2.5 million power loom factories - most of which use old technology that requires workers to manually operate them. A single person, working 12 hours or more, often tends to six to nine looms inside cramped spaces, exposing them to loud noise and injuries from the shuttle that moves at a high speed across the loom. Nearly 60 percent of the fabric and garments they produce is exported. The government's worker protection scheme, called PowerTex India, was launched in April and includes a helpline for workers and subsidies for employers to upgrade their machinery.  We have to develop the textile value chain and upgrade the technology to be more competitive,  India's textile commissioner Kavita Gupta told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  All the schemes are aimed at addressing drudgery, to better the working conditions and modernize infrastructure. If the sector has to grow, workers have to grow.  The insurance coverage - 200,000 rupees ($3,100) in the case of a natural death and 400,000 rupees for accidental death - was rolled out this month, in addition to disability compensation of 200,000 rupees. A study by India's National Institute of Occupational Health found that power loom workers are exposed to more than 100 decibels of sound - equivalent to the sound of a jackhammer or lawnmower - putting them at severe risk of hearing loss. At India's major textile hub - the port city of Surat in western Gujarat state - the local textile office has received more than 40 death compensation claims from families of power loom workers over the last two years. Researchers say workers who are unwell avoid visiting doctors because of long queues that would mean a day's wages lost. In the case of an accident or injury, they pay for treatment themselves. Many power loom workers are migrants from poor states and send home their earnings - often a family's only source of income, which disappears when these breadwinners die. Most workers die after they are no longer able to work and have returned to their villages. Gupta said workers often work long hours because of erratic power supply, an issue the government is trying to address by providing solar panels to factories. About 20,000 workers have signed up for the scheme so far. Campaigners worry enrolment could be low because employers are worried about incurring more costs per worker and therefore reluctant to disclose their staffing.  If power loom units (factories) declare them as employees, they will have to extend other social benefits as required by the law,  said Jagdish Patel, labor researcher at Gujarat-based charity People's Training and Research Centre.

H7 bird flu was found in the rural district of Saulnay on a farm with 4,980 ducks and pheasants, said the ministry report, which was published by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) on Tuesday. All the birds on the farm were slaughtered, the report said. Duck farmers in France's southwest, the main production region for liver pate speciality foie gras, resumed rearing last week after a six-week suspension ordered as part of measures to stamp out the more virulent H5N8 virus. France, which has the largest poultry flock in the European Union, has been one of the countries most affected by the H5N8 bird flu that has spread via wild birds across Europe since late last year.

Russia trumpeted its intention and ability to sell a debut treasury bond denominated in the Chinese currency throughout 2016. But the finance ministry has not tapped the Chinese debt market yet because it has not reached a final agreement with Beijing.  We have no plans yet to sell Russian bonds in the form of Panda bonds, that is where all the problems come from,  Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak told Reuters in an interview. Russia wanted to borrow yuan by the end of 2016, what was seen as a step toward Moscow's ambition of using Asian debt markets to compensate for its limited access to Western funding. The two sides held numerous talks on the bonds, with the finance ministry's advocating for offering its so-called OFZ bonds for Chinese investors in Moscow. The Moscow Exchange told Reuters it merely needs to  press the button  once the Russian and Chinese governments agree on the delayed sale. Seeking to limit capital outflows, Chinese authorities were not ready to let its local investors play on the Russian bond market, Storchak said. Speaking on the sidelines of an annual international economic forum in St. Petersburg, Storchak said China had instead offered Russia to raise funds via Panda bonds. Panda bonds are circulated on the China's onshore market by foreign governments and firms.  We have decided that Panda bonds are a generally available instrument, which is not really interesting and efficient from the point of view of our market development,  Storchak said.  Especially given that we could easily compensate the absence of yuan borrowing with borrowing in rubles,  he said. The finance ministry is now taking its time to study requirements of its Chinese partners, Storchak said. Eventually Russia could change its mind and issue bonds in onshore China as the market seen growing further, Storchak said.

Rupee forwards were active, with spot-next forwards ending at 152.88/93 per dollar, compared with Monday's close of 152.85/95.  Some banks bought dollars in smaller quantity. We do not see much importer demand until September. We also see state banks buying dollars when they trade around 152.80/85,  a currency dealer said, asking not to be named.  We don't know if state banks are buying for the central bank.  The rupee has been under pressure after the central bank governor last month said the bank would allow gradual depreciation of the currency. The central bank has set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year. The spot rupee, which the central bank had fixed at 152.50 since May 5, did not trade on Tuesday. Foreign investors bought a net 740 million rupees ($4.86 million) worth of government securities in the week ended May 31. They have sold a net 41.33 billion rupees worth of securities so far this year. The dull trade came as investors assessed the extent of damage to the economy from the recent floods and landslides. The country's main agricultural crops - tea and rubber - were hit by the worst torrential rains in 14 years. Damage to agricultural exports would put pressure on the rupee, currency dealers said. The hospitality and manufacturing sectors are likely to be the worst hit, analysts said. However, dealers said there was some optimism over expected inflows in the form of international assistance, which could help offset potential downward pressure on the local currency. Dealers said the aid inflows could help the rupee, but the central bank will have to tighten interest rates to curb unnecessary credit growth and inflationary pressure. The floods could hurt overall economic growth and also widen the government's budget deficit with high infrastructure spending, dealers said.

The monsoon delivers about 70 percent of India's annual rainfall, critical for the farm sector that accounts for about 15 percent of India's $2 trillion economy and employs more than half of the country's 1.3 billion people. Monthly rainfall across the country is likely to be 96 percent of its long-term average during July, and 99 percent of the average during August, both with a model error of 9 percent, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in a statement. In April, the IMD forecast this year's monsoon rains at 96 percent of the 50-year average of 89 centimetres. India's 260 million farmers depend on monsoon rains to grow crops such as rice, cane, corn, cotton and soybeans because nearly half of the country's farmland lacks irrigation. Monsoon rains lashed the Kerala coast of India's southwest last month in what was the earliest start to the rains since 2011. El Nino Impact India's forecasting systems currently indicates neutral El Nino conditions until the end of this year, the IMD said, in contrast to the outlook from other global climate centres which see a 60 percent probability of weak El Nino conditions developing during the second half of this year. El Nino, a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that typically occurs every few years and was linked to crop damage, fires and flash floods, faded in 2016. Reuters reported in May that India was likely to receive higher monsoon rainfall than previously forecast as concern over the El Nino weather pattern eased. India's monsoon is also likely to receive a boost from the Indian ocean dipole (IOD) phenomenon, also called the Indian Nino, as weak positive IOD conditions are likely to develop during the monsoon season, according to the statement. The India Meteorology Department has for the first time relied on the so-called dynamic model to improve the accuracy of one of the world's most vital weather forecasts. The new system, based on a U.S. model tweaked for India, could help India raise its farm output by nearly 15 percent, by helping farmers tweak the best time to sow, irrigate or apply fertiliser, and, if rains fail, plan state-wide measures.

Malaysia had rolled out the red carpet for Saudi Arabia's King Salman at the end of February, the first by a Saudi king to Malaysia in more than a decade. Then, the following month, Kuala Lumpur signed a defense cooperation agreement with Qatar. A source close to the Malaysian government said that the recent efforts to strengthen ties with Qatar, including a visit by the foreign minister last month, will probably now be put on the backburner.   We have more to lose by siding with Qatar,  said the source, who requested anonymity. On Monday, a half-dozen countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain, cut diplomatic ties with the energy-rich emirate, accusing it of backing Tehran and Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood. Qatar has said it does not support terrorism and the rupture was founded on  baseless fabricated claims.  Doha now faces an acute economic plight as it relies on Gulf neighbors for 80 percent of its food imports. The diplomatic clamp down on Qatar is seen as an indirect jab at Iran, and leaves non-Arab Muslims countries in an  uncomfortable position , according to James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS).  The Saudis view Iran as the foremost terrorist threat rather than the Islamic State and a lot of non-Arab Muslims countries ... would probably not agree with that,  Dorsey told Reuters. Pakistan's Official Silence Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan are predominantly Sunni-Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia. Jakarta has sometimes tried to play a mediating role when inter-Arab tensions have flared, particularly between Saudi Arabia and predominantly Shi'ite Muslim Iran. Jakarta's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi received a phone call from Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Monday who wanted to discuss the rift, Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir said. Indonesia has called for reconciliation and dialogue in the latest diplomatic clash.  The dilemmas are particularly acute for nuclear-armed Pakistan, which has the world's sixth-largest army and the largest military in the Muslim world.  Sunni-majority Pakistan maintains deep links with the establishment in Riyadh, which provided Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif with political asylum after he was ousted in a 1999 military coup. But with a large Shi'ite minority and a shared western border with Iran, Pakistan has a lot to lose from rising sectarian tensions. In 2015, Pakistan declined a Saudi call to join a Riyadh-led military intervention in Yemen to fight Iranian-allied insurgents. Pakistan has maintained official silence about the latest rift in the Arab world, loathe to be seen taking sides between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Pakistan also has close ties with Qatar itself, including a 15-year agreement signed last year to import up to 3.75 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year from the emirate, a major step in filling Pakistan’s energy shortfall. “Pakistan has to act very carefully. In my opinion, there is only one option for Pakistan: to stay neutral,  said retired army Brigadier Shaukat Qadir, now an independent risk and security analyst. Islamic Military Alliance Pakistan’s recently retired army chief, General Raheel Sharif, traveled to Riyadh in April to lead the Saudi-led Islamic Military Alliance. The stated mission of the multinational alliance is to fight terrorism but it is increasingly seen as anti-Iran.  “There are rumors flying around that Raheel Sharif is pulling out of the Saudi-led military alliance. I hope they are true and he comes back soon,” said Qadir. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in January 2016 visited both Riyadh and Tehran along with Shariff, who was then the army chief, in an attempt to bridge the deepening chasm.  Relations between Malaysia and Saudi Arabia have been in the spotlight over the last two years after Saudi Arabia was dragged into a multi-billion dollar corruption scandal at Malaysian state fund lMDB, founded by Najib. Najib has denied any wrongdoing in the money-laundering case which is now being investigated by several countries including the U.S, Switzerland and Singapore. During King Salman's visit to Malaysia, Saudi oil giant Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] agreed to buy a $7 billion equity stake in Malaysian state energy firm Petronas' major refining and petrochemical project. [nL3N1GD2WX] But Qatar has also invested between $12 billion and $15 billion in Malaysia, according to media reports. RSIS' Dorsey said non-Arab Muslim countries like Malaysia would be  put on the spot  if the Saudis demand that its trade partners pick a side.  They (Malaysia) can say either I do business with you, or say I'm not going to make that choice. Then the question would be how would the Saudis or the UAE respond to that,  Dorsey said.  But we're not there yet, and there's no certainty that it will get there.

Founded in 1991, Mavi has become one of Turkey's best known fashion brands. Its clothing, which includes the  relaxed boyfriend  and  Lucy super skinny  jeans, is sold in some 35 countries. The Akarlilar family and private equity fund Turkven, which invested in Mavi in 2008, are together selling a 55 percent stake in the company at 43 to 51.6 lira a share, according to a filing with the Istanbul bourse late on Monday. That values Mavi at up to 2.56 billion lira ($723 million). Following the sale, the Akarlilar family will remain as the top shareholder, while Turkven will retain a minority stake, Chief Executive Cuneyt Yavuz told a conference call on Tuesday. The 1.4 billion lira sale, which includes a greenshoe option, has attracted attention of investors from Frankfurt, Stockholm, London and the United States, Yavuz said. Following the IPO, the company will set up a new management board, which will be chaired by Ersin Akarlilar, Yavuz said. The IPO is seen as a test of international demand for Turkish equities, after a coup attempt last year and a widespread crackdown that has seen more than 100,000 people sacked from their jobs and tens of thousands arrested. The Istanbul Stock Exchange has seen a sharp decline in listings: $14.3 million have been raised in IPOs so far this year, compared with $119.9 million in the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Bids will be collected on June 8-9 and shares are expected to begin trading on June 15.

(Reuters) - Legislative candidate Jennifer Carroll Foy's first bid for office puts her on the front lines of a Virginia statewide election being watched for early hints on how voters feel about President Donald Trump. Citing Trump's victory as a tipping point that pushed her to run, the 35-year-old public defender is one of 49 Democrats vying for Republican-held seats in the state's House of Delegates, up from 29 two years ago. The races will test whether Democrats can convert Virginians' unfavorable opinion of the Republican president in polls into votes and start clawing back some of the almost 1,000 legislative seats lost nationwide under Democratic President Barack Obama. Foy, long frustrated by her state legislature's attitude toward women's rights, is seeking a suburban Washington seat in one of the 17 Republican-controlled districts that voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton last year.  Trump was just confirmation that we're regressing and not progressing,  Foy told Reuters.  Enough is enough. If it's not me (to run), then who? If it's not now, then when?  Republicans hold a 66-34 advantage in the lower house of the Virginia legislature. Stephen Farnsworth, a political analyst at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, expects Democrats will make significant gains, especially by focusing on suburban districts. But a takeover of the chamber would require a collapse of Trump supporters, he told Reuters.  A Democratic majority in the House of Delegates is going to require a tidal wave,  Farnsworth said. The national mood has made Virginia Democrats hopeful. Opposition to Trump has galvanized hundreds of thousands of Americans and fueled huge turnouts at street protests since the  New York real estate developer's January inauguration.  A poll by the Washington Post and George Mason University's Schar School out May 22 showed 59 percent of Virginia voters disapproved of Trump's performance, compared with 36 percent who approved.  We've got two things going for us in this upcoming election, and that's going to keep energy high,  said David Toscano, Democratic leader in the Virginia House.  Voting for somebody, and also voting against somebody.

Courtesy of Jennifer Carroll Foy/Handout via REUTERSMark Walter, president of the national Republican State Leadership Committee, said his party was watching Virginia but that it was difficult to tell how voter feelings about Trump would affect the races.  In New Jersey, the only other state holding statewide elections this fall, Democrats already control both chambers. The Virginia Republican Party is unfazed by the surge of challengers. Republicans had $6.5 million for House races by the end of March, compared with the Democrats' $2.8 million, according to the most recent numbers from the state elections department.      We're doing what we've always done,  Chairman John Whitbeck said in an interview with Reuters.  Raise a lot of money, knock on a lot of doors and win a lot of seats.  Democratic legislative candidate Josh King talks about his hopes for winning a Republican-controlled seat in the Virginia House of Delegates in his campaign headquarters in Woodbridge, Virginia, United States, May 8, 2017. Picture taken May 8, 2017.Ian Simpson    Toscano, the House Democratic leader, said his party's candidates would use congressional Republicans' efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature domestic legacy, as a campaign issue, as well as Trump's brief hiring freeze for most federal workers. The party also will cite Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe's legacy of adding thousands of new jobs and billions in capital investment as a selling point, Toscano said.  McAuliffe cannot run again due to term limits, but the edge fellow Democrats have in the race to replace him is expected to give the party's House hopefuls a boost. Democrats consider the 2nd District, home to sprawling housing subdivisions, strip malls and the Quantico Marine base, one of the party's best bets to pick up a seat.     Clinton won the district by 21 points in November, helping her win a state that was once reliably Republican in presidential elections. Foy and fellow Democrat Josh King will compete in the June 13 primary. The winner will face Republican Laquan Austion in November for the seat being vacated by the Republican incumbent, who is not seeking re-election. All three candidates say voters are more concerned about local issues, such as traffic jams, education and pollution from power plant coal ash, than Trump.  Obviously, the Trump effect is in the air, but we're focusing the energy into what we can do locally,  said King, 36, a deputy sheriff who narrowly lost the 2015 election for the seat.

He said he did not expect exchanges to be at the top of the UK government's priority list in Brexit negotiations, but these businesses had been identified by other countries as being important for capital markets and job creation. It is unclear whether disruption to cross-border customer links can be avoided after Brexit, leaving banks, insurers, asset managers and exchanges based in London to consider new EU bases.  To a certain extent, the UK has taken our presence here for granted,  he told an IDX derivatives conference, and urged Britain's government to show its support, such as by maintaining low tax and stable legal regimes. Markets were based in London because of stable regulation, taxes and predictable law, but it was not clear if this would continue in future, Sprecher said. Sprecher, whose company operates a derivatives exchange in London, said he was asked by France, Germany and the Netherlands if he wanted to build up a base on the continent after Britain leaves the European Union in 2019. Rival U.S. exchange CME (CME.O) is closing its UK-based trading platform and clearing house due to poor customer demand, though it continues to offer U.S.-based products in Europe. Sprecher said the CME's decision was a  canary in the coalmine  that showed no exchange needed to be physically based in Britain. CME Group President Bryan Durkin said no UK government official had called him after the decision was announced. Government policy can impact not just where markets are based, but their  vibrancy and efficiency  as well, Durkin said. Euro Clearing The EU's executive European Commission is due this month to set out how and where euro denominated derivatives should be cleared after Brexit. The bulk of clearing is currently done in London by a London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) unit. The Futures Industry Association (FIA) said forcing a change in location would fragment markets and bump up costs. The amount of margin, or cash banks post in case a derivatives trade defaults, could nearly double from $83 billion to $160 billion, FIA Chief Executive Walt Lukken told the IDX conference.  It's important that we allow market forces to determine the appropriate location for euro clearing,  Lukken said. Nevertheless, exchanges are quietly preparing for any shift in clearing, with ICE already getting its existing Dutch clearer ready.  Brexit is going to fragment markets and will change the competitive landscape. We may see the hand of God move clients to different jurisdictions,  Sprecher said.  It feels pretty good right now in the face of Brexit to have continental European presence that is ready to accept business.  Rival Eurex Clearing (DB1Gn.DE) in Frankfurt has also said it was ready to accept volumes from London. Finbarr Hutcheson, president of ICE's benchmark unit, said if the EU forced a shift in euro clearing, the United States could retaliate by requiring dollar denominated clearing to be based in America. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has bought Bats, Europe's biggest cross-border stock exchange, based in London. CBOE Chief Executive Ed Tilly said Brexit was an opportunity and he would decide in the second half of the year whether to open a second European base inside the EU27.

The Series E round was led by existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Accel. Sapphire Ventures and Geodesic Capital invested in the firm for the first time, while Social Capital and Iconiq Capital increased their investment in the firm, according to Netskope. Beri declined comment on valuation, but said that it was a  significant  increase compared to a $75 million Series D round in 2015. He declined to say how much revenue the company brought in last year, though he said it tripled and that he expects growth to continue at that rate.  The firm, which helps large organizations monitor and secure employee use of cloud services such as Google Drive and Dropbox, has raised $231 million since it was founded in 2012.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain said on Monday they would sever all ties including transport links with Qatar, escalating past diplomatic disagreements. Within hours, the UAE barred all vessels coming to or from Qatar using its anchorage point off Fujairah, a popular location for bunkering, where vessels take on fuel of their own. Platts' move is unlikely to have a significant impact on the broader oil market because Qatar is one of the smaller producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Any disruption to Qatar's liquefied natural gas exports, an area in which it is a major world player, could hit global prices, but there is no indication so far of that happening. Al-Shaheen crude from Qatar usually loads onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, meaning flexibility of movement is critical to transporting oil out of the region.  It is typical in the Gulf to co-load VLCCs (very large crude carriers) in combinations that include crude oil from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE and Oman,  S&P; Global Platts said in a note to subscribers.  As such, restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar, including al-Shaheen,  it said. Riyadh issued a similar shipping ban. Trading sources say cargoes of al-Shaheen usually load onto VLCCs in Saudi Arabia before sailing to Asia. Trades, bids and offers for Qatar's al-Shaheen grade, a medium sour crude, have been included in Platts' assessment of its Dubai price benchmark, which underpins the vast majority of oil trades in Asia, since January 2016. The Dubai benchmark is backed by Dubai and Oman crude, Abu Dhabi's Upper Zakum and Murban grades, as well as al-Shaheen.  Qatar-loading al-Shaheen may not be nominated in the Platts Dubai Markets on Close process without mutual agreement between buyer and seller,  the company said in an emailed statement.  Since its introduction as a deliverable into the Dubai basket in January 2016, al-Shaheen has performed well. This review is to ensure that the Dubai benchmark is not negatively impacted by the current uncertainties surrounding Qatar’s relations with its Gulf neighbours.  Buyers and sellers could mutually agree to alternate loadings of al-Shaheen cargoes, but sellers should not impose this, Platts said.  If a party wants to bid up Dubai they won’t agree to any of the sellers’ request to deliver al-Shaheen, so it will definitely affect (the benchmark),” a source from an Asian refiner said. Sellers in the Platts trading window were previously allowed to deliver, without buyers’ consent, any of the five crude grades that make up the Dubai benchmark. Platts said it would continue to assess and publish independent values for other Qatari-loading crudes during the review. It added that the process would not immediately impact existing nominations for cargoes loading in June and July against trades previously reported in the Platts pricing process, known as the market-on-close. The company, a unit of S&P; Global Inc, produces a number of benchmark prices for the crude oil market, including dated Brent.

The home team has been victorious in Chicago’s last 13 games, as the Cubs have won the first four of their 10-game homestand following an 0-6 West Coast trip. The Marlins had captured seven of eight entering the series but continue to struggle on the road, where they have dropped 10 of their last 14 and are 10-16 on the season.

Retailers led by large stores including Target, Best Buy and Autozone are trying to get Republicans to abandon the tax as a piece of any sweeping tax reform. The measure would impose a tax on imports while favoring domestic production. The meetings, which will begin on Tuesday and conclude on Thursday, will include lawmakers and staff from several states including Arizona, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania, focusing on districts represented by members who have not taken a position on the tax or sit on the Ways and Means Committee. They hope to convince them to oppose the tax. The meetings are the latest effort by retailers to lobby lawmakers to not support a tax they say would increase consumer prices for imported goods. U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has remained a driving force behind the border tax proposal, arguing that economic forces will keep the tax from raising consumer prices. The future of the tax remains shaky. President Donald Trump has refused to endorse it and many Republicans in the House and Senate are opposed. Furthermore, the effort to pass tax reform has stalled. But Joshua Baca, a spokesman for the coalition opposing the tax, said they will continue to fight against it.  The fight is not done. The people who control the process are still very much in favor of the border adjustment tax,  Baca said. Emmett Kelly owns a gun store in Conroe, Texas, in the congressional district of Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, an advocate for the tax. Kelly will travel to Washington to argue tax would be devastating for gun retailers, noting that he imports about 80 percent of his inventory.  Everybody that I’ve talked to has shuttered when they heard what this border adjustment tax is going to cost,  he said. Peter Sides, owner of the Robert M. Sides Family Music Centers which has five locations in Pennsylvania and New York, said 95 percent of the instruments and accessories sold in his store are imported. A price increase will hit his more frequent customers hardest - families with children with a budding interest in music.  It all adds up – and it’s not just what happens to us, you’re asking a family to take on the chin a 15-20 percent across-the-board expense increase for anything that’s imported,  Sides said.

Groszyk, who personally makes all the deliveries to his 45 customers, said he chooses certain crops based on customer feedback and grows new crops based on special requests.  Literally the first day we were here, they were lowering these shipping containers with a crane off the back of a truck,  said Groszyk.  By the next week, we were already planting seeds.  Tobias Peggs launched Square Roots with Kimbal Musk, the brother of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk, in November, producing roughly 500 pounds of greens every week for hundreds of customers.  If we can come up with a solution that works for New York, then as the rest of the world increasingly looks like New York, we'll be ready to scale everywhere,  said Peggs.  In exchange for providing the farms and the year-long program, which includes support on topics like business development, branding, sales and finance, Square Roots shares 30 percent of the revenue with the farmers. Peggs estimates that farmers take home between $30,000 and $40,000 total by the end of the year. Farmer Erik Groszyk holds a rack of Tuscan Kale growing inside his hydroponic climate controlled farm, one of 10 repurposed 320-square-foot metal shipping containers where entrepreneur farmers enrolled in the  Square Roots  farming program are growing and selling a variety of greens in the parking lot of a former Pfizer factory in the Brooklyn Borough of New York City.Mike SegarThe farmers cover the operating expenses of their container farm, such as water, electricity and seeds and pay rent, costing them roughly $1,500 per month in total, according to Peggs.      An alternative path would be doing an MBA in food management, probably costing them tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars,  Peggs said, adding that he hopes farmers start companies of their own after they graduate from the program. Groszyk harvests 15 to 20 pounds of produce each week, having been trained in artificial lighting, water chemistry, nutrient balance, business development and sales.

You're not just buying something that's shipped in from hundreds of miles away.

Three nights per week, Lakhani assumes the role of resident chef at a market-to-table restaurant in lower Manhattan.  I walk up to the table and say, 'Hi guys! Sorry to interrupt, but I wanted to introduce myself. I am Chalk Point Kitchen's new urban farmer,' and they're like, 'What?'  said Lakhani, who specializes in Tuscan kale and rainbow chard.  Then I kind of just go, 'Yeah, you know, we have a shipping container in Brooklyn ... I harvest this stuff and bring it here within 24 hours of you eating it, so it's the freshest salad in New York City.'

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain said on Monday they would sever all ties including transport links with Qatar, escalating past diplomatic disagreements. Within hours, the UAE barred all vessels coming to or from Qatar using its anchorage point off Fujairah, a popular location for bunkering, where vessels take on fuel of their own. Platts' move is unlikely to have a significant impact on the broader oil market because Qatar is one of the smaller producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Any disruption to Qatar's liquefied natural gas exports, an area in which it is a major world player, could hit global prices, but there is no indication so far of that happening. Al-Shaheen crude from Qatar usually loads onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, meaning flexibility of movement is critical to transporting oil out of the region.   It is typical in the Gulf to co-load VLCCs (very large crude carriers) in combinations that include crude oil from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE and Oman,  S&P; Global Platts said in a note to subscribers.    As such, restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar, including al-Shaheen,  it said.  Riyadh issued a similar shipping ban. Trading sources say cargoes of al-Shaheen usually load onto VLCCs in Saudi Arabia before sailing to Asia. Trades, bids and offers for Qatar's al-Shaheen grade, a medium sour crude, have been included in Platts' assessment of its Dubai price benchmark, which underpins the vast majority of oil trades in Asia, since January 2016. The Dubai benchmark is backed by Dubai and Oman crude, Abu Dhabi's Upper Zakum and Murban grades, as well as al-Shaheen.  Qatar-loading al-Shaheen may not be nominated in the Platts Dubai Markets on Close process without mutual agreement between buyer and seller,  the company said in an emailed statement.  Since its introduction as a deliverable into the Dubai basket in January 2016, al-Shaheen has performed well. This review is to ensure that the Dubai benchmark is not negatively impacted by the current uncertainties surrounding Qatar’s relations with its Gulf neighbors.  Buyers and sellers could mutually agree to alternate loadings of al-Shaheen cargoes, but sellers should not impose this, Platts said.  If a party wants to bid up Dubai they won’t agree to any of the sellers’ request to deliver al-Shaheen, so it will definitely affect (the benchmark),” a source from an Asian refiner said. Sellers in the Platts trading window were previously allowed to deliver, without buyers’ consent, any of the five crude grades that make up the Dubai benchmark. Platts said it would continue to assess and publish independent values for other Qatari-loading crudes during the review. It added that the process would not immediately impact existing nominations for cargoes loading in June and July against trades previously reported in the Platts pricing process, known as the market-on-close. The company, a unit of S&P; Global Inc, produces a number of benchmark prices for the crude oil market, including dated Brent.

A year after the Indian government announced a scheme to assist bonded laborers - including a fivefold increase in compensation for these exploited workers - many rescues have been postponed because funding has not come through, campaigners say. The 1 million-rupee ($15,500) funds mandated for each district have not yet been created in southern India, according to Krishnan Kandasamy of the non-profit National Adivasi Solidarity Council, a network for indigenous peoples' welfare.  The fallout has been that in many instances officials have declined to act on information and rescue workers - stating they do not have funds to pay,  Kandasamy said. Across India, villagers lured by traffickers with the promise of a good job and advance payments become trapped in bondage, forced to toil in fields or brick kilns, enslaved in brothels or confined as maids to pay off debt. Under India's new regulations, in effect since May 2016, every rescued bonded laborer should be given 5,000 rupees ($78) as immediate assistance on the spot. Because rescued bonded laborers often face delays in receiving compensation, India expanded the scheme's annual budget to 470 million rupees ($7 million) from 50 million rupees.  State governments are expected to make the payments and reclaim the entire amount from us,  said Rajit Punhani, a senior official in charge of labor welfare for India's Ministry of Labour and Employment.  In many instances, we are yet to receive any demand for funds.  Nearly two weeks ago, 31 workers, including 12 children, were rescued from a brick kiln on the outskirts of Bangalore, in southern Karnataka state. The eight families, held in debt bondage at the kiln for up to eight months, were sent home to eastern Odisha state with just 1,000 rupees ($16) each - a fifth of what they are entitled to. The reason cited by officials involved in the rescue was lack of funds. Activists say 185 people have been rescued from bonded labor and trafficking in the Bangalore area since January, but most have not received compensation under the revised scheme. Kodipalaya Krishnappa, an official overseeing the bonded labor scheme in Karnataka, said the state has asked the labor department for the funds and is trying to expedite the process. More than a quarter of a million bonded laborers have received compensated since the earlier scheme was put in place in 1978, according to government data. Activists blame official indifference for the payment delays.  It is still seen as a 'poverty driven issue' or 'relic of the past'. Many miss the modern nature of the crime, which is often very violent,  said Esther Daniels of the International Justice Mission, a non-governmental organization working with governments to rescue and rehabilitate bonded laborers.

Asia's unprecedented economic growth has helped to reduce poverty, but future growth, prosperity and stability  are all under threat from the impact of a swelling list of environmental and social burdens,  according to a report released Monday by the Business and Sustainable Development Commission.   There is the opportunity to shape a safer, more prosperous world,  the report said. Asia, home to two-thirds of the world's population, is extremely vulnerable to weather-related disasters, whose frequency and intensity could worsen as a result of climate change.  Meanwhile, more than 80 percent of the region's population live in countries where inequality has risen over the past 20 years, according to the Asian Development Bank.  Pursuing strategies in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) would turn these threats into opportunities and provide  the chance to consolidate and sustain the region's regeneration , the report said.  The 17-point SDGs, launched last year, include targets on eliminating poverty, providing clean energy, creating better jobs and tackling economic inequality by 2030.  The report identified four key areas with the most significant opportunities - cities, energy and materials, food and agriculture, and health and well-being - and specific projects such as affordable housing, renewable energy, reducing food waste and sustainable aquaculture.  The $5 trillion value is conservative and more value could come from other sectors including information and communication technologies, education and consumer goods, it added.  The cost of realising these opportunities in the four key areas would likely require $1.7 trillion of annual investment, the report said.  The commission said  blended financing , where public and philanthropic bodies take on high risk and more policy-sensitive investment, could fill the funding gap.    The report follows an earlier study that identified $12 trillion in market opportunities and the creation of up to 380 million jobs globally in the same time frame. Asia accounts for more than 40 percent of these opportunities, the latest report said.  Of the $5 trillion in business opportunities in Asia, around $2.3 trillion could be found in China alone, $1.1 trillion in India, and $1.1 trillion in developing and emerging countries, the report said. The rest are in developed countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea.

Community or common lands include forests, grazing lands, water bodies and land owned by village councils. They provide food, water, fuel, fodder and livelihoods to rural communities. These lands make up more than a third of India's land area but as demand for land has risen to spur economic growth, large tracts have been reclassified by state governments for industrial use, threatening local artisans' livelihoods.  Traditionally, potters, weavers, ironsmiths, all had access to common lands for their work,  said Tarique Shafique, a social worker in Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh state, known for its silk sarees made by Muslim weavers.  Now there is less of that land, and that is hurting their work. These are people who have done this work for generations.  Many of them belong to lower-caste and minority communities who do not own land so the loss of common lands has a more debilitating effect than the acquisition of private land where compensation is paid, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Between 1980 and 2011, about 830,000 hectares (3,205 sq miles) of India's forest land were reclassified or diverted for industrial use, according to advocacy group Rights and Resources Institute. Nearly a quarter of this land was given to mining, while a fifth went to power projects as India builds infrastructure to spur growth and generate jobs for its 1.2 billion population.  Weavers and Potters  Land use is determined by the states on a case by case basis, and the law is followed in every case,  said Hukum Singh Meena, a joint secretary in the department of land resources.  In villages, dhobis, or washermen, washed clothes and hung them out to dry in 'dhobighaats' earmarked for this purpose.  Potters, weavers, ironsmiths and coppersmiths used common property resources to source water, mud and reeds, and to dry their wares.  Earlier, there used to be  tana-bana zameen , a piece of land where weavers placed their looms,  said Niti Saxena, a land rights researcher in Lucknow city in Uttar Pradesh.  That has slowly disappeared from villages, leaving them with no place to weave,  she said. In Goa, where about 70 percent of land is collectively owned and administered by a centuries-old community code, common lands are caught up in several disputes with the state. In the southern city of Chennai, popular classical singer T.M. Krishna recently made a music video appealing for the protection of common lands, sometimes also called wastelands. The 2006 Forest Rights Act and an older law to protect lands of indigenous people recognize the rights of forest dwellers and indigenous communities. But states can deny these rights or change the classification of land, particularly in resource-rich areas it deems critical for development.  Once the land is gone, it's gone,  said Shafique.   Then these workers have no choice but to give up their trade and move to the cities to work in construction.

Political uncertainty weighed on stock markets globally, and equities in the eastern states of the European Union fell in line with Western peers.     Investors also used the negative sentiment for some profit-taking.     Budapest's main index hit record highs last week and now dances around the key 35,000-point mark, and in Bucharest whose index is retreating from its highest levels since early 2008.     Budapest shed 0.6 percent by 0939 GMT even though road transport firm Waberer's International announced that it planned to raise 50 million euros ($56 million) in fresh capital in a initial public offering (IPO), and listing in Budapest.      Apart from Warsaw, Central Europe's biggest bourse, IPO's are rare in the region.      Successful IPO's were Moneta bank in Prague last year and cable and internet provider DIGI Communications N.V  in Bucharest last month.     Raiffeisen's Polish unit and debt collector GetBack consider IPOs in Warsaw.     Waberer's planned listing could make it the fifth biggest stock on the Budapest Stock Exchange and fuel foreign investors' interest in the bourse, market participants said.     Waberer's is one of the biggest road haulage companies in the EU.     It will face difficulties due to Britain's move to quit the EU, tightening regulations on the industry in Europe and a rise in administrative costs, Equilor brokerage analyst Monika Kiss told Reuters.     But it is helped by economic pick-up in Europe and in Hungary, relatively low wages in Central Europe and a decline in fuel prices.     Crude prices were slightly lower, though off intra-day lows on Tuesday, with the tension around Qatar raising questions over its agreed production quota.     The stocks of Polish oil group PKN Orlen PKN.WA> and refiner Lotos rose 2.4 percent, and 3.1 percent, respectively, keeping Warsaw's main index in the positive despite a fall in other shares.     Bucharest's index fell 1.1 percent, pulled down partly by a 7.1 percent plunge in the stocks of power grid operator Transelectrica which traded ex-dividend, has a newly appointed management and reported disappointing first-quarter results recently.     Poland's 10-year government bond yield dropped 2 basis points to 3.1655 percent ahead of a meeting of the Polish central bank on Wednesday.     The bank is likely to keep interest rates on hold until it raises them in the third quarter of 2018, a Reuters poll found last week, a quarter later than the previous sounding.

AO World's stock was the biggest percentage loser on the FTSE 250 midcap index after it reported a full-year loss, with shares falling as much as 10 percent to 130 pence, their lowest level since early July 2016. Slowing consumer confidence, rising inflation and a slowdown in the UK housing market hurt trading in the second half of 2016 and these trends have continued into the start of the new financial year, the electricals retailer said. Rising inflation and muted wage growth following Britain's vote to leave the European Union last June is forcing many UK consumers to rein in their spending. The company's operating loss for the year ended March 31 was 12 million pounds ($15.5 million) from a loss of 10.6 million pounds a year earlier, largely due to higher losses in the Netherlands and Germany. AO World, which sells everything from washing machines and fridges to vacuum cleaners and TVs, however, said it continued to grow market share across all its product ranges and markets. Group revenue for the period rose 17 percent to 701.2 million pounds, with UK revenue up by 12.7 percent and Europe revenue up 52.3 percent in constant currency.  Today's full-year results highlight the cost of expansion,  said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital. AO World raised 50 million pounds in March to support growth in its product range and European markets. The company, which rivals Dixons Carphone and Home Retail's Argos, said it saw a good start to the year in Europe and its expansion plans were on track. AO World's shares have fallen more than 60 percent since it listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2014, with the stock on course for demotion from the FTSE 250 midcap index. In February, its founder and largest shareholder John Roberts stepped down as chief executive and was succeeded by Chief Operations Officer Steve Caunce. Shares in the company were down 5.9 percent at 1017 GMT.

Delivery Hero said on Tuesday it would issue new shares worth about 450 million euros, while existing shareholders including Rocket Internet (RKET.DE) may sell up to the same amount, people close to the matter have said. Founded in Berlin in 2011, Delivery Hero has grown rapidly and now employs over 6,000 people, providing a digital platform to order meals from more than 150,000 restaurants in 40 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia. Delivery Hero wants to have a strong net cash position so it can be prepared to grow both organically and through possible further acquisitions, Chief Executive Niklas Ostberg said.  This is a big step for us and the whole European tech scene,  Ostberg told a call for journalists. The listing - expected in the coming weeks - would provide a much-needed boost to struggling German ecommerce investor Rocket Internet, which holds a 35 percent stake in Delivery Hero, making it the biggest holding in its portfolio. Rocket Internet had early success with online fashion firm Zalando (ZALG.DE), which listed in 2014, but it has not brought any other companies to market yet.  Rocket's shares have rallied in anticipation of the Delivery Hero IPO but were flat on Tuesday at 21.51 euros. South African media and e-commerce firm Naspers (NPNJn.J) took a 10 percent stake in Delivery Hero last month.

Picture taken June 2, 2017.Fabrizio BenschWell-Trodden Path There has been a wave of capital raising and consolidation in online meal delivery as Uber and Amazon push into the sector, with Delivery Hero last week buying Middle East rival Carriage. Delivery Hero will become the fourth major online food delivery firm to go public in recent years, following GrubHub (GRUB.N), Just Eat (JE.L) and Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS), which have all seen their shares soar since listing. The Delivery Hero headquarters is pictured in Berlin, Germany, June 2, 2017.Fabrizio BenschDelivery Hero narrowed its loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to 116 million euros last year from 175 million in 2015, with half of that due to increased  costs, including heavy marketing, for its Foodora unit which delivers from high-end restaurants. Ostberg said the reason the company was still loss-making, unlike rivals such as GrubHub and Just Eat, was because Delivery Hero is operating in less mature markets and investing more in marketing. Delivery Hero may use the IPO proceeds to step up marketing spending by 10-15 percent, a person close to the company said on condition of anonymity. Delivery Hero takes a commission of about 1.60 euros - or 10 or 11 percent on each average order - and slightly higher fees if it does the delivery itself, compared to figures closer to 15 percent or above for peers like Just Eat and GrubHub.  Citigroup, Goldman Sachs International and Morgan Stanley will act as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners, Delivery Hero said. UniCredit Bank AG, Berenberg, Jefferies and UBS Investment Bank have been mandated as additional joint bookrunners.

Such deals, a typical business practice in the industry, are frowned upon by competition authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, who say they block the entry of cheaper generic medicines into the market as governments grapple with rising healthcare costs. The case against Servier and five other drugmakers related to the French company's cardiovascular medicine perindopril. Servier's appeal against the fine imposed by the European Commission in 2014 comes as the EU competition enforcer recently opened another front against the sector, this time an investigation into South Africa's Aspen Pharmacare for allegedly charging excessive prices for five key cancer drugs. The case relating to perindopril was triggered by a regulatory inquiry into the sector in 2008 and 2009, which found that pay-for-delay deals were costing European consumers billions of euros.  The Commission's investigation was skewed from the beginning,  Servier lawyer Olivier de Juvigny told a panel of five judges at the General Court, Europe's second highest court, on the first day of a four-day hearing. He said public statements made by two previous competition commissioners on the case even before a decision was issued showed bias against the company, on top of legal and procedural mistakes. Commission lawyer Bernard Mongin denied prejudice against the company.  The investigation was carried out in a neutral manner,  he said, adding that it was clear that Servier wanted to block rivals' cheaper medicines.  Servier was faced with the risk of entry of generics and it set about neutralising these risks,  he said. Lobbying group the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) backed Servier, saying that the Commission should not punish legitimate settlement deals on patents simply because they include the transfer of money. Danish peer Lundbeck tried but failed to convince the EU Court of Justice (ECJ), Europe's top court, last year that its deals with five smaller rivals to delay cheaper generic copies of its blockbuster citalopram anti-depressant from entering the market were not anti-competitive.

If the dispute persists, the economic and financial implications for Qatar would be more serious, but any potential rating impact would depend on several factors, including Qatar's policy response and the maintenance of broad domestic political stability. The level of damage to the Qatari economy will depend on the duration of the dispute and the scope of measures that affect trade. Fitch assumes that the countries involved will seek to avoid a prolonged standoff with the attendant risks to Qatar's economy and regional stability. Qatar's very large sovereign net foreign asset position should allow it to manage temporary macro-economic disturbances. Qatar's exports of natural gas to the UAE via the Dolphin gas pipeline appear to be unaffected and Qatar could redirect its gas exports along international shipping routes. The wholesale closure of borders and loss of established import routes, if sustained, will see inflation spike, for example because most foodstuffs are imported from or through Saudi Arabia. Large infrastructure projects may be delayed or their costs re-assessed if the supply of construction materials from the UAE is cut off. Prolonged economic isolation would imperil Qatar's efforts to diversify away from hydrocarbons and become a regional services and manufacturing hub. Qatar's tourism, trade and hospitality sectors would suffer from a loss of visitors from the Gulf, who make up almost half of total visitors. Revenues of state-owned Qatar Airways will drop because of lower regional traffic and the need to re-route and cancel flights as a result of airspace closures. A general weakening of economic sentiment could hit the retail and real estate sectors. Domestic demand would suffer from the emigration of nationals from the countries imposing sanctions. Implications for the Qatar government's finances are unclear. Like other sectors of the economy, the government directly or indirectly imports a large part of the goods and services it needs, which could delay a return to fiscal surpluses. The government might also provide financial support to those sectors of the economy that are particularly affected. However, any cut-backs to capital spending would have a positive fiscal impact, and slowing growth in itself would have little revenue impact given the government's low tax base. None of the measures announced so far has specifically targeted Qatar's financial sector. Fitch understands that of the non-resident deposits in Qatar's commercial banks (around 25% of the total), a sizeable portion comes from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. If there were a sudden outflow of these deposits, this might require a liquidity injection from the central bank, and it could put further pressure on bank funding costs and lead to a further slowdown of credit growth. We believe that the potential political and economic implications for Qatar, and the desire of other GCC members not to completely alienate Qatar, mean that both sides will work towards a relatively swift resolution. But there is considerable uncertainty given the punitive nature of the actions announced on Monday. Tensions between Qatar and other GCC countries have surfaced in the past. In March 2014, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE withdrew their ambassadors in a dispute over Qatar's support for the Muslim Brotherhood, which lasted eight months. As we noted when we affirmed Qatar's 'AA'/Stable sovereign rating last September, sovereign net foreign assets worth over 200% of GDP mean that the sovereign credit profile is highly resilient to external shocks. As the situation evolves, our assessment will focus on effects on the sovereign's external and fiscal deficits.

They also blocked highways, preventing delivery trucks from reaching city markets. Prices of fresh produce more than doubled in cities including the state capital, Mumbai. Some farmers' leaders in Maharashtra agreed at the weekend to call off their action after Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said he would meet their demand for a waiver on farmer loans.

Mahathir, 91, served as prime minister for 22 years, earning a reputation as a no-nonsense authoritarian with little time for dissenters promoting liberal values. But he has recently emerged as a prominent critic of Prime Minister Najib Razak, a former protégé who last year became ensnared in controversy over a multi-billion dollar financial scandal at a state fund. Najib has denied any wrongdoing. Mahathir's criticism of the prime minister has endeared him to voters who in the past would have shunned both of them. Malaysiakini.com news portal, which is often accused by government supporters of favouring the opposition, found in a poll that 69.9 percent of its readers would support Mahathir as opposition candidate for prime minister. Malaysia is due to hold a general election next year. The opposition has yet to name its candidate, citing a need to avoid infighting between allied parties. Malaysia's most prominent opposition politician, Anwar Ibrahim, is in prison serving five years for a sodomy conviction that he says was politically motivated. Mahathir, who stepped down as prime minister in 2003, was not immediately available for comment. He told Reuters in an interview in March he had no desire to return as prime minister but would be willing to serve as an adviser. Malaysia's longest-serving prime minister quit the ruling United Malays National Organisation party last year in response to the graft allegations surrounding Najib. Mahathir has formed a new party and joined an opposition coalition aiming to oust Najib.  The prime minister has weathered the calls to step down and is expected to call an early election this year to capitalize on disarray within the opposition. According to the Malaysian Digital Association, which tracks top websites, Malaysiakini is Malaysia's second most popular news website, with nearly 700,000 unique visitors in March. The portal conducted the survey from May 19 for six days. About a quarter of the 12,777 people surveyed disagreed with idea of Mahathir for prime minister, it said.

Building on soaring user numbers of its Grab ride-hailing app and GrabPay function, the five-year-old start-up aims to transform into a consumer technology firm that also offers loans, electronic money transfer and money-market funds.  These are all things under consideration for sure,  Anthony Tan, Grab's 35-year-old co-founder and group chief executive officer, said in an interview.  Whether we are to execute any anytime soon, I can't share that off the top of my head.  Grab facilitates as many as 2.5 million rides each day, making it the largest ride-hailing platform in Southeast Asia with over 930,000 drivers in 55 cities and seven countries. In the past six months alone, daily rides have more than doubled. It also provides micro finance to help drivers buy phones and has helped two-thirds open their first bank accounts - practices it said it aims to expand as it seeks to broaden its financial services and build a consumer brand. No Need to List The Singapore-based startup raised $750 million in a funding round in September, with sources valuing it at over $3 billion. Its current investors include Chinese peer Didi Chuxing, China Investment Corp, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) and Vertex Ventures Holdings - a subsidiary of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd.  I can't specifically give a time line but I can imagine somewhere in the near future, there probably could be more money coming in. That's probably quite likely,  Tan said. A Grab motorbike helmet is displayed during Grab's fifth anniversary news conference in Singapore June 6, 2017.Edgar SuThe company is not profitable overall but is profitable in some markets, said Tan, who founded Grab with former McKinsey & Co consultant Tan Hooi Ling when they were at Harvard Business School in the United States.  We have been very blessed with capital. There is really no need to (list on the stock exchange) this year, next year,  he said. Slideshow (5 Images)Spending Less Tan said Grab is spending less on promotions and incentives for drivers to log more rides, even as competition with Uber increased after the U.S. firm exited China market last year.  Market share clearly shows that today we have something like 70 percent across the region,  Tan said, attributing the figure to localizing its services and investing in technology. Grab recently launched JustGrab which pools taxis and private cars together to help passengers book a vehicle quicker. It also offers GrabHitch and GrabShare car-pooling and shuttle services. Grab bought Indonesian payment service Kudo earlier this year, and Tan said Grab is seeking more acquisitions to support rapid growth.  You will see more happening across the region with GrabPay. The first big thing was obviously the Kudo acquisition, the second one is building an engineering center dedicated to payments,  he said.

Delivery Hero said on Tuesday it would issue new shares worth about 450 million euros, while existing shareholders including Rocket Internet (RKET.DE) may sell up to the same amount, people close to the matter have said. Founded in Berlin in 2011, Delivery Hero has grown rapidly and now employs over 6,000 people, providing a digital platform to order meals from more than 150,000 restaurants in 40 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia. Delivery Hero wants to have a strong net cash position so it can be prepared to grow both organically and through possible further acquisitions, Chief Executive Niklas Ostberg said.  This is a big step for us and the whole European tech scene,  Ostberg told a call for journalists. The listing - expected in the coming weeks - would provide a much-needed boost to struggling German ecommerce investor Rocket Internet, which holds a 35 percent stake in Delivery Hero, making it the biggest holding in its portfolio. Rocket Internet had early success with online fashion firm Zalando (ZALG.DE), which listed in 2014, but it has not brought any other companies to market yet.  Rocket's shares have rallied in anticipation of the Delivery Hero IPO but were flat on Tuesday at 21.51 euros. South African media and e-commerce firm Naspers (NPNJn.J) took a 10 percent stake in Delivery Hero last month.

Picture taken June 2, 2017.Fabrizio BenschWell-Trodden Path There has been a wave of capital raising and consolidation in online meal delivery as Uber and Amazon push into the sector, with Delivery Hero last week buying Middle East rival Carriage. Delivery Hero will become the fourth major online food delivery firm to go public in recent years, following GrubHub (GRUB.N), Just Eat (JE.L) and Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS), which have all seen their shares soar since listing. The Delivery Hero headquarters is pictured in Berlin, Germany, June 2, 2017.Fabrizio BenschDelivery Hero narrowed its loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to 116 million euros last year from 175 million in 2015, with half of that due to increased  costs, including heavy marketing, for its Foodora unit which delivers from high-end restaurants. Ostberg said the reason the company was still loss-making, unlike rivals such as GrubHub and Just Eat, was because Delivery Hero is operating in less mature markets and investing more in marketing. Delivery Hero may use the IPO proceeds to step up marketing spending by 10-15 percent, a person close to the company said on condition of anonymity. Delivery Hero takes a commission of about 1.60 euros - or 10 or 11 percent on each average order - and slightly higher fees if it does the delivery itself, compared to figures closer to 15 percent or above for peers like Just Eat and GrubHub.  Citigroup, Goldman Sachs International and Morgan Stanley will act as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners, Delivery Hero said. UniCredit Bank AG, Berenberg, Jefferies and UBS Investment Bank have been mandated as additional joint bookrunners.

Mahathir served as prime minister for 22 years until he stepped down in 2003. But he remained influential and has over the past couple of years emerged as a leader of opposition to Prime Minister Najib Razak. Najib has been embroiled in a corruption scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).  Najib has denied any wrongdoing and has managed to consolidate his power by sacking critics in his administration and clamping down on investigations even as the fund became the subject of money laundering investigations in the United States and at least five other countries. Mahathir told a business forum he did not want to be prime minister though he was often asked about the possibility, adding he would consider leading the opposition into an election due by the middle of next year, if all opposition parties agreed.  If there is really no candidate to become prime minister should the opposition win, then maybe for a short while I might try to take the job. But only on condition that everybody agrees,  he said. Mahathir, Malaysia's longest-serving prime minister, earned a reputation as a no-nonsense authoritarian with little time for dissenters promoting liberal values. He quit the ruling United Malays National Organisation party last year in response to the graft allegations surrounding his former protégé, Najib. Mahathir formed a new party and joined the opposition coalition aiming to oust Najib. The country's most prominent opposition politician, Anwar Ibrahim, is in prison serving five years for a sodomy conviction that he says was politically motivated. Government sources have told Reuters a general election could be held later this year in a bid to prevent Mahathir's new party from gaining ground with the majority ethnic Malay Muslim community, the core voter base for Najib's coalition.

Police raided the offices of EDP, grid operator REN and the local division of U.S. consulting firm Boston Consulting Group on Friday in a probe of past contracts on the electricity market, saying it suspected  crimes of active and passive corruption.  EDP CEO Antonio Mexia told journalists  no  when asked if he intended to resign.  There was clearly no benefit for EDP, either in 2004 or in 2007,  said Mexia.  The company's management and supervisory bodies cannot take lightly people's good names being called into question.  Joao Manso Neto, the head of EDP's renewables division EDPR , as well as two directors at REN, have also been named as suspects. EDP chairman Eduardo Catroga told the same press conference that EDP shareholders stood by Mexia. Portugal's public prosecutor has said the investigation is linked to hundreds of millions of euros of state compensation paid to former monopoly EDP for giving up some long-term power-purchase contracts as part of the liberalisation of the power sector. Mexia said the European Commission had looked into the same contracts, dating back to 2004, and decided to shelve the case. The CEO said the contracts in question were negotiated between Portugal's government and the European Commission. Shares in EDP were 2.3 percent higher on Tuesday after sliding on Monday.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who holds cabinet rank in President Donald Trump's administration, said last week Washington would decide on whether to withdraw from the Council after its three-week session in Geneva ends this month. Under Trump, Washington has broken with decades of U.S. foreign policy by turning away from multilateralism. His decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement last week drew criticism from governments around the world.   The Council's critical stance of Israel has been a major sticking point for its ally the United States. Washington boycotted the body for three years under President George W. Bush before rejoining under Barack Obama in 2009. Haley, writing in the Washington Post at the weekend, called for the Council to  end its practice of wrongly singling out Israel for criticism.  The possibility of a U.S. withdrawal has raised alarm bells among Western allies and activists. Eight groups, including Freedom House and the Jacob Blaustein Institute, wrote to Haley in May saying a withdrawal would be counterproductive since it could lead to the Council  unfairly targeting Israel to an even greater degree.  In the letter, seen by Reuters, the groups also said that during the period of the U.S. boycott, the Council's performance suffered  both with respect to addressing the world's worst violators and with respect to its anti-Israel bias.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley attends the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland June 6, 2017.Denis BalibouseThe Council has no powers other than to rebuke governments it deems as violating human rights and to order investigations but plays an important role in international diplomacy.  Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory are a fixed item on the agenda of the 47-member body set up in 2006. Washington, Israel's main ally, often casts the only vote against the Arab-led resolutions.  When the council passes more than 70 resolutions against Israel, a country with a strong human rights record, and just seven resolutions against Iran, a country with an abysmal human rights record, you know something is seriously wrong,  wrote Haley. An empty seat is pictured before a news conference at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, May 15, 2017.Denis BalibouseJohn Fisher, Geneva director of the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, did not appear to fear an immediate withdrawal.  Our understanding is that it is going to be a message of engagement and reform,  Fisher told reporters.  However, Fisher said Israel's human rights record did warrant Council scrutiny, but the special focus was  a reasonable concern .   It is an anomaly that there is a dedicated agenda item in a way that there isn't for North Korea or Syria or anything else,  he said. Haley also challenged the membership of Communist Cuba and Venezuela citing rights violations, proposing  competitive voting to keep the worst human rights abusers from obtaining seats . She made no mention of Egypt or Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies elected despite quashing dissent. The U.S. envoy will host a panel on  Human Rights and Democracy in Venezuela  and address the Graduate Institute in Geneva before heading to Israel.

Sources familiar with the situation said a majority of shareholders in the group look set to accept an offer after days of intense talks delayed the start of a long-awaited trial. RBS has offered shareholders 82 pence per share in its latest settlement attempt. The deal will cost the bank roughly 200 million pounds. The deal draws a line under a five-year lawsuit that was due to call disgraced former CEO Fred Goodwin to testify and has been unprecedented in English legal history for its compexity.

In October, Fujitsu had said it was in talks with Lenovo to cooperate in the design and manufacture of PCs. The companies had been aiming to finalize an agreement by the end of March.  We are in the final stages of working out how best to create synergies for our two companies,  Tanaka said at a press conference on the company's strategy.  We expect to wrap it up soon.  It's not like something unexpected happened, but we are trying to discuss everything thoroughly,  Tanaka said. The talks are unfolding at a time when sales of increasingly sophisticated smartphones and tablet computers squeeze demand in a global PC market that peaked half a decade ago. For Lenovo, the world's largest PC maker, a deal could help boost its purchasing power and consolidate its footing in a PC market where profit margins are thin. Its previous PC deals include buying the PC division of International Business Machines Corp in 2005 and creating a PC joint venture with NEC Corp in 2011. When asked on Tuesday about media reports that Fujitsu will join a government-led bidding consortium for struggling Toshiba Corp, Tanaka said he was cautious about such a move and that it will be hard to convince Fujitsu shareholders on it.  We always want to be accountable to our shareholders for what we do and this is also the case. In that context I do not think we can make rational reasons why we want to join the consortium,  he said.

The remarks were the first official confirmation of last month's statement by China Labor Watch, a New York-based advocacy group, that one activist had been arrested and two were missing after studying conditions at factories that produce shoes for the daughter of U.S. President Donald Trump and other Western brands. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the activists were detained and investigated on suspicion of interfering with a company's  normal operation and production activities , and the illegal use of  professional surveillance equipment .  The case was being handled in accordance with the law and  no country had the right to interfere in the judicial process, she told a daily news briefing in the Chinese capital.      On Monday, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department expressed concern over reports that Chinese authorities had detained labor rights activist Hua Haifeng and that two other labor activists – Su Heng and Li Zhao – were also missing and  presumed to have been detained.   We urge China to release them immediately and otherwise afford them the judicial and fair trial protections to which they are entitled,  said the spokeswoman, Alicia Edwards.    Labour activists have helped U.S. companies understand conditions in their China supply chains,  which can be essential in fulfilling their own responsibilities and holding Chinese manufacturers accountable under Chinese labor laws,  she added. China Labor Watch said Hua Haifeng was arrested in southeastern Jiangxi province on suspicion of illegally using eavesdropping equipment. He and Li Zhao had worked covertly at a shoe factory owned by the Huajian Group in the city of Dongguan, in southern Guangdong province. The third investigator, Su Heng, had worked at a related factory in the Jiangxi city of Ganzhou, but had been incommunicado after May 27. Both factories produced Ivanka Trump-branded shoes, China Labor Watch said. The investigators had discovered evidence that workers' rights had been violated, it said. The Ivanka Trump brand, the White House and Ivanka Trump's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, have not responded to requests for comment on the case. The case comes at a time of sustained pressure on labor activists in China amid a crackdown on civil society under President Xi Jinping.  In recent years, many labor rights activists have reported being intimidated and harassed, temporarily detained, or having had their movements restricted. Rights group Amnesty International has called for the release of the three if they were held only for investigating possible labor abuses at the factories.

The world's third-largest palm plantation group has begun an internal probe after external auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers found  a few things that were not right  about dealings between FGV unit Delima Oil Products Sdn Bhd and Safitex, an Afghan company. Turmoil at FGV as well as the slide in the firm's share prices could have implications for Prime Minister Najib Razak. Its shareholders, many of them small landowners, form a key vote bank for Najib's ruling alliance in battleground states and he is expected to expected to call elections later this year.  We are doing the investigations, we give a chance to the team to do the investigations until we are satisfied,  FGV Chairman Mohd Isa Abdul Samad told a news conference. Chief Executive Zakaria Arshad has denied wrongdoing and refused to resign, according to a letter seen by Reuters. A company spokesman told Reuters that Zakaria had extended a letter of credit for a transaction involving Delima and Safitex, a move the board felt was a breach of regular procedure. Zakaria did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. The management upheaval follows a storm of criticism in 2015 after FGV said it would buy a stake in Indonesian palm oil firm PT Eagle High Plantations - a deal critics saw as politically motivated and overpriced. FGV dropped the deal although it was later completed by another unit of the wider Felda group. Placed on Leave Felda settlers, or land owners, are the majority voters in at least 54 of the 222 seats in the parliament. They own shares in FGV, which raised over $3 billion in a listing in 2012. FGV's shares ended the day down 6.4 percent at 1.62 ringgit. Since the listing, the stock has fallen some 70 percent to give the company a market value of just 5.9 billion ringgit ($1.4 billion). Felda, the biggest shareholder in FGV with a 34 percent stake, did not respond to requests for comment. FGV has told CEO Zakaria as well as CFO Ahmad Tifli Mohd Talha to take a leave of absence effective immediately, the company said. In a June 5 letter to Mohd Isa, seen by Reuters, Zakaria said he had been accused of wrongdoing in payments to the Afghan company, but denied the accusations.  The chairman has asked that I resign as president and FGV group chief executive due to accusations that I have violated corporate governance code,  he said in the letter.  The payment process... was approved and implemented by the previous chief executive... I am not guilty of those accusations and will not resign as instructed.  Speaking to the New Straits Times on Tuesday, Zakaria urged the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission to start an investigation, and threatened to take legal action if dismissed without just cause. Zakaria was appointed in April last year, replacing FGV's previous chief executive, who oversaw the failed deal to buy a stake in Eagle High. A board committee will take on the functions of the CEO in the interim, the company said. The CFO would be replaced by Aznur Kama Azmir, the group's financial controller for its plantation sector.

Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates and Egypt - both highly reliant on Qatari gas via pipeline and LNG - and Bahrain said they would sever all ties including transport links with Qatar, an escalation on past diplomatic spats.  They accuse Qatar, which supplies roughly a third of global LNG - natural gas that has been converted to liquid form for export - of supporting extremism.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who accompanied President Donald Trump on his trip to Saudi Arabia last month, was CEO of Exxon Mobil - Qatar's key Western partner in building its giant LNG export plants.  As the rift lifted oil prices, LNG traders took a wait-and-see approach, alert to potential disruption of regional energy flows but erring on the assumption that any trade shocks could be contained given well supplied global markets.     Qatar's top clients in Japan and India quickly received reassurances that supplies would continue as usual.  Within hours of the diplomatic break, the UAE barred all vessels coming to or from Qatar using its popular anchorage point off Fujairah.  Related CoverageQatar-UAE gas pipeline operating normally, no impact from political tensions: sourcesQatargas tells Japan's JERA no LNG supply impact after riftRussia: no alarm for oil, gas industry after Qatar diplomatic row - sourceThe ban impacts about six LNG vessels linked to Qatar now anchored in the Fujairah zone which may need to be moved out, according to shipping data on Thomson Reuters.  But there was little sign yet of LNG supply being hit.   I cannot see this impacting exports of Qatari LNG outside the Arab world at all and it won't likely impact LNG and gas pipeline exports within the Arab world either,  Morten Frisch, an independent LNG and gas industry consultant, said.  Still, traders startled by the development began to plan for all eventualities, especially any upsets to piped gas supplies from Qatar to the UAE.  The UAE consumes 1.8 billion cubic feet/day of Qatari gas via the Dolphin pipeline, and has LNG purchase agreements with its neighbor, leaving it doubly exposed to tit-for-tat measures, industry sources and traders said.  So far flows through Dolphin are unaffected but traders say even a partial shutdown would ripple through global gas markets by forcing the UAE to seek replacement LNG supply just as its domestic demand peaks.  With LNG markets in bearish mood and demand weak, the UAE could cope with Qatar suspending its two to three monthly LNG deliveries by calling on international markets, but Dolphin piped flows are too large to fully replace.   A drop off in Dolphin deliveries would have a huge impact on LNG markets,  one trader monitoring developments said.  Spot LNG prices have not yet reacted.  Egypt, while relying heavily on Qatari LNG brought in by Swiss commodity trade houses, is less vulnerable than the UAE because it has no direct deals with Qatar, domestic gas output is squeezing out the need for imports, and traders would be liable for any moves by Qatar to restrict exports.   Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol frequently take LNG from Qatar and deliver it to Egypt but they take ownership of the cargoes at the Qatari port and don't use Qatari ships, meaning technically that Qatar shouldn't have sway,  one trade source said.  In reality though, Qatar can block exports to certain countries by issuing so-called destination restrictions.   It's not clear yet,  another LNG trader said of potential impacts to deliveries from Qatar to Egypt.  Egypt is halfway through its annual LNG cargo delivery program for the year, with 50 shipments left to arrive, of which at least 10 are of Qatari origin, a Cairo-based energy source said.  Retaliatory measures such as suspending LNG supply deals would leave Qatar free to push more volumes into Europe where it has access to several import terminals.  Under that scenario, trade houses with supply commitments to Egypt could turn to the United States, Algeria and Nigeria for replacement cargoes, traders and industry sources said.  The deterioration in ties between Qatar and Egypt contrasts with 2013 when the producer gifted five LNG cargoes to Egypt - when Mohamed Mursi, leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, served as president.

Championship leader Vettel has won three of the six races so far, finishing second in the rest, and scored nearly twice as many points as team mate Kimi Raikkonen. Mercedes have also won three races but they have been shared between Britain's triple champion Lewis Hamilton, with two victories but now 25 points behind Ferrari's German, and Finland's Valtteri Bottas.  We have two excellent drivers and we will hold true to our philosophy of letting them race each other to drive the team forward -- even if sometimes it can be difficult because you can't always have the one who is ahead in the championship winning,  Wolff said in a team preview of Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix. Hamilton, who was only seventh in the previous race in Monaco, has 104 points to Bottas's 75. Both Mercedes drivers have gone well in Canada in the past, Hamilton winning for the last two years at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and five times in total -- making it his most successful circuit along with Hungary. Bottas has also been on the podium in Canada for the last two years, with his previous team Williams. Hamilton told reporters in Monaco, where Ferrari finished first and second, that it was clear to him that the Italian team were favouring Vettel.  It's clear to me that Ferrari have chosen their number one driver,  he said.  They are pushing everything to make sure Sebastian will maximize on all of his weekends.  The Briton added, however, that he saw no need to change Mercedes' approach.  Valtteri has been doing a great job and I don't feel like we have to favor one over the other,  he said.  We have to work collectively as a team more than ever before to beat the Ferraris in the constructors' (championship).  Ferrari lead champions Mercedes by 17 points in the constructors' standings. Wolff, who said in Monaco that Mercedes were now the underdogs, acknowledged that it hurt.  We have to fight with all that we are worth for every single win, pole position, podium finish and every point,  he said.  You can no longer expect that when you look at a timesheet the two Mercedes (cars) will be right at the top.

The airline, partly-owned by Air France KLM and the Kenyan government, has struggled to return to profit after tourist traffic slumped four years ago following a spate of attacks by Somalia-based Islamist militants. The government will also convert its existing loans to the carrier into equity, it said. It was not immediately clear how much it has lent the carrier, but a source at the airline said it was a  significant  amount lent over time. The plan to guarantee the existing debt will be taken to the National Assembly for approval, the government said.  The guarantees would be in exchange for material concessions to be provided as part of the financial restructuring which would secure future funding for the company,  the cabinet document said, without giving details on the concessions. The government views the airline as a strategic asset, supporting other industries such as tourism and encouraging investments from abroad. Several international firms have set up their regional headquarters in Nairobi to take advantage of Kenya Airways' extensive route network on the continent. Kenya Airways ferries 12,000 passengers a day on its fleet of Boeing and Embraer planes to destinations such as Juba and Accra. At 1012 GMT, Kenya Airways shares were down 1.5 percent at 6.65 shillings. The government would not provide additional cash as part of the restructuring of the airline, it added. The debt owed to the U.S Exim bank is related to the financing of the purchase of the carrier's Boeing planes. Kenya Airways says the financial restructuring will involve restructuring debt and securing additional capital to help dig itself out of a position of negative equity, and attain a better balance between cash flow and debt repayments.

The remarks were the first official confirmation of last month's statement by China Labor Watch, a New York-based advocacy group, that one activist had been arrested and two were missing after studying conditions at factories that produce shoes for the daughter of U.S. President Donald Trump and other Western brands. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the activists were detained and investigated on suspicion of interfering with a company's  normal operation and production activities , and the illegal use of  professional surveillance equipment .  The case was being handled in accordance with the law and  no country had the right to interfere in the judicial process, she told a daily news briefing in the Chinese capital.      On Monday, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department expressed concern over reports that Chinese authorities had detained labor rights activist Hua Haifeng and that two other labor activists – Su Heng and Li Zhao – were also missing and  presumed to have been detained.   We urge China to release them immediately and otherwise afford them the judicial and fair trial protections to which they are entitled,  said the spokeswoman, Alicia Edwards.    Labour activists have helped U.S. companies understand conditions in their China supply chains,  which can be essential in fulfilling their own responsibilities and holding Chinese manufacturers accountable under Chinese labor laws,  she added. China Labor Watch said Hua Haifeng was arrested in southeastern Jiangxi province on suspicion of illegally using eavesdropping equipment. He and Li Zhao had worked covertly at a shoe factory owned by the Huajian Group in the city of Dongguan, in southern Guangdong province. The third investigator, Su Heng, had worked at a related factory in the Jiangxi city of Ganzhou, but had been incommunicado after May 27. Both factories produced Ivanka Trump-branded shoes, China Labor Watch said. The investigators had discovered evidence that workers' rights had been violated, it said. The Ivanka Trump brand, the White House and Ivanka Trump's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, have not responded to requests for comment on the case. The case comes at a time of sustained pressure on labor activists in China amid a crackdown on civil society under President Xi Jinping.  In recent years, many labor rights activists have reported being intimidated and harassed, temporarily detained, or having had their movements restricted. Rights group Amnesty International has called for the release of the three if they were held only for investigating possible labor abuses at the factories.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE, along with Egypt, Yemen and Bahrain, on Monday cut diplomatic ties with Qatar amid accusations the country supported terrorists. The Arab allies are applying many economic pressure points, including barring Qatari flagged ships from entering their waters. Around half a dozen oil, chemical and liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers coming from Qatar have left UAE waters or halted in the open ocean instead of docking in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned, according to shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon. Qatar is the world's biggest LNG exporter, sending shipments of the fuel used in power generation to key users in Japan, China and India, and the country also exports about 620,000 barrel per day of oil, among the smallest Middle East oil producers. However, vessels leaving Qatari ports typically refuel ahead of their voyages at the UAE port of Fujairah, the Gulf's largest ship-fuel or bunkering port. That is leaving shipowners and charters scrambling to plan the logistics for their vessels.  It's a big mess this morning,  said a Singapore-based shipbroker.  The Britanis super-tanker, capable of carrying up to 2 million barrels of oil, was parked in Fujairah's anchorage zone for the past week, but since Monday moved to just beyond Fujairah's port limits, the data on Eikon showed. Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States, or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world's most important ports for the global energy market. Besides refueling, vessels also merge cargoes with those of other tankers before sending blended supplies to their final destination. Ships looking to fuel in Fujairah may incur delays and higher costs after being forced to divert to nearby regional ports, or to Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India, and even as far as Singapore, shippers and traders said.  Some of the affected vessels sailing out of the Gulf will probably have to look toward Iraq, Iran, or Oman for bunkers, however, it depends on the political stance of those countries,” said commodities broker Matt Stanley at Freight Investor Services in Dubai.  Blocking the Qatari vessels could displace up to 25 percent of the between 800,000 and 900,000 tonnes of marine fuels sold in Fujairah each month, said two trade sources familiar with the market. Because of the small size of its oil exports, Qatari crude tends to be co-loaded onto tankers along with other regional crudes to make the voyage economical. That process may also be disrupted because of the ban.  While the UAE is clear in banning both Qatari-flagged vessels and ships coming from Qatar, it was not immediately certain whether Saudi Arabia is taking as strong of a position. The Aramco-owned supertanker Asian Progress V, which is under a Singaporean flag and carrying Qatar Land crude, remains berthed at Saudi Arabia's Ras Tanura Abu Sa'fah berth where Saudi Arab Medium crude loads. Oil-pricing agency S&P; Global Platts on Tuesday said it was reviewing the use of Qatari Al-Shaheen crude in its oil price assessments because of the port ban. Besides disrupting energy exports, the UAE ban on Qatari ships is impacting aluminum exports. Norsk Hydro on Tuesday said Qatari metal exports that typically were reloaded on larger ships at the UAE port of Jebel Ali have been blocked amid the ban.

The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark dropped 0.4 percent, falling for a second session, while euro zone stocks and blue-chips followed suit. The greatest downward pull came from healthcare stocks. Swiss drugmaker Roche fell 4.5 percent after investors were disappointed by findings in its Aphinity study for a key breast cancer treatment. Analysts at Liberum said they believed the study, which showed a lower than expected measure of improvement in disease free survival with Roche's treatment, could make clinical acceptance more difficult. Medical products company Convatec also fell 4.8 percent after shareholders Nordic Capital and Avista sold 250 million shares, raising 805 million pounds ($1 billion). A rift in the Middle East between Qatar and neighbours Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain caused oil to fall further below $50 a barrel, weighing on commodities-heavy European markets. In an early sign of Qatar's isolation impacting companies operating there, Norsk Hydro fell 1.8 percent after saying exports from the Qatalum aluminium plant in Qatar, a joint venture with Qatar Petroleum, were blocked due to the dispute. The company said it was seeking other routes. Basic resource stocks fell 0.8 percent, while energy stocks reversed earlier losses to trade 0.4 percent higher. Utilities were the best-performers as investors fled to safety. Sell-side enthusiasm on European equities seemed to moderate as Morgan Stanley said positive catalysts for the region were beginning to fade.  Europe has had a very strong run, and tactically it makes sense to look for a more moderate period for a while,  said Morgan Stanley equity strategist Matt Garman. A stronger euro, which weighs on foreign-earning European companies, diminishes the case for European equities, he said.  Rarely have the currency and positive equity market performance been correlated, and when they have it has been politics related,  Garman added, saying relief after the French elections had been felt across asset classes. The euro has gained 5.6 percent against the dollar over the past two months, and Morgan Stanley strategists expect it to rise further. Among the handful of gainers, Vestas Wind rose 2.9 percent after MHI Vestas, a joint venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, said it was launching a new wind turbine. Also among top gainers was Lufthansa, rising 2.6 percent after the German carrier's CEO said he was optimistic on demand and improving traffic from the United States and Asia. Spain's troubled Banco Popular hit another record low in choppy trading after Barclays cut its price target on the stock. The bank's shares have lost more than half their value over fears it could be wound down by regulators if it fails to find a buyer. $1 = 0.7732 pounds Reporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/europe-stocks-idUSL8N1J31HZ"},

Chinese state media are filled with stories about the stunning success of Horgos, the youngest city of China's new Silk Road. Last month at China's Belt and Road Summit - its biggest diplomatic event of the year - promotional videos about Horgos' booming economy ran on a loop at the press centre. But Chinese business owners and prospective investors who had recently visited the China-Kazakhstan Horgos International Border Cooperation Center (ICBC), told Reuters they were disappointed by the disconnect between the hype and reality. Rather than the vibrant 21st Century trading post of Beijing's grand vision, Horgos is instead developing a reputation as China's very own tax haven.  We were so unimpressed by what we saw that after looking around for three hours, we turned around and drove eight hours straight back to Urumqi,  said a businessman from the capital of China's far western region of Xianjiang, who only wanted to give his surname, Ma, due to the sensitivity of the topic. Several business owners echoed complaints about poor design and low visitor numbers made by Ma, who visited Horgos to investigate the viability of opening a high-end clubhouse.          You've got Kazakh farmers walking around with plastic bags full of cheap Chinese t-shirts and you want me to open a club for government officials and businessmen to meet inside the zone - which, by the way, you can't drive your car into and doesn't have any five-star hotels?  Ma said. On the Chinese side of the border there are five malls selling cheap consumer goods, though traders complain there are not enough visitors.  Sometimes I'll sit here for a whole day and not make a single sale,  said Ma Yinggui, 56, who has a market stall selling clothes.  Some Kazakhs are rich but most are poor. They come and haggle over a 20 yuan ($2.93) t-shirt.  More than five years after the 5.3 sq km trade zone opened, much of the Kazakh side remains empty. Only 25 of the 63 projects on the Kazakh side have investors, according to Ravil Budukov, ICBC press secretary on the Kazakh side. About 3-4,000 people enter from Kazakhstan each day and around 10,000 from China, he added. The Xinjiang and Horgos governments declined to make officials available for comment to Reuters for this article. Huang Sanping, a senior Xinjiang government official, told Reuters at a news conference in Beijing that he had just returned from a visit to Horgos, a city  performing extremely well. It's full of vitality and flourishing . China's Tax Haven Beijing has bestowed numerous tax breaks and preferential policies on Horgos hoping to stimulate growth in this strategic border town in Xinjiang, a key link on the new Silk Road between China and Central Asia, where the government says it is battling to defeat Islamist extremism. According to Horgos' tax bureau, 2,411 companies registered in Horgos last year, taking advantage of five years of no company tax, and a further five years paying half rate. At least half those companies are registered in Horgos solely for tax purposes, estimates Meng Shen, Director of Chanson & Co, a boutique investment bank in Beijing. A view of a rail mounted gantry crane is seen at the Khorgos Eastern Gateway in Khorgos, Kazakhstan May 17, 2017. Picture taken May 17, 2017.Sue-Lin WongChinese celebrities are opting to register production companies in Horgos and an increasing number of financial services and IT companies are also registering there, according to Guan Xuemei from Shenzhou Shunliban, a tax advisory firm that recently opened an office there. But with no obligation to operate from Horgos or even in Xinjiang, it is unlikely this policy will create jobs or bring money to what has long been an economic backwater, say experts.   In theory this is a good policy because it aims to stimulate the local economy,  said Shen.  But Beijing didn't think through the fact lots of companies wouldn't actually want to operate from Horgos which is very far away from China's economic center.  Those who do trade in the  free trade zone  find they face restrictions from both sides. The Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) - of which Kazakhstan is a member - limits traders from the Kazakh side to importing up to 50 kg (110 lbs) of any goods per month duty-free. Slideshow (11 Images)China bans imports of many food products - the Kazakh goods most desired by Chinese consumers worried about food safety at home - and caps traders from taking more than 8,000 yuan ($1,175) worth of goods out each day.   The EEU is a significant barrier because Russia and Kazakhstan and other Central Asia countries want to develop their own industries, they don't want to constantly rely on cheap Chinese goods,  said a former Chinese government official turned businessman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  Mao Shishi, 44, who currently raises cattle in nearby Qingshuihe, wants to import wool and wild herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine from Kazakhstan to China through Horgos.  I'm watching and waiting for any policy changes. Right now we can't import lamb, fish or wild herbs into China,  Mao said. Logistics Thoroughfare Plans to develop a parallel special economic zone in Khorgos - as it is known on the Kazakh side - as a logistics hub appear to be having more success.  Trade volumes are sky-rocketing at the Khorgos Gateway dry port in Kazakhstan, where container freight is lifted off Chinese trains and onto Kazakh ones because of different gauge rail tracks.  According to our plans, this year we are going to trans-ship around 100,000 TEUs, five times more than we are doing now,  said Asset Seisenbek, head of the commercial department at Khorgos Gateway, referring to  twenty-foot equivalent units , an industry measure based on standard shipping container sizes. Electronics giants HP and Foxconn both ship goods through the dry port, which is faster than sea freight but cheaper than air cargo. One container sent by sea to Europe is about three times cheaper than rail, while air freight is between five to 10 times more expensive, according to Seisenbek. Last month China's COSCO Shipping and Lianyungang port took a 49 percent stake in Khorgos Gateway which Seisenbek sees as an opportunity to attract more Chinese business. This sort of investment is what Horgos/Khorgos should hang its hat on, according to Ma, the businessman underwhelmed by the international free trade zone.  The free trade zone doesn't need to be that successful if the intercontinental trains and roads take off,  he said.  In the grand scheme of things, that's the main role for this part of the world.

Russia tycoons would rather ship themselves off shore","keywords":"Russia,Andrei Sharonov,Chris Weafer,Konstantin Korishchenko,Vladimir Potanin,Vladimir Putin,US,RUSSIA,ECONOMY,TAX,INSIGHT,Banks (TRBC),Russia,Insights,Taxation,Special Reports,Corporate Events,Economic Events,East European Countries,Major News,Europe,Regulation,Pictures,Economic News (3rd Party),Banking Services (Legacy)","sector":"Markets","content":"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Some of Russia's super-rich have given up residency to escape a 2014 law requiring them to disclose offshore assets, wealthy businessmen told Reuters, a practice that could keep billions of dollars hidden from Moscow's tax authorities. Interviews with more than a dozen people familiar with the practice -- including prominent tycoons, wealth managers, lawyers and current and former officials -- suggest a swathe of Russia's national wealth is now in the hands of a new class of semi-exiled oligarchs, who keep bases in their homeland but escape its tax net by spending fewer than 183 days a year there.  You can scold them, call them unpatriotic, but the fact remains: the budget has lost out,  Vladimir Potanin, one of Russia's ten richest men, told Reuters about the practice. Potanin, co-owner of Arctic mining giant Norilsk Nickel, said he has remained a tax resident of Russia but watched as many of his peers moved out in response to the 2014 law. Two other people on Forbes Magazine's list of the 100 richest Russians told Reuters they had given up Russian residency to escape the law, speaking on condition that they not be identified to avoid hurting their Russian business dealings. Two more declined to say whether they had done so, but, like Potanin, said they also knew many fellow oligarchs who had. No official data has been made public on how many people have given up Russian residency to escape the law, or the overall size of the assets they have shielded from Russian tax jurisdiction through the practice. But Russian law firm Egorov, Puginsky, Afanasiev and Partners said it had conducted a survey of around 300 wealthy Russians and found as many as 40 percent of those with offshore companies had given up residency in Russia. Another 9 percent transferred the assets to relatives who are not tax residents. The law, popularly known in Russia as  de-offshorizatsia , requires all Russian taxpayers to declare their interest in offshore companies they control, on which they can then become liable to paying tax in Russia. It is similar to the standard practice in most western countries, but represented a change for Russia, where previously taxpayers could hold interests in companies abroad without declaring them. The change was a high-profile initiative of President Vladimir Putin, widely interpreted as a way to force Russians to do their patriotic duty by investing in their homeland. While there is no suggestion that it is illegal to avoid the law's requirements by giving up Russian residency, those who have done so told Reuters they accepted they were thwarting the law's aim. In response to Reuters questions, Russia's economy ministry said the de-offshorization law was in line with global practice. It said improving the investment climate was a government priority, with positive results, as demonstrated by Russia's improved ranking in the World Bank's ease of Doing Business index. Russia is now ranked 40th, up from 92nd in 2014. The Kremlin declined to comment. The finance ministry did not reply to a request for comment by the time of publication. In response to a list of questions, the tax service said the number of tax cases it was pursuing against Russians with foreign tax exposure was rising, but it did not directly address the questions. The impact of tax exiles giving up Russian residency is heightened because so much of the country's wealth is concentrated in the hands of relatively few people. According to Forbes, the 200 richest Russians have $460 billion in wealth, equivalent to nearly a third of Russia's nominal GDP.  People are forced to decide: do they keep their business in Russia or become citizens of the world and take their assets offshore,  said Konstantin Korishchenko, a former deputy head of the Russian central bank. A former official who has kept close ties to the Kremlin and talks often to Russian oligarchs said that by his estimate a third of Russia's top 500 businesspeople had left the country over the past three years, in part because of the new law. FILE PHOTO: A shop assistant (L) counts Russian rouble banknotes as customers gather at a store selling Apple products at the State Department Store, GUM, in central Moscow, Russia September 23, 2016.Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo It's Impossible Now  Some familiar with the practice said wealthy Russians were giving up their residency because they feared that disclosing their offshore companies would open them to the risk of the information being leaked to business rivals, or even abused by corrupt officials for spurious prosecutions or blackmail.  The first thing that entrepreneurs say is that there is a big sense of mistrust: mistrust toward each other, mistrust towards the state,  said Andrei Sharonov, dean of the Moscow School of Management, Skolkovo, which offers an MBA program. Sitting on the leather sofa in his office in one of Moscow's most prestigious commercial addresses, one of the tycoons who gave up his residency told Reuters he made the move reluctantly. Leaving his homeland for most of the year was a wrench. But because of the investment climate in Russia, he and his partners were looking for buyers for their Russian businesses and focusing instead on international holdings, he said. Slideshow (7 Images) I would stay here and would continue paying taxes here if it was not for this law,  the businessman told Reuters.  It's impossible now.  He now spends his time mostly in a European Union country where his family has settled some time ago, or traveling to meetings around the world. Such a lifestyle, he said, has become common among his peers since the law was passed:  Lots of people lived here and paid tax. Now they don't.  Another Russian businessman, a billionaire who also gave up his Russian residency over the de-offshorization law, told Reuters he and fellow tycoons were worried that it could be followed by further measures, tougher on businesspeople. After three years of deep recession, Russia's economy is stabilizing but has not yet returned to the steady growth needed to begin making up lost ground. The de-offshorization law is one of several factors discouraging investment in Russia, said Chris Weafer a senior partner at Russia-focussed consultancy Macro-Advisory Ltd.  It’s completely unrealistic to talk about raising growth rates to 4 percent, as Russian officials hope, without a sharp increase in inward investment,  he said. Businesspeople who spoke to Reuters said complying with the new rules meant they incurred hefty fees to lawyers and accountants to audit their offshore assets and prepare tax returns, they had to deal with a mountain of paperwork, and at the end risked having to paying more tax. Several said privacy was also an issue, in a country where vendors at flea markets sell CDs purported to contain leaked information from the tax authorities' databases. In the law firm's survey, almost two third of respondents said that they or their clients had encountered problems with leaks of confidential information from state services. Ultimately, people do not trust the authorities to keep their information safe, said the businessman on the Forbes list of 100 richest Russians who did not reveal whether he had given up his residency.  No one wants to show the money.

Qatar's royal family has since built up a portfolio of assets ranging from a Champs-Elysees shopping mall to the Lido cabaret.

The logic of linking Apple TV, a device for watching television over the internet, with Amazon.com Inc's booming video-streaming service looks obvious.  Apple needs great video to sell its TV player. Amazon needs places to stream its TV shows so that people sign up for its Prime club to watch them - and buy more toilet paper, too. Viewers want to watch their favorite programs on whatever device they choose. Yet Monday's announcement, rather than being routine, was the result of a negotiation stretching back at least to 2015 when Amazon stopped selling Apple TVs on its retail site. Amazon had explained that move by saying it wanted to avoid confusing customers who would expect Prime Video to be on devices sold by Amazon. Critics instead saw a negotiating tactic to get Prime Video onto the Apple device, and a prod for people to buy Amazon's competing Fire TV players.  Whenever these companies try to freeze each other out, the consumer always loses,  said Paul Verna, an analyst at research firm eMarketer. Amazon and Apple declined to comment on how their differences have affected customers. The companies said Amazon shows will be available on Apple TV later this year, but did not specify a date. Streaming is not the only example where a spat between Apple and Amazon limited customer choice. Amazon's popular voice-controlled speaker, the Echo, can be told to play songs from an Amazon music account or even Spotify, but not from Apple Music. Amazon's Kindle app for Apple's iPhone lets people read but not buy books, which must be purchased directly from Amazon's website. According to former Amazon employees, the company at times brings in tangential business concerns as leverage in negotiations.  The outcomes of these deals may factor into future conversations,  said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. It was not clear how Amazon and Apple came to terms on the video player. Analysts estimate that the ascendance of Prime Video gave Amazon a better starting point for negotiations. Its shows and films have started winning awards, including three Oscars in 2017. The internet video player with most market share, Roku, not only offers Prime Video but has a smaller price tag than Apple TV.   It put Apple TV at a big disadvantage,  said Alan Wolk, lead analyst for TV industry publication TV[R]EV. Amazon declined to comment on whether it will again sell Apple TVs.

Labour Secretary Silvestre Bello said the ban would be in place until the government has completed its assessment.   I temporarily suspend the deployment of our OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) in the county of Qatar. This is for us to be able to assess the situation because there are so many wild rumors going around, saying things are not going well there,  Bello said in a statement on Tuesday.  Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed diplomatic relations with Qatar in a coordinated move, accusing it of support for Islamist militants and Iran. More than 2 million people from the Philippines are working in the Middle East as domestic helpers, construction workers, engineers and nurses, with Qatar hosting 250,000 and Saudi Arabia hosting almost a million.  Filipinos working in the Middle East sent home $7.6 billion in remittances in 2016, making the region a major source of foreign exchange inflows which help drive one of Asia's fastest growing economies. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman said the government was concerned about the possible  ripple effects  of the Arab-Qatar rift on its workers abroad.  Concerned government agencies are looking at the matter and will extend assistance and other support for OFWs who may be affected by such action,  Ernesto Abella told a media briefing.  The Philippines is one of the world's largest recipients of remittances. For the whole of 2017, the central bank expects remittances to grow 4 percent from last year's $26.9 billion, which was equal to around 10 percent of gross domestic product.

The investigation is embarrassing for Macron who has put political probity front and center of his first weeks in power, ahead of legislative elections where Macron hopes his new party will win control of parliament and cement his grip on power. The search was carried out on Thursday after the public prosecutor in Brest launched a preliminary investigation into allegations against Richard Ferrand, focused on his management of Mutuelles de Bretagne, regional daily Telegramme reported on Tuesday. The allegations include renting office space from his partner and hiring his son as an assistant paid from parliamentary funds.  Ferrand, who was Macron's campaign chief and is now a cabinet minister, has denied wrongdoing. He has the backing of Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who has said Ferrand's actions might raise moral questions but not judicial ones and that he sees no reason to ask him to resign. Hiring family members as parliamentary assistants is not illegal in France but is increasingly scorned upon by the public.  Last week Justice Minister Francois Bayrou presented to cabinet a draft ethics law aimed at cleaning up politics in France.  With this law in place, such a thing would not happen,  Bayrou told BFM TV on Tuesday.  The idea to change the way people behave in public life was a pillar of Macron's campaign.  Opinion polls show LREM is on course to win a majority in the National Assembly and that the Ferrand affair has not impacted voter intentions. In France, the opening of a preliminary inquiry does not imply guilt. Prosecutors decide after such preliminary checks whether there are grounds for a full-scale probe or not.

He said he had agreed with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen that the German cabinet would deal with the issue on Wednesday. He also said the defence ministry had already been working on a withdrawal plan. Turkey's ties with Germany and other European Union states deteriorated sharply in the run-up to Turkey's April 16 referendum that handed President Tayyip Erdogan stronger presidential powers. Germany, citing security concerns, banned some Turkish politicians from addressing rallies of expatriate Turks before the referendum. Ankara responded by accusing Berlin of  Nazi-like  tactics, drawing rebukes from Berlin. Turkey has reignited a row over access to German forces on its territory by imposing new restrictions on German lawmakers visiting Incirlik. The German deployment at Incirlik is part of a mission providing reconnaissance aircraft to support U.S.-led coalition operations against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Gabriel said the defence ministry had concluded it now made more sense logistically to send Germany's Tornado jets to Jordan.  We have no interest in pushing Turkey into a corner ... we don't want to push it towards Russia,  Gabriel said.  This is no small thing but it is about more than Incirlik, it's about our relationship with Turkey,  he said. Turkey has been seeking to improve relations with Russia. Last month it agreed plans with Moscow and Tehran to reduce the fighting in Syria, and has been working to end economic barriers imposed after Turkey shot down a Russian plane near the Syrian border in 2015. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said after meeting Gabriel in Ankara on Monday that relations with Germany had suffered recently, but that trade and investment between the two countries were still strong.  We spoke about how we can focus on this more, what steps could be taken to increase contact between the two nations and disperse this negative atmosphere,  he said. Berlin is also worried about a security crackdown in Turkey after last year's failed coup. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from their jobs and 50,000 people jailed pending trial.  Turkey wants an expansion of the customs union. We say we are ready for that ... but you have to move, too,  said Gabriel, who stressed that adhering to the rule of law was necessary. Germany has also pushed for the release of German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who was arrested in Turkey in February on a charge of spreading terrorist propaganda.

The blue chip FTSE 100 inched 0.1 percent lower to 7,517.73 points by 0924 GMT, while the more domestically-exposed mid cap index dropped 0.8 percent to a two-week low. Large caps came under pressure for a second session in a row as sterling continued its climb to hit a 12-day high as investors bet on a win for the ruling Conservative party in the election. A stronger pound tends to weigh on the FTSE 100's more internationally-facing constituents.  We're seeing some mixed messages from polls, some would suggest that big gap between the Conservatives and the Labour party is narrowing. Now that we're seeing that, people are unsure,  David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said.  (With) some of the recent polls muddying the waters, (investors) are using that to bank some profits and play the wait and see game.  Medical technology firm ConvaTec was the biggest individual faller, down nearly 5 percent after two investors sold a higher stake via a placing. Luxury goods firm Burberry was also down 2.7 percent after HSBC cut its rating on the stock to  reduce  from  hold , citing a lack of visibility on the top line.  Every shareholder friendly initiative seems to have been looked at to enable Burberry shares to be protected in the absence of what, in our view, would be the only real solid booster: a sustainable rebound in sales growth,  analysts at HSBC said in a note. Miners also added pressure to the index, with names such as Antofagasta, Anglo American and BHP Billiton declining between 0.8 percent to 1.7 percent as the price of copper eased. Among mid caps, AO World dropped 6.6 percent and hit its lowest level since July 2016 after the online retailer warned of a significant slowdown in UK sales growth in the first quarter.

The ruling will be published via a press release at 0730 GMT (0930 CET, the German Constitutional Court said in a statement on Tuesday. E.ON, RWE and EnBW are pinning their hopes on the verdict as it marks the last chance to challenge the tax after the European Court of Justice in 2015 ruled that it did not breach European Union laws.

The investigation is embarrassing for Macron who has put political probity front and center of his first weeks in power, ahead of legislative elections where Macron hopes his new party will win control of parliament and cement his grip on power. The search was carried out on Thursday after the public prosecutor in Brest launched a preliminary investigation into allegations against Richard Ferrand, focused on his management of Mutuelles de Bretagne, regional daily Telegramme reported on Tuesday. The allegations include renting office space from his partner and hiring his son as an assistant paid from parliamentary funds.  Ferrand, who was Macron's campaign chief and is now a cabinet minister, has denied wrongdoing. He has the backing of Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who has said Ferrand's actions might raise moral questions but not judicial ones and that he sees no reason to ask him to resign. Hiring family members as parliamentary assistants is not illegal in France but is increasingly scorned upon by the public.  Last week Justice Minister Francois Bayrou presented to cabinet a draft ethics law aimed at cleaning up politics in France.  With this law in place, such a thing would not happen,  Bayrou told BFM TV on Tuesday.  The idea to change the way people behave in public life was a pillar of Macron's campaign.  Opinion polls show LREM is on course to win a majority in the National Assembly and that the Ferrand affair has not impacted voter intentions. In France, the opening of a preliminary inquiry does not imply guilt. Prosecutors decide after such preliminary checks whether there are grounds for a full-scale probe or not.

European stocks fell early on Tuesday after leading Arab powers cut ties with Qatar the previous day, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and Iran. Shares fell in U.S. and Asian trading on the back of concerns over politics either side of the Atlantic. On what BayernLB analysts called  Super Thursday , British voters will go to polls in an increasingly unpredictable general election, the European Central Bank is due to meet and later the same day former FBI director James Comey will testify before Congress.  We have a big week or so ahead of us with the UK heading to the polls and the ECB announcing its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday and the Federal Reserve doing the same next Wednesday,  said Craig Erlam, a market analyst for OANDA securities.  Once these events pass, we may have a little more clarity and therefore see a little less caution in the markets.  The diplomatic spat in the Middle East left oil prices hovering just below $50 a barrel and that in turn hit European stocks, which fell across the board; the broad Euro STOXX 600 was down 0.4 percent. World stocks edged further away from record highs hit last week, the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, fell 0.12 percent. Investors instead bought gold and German government bonds - two of the safest assets in the world - pushing gold prices to six-week highs and German 10-year borrowing costs to six-week lows. Erlam said the one area for concern is how steady sterling has been - the currency was up against the dollar and euro on Tuesday - potentially a sign of complacency before the election. The lead of British Prime Minister Theresa May over the opposition Labour Party ahead of Thursday's general election has narrowed to just 1 percentage point, according to a poll conducted before the attacks in London on Saturday. Other polls in recent days have found bigger leads for the Conservatives of up to 11 and 12 points. Sterling edged higher against both the dollar and the euro. , The dollar, meanwhile, touched a seven-month low ahead of Comey's testimony. Reports suggest the former FBI chief plans to talk about conversations in which U.S. President Trump pressured him to drop his investigation into former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of trade-weighted peers, fell to its lowest level since the November U.S. election. Data on Monday of U.S. services sector activity slowing in May as new orders tumbled also hit the greenback.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE, along with Egypt, Yemen and Bahrain, on Monday cut diplomatic ties with Qatar amid accusations the country supported terrorists. The Arab allies are applying many economic pressure points, including barring Qatari flagged ships from entering their waters. Around half a dozen oil, chemical and liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers coming from Qatar have left UAE waters or halted in the open ocean instead of docking in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned, according to shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon. Qatar is the world's biggest LNG exporter, sending shipments of the fuel used in power generation to key users in Japan, China and India, and the country also exports about 620,000 barrel per day of oil, among the smallest Middle East oil producers. However, vessels leaving Qatari ports typically refuel ahead of their voyages at the UAE port of Fujairah, the Gulf's largest ship-fuel or bunkering port. That is leaving shipowners and charters scrambling to plan the logistics for their vessels.  It's a big mess this morning,  said a Singapore-based shipbroker.  The Britanis super-tanker, capable of carrying up to 2 million barrels of oil, was parked in Fujairah's anchorage zone for the past week, but since Monday moved to just beyond Fujairah's port limits, the data on Eikon showed. Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States, or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world's most important ports for the global energy market. Besides refueling, vessels also merge cargoes with those of other tankers before sending blended supplies to their final destination. Ships looking to fuel in Fujairah may incur delays and higher costs after being forced to divert to nearby regional ports, or to Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India, and even as far as Singapore, shippers and traders said.  Some of the affected vessels sailing out of the Gulf will probably have to look toward Iraq, Iran, or Oman for bunkers, however, it depends on the political stance of those countries,” said commodities broker Matt Stanley at Freight Investor Services in Dubai.  Blocking the Qatari vessels could displace up to 25 percent of the between 800,000 and 900,000 tonnes of marine fuels sold in Fujairah each month, said two trade sources familiar with the market. Because of the small size of its oil exports, Qatari crude tends to be co-loaded onto tankers along with other regional crudes to make the voyage economical. That process may also be disrupted because of the ban.  While the UAE is clear in banning both Qatari-flagged vessels and ships coming from Qatar, it was not immediately certain whether Saudi Arabia is taking as strong of a position. The Aramco-owned supertanker Asian Progress V, which is under a Singaporean flag and carrying Qatar Land crude, remains berthed at Saudi Arabia's Ras Tanura Abu Sa'fah berth where Saudi Arab Medium crude loads. Oil-pricing agency S&P; Global Platts on Tuesday said it was reviewing the use of Qatari Al-Shaheen crude in its oil price assessments because of the port ban. Besides disrupting energy exports, the UAE ban on Qatari ships is impacting aluminum exports. Norsk Hydro on Tuesday said Qatari metal exports that typically were reloaded on larger ships at the UAE port of Jebel Ali have been blocked amid the ban.

MSCI's emerging market equity benchmark snapped a three-day winning streak to fall 0.2 percent, with bourses weakening in Asia , Africa and emerging Europe  . Currencies were also on their back foot with commodity markets under pressure. Iron ore markets suffered and copper prices dipped for a third straight session, weighed down by concerns over slowing growth in China and the United States.  From the bigger picture view, emerging markets just have to grapple with the new normal, China's growth is half of what it used to be, that is impacting oil, copper and iron ore,  said Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at BBH.  The Gulf countries worry about oil, and so does Latin America. Africa is worrying about iron ore and copper.  Oil prices took another leg lower, now firmly below the $50 per barrel threshold as the rift between Qatar and leading Arab powers fuelled concerns that an OPEC-led push to tighten crude markets looked increasingly frail while soaring U.S. output added to the woes. A number of Arab powers - including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain - severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, accusing Doha of support for Islamist militants and Iran, reopening some old festering wounds. The rift saw Qatar stocks and eurobonds tumble and the cost of insuring its debt against default rise. The Qatari riyal, which is pegged to the dollar, weakened against the U.S. currency in spot and forward markets.  Looking ahead it really depends on Qatar and Saudi Arabia getting together and sorting this out, otherwise you can see repercussions not only for oil but also for countries like Turkey,  said Simon Quijano-Evans, emerging markets strategist at Legal & General Investment Management.  There are just too many fires out there at the moment, which need to be quenched,  he added.  The assumption will be that the pegs continue to hold but it's another part of that matrix that becomes uncertain.  South Africa's rand snapped a four-day winning streak to weaken 0.6 percent against the dollar. Turkey's lira extended losses for a second day, slipping 0.5 percent, while Mexico's peso retreated after jumping nearly 2 percent on Monday, after the governing party clinched a key seat in a state election. However, China's yuan firmed against the dollar after the official midpoint was fixed at a near-seven-month high, shrugging off the central bank's massive $73 billion cash injection into the financial system to ensure liquidity.

Interviews with more than a dozen people familiar with the practice -- including prominent tycoons, wealth managers, lawyers and current and former officials -- suggest a swathe of Russia's national wealth is now in the hands of a new class of semi-exiled oligarchs, who keep bases in their homeland but escape its tax net by spending fewer than 183 days a year there.  You can scold them, call them unpatriotic, but the fact remains: the budget has lost out,  Vladimir Potanin, one of Russia's ten richest men, told Reuters about the practice. Potanin, co-owner of Arctic mining giant Norilsk Nickel, said he has remained a tax resident of Russia but watched as many of his peers moved out in response to the 2014 law. Two other people on Forbes Magazine's list of the 100 richest Russians told Reuters they had given up Russian residency to escape the law, speaking on condition that they not be identified to avoid hurting their Russian business dealings. Two more declined to say whether they had done so, but, like Potanin, said they also knew many fellow oligarchs who had. No official data has been made public on how many people have given up Russian residency to escape the law, or the overall size of the assets they have shielded from Russian tax jurisdiction through the practice. But Russian law firm Egorov, Puginsky, Afanasiev and Partners said it had conducted a survey of around 300 wealthy Russians and found as many as 40 percent of those with offshore companies had given up residency in Russia. Another 9 percent transferred the assets to relatives who are not tax residents. The law, popularly known in Russia as  de-offshorizatsia , requires all Russian taxpayers to declare their interest in offshore companies they control, on which they can then become liable to paying tax in Russia. It is similar to the standard practice in most western countries, but represented a change for Russia, where previously taxpayers could hold interests in companies abroad without declaring them. The change was a high-profile initiative of President Vladimir Putin, widely interpreted as a way to force Russians to do their patriotic duty by investing in their homeland. While there is no suggestion that it is illegal to avoid the law's requirements by giving up Russian residency, those who have done so told Reuters they accepted they were thwarting the law's aim. In response to Reuters questions, Russia's economy ministry said the de-offshorization law was in line with global practice. It said improving the investment climate was a government priority, with positive results, as demonstrated by Russia's improved ranking in the World Bank's ease of Doing Business index. Russia is now ranked 40th, up from 92nd in 2014. The Kremlin declined to comment. The finance ministry did not reply to a request for comment by the time of publication. In response to a list of questions, the tax service said the number of tax cases it was pursuing against Russians with foreign tax exposure was rising, but it did not directly address the questions. The impact of tax exiles giving up Russian residency is heightened because so much of the country's wealth is concentrated in the hands of relatively few people. According to Forbes, the 200 richest Russians have $460 billion in wealth, equivalent to nearly a third of Russia's nominal GDP.  People are forced to decide: do they keep their business in Russia or become citizens of the world and take their assets offshore,  said Konstantin Korishchenko, a former deputy head of the Russian central bank. A former official who has kept close ties to the Kremlin and talks often to Russian oligarchs said that by his estimate a third of Russia's top 500 businesspeople had left the country over the past three years, in part because of the new law.

The first thing that entrepreneurs say is that there is a big sense of mistrust: mistrust toward each other, mistrust towards the state,  said Andrei Sharonov, dean of the Moscow School of Management, Skolkovo, which offers an MBA program. Sitting on the leather sofa in his office in one of Moscow's most prestigious commercial addresses, one of the tycoons who gave up his residency told Reuters he made the move reluctantly. Leaving his homeland for most of the year was a wrench. But because of the investment climate in Russia, he and his partners were looking for buyers for their Russian businesses and focusing instead on international holdings, he said. Slideshow (7 Images) I would stay here and would continue paying taxes here if it was not for this law,  the businessman told Reuters.  It's impossible now.  He now spends his time mostly in a European Union country where his family has settled some time ago, or traveling to meetings around the world. Such a lifestyle, he said, has become common among his peers since the law was passed:  Lots of people lived here and paid tax. Now they don't.  Another Russian businessman, a billionaire who also gave up his Russian residency over the de-offshorization law, told Reuters he and fellow tycoons were worried that it could be followed by further measures, tougher on businesspeople. After three years of deep recession, Russia's economy is stabilizing but has not yet returned to the steady growth needed to begin making up lost ground. The de-offshorization law is one of several factors discouraging investment in Russia, said Chris Weafer a senior partner at Russia-focussed consultancy Macro-Advisory Ltd.  It’s completely unrealistic to talk about raising growth rates to 4 percent, as Russian officials hope, without a sharp increase in inward investment,  he said. Businesspeople who spoke to Reuters said complying with the new rules meant they incurred hefty fees to lawyers and accountants to audit their offshore assets and prepare tax returns, they had to deal with a mountain of paperwork, and at the end risked having to paying more tax. Several said privacy was also an issue, in a country where vendors at flea markets sell CDs purported to contain leaked information from the tax authorities' databases. In the law firm's survey, almost two third of respondents said that they or their clients had encountered problems with leaks of confidential information from state services. Ultimately, people do not trust the authorities to keep their information safe, said the businessman on the Forbes list of 100 richest Russians who did not reveal whether he had given up his residency.  No one wants to show the money.

The IPO will be the biggest of its kind on the Budapest bourse for several years, giving a shot in the arm to a market currently dominated by four blue-chip stocks. Waberer's is one of Europe's biggest haulage businesses with a fleet of more than 3,500 vehicles, and the IPO could make it the fifth largest company on the bourse. The IPO will comprise an offering of new ordinary shares and also existing shares held by CEE Transport Holding BV. Waberer's did not disclose how many existing shares would be sold, but said after the IPO it expected its free float - the proportion of shares traded on the bourse - to be at least 50 percent. The company said it would use around 32 million euros of the proceeds to help fund the acquisition of Link, with the rest used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The offering will include a private placement to institutional investors and a public offering in Hungary.  This is the right time to move forward with our growth strategy ... We see great opportunities in the growing European road transportation industry,  Ferenc Lajko, Waberer's chief executive, said in a statement. Waberer's signed a deal to buy Link in May. The Polish firm has four bases in Poland and one in Belgium. Monika Kiss, an analyst at brokerage Equilor, said Waberer's size meant it could attract interest from foreign investors. She added Waberer's faced challenges in foreign markets due to Britain's move to leave the European Union, border controls and a rise in administrative costs, though falling fuel prices and the Hungarian and European economic recovery were a boost. In 2016, Waberer's made 572.4 million euros in revenues. The company is indirectly controlled by funds advised by Mid Europa Partners, a financial investor. Shares held by those funds will be sold via CEE Transport Holding BV, Waberer's said. $1 = 0.8890 euros Reporting by Krisztina Than and Sandor Peto; Editing by Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/waberer-ipo-idUSL8N1J31GU"},

The pound has tended to react positively to signs that Prime Minister Theresa May's party would win the snap election since she called it seven weeks ago, as investors bet that a strong majority would translate into a better bargaining position in exit talks with the European Union, which begin this month. But after hitting eight-month highs above $1.30 in mid-May, sterling fell to as low as $1.2770 by the end of the month, as polls showed the race tightening between the Conservatives and the left-wing Labour opposition, which wants to increase public spending and is viewed by markets as less business-friendly. It has since recovered, though, climbing back above $1.29 on Monday after an ICM poll carried out from June 2 to June 4 showed the Conservatives with an 11 point lead over Labour. While that was down from a 12 point in the same poll a week earlier, it was a wide enough margin to soothe investors' nerves over the possibility of a hung parliament. Another poll later on Monday from Survation for ITV television put the Conservatives' lead at just 1 percentage point, but other polls have put it as high as 12 points.  When you’ve got a poll that shows an 11-point lead three days before the election, that’s sizeable,  said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel.  If the polls were really tight - all of them, consistently - then you would have more uncertainty. But the balance is now tilted towards the view that we’re going to get a Conservative majority, so now it’s just a question mark of the size of that majority.  Sterling peaked as high as $1.2951 on Tuesday against a broadly weaker dollar, its highest in 12 days, before edging back to trade up 0.1 percent on the day by 0850 GMT at $1.2923. Against the euro, sterling was up 0.2 percent at 87.06 pence . One-week sterling-dollar implied volatility - a hedge against price swings in the currency - was at 12.5 percent, near its highest levels since Jan. 17, when May set out her Brexit strategy.  Yes, the UK election is still something which markets are still worrying about, but one thing which is pretty much certain within the UK elections is that there is no (Brexit) U-turn on the cards,  wrote ThinkMarket analysts in a research note.  Therefore, political risk is somewhat a limited factor.  (Editing by Kevin Liffey)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-sterling-open-idUSL8N1J3186"},

Retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro increased by 0.1 percent in April from March, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said, slightly below the average market expectation of a 0.2 percent rise. Year-on-year, the volume of retail sales grew 2.5 percent, higher than the 2.3 percent rise forecast by economists polled by Reuters. The monthly rise in April was offset by a downward revision of March data to a 0.2 percent rise from a previously estimated 0.3 percent increase.  The year-on-year growth of sales for March was revised up to 2.5 percent from the 2.3 percent estimated earlier by Eurostat. Despite the revision and lower-than-expected growth, it was the fourth consecutive monthly rise, a sign that shoppers seem so far to have been unaffected by the higher inflation in the bloc. It stood at 1.9 percent in April, before falling to 1.4 percent in May, according to Eurostat's flash estimates. Retail sales increased mostly for food, drinks and tobacco products in the month containing Easter, with a 0.6 percent month-on-month rise. Consumers reduced by 0.4 percent their purchases of non-food products, a wide category including clothes and footwear.  Retail sales also went down by 0.8 percent on the month for car fuel, as oil prices increased in April. Among the largest economies of the euro zone, sales went down by 0.2 percent on the month in Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, and by 0.1 percent in France, while they rose by 0.6 percent in Spain. April data were not available for Italy.

Prime Minister Theresa May called the election scheduled for Thursday to give herself a stronger hand in negotiating the country’s departure from the European Union. But she and her main opponent, Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn, have largely avoided any discussion of the trade-offs involved. May’s government has already ditched the rose-tinted versions of Brexit put forward by campaigners in last year’s referendum. Britain will leave the EU single market and customs union. It will therefore need to negotiate the outlines of a new deal before the end of March 2019. Any agreement will involve compromises about trade, contributions to EU coffers, and regulation of industries like drugs and financial services. Whatever shape those take, Britain’s economic relationship with the EU will face greater friction. Failure to reach a deal would be the worst outcome. Most UK exports would need to be checked before crossing the border. British lorry drivers might no longer be allowed on Europe’s motorways. And that’s just physical goods. More than a quarter of UK services exports to the EU would be lost, JPMorgan reckons. The campaign has skipped around these dangers. May says she intends to make Brexit a success, without any further explanation, while insisting she is also prepared to walk away from the negotiations. Corbyn has been less adversarial, but also dodged hard questions. One possibility is that, by being vague, May has retained the flexibility to make concessions to the EU. A bigger majority would then allow her to push a compromise through parliament. Currency markets appear to share that view: sterling rose after the election was called, but has dipped as opinion polls showed May’s lead narrowing. Yet any variety of Brexit almost certainly means lower growth – particularly if May keeps her renewed vow to curb immigration. UK economic output is about 9 percent higher in real terms than a decade ago, according to the International Monetary Fund. But GDP per head is up just 2 percent. If the population stops growing, potential output does too. Voters are ill-prepared for this outcome. Brexit will be just one of a range of factors influencing their choice when they go to the polls. But whoever wins will have to deal with a disappointed electorate when reality dawns.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The government press office could not be reached for comment on the reports carried by a number of websites. One site, Gazeta.uz., said Azimov would now run the state export-import insurance company, marking a major demotion from his role running the economy and finance. Azimov was once seen as a political heavyweight with whom President Shavkat Mirziyoyev effectively shared power following the death of veteran leader Islam Karimov last year. Two news websites, Kun.uz and Gazeta.uz, said deputy finance minister Jamshid Kuchkarov would replace Azimov as deputy PM. Diplomatic and business sources told Reuters that Azimov was part of a ruling triumvirate which also included state security boss Rustam Inoyatov. In April, however, sources familiar with the government said Mirziyoyev had moved to consolidate his power by sidelining Azimov and personally overseeing a program of cautious economic change. That effectively leaves Mirziyoyev and Inoyatov, head of the state security service SNB, as the two men sharing power in Uzbekistan, Central Asia's most populous nation, potentially further centralizing decision-making.

Hong Kong, at the mouth of China's Pearl River Delta, is one of the world’s top global transit hubs for endangered species and their products, like ivory, shark fin, pangolin and rosewood. Shark fin and pangolin are considered delicacies in China and the scales of pangolin, one of the most widely trafficked wild animals in the world, are used in traditional Chinese medicine. The hearing, held in the legislature, was marked by a testy standoff between traders, who argue their business is legal, and conservationists who say Hong Kong’s prime role is pushing elephants toward extinction. The former British colony has lagged behind other places, including China, in implementing tighter regulations, or bans,  on trading of ivory and shark fin. The United States, Singapore and China have banned the ivory trade and the mainland will close down all such operations by the end of this year. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, has only timetabled a ban by 2021.  If you are to be in Africa today, you can see how people are suffering. I am pleading with you this trade should come to an end,  Josias Mungabwa, a former wildlife crime investigator with the Zambian Wildlife Authority Investigations and Intelligence Unit, said. Activists, seeking to ban elephant ivory trade, protest outside the Legislative Council in Hong Kong, China June 6, 2017.Bobby YipHong Kong has the largest retail market for ivory with 90 percent of consumers from the mainland. The trade has been active for more than 150 years with ivory made into jewelry and sculptures.  Groups including the World Wildlife Fund state that loopholes in Hong Kong's regulatory system mean that traders can use a stockpile of legal ivory as a front while they smuggle illegal ivory to unsuspecting buyers. Erik Mararv, manager of Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, said 100 elephants are poached a day while 1,000 rangers have been killed over the last 10 years trying to protect them. Slideshow (3 Images)Ahead of the hearing, activists waving graphic placards showing dead elephants were accompanied by a giant inflatable elephant and a Senegalese drumming band which drowned out the shouts from jeering ivory traders. Later in the week, a protest outside a famous restaurant by the city’s trademark harbor is planned against the shark fin trade. A study from Hong Kong’s Shark Foundation released on May 31 showed large restaurant groups were serving shark fin from endangered species like the dusky shark and the silky shark. Elizabeth Quat, a legislator who has lobbied the government to strengthen the combat of wildlife smuggling, said she hoped an official bill to ban the import of ivory would be introduced by the end of this year.  Today we are reaching the last battle... It is the last chance in our generation to save such a beautiful species,  she said.

A State Department spokeswoman confirmed Rank's departure, but said she was unable to verify Twitter posts that said he resigned as he felt unable to deliver a formal notification to China of the U.S. decision last week to quit the agreement.  He has retired from the foreign service,  said Anna Richey-Allen, a spokeswoman for the department's East Asia Bureau.  Mr. Rank has made a personal decision. We appreciate his years of dedicated service to the State Department.  Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, President Donald Trump's pick as the next U.S. ambassador to Beijing, is expected to take up the post later this month. A tweet from China expert John Pomfret quoted unnamed sources as saying that Rank had resigned as he could not support Trump's decision last week to withdraw from the Paris agreement. Another tweet from Pomfret said Rank called a town hall meeting to announce his decision to embassy staff and explained that he could not deliver a diplomatic note informing the Chinese government of the U.S. decision. A senior U.S. official confirmed the account given in the tweets but added that after Rank announced his intention to retire on Monday in Beijing, he was told by the State Department to leave his post immediately. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. On June 1, the U.S. State Department accepted the resignation of its top personnel officer, who had been among its  few remaining senior Obama administration political appointees, another U.S. official said. Arnold Chacon had served as the director general of the foreign service and director of human resources. FILE PHOTO: A paramilitary police officer guards the entrance to the U.S. embassy in Beijing April 30, 2012.Petar Kujundzic/File PhotoThe official said Chacon had tendered his resignation when Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, along with all presidential appointees, who serve at the pleasure of the president and secretary of state. The acceptance of Chacon's resignation was first reported by the DiploPundit website. It was not immediately clear whether he would be offered another post at the department.  Other than Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, his deputy John Sullivan and Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Tom Shannon, the third-ranking U.S. diplomat, most of the State Department's senior posts are currently vacant or filled by acting officials. Chacon could not immediately be reached for comment.  Contacted by Reuters for comment, Rank, a career foreign service officer who took over the post of deputy chief of mission in Beijing in January 2016, referred all questions to the U.S. embassy. Jonathan Fritz, the embassy's economics councilor, would serve as chargé in his place, Richey-Allen said. Rank had been with the department for 27 years and served as the political councilor at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2012. Trump's announcement on Thursday that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, saying it would undermine the U.S. economy and cost jobs, drew anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry.  The world has paid attention to the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris agreement , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing on Tuesday, but added that personnel changes were the United States'  internal affairs .

The government issued the 5-year bond with a coupon of 7 percent, with Hong Kong-based BoCom International Holdings Co Ltd acting as the sole global coordinator for the offering.  The government thinks this is a fair coupon rate for international investors whilst remaining affordable for the Maldives. It is in fact a robust rate if we look at similar recent offerings,  a government spokesperson said in a statement emailed to Reuters. The comments come after the main opposition party described the coupon rate on the debut offering as high and that it could force up debt costs for private-sector borrowers. Responding, the government disputed that view.  Inaugural offerings command a premium – given they are an untested proposition on the international market. The Maldivian economy continues to grow stronger quarter on quarter. Given this, there is no reason why the Maldives' coupon rate will not go down on our next issuance.  The Maldives' economy is expected to grow 4.7 percent this year, faster than an estimated 3.9 percent last year, according to official forecasts. The government said the  successful debut in the international bond market will open the door for public and private companies in the Maldives to tap into international markets  and diversify financing options for its corporates.  The bond will open up innovative financing options for resort developers, especially newer local companies to reach investors,  it added. Though the Maldives has been mired in political unrest for years, the bond was twice oversubscribed last week. Asian investors bought 83 percent of the offering, with the rest bought by Europeans, official data showed.

The country's No. 1 property developer's unveiling of a plan to redeem all of its perpetual bonds has added to positive momentum driven by an imminent backdoor listing for most of its real estate assets in mainland China, fresh capital from strategic investors as well as share buybacks. The dizzy ascent of its stock - which has more than tripled in value since the end of last year - has so far trampled and continues to threaten a swathe of short-sellers. They are betting that the company's debt, which stood at $78 billion at the end of last year, will precipitate a sharp correction.  Investors were shorting Evergrande because it has a lot of off-balance sheet items, which is true but Evergrande has plenty of money to support its own shares, so the short sellers are being wiped out,  said Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities Ltd.  Unless the shortsellers have more money than Evergrande or the company has used up its cash, it's very hard to compete with them.  The shares climbed as much as 9 percent to HK$17.36 before ending trade 4.8 percent higher. Evergrande was one of the most heavily shorted Hong Kong stocks over the past month. As of June 2, the most recent date for which data is available, 4.47 percent of Evergrande's outstanding shares were out on loan, according to research firm Markit. Shares on loan are a proxy for short selling. Evergrande, which has developed thousands of middle class homes in China and owns the country's top football team, said late on Monday that it plans to redeem all of its perpetual bonds, after repaying 71 percent ahead of time. That represents a significant saving in interest costs. The perpetual bonds, which have an average coupon of 10 percent and have been a target of much investor criticism, cost Evergrande 10.6 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in interest last year. It has 29 billion yuan of perpetual bonds outstanding. Morgan Stanley has estimated Evergrande's gearing could drop to 183 percent from 432 percent after repaying the perpetual bonds. But some analysts said it was not clear how redemption was being funded. Additional debt to replace the perpetual bonds - classed as equity - could actually raise Evergrande's gearing.  I suspect the redemption of all the perps is through refinancing with other debt, and not a de-leveraging story,  said Yin Chin Cheong, Singapore-based credit analyst with CreditSights. For now, however, most analysts say market sentiment is set to be driven by the Shenzhen backdoor listing, which Evergrande has valued at 198 billion yuan ($29 billion). The listing, which comes amid a red-hot property market that has pushed up Evergrande's sales, aims to take advantage of higher valuations commanded on the mainland due to a large pool of retail investors. It will also make it easier for Evergrande to raise funds.

In London, remote work is enjoying strengthening tailwinds from wider cultural, political and technological forces. Firms that adopt this are able to downsize expensive office space, the effect of which on central London office markets could see as much as 25% eventually being shaved off aggregate value. Fitch does not expect major credit implications, however, as most lenders will have lead time to adjust underwriting before the full effects would be expected to feed through. In our 10-year  disruptive case  analysis we assess the impact of 332,500 central London employees moving into shared workspaces on a routine basis. Such a transition, we believe, would be staggered by the rate of lease roll-offs among employers amenable to changing work patterns. Without a sudden reduction in occupancy, central London office markets are likely to remain under-supplied, underpinning very high rents - and therefore the basic push factor out of the centre. This also suggests London's central business district (CBD) could become gradually more available for uses besides offices. Many service sector firms are already adopting flexible office arrangements to reduce fixed costs, facilitate expansion or consolidation and cater for growth in project-based contingent work. Economic uncertainty and changing accounting standards both favour lease flexibility associated with third-party flexible workspace. As firms in central London downsize requirements, headquarters are being designed on smart, flexible formats. So-called  agile  formats catering to hot-desking, bookable rooms and shared facilities are being incorporated into some of the new grade A office developments. The main barriers to remote working are cultural, not technological. Cloud-based solutions, IP-based business phones and an array of mobile devices supporting secure network access technology all cater to remote work. Yet few large firms have promoted remote work at scale, with the UK lagging its European peers in rates of routine homeworking. Shared workspace can overcome some concerns with homeworking, among both employers and employees. And as millennials rise up the ranks we predict business culture will evolve, lowering cultural barriers. The range of potential benefits from working nearer home is wide. Commuting places a great strain on London's transport, air quality and housing, which a suburban model of shared workspaces can ease. Moreover, local economies would be further boosted by greater disposable income and leisure time being spent in the suburbs. The extra 20 million-25 million square feet of offices needed in our projections or 1.5x-2x London's Victoria office market, reversing decades of suburban attrition, would act as a direct economic stimulus besides  crowding in  local retail and leisure investment. We believe local authorities will play a broadly supportive role in this roll-out. For employees, routine work from shared workspaces near home offers the prospect of far lower commuting times and costs. While housing in more remote locations should also become more attractive, it should leave the number of residents in inner London broadly unchanged. The market rental premium inner London commands over outlying suburbs would be trimmed, but without a surge in suburban development we do not expect any negative effect on house prices to exceed 10%. Demand for flexible workspace stock is rising, not just in the centre but now also in London's suburban orbital areas. This is driving double-digit yoy growth in supply, and we estimate market share will grow sharply from its current 5%. A scaled-up and distributed workspace model ought to appeal beyond homeworking by providing professional technology and improved facilities while also fulfilling the basic human need for stimulation from face to face interaction. Workspace that offers a range of formats - including traditional B2B serviced offices and cubicles through to B2C membership-based open-plan hot-desking (co-working) - should address most businesses' concerns around data confidentiality. Such hybrid workspace is now seeing an uptick in supply, and as it disperses across London we believe it can attract users outside central London's ranks of freelancers and SMEs.

Insurers are setting up regulated EU subsidiaries in case Britain does not have access to the single market after Brexit so as to allow them to continue to operate across the bloc. Below are insurers' plans for EU subsidiaries (in alphabetical order): Admiral British motor insurer Admiral Group Plc said last year it could move its European business to Ireland or another country. It said earlier this year it was looking at a large number of locations and expected to make a decision within two months. Aig U.S. insurer AIG said in March it will set up a European subsidiary in Luxembourg, in addition to its European headquarters in London. Aviva Aviva is converting its Irish life and general insurance branches to regulated subsidiaries to meet the needs of its Irish insurance customers after Brexit. Beazley Lloyd's of London insurer Beazley Plc said last year it had filed an application with the Central Bank of Ireland to get approval for its Irish reinsurance business to become a European insurance company. The firm said in February it will hire additional staff in Ireland. Chesnara Chesnara Plc, an insurance-focused takeover specialist, already has an insurance company in the Netherlands but could move its headquarters there, depending on the regulatory environment in Britain after negotiations to leave the EU. Cna Hardy CNA Hardy will set up a new European subsidiary in Luxembourg to allow it to operate across the EU after Britain leaves the bloc, the specialist commercial insurer, which is part of CNA Financial Corp, said. Fm Global U.S. commercial property insurer FM Global is planning a European hub in Luxembourg following Britain's decision to leave the bloc, it said last month. Hiscox Lloyd's of London underwriter Hiscox Ltd will establish a new subsidiary in Luxembourg to underwrite its retail business in Europe, it said in May. Lancashire Lancashire said in May it has options to write EU business out of its Bermuda headquarters or via Lloyd's of London's Brussels base. The insurer added it was in no hurry to set up a EU base and saw itself staying in Britain for the foreseeable future. Legal & General British insurer Legal & General said in May it would move some of its investment management operations to Ireland to ensure it can continue to serve its customers after Brexit. Lloyd's of London Lloyd's of London, an integral part of the British business scene since the 17th century, has chosen Brussels as the site for its EU subsidiary, it said in March. Markel U.S. insurer Markel plans to apply for regulatory approval to set up a European Union subsidiary in Munich. Ms Amlin Japanese-owned insurer MS Amlin operates under the  Societas Europaea  structure. That makes it relatively easy to move to a different EU jurisdiction if needed, subject to regulatory approval. Neon Neon Underwriting Ltd may set up a Dublin business to sell insurance policies throughout the EU if Britain loses access to the single market, chief executive of the specialist Lloyd's of London insurer said in December. Qbe QBE Insurance Group will set up a subsidiary in Brussels to preserve its ability to operate across the EU, the Australian business insurer said. Royal London British life insurer Royal London Mutual Insurance Society plans to turn its Irish business into a regulated subsidiary, it said in March. Rsa RSA is planning a subsidiary in Luxembourg to act as the headquarters of its EU operations following Britain's decision to leave the bloc. It said it chose Luxembourg because it had  multi-national expertise , was  strategically located within RSA’s existing EU branch network  and had an experienced regulator. Standard Life British insurer and asset manager Standard Life said in May it was likely to choose Dublin for its EU hub.

A fall in French 10-year yields to their lowest since early January stood out as it came after a vote for lawmakers representing French who live abroad that was another indication that President Emmanuel Macron's party is set to win a majority in the parliamentary election this month. Europe's benchmark German Bund yields fell to their lowest level in nearly six weeks at 0.262 percent, while Spanish equivalents dropped 3 bps to 1.55 percent, just above a four-month low of 1.50 percent.  There is a general risk aversion theme going on,  Mizuho's head of euro rates strategy Peter Chatwell said. Oil prices have shed around 8 percent over the last 10 days and were holding below $50 a barrel on Tuesday on concerns as a political rift between Qatar and several Arab states threatens to undermine efforts by OPEC to tighten the market. That collapse has conspired to erode inflation expectations in the euro zone. The five-year, five-year forward rate - a key measure of inflation in the bloc - has slid more than 20 bps since the start of the year. At below 1.6 percent, it remains well below the ECB's near 2 percent inflation target. That is partly why investors are anticipating the ECB to strike a cautious tone at its policy meeting on Thursday, even though it is set to take a more benign view of the economy and potentially close the door to further stimulus. Adding to the political tension, former FBI director James Comey is due to make a testimony before U.S. congress on Thursday. He might talk about his conversations with U.S. President Donald Trump about an investigation into former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials. Investors see this as a distraction for Trump who they are banking on to reflate the global economy with ambitious spending plans. Greek Relief There was some relief for Greek bonds after IMF chief Christine Lagarde offered a compromise to Europe on debt relief that should allow the release of aid next month and avoid the potential for default. The IMF believes Greece needs a debt haircut, which Germany rejects. But Lagarde told German newspaper Handelsblatt it could agree a deal whereby it stays on board in the bailout but not pay out further aid until debt relief measures are clarified. This could allow euro zone finance ministers to give the go-ahead for their next payment to Greece at their meeting on June 15, funds they need to repay some 7 billion euros of debt maturing in July. Yield moves, however, were minimal with two- and 10-year benchmarks shedding around 3 basis points. Editing by Janet Lawrence","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds-idUSL8N1J31CZ"},

Rupee forwards were active on Tuesday, with spot-next forwards trading at 152.90/95 per dollar at 0803 GMT, edging down from Monday's close of 152.85/95.  Some banks were buying dollars in smaller quantity. We do not see much importer demand until September. We also see state banks buying dollars when they trade around 152.80/85,  a currency dealer said, asking not to be named.  We don't know if state banks are buying for central bank.  The rupee has been under pressure after the central bank governor last month said the bank would allow gradual depreciation of the currency. The central bank has set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year. The spot rupee, which the central bank had fixed at 152.50 since May 5, did not trade on Tuesday. Foreign investors bought a net 740 million rupees ($4.86 million) worth of government securities in the week ended May 31. They have sold a net 41.33 billion rupees worth of securities so far this year. The dull trade came as investors assessed the extent of damage to the economy from the recent floods and landslides. The country's main agricultural crops - tea and rubber - were hit by the worst torrential rains in 14 years. Damage to agricultural exports would put pressure on the rupee, currency dealers said. The hospitality and manufacturing sectors are likely to be the worst hit, analysts said. However, dealers said there was some optimism over expected inflows in the form of international assistance, which could help offset potential downward pressure on the local currency. Dealers said the aid inflows could help the rupee, but the central bank will have to tighten interest rates to curb unnecessary credit growth and inflationary pressure. The floods could hurt overall economic growth and also widen the government's budget deficit with high infrastructure spending, dealers said. Sri Lankan shares were down 0.08 percent at 6,671.22 as of 0819 GMT. Turnover stood at 394.7 million rupees ($2.58 million).

James Comey, former head of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, is due to appear before a Senate committee for the first time on Thursday. Comey was fired by President Donald Trump in May while leading a probe into alleged Russian meddling in last year's U.S. election.                   The events all have the potential to boost the safe-haven appeal of bullion, which is often used as an investment option during times of political and financial uncertainty.       Much will, of course, depend on the U.S. dollar. However,  with event risk in the form of this Thursday's ECB rate decision and the UK general election, one would expect the safe haven bid to be alive and well as the week progresses,  said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA.      Spot gold        rose 0.8 percent to $1,289.20 per ounce, as of 0805 GMT. Earlier in the session, it hit a peak of $1,289.67 an ounce, its highest level since April 19.      U.S. gold futures         climbed 0.7 percent to $1,291.8 an ounce.       Generally light positioning and numerous upcoming geopolitical events should continue to underpin demand for the metal, with targets extending to the 2017 high around $1,295 and the psychological level of $1,300 above this,  Sam Laughlin, senior precious metals trader at MKS, said in a note.     In Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labour Party has narrowed to just 1 percentage point, according to a poll by Survation for ITV television on Monday.  The vote is now expected to be much tighter than previously predicted.                    A decent win for the incumbent should ease any geopolitical fears. A hung parliament or a move towards the Labour Party could lead to some uncertainty fuelling gold prices,  said National Australia Bank analyst John Sharma.      Meanwhile, ECB policymakers are set to take a more benign view of the economy when they meet on Thursday and will even discuss dropping some of their pledges to ramp up stimulus if needed, four sources with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters last week.                   In the wider markets, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan                 fell 0.3 percent, while the dollar index touched a seven-month low against a basket of major currencies.                         Among other precious metals, palladium        marked its strongest since Sept. 11, 2014, at $850 an ounce, and silver        hit a high of $17.682 an ounce, its highest since April 25.      Platinum        gained as much as 0.8 pct at $958.05.

A plunge in sterling risk reversals - options used to hedge against or bet on falls in the pound - underlined the nerves over Britain's election on Thursday, even if the pound itself was steady after a 3 percent fall in the past month . A European Central Bank meeting and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony to a Senate committee are due on the same day, supporting flows of money into the traditional security of the yen.  People are thinking what are the events we need to worry about, and with the things all coinciding on Thursday, a bit of risk has been taken off the table,  said Jeremy Stretch, a strategist with CIBC in London.  It's a function of Japanese investors who are just deciding against the backdrop of the spreads (between Japanese and U.S. government bonds).  The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 109.56 yen its lowest since April 21. The euro lost 0.8 percent 123.35 yen. With the Bank of Japan keeping 10-year Japanese bond yields pinned to zero, the dollar-yen exchange rate has been closely correlated for the past year with any shifts in U.S. 10-year Treasuries.  It is worth pointing out that the US 10-year is hovering above the key technical level at 2.13 percent,  Rabobank analysts said in a morning note to clients.  It must hold to prevent further retracement, with the psychological level of 2 percent as the next potential target if cleared.  Comey, the FBI director fired by U.S. President Donald Trump in May, will be grilled by the Senate Intelligence Committee on whether Trump tried to get him to back off an investigation into alleged ties between the president's 2016 campaign and Russia. The threats to Trump and some of his senior advisors the affair has added to market doubts over the administration's ability to deliver a promised boost to growth through tax cuts and infrastructure spending. While U.S. economic data has worsened, in Europe it has been improving and expectations have grown for some sort of change in the European Central Bank's rhetoric this week. Most traders, however, say it may now by difficult for that to top the expectations priced into the euro itself.  Central banks seem to be very good at leaking everything before the event,  said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment with currency fund Millennium Global in London.  The euro looks stronger than most rate differentials would suggest. I think all expectations for Thursday are in the price.

As part of pledges made to help secure a global climate change pact in Paris in 2015, China said it would complete the launch of the nationwide emissions trading platform this year. The country has already launched seven pilot regional carbon exchanges that force firms to buy permits to cover their emissions. It is planning to create an integrated national trading system covering as many as 10,000 enterprises in sectors like steel, power generation and papermaking this year.   The market was originally expected to launch in the first half of 2017, but regulators have struggled to deal with a variety of problems, including the valuation of permits trading on existing pilot exchanges, as well as data accuracy and transparency problems in some industrial sectors. The researcher with an official think-tank, who advises the government on carbon market issues, said the launch was being held back by gaps in legislation as well as incomplete data in sectors like papermaking.  The researcher, who did not want to disclose his name, also said there was not yet a strong consensus on how carbon emission quotas should be allocated. Authorities are worried that unreliable data in some industrial sectors would undermine the integrity of the market and allow firms to game the system.  Officials with the climate change department at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which regulates China's carbon market, told a meeting on Tuesday that progress on the national exchange was still going smoothly and was on schedule to launch this year. Xie Ji, director general of the department, said the launch was likely to include only the sectors that currently have strong statistical foundations.  China never promised the market will launch in the first half of 2017,  said Zhang Xiliang, director at the Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy at Tsinghua University.   We are still actively preparing for the launch and are confident that it will be launched in the next few months,  he added.   Market regulators have also been trying to figure out what to do with large amounts of carbon credits, known as CCERs, generated by an NDRC scheme aimed at funding projects that cut emissions. Amid concerns about oversupply, sources say the credits are likely to be excluded from the nationwide trading scheme in the initial phase.

As part of pledges made to help secure a global climate change pact in Paris in 2015, China said it would complete the launch of the nationwide emissions trading platform this year. The country has already launched seven pilot regional carbon exchanges that force firms to buy permits to cover their emissions. It is planning to create an integrated national trading system covering as many as 10,000 enterprises in sectors like steel, power generation and papermaking this year.   The market was originally expected to launch in the first half of 2017, but regulators have struggled to deal with a variety of problems, including the valuation of permits trading on existing pilot exchanges, as well as data accuracy and transparency problems in some industrial sectors. The researcher with an official think-tank, who advises the government on carbon market issues, said the launch was being held back by gaps in legislation as well as incomplete data in sectors like papermaking.  The researcher, who did not want to disclose his name, also said there was not yet a strong consensus on how carbon emission quotas should be allocated. Authorities are worried that unreliable data in some industrial sectors would undermine the integrity of the market and allow firms to game the system.  Officials with the climate change department at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which regulates China's carbon market, told a meeting on Tuesday that progress on the national exchange was still going smoothly and was on schedule to launch this year. Xie Ji, director general of the department, said the launch was likely to include only the sectors that currently have strong statistical foundations.  China never promised the market will launch in the first half of 2017,  said Zhang Xiliang, director at the Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy at Tsinghua University.   We are still actively preparing for the launch and are confident that it will be launched in the next few months,  he added.   Market regulators have also been trying to figure out what to do with large amounts of carbon credits, known as CCERs, generated by an NDRC scheme aimed at funding projects that cut emissions. Amid concerns about oversupply, sources say the credits are likely to be excluded from the nationwide trading scheme in the initial phase.  Meanwhile, California on Tuesday said it would cooperate with China on clean technology, emissions trading and other  climate-positive  opportunities as it bids to fill the gap left after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord last week.

The affirmation reflects SIH's credit profile from its toll-road operations and logistics business at a 'BBB-' standalone rating, with a single-notch uplift for implied support from its 44.3% shareholder, Shenzhen's municipal government. SIH's stable toll-road operation is contributed by its 50.9%-owned Shenzhen Expressway Company Limited (SZE; BBB/Stable). SIH aims to increase its logistics business exposure in the medium term. We believe this carries execution risk and has a higher risk profile compared with the toll-road business. SIH's exposure in two property projects - the Meilin Checkpoint Urban Renewable Project (MCUR) and Qianhai project is credit neutral, as limited additional capex is required since SIH does not plan to develop these projects on its own. Instead, SIH may divest a portion of its exposure in MCUR in the immediate term. KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Toll-Road Operations: SIH's toll-road operations accounted for over 70% of its 2016 operating profit and remain its key earning contributor, with the majority of earnings coming from SZE. Fitch expects cash generation from the expressway operations to remain strong, driven by SZE's acquisition of Yichang Expressway and organic growth of the existing expressways. We also expect a stable regulatory environment for expressway operators, with little negative regulatory changes in the near term. Sustainable Dividend from SZE: We expect SZE to continue providing stable dividends to SIH in the medium-term, provided SZE's financial profile remains strong, despite SZE's active large acquisitions and expansion into the environmental segment. We expect SZE's financial profile to remain at historical levels, with fund flow from operation (FFO) net leverage remaining below 4.0x (2016: 1.1x) and FFO interest coverage above 4.5x (2016: 6.5x). We believe SZE's strong financial profile will enable a moderately increasing dividend flow to SIH. Harvesting from Real Estate Projects: We do not expect SIH to make significant additional investments into its real estate projects, as management has said the majority of capex has been paid and land premium payments have been settled via land swaps, profit sharing and momentary compensation. SIH agreed with Shum Yip Land Company Limited for the joint development of phase one of the Qianhai residential project, which measures at 53,000 square metres in gross floor area. SIH has also classified the MCUR as asset held for sale. We expect SIH to gradually monetise the profits from its Qianhai project as early as 2019, when it is ready for pre-sale. Significant realisation of MCUR may be sooner, given that SIH's directors have approved a plan to dispose of more than 50% of the company's equity interest in the project to third-party real estate developers in 2017. The book value of MCUR is HKD4.4 billion, representing the land premium and original land-use rights. Shenzhen's booming real estate market implies a potential for substantially higher valuation of MCUR than its book value. High Logistics Capex: SIH plans to develop more than 17 integrated logistics hubs across China by 2020, four of which have been completed and became operational in 2016 and another five of which will be completed by end-2017. We estimate SIH will invest more than HKD6 billion of total capex in its logistic business in the next three years. Building the logistic business carries execution risk and the segment has a higher risk profile compared with the toll-road business. If SIH successfully executes the build-up of its logistics business, conservatively, we believe its EBITDA contribution can increase to around HKD600 million in 2019, from around HKD430 million in 2016. Robust Standalone Financial Profile: We view SIH's standalone profile as robust. Its financial profile, excluding SZE, was net-cash positive at end-2016 due to large cash in-flows from the government to compensate for making Longda Expressway toll-free. We expect SIH's elevated capex will require some debt financing. However, interest coverage/dividends (primarily from SZE and Shenzhen Airlines) are likely to remain at over 5.0x for the next two years (2016: ~6.6x).  We also expect SIH's consolidated FFO net leverage to remain below 4.0x (2016: 0.9x) for the next three years, while consolidated FFO interest cover is likely to remain above 4.5x (2016: 6.8x). The weakened credit profile beginning in 2017 also incorporates SZE's major acquisitions and elevated capex programme. SIH's consolidated credit metrics remain within our negative guidelines. Support from Shenzhen Government: SIH has received tangible support from the Shenzhen State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, including a capital injection with the conversion of HKD1.7 billion in convertible notes into equity in 2010 and the extension of the maturity of a CNY863 million shareholder loan in 2008. Fitch has limited the rating uplift to one notch because SIH is mainly operated as a commercial entity, as reflected in its robust 'BBB-' standalone rating, and is less reliant on state support than a typical government policy vehicle. DERIVATION SUMMARY SIH's IDR of 'BBB' reflects its credit profile from its toll-road operations and logistics business at a 'BBB-' standalone rating, with a single-notch uplift for implied support from its 44.3% shareholder, Shenzhen's municipal government. The expressway segment mainly consists of contributions from its 50.9% owned SZE, which translates to a high level of cash leakage to minority shareholders. SIH is also subject to the higher business risk profile of the developing logistics business. However, Fitch believes SZE's stable dividend payout and the strong financial profile of SIH's non-SZE business provide some support to mitigate the aforesaid risks. As such, the standalone 'BBB-' rating is appropriate. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Moderate EBITDA growth from SZE's expressway operations, translating into a stable dividend payout. - Realisation from disposing up to 50% of its equity MCUR in 2017 at book value. - The government buying back four expressways - the Yanba, Yanpai, Nanguang and Longda Expressways - at end-2018. - Total capex of over HKD3.5 billion per year in 2017-2019, roughly half from expressways (mainly the Outer Ring Road Project) and the rest from building out its logistic parks and integrated logistic hubs. - Total acquisitions of more than HKD6 billion in 2017 from SZE, comprised of the Yichang Expressway and Chongqing Derun Environment Co., Ltd. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Successful execution of SIH's expansion strategy for the logistics business, provided SIH's consolidated financial profile remains in line with Fitch's expectations. - An upgrade of SZE's ratings, including an improvement of its credit profile, which will be evident if its FFO interest coverage rises above 6.0x (2016: 6.5x) and its funds from operation (FFO) adjusted net leverage falls below 2.0x (2016: 1.1x) on a sustained basis. - Positive free cash flows at the SIH level, provided there is are no large business risk increases from its non-toll-road operations. - Strengthening of linkages between SIH and the Shenzhen municipal government. Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Weakening of SIH's operating or financial risk profile, such as large debt-funded investments in businesses of a higher risk profile than its established expressway operations. This may be reflected in SIH's consolidated FFO-adjusted net leverage rising above 5.0x (2016: 0.9x). - Downgrade of SZE's ratings, including a deterioration in its credit profile that would be evident in its FFO interest coverage falling below 3.0x and FFO-adjusted net leverage rising above 4.5x for a sustained period. - Adverse developments at SZE that affect SIH's ability to access operating cash flows, such as tighter debt covenants at the project level. - Weakening of linkages between SIH and the Shenzhen municipal government. LIQUIDITY Comfortable Liquidity: SIH's consolidated short-term debt amount to HKD4.8 billion, against HKD9.8 billion of readily available cash.

Our decision to set up a legal entity in Belgium ensures we can provide continuity of service irrespective of the outcome of Brexit negotiations,  Chief Executive Richard Pryce said in a statement. QBE said it already has a branch in the Belgian capital, and will use staff there to take up roles in the newly formed company, which will be operational for 2019 renewals. London will remain as the headquarters of QBE's European business, it said. The Sydney-based insurer employs more than 14,500 people worldwide, including around 1,950 across 16 European countries. Its European division based in London accounted for more than $4 billion in gross written premiums in 2016. QBE's chairman, Marston Becker, told shareholders last month the company had to prepare for the possibility that arrangements permitting UK domiciled insurers to sell to the other 27 EU countries might not be preserved after Brexit.

In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers. For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.

The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark dropped 0.3 percent, falling for a second session while euro zone stocks and blue-chips also fell 0.3 percent. The greatest downward pull came from healthcare stocks however. Swiss drugmaker Roche fell 4.5 percent after investors were disappointed by findings in its Aphinity study for a key breast cancer treatment. Medical products company Convatec fell 4.8 percent after Nordic Capital and Avista sold a 250 million share placing in the stock, raising 805 million pounds ($1.04 billion). A rift in the Middle East between Qatar and neighbours Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain caused oil to fall in choppy trading, weighing on commodities-heavy European markets. Norsk Hydro fell 1.8 percent after saying exports from the Qatalum aluminium plant in Qatar, a joint venture with Qatar Petroleum, were blocked due to the dispute. Basic resource stocks were down 0.6 percent while oil and gas stocks also fell. Spain's troubled Banco Popular hit another record low in choppy trading after Barclays cut its price target on the stock.

In five years, Grab's network has grown from 40 drivers in one country to over 930,000 across 55 cities in seven countries including Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines. The Singapore-based startup raised $750 million in a funding round in September, which sources said valued the firm at over $3 billion. Grab's current investors include Chinese peer Didi Chuxing, China Investment Corp, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp and Vertex Ventures Holdings - a subsidiary of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd.

Shares in Genel, which have fallen more than 92 percent since its peak in 2014, were down 3.2 percent at 84.50 pence in early trading. The oil producer said it would target further investment in Taq Taq, and cautioned that  it remains too early to extrapolate long-term conclusions  from oil field's production trends. Genel co-founder Nathaniel Rothschild quit on Monday, joining co-founder Tony Hayward, and chief financial officer Ben Monaghan, who have announced plans to depart. Hayward, formerly chief executive of BP, said in the company's statement that its board composition is under review. He will retire from the board on Tuesday. Genel shares have plunged after two downgrades to reserves at Taq Taq, failed exploration campaigns in Africa, political unrest in Iraq and a sharp drop in oil prices since 2014. Under Chief Executive Murat Ozgul, who took over from Hayward in 2015, Genel is focused on retrieving money it says it is owed by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) for oil it has sold and on finding a partner to develop two gas fields in the region, with the aim of linking them to neighbouring Turkey.  The economic situation in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq continues to improve,  Hayward said on Tuesday, adding that the KRG has made gross payments of $316 million so far this year. Genel said it has now received oil export payments for 18 consecutive months, adding it expects to continue receiving payments. The company also said its Tawke field in Iraqi Kurdistan continued to perform in line with expectations, while it expects the Peshkabir field, situated west of Tawke, to add to production from the end of 2017. Net production averaged 37,700 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in the year to May 31, with average production from Taq Taq of 23,300 bopd, Genel said.

The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.7 percent, to 3,492.88 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.3 percent to 3,102.13 points. China's economy is likely to have remained on a stable footing in May, buoyed by solid gains in trade and investment as economic ties with the United States take a positive turn and infrastructure spending cushions domestic growth. A Reuters poll of indicators from trade and industrial output to loans and property investment, is expected to show that economic growth held up nicely into the second quarter, defying worries of a sharp slowdown. However, sentiment was dampened after state media reported that the securities regulator would maintain a stable and firm policy regarding new listings, raising concerns among investors that the pace of IPOs would not be rolled back as expected.  Currently, valuations of many listed companies are still quite high, in particular small caps,  said Zhang Qi, an analyst with Haitong Securities. Expectations of more equity supply could weigh on those small-cap stocks, according to many analysts Reuters spoke to. Most sectors gained ground, with consumer stocks leading the gains.

Sheikh Mohammed told the channel that the measures taken against Qatar had an  unprecedented impact  on its citizens and on family relations in the Gulf Arab region, but said Doha will not take counter measures.

Healy didn't wait long to go deep twice again. The designated hitter homered twice and drove in a career-high five runs, powering the A's to a 5-3 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays on Monday night at the Coliseum in the opener of a three-game series.  If he doesn't show up for work today, we're in a little bit of trouble,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  He can hit, and he's semi-acclimating to the DH role now, which he doesn't want to admit he's acclimating to because he wants to be in the field, obviously.  I think the thing that stands out the most to me is the adjustments he's made this year because he's had to go through some struggles, and he's made the adjustments and look how he's swinging again.  On Saturday, Healy went 4-for-4 with the two homers and two doubles, tying a franchise record for the most extra-base hits in a game. He went 2-for-3 on Monday. Healy had 13 home runs in 72 games last season, his first in the major leagues, and he has 13 in 56 games this year. Ten of his 13 homers have come at the Coliseum. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at AthleticsToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatch I'm having good swings, good results right now, but still some things I'm trying to iron out,  Healy said.  So there's room for improvement, but I don't think I feel amazing right now. Just not missing my pitches.  A's left-hander Sean Manaea (5-3) extended his career-high winning streak to four games, holding the Blue Jays to two runs on four hits over six innings. He struck out seven, walked three and threw a career-high 111 pitches. In his past three games, against the New York Yankees, the Cleveland Indians and the Blue Jays, Manaea has allowed three runs on 11 hits with 24 strikeouts and five walks over 20 innings. Healy, who entered the game hitting .383 against left-handers, belted a three-run shot off Blue Jays lefty J.A. Happ in the second inning and a two-run blast off Happ in the fourth.  I don't think (Happ) was that bad other than you take Ryon Healy out of the lineup,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  Unfortunately, you can't do that. He hung in there, got his pitches in, which he definitely needed to do.  Happ (0-4) made his second start since being reinstated after a stint on the disabled list caused by left elbow inflammation. He gave up five runs on four hits over 5 1/3 innings, struck out four, walked two and threw 98 pitches. He fell to 4-1 all-time against Oakland.  They got five runs on two hard-hit balls, so that's not good run prevention from me,  Happ said.  I feel like that's going to change. I feel like I'll be more sharp as we go forward. Frustrating night.  Yonder Alonso went 2-for-4 with a double and a run for the last-place A's, who remained 16 1/2 games behind the Houston Astros in the American League West. Blue Jays first baseman Justin Smoak hit his 15th home run of the season, a solo shot in the eighth that cut Oakland's lead to 5-3. Josh Donaldson, Kevin Pillar and Troy Tulowitzki each doubled for the Blue Jays, who dropped into sole possession of last place in the AL East, six games behind the first-place New York Yankees. A's closer Santiago Casilla pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his ninth save in 11 opportunities. Toronto scored a run in the top of the first inning when Pillar worked a leadoff walk and came home on Donaldson's double down the left field line. Oakland took a 3-1 lead in the second. Khris Davis led off with a walk, Alonso singled to center, and Healy crushed a three-run homer into the left-center-field seats. The blast came on Happ's 0-1 changeup.  He's pretty strong,  Melvin said of Healy.  There's a different sound certain guys make (when they make contact), and when he gets into one, he hits 'em a long way and can do it at night here in the big part of the park.  Healy went deep again in the fourth inning, launching a two-run shot into the left-center-field seats with one out and Davis aboard via a leadoff walk to make it 5-1. Toronto cut the deficit to 5-2 in the fifth as Ezequiel Carrera led off with a walk and scored on Pillar's double to left. NOTES: A's LF Khris Davis left the game in the top of the eighth with tightness in a calf that developed over the game.  We'll see how he is tomorrow,  manager Bob Melvin said. ... Blue Jays LHP J.P. Howell (left shoulder tightness) was placed on the 10-day disabled list, and LHP Jeff Beliveau was recalled from Triple-A Buffalo. Beliveau pitched a scoreless eighth inning. ... Blue Jays C Russell Martin (strained neck) returned to the starting lineup after missing three games. He went 0-for-4. ... Blue Jays 2B Devon Travis was out of the lineup after being hit on his left hand by a pitch Sunday against the Yankees. ... A's OF Mark Canha, who missed Sunday's game against Washington with stomach flu, started in right field Monday and finished 0-for-3. ...

A Reuters poll showed 56 of 60 analysts expected the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy committee to keep its repo rate INREPO=ECI unchanged at a 6-1/2 year low of 6.25 percent for a fourth meeting in a row. They also expected the reverse repo rate INRREP=ECI to be left at 6.00 percent. What analysts and investors are looking for this time is a less hawkish policy statement to reflect reduced fears of inflationary pressures. Until a few weeks ago, bond market investors were on guard for a possible future increases in interest rates after the RBI warned of  upside risks  to inflation at its last policy meeting in April.   We don't expect any change in the official neutral stance in June but we do expect RBI to tone down its hawkishness compared to the April and February policy statements,  said Siddhartha Sanyal, chief India economist at Barclays.  Investors have begun pricing in a softer tone from the RBI, with benchmark 10-year bond yields IN10YT=RR down about 35  basis points since hitting an over 7-month high on May 2. Some bolder investors are even betting on possible future rate cuts. Consumer price inflation data for May will be released next week, but going by the April figures inflation is trending well below the RBI's projection for 4.5 percent in the six months to September, and 5.0 percent for the six months through to March next year. Notching its lowest annual rate in at least five years, consumer price inflation INCPIY=ECI  slowed to 2.99 percent in April from 3.89 percent in March, just below the RBI's target of 4.0 percent. Meantime, the economy suffered a sharper setback than many economists had expected from the government's shock move last November to take high denomination currency bills out of circulation in a bid to curb tax avoidance. Gross domestic product grew 6.1 percent in January-March, down from 7 percent the previous quarter, to post it slowest growth rate in more than two years. Investors' uncertainty over the RBI's stance was heightened by the release of minutes from the April meeting of the monetary policy committee which showed two of its six members had proposed rate hikes, before the committee ultimately voted 6-0 to leave rates unchanged. The RBI had justified its hawkish stance citing the impact of planned pay hikes for government employees and the introduction of a nationwide goods and service tax (GST), as well as fears of a weaker-than-expected monsoon. Monsoon rains, however, arrived ahead of schedule this month and are forecast to be above-average, and government has avoided jacking up GST rates except for certain items it considers luxuries, including movie tickets. An around 5 percent rally in the rupee INR=D2 against the dollar this year could further ease inflation, while global commodity prices have eased.  HSBC said it still saw the possibility of a rate cut in August, a move the RBI could set up by adjusting its inflation projections. The central bank had changed its monetary policy to  neutral  from  accommodative  in February, leaving it open to raise, or lower, rates in months ahead.  It's time the RBI adjusts its inflation forecasts to strengthen its credibility,  HSBC said in a recent note to clients.

By Thin Lei Win PEMONGKONG, Indonesia (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In early 2016, when fellow farmers were despairing over plummeting yields linked to a major drought, Hamdi was busy harvesting maize from his land.  He got 5.6 tonnes instead of the usual 4 tonnes from his one-hectare (2.5-acre) plot, despite living in West Nusa Tenggara, one of Indonesia's driest provinces where agriculture is at the mercy of extreme weather such as that brought by the El Nino climate pattern.   El Nino did not affect those practicing conservation agriculture, but those who weren't suffered a lot,  the 38-year-old told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on a sunny afternoon in Pemongkong village on Lombok island.  Hamdi, who goes by one name only, was among the first in his village to adopt the natural farming method in October 2015, just before El Nino hit.  He was initially attracted by talk of possible savings because conservation agriculture requires less fertilizer, as well as less labor for weeding and preparing land.  But the greatest benefit so far has been its ability to help Hamdi weather the long drought.  Lombok farmers who practiced conservation agriculture were more resilient to the effects of El Nino, harvesting about 70 percent more than those using traditional methods, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).   Conservation agriculture is about renewing the life of the soil,  said John Weatherson, an advisor to the FAO.  It's about stabilizing yield so when the shocks come, the farmers are sitting pretty.    The method has always been around, but rising pressures from a changing climate, growing population and shrinking arable land have prompted  a search for more sustainable, ecologically conscious practices , said Catherine Chan-Halbrendt, an expert on the issue at the University of Hawaii. In conservation agriculture, soil disturbance is kept to a minimum, using permanent planting holes fertilized with compost instead of chemicals.  The soil surface is covered with crop residues as mulch, and farmers rotate crops or inter-crop between cereals and legumes.  These practices help reduce erosion and water run-off, and increase soil fertility and crop yields, experts say.  Pemongkong villagers, who have tried the method for two planting seasons, say yields have risen. Alongside lower costs for fertilisers and labor, they have more money in their hands.  Better Diets  Conservation agriculture is being adopted in other places, including Siberia which has millions of hectares of degraded cropland and Canada, where crop rotation has added organic nitrogen to the soil and broken cycles of pests and diseases. In Indonesia, growing nutritious plants as cover crops has improved the diets of Pemongkong villagers, with many now eating long beans, soya beans and mung beans regularly.  Saimah, 50, a rake-thin farmer whose two-hectare plot was affected by El Nino, used to have just one meal a day, but her crop yield has nearly doubled with conservation agriculture.   Now we eat eggs regularly and meat once a month. I can finally have savings,  she said.  Despite its benefits, the concept was alien to many farmers when the FAO introduced it in West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara, two eastern provinces with high food insecurity, low rainfall and weak agricultural productivity, said Ageng Herianto, the agency's assistant representative in Indonesia.   The biggest challenge we faced was changing their mindsets,  Herianto said. Conventional farming requires heavy soil preparation and burning of unwanted biomass, which releases the carbon stored in it, contributing to climate change - none of which happens with conservation agriculture.  The FAO partnered with the Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Research and Development, and used demonstration plots to show farmers the new approach.  It has now been taken up by nearly 13,000 farmers, and the FAO is working with the Indonesian government to incorporate it into national agricultural policy, the U.N. agency said. Challenges  Yet challenges remain, especially because many farmers are so used to conventional practices.  The FAO provided Pemongkong villagers with high-quality composite maize seeds produced through open pollination, which can be reused several times and perform better during extreme weather conditions, said Herianto.  Yet Hamdi, who enjoyed two successful planting seasons, has no seeds left. He sold them all, partly because the price of maize was so good, and partly because he was worried yields would fall if he continued to use composite seeds.  For the coming season, he plans to revert to hybrid seeds, which cost between 50,000 and 65,000 rupiah ($3.76-$4.89) per kilo. Farmers say about 30 kg are needed per hectare.   With hybrids, I know I will have to buy them every year and I will spend more money,  he said.  But hybrids are easier to find in the market and more resistant to pests.   This highlights how much needs to be done for farmers to grasp the pros and cons of different seed varieties, said FAO advisor Weatherson, who practices conservation agriculture in Swaziland where he lives.  Hybrid seeds have very high yield potential but require irrigation, or at least predictable rainfall and good fertilization, he said.   I think what the farmers need more than anything else is... to be given all the technical advice they need to be able to make informed decisions,  he said.

By Thin Lei Win PEMONGKONG, Indonesia (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In early 2016, when fellow farmers were despairing over plummeting yields linked to a major drought, Hamdi was busy harvesting maize from his land.  He got 5.6 tonnes instead of the usual 4 tonnes from his one-hectare (2.5-acre) plot, despite living in West Nusa Tenggara, one of Indonesia's driest provinces where agriculture is at the mercy of extreme weather such as that brought by the El Nino climate pattern.   El Nino did not affect those practicing conservation agriculture, but those who weren't suffered a lot,  the 38-year-old told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on a sunny afternoon in Pemongkong village on Lombok island.  Hamdi, who goes by one name only, was among the first in his village to adopt the natural farming method in October 2015, just before El Nino hit.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept rates at a record low 1.50 percent in a widely expected move after last easing in August of 2016. It cited a stabilization in mining investment after years of steep falls, a rebound in the price of Australia's top exports of iron ore and coal, and the country's biggest-ever home building boom.  Looking forward, economic growth is still expected to increase gradually over the next couple of years to a little above 3 percent,  the RBA said in a statement.  That expression of confidence was enough to lift the Australian dollar AUD=D4 closer to a 10-day high of $0.7500 touched on Monday. Policy makers also played down the importance of first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) figures due on Wednesday, which are likely to show the economy had barely grown.  It's a pretty neutral statement from the RBA,  said Tapas Strickland, economist at National Australia Bank.   They are going to overlook the slowdown in GDP as a temporary blip. We think they will remain on hold until they see any signs of a pick up in the labor market.  The futures market <0#YIB:> implies only a one-in-five chance of a cut in cash rates by year end.  The RBA described the job market as  mixed  with stronger employment growth offset by softness in hours worked and high levels of underemployment. Analysts forecast the economy expanded a meager 0.2 percent in the March quarter, a step back from the previous quarter's brisk 1.1 percent. ECONAU FILE PHOTO: A pedestrian is reflected in a wall of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) head office in central Sydney, Australia, October 3, 2016.David Gray/File PhotoGrowth for the year is seen slowing to around 1.6 percent, from 2.4 percent, the slowest since 2009. Deficit Shrinks A big unknown is household consumption which surprised with its strength late in 2016, but is being burdened by record-low wage growth and high levels of mortgage debt. Data out on Tuesday showed government spending had added only marginally to growth in the quarter, restrained in part by persistent budget deficits. Also weighing on real growth was a drop in export volumes, while imports swung higher. As a result, net exports trimmed a larger-then-expected 0.7 percentage points from growth, leading some analysts to revise down their forecasts for GDP. ECONAU The country's current account deficit did narrow to its smallest in more than 15 years at A$3.1 billion ($2.31 billion), though that disappointed hopes for a rare surplus. The main miss came from investment income with Australians earning less from their assets abroad. Yet the figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics  showed a barnstorming performance by commodity exports which boosted the surplus on goods and services to A$9.0 billion. That was easily the biggest surplus since the series began in 1959 and owed much to higher prices for iron ore and coal, though those have come off their peaks in the last month or so. The sharp improvement in the country's perennial deficit with the rest of the world should make it less vulnerable to swings in investor sentiment. It also lessens one threat to Australia's top credit rating, which has been under pressure from persistent budget shortfalls at home. Standard & Poors recently affirmed the rating at triple-A after spending months warning that a downgrade might be warranted.

The Reserve Bank of India is likely to keep interest rates unchanged at 6.25 percent at its review on Wednesday, but likely to sound less hawkish than the last monetary policy committee meeting, according to a Reuters poll.

Broader market is correcting as well,  said Neeraj Dewan, director, Quantum Securities.  There isn't any reason to be bullish right now.

ITC Ltd's shares fell as much as 2.6 percent in their biggest intraday percentage drop in over a month and were among the top percentage losers on the NSE index. India Grid Trust fell as much as 6.3 percent in its debut due to a lack of investor familiarity with infrastructure investment fund.

Iron ore prices in China have plunged in recent weeks, reversing more than half of a 130 percent rally from the end of 2015 to a peak in March this year.  SGX iron ore, which mirrors the spot price, ended at $55.35 a ton on Monday, down 38 percent from a high of $90.16 on March 16, but still well above $39.58 at end-2015.  The decline in the main Chinese domestic benchmark futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange hasn't been quite as dramatic, with the contract closing at 435.5 yuan ($64) a ton on Monday, down 32 percent from a peak of 636.5 yuan on Feb. 21.  But this price volatility hasn't been reflected in imports by China, which buys two-thirds of global seaborne iron ore.  China's seaborne imports were 85.8 million tonnes in May, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts.  Preliminary official data is likely to be released in the next few days, and while the ship data doesn't exactly align with customs figures, it has been an accurate pointer and is generally slightly more conservative than the customs data.  If the official numbers are in line with the vessel-tracking forecast, it would represent a modest increase on April's customs imports of 82.23 million tonnes of iron ore.  Using the vessel-tracking data shows a remarkable consistency of the imports so far this year, especially when calculated on a daily basis.  January's daily imports were 2.72 million tonnes, February's 2.71 million, March's 2.79 million, April's 2.74 million and May's 2.77 million. (For a graphic on China's iron ore imports, click tmsnrt.rs/2qRM7X6) Fundamentals Re-Asserting?  What the data shows is that the volatility in prices wasn't related to the fundamentals of supply and demand, rather it was largely due to sentiment and investor speculation.  Prices were driven higher as investors took the view that the Chinese government was working to boost spending on infrastructure and construction, main consumers of the steel that iron ore is used to produce.  While there was some justification for this view, it's also the case that the market rallied too hard and too quickly, and then tried to ignore the warning signs for too long.  Among the signals that the rally was overblown was the surge in China's iron ore port inventories to record highs and signs of some tightening of monetary conditions in China, a process that normally crimps commodity demand growth.  The question now is whether the iron ore market in China is close to reverting to trading on supply and demand fundamentals, or whether there is still froth to come out of prices.  The consensus of analysts certainly appears to be that the market is close to trading on fundamentals, with a Reuters survey showing the median expectation is for prices to stay close to current levels over the rest of 2017.  The median forecast for the spot price of 62 percent iron ore on a cost and freight basis into China was $62 a ton for the third quarter and $58 a ton for the fourth.  These forecasts are slightly higher than the current spot price, but generally fit well with a  steady-as-she-goes  scenario for Chinese iron ore imports.  The price forecast seems to recognize that China's demand for imported iron ore is growing at a modest and consistent pace.

The People’s Republic has more to lose than the United States from the soon-to-be nuclear power on its doorstep. Regime change led by China, rather than the United States, may be the best of a range of unappealing options. China has the experience and resources to rebuild the Hermit Kingdom. But the government seems paralysed by the escalating situation next door. It has stuck to its diplomatic philosophy of not meddling in the internal affairs of other countries - a position that is increasingly inflexible for a would-be world power. Officials are also hobbled by their own propaganda. Most citizens were taught that the hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers who died in the Korean War were defending their country from U.S. aggressors. This makes any overt cooperation with America a tough sell domestically. Graphic: Risky business: reut.rs/2rYuXv4 There are also valid economic concerns. Tougher sanctions that destabilised North Korea's economy would send refugees flooding across the border into the rust belt of northeast China, where they would aggravate already serious economic stress. Even so, the relationship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is fraying. The North Korean regime has snatched Chinese fishing boats and tested atomic bombs during important Chinese holidays. It launched ballistic missile trials during the recent  Belt and Road  infrastructure forum in Beijing, stealing headlines from a summit intended to showcase China's global leadership. The country's young leader Kim Jong-un has also moved against senior government officials who were considered pro-China, including his uncle Jang Song-thaek. His half-brother Kim Jong-nam was assassinated in Malaysia despite residing in Macau under China's ostensible protection. Propping up the rogue state also has opportunity costs. Support for the Kim regime - which depends on Chinese oil donations just to keep its lights on – not only justifies the continued presence of U.S. troops south of the demilitarised zone, but undermines South Korean politicians who favour closer relations with China. This frustrates both Chinese diplomats and its younger citizens, who are mad for South Korean pop and fashion. Graphic: Little brother: reut.rs/2qZJem0 Chinese customs data shows bilateral trade with South Korea surpassed $85 billion in the first four months of 2017, making the Asian democracy China's third-largest trading partner and its number one source of imports. Trade with North Korea, on the other hand, was a paltry $1.6 billion over the same period. Reform and Opening 2.0 Say the People's Republic managed to remove or sideline the obnoxious Kim. China could then help to rebuild the North Korean economy using the reform template it developed after the death of Chairman Mao Zedong in 1976. China left the dictator’s image intact, but ripped up his economic policies, unleashing decades of growth. Seoul would protest in public, but might exhale in private; so would America. A more docile North Korea could wind down its nuclear programme, formally end the Korean War, and perhaps even establish a timetable for reunification. If Beijing managed to reproduce China's post-Mao growth rates – which have averaged around 10 percent since 1978 – North Korea's $40 billion economy would balloon to $1.5 trillion in four decades. Allowing wider private ownership could unleash a real estate and infrastructure boom. The spillover from trade between China and South Korea passing through the North would be massive. An actual intervention would be highly risky. Deposing a leader known for executing his own people with anti-aircraft guns is tough. War would be devastating. But it needn't come to that. Just by signalling it's considering harder options, Beijing would open a second front. That, more than anything else, might frighten Kim back to the negotiating table. Not So Fast The alternative is for China to keep making threatening but empty economic gestures while trying to squeeze concessions out of the United States. For all the bluster about China banning coal imports, customs data shows the country's net trade with North Korea has risen in the first months of this year - hardly an effective embargo. In the absence of far tougher sanctions or the threat of military attack, however, Pyongyang has no good reason to abandon its nuclear programme. Kim's legitimacy rests on his ability to defend his people against real or imagined foreign threats. Once armed with a nuclear deterrent North Korea will be even less pliable. At that point China will be out of options, even ugly ones.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

One of the neighbours, Ikenna Chigbo, said he recognised Butt from a photo issued by British police following Saturday night's attack in the capital which killed seven and injured nearly 50. Chigbo told Reuters that the man he knew as  Abz  had shown interest in a van he had rented.  I was in the process of moving house, he was looking at the van, asking me where I hired it, how much it cost, and if the vans were available in automatic,  said Chigbo, who lived in a neighbouring apartment in Barking, east London.  That was Saturday, approximately 3 pm. He came across ... almost euphoric. He just seemed on a whole different level. It was quite strange.  Reuters could not independently verify the identity of the man who spoke to Chigbo. About seven hours later, shortly before 10 pm (2100 GMT), Butt - along with Rachid Redouane and another man not yet named by police - began their rampage across London Bridge and through the bustling Borough Market area. All three were shot dead at the scene by police. Pakistani-born Butt, 27, a keen fan of Arsenal soccer club, was known to the intelligence services but not thought to be actively plotting an attack. His conversation with Chigbo also reinforces suggestions that Britain's third deadly militant incident in just three months may have involved little planning or sophistication. Police have said they need a major re-think about how to counter such plots by people who had come onto their radar but were not considered a serious threat.  We are all needing to look very hard at our strategy at what we've been doing,  said Cressida Dick, London's police chief.  In my view we will need to change again in the future.  Saturday's attack follows a similar method first seen in Britain four years ago when two British Muslim converts used a car to mow down soldier Lee Rigby before stabbing him to death. The London Bridge rampage was almost a direct copy of the crude attack in March when Khalid Masood ploughed into pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge before stabbing a policeman to death in the grounds of parliament. Neither attack seemed to be the result of any long-term planning nor, despite the claim of responsibility by Islamic State, any serious foreign direction.  We are dealing with people who appear very volatile, very unstable many of them, people who are prepared to use low-tech methods, (who) sometimes go from thinking about the idea to carrying out the attack in a very short space of time,  Dick said, adding further copycat attacks were a possibility.  Terrorism Breeds Terrorism  Prime Minister Theresa May has said Britain is faced with a new trend where  terrorism breeds terrorism  and inspired not just by  carefully-constructed plots after years of planning and training – and not even as lone attackers radicalised online – but by copying one another and often using the crudest of means of attack . Britain's domestic intelligence agency MI5 has identified about 23,000 people as potentially violent Islamists with 3,000 of these considered to pose a threat. It is currently running 500 active investigations.  It is a very large number. It's very, very hard. You only have to think how would you go about keeping under very active surveillance over 20,000 people,  Dick said. Most of those involved in the three recent attacks were known to the security services, but none had been considered to pose a threat that required extra surveillance. The Westminster Bridge attacker had shown up on the periphery of previous terrorism investigations that brought Masood to MI5's notice, but not enough to warrant further action. Investigators now believe he was a  lone wolf , who radicalised himself through material on the internet. Salman Abedi - the 22-year-old born in Britain to Libyan parents who killed 22 people in a suicide attack on a pop concert in Manchester last month - was also known to MI5 but not under active investigation. The BBC reported concerns had been raised with the authorities on at least three occasions. Butt was known to police and MI5. He appeared in a TV documentary last year about a radical group which was seen at one stage unfurling an Islamic State flag. One of his friends told BBC Asian Network he had phoned an anti-terrorist hotline set up by British authorities because he feared Butt had been radicalised after watching clips of U.S. preacher Ahmad Musa Jebril, whose online sermons have been a leading source of inspiration for foreign fighters in Syria.  I did my bit, I know a lot of people did but the authorities didn't do their bit and that's what's shocking,  the friend, who the BBC did not identify, said. Another neighbour also said she had reported Butt to police two years ago after she feared he was radicalising children in a local park.  There was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned and the investigation had been prioritised accordingly,  police said in a statement. A report by Britain's Intelligence and Security Committee into Rigby's murder in May 2013 concluded the security services could not have stopped the attack. However, one of the killers had been investigated five times, twice as a high priority, and it said more needed to be done in dealing with low-level suspects. With finite resources, the authorities have to weigh up who poses the greatest threat and needs intensive monitoring. At least two dozen people are needed to carry out 24-hour surveillance on just one suspect and about 50 officers can be required at times.  It's costly and difficult and it's hard to know what's going on in people's minds,  Commissioner Dick said. The authorities say they have foiled 18 plots since Rigby's killing, including five since the Westminster Bridge attack in March. Raffaello Pantucci, Director of International Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, said it was not clear whether intelligence agencies would be able to develop a system which could cope with such low-tech plots.  You can do all the sort of calculations you want ... but ultimately it's going to be difficult if all it takes to do a plot is to get a knife and drive your car into people,  he said.  In a way it would be even worse if they didn't know who these people were, and were looking in completely the wrong place.

Iron ore prices in China have plunged in recent weeks, reversing more than half of a 130 percent rally from the end of 2015 to a peak in March this year.  SGX iron ore, which mirrors the spot price, ended at $55.35 a ton on Monday, down 38 percent from a high of $90.16 on March 16, but still well above $39.58 at end-2015.  The decline in the main Chinese domestic benchmark futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange hasn't been quite as dramatic, with the contract closing at 435.5 yuan ($64) a ton on Monday, down 32 percent from a peak of 636.5 yuan on Feb. 21.  But this price volatility hasn't been reflected in imports by China, which buys two-thirds of global seaborne iron ore.  China's seaborne imports were 85.8 million tonnes in May, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts.  Preliminary official data is likely to be released in the next few days, and while the ship data doesn't exactly align with customs figures, it has been an accurate pointer and is generally slightly more conservative than the customs data.  If the official numbers are in line with the vessel-tracking forecast, it would represent a modest increase on April's customs imports of 82.23 million tonnes of iron ore.  Using the vessel-tracking data shows a remarkable consistency of the imports so far this year, especially when calculated on a daily basis.  January's daily imports were 2.72 million tonnes, February's 2.71 million, March's 2.79 million, April's 2.74 million and May's 2.77 million. (For a graphic on China's iron ore imports, click tmsnrt.rs/2qRM7X6) Fundamentals Re-Asserting?  What the data shows is that the volatility in prices wasn't related to the fundamentals of supply and demand, rather it was largely due to sentiment and investor speculation.  Prices were driven higher as investors took the view that the Chinese government was working to boost spending on infrastructure and construction, main consumers of the steel that iron ore is used to produce.  While there was some justification for this view, it's also the case that the market rallied too hard and too quickly, and then tried to ignore the warning signs for too long.  Among the signals that the rally was overblown was the surge in China's iron ore port inventories to record highs and signs of some tightening of monetary conditions in China, a process that normally crimps commodity demand growth.  The question now is whether the iron ore market in China is close to reverting to trading on supply and demand fundamentals, or whether there is still froth to come out of prices.  The consensus of analysts certainly appears to be that the market is close to trading on fundamentals, with a Reuters survey showing the median expectation is for prices to stay close to current levels over the rest of 2017.  The median forecast for the spot price of 62 percent iron ore on a cost and freight basis into China was $62 a ton for the third quarter and $58 a ton for the fourth.  These forecasts are slightly higher than the current spot price, but generally fit well with a  steady-as-she-goes  scenario for Chinese iron ore imports.  The price forecast seems to recognize that China's demand for imported iron ore is growing at a modest and consistent pace.

India Grid Trust shares were down 1.55 percent at 98.45 rupees by 0605 GMT on the National Stock Exchange, having dropped to a low of 93.70 rupees compared with their issue price of 100 rupees. The company is only the second infrastructure investment fund to list in India after IRB InvIT Fund debuted in May with another lacklustre opening. Its shares are trading below the issue price after the fund raised $782 million in its IPO. Traders and investment bankers attributed the weak performance to a lack of clarity in India about this new product, an entity that invests in rent-yielding assets and distributes most of their income to shareholders as dividends.  There seems to be a perception issue with these instruments,  said Arun Kejriwal, founder of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services.  There was marketing fervour when the issues came, but now reality concerns are stepping in. Until the first round of interest and dividend is paid out and people understand how these instruments operate, any further issue is most unlikely.  At least $1.3 billion in listings from other infrastructure investment funds were expected in India this year, including from Reliance Infrastructure InvIT, MEP Infrastructure Developers and IL&FS; Transportation InvIT. The India Grid IPO was subscribed only 1.35 times versus 8.6 times for IRB InvIT Fund, and well below the responses seen at other IPOs earlier in the year. The lack of investor interest in infrastructure investment funds comes as India heads to a bumper year in IPOs, including up to $1 billion listings by National Stock Exchange as well as SBI Life Insurance Co Ltd.  This is a yield-generating asset so we should not evaluate these instruments right away at the listing. We can evaluate these instruments once they give their first pay out to the unit holder,  said Abhishek Lodhiya, senior equity research analyst at Angel Broking.

The dollar was down 0.7 percent at 109.700 yen after brushing 109.660, its lowest since April 25. Initially buoyed by an overnight bounce in U.S. yields, it had briefly risen to 110.510 early in the session. The greenback has been firmly on the defensive since Friday's weaker-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report prompted investors to pare back expectations of future interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.  It's difficult to pinpoint a single factor but the UK elections and Comey's testimony will take place on the same day, which is making the market nervous,  said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager of State Street Bank, referring to both events set for Thursday.  The dollar is already on the defensive after Friday's jobs data, and now it's facing potential geopolitical risk in the form of Comey's testimony.  Comey, the FBI director fired by U.S. President Donald Trump in May, will be grilled by the Senate Intelligence Committee on whether Trump tried to get him to back off an investigation into alleged ties between the president's 2016 campaign and Russia. In Britain, the latest opinion poll by Survation for ITV television showed Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labour Party holding at just 1 percentage point ahead of Thursday's election. Sterling was 0.2 percent higher at $1.2927 following its rise overnight to a 10-day peak of $1.2940. The euro pared overnight losses and rose 0.2 percent to $1.1275, edging back towards a seven-month high of $1.1285 reached on Friday. The common currency's advance was relatively slow as a wait-and-see mood prevailed ahead of Thursday's European Central Bank policy meeting, which is likely to result in another baby step towards removing the extraordinary monetary stimulus. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies went as low as 96.560, its weakest since Nov. 9. The Australian dollar bounced from an earlier dip to last trade at $0.7490, little changed on the day, after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept interest rates at a record low of 1.5 percent, as expected, while their economic assessment was not as bearish as some had braced for. The Aussie had earlier fallen to $0.7457 after Australia posted current account data for January-March. The deficit was the smallest in more than 15 years, but it still disappointed investors who had hoped for a rare surplus.

Monday's panic selling may ease if investors start speculating about the possibility of some kind of negotiated solution, while some traders think Qatari state-linked funds could eventually enter the market to provide support.  While we think the near-term impact of the crisis is easily containable by Qatar, which has substantial resources it can employ, we see considerable risks regarding the economic and financial impact of these sanctions the longer they remain in place,  said a note by Citigroup. A key question for the market is whether Qatar's financial ties to Saudi Arabia and the UAE are cut off, in addition to its transport ties. Saudi and UAE bankers said late on Monday they had so far received no instructions from their regulators to do this. But some Sri Lankan banks stopped buying Qatari riyals on Tuesday, saying their counterpart banks in Singapore had advised them not to accept the currency. On Monday some Egyptian banks said they too had stopped dealings with Doha-headquartered lenders, though Egypt's central bank urged banks to continue dealing in Qatari riyals. A Saudi-based money market manager told Reuters that although he had not received a directive from the Saudi central bank to stop dealings with Qatar, he was  taking precautionary steps to keep away  until the situation started to show signs of de-escalating. A note by Capital Economics said one potential concern was that Qatari banks, the dominant sector on Qatar's stock market, might now find it more difficult to secure wholesale financing, which could  precipitate a more abrupt cooling of the country’s credit boom . Gulf markets in general look set to have a soft tone after global bourses dropped, partly because of the Gulf tensions. Brent oil fell 1 percent on Monday and has since retreated a further 0.4 percent to $49.26 a barrel. Any losses in Saudi Arabia, however, may be limited by expectations that MSCI will start on June 20 the process of upgrading Riyadh to emerging market status. Hopes for this have buoyed the Saudi market in recent days. (Reporting by Celine Aswad; Editing by Andrew Torchia)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-stocks-idUSL8N1J30E8"},

European stocks were headed for a subdued start, with financial spreadbetter CMC Markets expecting Britain's FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 to open flat. Germany's DAX is predicted to start the day down 0.1 percent. Oil fell back following a brief recovery after Saudi Arabia and several other Arab states severed ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting extremism and undermining regional stability.  A potential risk to monitor might be that Qatar will view this as being provided with less encouragement to comply with the agreed (OPEC) production quota,  said Jameel Ahmad of futures brokerage FXTM. Stocks in Qatar plunged more than 8 percent overnight to their lowest since January 2016. U.S. crude was 0.5 percent lower at $47.18 a barrel on Tuesday, after falling 0.55 percent on Monday. Global benchmark Brent retreated 0.4 percent to $49.26, extending Monday's 1 percent slide. The dollar index touched a seven-month low ahead of testimony before the U.S. Congress from former FBI director James Comey on Thursday. There will be intense interest in what Comey might say about his conversations with U.S. President Donald Trump about an investigation into former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials.  The dollar is already on the defensive after Friday's jobs data, and now it's facing potential geopolitical risk in the form of Comey's testimony,  said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager of State Street Bank. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of trade-weighted peers, fell to its lowest level since the November U.S. election. At 0524 GMT, it was down 0.2 percent, to 96.611. The dollar slid 0.5 percent to 109.90 yen on Tuesday, close to the six-week low hit earlier in the session. News on Monday of U.S. services sector activity slowing in May as new orders tumbled also hit the dollar. The dollar further came under pressure from a stronger euro, on expectations the European Central Bank will take a less dovish tone than in the past at its Thursday meeting. The ECB may even discuss dropping some of its pledges to ramp up stimulus if needed, four people with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters last week. The common currency was 0.1 percent higher at $1.127 on Tuesday. Sterling advanced 0.2 percent to $1.293 on Tuesday. The lead of British Prime Minister Theresa May over the opposition Labour Party ahead of Thursday's general election has narrowed to just 1 percentage point, according to a poll conducted before the attacks in London on Saturday. Other polls in recent days have found bigger leads for the Conservatives of up to 11 and 12 points.  Even if May does just about enough to increase the majority - that could still potentially be sterling positive,  said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel. The weaker dollar lifted gold, with spot gold hitting a six-week high earlier on Tuesday and last trading up 0.4 percent at $1,284.74 an ounce. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.15 percent, pulling back from a two-year high hit on Monday. Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.6 percent, tripped by a stronger yen. South Korean markets were closed for a holiday. Australian shares tumbled 1.4 percent. The Australian dollar pared earlier losses - made after the second-quarter current account deficit disappointed investors hoping for a surplus - to trade flat at $0.7489 after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept its benchmark rate at a record low 1.5 percent, as expected. Chinese shares and Hong Kong shares bucked the trend, rising almost 0.1 percent and 0.35 percent respectively. Overnight, Wall Street indexes slipped between 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent, with Apple Inc. leading losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Rookie Frederick Gaudreau and Swedes Calle Jarnkrok, Viktor Arvidsson and Filip Forsberg scored for Nashville while Finnish goalie Pekke Rinne made 23 saves for the hosts as they won a second consecutive game in the best-of-seven series.  We're at a point in the season where you sink or swim. Guys have to step up,  Predators coach Peter Laviolette told reporters.   Those are your only two choices. We need to have guys to continue to play the game at a high level because of where we're at in the season right now. Related CoverageNashville's Gaudreau needs no space to find room on biggest stageGaudreau scored what proved to be the game winner early in the second period but his wraparound goal was only awarded after a random horn sounded 35 seconds later to stop play and initiate a video review. The goal, which came seconds after Rinne stoned Chris Kunitz on a breakaway, initially appeared to be stopped by a stellar save from Penguins goalie Matt Murray but replays showed the puck crossed the goal line by about an inch. Jun 5, 2017; Nashville, TN, USA; Pittsburgh Penguins right wing Patric Hornqvist (72) collides with goalie Matt Murray (30) during play against the Nashville Predators in the third period in game four of the 2017 Stanley Cup Final at Bridgestone Arena. Mandatory Credit: Bruce Bennett/Pool Photo via USA TODAY SportsArvidsson gave the Predators some breathing room with seven minutes left in the period when he streaked in on a breakaway and beat Murray on his glove side with a laser-like wrist shot. From there, Rinne, who has picked up his play after allowing a combined eight goals in the first two games of the series, stymied the Penguins attack, while Forsberg sealed the win with an empty-net goal in the game's closing minutes. Slideshow (10 Images) Obviously it's hard to win when you score one goal,  Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said.   Having said that, I thought tonight, of all the games we played, we generated the most chances and the highest quality. It didn't go in the net for us. We had a number of Grade A opportunities, a couple of breakaways, flurries around the net.  Nashville had opened the scoring with about five minutes left in the first period when Jarnkrok flipped a rebound over the leg of a sprawling Murray shortly after a failed clearing attempt.

The Chinese contract drug research and development company priced the 193 million shares on offer at HK$20.60 each, sources with direct knowledge of the deal said, the top of its marketing range of HK$18.60 to HK$20.60 per share. The price would value the deal at HK$3.98 billion ($511 million). The deal will provide a much needed boost to IPO activity in Hong Kong, which has fallen by almost 50 percent from the same period in 2016 to $2.76 billion, the slowest start of a year since 2012. The IPO was more than 30 times subscribed, underscoring investors' appetite for a sector with a  rarity appeal , and for a company whose revenue jumped 77 percent in 2016 from the previous year. Profit more than tripled last year as it expanded the business and launched new projects.  The reason this deal is so popular is because we don't have other similar biotech companies listed in Hong Kong and WuXi Biologics itself has been performing quite well in recent years, which in turn has made investors more comfortable,  one of the sources said. The sources declined to be named because details of the initial public offering were not yet public. WuXi Biologics did not reply to a Reuters request for comment. The shares will debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange on June 13. WuXi Biologics, which does work for pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, plans to use about 45 percent of the IPO proceeds to pay all its outstanding loans and debt and another 45 percent to expand its facilities in Shanghai and in nearby Wuxi in Eastern China, the company said in the prospectus. The remaining 10 percent would be used for working capital. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, China Merchants Securities and Morgan Stanley acted as joint sponsors and joint bookrunners of the IPO, according to the prospectus. The banks stand to jointly earn about $17.9 million in fees, equivalent to a 2.5 percent underwriting commission and a 1 percent incentive fee, according to the prospectus. WuXi Biologics parent, WuXi Pharmatech, was among several Chinese companies that delisted from U.S. exchanges in 2015 seeking better valuations closer to their home market. The company's $3.6 billion take-private deal was among the biggest at the time.

Gaudreau netted the game-winner on Monday to level the best-of-seven series with the Pittsburgh Penguins at 2-2 and in the process became only the second NHL player in history to score his first three career goals in a Stanley Cup Final. An undrafted free agent playing in only his sixth playoff game, Gaudreau was a recent call up to the Predators lineup due to injuries and with the locker room already at capacity, only has a chair and small cabinet to his name.  I could be sitting on the floor and I would take it,  Gaudreau, 24, told reporters.  I'm just happy to be here. I don't really care about the stall, to be honest.  Gaudreau went scoreless in nine regular season games with Nashville and spent most of the campaign at Milwaukee in the American Hockey League. He earned a call up to the playoffs after Predators forward Ryan Johansen was injured during the NHL's Western Conference Final and has not missed a step since. His latest goal came on a solid individual effort when he stuffed home a wraparound attempt but the goal was only awarded after a random horn sounded 35 seconds later to stop play and initiate a video review. With the goal, the Canadian joined Johnny Harms of the 1944 Chicago Blackhawks as the only players to score their first three NHL goals in the league's title series.  Clearly the stage is not too big for him,  Predators forward Mike Fisher said.   It's been unbelievable for us, the way he's come, he's been so good. Timely goals, composed. You know, he definitely belongs. He's been a huge part of our success.  Gaudreau never made much of an impact in the junior ranks but has made a quick impression on the game's biggest stage and Predators coach Peter Laviolette said the player deserves all the credit.  When you start the way he did, having to work for everything, literally every contract and every opportunity, improve yourself. At this level, it's no different. That's on him,  Laviolette said.  That speaks to Freddy, to be honest with you. To be able to take the road that he has, come out on the end, be a contributing player in the Stanley Cup Finals.

The Astros right-hander pitched into the sixth inning and was supported by two home runs as Houston topped the Royals 7-3 Monday night for its 11th consecutive victory. The winning streak is the longest in the majors this year. Fiers has not lost on the road since Aug. 20, 2016, a span of 10 away starts. The Astros have won a franchise-record 11 straight road games.  We've had our troubles in past years winning on the road,  Fiers said.  I think it doesn't really matter where we're at. So, no matter where we're at and who we're facing, we just have that confidence to go out there and win ballgames.  Yuli Gurriel homered for the second straight game, a three-run blast in the ninth to assure this one would end in the win column. Gurriel hit an 0-1 Kelvin Herrera pitch with Alex Bregman and Brian McCann aboard. McCann belted a two-run homer in the fourth inning. Fiers (3-2) earned a victory for the first time in five career starts against the Royals. He yielded two runs on seven hits and a walk while striking out four in five-plus innings. He won back-to-back starts for the first time this season. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at RoyalsHouston Astros - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatch Just be aggressive, get ahead, strike one's big,  Fiers said.  Just keep them in counts that are favorable to me. Just keep them out of the 2-0, 3-1 as much as possible. Execute quality pitches.  The Astros jumped out to a 4-0 lead off Ian Kennedy (0-6), who is winless in 14 starts, including all 10 this season. Houston took a 2-0 advantage in the second. McCann doubled with one out, and Gurriel walked. Nori Aoki singled to right, scoring McCann, but was thrown out trying to stretch it into a double. George Springer's two-out single scored Gurriel. McCann homered with Marwin Gonzalez aboard in the fourth to make it 4-0. After Gonzalez walked leading off the inning, McCann drove Kennedy's first pitch out to right-center.  A fastball down the middle,  Kennedy said of the pitch to McCann.  Give them a lot of credit because they're real hot, the pitching staff and their hitters are real hot. There is no real break in their lineup right now.  The Royals cut the lead in half in the bottom of the fourth. Eric Hosmer doubled and Mike Moustakas walked. Brandon Moss' opposite-field two-out double scored Hosmer and advanced Moustakas to third. Alcides Escobar's bunt single to third baseman Gonzalez scored Moustakas. Kennedy was removed after five innings, having allowed four runs on six hits and three walks. He threw 96 pitches. His ERA went up to 5.33 in 10 starts this season.  He was just fighting his command,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  After two innings, he had more balls than strikes. That's not recommended, especially against this team, to pitch behind in the count because they can do a lot of damage.  The Royals threatened in the sixth with Hosmer and Salvador Perez singles and a Gonzalez throwing error putting runners on the corners with no outs. Houston manager A.J. Hinch summoned left-hander Reymin Guduan from the bullpen to replace Fiers. Guduan retired Moustakas on a liner to third base and struck out Moss. James Hoyt relieved Guduan and struck out Escobar to strand the runners.  Especially with nobody out, you're looking to at least tack on one there,  Yost said. Royals second baseman Whit Merrifield went 0-for-5 to end his 19-game hitting streak.  I took some bad swings at good pitches,  Merrifield said.  It's just one of those nights. I just didn't make very good swings at pitches that I had been making good swings on.  Gonzalez left in the seventh inning with a left hand injury.  His left hand started bothering him a couple of innings before I took him out,  Hinch said.  It's the heel of his hand, left hand discomfort. So, he's got to get some tests done and see the doctor. I didn't learn about it until his at-bat was starting to come up. He went down and tried to hit in the cage and didn't feel like he could hit, so I took him out.  The Astros (42-16) have the best record in the majors and are 26 games above .500 for the first time since October 2001. The Royals (24-32) dropped to eight games below .500 and are 15-15 at home. NOTES: Manager Ned Yost altered the Royals' batting order, putting 2B Whit Merrifield at the top and batting rookie RF Jorge Bonifacio second for the first time. ... Astros CF George Springer was selected the AL player of the week after hitting .500 with multiple hits in all six games. He had five home runs and nine RBIs. ... Royals SS Alcides Escobar, who has swiped 17 or more bases in six straight years, stole his first base in the fourth inning. ... Rookie RHPs David Paulino (0-0, 4.50 ERA) of the Astros and Jake Junis (1-0, 2.70 ERA) of the Royals are the Tuesday probables.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-astros-royals-writethru-idUSMTZED663XGKOK"},

Asian shares pulled back from a two-year high hit on Monday, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  falling 0.2 percent in early trade.      Oil prices extended losses from the previous session over concerns that a rift between Qatar and other Arab states could undermine an OPEC-led push to tighten the market.             Elections in the UK, a European Central Bank meeting and an impending testimony by former FBI Director James Comey have made investors cautious, said Grace Aller, an analyst with Manila-based AP Securities.      Comey was leading a probe into alleged Russian meddling in last year's U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by  Donald Trump's campaign when the president fired him last month.        In Southeast Asia, Philippine shares fell as much as 0.5 percent with heavyweights SM Investments Corp and SM Prime Holdings losing as much as 1.3 percent each.      We expect investors to cash in their gains now in anticipation of (a likely) Fed interest rate hike next week,  said Rachelle Cruz, an analyst with AP Securities.     Indonesian shares slipped as much as 0.4 percent, led by losses in financial stocks.     Bank Rakyat Indonesia fell as much as 1.2 percent, while Bank Central Asia dropped 1.3 percent.     An index of Indonesia's 45 most liquid stocks lost as much as 0.5 percent, its biggest fall in nearly two weeks.

(Reuters) - The first witness to testify in Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial said on Monday that the comedian had drugged her before sexually abusing her in 1998 - the same method prosecutors say he used in the alleged 2004 attack that he is on trial for. Cosby, once one of the most beloved entertainers in the United States, is accused in both instances of inviting a young woman to visit him for career advice, offering her pills that he said would help her  relax  and then sexually abusing her once she was incapacitated by the drug. The 79-year-old entertainer is charged with sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, an employee of his alma mater Temple University, at his home in the Philadelphia suburbs in 2004. Constand is one of dozens of women who have accused Cosby of sex assault but hers is the only case recent enough to be subject to criminal prosecution. The allegations, all of which Cosby has denied, have essentially ended his long career. The first witness at his trial, Kelly Johnson, described an incident that she said took place at Cosby's hotel suite in Los Angeles in 1996. Her emotional testimony was intended to persuade jurors that Cosby demonstrated a pattern of behavior when he allegedly attacked Constand in 2004. A tearful Johnson, who worked at the time for Cosby's agent, said she initially hid the pill under her tongue but that Cosby checked to see if she had swallowed it. She later woke up disoriented and partially clothed in Cosby's bed with the comedian behind her, grunting, before he forced her to touch his genitals, she testified.  I was trying to say something,  she said.  I don’t know if I was actually speaking.  Aggressive Cross-Examination Actor and comedian Bill Cosby (2nd L) leaves with lawyer Fortunato N. Perri, Jr. (L) and spokesman Andrew Wyatt after the first day of his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S. June 5, 2017.Brendan McDermidIn a potential preview of what Constand can expect when she testifies, Cosby's lawyer, Brian McMonagle, fired aggressive questions laced with sarcasm at Johnson. He claimed she offered much different details during a 1996 deposition, including that the assault occurred in 1990, six years earlier than she testified on Monday. He also suggested she used drugs in the 1990s, which she denied, and accused her of having  selective amnesia  after she could not recall details of her deposition or her medical leave from her employer following the Cosby incident. Cosby, once known as  America's dad  for his role as Heathcliff Huxtable on the 1980s hit TV series  The Cosby Show,  walked into court on the arm of Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played his youngest daughter, the pigtailed Rudy Huxtable.  Slideshow (9 Images)His wife and business manager, Camille Cosby, was not seen in court on Monday. Like Johnson, Constand will testify that Cosby told her the pills he offered would help her  relax  before assaulting her, Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden said in her opening statement on Monday. In his opening statement, McMonagle said Cosby is the victim of false accusations. He pointed out that Constand's initial allegations were investigated in 2005 and found to be insufficient at that time.  Today I get a chance, with your help, to right a wrong,  he told jurors. McMonagle told jurors that Constand's story suffered from numerous inconsistencies in her accounts to police in 2005.

That has meant the forceful emergence this year of  Europe ex-UK  as an investment class, as offshore investors actively seek to avoid lumping British stocks into any Europe-bound investments. The UK has been an intrinsic part of the European investment process for decades, in no small part because of London's role as the regional financial hub and because of deep links engendered by free trade and free movement of goods and people across the EU. With Brexit, and the future of many of those links uncertain, there is a growing realization that the UK and EU financial markets will develop their own nuances and drivers which require old assumptions to be challenged. Data from Lipper - a Thomson Reuters company - on year-to-date flows in and out of exchange traded funds (ETF), a proxy for broader investments, shows that this is well under way. ETFs that track European stocks excluding the UK are the ones seeing the strongest demand and the largest of these, the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU.Z), has seen a net $3.9 billion pumped into it this year. Meanwhile, regional ETFs which include UK stocks have bled money, suggesting investors looking only for European exposure are actively seeking to avoid British stocks.  Europe ex-UK  is not a new investment concept, and the size and scope of products available to investors is small compared to those available on a pan-European basis. According to Lipper, there are more than 1,800 mutual funds globally that invest in pan-European stocks and combined they manage more than $250 billion. The number of funds that invest in European stocks excluding those listed in the UK, meanwhile, total a little more than 150 and they manage a combined $50 billion. That said, the decoupling has been noticeable since Britain voted to leave the EU in 2016.  The two regions have been separate but that has been accentuated by Brexit,  said Stephen Mitchell, a portfolio manager who runs a global equities fund at Jupiter Asset Management.   American investors left the UK in the two weeks after Brexit - by July 2016 they were gone. The uncertainty of Brexit has kept them out,  Mitchell said, adding that they have returned to Europe but not the UK.  That's probably going to continue to be the case for the time being.  Consumer Worries After a year of second-guessing political outcomes and getting whipsawed by market moves in the aftermath of Brexit, the U.S. presidential election and the Italian constitutional referendum, investors have shied away from trading based on opinion polls and have sharpened focus on fundamentals. FILE PHOTO: An EU flag flies above Parliament Square during a Unite for Europe march, in London, Britain March 25, 2017.Peter Nicholls/File PhotoHere, the divergences between the UK and Europe are getting starker. Political risks facing the euro zone eased following the French election, whereas in the UK an election that was considered a foregone conclusion until last week now looks less certain. Moreover, the economic outlook in the UK is clouded by concerns around whether consumer spending is sustainable, while in the EU things appear to be more upbeat.  This is one area where the contrast with continental Europe is very strong,  said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, Chief Market Strategist at the world's largest asset manager BlackRock (BLK.N).  It's hard to quantify how serious, but we've already seen that since the Brexit referendum, UK consumers have been drawing down their savings to an all-time low savings rate,  Mateos y Lago said. Uk Like Japan? The UK does remain a key market for global investors and offers them access to major commodity producers such as Rio Tinto (RIO.L) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), food and beverage bellwethers Diageo (DGE.L) and Unilever (ULVR.L) and emerging market-focused banking giants like HSBC (HSBA.L) that are not on the continent. Also, companies in the euro zone rely heavily on the UK as a market. For example, about 10 percent of the revenue of top euro zone companies comes directly from the UK, according to data from MSCI, meaning investors will still have to closely monitor the health of the UK. Some say Asia might offer a template for how the investment landscape might evolve.  With Brexit the UK is going to be a bit differentiated. A bit like Japan. It's part of Asia but the difference is material enough to attract separate research,  said Colin McLean, managing director at SVM Asset Management. A big reason for this is that Japan and the rest of Asia can, and often do move independently of each other. John Cryan, the British chief executive of Deutsche Bank, alluded to something similar playing out in Europe, as Brexit negotiations loom.  ...for the medium term, I think the Euro 27 does relatively well,  Cryan said at a financial conference hosted by his bank in New York last week.  The U.K. though, I think is only just coming to terms with the complexity of what a Brexit entails.  For investors, also grappling with these complexities, a Europe ex-UK could make life a little easier.

The order for the new 737 MAX 10 model may, however, include some aircraft originally ordered in a smaller size and upgraded to the proposed new 190-230-seat model, two of them said. Lion Air will be a launch customer for the 737 MAX 10, Lion Air Group President Director Edward Sirait confirmed to Reuters. He did not immediately provide the number of planes it has ordered. Boeing declined to comment.  Indian budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd (SPJT.BO) also is among carriers seen as potential targets for the aircraft, a version designed to seat up to 230 people and blunt strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, two of the sources said. SpiceJet could not immediately be reached for comment. United Airlines (UAL.N) also has been closely studying the aircraft as Boeing pitches for a marquee customer to launch the fifth variant of its 737 MAX family, two other sources said. United Airlines Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz, contacted at an airlines meeting in Mexico, declined to comment. Jet Airways Ltd (JET.NS), India's biggest full service carrier by market share, is in talks to buy 75 single-aisle aircraft from either Airbus (AIR.PA) or Boeing, people familiar with the matter said earlier. If the deal is awarded to Jet's current supplier Boeing, it could include some of the new 737 MAX 10 model. None of the sources agreed to be named because the talks remain confidential. Private Indonesian carrier Lion Air ordered 201 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2012 and placed options for another 150. Such orders typically include the right to convert between different variants of each model. Other airlines are looking at the Boeing 737 MAX 10, but some are nervous about committing to a new variant given patchy sales of some current models of the 737 MAX, whose success rests mainly on sales of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, the sources said. At least one Chinese leasing company is said to be in negotiations with both manufacturers as Airbus tries to disrupt the launch, which sources say is planned for the June 19-25 air show. Airbus declined to comment on any ongoing negotiations. Airbus sales chief John Leahy earlier criticized the 737 MAX 10 as a  marginal  airplane, implying sales would be poor. Boeing marketing vice president Randy Tinseth told Reuters some airlines want more seats than existing versions and that the MAX 10 would be 5 percent more efficient than the Airbus A321neo. Airbus says its own plane is more efficient.      It (the 737 MAX 10) is not a me-too airplane. We are focusing on a better airplane,  Tinseth said on the sidelines of the International Air Travel Association annual meeting in Cancun, Mexico.

If the deal is awarded to Jet's current supplier Boeing, it could include some of the new 737 MAX 10 model. None of the sources agreed to be named because the talks remain confidential. Private Indonesian carrier Lion Air ordered 201 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2012 and placed options for another 150. Such orders typically include the right to convert between different variants of each model. Other airlines are looking at the Boeing 737 MAX 10, but some are nervous about committing to a new variant given patchy sales of some current models of the 737 MAX, whose success rests mainly on sales of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, the sources said. At least one Chinese leasing company is said to be in negotiations with both manufacturers as Airbus tries to disrupt the launch, which sources say is planned for the June 19-25 air show. Airbus declined to comment on any ongoing negotiations. Airbus sales chief John Leahy earlier criticized the 737 MAX 10 as a  marginal  airplane, implying sales would be poor. Boeing marketing vice president Randy Tinseth told Reuters some airlines want more seats than existing versions and that the MAX 10 would be 5 percent more efficient than the Airbus A321neo. Airbus says its own plane is more efficient.      It (the 737 MAX 10) is not a me-too airplane. We are focusing on a better airplane,  Tinseth said on the sidelines of the International Air Travel Association annual meeting in Cancun, Mexico.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain on Monday severed diplomatic relations with Qatar in a coordinated move, accusing Doha of supporting Islamist militants and Iran. Dealers at four local private banks told Reuters they have stopped buying Qatar Riyal.  Our counter-party in Singapore has asked us not to buy Qatar Riyal,  a senior currency dealer at a bank told Reuters. A dealer from a state bank said traders were waiting for the central bank to give guidance about the Qatar Riyal and the bank had been buying the Middle Eastern currency at 39.09 Sri Lankan rupee compared to Monday's close of 39.40.  There is an adjustment in the Qatar Riyal after some banks have stopped buying,  he said. The Sri Lankan central bank in a statement denied it had informed banks  not to accept Qatari Riyals  as reported by some local media. A top central bank official said the central bank will discuss the Qatar Riyal at a meeting on Tuesday. Officials at the island nation's main Bandaranaike International Airport told Reuters passengers had complained that banks at the airport had stopped buying Qatar Riyal. About 50,000 to 60,000 Sri Lankans each year over the past two years have departed the country to work in Qatar, central bank data showed.

Mehndiyan was first built to home a mysterious 19th century religious sect, according to local lore in the Indian capital. But today it forms a warren of improvised homes, graves, and patches of shade where entrepreneurs and holy men sell car parking space, herbal cures and spiritual trinkets. For Ahmed, an 80-year-old transgender woman, the once-desired opportunity to leave this peculiar community for a home among Delhi's apartment blocks now holds little appeal, said Urvashi Butalia, a feminist author and friend of Ahmed. Since she fled her family home in 1955, advances in gender reassignment surgery and LGBT rights have given 'hijras' like Ahmed - male-to-female transsexuals recognized since 2014 as part of India's 'third gender' - new opportunities to integrate. But, to Ahmed, Delhi's boxy flats now resemble prison cells, after a life lived in public, plying hijras' traditional trade of dancing at celebrations, while offering an open door to young transgender people in search of advice, said Butalia.   The once desirable 'normal' life, is not so desirable any more,  Butalia told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview before giving a lecture in London on her two decade friendship with Ahmed.  Ostensibly, she could be living an normal life, but it no longer appeals to her because she can see the loneliness of it.  Hijra Underworld In the last decade, activists such as Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, founder of the Asia Pacific Transgender Network, have raised the public visibility of India's transgender women, who have traditionally been treated with suspicion.  Hijras, who feature in Hindu mythology, have long been considered auspicious in India, where their blessings are sought at weddings and births. But unlike Tripathi, from a wealthy family at the apex of India's caste ladder, many of the country's estimated 2 million transgender people live in poverty. In her youth, Ahmed, like most performing hijras, became an  apostle  of one of a handful of male gurus who run Delhi's hijra underworld, said Butalia, a well-known publisher and academic in India. These patriarchs are the absolute authority in hijra groups, a unique form of  family  that strictly prohibits contact with certain outsiders, including police, she added.   The city is divided up between groups of Hijras who claim certain territories for their own, and they build an extensive network of the underclass - the gardeners, the housekeepers, the shopkeepers and more - who keep them informed of births and marriages, new jobs, new homes and all kinds of auspicious and happy occasions.  In India's mushrooming capital, blessings represent something of a growth industry, she said.  Newly married couples will hand over 20,000 Indian rupees  (around $300) to avoid the public shaming that hijras can bring by exposing their bodies while superstitious industrialists can pay five times that to bless a new factory.  But those who conduct blessings represent the upper echelons of hijra society, while many continue to scrape a living as sex workers or beggars, blocked from renting homes, and often entirely cut off from mainstream society, said Butalia. While young transgender people are no longer forced to go through the painful and dangerous backroom castration that Ahmed endured, public acceptance is still far off, she said. Mona's House Mehndiyan's residents are legally deemed  squatters  and lack titles to recognize their properties, despite many homes having stood for decades.  The graveyard has resisted Delhi's fast-paced urban development as authorities fear protest from religious communities if they were to allow construction on the site, which is also home to two schools of Islamic study.  Ahmed first staked out a plot in the compound in the mid-1980s by making an unverifiable claim that a handful of aged headstones, whose names had been washed clean over time, belonged to her ancestors. From a square barely big enough to sleep on, she now has a house that includes rooms for her nephew and a domestic helper - expanding by taking advantage of others' wariness of hijras. But all this time her door has never been locked and, even after robberies, she welcomes strangers, many young people on the road to becoming hijras, who come in search of advice.  The door is never locked. You just push it open and walk in, and she might be sleeping on her bed but you can go in and watch television while she's sleeping, it makes no difference to her,  said Butalia. Now nearing 81, Ahmed knows her unique home will probably last only as long as she survives before neighbors, unlikely to recognize her nephew's claim to the land, take the space, Butalia said.   Although she doesn't get crowds of people coming there any more, the place is still open and if anyone wants to come they can. She won't turn them away.

Elected pledging to overhaul the healthcare system and slash taxes, Trump has yet to notch a major legislative win, and time is running out before lawmakers leave Washington for August. The White House is trying to spur momentum this week by highlighting policy plans - a task made more difficult with the spotlight on testimony by James Comey, the FBI director fired last month by Trump, to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Comey will be grilled by senators on whether Trump tried to get him to back off an investigation into alleged ties between the president's 2016 campaign and Russia. Trump denies any collusion with Russia, and has called the investigation a  witch hunt.  The White House wants to see Senate Republicans vote on healthcare reform legislation before they leave for a break in August, Marc Short, Trump's top aide on Capitol Hill, told reporters on Monday. The House of Representatives passed a bill in May. Also on tap before the break: A vote to raise the government's borrowing authority, known as the debt limit, should also take place before the break, Short said. Republican fiscal conservatives routinely demand budget cuts and other concessions as a price for raising the debt limit, setting up a likely fight. Congress will then turn its focus to overhauling the tax code in September. While the administration would prefer that the effort not add to the national debt, Short stressed that the top priority would be cutting taxes.  We want it to be revenue neutral, and we are still supportive of tax reform, but I am also saying to you that what we believe is most important to get the economy going is the tax cuts,  he said. The Trump administration has outlined a broad plan that would cut tax rates for businesses and streamline the tax system for individuals. But, the proposal has been short on details -- including the cost of the tax cuts and what loopholes would be closed. The healthcare bill passed by the House could result in 23 million people losing insurance, the Congressional Budget Office estimated, though Republicans have challenged that conclusion. The bill would also reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026, according to the analysis. Short said he believed that the Senate healthcare bill would be  similar  to the House package. Senator John Cornyn, the No.2 Republican in the Senate, said Monday evening he thought there would be a vote on a healthcare bill in the Senate in July.

U.S. officials were blindsided by Saudi Arabia's decision to sever diplomatic ties with Qatar in a coordinated move with Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, the current and former officials said. In announcing the decision to cut ties, Saudi Arabia accused Qatar of providing support to Shi'ite Iran, which is in a tussle for regional supremacy with Riyadh, and to Islamist militants. Washington has many reasons to want to promote comity within the region. Qatar is host to the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East at Al Udeid, a staging ground for U.S.-led strikes on the Islamic State militant group that has seized parts of Syria and Iraq. U.S. Donald Trump has made defeating Islamic State a priority of his presidency. Further, Qatar's willingness to welcome organizations such as Hamas, which Washington brands a terrorist group, and the Taliban, which has fought U.S. forces in Afghanistan for more than 15 years, allows contacts with such groups when needed.  There is a certain utility,  one U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.  There's got to be a place for us to meet the Taliban. The Hamas (folks) have to have a place to go where they can be simultaneously isolated and talked to.  The current and former U.S. officials said they were unable to identify precisely what may have triggered the four countries' coordinated decision to cut ties, which was later followed by Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives. They said the Saudis may have felt empowered by the warm embrace that Trump gave them when he visited Riyadh in May and adopted a harsh anti-Iran stance.  My suspicion is (they felt) emboldened by what Trump said on his visit and ... that they feel they have got some kind of backing,  said a former U.S. official.  I don’t know that they needed any more of a green light than they got in public.  A senior administration official told Reuters the United States got no indication from the Saudis or Emiratis in Riyadh that the action was about to happen. The White House said on Monday it was committed to working to de-escalate tensions in the Gulf. In Riyadh, Trump made an impassioned appeal to Arab and Islamic leaders to  drive out  terrorists, while singling out Iran as a key source of funding and support for militant groups. Seeking Reconciliation U.S. officials in multiple agencies stressed their desire to promote a reconciliation between the Saudi-led group and Qatar, a state of 2.5 million people with vast natural gas reserves.  We don't want to see some kind of permanent rift and I suspect we won't,  said the senior Trump administration official on condition of anonymity, adding the United States would send a representative if the Gulf Cooperation Council nations met to discuss the rift with Qatar. The GCC includes six wealthy Arab nations: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.  There’s an acknowledgement that a lot of Qatari behavior is quite worrisome not just to our Gulf neighbors but to the U.S.,  said the senior administration official.  We want to bring them in the right direction.  Marcelle Wahba, a former U.S. ambassador to the UAE and the president of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington think tank, said the United States had leverage but would use it discreetly.  The U.S. will step up to the plate. How we will do it? I think it will be very quiet and very much in the background,  she said.  I doubt very much we will sit on the sidelines and let this crisis get more serious.  Qatar's backing of Islamists dates to a decision by the current ruling emir's father to end a tradition of automatic deference to Saudi Arabia, the dominant Gulf Arab power, and forge the widest possible array of allies. Qatar has for years presented itself as a mediator and power broker for the region's many disputes. But Egypt and the Gulf Arab states resent Qatar's support for Islamists, especially the Muslim Brotherhood, which they see as a political enemy.  We are engaging with all of our partners ... to find a way to reassemble some GCC unity to support regional security,  said another U.S. official, saying it was critical to  maintain the fight against terrorism and extremist ideology.

The CSI300 index rose 0.1 percent, to 3,471.28 points at the end of the morning session, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent, to 3,084.95 points. China's economy is likely to have remained on a stable footing in May, buoyed by solid gains in trade and investment as economic ties with the United States take a positive turn and infrastructure spending cushions domestic growth. A Reuters poll of indicators from trade and industrial output to loans and property investment, is expected to show that economic growth held up nicely into the second quarter, defying worries of a sharp slowdown. However, sentiment was dampened after state media reported that the securities regulator would maintain a stable and firm policy regarding new listings, raising concerns among investors that the pace of IPOs would not be rolled back as expected.  Currently, valuations of many listed companies are still quite high, in particular small caps,  said Zhang Qi, an analyst with Haitong Securities. Expectations of more equity supply could weigh on those small-cap stocks, according to many analysts Reuters spoke to. Sector performance was mixed in the morning. Gains were led by real estate stocks, while losses were seen in energy and utilities-related companies. In Hong Kong, the broader market rose on strong gains in property developers.

Jiang Tianyong defended high-profile dissidents and practitioners of Falun Gong, the banned spiritual movement, before being disbarred in 2009. He continued to speak out against government crackdowns on rights lawyers. Jiang disappeared in November 2016 after traveling to central China's Changsha city to provide advice and support to a fellow rights lawyer, Xie Yang. In December, authorities confirmed they were holding Jiang on suspicion of inciting subversion. On Monday, six months later, the longest a suspect can be held without charge under Chinese law, his father received an official charge notice in the post, according to Jiang's wife, Jin Bianling, who now lives in the United States. The notice, dated May 31, said Jiang was being held on suspicion of subverting state power, a more serious crime, and was being held in Changsha City Number One Detention Centre, according to photos of the document seen by Reuters. The notice is the first official confirmation of Jiang's whereabouts that she or his parents have had in six months, Jin told Reuters by phone. Jin said she was worried about Jiang's treatment in custody and believes authorities may be attempting to force him to confess. No one answered the publicly listed phone number for the Changsha detention center.    In May, Jin said that Jiang may have been tortured until he was unable to stand. The authorities released a video of Jiang walking in shorts to refute the claim, which she said was unconvincing.     China has vowed to deal with problems of torture, beatings and forced confessions in its criminal justice system.  The crimes he (Jiang) is suspected of keep changing,  Jin said.  It seems Jiang Tianyong has not admitted to any crimes, so they are going to keep torturing him until he confesses.  Although Jiang's family and lawyers have been unable to speak to him, state media released a number of interviews with Jiang in March, where he appeared to confess to having helped fabricate accounts of Xie Yang being tortured. Xie later denied he was harmed during a public trial in early May, where he admitted to charges of subverting state power. Jin says that the state media accounts of what Jiang said were either themselves fabricated or evidence of Jiang being pressured by the authorities into giving false testimony.

Adani, which hopes to secure a A$900 million ($670 million) government loan, said in a statement it had given  final investment decision approval  to build what would be Australia's biggest coal mine.  We are committed to this project,  Adani Chairman Gautam Adani said. The Carmichael mine has faced years of delays amid opposition from environment groups who argue it will contribute to global warming and damage the Great Barrier Reef, leading some banks to rule out any role in funding.  Announcing an intention to invest is a far cry from having the finance to do so,  said Julien Vincent, executive director of environmental finance organization Market Forces. Greenpeace Australia Pacific said the announcement was a  PR stunt . The project is located in the remote Galilee Basin, a 247,000 square-kilometer (95,000 square mile) expanse in the central outback that some believe has the potential to become Australia's largest coal-producing region. Adani said the project would create 10,000 direct and indirect jobs, with pre-construction works starting in the next few months. Coal from the mine will be exported to India. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said Australia's third biggest state had been hit by a global resources downturn and Adani's decision would help mining firms. Adani's decision  is a vote of confidence not just in the Queensland economy, but in Queensland people , she said. However, one energy analyst said the huge project would drive down thermal coal prices if it was built, putting pressure on local rivals.  The Queensland government probably doesn't appreciate that they could lose thermal mines in Queensland for the sake of bringing in this one,  said the analyst, who asked not to be named as he was not authorized to comment on Adani. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, the federal agency that will decide whether to grant the government loan to Adani, was not immediately available for comment.

But, sure enough, two batters into the first inning, the Giants were in trouble again. When Orlando Calixte's attempt to hit the cutoff man on a routine sac fly sailed past catcher Buster Posey and lodged in between the netting and advertising behind home plate, it could have been the start of an ugly night for Jeff Samardzija and the Giants. Instead, Samardzija took a deep breath, locked in and went back to work. He retired the next 18 batters and gave his offense time to find its own rhythm as the Giants took the series opener 7-2 at Miller Park.  I liked how I was warming up and I liked some of the pitches I had made,  Samardzija (2-7) said.  I didn't like the pitch to (leadoff batter) Eric Sogard, but we just kept pitching. There wasn't too much reason to panic. It was early in the game and I was just trying to get some outs.  Related CoveragePreview: Giants at BrewersSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchSamardzija struck out 10, while allowing two runs (one earned) on six hits with no walks in 7 2/3 innings. Joe Panik got San Francisco on the board with an RBI single in the fourth, and Eduardo Nunez tied the game at 2 with a solo home run in the fifth inning, his fourth of the season. However, it was Aaron Hill who provided the big hit, driving in a pair with a pinch-hit double in the eighth that broke a 2-2 tie.  That's not the way we wanted to start here but what a job (Samardzija) did,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  He just pitched a terrific game. He had good command, good velocity. Great changeup, cutter too. Good for him to get a win. He should have a few more wins. Good we found a way to score some runs for him.  Junior Guerra only lasted five innings for the Brewers, allowing two runs (one earned) on seven hits with three walks while striking out two, but once again, the Brewers' bullpen couldn't come through in the clutch. Rob Scahill (1-2) worked a quick seventh but got into trouble in the eighth, allowing a leadoff single to Brandon Belt. Posey grounded into a force at second, but Brandon Crawford drew a walk and Scahill gave Panik a free pass, setting the stage for Hill's big moment.  We've got to find some guys to get some outs down there,  said Brewers manager Craig Counsell, whose relievers lead baseball with 17 losses this season.  Rob did a nice job. He was a pitch away from getting out of the inning but it was a big spot where you've got to make a pitch.  The Brewers still had a chance heading into the ninth, only down two, but struggling right-hander Neftali Feliz, who had been demoted from the closer's role on May 12, let the game get out of hand quickly, loading the bases without retiring a batter. An error on center fielder Brett Phillips didn't help the situation, but Belt made it a 5-2 game with an RBI single and, after Posey drove in another on a groundout, Feliz reloaded the bases with an intentional walk. Nunez scored on Hunter Pence's groundout to put the Giants up five before Feliz finally got out of it.  (Neftali) is getting stuck in these innings for sure,  Counsell said.  He's falling behind with his best pitch and that's what's really hurting him. His fastball, that's his pitch. He's going to rely on it. They know it's coming. I think ahead in the count is where it has to be.  NOTES: Milwaukee placed 3B Travis Shaw on the paternity list and selected the contract of OF Brett Phillips from Triple-A Colorado Springs. Phillips was in the starting lineup for his major league debut and recorded his first big league hit with a leadoff single in the eighth. ... Giants OF Hunter Pence made his first start since returning from the 10-day disabled list and went 1-for-4. ... Brewers manager Craig Counsell said RHP Matt Garza was feeling much better Monday and was likely to make his next scheduled start Thursday against the Giants. Garza sustained a chest contusion Sunday when he collided with 1B Jesus Aguilar while trying to make a play at first base. ...

Odubel Herrera, emerging from a lengthy slump, had a home run and two doubles for the second straight game, and Tommy Joseph and Aaron Altherr also homered in Philadelphia's 11-4 win in its first visit to SunTrust Park.  I liked the ballpark at first sight, and I think our hitters liked the ballpark,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  We've swung the bats well for three games now. ... Hitting is contagious. That's what I'm hoping for.  The Phillies (20-35) have scored 25 runs in a three-game winning streak that began with two home victories over San Francisco after 25 losses in the previous 31 games. Joseph and Altherr joined Herrera with three hits, and both had three RBIs. Herrera has been the focus of the offensive revival, though.  He looks like the guy we know he can be, and it's great to see,  Mackanin said. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at BravesPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchJoseph said of Herrera,  It's been pretty awesome to watch. Any time he swings the stick, it's a barrel. Good for him. He's a big weapon at the top of the order because he can do so much, so it is good to get him going.  The Phillies' outburst gave rookie right-hander Nick Pivetta his first major league victory. Recalled from Triple-A to take the place of injured starter Vince Velasquez, Pivetta (1-2) allowed six hits and three runs in five innings. He walked three and struck out four in his fifth major league start. Colon (2-7) gave eight runs in 3 2/3 innings and is in jeopardy of losing his spot in the Braves' rotation. He signed for $12.5 million as a free agent after making the All-Star Game for the fourth time last year while with the New York Mets.  We've got to think about it going forward,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said when asked Colon's rotation standing.  I haven't made a decision about the next one. We'll see.  Seven of the nine runs Colon gave up in 2 1/3 innings in his previous start against the Los Angeles Angels were unearned, but the Atlanta defense didn't have a hand in his demise this time. Colon surrendered seven hits -- six of them for extra bases -- and opponents are batting .332 against him. He also walked two to go with four strikeouts as his already-high ERA jumped to 7.78.  Right now, I'm in a bad streak,  Colon said through a translator.  My entire career I've never had a start to a season that has gone this way. That's baseball. I have to keep going and get out of it.  Ender Inciarte, who went 5-for-5 with a homer and five RBIs at Cincinnati on Sunday, was the only bright spot for the Braves (24-31). The center fielder walked his first two times up and then had hits in his next two at-bats before bouncing out to end the game. Colon was 10-3 with a 3.01 ERA against Philadelphia the past three seasons while with the New York Mets, but the Phillies gave the 44-year-old right-hander a second straight pounding as a Brave.  His location obviously isn't what it has been in the past,  Mackanin said. Herrera doubled to start the Phillies' three-run first inning. He scored on a single by Altherr, and then Joseph pulled a towering two-run homer down the left field line on the first pitch he saw from Colon. Joseph had an RBI double in the third inning. Colon couldn't get out of the fourth, giving up a run-scoring double to Andrew Knapp and a two-run single by Cesar Hernandez. Reliever Sam Freeman served up a two-run homer to Herrera to complete the five-run inning. NOTES: Braves LHP Jamie Garcia (2-3, 3.18 ERA) will start the second game of the four-game series on Tuesday against Phillies RHP Aaron Nola (2-3, 5.06 ERA). ... On Sunday at Cincinnati, CF Ender Inciarte became just the fourth Atlanta player to have multiple five-hit games in the same season. Kenny Lofton accomplished it three times in 1997. Felix Milan (1970), Gerald Perry (1986) and Fred McGriff (1996) did it twice. ... Atlanta native Jeff Francoeur, who played for both the Braves and Phillies, made his TV broadcasting debut as an analyst on the Braves' pregame and postgame shows. He retired after not finding a playing opportunity this season.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-phillies-braves-writethru-idUSMTZED663VU5MA"},

The purchase of the stake in the Cote Gold Project in Ontario comes as Japan's biggest gold miner looks to boost its output through acquisitions and exploration. IAMGOLD owns 92.5 percent of the project, currently in its so-called pre-feasiblity study phase. Production is slated to begin in 2021, with the development expected to churn out 168 tonnes of gold over a 17-year life.  With this deal, we will make progress towards our long-term goal of boosting gold output from our equity holdings to 30 tonnes a year,  Naoyuki Tsuchida, Sumitomo Metals senior managing executive officer, told a news conference. The deal is expected to complete by the end of September. The company said the project would boost its annual gold output to nearly 18 tonnes from 15 tonnes now.  Since this project is located in the Abitibi gold belt in eastern Canada, which is one of the world's largest gold-producing areas, there may be additional reserves, depending on future exploration,  Tsuchida said. Yoshiaki Nakazato, president of Sumitomo Metal, which is also miner and smelter of copper and nickel, said last month that the firm was still willing to invest in gold mines despite the record loss it booked in the fiscal year to March 2017.
