The dairy, which has admitted facing  tremendous difficulties  getting a clear picture of its finances, said in a filing to the Hong Kong exchange it was ultimately looking for a  white knight  to financially support the firm. Huishan's woes came to light when its stock plunged 85 percent in March before being suspended. Since then most of its directors have quit, it has missed loan payments and lost contact with a key executive in charge of its finances and cash. As of March 31, Huishan owed $3.9 billion to creditors including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China Ltd and HSBC. It has hired debt restructuring advisers and forensic accountants to investigate gaps in its financial statements. The firm, billed as China's largest integrated dairy firm, said the restructuring plans would involve creating a new holding company that would include Huishan's businesses and assets and some separate firms controlled by Chairman Yang Kai. This would then be wholly owned by the listed unit, which would be controlled by the mix of creditors, current shareholders and management, with stakes yet to be negotiated. The plans - key to Huishan's survival - are the latest twist in a rapid fall from grace that has laid bare the risks of excess leverage and financial engineering in corporate China. Under the proposed plans, which would need the support of Huishan's creditors, the management team would continue to play a role  pending the eventual identification of a white knight to recapitalize the newly established group , the firm said.

Havana, the capital of the Caribbean island, boasted dozens of such  posadas  until the 1990s, when the remaining few were given to Cubans left homeless by hurricanes. Privacy has became all the more elusive for lovers, given a housing shortage that forces many families to live in the same apartment and couples to live together long after their divorce. Private establishments have filled in the gap for some, the trade union weekly wrote, but many cannot afford to pay around $5, or a sixth of the average monthly state wage, for three hours of bliss. The less fortunate must resort to  parks, dark staircases, the beach and even the Malecon (seafront),  Trabajadores wrote. But now the state wants to make lovemaking easier again.  We want to revive this service that is in high demand, has a big social impact and without a doubt is very profitable,  Alfonso Muñoz Chang of the Provincial Housing Company of Havana was cited as saying.  We will start with what we call Hotel Vento, a two-storey building with 16 rooms with bathrooms.   The city needs this,  Hotel Vento administrator Maria Sterling was cited as saying, noting that employees would be  very enthusiastic  as wages would likely rise with the extra work. Next, authorities will restore some once-famous love motels like La Monumental to their former glory and convert another hotel, Muñoz Chang said.  To think about how to diversify options for love is not farfetched,  Trabajadores wrote.  It is a reality that concerns everyone, and cannot become a luxury.

Regulators and market participants say the agencies were slow to adjust ratings on some companies that subsequently defaulted, including Amtek Auto Ltd in 2015. Their concerns have grown as markets have witnessed a record-setting surge in corporate bond sales.  We are not happy with the current state of affairs of rating agencies,  Tyagi told reporters in the sidelines of an event. The Securities and Exchange Board of India said on Friday that under the new rules agencies must monitor more closely whether issuers are meeting their debt obligations, and increasing disclosure requirements. Tyagi said the regulator was considering a further set of proposed regulations, adding it would issue a discussion paper  within a month.  He did not provide any specifics. Rating agencies on Monday declined to comment on SEBI's proposals. A source at one of India's four major rating agencies said that the timing of the rules had come as a surprise and that the company was still  trying to figure what this would mean for us.  He said the company would contact SEBI for additional clarifications and was not aware of any pending regulations. India has four major rating agencies, of which three are majority-owned by the big three global agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service. But they operate independently of their parent companies with different rating standards. Corporate bond issuance surged 37.2 percent to 2 trillion rupees in the first half of 2017, the highest first-half figure since records began in 2000, according to Thomson Reuters data. Late last year, SEBI tightened disclosure norms for credit rating agencies in a bid to boost transparency and accountability. Global regulators have been cracking down on credit rating agencies in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, which many say was a result of inflated ratings assigned by agencies on complex mortgage-backed securities.

China's  sharing economy  is expected to grow about 40 percent this year to 4.83 trillion yuan ($705 billion). By 2020, it could account for around one tenth of China's gross domestic product. The explosive growth of the sector has been seen in the large spurts of funding Chinese bike-sharing firms such as Mobike and ofo have received. But the relatively new industry faces growing challenges, such as regulatory frameworks that fail to keep apace of advances in technology and insufficient social security provided for contractors and freelancers, China's economic planner said in a statement posted on its website late on Monday. Existing restrictions on market entry should be further relaxed or eliminated, while new policies should be launched with caution, the department said.  We should avoid using the old method to regulate a new format of business and we should break down industry and geographic barriers for it,  it said, adding that governments should step up regulatory control and increase policy transparency. The guidelines also urged local policymakers to crack down on intellectual property right violations, better protect consumer rights, and enhance contract workers' social security. The statement was co-issued by eight central government entities, including the National Development and Reform Commission, Cyberspace Administration of China, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.

Now it appears most pitches coming out of Tanaka's right hand are succeeding. It was apparent Monday night when Tanaka pitched seven solid innings as the New York Yankees added four crucial insurance runs in the bottom of the eighth inning and held on for a 6-3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays.  Without going into too much details, it's just being able to make the right adjustments,  Tanaka said through an interpreter.  I feel a little bit better on the mound.  Tanaka (7-7) won his second straight start by allowing one run and five hits. He struck out eight, walked one and threw 111 pitches as the Yankees (44-37) closed out the first half with their sixth win in 20 games.  His four pitches were good,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  It's the difference. His four pitches, he's using them all. They've all been good and they've all gotten outs for him.  Tanaka's latest outing gave him a 2-0 record and a 1.29 ERA in his last three outings, which leads Girardi to believe his ace might be hitting a groove after watching him throw first-pitch strikes to the first eight hitters and to 21 of 27 hitters overall. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at YankeesToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatch When you put three of them together that are very similar where his stuff is outstanding, you feel a lot better about where he's at,  Girardi said.  We said a lot of times when he was struggling, he didn't have his slider, he didn't have his split, and some days he didn't have both. But he's had them all and he's had his curveball, which he used effectively as well and it just makes a huge difference.  Tanaka pitched with a 2-0 lead most of the night after Chase Headley was hit by a pitch and Jacoby Ellsbury walked with the bases loaded in the first inning against Marcus Stroman (8-5). After getting the lead, Tanaka recorded key outs all night. Justin Smoak opened the fourth with a double off the left-field wall but stayed at second base as the inning ended with Ezequiel Carrera striking out. An inning earlier, Tanaka stranded Jose Bautista at first when Josh Donaldson grounded out. In the fifth, Tanaka stranded Luke Maile at third by striking out Bautista on three straight pitches. The Blue Jays ended Tanaka's shutout bid when Darwin Barney lifted a single to left after a throwing error by Gary Sanchez allowed Carrera to take third following a stolen base. Tanaka finished it by cleanly fielding two grounders.  He's coming out of it, you can tell,  Toronto left fielder Steve Pearce said. After Tanaka's outing ended, the last final two innings were slightly stressful for the Yankees. Dellin Betances pitched a scoreless eighth by striking out Bautista and Smoak on 99 mph full-count fastballs. Smoak struck out as catcher Sanchez made a perfect throw to nab Donaldson trying to steal second. Aroldis Chapman allowed a run-scoring double to Kevin Pillar and an RBI single to Barney. He also threw a wild pitch but retired pinch-hitters Troy Tulowitzki and Russell Martin with the tying run on deck. Chapman's appearance occurred after the Yankees added four in the eighth against Ryan Tepera. Headley made it 4-1 with a two-run double. New York scored its final two runs when Didi Gregorius and Headley scored on a soft grounder to the mound as catcher Maile dropped the throw from Tepera. The eighth was the latest event in a frustrating two weeks for the Blue Jays, who lost their fifth straight and fell to 2-9 in their last 11 games. It also occurred after Stroman exited with a blister on his right hand. He allowed two runs and five hits in five innings.  It's crazy,  Stroman said.  It's extremely frustrating. I feel like it's an epidemic that's happening across the big leagues now.  NOTES: Toronto manager John Gibbons said C Miguel Montero will join the team in time for Tuesday afternoon's game. ... Yankees GM Brian Cashman said  exploratory surgery  is possible for Greg Bird (bruised right ankle) if he still experiences pain. ... Toronto RHP Aaron Sanchez (blister) pitched 4 1/3 innings in a rehab start for Triple-A Buffalo on Sunday and it's possible he could be activated from the disabled list this weekend. ... New York LHP CC Sabathia (strained left hamstring) confirmed that he will be activated from the disabled list and pitch Tuesday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-bluejays-yankees-writethru-idUSMTZED74JOSK1C"},

The army general command said in a statement carried on state television the ceasefire began at midday (0900 GMT) on Sunday and was to support  reconciliation efforts , in the second such unilateral ceasefire in the last two weeks. Hours after the announcement, rebels and witnesses said Syrian jets resumed dropping barrel bombs - drums or cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel that cause indiscriminate destruction on the ground - on rebel-held areas in the southern border city of Deraa, the town of Naima to its east and countryside near the provincial city. There was no immediate comment from the army on the rebel allegations.  Russian-sponsored talks are planned in Astana on Tuesday. The last round of Astana talks in May led to the signing of an agreement between Iran, Russia and Turkey to create four de-escalation zones in Syria, one of which is in the south. But the Syrian army has in recent months escalated its strikes in Deraa in a campaign to reach the border with Jordan and wrest full control of the city.  Related CoverageU.S.-backed forces breach Raqqa's old city in Syria, coalition saysHostilities have expanded to the border province of Quneitra along the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights where rebels are waging an offensive against the army and Iranian-backed militias in the strategic border area. A rebel official said the latest ceasefire was a ploy to drag the opposition to Astana. The rebel side has already expressed deep misgivings about the de-escalation zones, which they say benefit the Syrian army by freeing forces to allow them to make territorial gains elsewhere. The Syrian opposition and rebel groups accuse Russia of abetting the Syrian army in its major offensive to wrest full control of Deraa. FILE PHOTO: A general view shows damaged buildings in a rebel-held part of the southern city of Deraa, Syria June 22, 2017.Alaa Al-Faqir/File PhotoSome rebel factions are expected to be absent from the Astana talks because of what many see as Russia's unwillingness to end air strikes and its failure to get the Syrian army and Iranian backed militias to abide by a ceasefire, a rebel source said.   This ceasefire is an attempt by the Russians and the regime to bring back the opposition to Astana and give them assurances on the ground they will stop the shelling on condition they attend,  said Sohaib Alraheel, spokesman of Liwa al Furqan Brigades, a faction of the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA) operating in southwest Syria. Major Issam al Rayes, spokesman for the Southern Front, a coalition of Western-backed FSA rebel groups, said shortly after the ceasefire announcement the armed opposition were  very distrustful  of the Syrian army's willingness to abide by the ceasefire or Russia's readiness to rein in it's ally.  FILE PHOTO: A rebel fighter walks past damaged buildings in a rebel-held part of the southern city of Deraa, Syria June 22, 2017.Alaa Al-Faqir/File PhotoThe renewed aerial strikes and artillery shelling by the army only went to prove their earlier doubts, Rayes said.  We had cast doubt on the ceasefire the moment it was announced and knew it would not be different from previous ones. The regime is lying and the Russians are lying and are not serious in achieving a ceasefire,  al Rayes told Reuters.  The Russians are duplicitous and procrastinating and are part of the problem and so cannot be part of it solution,  Rayes added.  The latest announcement for the first time extends the ceasefire to the whole of southern Syria, including southwestern Quneitra province near the border with Israel and Sweida province in the southeast.     The United States and Russia have held secret talks on creating a  de-escalation zone  in southern Syria, Western diplomats and regional officials said in early June. The Israeli army has in recent days launched strikes against Syrian army outposts in the southwest, where the Iranian-backed Hezbollah has a strong presence, saying it was retaliating for errant fire from Syrian positions that landed in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights.

Yet that is the reality facing 84th-ranked Alexandr Dolgopolov when the Ukrainian faces one of Wimbledon's all-time favorite sons in Tuesday's first round match on Center Court.

Just days later, he put a full stop to his 2016 season, saying he needed time to receive  more extensive rehabilitation  on his stricken knee which had required surgery months earlier.

After capturing a record 18th grand slam trophy at the Australian Open in January, he is once again proving to be a formidable force -- winning back-to-back titles at Indian Wells and Miami for the first time since 2006. While he shunned the entire claycourt season to give himself  the best chance for Wimbledon , a ninth title at the Halle grasscourt tournament has put him in the zone for Wimbledon.  I don't want to be at the mercy of my opponent. I want to take charge, play aggressive myself,  Federer, seeking his first title here since 2012, told reporters.   So for that I need to be fast on my feet and quick in my mind. I just need enough rest so I can play enough inspired tennis.  Considering Dolgopolov has not taken a set off Federer in three meetings, the chances are he will be cannon fodder for the Swiss as Federer begins the pursuit of a record eighth Wimbledon title and a record 85th match win at the grasscourt major.

Nola turned in one of the finest starts of his major league career, carrying a no-hitter into the fifth inning on his way to seven scoreless innings. The outing was the latest in a strong stretch for Nola, who was backed with two-run homers from Freddy Galvis and Maikel Franco. Together, they helped the Phillies to their fourth win in six games after they dropped 16 of their previous 19. Nola had a no-hitter until two outs in the fifth inning when Jordy Mercer lined a double down the left-field line and just beyond the reach of Franco at third base. Nola (6-5) allowed four hits, walked one and struck out eight, continuing a string of strong starts. He kept the Pirates off the bases, and when he got into trouble, the right-hander got out of jams with punchouts.  Nola was outstanding,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  He's had several good outings now. I think he's turned the corner. I think he's pitching the way he's capable of.  Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at PhilliesPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchJoaquin Benoit and Hector Neris each pitched a scoreless inning to complete the shutout. The toughest spot of the game for Nola came in the seventh inning after Gregory Polanco singled on a fly ball that fell between second baseman Andres Blanco and right fielder Nick Williams. With two on and no outs, Nola got Francisco Cervelli to ground out before striking out Mercer and pinch-hitter John Jaso -- the last two batters he faced -- to end the inning with runners at the corners.  I felt strong at the end,  Nola said.  I wanted a double play ball in there, somewhere in that inning. But it worked out well.  Nola, who missed a month earlier this season with a lower back strain and had his 2016 season end in July because of an elbow injury, has returned to form in the last two weeks. The Phillies' 2014 first-round draft pick has gone at least seven innings in each of his last three starts and has allowed just 13 hits and three earned runs in 21 1/3 innings (1.27 ERA) while notching 25 strikeouts (10.5 strikeouts per nine innings).  I've had a lot of first-pitch strikes and I'm getting the leadoff hitter out a lot,  Nola said of his recent success.  I think those are the big keys in the last couple of starts that I've been doing really well.  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said,  There's not a lot of waiting him out because it was strike one or it was two of the first three pitches were strikes. A lot of offensive counts for him, pitcher's counts. We were having to do a lot of reactive hitting.  The Pirates have scored just four runs in their last three games and Monday's loss was their fourth in a row. Pittsburgh starter Ivan Nova (8-6) gave up seven hits in six innings, but two of them were long balls.  Wasn't sharp coming out of the gate, didn't have a curveball until the fourth inning really,  Hurdle said of Nova.   He still went out there and kept us in the game, in this ballpark. Four runs isn't an insurmountable lead.  Galvis got the scoring started in the first inning, launching the first pitch he saw from Nova into the right-field bleachers for a two-run shot. Galvis' homer, his eighth of the season, came on the same day he and his wife, Ana, had their second daughter, Nicole.  Long day. I don't know how (I had the energy),  said Galvis, who was at the hospital at 3 a.m. before his daughter was born around 5:30.  I just tried to do one thing at a time. Get a few hours of sleep and come back here. I saw everything was good (with the baby). So I got here and tried to help the team.  Franco doubled the Phillies' lead to 4-0 when his hard-hit line drive cleared the wall in left field in the third inning for his 11th home run of the season. NOTES: Pirates OF Andrew McCutchen was named the National League Player of the Month for June. McCutchen hit .411 with a 1.193 OPS and 12 extra-base hits in 26 games. It was the fifth Player of the Month honor of his career. ... The Pirates activated C Francisco Cervelli off the disabled list and optioned RHP Edgar Santana to Triple-A Indianapolis. Cervelli was in the Pirates' starting lineup, his first game since June 19. He went 0-for-3.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-pirates-phillies-writethru-idUSMTZED74JN7WY9"},

Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has claimed that its partner has breached joint venture contracts as it pursues an $18 billion sale of the unit and is seeking an injunction to prevent any deal without its consent.[nL3N1JC082] In its filing with the Superior Court of California, Toshiba argued that their joint venture interests only cover a small portion of its flash memory semiconductor business and that the court has no jurisdiction as its primary place of business was Japan. Toshiba is scrambling to get a deal done as fast as possible as it needs funds to cover billions in cost overruns at now-bankrupt unit Westinghouse. It is currently negotiating with a preferred bidder consortium that includes Japan government investors and U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital.  Even if an agreement is reached with a bidder...if Toshiba is prevented from moving forward on implementing that transaction, the harm to an overall deal would be severe - and may well make the implementation of a transaction impossible,  said in its filing, which was made on Friday. Western Digital has tabled its own bid for the chip unit - the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips - but the offer has gained little traction with Toshiba, which says it raises anti-trust concerns. The Japanese firm is also reluctant to engage with Western Digital as its U.S. partner has said in the past it wants to take control of the unit. Western Digital argues that an injunction will ensure that an international arbitration court will be given an appropriate opportunity to resolve their dispute. The court hearing on the issue is scheduled for July 14 and Western Digital has said it believes a decision could come on the same day. Western Digital is expected to file a response to Toshiba's opposition before the hearing.

Now hitting at the top of the order, Goodwin was a game-changer with his play in left field on Monday night. The left fielder threw out a runner at the plate in the eighth inning, and the Washington Nationals beat the New York Mets 3-2 with a walk-off single in the last of the ninth by reserve Ryan Raburn. Neither team scored early, as New York's Steven Matz and Washington's Stephen Strasburg each exited after seven shutout innings. Goodwin was a reserve early in the year but is seeing more playing time with the injury to veteran left fielder Jayson Werth.  We go out there and want to succeed,  said Goodwin, who was batting first after leadoff man Trea Turner injured his wrist Thursday.  We believe in our guys. We are very resilient. We have plenty of people in the lineup that can deliver.  The hit by Raburn not only beat the Mets but may have helped cause an injury to slugging left fielder Yoenis Cespedes, who came up limping after he nearly made a shoestring catch for the third out in the ninth.  He said he just cramped up more than anything on the slide. Coming back as early as we are tomorrow, I'd be surprised if he's in there,  Mets manager Terry Collins said of the Tuesday morning start. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at NationalsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchSaid Cespedes, through a translator:  It's just a cramp. It could have happened to anybody.  New York trimmed a few games off the Washington lead in the past week, only to lose a golden chance to gain a game Monday night before a sellout crowd.  Against a lineup like that, you can't walk guys,  Collins said of walks that led to two of the three Washington runs.  They can hit. But you can't walk them because that just turns that lineup over and brings those guys up, and you don't want them coming up.  The Nationals won after another bullpen failure, as Matt Albers gave up a two-run homer on a 0-2 pitch with two outs in the top of the ninth to Curtis Granderson that tied the game at 2. Washington entered the game with a 5.12 bullpen ERA, the worst in the National League. However, the Nationals' offense came through with the team's sixth walk-off win of the year.  Biggest downer in baseball -- blown save late,  Washington manager Dusty Baker said.  I don't want to belabor the fact. We are going to get our bullpen fixed.  Collins said before the game that Granderson may not play due to a sore hip. However, the veteran outfielder came off the bench to smash the pinch-hit homer with his team one strike away from a 2-0 loss.  Granderson, according to our report, was hurt,  Baker said. The hit by Raburn off Fernando Salas to shallow left scored Matt Wieters, who led off the ninth with a walk, took second on a walk by pinch hitter Stephen Drew and went to third on a flyout by pinch hitter Adam Lind. The winning pitcher was Albers (4-1), who gave up two runs in the ninth. Paul Sewald (0-3) was hit with the loss as he allowed the walk to Wieters. Michael A. Taylor smashed a two-run homer in the eighth to give the Nationals a 2-0 lead after a walk to Raburn. Strasburg allowed two singles and three walks while striking out six. He was replaced in the top of the eighth by lefty Matt Grace, who gave up a leadoff infield single by Brandon Nimmo. Nimmo went to second on a sacrifice bunt by Matz but was thrown out at home by Goodwin following a single by Jose Reyes. The call stood after a challenge by the Mets.  You want to get to it as fast as possible, but you want to be under control,  Goodwin said.  I am charging as hard as possible.  Grace walked Asdrubal Cabrera. The Nationals then brought on Joe Blanton, who retired Cespedes on a fielder's choice to end the inning. Matz allowed four hits and two walks. He fanned four. The first-place Nationals (49-34) are eight games ahead of the second-place Atlanta Braves (40-41) and 10 1/2 games ahead of the third-place Mets (38-44) in the National League East. Reyes had two hits for the Mets.  It was a good win for us,  Strasburg said. NOTES: The Nationals held a moment of silence before the game for David Vincent, who died Sunday at the age of 67 due to stomach cancer. Vincent was the official scorer for the first home game in Nationals history at RFK Stadium in 2005, and he worked his last game at Nationals Park on June 12. ... Mets LHP Seth Lugo (3-1, 3.55) will face Washington RHP Joe Ross (4-3, 5.12) on Tuesday at 11:05 a.m. ET. ... Washington RHP Max Scherzer was named the National League Pitcher of the Month for June.

The notes are issued by CSCEC Finance II, and unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd (CSCECL; A/Stable). CSCEC Finance II is a 100%-owned subsidiary of CSCECL. The notes are rated at the same level as CSCECL's senior unsecured debt rating as they represent direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company. The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received and the final rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 21 June 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS Ratings Reflect State Ties: Fitch has notched CSCECL's IDR three levels above its standalone assessment of 'BBB', to reflect CSCECL's moderate operational and strategic ties with the central government through its 56.26% parent China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), which is wholly owned by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. In assigning the standalone rating, Fitch analysed CSCECL's financials after deconsolidating its property development subsidiary, China Overseas Land & Investment Limited (COLI; A-/Stable). Market Position Unchanged: CSCECL's market position and its leadership in different construction segments have remained unchanged and continue to be supported by its linkages to China's central government. CSCECL was involved in building 85% of the medium to large airports in China and 90% of the super high-rise buildings, which are more than 300 metres tall, in the country. CSCECL is one of only two companies qualified to construct nuclear islands, and one of five licensed to build railways in China. Robust Backlog-to-Revenue Ratio: CSCECL's ratio of order backlog to revenue has remained at an average of around 3.0x in the recent three years, which adds a degree of visibility to its revenue and EBITDA. CSCECL's new contract growth accelerated to 24% in 2016. In particular, housing construction - which accounts for about 69% of the new contracts - increased by 8%, and infrastructure construction (accounting for 31%) increased by 83%. We expect new-contract growth in housing construction to slow in 2017 amid a government clampdown on property investment, and in infrastructure to remain high, driven by public-private partnership (PPP) investment. Solid Performance in 2016: CSCECL's revenue (deconsolidated) increased by 12% in 2016, compared with a 9% rise in the previous year. This was mainly driven by strong growth of 23% in infrastructure sales. Its EBITDA (deconsolidated) margin remained stable at around 5%. PPP Projects to Drive Growth: The Chinese government has been encouraging the PPP model over the past two years. The Ministry of Finance recently approved the third batch of pilot PPP projects, which will invest a total of CNY1.2 trillion, 80% more than the second batch. We believe PPP projects will continue to be the main stimulus of new contract and revenue growth for the company. DERIVATION SUMMARY Fitch has notched CSCECL's IDR three levels above its standalone assessment of 'BBB', to reflect CSCECL's moderate operational and strategic ties with the central government. CSCECL is the largest construction company in China with leadership positions in different infrastructure and housing construction segments. It has a monopoly in aerospace construction, and is also the largest social-housing builder in China. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer (after deconsolidating COLI) include: - Revenue increases at around 10% annually in the next three years - Capex maintained at CNY11 billion annually in the next three years - Operating EBITDA margin maintained at 5%-5.5% in the next three years RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: - EBITDA margin sustained above 7% (after deconsolidating COLI) - Sustained net cash position (after deconsolidating COLI) Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - FFO-adjusted net leverage sustained above 3x (2015: 1.7x) (after deconsolidating COLI) - EBITDA margin sustained below 4% (after deconsolidating COLI) - Weakening linkages between CSCEC and the Chinese sovereign LIQUIDITY CSCECL had CNY321 billion of cash and equivalents and CNY570 billion of unused banking facilities at end-2016. Total debt was CNY368 billion, including CNY93 billion of short-term debt.

The government said in a statement Cuevas died on Monday in Mexico City, though the cause was not immediately clear. Cuevas' brooding figures graced exhibits from Paris to New York during a career as a painter, sculptor, writer, draftsman and engraver that spanned more than seven decades. Cultivating the image of a philandering  tomcat , Cuevas drew on the work of Francisco de Goya and Pablo Picasso, and his depictions of dark, deformed, animal-like figures were a sharp break with the socialist-tinged muralism long popular in Mexico. Tributes quickly followed news of his death.  Jose Luis Cuevas will always be remembered as a synonym of liberty, creation and universality,  Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Twitter. Once a leading light of a generation of artists in Mexico known as La Ruptura, or  The Breakaway , Cuevas had increasingly withdrawn from public life in recent years. Cuevas was born to a middle-class family in Mexico City on Feb. 26, 1934, on the upper floor of his grandfather's factory, a setting that he once mused had shaped his path in life. Turning to art from an early age, Cuevas attended Mexico's Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado arts school hosting his first exhibit at the age of 14 to a poor reception. Rheumatic fever kept him confined to bed for two years and he quit school. But he kept at his craft, and as an adolescent drew patients at a mental hospital where his brother worked. In 1959, he won first prize for drawing at the Sao Paulo Biennale, a regular art exhibition, launching him onto the global stage. Worldwide exhibitions and tours followed. Cuevas attacked leading 20th century muralists such as Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros, accusing them of being too close to the government and showing Mexican life from behind a  cactus curtain  as he called it. Often styling himself as a  gato macho , or tomcat, his provocative manner earned him lasting enmity from foes and once reportedly led to machine gun fire being directed at his home. One of his works, the  obscene figure  - a massive, metal statue of a crude humanoid creature on all fours with a leg cocked in the air like a dog marking its territory - caused such a stir in the city of Colima the local government relocated it. Cuevas' personal life was no less controversial. He married his first wife, Bertha Riestra in 1961, but the raffish, handsome Cuevas earned a reputation as a ladies' man, claiming to have had hundreds of sexual encounters. He reportedly had four women tattooed with his designs so that his works would grow old with the subjects. In 1981, Cuevas displayed his semen and an electrocardiogram taken while he was having sex as part of an exhibition called  Signs of Life . To accompany the exhibit, Cuevas issued a brochure in which he offered to impregnate any woman who wanted his child, he told Mexican newspaper Reforma in a 2000 interview. But the Mexican government made him withdraw the brochure on the grounds he was engaging in prostitution, he said.

The dairy, which has admitted facing  tremendous difficulties  getting a clear picture of its finances, said in a filing to the Hong Kong exchange it was ultimately looking for a  white knight  to financially support the firm. Huishan's woes came to light when its stock plunged 85 percent in March before being suspended. Since then most of its directors have quit, it has missed loan payments and lost contact with a key executive in charge of its finances and cash. As of March 31, Huishan owed $3.9 billion to creditors including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China Ltd and HSBC. It has hired debt restructuring advisers and forensic accountants to investigate gaps in its financial statements. The firm, billed as China's largest integrated dairy firm, said the restructuring plans would involve creating a new holding company that would include Huishan's businesses and assets and some separate firms controlled by Chairman Yang Kai. This would then be wholly owned by the listed unit, which would be controlled by the mix of creditors, current shareholders and management, with stakes yet to be negotiated. The plans - key to Huishan's survival - are the latest twist in a rapid fall from grace that has laid bare the risks of excess leverage and financial engineering in corporate China. Under the proposed plans, which would need the support of Huishan's creditors, the management team would continue to play a role  pending the eventual identification of a white knight to recapitalize the newly established group , the firm said.

The 17 men, who authorities said were armed with 24 guns, were killed by police near the coastal city of Mazatlan in the unruly state of Sinaloa on Friday night. Another two people died nearby in what appeared to be earlier, related shootings, the state attorney general's office said. None of the suspects in the gun battle were found wounded or arrested.     Genaro Robles, Sinaloa's head of police, put the outcome down to his officers' better training and said there was no use of excessive force or extrajudicial killing in the exchange. Five of the 11 police involved suffered gunshot wounds. None died. However, for relatives of the dead, the events raised the suspicion they were victims of a heavy-handed response by security forces of the kind that has stained Mexico's human rights record in recent years. Three people told Reuters they believed their relatives were killed in cold blood. Two of them cited gunshot wounds they said they had seen in the backs of their loved ones as evidence.  They murdered them,  said the sister of one of the dead men as she waited outside a funeral home in Mazatlan. She declined to give her name for fear of reprisals.  They didn't have a chance. This wasn't a gun battle like they say in the news.  Local municipal police also rejected the allegation, though human rights officials are investigating possible abuses. Drug smugglers have been scrapping for control of the state amid a power vacuum following the deportation of iconic Sinaloa-native, drug boss Joaquin  El Chapo  Guzman. Police chief Robles said officers were alerted to two people injured behind a mall in the small town of Villa Union on Friday evening, and chased down the suspected assailants, sparking a gun battle on a road outside town. Blood was visible on the road when Reuters visited the scene at the weekend. Nightime footage posted on social media afterwards purporting to show victims of the event, showed bodies piled up in the back of pickup trucks, with more scattered along a road. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the videos. The nephew of one of the victims said his uncle had worked for a drug cartel and had been shot from behind.  When I saw my uncle's body it had gunshots in the back,  said the man, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. One local policeman described the shootings as  butchery  and unlike another recent gun-battle he had seen. He asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. State Probe Miriam Hernandez of the Sinaloa state Commission for Human Rights said the organization had opened an investigation into whether the killings involved human rights abuses. Joel Ernesto Soto, head of the municipal police in Mazatlan, whose men fought in the gun battle, said he welcomed the probe.  They can come and ask and speak to us. We'll be here waiting,  he said, referring to the commission.  This event was completely fortuitous; there was nothing untoward.  In 2015, police executed nearly two dozen suspected gang members in an ambush near the western town of Tanhuato, the national human rights commission found. It was one of the worst abuses by security forces in a decade of drug violence. That followed another notorious incident in 2014 when 22 suspected cartel henchmen were killed by soldiers in Tlatlaya, a town a couple of hours southwest of Mexico City. Many of the soldiers were later acquitted of murder. Police killed 17 people for every officer lost in gun battles in 2014, a study by Mexico's National Autonomous University found. Experts said that ratio was consistent with excessive use of force. Violence has risen sharply in Sinaloa since kingpin Guzman was sent to the United States in January, as splits within his once-dominant Sinaloa Cartel and attacks from rival gangs fed a killing spree. There were 619 murders in Sinaloa in the first five months of 2017, up more than 75 percent from the same period in 2016.  Everything is disintegrating,  policeman Soto said. The family members gathered outside the Mazatlan funeral home said the rising violence was making police more corrupt.  These killings were dirty,  said the mother of one of the victims, who also declined to give her name.  This wasn't a fight. It was something else, but what can you do?

Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has claimed that its partner has breached joint venture contracts as it pursues an $18 billion sale of the unit and is seeking an injunction to prevent any deal without its consent.[nL3N1JC082] In its filing with the Superior Court of California, Toshiba argued that their joint venture interests only cover a small portion of its flash memory semiconductor business and that the court has no jurisdiction as its primary place of business was Japan. Toshiba is scrambling to get a deal done as fast as possible as it needs funds to cover billions in cost overruns at now-bankrupt unit Westinghouse. It is currently negotiating with a preferred bidder consortium that includes Japan government investors and U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital.  Even if an agreement is reached with a bidder...if Toshiba is prevented from moving forward on implementing that transaction, the harm to an overall deal would be severe - and may well make the implementation of a transaction impossible,  said in its filing, which was made on Friday. Western Digital has tabled its own bid for the chip unit - the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips - but the offer has gained little traction with Toshiba, which says it raises anti-trust concerns. The Japanese firm is also reluctant to engage with Western Digital as its U.S. partner has said in the past it wants to take control of the unit. Western Digital argues that an injunction will ensure that an international arbitration court will be given an appropriate opportunity to resolve their dispute. The court hearing on the issue is scheduled for July 14 and Western Digital has said it believes a decision could come on the same day. Western Digital is expected to file a response to Toshiba's opposition before the hearing.

North Korea launched the ballistic missile from its western region into the sea off its east coast, South Korea's military said, ahead of a summit of leaders from the Group of 20 countries in Germany later this week. The missile flew for about 40 minutes and may have landed in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the Japanese government said, adding that it had strongly protested what was a clear violation of UN resolutions. The Nikkei was up 0.3 percent at 20,120.98 by midmorning, trimming gains from an intraday high of 20,197.16.  North Korea's missile launch gave investors a reason to stay on the sidelines,  said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. The weak yen, which can boost export earnings, would offer support through the day but gains are likely to be limited, he said. Traders expected trading volumes to be subdued by the closure of U.S. markets on Tuesday for the Independence Day holiday. The dollar held steady at 113.360 yen after reaching as high as 113.480 late on Monday, its strongest since mid-May. That rise came after a stronger-than-expected national factory activity index from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management (ISM). Automakers were leading the gains, with the transport equipment sector rising 2.2 percent to be the best performer on the board. Toyota Motor Corp increased 2.3 percent, Honda Motor Co rose 2.8 percent and Nissan Motor Co pushed up by 1.9 percent. Financial companies, which include banks and insurers that invest in higher-yielding products such as foreign bonds, were also in demand after U.S. Treasury yields rose overnight.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics' data on Tuesday showed retail sales rose 0.6 in May, beating expectations for a meagre 0.2 percent increase. It also follows a solid 1.0 percent jump in April, marking the best two months of sales since end-2013. The data will comfort the country's central bank which had feared ballooning debt in the red-hot property sector was pinching consumers' ability to spend elsewhere in the economy. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) holds its July policy meeting later in the day and is expected to keep the benchmark cash rate at an all time low of 1.5 percent, where it has been since August last year.  Two firmer months together do suggest the consumer was doing more of the heavy lifting when it comes to economic growth in the second quarter,  said Michael Blythe, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank. But  the fundamentals are still poor -- people are worried about losing their jobs or ever getting a wage rise. So it's hard to say this is a definitive turning point.  However, economists say the RBA will stick to its neutral stance as household debt to disposable income was at a record high 190 percent, which is high by any standard. And while the labour market was showing some signs of improvement, wages growth remains stuck at its slowest pace ever. All eyes will be on the post-meeting statement for any hint of hawkishness given central banks in Europe and Canada had surprised recently by talking of the need for tighter policies.  The market is on the hunt for a hawkish signal,  said Daniel Been, head of forex research at ANZ.  We do not think that the RBA will satiate them. The economy is still running at levels just above stall speed... We think the RBA is comfortably on hold and will not want to send a signal to the contrary. AUD bulls beware.  Thursday's data shows a solid 2.2 percent gain in household goods retailing, 1.3 percent rise in footwear and personal accessory retailing while cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services were up 0.6 percent. An index of online retail sales rebounded in May to be up 1.3 percent following a contraction the month before. Annual growth stood at 7.9 percent in May, more than twice the 3.8 percent for traditional retailers. Australians also splashed out on big ticket items such as cars - sales of new vehicles rose by the most in 11 months in May to an all-time peak, led by insatiable demand for sports utilities. Strong sales of transport vehicles also hinted at a much-needed pick up in business investment.

The U.S. Supreme Court in a ruling last Monday revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order that banned people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, which had been blocked by lower courts. The highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope, saying that it cannot apply to anyone with credible  bona fide relationship  with a U.S. person or entity. Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent terrorist attacks. But opponents, including states and refugee advocacy groups, sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminates against Muslims. After the Supreme Court ruling, the government said that a  bona fide relationship  means close family members only: parents, spouses, siblings and children. Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins from the six countries would still be banned.  The government's definition,  hews closely to the categorical determinations articulated by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act,  Department of Justice lawyers argued in court papers on Monday.   The government's filing came after the State of Hawaii last week went to U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu, who originally ruled to block the ban, to seek clarification of the Supreme Court's ruling, arguing the government's definition of  bona fide relationship  was too narrow. The government said Hawaii, and refugee organizations that filed a  friend of the court  brief in support of the state, were seeking to apply  broader, free-hand rules.  The refugee organizations had argued that their work to resettle refugees, a process that can take years of work in coordination with the U.S. government, qualifies as a  bona fide  relationship with a U.S. entity. Any refugees with such a relationship should be exempt from the three-month ban on refugees included in the executive order, according to the Supreme Court ruling.  But the government said workers with offers of employment with a U.S. company and international students are fundamentally different than refugees receiving help from U.S. resettlement agencies.  A refugee's relationship with the agency flows from the government, not from an independent relationship between the refugee and the resettlement agency,  the government said in its brief.  Indeed, resettlement agencies typically do not have any direct contact with the refugees they assure before their arrival in the United States.   Using the organization's interpretation would make the refugee provisions in the executive order  largely meaningless,  the government said.  U.S. refugee resettlement is continuing as normal until July 6, the State Department has said, around when the 50,000 cap for the fiscal year set by Trump's executive order is likely to be reached.  Late on Thursday, before the ban went into effect, the government reversed its position on fiancés, saying they could also qualify for exceptions. The court filing described a 72-hour scramble to  coordinate among multiple government agencies, and issue detailed guidance  on how to implement the Supreme Court's ruling.  The roll out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued on Friday compared to in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order, sparking protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.

All the sectors on the benchmark were in the black, with advancing issues outnumbering declining ones by a 9.4-to-1 ratio. The S&P; 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Monday as energy and bank stocks climbed. In Australia, financials drove the gains on the benchmark, with Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Australia New Zealand Banking Group all up more than 1.9 percent.  We have got a strong lead from Wall Street and the financials performed very strongly in the overnight session so that has translated into a good response from Aussie financials,  said Ben Le Brun, a market analyst at OptionsXpress, an electronic trading platform provider. Aussie lenders were also buoyed by news that opposition lawmakers in the state of South Australia vowed to block a state-based bank tax, a win for the lenders left reeling when the government unexpectedly unveiled a levy in its annual budget to raise revenues. Meanwhile, energy stocks saw strong support after oil rose more than 2 percent on Monday, resuming its longest stretch of daily gains in more than five years after data pointed to a reduction in U.S. output. Among the energy stocks, Beach Energy advanced 2.5 percent, while Caltex Australia Ltd was up 2.1 percent. In other commodities, Chinese steel futures climbed more than 3 percent on Monday to their highest since March, supported by a strong demand in the world's top producer and data showing a recovery in China's manufacturing activity.

It has been a dismal period for Djokovic who has also relinquished his number one ranking and failed to get past the third round in two of his last four grand slam appearances.  He has at least tasted some rare recent success, having broken with tradition to play a pre-Wimbledon warm-up at Eastbourne, where he won his first title since January by beating Gael Monfils last week. That allowed him to not only tune up his grasscourt game but also lift his spirits after a testing few months.   Just overall very happy with the way it went, and where my form is at,  he told reporters after Saturday's final.  Seven times winner Roger Federer will also entertain fans on Centre Court on Tuesday and should be in good shape when he faces Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov, having skipped the entire claycourt season to prepare for Wimbledon.  In the women's draw, Germany's world number one Angelique Kerber is in action against Irina Falconi of the United States and third seed Karolina Pliskova, who won the women's tournament at Eastbourne, plays Russian Evgeniya Rodina.

The ninth seed did not disappoint the legion of Japanese fans who gave him a hero's welcome as he walked on to Court 12, demolishing an opponent who was playing his first senior-level match on grass. He said afterwards that he was confident he could eclipse his best performance at Wimbledon - the last 16 in 2014 and 2016 - and that he aimed to  win the whole thing .  That's my goal,  he said.  I hope I can make it.   Japan's highest-ever ranked player did not show any sign of the injuries that have forced him out of the last five grasscourt tournaments he has contested, going back to 2015, including at Halle in Germany last month.  Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 3, 2017   Japan’s Kei Nishikori in action during his first round match against Italy’s Marco CecchinatoTony O'BrienThe 27-year-old said he could not pin down the reason for his run of injuries on grass - variously affecting his calf, hip and ribs - but added that he struggled with the summer switch from clay courts.   Now I'm feeling very good, feeling 100 percent again,  he said.  I hope I can stay healthy these two weeks.  Nishikori outclassed his opponent from the first point when he powered a backhand winner down the line.  Cecchinato, ranked 102nd, could not handle Nishikori's thundering drives off both wings, with the 24-year-old Italian's one-handed backhand proving particularly fragile. Nishikori showed off his full repertoire of shots in a faultless third set which he peppered with delicate drop shots and ended with an emphatic volley. His toughest challenge of the day was making his way off the court as he was mobbed by dozens of fans seeking autographs.

The dairy, which has admitted facing  tremendous difficulties  getting a clear picture of its finances, said in a filing to the Hong Kong exchange it was ultimately looking for a  white knight  to financially support the firm. Huishan's woes came to light when its stock plunged 85 percent in March before being suspended. Since then most of its directors have quit, it has missed loan payments and lost contact with a key executive in charge of its finances and cash. As of March 31, Huishan owed $3.9 billion to creditors including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China Ltd and HSBC. It has hired debt restructuring advisers and forensic accountants to investigate gaps in its financial statements. The firm, billed as China's largest integrated dairy firm, said the restructuring plans would involve creating a new holding company that would include Huishan's businesses and assets and some separate firms controlled by Chairman Yang Kai. This would then be wholly owned by the listed unit, which would be controlled by the mix of creditors, current shareholders and management, with stakes yet to be negotiated. The plans - key to Huishan's survival - are the latest twist in a rapid fall from grace that has laid bare the risks of excess leverage and financial engineering in corporate China. Under the proposed plans, which would need the support of Huishan's creditors, the management team would continue to play a role  pending the eventual identification of a white knight to recapitalise the newly established group , the firm said.

The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was a shade lower at 96.125 after rising 0.6 percent overnight as a stronger-than-expected rise in the June Institute of Supply Management (ISM) national factory activity index propelled the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest since May 16. Monday's developments helped the dollar index bounce back from a nine-month low of 95.470 plumbed on Friday. The greenback was hit hard last week as expectations increased that central banks in Europe and Canada would eventually shift to tighter monetary policy.  The dollar's latest rise is driven by direct demand, as opposed to the U.S. currency gaining thanks to the weakness of its peers,  said Shin Kadota, a senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.  Expectations towards the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates later this year had perhaps sunk too low. We are now seeing such lowered expectations being reversed a little.  The euro was effectively flat at $1.1369 after dropping 0.6 percent overnight. The common currency has taken a step back from a near 14-month high of $1.1445 scaled on Friday. The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 113.270 yen after going as high as 113.480 late on Monday, its loftiest since mid-May. Pressure against the yen has been mounting as the Bank of Japan is expected to stick with its negative interest rate scheme in order to meet its inflation target while its counterparts seem poised to hike rates or begin exiting their accommodative policies.  The yen is slipping against popular crosses like euro/yen, pound/yen and Aussie/yen, which is contributing to its weakness against the dollar,  said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo.  And Japanese stocks are managing to hold up, and its easy for dollar/yen to rise in tandem.  The euro edged up to a 16-month high of 128.970 yen , sterling was at a seven-week peak of 146.84 yen and the Aussie touched 86.96 yen, its strongest since March 21. The dollar dipped to 113.125 yen on news that North Korea launched a missile on Tuesday, which Tokyo said appeared to have landed in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). But it quickly trimmed most of its losses with the region's financial markets having become accustomed to Pyongyang's missile launches. The immediate focus for markets was on the RBA's policy decision due later in the day. While the RBA is not expected to hike interest rates this time, some market participants are looking for any signs of the central bank joining a shift towards a hawkish stance by peers like the European Central Bank, Bank of England and the Bank of Canada. Others cautioned against expecting too much from the Australian central bank at this juncture.  To be hawkish now would be an unnecessary squeeze on the currency and the consumer at a time that neither is required,  wrote Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at ThinkMarkets in Melbourne. The Australian dollar was 0.1 percent higher at $0.7668 . The Aussie had surged to a three-month high of $0.7712 on Friday thanks to a bounce by commodity prices and last week's broad retreat in the greenback.

The U.S. Supreme Court in a ruling last Monday revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order that banned people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, which had been blocked by lower courts. The highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope, saying that it cannot apply to anyone with credible  bona fide relationship  with a U.S. person or entity. Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent terrorist attacks. But opponents, including states and refugee advocacy groups, sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminates against Muslims. After the Supreme Court ruling, the government said that a  bona fide relationship  means close family members only: parents, spouses, siblings and children. Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins from the six countries would still be banned.  The government's definition,  hews closely to the categorical determinations articulated by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act,  Department of Justice lawyers argued in court papers on Monday.   The government's filing came after the State of Hawaii last week went to U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu, who originally ruled to block the ban, to seek clarification of the Supreme Court's ruling, arguing the government's definition of  bona fide relationship  was too narrow. The government said Hawaii, and refugee organizations that filed a  friend of the court  brief in support of the state, were seeking to apply  broader, free-hand rules.  The refugee organizations had argued that their work to resettle refugees, a process that can take years of work in coordination with the U.S. government, qualifies as a  bona fide  relationship with a U.S. entity. Any refugees with such a relationship should be exempt from the three-month ban on refugees included in the executive order, according to the Supreme Court ruling.  But the government said workers with offers of employment with a U.S. company and international students are fundamentally different than refugees receiving help from U.S. resettlement agencies.  A refugee's relationship with the agency flows from the government, not from an independent relationship between the refugee and the resettlement agency,  the government said in its brief.  Indeed, resettlement agencies typically do not have any direct contact with the refugees they assure before their arrival in the United States.   Using the organization's interpretation would make the refugee provisions in the executive order  largely meaningless,  the government said.  U.S. refugee resettlement is continuing as normal until July 6, the State Department has said, around when the 50,000 cap for the fiscal year set by Trump's executive order is likely to be reached.  Late on Thursday, before the ban went into effect, the government reversed its position on fiancés, saying they could also qualify for exceptions. The court filing described a 72-hour scramble to  coordinate among multiple government agencies, and issue detailed guidance  on how to implement the Supreme Court's ruling.  The roll out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued on Friday compared to in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order, sparking protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.

Foreign credit rating agencies must now be registered under the PBOC, have a certain level of experience, have sound corporate governance and be generally accepted by qualified institutional investors, according to the notice, which was published on the central bank's website on Monday evening. To qualify, the foreign credit ratings agency must not have been involved in any  major illegal acts in the past three years and not be subject to any investigations for illegal activity, the notice added. In December last year, the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission - the government's top planning agency - jointly published draft foreign investment guidelines aimed at removing restrictions on credit investigation and ratings services.

Brent crude futures were at $49.43 per barrel at 0147 GMT, down 25 cents, or 0.5 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading down 22 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $46.85 a barrel. The falls came after both benchmarks recovered around 12 percent from their recent lows on June 21. Many traders closed positions ahead of the U.S. Independence Day holiday on July 4, while Brent also faced technical resistance as it approached $50 per barrel, traders said. Despite this, market sentiment has shifted somewhat. Late May and most of June were overwhelmingly bearish as U.S. output rose and doubts grew over the ablility of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to hold back enough production to tighten the market. But sentiment began to shift towards the end of June, when U.S. data showed a dip in American oil output and a slight fall in drilling for new production. RIG-OL-USA-BHI C-OUT-T-EIA ANZ bank said on Tuesday that the dips in U.S. production and drilling were  a small but significant shift in the dynamics in the oil market  and that this would take some pressure off OPEC's struggling efforts to rein in oversupply. OPEC is leading a bid to tighten oil markets by pledging to hold back around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in output between January this year and March 2018. Its efforts have been undermined by rising output from Libya and Nigeria, who are exempt from the cuts, which helped push the group's June output to a 2017 high of 32.57 million bpd, about 820,000 bpd above its supply target.

Pluralism has always been a part of Indonesia's DNA,  Joko Widodo told Reuters in an interview at the presidential palace in Jakarta.  Despite many challenges, Islam in Indonesia has always been a force for moderation.  Indonesia's state ideology includes national unity, social justice and democracy alongside belief in God, and enshrines religious diversity in a secular system of government. Hardline Islamist groups were banned under the authoritarian regime of President Suharto, which ended in 1998, but they have gained ground in recent years, emerging from the fringes of society in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country. Religious and political tensions spiralled at the end of last year when Islamists led protests by hundreds of thousands in Jakarta against the capital's then governor, an ethnic-Chinese Christian who was charged with insulting the Koran. Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ally of President Widodo, lost his bid for re-election to a Muslim rival in April after months of agitation against him by a radical group, the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI). In May he was sentenced to two years in jail for blasphemy. Widodo said Indonesia was  still a model  of pluralism and noted comments on Saturday by former U.S. President Barack Obama - on a personal visit to the country where he spent some of his childhood - that its history of tolerance must be preserved.  It is very important here in Indonesia, the United States, Europe, everywhere, to fight against the politics of 'us and them',  Obama told a conference in Jakarta. Careful Line on Homosexuality The targets of hardline Islamic groups have included the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, many of whom have been driven underground by police raids. With the exception of the ultra-conservative Aceh province, where Islamic law is enforced and two men were publicly flogged in May for gay sex, homosexuality is legal in Indonesia. But Widodo's own defence minister has branded homosexuality a national security threat and last week a leader of Indonesia's second-largest Muslim group called for a boycott of Starbucks because of the international coffee chain's pro-gay stand. The president trod a careful line on the question of LGBT rights, saying that  Indonesia remains a tolerant nation  whose constitution guarantees that everyone's rights are respected and protected. But he added:  We are the largest majority Muslim country so Indonesia has its own religious norms, unique values and also cultures that must be respected.  Isis Has No Place in Indonesia The muscle-flexing of hardline groups has fed fears that Indonesia will become fertile ground for Islamist militants. Widodo said he would press parliament to move more quickly on passing a new anti-terrorism law that would make it easier to both arrest and detain suspects.  We need this law,  he said, hammering his finger on the table in front of him. The attempt in May by a small army of Islamic State-allied fighters to overrun a city in the southern Philippines has been widely seen as a bid by the ultra-radical group, on a backfoot in Syria and Iraq, to establish a stronghold in Southeast Asia. Philippines officials have said there were Indonesians and Malaysians among the fighters who attacked Marawi City, where a battle with government troops has ground on for six weeks.  ISIS has no place in Indonesia,  Widodo said, using a popular acronym for Islamic State. He noted that Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines had agreed to joint maritime patrols to prevent militants moving across their islands, and said he discussed cooperation on a phone call with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte last week.  Our security and intelligence agencies continue to work hard to combat this threat. We are also continuing to promote the values of moderate Islam and when I talked with President Duterte last week I said that 'your problem is my problem'.

IHS Markit's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone rose to 57.4 in June, up from May's 57.0 and pipping the preliminary reading of 57.3. June's reading was the highest since April 2011 and was comfortably above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday, jumped to 58.7 from 58.3 - a level not seen in over six years.  Euro zone manufacturing growth gained further momentum in June, rounding off the best quarter for just over six years,  said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. FILE PHOTO: Finished cars are stored at the SEAT factory in Martorell, near Barcelona, Spain March 24, 2017.Albert Gea/File PhotoSuggesting the momentum will continue into the second half, new orders rose at the fastest rate since early 2011, backlogs of work increased at the fastest pace in over 13 years, raw materials were depleted and factories increased headcount at a near record pace. That meant manufacturers were at their most optimistic for at least five years. The future output index, which gauges expectations, soared to 67.4 from 66.0 - the highest level in the sub-index's history.  There's no sign of the impressive performance ending any time soon. The manufacturing sector is clearly in expansion mode and looks poised for continued robust growth in coming months,  Williamson said. The upturn came alongside factories increasing prices, as they have done for nine months, welcome news to policymakers at the European Central Bank who have been battling for years to get inflation to their 2 percent target ceiling.  Inflation was a stronger-than-expected 1.3 percent in June, official flash data showed on Friday, and while still below target the strong economic data of late meant ECB chief Mario Draghi last week raised the prospect of policy-tightening.

The opposition, starting a fourth month of street protests against the socialist government it decries as a dictatorship, will organize the symbolic vote for July 16 as part of its strategy to delegitimize the unpopular Maduro.  Venezuelans will also be asked their view on the military's responsibility for  recovering constitutional order  and the formation of a new  national unity  government, the Democratic Unity coalition announced.   Let the people decide!  said Julio Borges, the president of the opposition-led National Assembly, confirming what two senior opposition sources told Reuters earlier on Monday. The opposition's planned vote, likely to be dismissed by the government, would be two weeks ahead of a planned July 30 vote proposed by Maduro for a Constituent Assembly with powers to reform the constitution and supersede other institutions.  The government is trying to formalize dictatorship,  said opposition leader Henrique Capriles, warning the South American OPEC nation was approaching  zero hour . According to a recent survey by pollster Datanalisis, seven  in 10 Venezuelans are opposed to rewriting the constitution, which was reformed by late leader Hugo Chavez in 1999. Maduro, 54, Chavez's unpopular successor, says the assembly is the only way to bring peace to Venezuela after the deaths of at least 84 people in and around anti-government unrest since the start of April.  The people have a right to vote and the people will vote on July 30, rain or shine!  Maduro said to cheers during a speech at an open-air event on Monday with candidates to the new assembly, during which he also prayed and danced.  Opponents say Maduro's plan is a ruse to consolidate the ruling Socialist Party's grip on power and avoid a conventional free election that opinion polls show he would lose.  Venezuelan opposition leader and Governor of Miranda state Henrique Capriles attends a meeting of the Venezuelan coalition of opposition parties (MUD) in Caracas, Venezuela July 3, 2017.Carlos Garcia RawlinsCritics also accuse the government of threatening people with layoffs or loss of state-provided homes if they do not vote. Maduro on Monday urged state workers to participate, saying for instance that every single employee of state oil company PDVSA should cast a ballot.  'Darkness' Not Forever The next presidential vote is due by the end of 2018, but protesters have been demanding it be brought forward, even as Maduro's opponents worry about how free and fair such a vote would be. Slideshow (15 Images)The two highest-profile potential opposition candidates for a presidential election are Capriles, who has been barred from holding office, and Leopoldo Lopez, who is in jail.    Opposition protesters also want solutions to a crushing  economic crisis, freedom for hundreds of jailed activists, and independence for the National Assembly.   Maduro, a former foreign minister who was narrowly elected in 2013 after Chavez's death from cancer, says protesting opponents are seeking a coup with U.S. support. His allies say that a new Constituent Assembly would annul the existing legislature and would also remove chief state prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who has split with the socialists during the crisis and become a thorn in their side. Officials have turned on Ortega and are petitioning the Supreme Court to remove her. On Monday, the comptroller's office announced a national audit of state prosecutors' offices. Ortega's office described it as  revenge for the current institutional crisis  and accused comptroller officials of  abuses  in trying to enter buildings without prior notice.  The darkness does not last forever nor does it extend in its totality,  Ortega said in an address to the National Assembly.  We must make big efforts to reactivate the institutional and electoral paths.

Under the leadership of our new CEO, Vale is reviewing all assets and operations, with low-performing assets an area of particular focus. Vale New Caledonia is part of that review,  spokesman Cory McPhee told Reuters by email.  The nickel price today is languishing at around $9,000 a tonne with no indication of recovery in the near-term. This has forced us to reassess all areas of the nickel business, including our operations in New Caledonia, which continue to lose money at these prices.  Schvartsman has set up working groups to assess each of the business units at Vale, the world's biggest iron ore miner, and a report is expected within two months, according to analysts. Global nickel miners are coming under renewed pressure to cut costs or close capacity as a flood of cheap ore enters the  market, and Vale has already said it plans to suspend two of its older high-cost Canadian mines this year. Indonesia and the Philippines are ramping up shipments after Indonesia relaxed an ore export ban earlier this year and a hardline Filipino environmentalist was ousted from the country's mining ministry.

McClure’s resignation came after entrepreneur Sarah Kunst accused the investor of sexual harassment in a New York Times story published on Friday. 500 Startups initially responded by saying it had previously demoted McClure after an investigation. “In best interest of @500Startups & at request co-founder @christine_tsai, I am resigning effective immediately,” McClure wrote on Twitter. The firm confirmed the resignation. Also on Monday, Elizabeth Yin, who has been a partner with 500 Startups since October 2014, said in a note to colleagues that she had resigned from the firm on Saturday after members of the management team continued to deny misconduct on McClure’s behalf. The turmoil at 500 Startups comes in the wake of a series of revelations about sexual harassment and discrimination against women and minorities in the tech industry. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was forced to resign after an investigation prompted by the blog post of a female engineer, Susan Fowler, found a culture of sexism at the company. More than 20 Uber employees were also fired.  The venture firm Binary Capital faces an uncertain future after allegations of serial sexual harassment by partner Justin Caldbeck forced his resignation and that of his partner.  McClure's resignation from 500 Startups came just hours before a second entrepreneur affiliated with 500 Startups published a detailed account of her experiences with McClure. Cheryl Sew Hoy, who sold a startup to Walmart Labs and was the founding CEO of the Malaysian Global Innovation and Creativity Center, accused McClure of propositioning her several times and then pushing himself on her and kissing her without consent in 2014.   It's not just inappropriate, it's assault,  Sew Hoy wrote on her website.  McClure did not respond to a request for comment on Sew Hoy's allegations. 500 Startups said in a statement: “We appreciate Cheryl speaking up and realize how upsetting and painful it is for her to have gone through that experience and have the courage to speak up. We can only hope our efforts in changing 500 can help create a safe and effective platform for female founders around the world.     In a blog published Friday, 500 Startups Chief Executive Christine Tsai said that a decision to change the firm’s leadership had occurred “months ago” and that McClure’s role had “been limited.” Yin, in her note, disputed Tsai's account. “It’s become clear to me over the last month that I can no longer be part of this organization,” Yin said in the note, which was obtained by Reuters. “The actions that 500 has undertaken have deviated from its mission, and I can no longer continue to represent this organization.” Yin confirmed the note in an email but offered no further comment. In response to Yin's note, 500 Startups said that in April management had  learned of allegations related to inappropriate behavior by  McClure. The firm investigated the incident and notified staff at an all-hands meeting that McClure would step down.   Due to the sensitivity of personnel issues and the privacy of all involved, the investigation was kept confidential,  the company statement said.

The consumer price index rose 1.9 percent in June from a year earlier, data showed on Tuesday, down from the 2 percent increase in May, and lagging the 2.0 percent forecast in a Reuters poll. The index declined 0.1 percent a month earlier, after edging up 0.1 percent in May. Asia's fourth largest economy grew at its quickest pace in  six quarters in January-March period, thanks to robust construction sector activity and exports. Moderate price pressure near the Bank of Korea's target of 2 percent since early this year suggested private consumption is steadily improving.  Agricultural product prices have been volatile, but gains in service costs have been sustaining the overall price pressure,  Park Jung-woo, an economist at Korea Investment and Securities said. Tuesday's data showed the costs for electricity, gas and tap water declined 1.6 percent on-year. That was partly offset by inflation from fresh food products, which stood at 10.5 percent in June, reflecting rapidly rising egg prices sparked by an outbreak of avian influenza.

McClure’s resignation came after entrepreneur Sarah Kunst accused the investor of sexual harassment in a New York Times story published on Friday. 500 Startups initially responded by saying it had previously demoted McClure after an investigation. “In best interest of @500Startups & at request co-founder @christine_tsai, I am resigning effective immediately,” McClure wrote on Twitter. The firm confirmed the resignation. Also on Monday, Elizabeth Yin, who has been a partner with 500 Startups since October 2014, said in a note to colleagues that she had resigned from the firm on Saturday after members of the management team continued to deny misconduct on McClure’s behalf. The turmoil at 500 Startups comes in the wake of a series of revelations about sexual harassment and discrimination against women and minorities in the tech industry. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was forced to resign after an investigation prompted by the blog post of a female engineer, Susan Fowler, found a culture of sexism at the company. More than 20 Uber employees were also fired.  The venture firm Binary Capital faces an uncertain future after allegations of serial sexual harassment by partner Justin Caldbeck forced his resignation and that of his partner.  McClure's resignation from 500 Startups came just hours before a second entrepreneur affiliated with 500 Startups published a detailed account of her experiences with McClure. Cheryl Sew Hoy, who sold a startup to Walmart Labs and was the founding CEO of the Malaysian Global Innovation and Creativity Center, accused McClure of propositioning her several times and then pushing himself on her and kissing her without consent in 2014.   It's not just inappropriate, it's assault,  Sew Hoy wrote on her website.  McClure did not respond to a request for comment on Sew Hoy's allegations. 500 Startups said in a statement: “We appreciate Cheryl speaking up and realize how upsetting and painful it is for her to have gone through that experience and have the courage to speak up. We can only hope our efforts in changing 500 can help create a safe and effective platform for female founders around the world.     In a blog published Friday, 500 Startups Chief Executive Christine Tsai said that a decision to change the firm’s leadership had occurred “months ago” and that McClure’s role had “been limited.” Yin, in her note, disputed Tsai's account. “It’s become clear to me over the last month that I can no longer be part of this organization,” Yin said in the note, which was obtained by Reuters. “The actions that 500 has undertaken have deviated from its mission, and I can no longer continue to represent this organization.” Yin confirmed the note in an email but offered no further comment. In response to Yin's note, 500 Startups said that in April management had  learned of allegations related to inappropriate behavior by  McClure. The firm investigated the incident and notified staff at an all-hands meeting that McClure would step down.   Due to the sensitivity of personnel issues and the privacy of all involved, the investigation was kept confidential,  the company statement said.

Companies surveyed by the Bank of Japan expect consumer prices to rise 0.8 percent a year from now, higher than their projection for a 0.7 percent increase three months ago. Companies also expect consumer prices to rise an annual 1.1 percent three years from now, up from a 1.0 percent annual increase seen in the previous BOJ survey. The data come one day after the BOJ's tankan survey on corporate sentiment showed big manufactures are the most confident in three years, offering some hope that prices will rise, albeit at a gradual pace.  Labor shortages will push up inflation expectations over time,  said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  However, this is a slow process, so the BOJ's monetary policy will be on hold for the time being.  Core consumer prices, which include oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.4 percent in May from a year earlier, marking the fifth straight month of gains and accelerating from a 0.3 percent increase in April, data last week showed. However, consumer prices were unchanged in May after stripping out the effect of energy costs, underscoring the BOJ's struggles to push inflation to its 2 percent target. The BOJ is likely to cut its consumer price forecast for the current fiscal year at a quarter review of its projections in July, people familiar with its thinking told Reuters. However, a slight uptick in inflation expectations, combined with increased optimism in the corporate sector, could give the BOJ reason to keep its longer-term price forecasts unchanged, The BOJ started the survey on corporate price expectations from the tankan in March 2014 to gather more information on inflation expectations, key to its current stimulus program.

Trump is preparing for the two-day Group of 20 meeting that starts in Hamburg, Germany, on Friday, just over a month after a G7 summit in Sicily showed deep divisions between Trump and other Western leaders on such issues.  A fractious first NATO summit with Trump also left European allies wondering where the military alliance goes next. Trump will hold separate meetings with various leaders in Hamburg, including host German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and a potentially difficult first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A White House official said on Monday night that Trump held an  extensive discussion  by telephone with Merkel, focusing on issues including trade and climate change. A little over one month ago, Trump said the United States was withdrawing from an international agreement aimed at reducing global carbon emissions that are blamed for climate change. The Trump administration is also pressuring G20 nations to take steps to reduce global steel oversupply and other distortions in that market. The White House said that in a separate conversation with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Trump  underscored his appreciation for Italy’s efforts to address the significant Libyan migration crisis.  FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump arrives at the Celebrate Freedom Rally in Washington, U.S. July 1, 2017.Yuri Gripas/File PhotoIn remarks last week, Merkel raised the prospect of an open clash with Trump at the Hamburg summit, although some Trump administration officials have played down the discord. Heather Conley, a State Department official during Republican President George W. Bush's administration, said the United States' European allies were still shocked after the G7 and NATO summits with Trump cast doubt over Washington's relation with its allies. “There’s concern he could improve it – but could also do further damage,” said Conley, who is now with the CSIS think tank in Washington.  U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at the Celebrate Freedom Rally in Washington, U.S. July 1, 2017.Yuri GripasTrump-Putin Meeting Russia and the United States are still discussing the timing of the encounter between Trump and Putin, a Kremlin aide said on Monday. Since Trump was elected last November, Russia has been keenly anticipating the Republican president's first meeting with Putin, hoping it would trigger a reset in U.S.-Russia relations that plunged to post-Cold War lows under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. But with Trump embroiled in controversy at home over his associates' potential links to Moscow, the session with Putin has become a minefield. Too warm a meeting would allow Trump's domestic opponents to accuse him of being a Kremlin stooge. U.S. diplomat Thomas Shannon met on Monday with Russia's ambassador to Washington, Sergei Kislyak, to prepare for the Trump-Putin meeting, the State Department said.  They also discussed scheduling a new meeting between Shannon and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, which Moscow canceled in June in anger at expanded U.S. sanctions on Russia.

The dollar's latest rise is driven by direct demand, as opposed to the U.S. currency gaining thanks to the weakness of its peers,  said Shin Kadota, a senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.  Expectations towards the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates later this year had perhaps sunk too low. We are now seeing such lowered expectations being reversed a little.  The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.1373 after dropping 0.6 percent overnight. The common currency has taken a step back from a near 14-month high of $1.1445 scaled on Friday. The dollar was steady at 113.360 yen after going as high as 113.480 late on Monday, its strongest since mid-May. The immediate focus for markets was on the RBA's policy decision due later in the day. While the RBA is not expected to hike interest rates this time, market participants are looking for any signs of the central bank joining a shift towards a hawkish stance by peers like the European Central Bank, Bank of England and the Bank of Canada. The Australian dollar was 0.1 percent higher at $0.7666 . The Aussie had surged to a three-month high of $0.7712 on Friday thanks to a bounce by commodity prices and last week's broad retreat in the greenback.

John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2tIamvF * Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2sEiw3l * Chart 3: tmsnrt.rs/2sEoUHL * Chart 4: tmsnrt.rs/2uhe8Ju * Chart 5: tmsnrt.rs/2t8NQuy By John Kemp LONDON, July 3 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers had amassed a record number of short positions in petroleum futures and options by the start of last week, which primed the oil market for a sharp short-covering rally at the end of the month. Hedge funds and other money managers held short positions in the five major contracts on crude, gasoline and heating oil amounting to 510 million barrels on June 27, according to regulatory and exchange data. Fund managers have added 200 million barrels of extra short positions since the end of May and 377 million barrels since crude prices peaked in the middle of February (tmsnrt.rs/2tIamvF). Hedge funds were even more pessimistic than in January 2016, with more short positions than when oil prices were touching their cyclical lows below $30 per barrel. Overall, fund managers were running net short positions of 20 million barrels in gasoline and 32 million barrels in heating oil on June 27 (tmsnrt.rs/2sEiw3l and tmsnrt.rs/2sEoUHL). Funds still had a net long position of 357 million barrels in crude but it had been cut from 589 million barrels on May 30 and a record 951 million barrels on Feb. 21 (tmsnrt.rs/2uhe8Ju). Growing doubts about the effectiveness of OPEC’s production cuts, coupled with increases in crude output from Libya, Nigeria, Canada and the United States have prompted a wave of short-selling. And concerns about the health of gasoline demand and high level inventories in the United States have added to the bearishness within the hedge fund community. Fund managers have ramped up short positions in NYMEX WTI by 86 million barrels over the last four weeks, in the most aggressive short-selling cycle since the start of 2015 (tmsnrt.rs/2t8NQuy). But the sheer number of short sales left the market looking imbalanced and vulnerable to a short-covering rally (“Hedge funds hold near-record short positions in petroleum”, Reuters, June 27). Crude prices have now risen for seven consecutive trading sessions as the pace of short sales slows and some hedge fund managers have been emboldened to start adding long positions in anticipation of a rally. Hedge funds quietly added 3 million barrels of extra long positions in gasoline, 0.7 million in heating oil and 9 million in WTI in the week to June 27 (though this was offset by a continued reduction of 20 million in Brent). Fund managers are likely to have closed out at least some of their short positions as prices have risen consistently over the last week. The U.S. oil rig count fell slightly last week for the first time since early January which accelerated the short covering and provided a boost to oil prices at the end of the week. The critical question for the market is how many of those short positions have been closed out and how many more are still open. If many of the extra short positions have been closed, prices are likely to stabilise around current levels, but if most remain open, upward pressure is likely to continue.

At this preliminary point in the investigation, there is no information that suggests the crash was intentional,  the Massachusetts State Police said in a statement. Slideshow (7 Images)Local media, citing unnamed sources, said the taxi driver may have hit the gas instead of the brake pedal. Police said they were interviewing the driver, a 56-year-old man from Cambridge, Massachusetts. Boston police officers, as well as fire and emergency services personnel, were on the scene of the crash, which occurred in the city's East Boston section, the Massachusetts State Police said in a Twitter post.  Preliminary reports indicate several pedestrians with injuries, varying severity,  the police said. At least 10 people were taken to hospitals after the crash, Boston Emergency Medical Services said in a Twitter message. Video footage on CNN showed what appeared to be a taxi, with its front hood buckled, resting next to a building.

Havana, the capital of the Caribbean island, boasted dozens of such  posadas  until the 1990s, when the remaining few were given to Cubans left homeless by hurricanes. Privacy has became all the more elusive for lovers, given a housing shortage that forces many families to live in the same apartment and couples to live together long after their divorce. Private establishments have filled in the gap for some, the trade union weekly wrote, but many cannot afford to pay around $5, or a sixth of the average monthly state wage, for three hours of bliss. The less fortunate must resort to  parks, dark staircases, the beach and even the Malecon (seafront),  Trabajadores wrote. But now the state wants to make lovemaking easier again.  We want to revive this service that is in high demand, has a big social impact and without a doubt is very profitable,  Alfonso Muñoz Chang of the Provincial Housing Company of Havana was cited as saying.  We will start with what we call Hotel Vento, a two-storey building with 16 rooms with bathrooms.   The city needs this,  Hotel Vento administrator Maria Sterling was cited as saying, noting that employees would be  very enthusiastic  as wages would likely rise with the extra work. Next, authorities will restore some once-famous love motels like La Monumental to their former glory and convert another hotel, Muñoz Chang said.  To think about how to diversify options for love is not farfetched,  Trabajadores wrote.  It is a reality that concerns everyone, and cannot become a luxury.

It was not to be. The 39-year-old German, awarded a wildcard for his 16th and final appearance at the All England Club, had to accept his body was  not cooperating anymore  as he slumped to a 6-2 3-6 6-3 7-5 first-round defeat by Belgian qualifier Ruben Bemelmans. Haas, who made his Wimbledon debut in 1997 when grand-slam winning compatriots Boris Becker and Michael Stich were still playing, was in reflective mood after being given a standing ovation by the crowd crammed around an intimate Court 16.  Yeah, lots of emotions. Of course never great to lose in the first round. But happy to have been back, happy to have given it another try, happy to be playing in front of my close family, my kids,  said Haas, once ranked second in the world.  Had a few chances to win the fourth set with a couple of set points. Who knows what could have happened in the fifth, I would have loved to have played one. Yeah, that's it. Simple as that.  Yet Haas' career has been anything but  simple . In his 21-year professional career, he has been poked and prodded by a surgeon's knife more times then he cares to remember. Shoulders, elbows and hips have all needed medical attention at various times, but that has not prevented the patched-up German playing some of his best tennis late in his career. What he is capable of producing was in evidence just three weeks ago when, ranked 302, he stunned the sporting world by humbling Federer in the second round of the grasscourt tournament in Stuttgart. That result earned Haas the bragging rights of being the lowest-ranked player to beat the 18-times grand slam champion since 1999 -- but it carried little weight at Wimbledon on Monday. Many Memories Instead of looking forward to another match, Haas was left to nurse his sore body and reflect on a wealth of memories.  I have been on the tour for so long, there are so many highs and lows,  said Haas, who earlier this year presented Federer with the winner's trophy in his role as Indian Wells tournament director.  It took a lot of work and effort to get back to a certain stage for me to be come back out here and give it my best and be competitive.  As a tournament director, it was a great experience... presenting Roger, a close friend of mine, with the trophy was great.  And then, obviously, playing him again and getting a victory over him is also unbelievable.  But no matter what his heart says, Haas knows that the time has come when he has to listen to his head and body.   It's just tough to realize the fact that your body is not cooperating anymore. Every morning you wake up you have to hope that everything is stable,  said Haas, a semi-finalist here in 2009.  Yesterday, unfortunately, the lower back tightened up a little bit so it was tough for me to move around today.   But I.m happy to have somehow made it out on the court and I just have to continue to fight that battle until I know it's finally done.

Brazil was one of the world's fastest growing markets for the wind power sector in the first half of the decade with a flurry of farms appearing along the nation's vast, windy coast. But a deep recession that began in early 2014 and from which Brazil is only now emerging brought the trend to a halt. The last licenses for new wind or solar generation projects were awarded in 2015. An auction for licenses was called off in 2016 and it is unlikely new licenses will be issued this year.  We cannot choose a segment and say it is insulated from the crisis, give it a guaranteed demand,  Deputy Energy Minister Paulo Pedrosa said at a Sao Paulo conference last week.  Strictly considering the technical side, we have to say no.  Pedrosa said the government has received requests from wind and solar equipment makers to resume licensing. He said pressure also comes from governors of states holding the bulk of the wind generation capacity in Brazil. Despite those pressures, Pedrosa said it was impossible to even guess when the government will resume licensing for the projects. When it was booming at the turn of the decade, Brazil attracted global wind turbine manufacturers such as Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems, U.S.'s GE and Spain's Gamesa, who built plants in the country. Their order books are increasingly thinner, as old projects mature and there is no fresh demand. Newcomers such as photovoltaic panel makers BYD and Canadian Solar are likely to feel the orders' drought as well. Erik Rego, a power sector consultant at Excelência Energética, agreed with the government's stance. He said there is no need for new projects unless the government decides to stimulate the industry and build a buffer for when power consumption increases. Since there is no demand from power distributors to buy power forward, one way to create new projects would be to include them in a government plan to build spare capacity as a way to guarantee supply when demand increases rapidly, Rego said. But since this has a cost that in the end would have to be financed by consumers, there is resistance in the government to carrying such a plan out.

More than 20 states, including Virginia, Kentucky, California, New York and Massachusetts, have declined to provide some or all of the information that the panel requested, saying it was unnecessary and violated privacy. Republican Trump created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May after making unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in last November's election. Calling the request  repugnant,  Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a statement that his office had advised the State Board of Elections that the commission's request was illegal. The request  appears designed only to intimidate voters and to indulge President Trump’s fantasy that he won the popular vote,  Frosh said. The commission sent a letter to the 50 states asking them to turn over voter information including names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliations, felony convictions and voting histories.

The current battle is for second, and a place against Pinera in a Dec. 17 run-off. Center-left candidate Alejandro Guillier has 15 percent of votes and Beatriz Sanchez of the left-wing Frente Amplio, a new coalition, gained support over the past month and is technically tied with 13 percent, according to Gfk.

Every summer, some of Wall Street's biggest wealth management firms organize events catering to future heirs of their ultra-wealthy clients, hoping they can teach them a thing or two about money, and plant the seeds for what banks hope will be fruitful business relationships down the line. Wealth managers see a big opportunity in the millennial generation, those born between 1980 and 2000, who are expected to inherit an estimated $30 trillion from their Baby Boomer parents over the next 30 years, on top of their own earnings. The millennials already control nearly $17 trillion, or 10 percent, of the world's wealth, and that figure is expected to rise to $35.3 trillion, or 16 percent, by 2020, according to the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). But capturing millennials' attention has been difficult for wealth managers like Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and UBS Group AG (UBSG.S), because of cultural differences between generations and competition from digital startups called roboadvisers. Of the assets under management at private banks, only about 6 percent belong to millennials, according to BCG. Conferences like the one held by Morgan Stanley are an attempt to get young adults to warm up to Wall Street wealth managers. Held a block away from the bank's midtown Manhattan headquarters, there were about 50 guests, aged 18 to 35, whose parents are Private Wealth Management clients. That business caters to those who invest at least $20 million with the bank. In addition to  Time for a prenup? , other popular panels included  Show Me the Money! Investing 101  and  Communicate Like a Leader.  Citi's private bank has been holding similar events on three continents this year, including one in Silicon Valley last month. It was for clients' children who have been identified as the successors to family businesses, and it focused on how to use major innovations in technology, like artificial intelligence, to grow the bottom line.  If anyone thinks that just by organizing a boot camp that you can earn (clients' kids) trust, you're fooling yourself,  said Money Kanagasabapathy, who goes by the name Money K and is the global head of next generation programs for Citi Private Bank.  You have to really inspire them and hope that they at least continue having the conversation with you.  Darya Pishevar, whose father, Shervin Pishevar, is a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, attended the Morgan Stanley event last week. Though she is still in high school, Pishevar said she was interested in the sessions on leadership and impact investing because her family may create a foundation. Across the room, 28-year-old medical researcher Emilia Javorsky said she wanted advice on launching a medical device business. While she was not sure she would use Morgan Stanley in her business dealings, she said the conference made her feel good about the bank.  It made them feel more accessible,  Javorsky said.  When you don't come from a financial services background, it can be daunting. This made it less daunting.

Nearly 40 percent of the 296 athletes currently serving suspensions from international competition because of doping - taking performance-enhancing drugs - are women, and about half of these tested positive for androgens, the study team writes in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.  Some women, though, have naturally high levels of androgens, and there is controversy as to whether they should be allowed to compete, the authors note. “The quantitative relationship between enhanced testosterone levels and improved athletic performance should be taken into account when the eligibility of women with hyperandrogenism to compete in the female category of competition is discussed,” the researchers write. Dr. Stephane Bermon from the University of the Cote d’Azur in Nice, France, and the Monaco Institute of Sports Medicine and Surgery and Dr. Pierre-Yves Garnier from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Health and Science in Monaco investigated whether androgen levels affected athletic performance in 1,332 women and 795 men who participated in track and field events at IAAF World Championships in 2011 and 2013.  Overall, 44 female athletes had elevated free testosterone levels and 101 male athletes had below-normal free testosterone levels, the researchers found. Among the 24 female athletes whose total testosterone levels were high, nine had naturally elevated levels as a result of a condition called hyperandrogenic disorder of sex development, another nine were found to have been doping and six were impossible to classify.  Higher testosterone levels in female athletes translated into 2.73 percent better performance in 400-meter runs, 2.78 percent better performance in 400-meter hurdles and 1.78 percent better performance in 800-meter runs compared to women competitors with normal testosterone levels.  The difference was most pronounced in the hammer-throw events, where women with higher testosterone performed 4.53 percent better, and pole vault, where they did 2.94 percent better.  While these improvements sound tiny, in elite athletes they are enough to turn also-rans into medalists. Interestingly, the researchers found no significant difference in performance when comparing male elite athletes with the highest and lowest free testosterone levels.

At Wimbledon on Monday, Rafa Nadal, who had not played a competitive match on grass for two years, destroyed Australia's John Millman in straight sets by standing on the baseline and blasting out topspin ground strokes, just as he did to win the French Open a month ago. Wimbledon's grass is slower than when Sampras and all the classic serve-volley specialists ruled the roost and, though it still offers a lower bounce than clay or the hard courts that dominate the circuit, it seems that the difference is becoming marginal.  It would be nice if every surface has its own characteristics, and Wimbledon and grass courts should be faster,  said German crowd favorite Dustin Brown after his first-round victory over Joao Sousa.  I had the feeling that sometimes playing at the French Open might even be a little faster, just from the balls and the courts. It's a little sad because, personally, I think a lot of guys that are attacking and play serve-and-volley, like Feliciano Lopez or Gilles Muller, are all playing a lot less serve-and-volley. I think that's because everything is playing pretty slow.

I think I had good feelings with the ball during the whole week of practice on grass, but on grass you meet players that they can be very aggressive, and anything can happen.  Slideshow (5 Images)Nadal has failed to get past the fourth round on his last four appearances at Wimbledon. But Sweden's Mats Wilander, who, like the Spaniard, won grand slam titles on grass, clay and hard court, thinks the difference is not so marked these days, and backed him to do well.  The courts here are drying out really quickly, which will suit Rafa,  Wilander told Reuters.  I don't think these courts are necessarily playing much quicker (than hard courts), but they play lower.

Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at BrewersBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchMiley hasn't worked past the fifth inning in his last six starts and has failed to get through three complete in three of those contests.  He hasn't been able to command the baseball in games,  Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said.  Everything else is there so that tells you that there's some other challenges going on.  Manny Pina and Orlando Arcia finished with three hits each for the Brewers, who collected 10 on the day.  We did a nice job,  Counsell said.  We only had one extra-base hit. ... That's a bunch of guys having good at-bats. We made him work. We were disciplined, we didn't chase and we kept making him work.  Milwaukee sent nine men to the plate in the first and added three more in the second, with Miley (3-7) giving way after Pina's two-run double made it a 7-0 game. Baltimore got on the board in the third when Ruben Tejada singled, advanced on an error and scored when Jimmy Yacabonis, who took over for Miley, recorded his first career hit with a single. Arcia led off the bottom of the inning with a single but appeared to be in trouble when he slid past third on Suter's base hit. Arcia got up and started toward home, getting caught in a rundown that allowed Suter to move to second. But the Orioles couldn't apply a tag and Arcia got past three Baltimore players to cross home plate and put the Brewers up seven.  Once I over-slid, at that point there was no going back,  Arcia said through team interpreter Carlos Brizuela.  There was just going home.  It was just the latest highlight-reel moment for Arcia, whose reached base in 10 straight games and is batting .500 during that stretch with three doubles, three home runs and seven RBIs.  That was incredible, what a pickle,  Suter said.  How he scored was incredible. Every day he does something that makes you say  oh, my goodness.  And he's been hitting the 'schnikey's' out of the ball. It's great to see.  The victory allowed the NL Central-leading Brewers to pick up a half-game on the second-place Chicago Cubs. The Cubs were off Monday and will open a three-game interleague series Tuesday at Tampa Bay 2 1/2 games back. NOTES: Brewers 3B Travis Shaw was struck in the left hand by a pitch and left the game after two innings for  precautionary reasons,  the team announced. X-rays revealed no fracture and Shaw is considered day-to-day. ... RHP Michael Blazek worked two scoreless innings Monday after his contract was selected from Triple-A Colorado Springs. A reliever with the Brewers the last two seasons, Blazek was moved into a starting role with Colorado Springs but will fill a multiple-inning role in the bullpen, Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. ... To make room for Blazek on the active roster, Milwaukee optioned RHP Paulo Espino to Colorado Springs. ... Orioles LHP Zach Britton was slated to work an inning Monday night for Class A Frederick in his fourth and final minor league rehab appearance. ... The Orioles and Brewers met for the first time since 2014. ... RHP Ubaldo Jimenez (3-3, 6.48 ERA) and RHP Jimmy Nelson (6-4, 3.43) face off Tuesday afternoon as the three-game interleague series continues.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-orioles-brewers-writethru-idUSMTZED73J9BYHQ"},

The IPO will be a key test of Dropbox's worth after it was valued at almost $10 billion in a private fundraising round in 2014. Dropbox will begin interviewing investment banks in the coming weeks, the sources said, asking not to be named because the deliberations are private. Dropbox declined to comment. Several big U.S. technology companies such as Uber Technologies Inc and Airbnb Inc have resisted going public in recent months, concerned that stock market investors, who focus more on profitability than do private investors, would assign lower valuations to them. Snap, owner of the popular messaging app Snapchat, was forced to lower its IPO valuation expectations earlier this year amid investor concern over its unproven business model. Its shares have since lingered just above the IPO price, with investors troubled by widening losses and missed analyst estimates. It has a market capitalization of $21 billion. Drew Houston, Chief Executive Officer and founder of Dropbox, stands in front of the company's logo at an announcement event in San Francisco, California, U.S., January 30, 2017.Beck Diefenbach - RTX2YW3UStill, for many private companies, there is increasing pressure to go pubic as investors look to cash out.  Proceeds from technology IPOs slumped to $6.7 billion in2015 from $34 billion in 2014, and shrunk further to $2.9 billion in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.

San Francisco-based Dropbox, which was founded in 2007 by Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduates Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, counts Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price and Greylock Partners as investors. Dropbox started as a free service for consumers to share and store photos, music and other large files. That business became commoditized though, as Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) started offering storage for free.  Dropbox has since pivoted to focus on winning business clients, and Houston, the company's CEO, has said that Dropbox is on track to generate more than $1 billion in revenue this year.  The company has expanded its Dropbox Business that requires companies to pay a fee based on the number of employees who use it. The service in January began offering Smart Sync, which allows users to see and access all of their files, whether stored in the cloud or on a local hard drive, from their desktop.

The measure, which passed in a 72-36 vote and includes a way to pay down the state's $15 billion unpaid bill backlog, follows the House's approval on Sunday of a $36 billion spending bill and a revenue bill boosting taxes by $5 billion that Governor Bruce Rauner has vowed to veto. All three measures, which passed the Democratic-controlled chamber with the support of some Republicans, are destined for votes in the Senate.  John Patterson, a spokesman for Democratic Senate President John Cullerton, said the Senate will be in session on Tuesday  to vote on a balanced budget.   Earlier on Monday, Cullerton told reporters it would be “very difficult” to pass the House-approved budget package without support from Senate Republicans, who rejected a similar tax increase that passed the Senate with 32 Democratic votes in May. Now, 36 votes are necessary to pass the budget legislation. Related CoverageFactbox: Beyond New Jersey and Maine, seven other states also have no budgets I don't want to call a bill and have it fail,  Cullerton said. He said he would like to re-enter negotiations with Republicans on stalled so-called reforms, including a local property tax freeze, sought by Rauner and his legislative allies in order to win their backing on a budget.  A stalemate between the state's Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nation's fifth-largest state without a complete budget for two-straight fiscal years. While fiscal 2018 began on Saturday, lawmakers have been scrambling to piece together a spending and revenue plan to avoid Illinois becoming the first-ever U.S. state to be rated junk. Fitch Ratings on Monday cited  concrete progress  on the budget front, but warned that a downgrade of its BBB rating was still possible in the case of a budget that is temporary, partial or that is enacted beyond the current legislative session. S&P;, which rates Illinois one notch above junk at BBB-minus, called the House action  a meaningful step.   If a budget is enacted, the degree to which it closes the state's structural deficit, provides a pathway for addressing the backlog of unpaid bills, and its impact on cash flows, will be important factors in our review of its effect on Illinois' credit quality,  S&P; said in a statement.  House Speaker Michael Madigan predicted Senate passage of the budget bills and said there would be an override effort in his chamber should the governor veto any of the measures. He also condemned what he described as  undue intimidation  by the governor, which he said caused a mass defection of House Republicans away from Rauner’s positions on the budget. The House-passed budget implementation bill includes a plan aimed at reducing the state's backlog of unpaid bills, which ballooned to about $15 billion due to the budget impasse, by $8 billion. One element of the plan calls for the issuance of up to $6 billion of general obligation bonds. Illinois already pays the biggest interest rate penalty among states in the U.S. municipal bond market, and a junk rating would make selling new debt difficult and expensive. In addition to the bonds, the legislation allows money to be borrowed from Illinois' myriad of funds allocated for specific purposes. State Representative Greg Harris, the House Democrats' budget point person, said enough money has been identified only to cover debt service on $3 billion of bonds and that the rest of the debt could be issued once additional revenue is available.

In all, nine U.S. states have not yet passed budgets for the new fiscal year that kicked off for most states on July 1, a figure characterized as high by John Hicks, the executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers.  Illinois, New Jersey, Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have not yet adopted a budget. Governors in New Jersey and Maine have taken the additional measure of imposing a partial government shutdown until a budget deal is reached. Hicks cited lower than projected income tax and sales tax receipts as a main culprit for the larger-than-usual number of states with budgetary challenges this year. Pension liabilities and healthcare costs are also growing for states, he said. The following lists key details on the nine states without budgets for the new fiscal year: Illinois With Illinois entering its third fiscal year without a budget, state lawmakers are scrambling to pass a spending and revenue plan to avoid the state's credit rating being downgraded to junk. On Monday, the state House of Representatives passed a bill for the third and final piece of the fiscal 2018 budget, and the measures are pending in the Senate. New Jersey New Jersey state parks, courts, beaches and other offices were closed on Monday in a partial government shutdown. Republican Governor Chris Christie wants to force nonprofit health insurer Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield to spend some of its billions of reserves on public drug addiction programs, but Democratic Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto has resisted the measure, which Christie has tied to the state budget. Maine A budget standoff between Maine's Republican governor, Paul LePage, and Democratic lawmakers has shut down nonessential state services there. Negotiations over a $7 billion, two-year budget revolve around LePage's insistence on deep spending cuts instead of tax hikes. Connecticut Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, took emergency control of state spending amid political discord over how to close a $5.1 billion budget gap over the next two years. State offices are open, but funding to nonprofit social service agencies is slashed. Massachusetts Massachusetts' roughly $40 billion full budget is in limbo after lawmakers failed to reach a compromise over cutting spending in light of declining revenue forecasts. Lawmakers did pass a $5.15 billion interim stopgap budget to keep the government open. Oregon Oregon is  just finishing up,  said Hicks. The state government is working through the budget agency by agency, said Savannah Gilmore, a research analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures, who estimated the process should be finished fairly soon. Rhode Island Turmoil hit Rhode Island's budget process at the last minute on Friday night when its Democratic-controlled Senate amended a $9.2 billion budget already passed by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. House members refused to come back and square up the revised plan, meaning the state still has no budget. Services are not affected because Rhode Island by law continues to operate under the previous budget. Pennsylvania Pennsylvania lawmakers passed a $32 billion state spending plan last Friday but no revenue package as they wrestled with how to close a $2.3 billion deficit. Democratic Governor Tom Wolf had 10 days from when the bill was passed to sign or veto it before the spending measure becomes law automatically. WISCONSINThe Wisconsin government's primary disagreement centers on transportation funding, Hicks said, adding that education funding had not yet been settled. Late budgets, however, are not especially uncommon for Wisconsin, said Katie Quinn, a research analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Based on Santander's closing price of 6.002 euros on Monday, the 1.46 billion new shares will be issued at a discount of 19 percent and existing shareholders will have until July 20 to decide whether they use their preferential subscription right to buy or not into the capital increase.

If a budget is enacted, the degree to which it closes the state's structural deficit, provides a pathway for addressing the backlog of unpaid bills, and its impact on cash flows, will be important factors in our review of its effect on Illinois' credit quality,  S&P; said in a statement.  House Speaker Michael Madigan predicted Senate passage of the budget bills and said there would be an override effort in his chamber should the governor veto any of the measures. He also condemned what he described as  undue intimidation  by the governor, which he said caused a mass defection of House Republicans away from Rauner’s positions on the budget. The House-passed budget implementation bill includes a plan aimed at reducing the state's backlog of unpaid bills, which ballooned to about $15 billion due to the budget impasse, by $8 billion. One element of the plan calls for the issuance of up to $6 billion of general obligation bonds. Illinois already pays the biggest interest rate penalty among states in the U.S. municipal bond market, and a junk rating would make selling new debt difficult and expensive. In addition to the bonds, the legislation allows money to be borrowed from Illinois' myriad of funds allocated for specific purposes. State Representative Greg Harris, the House Democrats' budget point person, said enough money has been identified only to cover debt service on $3 billion of bonds and that the rest of the debt could be issued once additional revenue is available.

The health ministry said Haiti has had about 7,400 suspected new cholera cases since the start of the year, compared with  almost 20,200 at the same point last year.  We have never seen so few cases,  Donald Francois, head of the health ministry's national cholera program told Reuters in an interview.  With the cases we've seen we think we can eliminate cholera by the end of 2018.  There were more than 18,600 cases in the first six months of 2015 and some 7,451 in the same period in 2014, according to  health ministry figures. An estimated 9,300 people have died and more than 800,000 have fallen ill from cholera since U.N. peacekeepers accidentally introduced the disease in 2010 when they dumped infected sewage into a river outside of Port-au-Prince. A program to provide residents with water purification tablets and efforts to find the source of new outbreaks has likely led to the decline in cases, said Marc Vincent, the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) representative for Haiti. A cholera vaccination drive in November targeting more than 800,000 people also probably boosted immunity, Vincent said. Still, with funds to combat cholera slow to trickle in and Haiti needing vast improvements to its water and sanitation systems, the country remains vulnerable to new outbreaks. About 40 percent of Haiti's population are without daily access to clean water and less than one in four residents has regular use of a toilet, according to Pan-American Health Organization and World Bank figures.  The number of reported cases can certainly decline dramatically and even fall to zero. Most likely, though, there will continue to be a low-level number of cases, maybe seasonally, maybe year-round,  said Ronald Waldman, a global health professor at George Washington University. Waldman said Haiti could expect periodic spikes of cholera during natural disasters such as hurricanes. Former U.N. secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon apologized in December for the handling of the outbreak and announced a $400-million trust fund to fight cholera and to rebuild communities struck by the illness. But countries have been slow to contribute to the fund. So far, seven countries have given $2.67 million, nearly all of which has been spent, according to the United Nations.

The opposition, starting a fourth month of street protests against the socialist government it decries as a dictatorship, will organize the symbolic vote for July 16 as part of its strategy to delegitimize the unpopular Maduro.  Venezuelans will also be asked their view on the military's responsibility for  recovering constitutional order  and the formation of a new  national unity  government, the Democratic Unity coalition announced.   Let the people decide!  said Julio Borges, the president of the opposition-led National Assembly, confirming what two senior opposition sources told Reuters earlier on Monday. The opposition's planned vote, likely to be dismissed by the government, would be two weeks ahead of a planned July 30 vote proposed by Maduro for a Constituent Assembly with powers to reform the constitution and supersede other institutions.  The government is trying to formalize dictatorship,  said opposition leader Henrique Capriles, warning the South American OPEC nation was approaching  zero hour . According to a recent survey by pollster Datanalisis, seven  in 10 Venezuelans are opposed to rewriting the constitution, which was reformed by late leader Hugo Chavez in 1999. Maduro, 54, Chavez's unpopular successor, says the assembly is the only way to bring peace to Venezuela after the deaths of at least 84 people in and around anti-government unrest since the start of April.  The people have a right to vote and the people will vote on July 30, rain or shine!  Maduro said to cheers during a speech at an open-air event on Monday with candidates to the new assembly, during which he also prayed and danced.  Opponents say Maduro's plan is a ruse to consolidate the ruling Socialist Party's grip on power and avoid a conventional free election that opinion polls show he would lose.  Venezuelan opposition leader and Governor of Miranda state Henrique Capriles attends a meeting of the Venezuelan coalition of opposition parties (MUD) in Caracas, Venezuela July 3, 2017.Carlos Garcia RawlinsCritics also accuse the government of threatening people with layoffs or loss of state-provided homes if they do not vote. Maduro on Monday urged state workers to participate, saying for instance that every single employee of state oil company PDVSA should cast a ballot.  'Darkness' Not Forever The next presidential vote is due by the end of 2018, but protesters have been demanding it be brought forward, even as Maduro's opponents worry about how free and fair such a vote would be. Slideshow (15 Images)The two highest-profile potential opposition candidates for a presidential election are Capriles, who has been barred from holding office, and Leopoldo Lopez, who is in jail.    Opposition protesters also want solutions to a crushing  economic crisis, freedom for hundreds of jailed activists, and independence for the National Assembly.   Maduro, a former foreign minister who was narrowly elected in 2013 after Chavez's death from cancer, says protesting opponents are seeking a coup with U.S. support. His allies say that a new Constituent Assembly would annul the existing legislature and would also remove chief state prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who has split with the socialists during the crisis and become a thorn in their side. Officials have turned on Ortega and are petitioning the Supreme Court to remove her. On Monday, the comptroller's office announced a national audit of state prosecutors' offices. Ortega's office described it as  revenge for the current institutional crisis  and accused comptroller officials of  abuses  in trying to enter buildings without prior notice.  The darkness does not last forever nor does it extend in its totality,  Ortega said in an address to the National Assembly.  We must make big efforts to reactivate the institutional and electoral paths.

Horowitz's departure comes amid allegations of sexual harassment, according to reports by The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times. Reuters could not independently verify those allegations. Horowitz's attorney, Patricia Glaser, a partner with Glaser Weil, called Fox's treatment of Horowitz  appalling.   At no point in his tenure was there any mention by his superiors or human resources of any misconduct or an inability to adhere to professional conduct,  Glaser said in a statement.  Any slanderous accusations to the contrary will be vigorously defended.  A spokeswoman for Fox Sports, part of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, declined to comment further on Horowitz's departure, which was effective immediately. Daniel Petrocelli, an attorney with O’Melveny & Myers, which is representing Fox Sports, said in a statement that Horowitz's departure was  fully warranted,  and he called the accusations by Horowitz's attorney  ill-informed and misguided.  In the memo to employees, which was seen by Reuters, Eric Shanks, president of Fox Sports, wrote that everyone at Fox Sports  should act with respect and adhere to professional conduct at all times. These values are non-negotiable.  Horowitz's dismissal comes at a sensitive time for 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch and is awaiting regulatory approval of its $15.2 billion acquisition of the UK’s Sky Plc. Sexual harassment claims and lawsuits at another 21st Century Fox unit, Fox News, which led to the departures of former Chair Roger Ailes and star anchor Bill O'Reilly, have caused some investor concern about the future of the unit. However, unlike at Fox News, there has been no litigation or settlements involving behavior at Fox Sports, according to a person familiar with the situation, who wished to remain anonymous because the matter is private. In the memo, Shanks said he would take over Horowitz's responsibilities until a replacement is named. Horowitz had been in his position at Fox Sports since May 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile.

The Swiss three times grand slam champion was out-gunned by 21-year-old Medvedev, who had the Centre Court crowd on their feet as he pulled off a dazzling array of winners to wrap up a 6-4 3-6 6-4 6-1 victory on his first Wimbledon appearance.  Yet how much of the stunning upset was down to Medvedev's ability to fire freely from both flanks and how much of it was down to Wawrinka's discomfort was hard to tell.  The Russian, making only his third grand slam appearance and who is ranked 46 places below the world number three, was full of energy as he hauled his giant frame around the court.

Slideshow (10 Images)The Russian broke to love in the fifth game of the first set, and crafted two more break points in the seventh as the 32-year-old Wawrinka reeled under a barrage of heavy hitting. The Swiss briefly sparked into life at the start of the second, leveling the match after breaking for a 2-0 lead and then breaking for a second time in the eighth game after Medvedev had clawed his way back on serve.  They went toe-to-toe in the third set before Wawrinka sent a forehand wide in the 10th game to give the Russian a set point, which he gobbled up to edge back in front.  There was to be no way back for Wawrinka, who was then completely outgunned as Medvedev raced clear in the fourth set, breaking twice to go 5-1 ahead.  He fired down his 10th ace to bring up match point and wrapped up the victory when Wawrinka sent a forehand long, with the Centre Court rising as one to acclaim his efforts.

An index of U.S. national factory activity tracked by the Institute for Supply Management rose to 57.8 last month, the strongest reading since August 2014, driving U.S. 10-year yields to their highest levels in seven weeks.     The figures allayed some concerns over the pace of economic recovery that had left traders skeptical of the Federal Reserve's stated plan of raising U.S. rates once more before the end of 2017 and another three times next year.     Faster policy tightening could dampen the allure of high-yielding emerging market assets, weighing on the value of their currencies.     Mexico's peso weakened 0.56 percent against the dollar, tracking currencies from other emerging markets, and reaching its lowest level in over a week. Trading volumes were thin ahead of the U.S. July Fourth holiday on Tuesday.     The benchmark Mexican stock index tracked Wall Street higher, rising to a lifetime high and closing up 0.5 percent.     The Brazilian real rose slightly. Traders pointed to receding fears that a corruption scandal could delay President Michel Temer's agenda of economic structural reforms.

The results add to the ongoing debate over the safety of contact sports in adolescence, but the study's senior author said the findings may not apply to today's high school athletes.  The big caution is that these findings may not generalize to high school football today, because the game has changed a lot,  said Dylan Small, of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.  The players are generally bigger and youth sports have become much more professionalized.  Earlier research has found higher rates of a brain condition known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), other brain ailments and mental health issues later in life among former professional football players, the researchers write in JAMA Neurology. Not much is known about how concussions and hits to the head among U.S. high school football players might be linked with these outcomes, though. For the new study, the researchers used data from 3,904 men who graduated Wisconsin high schools in 1957. The men were enrolled in the study during their senior year and then monitored throughout their lives.  The researchers had data measuring brain and mental health for 2,692 of the men at age 65. To test cognition, the men were first asked to recall words and then to say all the words they know starting with specific letters. They were evaluated for depression using a standard scale.  Overall, at age 65, cognition and depression scores were no worse among the former football players than among the men who never played the sport during high school. Scores were similar when the men were tested again at age 72 years.  What our study is kind of saying is that the dose of football in the 1950s for the average player didn’t carry big risk, but we don’t know what that says about the current risk,  Small told Reuters Health. Also, he said, the findings only address the average risk for all the former players who participated. The study can't show whether some men are at an increased for cognition problems and depression if they played a certain position or suffered concussions. Dr. Kristine Yaffe, of the University of California, San Francisco, agreed that the study can't say people who suffer multiple concussions aren't going to experience problems later in life.  It does say - on average - participation in football doesn't carry deleterious cognitive outcomes later in life,  said Yaffee, who co-authored an editorial accompanying the new study. She said more studies that follow people who suffer hits to the head are needed to see how they fare, but those are difficult to conduct. Some are in the works, though. Small said his team is hoping to examine a similar set of data collected from people who graduated high school in the 1970s to get information on more recent exposures. Yaffe said research on effects of brain injuries on health in later life is still evolving.  This is a new field and there is a lot we don’t know about it,  she said.

Talks over a potential 35 billion euro ($40 billion) deal and its potential structure are still at an early stage and there is no certainty over their outcome, four sources said, although Gas Natural chairman Isidre Faine has already sounded out his Portuguese counterpart Antonio Mexia about a tie-up. A deal would create an Iberian champion competing with France's Engie (ENGIE.PA) and EDF (EDF.PA) and not far behind heavyweights Enel (ENEI.MI) and Iberdrola (IBE.MC). And it could trigger a long expected wave of consolidation among Europe's biggest utilities as they seek to gain scale and shift their revenue streams toward renewables to protect profits from steep competition and narrower margins. A Gas Natural-EDP merger is seen as a good strategic fit as EDP has made big headway in renewable power while Gas Natural remains strong in gas-fired or coal generated electricity. The two have a complementary footprint, especially in Latin America where the Spanish firm is strong in Chile and Mexico and the Portuguese group in Brazil as well as in the United States.  The combination of the two companies is quite attractive as Gas Natural lacks power generation in Latam and renewables. But the key to the deal is the politics , said a major shareholder in one of the two firms. EDP declined to comment. Gas Natural said it was not in merger talks with EDP.  Cross-Border Deals Any attempt to consolidate Europe's fragmented energy market has so far raised eyebrows among European competition authorities who fear it could translate into higher prices. But sector insiders say the mood for cross-border deals has changed since the French election victory of Emmanuel Macron who has been a strong advocate of creating European champions. Meanwhile, Spain's prime minister Mariano Rajoy and his Portuguese counterpart Antonio Costa, are working on increasing connections between the energy grids of the two countries and with Europe and none of either group's main shareholders is seen as raising objections if the price is attractive. A merger would also mark the latest effort by Spain's Criteria, which owns direct or indirect stakes in Caixabank (CABK.MC), Abertis (ABE.MC), Gas Natural, Repsol (REP.MC) or Telefonica (TEF.MC), to restructure its portfolio. The holding company, which is also managed by Faine, wants to focus on smaller stakes in bigger companies with potentially less political influence but higher financial returns.  Criteria, which is reviewing a potential tie-up between toll road operator Abertis and Italy's Atlantia (ATL.MI), declined to comment. But it has a track record for such deals and in 2014 exchanged 100 percent of Agbar for 5 percent of Suez (SEVI.PA).  Faine has done it with Agbar and is about to do it again with Atlantia and Abertis,  a source with knowledge of the deal said.  Now, he is looking towards Portugal to replicate the move with Gas Natural and EDP.

The 21-year-old, who has just broken into the top 50 in the world, played with real swagger in his 6-4 3-6 6-4 6-1 win over the fifth-seed and that confidence was evident when he talked to reporters after the win on his Wimbledon debut.  I didn't even look at my draw, like after the second round, so I don't know who I will play if I will be winning,  he said.   But after beating Stan, I mean, I feel good on grass. I will just try to play match-by-match, try to do my best, but I would say if I can reach a quarter-final, I would be happy.  Medvedev, who next faces 124th-ranked Belgian Ruben Bemelmans, was ranked 99th in the world at the start of the year but a strong run of form has seen him rise to 49th.  Few people, if any, however expected him to upset his Swiss opponent, a three-time grand slam champion. First of all, it's my first grand slam win. So even I guess if I didn't beat Stan, it would be one of the biggest wins in my life.  My first top-10 win. I have no words to describe this. I guess this memory will be with me forever,  he said. Strange Feeling Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 3, 2017   Russia’s Daniil Medvedev with Switzerland’s Stan Wawrinka after winning their first round matchAndrew CouldridgeMedvedev showed few signs of nerves despite playing such a high profile opponent on Centre Court in his first outing at the tournament. But he conceded that, inside at least, there were some butterflies.  Of course, it's a very strange feeling to go out there. It's like you have a fear, you're tight, but plus to this also, you want to show your best. You want to beat Stan Wawrinka on Centre Court so that people can know more about you,  he said. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 3, 2017   Russia’s Daniil Medvedev celebrates winning the first round match against Switzerland’s Stan WawrinkaAndrew Couldridge It was just something special. I don't know how to explain it,  he added. It is clear, though, that the Monte Carlo-based Medvedev has a strong belief in his ability on grass.  I think my game suits it really well, because I don't have, like, a huge serve but it's quite strong and very precise. So that's the best thing for grass, because with the grass it goes faster than on hard or clay,  he said.  Then I have a really flat game, which no one likes to play, because you have to put the ball up after my shots. I'm good at the key moments. So far I have been good at these key moments.  So, everything just makes me play well on grass, and that's my favorite surface,  he said. Asked whether he had had a feeling that he could pull off a surprise at Wimbledon, Medvedev said with a smile:  I love grass. I play well on grass. I beat a lot of good guys on grass. I knew that I can do well here.  Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Ken Ferris","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-wimbledon-medvedev-idUSKBN19O2IZ"},

Prime Minister Abdelmadjid Tebboune's plan follows the launch of an anonymous online campaign that blames African migrants - whose numbers are unofficially estimated at 100,000 - for taking jobs and spreading the HIV virus that causes AIDS. Youth unemployment is running at around 30 percent in Algeria, but the country also faces a shortfall of workers in some sectors as it tries to steer its economy away from over-reliance on oil and gas production. To determine the number of beneficiaries of the scheme, the interior ministry is organizing a census while security services will screen potential residency candidates.  They will get a residency document which will allow them to get a job,  Tebboune told lawmakers on Friday night.  We won't allow any NGO or individual to tarnish the image of our country.  He gave no further details on the scheme. African migrants in Algeria are mostly from Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso and have come to escape acute poverty and terrorism back home. Some use Algeria as a transit country en route to Europe via neighboring Libya.  That's great news, I will be happy if I can work under the framework of the law,  said a young Malian working illegally in a housing project as a mason in Ouled Fayet, west of Algiers. Tensions African migrants work at the construction site of a building in Algiers, Algeria June 29, 2017.Ramzi BoudinaTensions between Algerians and the migrants often boil over. A year ago in Bechar, in western Algeria, rioting broke out after a local woman was believed to have been kidnapped by the migrants. The online anti-migrant campaign has shocked many in Algeria, which sees itself as a leading influence in the Sahel region and more widely in Africa, for example negotiating a peace deal in 2015 in Mali. Slideshow (13 Images)The campaign also appears to have embarrassed the government in a country that takes pride in its history as a bastion of anti-colonialism after its own 1962 war of independence against France. Last month a hashtag  No to Africans in Algeria  was widely shared on Twitter and Facebook, calling for expulsions to protect Algerian families and prevent  chaos . Amnesty International's local representative, Hassina Oussedik, has urged the government to do more to protect African migrants.   Algeria has embarked on politically sensitive reforms to modernize its still largely state-run economy, but it has been hit hard by a crash in oil prices that has deprived the country of more than half of its revenues. The migrants already present in the economy tend to work illegally and are very often underpaid, human rights groups say. Some economists doubt the government's plan will make much difference to Algeria's workforce, while others view it as a way to further monitor traffic across its southern borders, where Islamist militant groups are active.  The goal of most of the migrants is definitely to reach the El Dorado in Europe,  economist Arslan Chikhaoui told Reuters.  Algeria is still only a transit destination.

Horowitz's departure comes amid allegations of sexual harassment, according to reports by The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times. Reuters could not independently verify those allegations.   Horowitz's attorney, Patricia Glaser, a partner with Glaser Weil, called Fox's treatment of Horowitz  appalling.   At no point in his tenure was there any mention by his superiors or human resources of any misconduct or an inability to adhere to professional conduct,  Glaser said in a statement.  Any slanderous accusations to the contrary will be vigorously defended.   A spokeswoman for Fox Sports, part of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O), declined to comment further on Horowitz's departure, which was effective immediately. Daniel Petrocelli, an attorney with O’Melveny & Myers, which is representing Fox Sports, said in a statement that Horowitz's departure was  fully warranted,  and he called the accusations by Horowitz's attorney  ill-informed and misguided.   In the memo to employees, which was seen by Reuters, Eric Shanks, president of Fox Sports, wrote that everyone at Fox Sports  should act with respect and adhere to professional conduct at all times. These values are non-negotiable.  Horowitz's dismissal comes at a sensitive time for 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch  and is awaiting regulatory approval of its $15.2 billion acquisition of the UK’s Sky Plc.  Sexual harassment claims and lawsuits at another 21st Century Fox unit, Fox News, which led to the departures of former Chair Roger Ailes and star anchor Bill O'Reilly, have caused some investor concern about the future of the unit.  However, unlike at Fox News, there has been no litigation or settlements involving behavior at Fox Sports, according to a person familiar with the situation, who wished to remain anonymous because the matter is private.  In the memo, Shanks said he would take over Horowitz's responsibilities until a replacement is named. Horowitz had been in his position at Fox Sports since May 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile. A Fox web page on Horowitz had been taken down on Monday.

The Dow Jones Transport Average index, which includes airlines, railroads and package delivery companies, is often viewed as a barometer of economic activity. The 20-component index eclipsed its March 1 intraday record of 9,639.33, rising as high as 9,681.88 during the session. It also tallied its first closing high since March 1, finishing at 9,639.63, up 0.8 percent on the day.  If people are looking for validation that the economy is still on pretty solid footing and can continue to kind of accelerate, that’s a good sign to see,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana and a contributing editor to the Dow Theory Forecasts newsletter. Dow Theory tracks the transports and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to confirm major trends in the stock market. While the Dow industrials have been setting successive record highs over the past six weeks, the transports slumped after March 1 and only recently surged back to record territory. A new closing high for the transports reconfirms the bull market trend, which  emboldens investors to buy the dips,  said Carlson.  Among the stocks giving the index the biggest lift on Monday  were freight and logistics company Landstar System Inc, trucking and transportation logistics company J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc and railroad Norfolk Southern Corp. The transports' record surge, on a shortened trading day ahead of the July Fourth holiday, came on a generally higher day for the broader market. The benchmark S&P; 500 rose 0.2 percent and the Dow industrials gained 0.6 percent, while a decline in the technology sector dragged the Nasdaq Composite 0.5 percent lower.  The Dow industrials' 8 percent rise in the first six months of the year marked their best first-half performance since 2013.

Both Brent and U.S. crude climbed more than 1 percent to resume its longest stretch of daily rallies in more than five years after data pointed to moderating U.S. output, pushing energy names higher.

Also helping sentiment was data that showed U.S. factory activity jumped in June to its highest level in almost three years suggesting economic growth in the second quarter gained some steam, while construction spending held steady in May. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 57.8 last month from 54.9 in May. In a bullish signal for the market, the Dow Transportation Average, which includes airlines, railroads and package delivery companies and is often viewed as a barometer of economic activity, closed at a record.   If (people) are comfortable with the economy, the transports certainly is a leading sector. If the economy is going to get better, transports, rails, truckers, airlines and all that stuff will do better in anticipation of that,  Polcari said.   Automakers advanced, with Ford up 3.3 percent and General Motors up 1.8 percent as vehicle sales figures for June showed retail sales to consumers were relatively stable at the U.S. automakers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.55-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.51-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Horowitz's departure comes amid allegations of sexual harassment, according to reports by The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times. Reuters could not independently verify those allegations.   Horowitz's attorney, Patricia Glaser, a partner with Glaser Weil, called Fox's treatment of Horowitz  appalling.   At no point in his tenure was there any mention by his superiors or human resources of any misconduct or an inability to adhere to professional conduct,  Glaser said in a statement.  Any slanderous accusations to the contrary will be vigorously defended.   A spokeswoman for Fox Sports, part of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O), declined to comment further on Horowitz's departure, which was effective immediately. Daniel Petrocelli, an attorney with O’Melveny & Myers, which is representing Fox Sports, said in a statement that Horowitz's departure was  fully warranted,  and he called the accusations by Horowitz's attorney  ill-informed and misguided.   In the memo to employees, which was seen by Reuters, Eric Shanks, president of Fox Sports, wrote that everyone at Fox Sports  should act with respect and adhere to professional conduct at all times. These values are non-negotiable.  Horowitz's dismissal comes at a sensitive time for 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch  and is awaiting regulatory approval of its $15.2 billion acquisition of the UK’s Sky Plc.  Sexual harassment claims and lawsuits at another 21st Century Fox unit, Fox News, which led to the departures of former Chair Roger Ailes and star anchor Bill O'Reilly, have caused some investor concern about the future of the unit.  However, unlike at Fox News, there has been no litigation or settlements involving behavior at Fox Sports, according to a person familiar with the situation, who wished to remain anonymous because the matter is private.  In the memo, Shanks said he would take over Horowitz's responsibilities until a replacement is named. Horowitz had been in his position at Fox Sports since May 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile. A Fox web page on Horowitz had been taken down on Monday.

Trump,William Miller,FACEBOOK,COURT/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON, July 3 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc is challenging a gag order from a U.S. court that is preventing the company from talking about three government search warrants that it said pose a threat to freedom of speech, according to court documents. Facebook said it wants to notify three users about the search warrants seeking their communications and information and also give those users an opportunity to object to the warrants, according to a filing in a Washington, D.C., appeals court seen by Reuters.  We believe there are important First Amendment concerns with this case, including the government's refusal to let us notify three people of broad requests for their account information in connection with public events,  Facebook said in a statement on Monday. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees certain rights including freedom of speech. William Miller, a spokesman for U.S. prosecutors, declined to comment. Facebook decided to challenge the gag order around the three warrants because free speech was at stake and because the events underlying the government's investigation were generally known to the public already, Facebook said in the undated court document. The precise nature of the government's investigation is not known. One document in the case said the timing of proceedings coincides with charges against people who protested President Donald Trump's inauguration in January. More than 200 people were arrested in Washington the day Trump was sworn in. Masked activists threw rocks at police, and multiple vehicles were set on fire. Tech firms comply with thousands of requests for user data annually made by governments around the world, but in extraordinary circumstances, companies such as Microsoft Corp and Twitter Inc have challenged government secrecy orders. Facebook recently fought a secrecy order related to a disability fraud investigation, losing in April in New York state's highest court. Companies and privacy advocates argue that gag orders rely on outdated laws and are applied too often, sometimes indefinitely, to bar them from notifying customers about government requests for their private online data. Facebook says about half of U.S. requests are accompanied by a non-disclosure order prohibiting it from notifying affected users. In April, a local judge in Washington denied Facebook's request to remove the gag order there, according to the document. Facebook is appealing and has preserved the relevant records pending the outcome, the document said.  The government can only insulate its actions from public scrutiny in this way in the rarest circumstances, which likely do not apply here,  said Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that advocates for digital rights. Facebook is getting support in court papers from several organizations including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union, as well as eight tech companies such as Microsoft and Apple Inc. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which is the highest court in Washington for local matters, is scheduled to hear the case in September, according to an order obtained by BuzzFeed News, which first reported Facebook's challenge to the gag order on Monday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/facebook-court-idUSL1N1JU1HC"},

(Reuters) - A Florida state court judge ruled on Monday that recent changes to the state's  stand your ground  law are unconstitutional, finding that legislators overstepped when making it easier for defendants to argue self-defense to obtain immunity for violent acts. Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Milton Hirsch said courts, not lawmakers, should set the process by which defendants can claim they were protecting themselves with an act of violence, according to the ruling posted online by the Miami Herald. The revision shifted the burden of proof during pretrial hearings to prosecutors, rather than defendants, to show whether force was used lawfully. Supporters saw the changes backed by the National Rifle Association, the powerful U.S. gun lobby, as bolstering civilians' rights to protect themselves. Advocates predicted the ruling would be reversed on appeal.  It is the role of the legislature to write the laws that govern how Floridians may exercise their statutory and constitutional rights,  Richard Corcoran, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said in a statement.  The Florida House will continue to stand with ordinary citizens who exercise their right to self-defense.  Florida's  stand your ground  law, passed in 2005, received wide scrutiny and inspired similar laws in other states. It removed the legal responsibility to retreat from a dangerous situation and allowed the use of deadly force when a person felt greatly threatened. This spring's changes were adopted over outcry that gun owners could be emboldened to shoot first. Critics cited the 2012 death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in the Orlando area, which spurred national protests and the Black Lives Matter movement. The neighborhood watchman who killed him, George Zimmerman, was acquitted of murder after the law was included in jury instructions. Monday's ruling in Miami circuit court is not binding on other state trial courts, the Miami Herald reported.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/florida-guns-idUSL1N1JU1HB"},

The move, which threatens to scuttle EQT's plans to become the largest U.S. natural gas producer, is hedge fund Jana's latest foray into the energy sector. Jana pushed Oil States International Inc (OIS.N) to spin off Civeo Corp (CVEO.N) in 2014. Jana began buying shares in April, before the Rice deal was announced last month - a deal that caught Jana by surprise, according to a source familiar with the matter. Since amassing its stake, Jana has become EQT's fourth-largest shareholder. Jana said in regulatory filings that instead of buying Rice, the company should separate all of its pipeline operations into a publicly traded company and change its board structure. Jana believes EQT would thrive if it focused solely on exploration and production, and believes the Rice deal's delay and tax structure pose problems, according to the source. The hedge fund has lined up two potential nominees for EQT's board and could nominate them and others, according to regulatory filings. The potential nominees are Daniel Herz and Edward Cohen, executive chairman and president, respectively, of natural gas producer and investor Atlas Energy Group LLC (ATLS.PK).  EQT acknowledged on Monday that its parts could be worth more if the company were broken apart and said its managers would study options and create a plan by the end of next year.  EQT seeks to maintain an open dialogue with investors and respects their opinions and perspectives,  EQT spokeswoman Natalie Cox said in a statement.  EQT's shares gained 1.2 percent to close Monday at $59.75, while shares of Rice Energy fell 3.6 percent to close at $25.66. The Rice deal, EQT's biggest, comes as U.S. natural gas prices NGc1 have been suppressed by abundant supply, forcing companies to seek ways to control production costs. EQT said it has identified $2.5 billion in cost savings as well as benefits from moving some of Rice's midstream assets into its own pipeline business, EQT Midstream Partners (EQM.N). Not all of EQT's pipeline operations are controlled by EQT Midstream Partners. EQT would face a higher tax burden if it bought Rice and moves Rice's pipeline assets into EQT Midstream Partners rather than if it just hived off all of its pipeline assets and focused on production. Such a step would likely be much quicker than buying Rice.  Jana returned 1.2 percent in June and is now up 5.8 percent for the first six months of 2017. Based on EQT's Friday closing price, Jana's stake is worth about $590 million. Rice did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal reported Jana's plans earlier on Monday.

John Lenzie Creech, 44, was convicted by a Los Angeles Superior Court jury after a two-week trial. The jurors had begun deliberating on Friday afternoon. Prosecutors said during the trial that Creech attacked and beat Gavin Smith, 57, after finding his estranged wife in a car with the film distribution executive at 20th Century Fox.  A Los Angeles County public defender who represented Creech at trial, Irene Nunez, could not immediately be reached for comment following the verdict.  Local KNBC-TV reported that Nunez argued at trial that Smith had died during a violent,  tragic  fight between the two men and that there had been no intent on her client's part to kill.  Smith, also known for playing on UCLA's 1975 national championship basketball team under celebrated coach John Wooden, was reported missing on May 1, 2012, prompting police to issue a missing persons bulletin and launch an exhaustive search.  The film studio issued a statement expressing concern about his disappearance, while family members posted a $20,000 reward, saying the 6-foot-6-inch (1.98-metre) ex-athlete with  movie star  looks should be easy to spot. His son Evan Smith, then a forward for the University of Southern California basketball team, tweeted messages such as  I will not stop until I find my father.  Smith's black Mercedes-Benz was found in February 2013 at a storage facility in the Los Angeles suburb of Simi Valley. In October 2014, hikers stumbled across a skull and other bones belonging to the missing studio executive in a shallow grave in the Angeles National Forest, 40 miles (64 km) east of Los Angeles. Creech, who was serving an eight-year prison term for sale of a controlled substance when he was arrested in connection with Smith's death, faces a maximum of 11 years behind bars for his conviction on the voluntary manslaughter charge.

Half of all suicide deaths in the U.S. are due to firearms. How many could be prevented by limiting firearm access for substance abusers, people with a mental health condition and people with a history of suicide attempts?  “Few,” Jennifer Boggs of Kaiser Permanente Colorado in Denver and her colleagues write in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The researchers reviewed the medical records of 2,674 adults and teenagers who died by suicide between 2000 and 2013 and had been patients of a network of health care systems participating in a suicide risk identification study. A bit more than half, 55 percent, had a mental health or substance abuse problem and about 43 percent of those committed suicide with a firearm.  Only 11 percent had previously attempted suicide, of whom a little more than a third, committed suicide with a firearm. Overall, 671 people with no mental health or substance abuse condition committed suicide by firearm during the study period compared with 627 who had one or both diagnoses.  Only 109 who previously attempted suicide used a firearm to kill themselves compared with 1,189 who did not. Put another way, only about a quarter of individuals with a known mental health or substance abuse problem committed suicide by firearm, as did just 4 percent of those who had previously attempted suicide. Based on the findings, the authors suggest that suicide prevention efforts expand beyond firearms to include people who may be thinking of using other means of suicide. “To truly make a difference in reducing suicide rates, we need to find and help more of the people who are at risk,” Boggs told Reuters Health by email.  “Most people who die by firearm suicide haven’t sought or received care for a mental health or substance abuse condition and therefore are unlikely to be identified in advance,” she adds. Dr. Paul Appelbaum of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City told Reuters Health that all health professionals should be aware of suicidal thinking in their patients, ask about access to firearms and advise families to remove guns from the home. That said, many suicidal people aren’t in contact with the medical system. “Even when they are, suicide is difficult to predict,” he said by email. “Unless the overall prevalence of firearms in our society is reduced,” said Appelbaum, who was not involved in the study, “it will be difficult to prevent the use of guns in suicides.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/2fazTFW Annals of Internal Medicine, online July 3, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-firearms-suicide-detection-idUSKBN19O2IF"},

In recent years, Moscow has cut off gas shipments during pricing disputes with neighboring countries in winter months. Exports from the United States would help reduce their dependence on Russia. Trump will tell the group that Washington wants to help allies by making it as easy as possible for U.S. companies to ship more liquefied natural gas (LNG) to central and eastern Europe, the White House said. Trump will attend the  Three Seas  summit - so named because several of its members surround the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas - before the Group of 20 leading economies meet in Germany, where he is slated to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time. Among the aims of the Three Seas project is to expand regional energy infrastructure, including LNG import terminals and gas pipelines. Members of the initiative include Poland, Austria, Hungary and Russia's neighbors Latvia and Estonia.  Trump's presence will give the project a lift, said James Jones, a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander. Increased U.S. gas exports to the region would help weaken the impact of Russia using energy as a weapon or bargaining chip, said Jones.       I think the United States can show itself as a benevolent country by exporting energy and by helping countries that don’t have adequate supplies become more self-sufficient and less dependent and less threatened,  he said. Trump's Russia policy is still taking shape, a process made awkward by investigations into intelligence findings that Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Russia denies the allegations and Trump says his team did not collude with Moscow.  Lawmakers in Trump's Republican Party, many of whom want to see him take a hard line on Russia because of its interference in the election and in crises in Ukraine and Syria, support using gas exports for political leverage.  It undermines the strategies of Putin and other strong men who are trying to use the light switch as an element of strategic offense,  said Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado who is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Kremlin relies on oil and gas revenue to finance the state budget, so taking market share would hurt Moscow.  In many ways, the LNG exports by the U.S. is the most threatening U.S. policy to Russia,  said Michal Baranowski, director of the Warsaw office of think-tank the German Marshall Fund.

Picture taken July 23, 2014.Filip Klimaszewski/File PhotoCompetitive Arena The U.S. is expected to become the world's third-largest exporter of LNG in 2020, just four years after starting up its first export terminal. U.S. exporters have sold most of that gas in long-term contracts, but there are still some volumes on offer, and more export projects on the drawing board. Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.A), which opened the first U.S. LNG export terminal in 2016, delivered its first cargo to Poland in June. Five more terminals are expected to be online by 2020. Tellurian Inc (TELL.O) has proposed a project with a price tag of as much as $16 billion that it hopes to complete by 2022, in time to compete for long-term contracts to supply Poland that expire the same year and are held by Russian gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM).  We would like to be a supplier that competes for that market,  Tellurian Chief Executive Meg Gentle told Reuters. A global glut in supply may, however, limit U.S. LNG export growth, regardless of Trump's support. The glut has depressed prices and made it difficult for LNG exporters to turn a profit, said Adam Sieminski, an energy analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Russia has the advantage in Europe due to its proximity and pipeline connections.  Europe is going to be the great competitive arena between Russian gas and LNG,  said Daniel Yergin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian and vice-chairman with IHS Markit analysis firm. Nord Stream Europeans will be watching to see whether Trump clarifies his administration's position on a new pipeline to pump Russian gas to Germany, known as Nord Stream 2. The U.S. Senate in June passed a package of sanctions on Russia, including provisions to penalize Western firms involved in the pipeline. The new sanctions have stalled in the House of Representatives. The U.S. State Department has lobbied against the pipeline as a potential supply chokepoint that would make Europe more vulnerable to disruptions.

On a fern-lined catwalk dotted with wooden lions and giraffes, designer Maria Grazia Chiuri presented the brand's Autumn-Winter 2017/18 haute couture collection, revisiting the  iconic  Bar  Jacket and gray skirt suits with a 1950s feel.  Christian Dior traveled across the world since 1947. This time we made the five continents come to Paris,  Dior CEO and Chairman Sidney Toledano told Reuters after the show. Christian Dior is one of the world's biggest and most famous fashion brands, worn by film legends from Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor to more recent stars such as Jennifer Lawrence, Natalie Portman and singer Rihanna. Chiuri was named as its first female creative director in July 2016 as Dior sought to connect with younger consumers and boost sales hit by the global luxury spending downturn and growing appetite for smaller and more local brands. Monday's show presented her second Haute Couture collection for Dior, which she joined from Valentino. Toledano said his new creative director had attracted and younger clients from Asia, where demand for luxury goods is picking up, while retaining existing customers.

Toledano said sales growth at Christian Dior Haute Couture and Maison Christian Dior as a whole was in the double-digits in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. To celebrate its 70th anniversary, Christian Dior is also taking over Les Arts Decoratifs museum in Paris for a lavish retrospective from July 5 to Jan. 7, featuring over 300 dresses from the house founder and the six designers who succeeded him. Christian Dior himself died in 1957, and the fashion house has since been headed by famous names including Yves Saint Laurent and John Galliano.  With nearly 200 stores in over 60 countries, Dior had 2016 sales of 1.94 billion euros. Its operating margin rose to 13.1 percent in 2016 from 12.8 pct in 2015.

Justice Edson Fachin's decision upholds a lower court's ruling that JBS' deal to sell plants in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay could harm the investigation of a massive corruption scandal involving JBS. Fachin's final decision was made on Friday, although the full ruling has yet to be released. JBS said in an emailed statement it would appeal the matter to the full Supreme Court. Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot reached a plea agreement in May with the billionaire brothers who control JBS, Wesley and Joesley Batista, to avoid prosecution if they turned in 1,893 politicians allegedly involved in a bribery scheme. Their testimony led to last week's corruption charge against President Michel Temer. The charge against Temer, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, added to the political turmoil in Latin America's biggest economy and threatens to halt the president's economic reform agenda in Congress. JBS lawyers had argued before Fachin that blocking the sale of assets to Minerva broke the terms of the plea-bargains the Batista signed, which gave them immunity against prosecution.

John Lenzie Creech, 44, was convicted by a Los Angeles Superior Court jury after a two-week trial. The jurors had begun deliberating on Friday afternoon. Prosecutors said during the trial that Creech attacked and beat Gavin Smith, 57, after finding his estranged wife in a car with the film distribution executive at 20th Century Fox.  A Los Angeles County public defender who represented Creech at trial, Irene Nunez, could not immediately be reached for comment following the verdict.  Local KNBC-TV reported that Nunez argued at trial that Smith had died during a violent,  tragic  fight between the two men and that there had been no intent on her client's part to kill.  Smith, also known for playing on UCLA's 1975 national championship basketball team under celebrated coach John Wooden, was reported missing on May 1, 2012, prompting police to issue a missing persons bulletin and launch an exhaustive search.  The film studio issued a statement expressing concern about his disappearance, while family members posted a $20,000 reward, saying the 6-foot-6-inch (1.98-metre) ex-athlete with  movie star  looks should be easy to spot. His son Evan Smith, then a forward for the University of Southern California basketball team, tweeted messages such as  I will not stop until I find my father.  Smith's black Mercedes-Benz was found in February 2013 at a storage facility in the Los Angeles suburb of Simi Valley. In October 2014, hikers stumbled across a skull and other bones belonging to the missing studio executive in a shallow grave in the Angeles National Forest, 40 miles (64 km) east of Los Angeles. Creech, who was serving an eight-year prison term for sale of a controlled substance when he was arrested in connection with Smith's death, faces a maximum of 11 years behind bars for his conviction on the voluntary manslaughter charge.

Facebook said it wants to notify three users about the search warrants seeking their communications and information and also give those users an opportunity to object to the warrants, according to a filing in a Washington, D.C., appeals court seen by Reuters.  We believe there are important First Amendment concerns with this case, including the government's refusal to let us notify three people of broad requests for their account information in connection with public events,  Facebook said in a statement on Monday.  The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees certain rights including freedom of speech.  William Miller, a spokesman for U.S. prosecutors, declined to comment.  Facebook decided to challenge the gag order around the three warrants because free speech was at stake and because the events underlying the government's investigation were generally known to the public already, Facebook said in the undated court document.  The precise nature of the government's investigation is not known. One document in the case said the timing of proceedings coincides with charges against people who protested President Donald Trump's inauguration in January.  More than 200 people were arrested in Washington the day Trump was sworn in. Masked activists threw rocks at police, and multiple vehicles were set on fire.  Tech firms comply with thousands of requests for user data annually made by governments around the world, but in extraordinary circumstances, companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) have challenged government secrecy orders.  Facebook recently fought a secrecy order related to a disability fraud investigation, losing in April in New York state's highest court. Companies and privacy advocates argue that gag orders rely on outdated laws and are applied too often, sometimes indefinitely, to bar them from notifying customers about government requests for their private online data. Facebook says about half of U.S. requests are accompanied by a non-disclosure order prohibiting it from notifying affected users.  In April, a local judge in Washington denied Facebook's request to remove the gag order there, according to the document. Facebook is appealing and has preserved the relevant records pending the outcome, the document said.   The government can only insulate its actions from public scrutiny in this way in the rarest circumstances, which likely do not apply here,  said Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that advocates for digital rights.  Facebook is getting support in court papers from several organizations including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union, as well as eight tech companies such as Microsoft and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which is the highest court in Washington for local matters, is scheduled to hear the case in September, according to an order obtained by BuzzFeed News, which first reported Facebook's challenge to the gag order on Monday.

(Reuters) - A Florida state court judge ruled on Monday that recent changes to the state's  stand your ground  law are unconstitutional, finding that legislators overstepped when making it easier for defendants to argue self-defense to obtain immunity for violent acts. Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Milton Hirsch said courts, not lawmakers, should set the process by which defendants can claim they were protecting themselves with an act of violence, according to the ruling posted online by the Miami Herald. The revision shifted the burden of proof during pretrial hearings to prosecutors, rather than defendants, to show whether force was used lawfully. Supporters saw the changes backed by the National Rifle Association, the powerful U.S. gun lobby, as bolstering civilians' rights to protect themselves. Advocates predicted the ruling would be reversed on appeal.  It is the role of the legislature to write the laws that govern how Floridians may exercise their statutory and constitutional rights,  Richard Corcoran, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said in a statement.  The Florida House will continue to stand with ordinary citizens who exercise their right to self-defense.  Florida's  stand your ground  law, passed in 2005, received wide scrutiny and inspired similar laws in other states. It removed the legal responsibility to retreat from a dangerous situation and allowed the use of deadly force when a person felt greatly threatened. This spring's changes were adopted over outcry that gun owners could be emboldened to shoot first. Critics cited the 2012 death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in the Orlando area, which spurred national protests and the Black Lives Matter movement. The neighborhood watchman who killed him, George Zimmerman, was acquitted of murder after the law was included in jury instructions.

Hammond and Prime Minister Theresa May are under pressure to loosen the seven year-old cap which limits public sector pay increases to 1 percent a year at a time when inflation is about to hit 3 percent soon. Hammond said in a speech to business leaders that he recognized public weariness with the push to fix Britain's public finances, but he signaled no immediate change of course.  Our policy on public sector pay has always been designed to strike the right balance of between being fair to our public servants, and fair to those who pay for them,  Hammond said.  That approach has not changed; and we continually assess that balance.  Earlier on Monday, a spokesman for May said the government would respond to recommendations on pay increases for teachers, police and some other public sector workers later this year. In his speech to the Confederation of British Industry, Hammond said he would stick to his plan to eradicate Britain's budget deficit by 2025. He also repeated calls for a Brexit deal that ensured a transition period to allow British companies to adapt to Britain's new relationship with the European Union and one which allowed companies to recruit the workers they need.

Starting Tuesday, Curve will offer customers the chance to  go back in time  and switch the card used for any given transaction for up to two weeks after the purchase, in what it said would be a world first.  The startup also said on Monday that it was planning to announce backing from two large international banks soon, but declined to provide more detailed information.     Curve, which has a patent pending for the new tool, provides customers one card that can aggregate all of their existing Mastercard and Visa Inc (V.N)  payment cards. Users can carry only the Curve card and switch between the cards they want to use for a purchase through a mobile phone app.  Founded in 2015, the startup is among a growing group of young companies that seek to make better use of digital technologies to make payments and banking products more user-friendly. The startup's chief executive, Shachar Bialick, said the new  time travel  functionality will give customers more time to chose the most convenient form of payment for a given transaction.  For example, users might have funds available in their current account days after a purchase paid for with a credit card - and would therefore prefer to switch the transaction to a debit card to avoid interest fees.   The user can manage their cash flow much better,  Bialick said.  It's very hard to make the decision at the point of sale.  The functionality would also enable users to take better advantage of card rewards, he said. While users would be able to switch cards, the change would happen within Curve's platform, so merchants would only see the original transaction and would not be charged card processing fees twice.  Rewards gained through the first purchase will be reversed if that card is changed, Curve said.    Curve, which is still in  beta  testing mode, has already had more than 50,000 sign-ups, with the cards having been used for over 50 million pounds ($64.7 million) in transactions so far.

The sixth seed beat two grand slam champions in a day on the grass at last week's rain-interrupted Eastbourne tournament, so came in brimming with form, but had been an injury scare after a heavy fall forced her to withdraw from her semi-final. But she appeared to be moving well in front of a cheering Court One crowd and told reporters she felt  absolutely fine .  I was really just trying to stay as focused on what I was trying to do out there, and not necessarily get caught up in her web,  the 26-year-old said of Hsieh, who had beaten her in three sets on the Paris clay. With the women's field wide open in the absence of pregnant 2016 champion and 23-times grand slam winner Serena Williams, Konta is among the women being tipped for a run at the title -- 40 years after Briton Virginia Wade lifted the trophy in 1977.

In the first five months of the year, diesel imports hit 4.44 billion liters, ANP said on Friday, while domestic diesel sales fell 2 percent in the same period to 21.6 billion liters, in a sign of a weak economy. The surge in diesel imports likely reflects Petroleo Brasileiro SA's slipping diesel market share, as other distributors take advantage of a drop in international prices to lower fuel costs in Brazil, undercutting the state-controlled company. In a presentation on Friday, Petrobras executives pointed to strong growth in diesel imports by domestic market rivals, in part to explain their decision to adjust fuel prices more often to hue more closely to international markets. According to Petrobras data, imports by third parties are expected to have risen 25 percent in June to 1.2 billion liters. In May alone, imports rose 20.8 percent to 803.5 million liters, while diesel sales rose only 2.5 percent to 4.6 billion liters, when compared with the same period last year. In the case of gasoline-A, or gasoline without ethanol added, imports in the first five months of the year rose 120.7 percent compared with the same period in 2016 to 2.25 billion liters, its highest since 2013. Meanwhile, sales at gas stations of gasoline-C, which contains anhydrous ethanol, rose 6.5 percent in the first five months of the year to 18.649 billion liters.

The former World War Two airfield, which hosted the first Formula One world championship race in 1950, has a contract to 2026 with a break clause on both sides from 2019 that has to be exercised two years in advance. This year's British Grand Prix, a home race for triple world champion Lewis Hamilton, is on July 16 but Thursday, July 13, is the first day of off-track activities and a decision must be taken by then. The BRDC informed all members in a letter last December  that it was giving serious thought to exercising the break clause because of the  potentially ruinous risk  posed by hosting fees that increased annually. Media reports have indicated that Silverstone will have to pay nearly 17 million pounds ($22.00 million) to host the race this year, rising to 26 million by the end of the contract. Exercising the clause would allow a new contract to be negotiated. The circuit drew 139,000 people on race day last season, although less than 100,000 were paying spectators. Formula One's new owners Liberty Media have said they want to safeguard the sport's historic venues, but they are also wary of actions that might encourage other circuits to seek more favorable deals.

Fintech firms in Brazil have been growing fast in sectors such as consumer lending and credit cards, seeking to undercut some of the highest interest rates in the world offered by traditional banks.  Now fintechs such as Banco Inter are diversifying to offer accounts for small companies run by their existing retail clients.  Banco Inter and other fintechs are expanding into  bridging loans  for small businesses borrowing against their receivables from supply contracts with major companies, offering lower rates than traditional banks.  Borrowers in Latin America's biggest country pay an average 250 percent a year for the riskiest type of unsecured rollover credit, the highest among the world's 20 major economies.   There's a lot of room to grow because banks still charge very high rates and availability of credit for small- and mid-sized enterprises remains restricted,  said Jorge Vargas Neto, founding partner of Biva, a fintech that has originated 30 million reais ($9.1 million) in loans since 2015. Lacking the necessary capital and scale to grow in a segment where assessing credit risk can be tricky, fintechs like Biva are using  peer to peer  models - connecting individuals and small enterprises to borrow and lend money without a financial institution.  Biva offers rates of between 1.7 percent and 6.3 percent a month to borrowers, and average returns of 22 percent a year to investors, Vargas said. No Regulation  Employees of Brazilian financial technology firm Geru work in the company's headquarters in Sao Paulo, Brazil, July 3, 2017.Leonardo BenassattoBrazil has yet to regulate peer-to-peer lenders, although activity has grown considerably in the past two years. The central bank said in May that it was looking to implement regulations this year to oversee fintech firms.  The slow progress in designing a framework underscores fintechs' concern not to circumvent or breach existing banking laws. Fintechs are trying different systems through which their investors can fund lending to smaller firms, including systems similar to a Dutch auction - in which borrowers get incentives to present as many guarantees as possible to get the lowest interest rate.     Employees of Brazilian financial technology firm Geru work in the company's headquarters in Sao Paulo, Brazil, July 3, 2017.Leonardo Benassatto This is a means to try to overcome the inefficiency of the credit system in Brazil, which is most accentuated for small- and medium-sized companies,  said Dan Cohen, founder and partner at F(x), which uses algorithms to match the profiles of lenders and borrowers. The move comes as traditional banks have cut credit access for smaller companies amid record defaults and bankruptcies during Brazil's deepest recession on record.  State-controlled Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3.SA) curbed lending in the segment by almost 30 percent in the 12 months through March, while disbursements at Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4.SA) for the segment were down almost 10 percent in the same period. Itaú is Brazil's No. 1 bank by assets. According to a study released in May by the InterAmerican Development Bank and tech accelerator Finnovista, Brazil is home to 230 of the 703 fintechs in Latin America, ranging from digital banks to financial education companies. Many Brazilian financial startups involved in lending say that demand is coming from small businessmen. Brazilian fintech Geru lends on average up to 50,000 reais per client to individuals to invest in their own small businesses.  We have seen that a large number of our loans go to self-employed people to invest in their own companies,  said Geru's founder, Sandro Reiss.

Carige, the country's ninth-biggest bank, has been told by European supervisors to shed bad debts and shore up its core capital, which does not meet the regulator's minimum requirements. Restructuring at the regional lender was delayed earlier this year by a row over how to fix the bank's problems that led the bank's top investor, a local businessman, to squeeze out the former chief executive. In a statement on Monday, Carige said it aimed to complete its capital increase by the end of the year after selling the bad loan portfolio and disposing of assets worth at least 200 million euros. The cash call is guaranteed by Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank in their roles as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners, it said. Carige's move comes days after Italy started to wind up two failed banks in the Veneto region in a deal that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros. Rome is also waiting for a final green light to pump 6.6 billion euros of state money into Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena to help keep the troubled lender in business. Italian banks are struggling with bad debts that stood at some 350 billion euros at the end of last year and are striving to shift them off their balance sheets to boost profitability. Carige, heavily exposed to the northwestern Liguria region where it is based, has lost nearly 2 billion euros in the past four years because of big loan writedowns and slumping revenues. But with assets of 26 billion euros and a capital gap of 600 million euros, Carige is expected to be much less of a headache than the two Veneto-based banks. Carige's capital increase, its third cash call since 2014, had originally been penciled in for this summer but the removal of former CEO Guido Bastianini and his replacement by former UniCredit executive Paolo Fiorentino has cost time. The bank said it had appointed Andrea Soro as its new Chief Financial Officer.

Ty Cobb, a white-collar defense lawyer with the firm of Hogan Lovells and a former federal prosecutor, met with Trump about a week ago, another person said. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the administration had  no announcement at this time.   Cobb did not respond to requests for comment except to say he was on vacation. Cobb, 66, represented a number of individuals in government investigations during the Clinton administration, including former Democratic National Committee fundraiser John Huang and former White House aide David Watkins. Trump has been seeking a senior-level lawyer to join the office led by White House Counsel Don McGahn to focus on the various Russia investigations, one of the people said. In addition to a probe by special counsel Robert Mueller, several congressional panels are investigating Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential collusion by Trump's campaign. Moscow has denied any interference and Trump has denied any collusion. The role Cobb met with Trump about is separate from the legal team gathering to represent the president personally. That team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, now includes constitutional lawyer and evangelical radio talk show host Jay Sekulow, Washington lawyer John Dowd, and Michael Bowe, a partner at Kasowitz’s firm. According to sources familiar with the matter, lawyers from major firms have turned down joining Trump's outside legal team, citing conflicts at their firms and concerns Trump would not listen to them.   Others lawyers have also turned down the role for which Cobb is being considered. William Burck, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, and Emmet Flood, a partner at Williams & Connolly, both turned down the opportunity, according to people familiar with the matter. Cobb, a distant relative of the famous baseball player of the same name, graduated from Harvard University and earned his law degree at Georgetown. In the 1980s, he was a federal prosecutor in Baltimore, where he led a regional drug and organized crime task force.  Cobb has some experience with leaks, which Trump has repeatedly complained about in relation to the Russia probes. In 2006, Cobb represented former CIA official Mary McCarthy, who was fired after she was accused of providing classified information to reporters. No charges were brought against McCarthy.

But her involvement in a fatal motor accident, which led to  the death of a 78-year-old Florida man, has left her understandably in an emotional state - generating support from others in the game and also concern over whether it will hurt her bid for a sixth title. After winning her first-round match against Belgian Elise Mertens in straight sets, the 37-year-old Williams broke down in tears during a press conference when asked about how she was coping with the incident.  There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and ... yeah. I'm completely speechless,  Williams said before leaving the room. Last week, Palm Beach Gardens police released a preliminary report saying she was the driver at fault in a June 9 accident that injured Jerome Barson, a passenger in the other car. Barson was taken to a Florida trauma center where he died 13 days later, according to the Palm Beach county medical examiner. Petra Kvitova, two-time Wimbledon winner and one of the favorites again this year, said she was sure that it was tough for Venus to focus on her game.  I think it's difficult, especially in her position. I mean, every traumatic situation is always tough. I feel like for women it's more difficult because we are more sensitive and more emotional than ... guys. So I feel like it's not easy,  she said. Kvitova recently had to cope with her own dramatic situation after she was knifed during an attempted robbery at her home in the Czech Republic in December.

She acknowledged the differences with the Williams situation, but she said she understood it can be difficult to focus.  I mean, you still want to be focused on each point that you are playing, but sometimes you just get upset with something else. It's just difficult to switch for the tennis again.  I know that she doesn't really have a good time right now, but I wish her all the best,  she said.

It's obviously horrible. I think, unless you've been through it, you don't know. You don't know what to do,  he said. How much of an impact the situation will have on Williams' performances remains to be seen, but former world number one Mats Wilander says it is a possible factor.  I have no idea what she must be feeling on the inside,  Wilander said of Williams.   I had been thinking she might have a chance of winning this, but now I am not sure ... you could see when she was playing that she has the whole world on her shoulders.

Williams, who won her first-round match against Belgian Elise Mertens in straight sets, was asked about her feelings regarding the incident.  There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and...yeah. I'm completely speechless. It's just - yeah, I mean, I'm just,  said the American before breaking down in tears and leaving the room. The five-times Wimbledon champion returned shortly afterwards to finish off the compulsory media briefing. News of the fatal incident near her home in Palm Beach Gardens surfaced on Thursday. Related CoverageEmotional Venus generates support and concernPalm Beach Gardens police released a preliminary report saying she was the driver at fault in a June 9 accident that left Jerome Barson, a passenger in the other car, with fatal injuries. After the crash, Barson was taken to a Florida trauma center where he died 13 days later, according to the Palm Beach county medical examiner. The police report estimated Williams was traveling at about 5 miles per hour (8 kph) at the time of impact and was not distracted or suspected of any drug or alcohol use. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 3, 2017   USA’s Venus Williams shakes hands with Belgium’s Elise Mertens after winning their first round matchToby MelvilleBefore breaking down in the news conference, Williams had been asked several questions about her emotions in the past month but had avoided directly addressing the matter.  Life, you can't prepare for everything. I prepared for a lot of matches, tried to get ready for whatever my opponent will throw at you, but you can't prepare for everything,  she said.  I have no idea what tomorrow will bring. That's all I can say about it. That's what I've learned,  she said to another question on how she was handling the situation. Slideshow (4 Images)Last week Williams released a statement on Facebook saying that she was  heartbroken  and   devastated  by the death of Barson. Williams also said she was missing her sister Serena who is on a break from the game while she is pregnant.  I miss her a lot. I think she misses me,  she said. The 37-year-old American faced a tenacious opponent as she began her bid for a sixth Wimbledon singles title with a 7-6(7) 6-4 victory. While a nervous Mertens struggled early, going 3-0 down in the first set, the 21-year-old, ranked 54th in the world, battled back to force a tiebreak which Williams won 9-7. Williams, who last won Wimbledon in 2008, was unable to convert two match points in the second set before a rain break, but she returned to serve out for victory.

From 2005 to 2015, if black infants had experienced the same mortality rate as white infants, thousands fewer babies would have died, the researchers estimate.   The benefits to the black population have stalled and we have to pay attention to that,  said Corinne Riddell, of McGill University in Montreal. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this year that infant mortality declined 15 percent over the past decade. To see if non-Hispanic black infants benefited as much from the falling infant mortality rates as non-Hispanic white infants, Riddell and colleagues analyzed U.S. data collected from 2005 through 2015. Infant mortality rates are calculated as the number of deaths within the first year of life relative to the number of live births. From 2005 to 2015, the mortality rate among white infants declined from 5.7 deaths per 1,000 births to 4.8 per 1,000 births, Riddell's team reports in JAMA Pediatrics. Among black infants, the death rate declined from 14.3 per 1,000 births in 2005 to 11.6 per 1,000 in 2012, where it plateaued before going back up to 11.7 per 1,000 births in 2015. For every thousand births, there were 8.6 more infant deaths among blacks than among whites in 2005. The difference fell to 6.6 extra deaths in black infants in 2012 but rose again to 6.9 extra deaths in 2015. When the researchers looked at causes of death, they found that deaths due to preterm birth and low birthweight among black infants followed a similar pattern as the mortality rate - a decrease and plateau. That might be where public health efforts should be directed,  to target the disparity,  Riddell told Reuters Health. Riddell's team hopes to examine infant mortality rates by region to see if some states are doing better than others in addressing the disparity. States with larger racial gaps in infant mortality rates could possibly learn from policies in states with smaller disparities, she said.

Every summer, some of Wall Street's biggest wealth management firms organize events catering to future heirs of their ultra-wealthy clients, hoping they can teach them a thing or two about money, and plant the seeds for what banks hope will be fruitful business relationships down the line. Wealth managers see a big opportunity in the millennial generation, those born between 1980 and 2000, who are expected to inherit an estimated $30 trillion from their Baby Boomer parents over the next 30 years, on top of their own earnings. The millennials already control nearly $17 trillion, or 10 percent, of the world's wealth, and that figure is expected to rise to $35.3 trillion, or 16 percent, by 2020, according to the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). But capturing millennials' attention has been difficult for wealth managers like Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and UBS Group AG (UBSG.S), because of cultural differences between generations and competition from digital startups called roboadvisers. Of the assets under management at private banks, only about 6 percent belong to millennials, according to BCG. Conferences like the one held by Morgan Stanley are an attempt to get young adults to warm up to Wall Street wealth managers. Held a block away from the bank's midtown Manhattan headquarters, there were about 50 guests, aged 18 to 35, whose parents are Private Wealth Management clients. That business caters to those who invest at least $20 million with the bank. In addition to  Time for a prenup? , other popular panels included  Show Me the Money! Investing 101  and  Communicate Like a Leader.  Citi's private bank has been holding similar events on three continents this year, including one in Silicon Valley last month. It was for clients' children who have been identified as the successors to family businesses, and it focused on how to use major innovations in technology, like artificial intelligence, to grow the bottom line.  If anyone thinks that just by organizing a boot camp that you can earn (clients' kids) trust, you're fooling yourself,  said Money Kanagasabapathy, who goes by the name Money K and is the global head of next generation programs for Citi Private Bank.  You have to really inspire them and hope that they at least continue having the conversation with you.  Darya Pishevar, whose father, Shervin Pishevar, is a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, attended the Morgan Stanley event last week. Though she is still in high school, Pishevar said she was interested in the sessions on leadership and impact investing because her family may create a foundation. Across the room, 28-year-old medical researcher Emilia Javorsky said she wanted advice on launching a medical device business. While she was not sure she would use Morgan Stanley in her business dealings, she said the conference made her feel good about the bank.  It made them feel more accessible,  Javorsky said.  When you don't come from a financial services background, it can be daunting. This made it less daunting.

Brendt Christensen, 28, was arrested by FBI agents in Champaign, Illinois, on Friday on charges of kidnapping in the disappearance of Yingying Zhang, 26, on June 9, according to University of Illinois Police. Authorities believe she is no longer alive. The U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement that agents overheard Christensen while he was under surveillance  explaining  how he kidnapped Zhang. A search of his cell phone found he had visited a website that included threads on  Perfect abduction fantasy  and  planning a kidnapping,  according to the criminal complaint. Audio captured after nearly two weeks of surveillance includes Christensen stating that he had brought the victim back to his apartment and held her against her will, the complaint said. It did not specify to whom he said that. On June 9, Zhang went to sign a lease for an apartment in Urbana, but missed a connecting mass transit bus, according to an affidavit. As she waited for the next bus, a motorist in a black Saturn Astra pulled up and she got in the vehicle.      Christensen's appearance Monday in U.S. District Court in Urbana drew crowds of supporters, including some holding signs reading  We are with you Yingying.  Crowds also marched in support last week during the search for Zhang, a scholar in photosynthesis and crop productivity who came to study at the University of Illinois two months ago. Photos show Christensen was present at the rally, university officials confirmed on Monday.

There's a lot that the public doesn't know.  If convicted, Christensen could face life in prison. The federal court clerk's office said a detention hearing will be held on Wednesday and a preliminary hearing was set for July 14.  Christensen at first said he could not recall his whereabouts on June 9, the day of Zhang's disappearance, according to the criminal complaint. Days later, Christensen told the FBI he offered an apparently distressed Asian female a ride, but dropped her off a few blocks later after she became panicked, possibly believing they had taken a wrong turn. A search of his car showed the front passenger door appeared to have been cleaned more diligently than other doors, indicating a possible attempt to conceal evidence, the complaint said. The case has rattled the Chinese community in the area. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign had more than 5,600 Chinese students enrolled as of last fall, according to university data. Her father and other family members traveled from China to Champaign to join in the search for Zhang. Christensen graduated with a master's degree in May, the university said.

The EPA on June 5 announced a stay in the rule, which would have required drillers and transporters to start reporting and fixing any methane leaks they found in wells and transfer stations, after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt wrote in an April 18 letter the agency intended to reconsider imposing it. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the agency did not have the authority to halt the rule during those deliberations.  The EPA's stay  is essentially an order delaying the rule's effective date, and this court has held that such orders are tantamount to amending or revoking a rule,  Judges David Tatel and Robert Wilkins wrote. The third member of the three-judge panel, Judge Janice Rogers Brown, dissented.   We are reviewing the opinion and examining our options,  an EPA spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters. The court's ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed June 5 by green groups that opposed the EPA's stay of the rule. The groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense Fund, Sierra Club and other environmental organizations, argued the EPA did not follow procedures detailed in the 1970 law known as the Clean Air Act when it froze the rule.  This is a big win for public health and a wake-up call for this administration,  said Tim Ballo, a staff attorney for the group Earthjustice, one of the groups participating in the case. David Doniger, director of the NRDC's Climate and Clean Air Program, said other courts could follow suit on pending challenges to Pruitt's suspensions of a slew of EPA rules, including those governing methane leakage from landfills and protections from chemical accidents and pesticides.  This is the first court to rule and the first to strike him down,  he said. Pruitt has vowed to make conditions more favorable for oil, gas and coal companies. In his April letter, he said he had begun examining a set of EPA regulations known as the Clean Power Plan following an executive order by Trump to  suspend, revise, or rescind  rules that  potentially burdened the development  of U.S. energy sources.

We studied and analysed our product for signs of hacking - it is not infected with a virus and everything is fine, it is safe,  said Olesya, managing partner at Intellect Service.  The update package, which was sent out long before the virus was spread, we checked it 100 times and everything is fine.   Little known outside Ukrainian accounting circles, M.E.Doc is an everyday part of life at around 80 percent of companies in Ukraine. The software allows its 400,000 clients to send and discuss financial documents between internal departments, as well as file them with the Ukrainian state tax service. Police Investigating Investigators have said M.E.Doc's expansive reach is what made it a prime target for the unknown hackers, who were looking for a way to infect as many victims as possible.  These malware families were spread using Ukrainian accounting software called M.E.Doc,  researchers at Slovakian security software firm ESET said in a blog post on Friday.  M.E.Doc has an internal messaging and document exchange system so attackers could send spearphishing messages to victims.  Ukrainian police said on Monday the Linniks could now face criminal charges if it is confirmed they knew about the infection but took no action.  We have issues with the company's leadership, because they knew there was a virus in their software but didn't do anything ... if this is confirmed, we will bring charges,  Serhiy Demedyuk, the head of Ukraine's cyber police, told Reuters in a text message.  Speaking before Demedyuk's comments at the company's modest offices on an industrial estate in Kiev, Sergei, Intellect Service's general director, raised his voice in frustration.   We built this business over 20 years. What is the point of us killing our own business?  Olesya said the company was cooperating with investigators and the police were yet to reach any conclusions.  The cyber police are currently bogged down in the investigation, we gave them the logs of all our servers and there are no traces that our servers spread this virus,  she said.  M.E.Doc is a transportation product, it delivers documents. But is an email program guilty in the distribution of a virus? Hardly.

Critics of the ECB's decision to buy sovereign bonds on the secondary market also argue that the program has reduced pressure on euro zone governments to implement reforms.

If we have more growth and if there is no threat of a deflation, then the ECB will -- it cannot do this fast because the problems in some countries in Europe are too big -- then it can slowly start to normalize monetary policy so that we can hopefully soon end this crazy situation of zero interest rates and negative interest rates,  he said. Schaeuble said that inflation in the euro zone was slowly picking up and that it was moving toward the ECB's price stability target of just under 2 percent. This development would help ECB policymakers find a case for normalization of their ultra-loose monetary policy, he added.

Automakers' shares rose, however, as retail sales to consumers were relatively stable at the U.S. automakers, with General Motors Co (GM.N) asserting that the industry was set for a stronger finish to the year.  Industry consultant Autodata put the industry's seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales at 16.51 million units, which was the lowest rate since February 2015. It came in below Wall Street expectations of 16.6 million vehicles and 2 percent lower than the June 2016 figure.  U.S. consumers continued to shun passenger cars in favor of larger pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers. Passenger car sales were also hurt as some automakers, including GM, have moved to reduce relatively low-margin sales to rental agencies. The U.S. auto industry has been bracing for a downturn after hitting a record 17.55 million new vehicles sold in 2016. A glut of nearly new used vehicles poses competition for new vehicle sales and automakers have relied increasingly on consumer discounts and loosened lending terms.  Car shopping website Edmunds said the average length of a car loan reached a record high of 69.3 months in June.  It's financially risky, leaving borrowers exposed to being upside down on their vehicles for a large chunk of their loans,  said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry analysis.  GM said its sales fell about 5 percent versus June 2016, but that the industry would see stronger sales in the second half of 2017 versus the first half.   U.S. total sales are moderating due to an industry-wide pullback in daily rental sales, but key U.S. economic fundamentals clearly remain positive,  said GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem.  Under the current economic conditions, we anticipate U.S. retail vehicle sales will remain strong for the foreseeable future.  FILE PHOTO - Cars are seen in a parking lot in Palm Springs, California, U.S. on April 13, 2015.Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoFord Motor Co (F.N) said its June sales were hit by lower fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government entities, which fell 13.9 percent, while sales to consumers were flat. Wall Street analysts worry that the millions of low mileage, off-lease vehicles poised to hit the market between now and the end of 2019 will weigh on future new vehicle sales.  Ford vice president for U.S. marketing, sales and service Mark LaNeve said on a conference call that the automaker has seen little evidence that its competitors are reducing their reliance on leasing to clinch a sale.

Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said sales rose 2.1 percent versus June 2016 and said it saw strong gains in the RAV4, a light SUV, sales of which increased 24.7 percent. Sales of another SUV, the 4Runner, rose 16.6 percent.  But sales at Toyota's Lexus luxury car brand fell 5.4 percent on the year. Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) said its U.S. sales increased 2 percent.

Shares fell 2.5 percent in regular trade on Monday to $352.62 after the Model 3 comments and eased down a touch more in after hours trade, following the first-half report. Tesla said a  severe shortfall  of new battery packs had constrained vehicle manufacturing until June, and it forecast that second-half deliveries of the Model S sedan and Model X sports utility vehicle likely would exceed those of the first half. It had forecast first-half deliveries of 47,000 to 50,000. Most investors are focused on the outlook for the Model 3, and some analysts have been skeptical about its planned July launch after production delays and quality issues marred the launches of the Model S and Model X. Tesla's shares are up more than 60 percent this year, partly on expectations of a strong launch for its Model 3, the first car the company has aimed at the mass market. Tesla has a market value of $58 billion, greater than either General Motors Co or Ford Motor Co.    In a series of posts on Twitter late on Sunday, Musk said the Model 3 had passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule.

Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec.   That is in line with targets Tesla previously set, of more than 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of this year and 10,000 vehicles per week  at some point in 2018 . Tesla Motors' mass-market Model 3 electric cars are seen in this handout picture from Tesla Motors on March 31, 2016.   Tesla Motors/Handout via Reuters/File PhotoMusk said he expected SN1 - the first car off the assembly line for sale - to be completed on Friday. Tesla has taken deposits on more than 300,000 Model 3s, starting at $35,000 a vehicle. Its popularity stands out as major U.S. automakers face a downturn. GM and Ford both reported lower sales for June on Monday. The Model 3 marks a turning point for Tesla as it transitions from a niche luxury car manufacturer to a mass producer. The 500,000 vehicles the company plans to make next year is nearly six times its 2016 production.

Shares fell 2.5 percent in regular trade on Monday to $352.62 after the Model 3 comments and eased down a touch more in after hours trade, following the first-half report. Tesla said a  severe shortfall  of new battery packs had constrained vehicle manufacturing until June, and it forecast that second-half deliveries of the Model S sedan and Model X sports utility vehicle likely would exceed those of the first half. It had forecast first-half deliveries of 47,000 to 50,000. Most investors are focused on the outlook for the Model 3, and some analysts have been skeptical about its planned July launch after production delays and quality issues marred the launches of the Model S and Model X. Tesla's shares are up more than 60 percent this year, partly on expectations of a strong launch for its Model 3, the first car the company has aimed at the mass market. Tesla has a market value of $58 billion, greater than either General Motors Co or Ford Motor Co.    In a series of posts on Twitter late on Sunday, Musk said the Model 3 had passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule.

Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec.   That is in line with targets Tesla previously set, of more than 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of this year and 10,000 vehicles per week  at some point in 2018 .

Tesla has taken deposits on more than 300,000 Model 3s, starting at $35,000 a vehicle. Its popularity stands out as major U.S. automakers face a downturn. GM and Ford both reported lower sales for June on Monday. The Model 3 marks a turning point for Tesla as it transitions from a niche luxury car manufacturer to a mass producer. The 500,000 vehicles the company plans to make next year is nearly six times its 2016 production.

The German, four times world champion, had been given a 10-second stop-and-go penalty during the race for angrily banging wheels with his Mercedes rival while they were behind the safety car. He had risked a heavy fine, disqualification from the Baku results or even a race ban after the International Automobile Federation decided last week to review the causes of the incident. Vettel, who turned 30 on Monday, attended a meeting at the FIA's Paris headquarters with Ferrari team boss Maurizio Arrivabene. The driver admitted full responsibility, pledged to make a public apology and also  committed to devote personal time over the next 12 months to educational activities across a variety of FIA championships and events . The governing body said that  in light of these developments, FIA President Jean Todt decided that on this occasion the matter should be closed . He also instructed that Vettel should not endorse any road safety activities until the end of the year. 'Role Models' Todt, a former Ferrari boss, recognized that top-level sport was an intense environment where passions ran high and noted also that the Italian team were aligned with the values and objectives of the FIA.  However, it is the role of top sportsmen to deal with that pressure calmly and to conduct themselves in a manner that not only respects the regulations of the sport but which befits the elevated status they enjoy,  he said.  Sportsmen must be cognizant of the impact their behavior can have on those who look up to them. They are heroes and role models and to millions of fans worldwide and must conduct themselves accordingly.  Todt said any repetition of such behavior would lead to Vettel, who already has nine penalty points on his Formula One license and is just three away from a race ban, being immediately referred to the FIA's International Tribunal. The collision in Baku on June 25 divided opinion within the sport. The German ultimately finished fourth, a place ahead of Hamilton, and some commentators suggested he had got off lightly. Hamilton had led from pole and was keeping a distance to the safety car, which was about to return to the pits, when Vettel hit the rear of his Mercedes. The German, who accused his rival of 'brake testing' him by suddenly slowing, pulled alongside and waved his fists before banging wheels. The race was halted soon after. When it resumed, Hamilton had to pit to fix a loose headrest, losing what had looked like a nailed-on victory. Afterwards, the Briton called Vettel  a disgrace . Full Responsibility The FIA said Monday's meeting was attended by top officials including race director Charlie Whiting and safety director Laurent Mekies.  Following detailed discussion and further examination of video and data evidence related to the incident, Sebastian Vettel admitted full responsibility,  the FIA said. A formal apology was published on Vettel's personal website (www.sebastianvettel.de).  During the re-start lap, I got surprised by Lewis and ran into the back of his car. With hindsight, I don't believe he had any bad intentions,  he said.  In the heat of the action I then overreacted, and therefore I want to apologize to Lewis directly, as well as to all the people who were watching the race. I realize that I was not setting a good example.  I love this sport and I am determined to represent it in a way that can be an example for future generations.

On a fern-lined catwalk dotted with wooden lions and giraffes, designer Maria Grazia Chiuri presented the brand's Autumn-Winter 2017/18 haute couture collection, revisiting the  iconic  Bar  Jacket and gray skirt suits with a 1950s feel.  Christian Dior traveled across the world since 1947. This time we made the five continents come to Paris,  Dior CEO and Chairman Sidney Toledano told Reuters after the show. Christian Dior is one of the world's biggest and most famous fashion brands, worn by film legends from Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor to more recent stars such as Jennifer Lawrence, Natalie Portman and singer Rihanna. Chiuri was named as its first female creative director in July 2016 as Dior sought to connect with younger consumers and boost sales hit by the global luxury spending downturn and growing appetite for smaller and more local brands. Monday's show presented her second Haute Couture collection for Dior, which she joined from Valentino. Toledano said his new creative director had attracted and younger clients from Asia, where demand for luxury goods is picking up, while retaining existing customers.

After a review, EDF said the cost of completion had increased by 1.5 billion pounds to stand at 19.6 billion pounds ($25.5 billion) - an increase that means its predicted rate of return on investment will fall to 8.5 percent from 9 percent previously. The review, carried out after the final investment decision was made, looked into design and engineering plans, the amount of work that has to be carried out and further discussions with suppliers, EDF said. EDF also said there was a risk of delayed delivery of the project of 15 months for Unit 1 and nine months for Unit 2, which would add a further 700 million pounds to costs. The company said it was on track to meet its target of pouring first concrete for the reactor in mid-2019, with unit 1 set to be producing by 2025. The latest update should have no impact on power supply in Britain, nor should it affect Britain's electricity costs from the first new nuclear plant in decades which is slated to provide 7 percent of its power needs.  The UK government negotiated a competitive deal which protects consumers and ensures that all of the cost of construction, including any overruns, sits with the contractor,  a spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said in an email. EDF confirmed there would be no impact on that contract. Credit rating agency Moody's said the cost revision and the risk of slippage were credit negative for EDF and illustrated the financial risks of the project's long construction phase during which no cash flow is generated. The French government stepped in later on Monday, with Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire asking EDF to come up with a  rigorous  action plan by the end of July to ensure the review's financial impact remains as small as possible. EDF's announcement follows a report last week in Le Monde newspaper flagging likely cost overruns on Hinkley, although the project received a boost around the same time from news that a prototype being built in Flamanville, France, got the all-clear from safety regulators even though inspectors had found weak spots in its steel reactor cover. Flamanville itself has faced severe delays, having initially been scheduled for completion by 2012. Another project under construction in Finland using the same so-called European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) technology has also faced delays and cost overruns. EPR reactors were developed by financially stretched reactor maker Areva, which is in the process of being acquired by EDF following a restructuring of Areva. Areva and its Finnish customer Teollisuuden Voima (TVO) are locked in a multibillion dollar legal battle over compensation. In 2015, Austria launched legal action against the European Commission over the Hinkley Point C project, saying its decision to approve a pricing arrangement that allowed EDF to finance it went against the EU's aim to support renewable energy. Hinkley Point C was also thrown into doubt in 2016 when newly installed British Prime Minister Theresa May put back a decision to approve it, amid criticism that the guaranteed price negotiated with EDF was too high. British government approval eventually went ahead and by March this year, there were 1,600 people working at the site. EDF is building the plant with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), which has a 33.5 percent stake. Two EPRs are also under construction in Taishan, China. Their bases and covers were manufactured by Creusot Forge in France, the same factory that made the flawed cover for Flamanville. $1 = 0.7691 pounds Additional reporting by Sarah Mills in London and Michel Rose in Paris; Writing by Andrew Callus; editing by Susan Thomas and Jane Merriman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/edf-hinkley-idUSL8N1JU14Z"},

Brent crude futures closed up 91 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $49.68 a barrel. The price rose 5.2 percent last week for the first weekly gain in six. U.S. crude futures closed up $1.03, or 2.2 percent, to $47.07 a barrel, an almost one-month high. U.S. crude futures trading volumes were low a day before the U.S. Independence Day holiday. Crude was up for an eighth straight session, the longest stretch of gains since February 2012.   It’s all about market sentiment,  said Commerzbank senior oil analyst Carsten Fritsch. He cited a 100,000 barrel per day drop in U.S. production due to tropical storms and maintenance, as well as a decline in U.S. rig count.   These... (temporary) factors outweigh the sharp increase in OPEC oil production in June... and the continued increase in Libyan and Nigerian output, at least at the moment,  he said. Speculators in Brent crude futures and options raised their bets against a sustained price rise to the highest level on record in the latest week. In a note on Friday, Citibank wrote that the managed net long position was the smallest since January 2016.   After 23 straight weeks of increased rigs, drilling activity for new oil production in the United States fell for the first time since January, dropping by two rigs, while U.S. government data showed crude output fell in April for the first time this year.   We think the fall in prices has caused U.S. output growth to slow,  Standard Chartered wrote in a note on Monday,  Revisions for May and June will confirm that supply is growing at a significantly more modest rate than the market has believed up to now.  The oil price is down more than 12 percent this year, with strong global demand insufficient to absorb rising output from the United States, Nigeria, Brazil, the North Sea and Libya, which has risen to more than 1 million barrels per day. Output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries hit a 2017 high. June OPEC production rose 280,000 bpd to 32.72 million bpd, a Reuters survey showed, despite the group's pledge to hold back output.

Drugmakers, which overwhelmingly favored remaining in the EU, account for 25 percent of all UK business research spending and companies have warned that Brexit threatens uncertainty, added complexity and potential drug approval delays. Jeremy Hunt, the health minister, and Greg Clark, the business minister, wrote a letter to the Financial Times outlining how Britain and the EU could work together. The letter said the government's priority was to protect patient safety, maintain Britain's role as a center for research and promote public health globally. The ministers said there were numerous examples where the partnership between Britain and the EU had helped patients, including the licensing of 130 products for rare diseases.  We will look to continue to work closely with the European Medicines Agency (EMA),  they said.  Our overall aim is to ensure that patients in the UK and across the EU continue to be able to access the best and most innovative medicines.  The London-based EMA currently acts as a one-stop-shop for approving and monitoring the safety of drugs across the EU, but Britain is expected to leave its oversight after Brexit. The agency itself is due to relocate to another city inside the EU. In a bid to limit disruption, drugmakers have been pushing for some kind of partnership deal with the EMA after Brexit, potentially allowing for mutual recognition of medicine approvals. EMA Executive Director Guido Rasi said in April this kind of arrangement was theoretically possible but it would be up to EU governments to decide whether to offer such a deal, since Britain will be outside the single market governing free movement of goods, capital, services and people. Being isolated from the EU system could put British patients at the back of the line for new drugs if companies decide to prioritize Europe, a market of 500 million people, over the UK, where commercial opportunities are far smaller.   Shire (SHP.L) CEO Flemming Ornskov said on Monday that the future of the EMA was his principal Brexit concern.  What is going to happen with the European Medicines Agency? I have 20 projects in late-stage clinical development, so clarity is important,  he told Reuters in an interview.   Although the impact of Brexit on global companies like GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) is likely to be limited, the UK pharmaceuticals trade association has warned that having Britain outside the EU could undermine future investment, research and jobs in the country.  Mike Thompson, CEO of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said the ministers' letter was  a welcome recognition that the future of medicines regulation is a key priority for the government .

Four years ago, the joint program of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), referred to the United States as Germany's  most important friend  outside of Europe. The 2013 program also described the  friendship  with Washington as a  cornerstone  of Germany's international relations and talked about strengthening transatlantic economic ties through the removal of trade barriers. But the words  friend  and  friendship  are missing from the latest election program - entitled  For a Germany in which we live well and happily  - which Merkel and CSU leader Horst Seehofer presented on Monday ahead of a Sept. 24 election. Instead, the United States is described as Germany's  most important partner  outside of Europe. CDU officials were not immediately available to comment on the change in wording. The change in wording underscores how relations between Berlin and Washington have deteriorated since U.S. President Donald Trump entered the White House in January. During his campaign for the presidency, Trump said that Merkel was  ruining  Germany with migration policies he described as  insane . He has repeatedly denounced Germany's trade surplus with the United States, accused Berlin and other European partners of owing  massive amounts of money  to NATO, and unsettled western partners with his decision last month to pull out of the Paris climate accord.. A survey by the Pew Research Center last week showed that just 35 percent of Germans have a favorable view of the United States, down from 57 percent at the end of President Barack Obama's term. Merkel is due to host Trump and other leaders at a G20 summit in Hamburg later this week. In place of the 2013 passage about strengthening economic ties, the 2017 program refers to historical U.S. support for Germany after World War Two and in the run-up to German reunification. The new CDU/CSU election program also repeats a line that Merkel used in a speech in Munich in late May after a difficult summit of G7 leaders, where Trump resisted pressure from six other nations to stay in the Paris agreement.  The times in which we could fully rely on others are, to a certain extent, in the past. We Europeans must take our fate into our own hands more decisively than we have in the past,  the program reads. While affirming Germany's commitment to the NATO military alliance, the program says that the EU must be in a position to defend itself independently if it wants to survive in the long run. It also adds a special section entitled  Germany and France as the Motor of Europe  which vows to  reinvigorate the friendship  between the two countries.  We are ready, together with the new French government, to further develop the euro zone step by step, for example through the creation of its own monetary fund,  it reads. But it also rules out the mutualization of debt in Europe and says that  solidarity  will only be possible if EU countries stick to the rules of the bloc's Growth and Stability Pact.

Ty Cobb, a white-collar defense lawyer with the firm of Hogan Lovells and a former federal prosecutor, met with Trump about a week ago, another person said. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the administration had  no announcement at this time.  Cobb did not respond to comment except to say he was on vacation. Cobb, 66, represented a number of individuals in government investigations during the Clinton administration, including former Democratic National Committee fundraiser John Huang and former White House aide David Watkins. Trump has been seeking a senior-level lawyer to join the office led by White House Counsel Don McGahn to focus on the various Russia investigations, one of the people said. In addition to a probe by special counsel Robert Mueller, several congressional panels are investigating Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential collusion by Trump's campaign. Moscow has denied any interference and Trump has denied any collusion. The role Cobb met with Trump about is separate from the legal team gathering to represent the president personally. That team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, now includes constitutional lawyer and evangelical radio talk show host Jay Sekulow, Washington lawyer John Dowd, and Michael Bowe, a partner at Kasowitz’s firm. According to sources familiar with the matter, lawyers from major firms have turned down joining Trump's outside legal team, citing conflicts at their firms and concerns Trump would not listen to them. Others lawyers have also turned down the role for which Cobb is being considered. William Burck, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, and Emmet Flood, a partner at Williams & Connolly, both turned down the opportunity, according to people familiar with the matter. Cobb, a distant relative of the famous baseball player of the same name, graduated from Harvard University and earned his law degree at Georgetown. In the 1980s, he was a federal prosecutor in Baltimore, where he led a regional drug and organized crime task force. Cobb has some experience with leaks, which Trump has repeatedly complained about in relation to the Russia probes. In 2006, Cobb represented former CIA official Mary McCarthy, who was fired after she was accused of providing classified information to reporters. No charges were brought against McCarthy.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-russia-lawyer-idUSL1N1JU190"},

Brent crude futures closed up 91 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $49.68 a barrel. The price rose 5.2 percent last week for the first weekly gain in six. U.S. crude futures closed up $1.03, or 2.2 percent, to $47.07 a barrel, an almost one-month high. U.S. crude futures trading volumes were low a day before the U.S. Independence Day holiday. Crude was up for an eighth straight session, the longest stretch of gains since February 2012.   It’s all about market sentiment,  said Commerzbank senior oil analyst Carsten Fritsch. He cited a 100,000 barrel per day drop in U.S. production due to tropical storms and maintenance, as well as a decline in U.S. rig count.   These... (temporary) factors outweigh the sharp increase in OPEC oil production in June... and the continued increase in Libyan and Nigerian output, at least at the moment,  he said. Speculators in Brent crude futures and options raised their bets against a sustained price rise to the highest level on record in the latest week. In a note on Friday, Citibank wrote that the managed net long position was the smallest since January 2016.   After 23 straight weeks of increased rigs, drilling activity for new oil production in the United States fell for the first time since January, dropping by two rigs, while U.S. government data showed crude output fell in April for the first time this year.   We think the fall in prices has caused U.S. output growth to slow,  Standard Chartered wrote in a note on Monday,  Revisions for May and June will confirm that supply is growing at a significantly more modest rate than the market has believed up to now.  The oil price is down more than 12 percent this year, with strong global demand insufficient to absorb rising output from the United States, Nigeria, Brazil, the North Sea and Libya, which has risen to more than 1 million barrels per day. Output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries hit a 2017 high. June OPEC production rose 280,000 bpd to 32.72 million bpd, a Reuters survey showed, despite the group's pledge to hold back output. On Monday at an event in London, Iraq's oil minister, Jabar al-Luaibi, said the country has the right to achieve oil output in line with its crude reserves.

The EPA on June 5 announced a stay in the rule, which would have required drillers and transporters to start reporting and fixing any methane leaks they found in wells and transfer stations, after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt wrote in an April 18 letter the agency intended to reconsider imposing it. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the agency did not have the authority to halt the rule during those deliberations.  The EPA's stay  is essentially an order delaying the rule's effective date, and this court has held that such orders are tantamount to amending or revoking a rule,  Judges David Tatel and Robert Wilkins wrote. The third member of the three-judge panel, Judge Janice Rogers Brown, dissented.   We are reviewing the opinion and examining our options,  an EPA spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters. The court's ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed June 5 by green groups that opposed the EPA's stay of the rule. The groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense Fund, Sierra Club and other environmental organizations, argued the EPA did not follow procedures detailed in the 1970 law known as the Clean Air Act when it froze the rule.  This is a big win for public health and a wake-up call for this administration,  said Tim Ballo, a staff attorney for the group Earthjustice, one of the groups participating in the case. David Doniger, director of the NRDC's Climate and Clean Air Program, said other courts could follow suit on pending challenges to Pruitt's suspensions of a slew of EPA rules, including those governing methane leakage from landfills and protections from chemical accidents and pesticides.  This is the first court to rule and the first to strike him down,  he said. Pruitt has vowed to make conditions more favorable for oil, gas and coal companies. In his April letter, he said he had begun examining a set of EPA regulations known as the Clean Power Plan following an executive order by Trump to  suspend, revise, or rescind  rules that  potentially burdened the development  of U.S. energy sources.

Wilander told Reuters reports of the Scot's ailing body seemed very wide of the mark.  If Murray was injured he would not be playing here at all,  Wilander said in the grounds of the All England Club.  I think because he is out there and playing he is 100 percent fit. Or thereabouts ... nobody is ever 100 percent, but he is there or thereabouts.  In any case, the adrenaline of playing Wimbledon today will have completely washed away any little thing. He looked really good.  Murray delivered the same message.  I felt good. I moved well,  the top seed told reporters.  So, yeah, for a first match, considering how I was feeling five, six days ago, it was really positive.  Observers remarking that he seemed to be hobbling, or in discomfort, between points were off the mark, Murray said.

The EPA on June 5 announced a stay in the rule, which would have required drillers and transporters to start reporting and fixing any methane leaks they found in wells and transfer stations, after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt wrote in an April 18 letter the agency intended to reconsider imposing it. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the agency did not have the authority to halt the rule during those deliberations. The EPA's stay  is essentially an order delaying the rule's effective date, and this court has held that such orders are tantamount to amending or revoking a rule,  Judges David Tatel and Robert Wilkins wrote. The third member of the three-judge panel, Judge Janice Rogers Brown, dissented.  We are reviewing the opinion and examining our options,  an EPA spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters. The court's ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed June 5 by green groups that opposed the EPA's stay of the rule. The groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense Fund, Sierra Club and other environmental organizations, argued the EPA did not follow procedures detailed in the 1970 law known as the Clean Air Act when it froze the rule.  This is a big win for public health and a wake-up call for this administration,  said Tim Ballo, a staff attorney for the group Earthjustice, one of the groups participating in the case. David Doniger, director of the NRDC's Climate and Clean Air Program, said other courts could follow suit on pending challenges to Pruitt's suspensions of a slew of EPA rules, including those governing methane leakage from landfills and protections from chemical accidents and pesticides.  This is the first court to rule and the first to strike him down,  he said. Pruitt has vowed to make conditions more favorable for oil, gas and coal companies. In his April letter, he said he had begun examining a set of EPA regulations known as the Clean Power Plan following an executive order by Trump to  suspend, revise, or rescind  rules that  potentially burdened the development  of U.S. energy sources.

In recent years, Moscow has cut off gas shipments during pricing disputes with neighboring countries in winter months. Exports from the United States would help reduce their dependence on Russia. Trump will tell the group that Washington wants to help allies by making it as easy as possible for U.S. companies to ship more liquefied natural gas (LNG) to central and eastern Europe, the White House said. Trump will attend the  Three Seas  summit - so named because several of its members surround the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas - before the Group of 20 leading economies meet in Germany, where he is slated to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time. Among the aims of the Three Seas project is to expand regional energy infrastructure, including LNG import terminals and gas pipelines. Members of the initiative include Poland, Austria, Hungary and Russia's neighbors Latvia and Estonia. Trump's presence will give the project a lift, said James Jones, a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander. Increased U.S. gas exports to the region would help weaken the impact of Russia using energy as a weapon or bargaining chip, said Jones.  I think the United States can show itself as a benevolent country by exporting energy and by helping countries that don’t have adequate supplies become more self-sufficient and less dependent and less threatened,  he said. Trump's Russia policy is still taking shape, a process made awkward by investigations into intelligence findings that Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Russia denies the allegations and Trump says his team did not collude with Moscow. Lawmakers in Trump's Republican Party, many of whom want to see him take a hard line on Russia because of its interference in the election and in crises in Ukraine and Syria, support using gas exports for political leverage.  It undermines the strategies of Putin and other strong men who are trying to use the light switch as an element of strategic offense,  said Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado who is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Kremlin relies on oil and gas revenue to finance the state budget, so taking market share would hurt Moscow.  In many ways, the LNG exports by the U.S. is the most threatening U.S. policy to Russia,  said Michal Baranowski, director of the Warsaw office of think-tank the German Marshall Fund. Competitive Arena The U.S. is expected to become the world's third-largest exporter of LNG in 2020, just four years after starting up its first export terminal. U.S. exporters have sold most of that gas in long-term contracts, but there are still some volumes on offer, and more export projects on the drawing board. Cheniere Energy Inc, which opened the first U.S. LNG export terminal in 2016, delivered its first cargo to Poland in June. Five more terminals are expected to be online by 2020. Tellurian Inc has proposed a project with a price tag of as much as $16 billion that it hopes to complete by 2022, in time to compete for long-term contracts to supply Poland that expire the same year and are held by Russian gas giant Gazprom .  We would like to be a supplier that competes for that market,  Tellurian Chief Executive Meg Gentle told Reuters. A global glut in supply may, however, limit U.S. LNG export growth, regardless of Trump's support. The glut has depressed prices and made it difficult for LNG exporters to turn a profit, said Adam Sieminski, an energy analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Russia has the advantage in Europe due to its proximity and pipeline connections. Nord Stream Europeans will be watching to see whether Trump clarifies his administration's position on a new pipeline to pump Russian gas to Germany, known as Nord Stream 2. The U.S. Senate in June passed a package of sanctions on Russia, including provisions to penalize Western firms involved in the pipeline. The new sanctions have stalled in the House of Representatives. The U.S. State Department has lobbied against the pipeline as a potential supply chokepoint that would make Europe more vulnerable to disruptions. The threat of sanctions adds to tensions between Washington and Berlin. Germany's government supports the pipeline, and Trump's position on it is a concern for European diplomats.

Dealers continued to buy back Chicago Mercantile Exchange July hog contracts        and roll positions into deferred months such as most-active August hog futures       , traders and analysts said.     July, August, December        and other back months all reached lifetime peaks. July hog futures settled up 0.075 cent at 90.700 cents per pound and August up 0.650 at 84.400 cents.     Strong demand for pork has propped up prices for cash hogs and hog futures, despite a record-large U.S. hog herd. The U.S. Department of Agriculture at midday said the wholesale pork cutout was up $1.30 to $104.22 per cwt, highest since October 2014, led by firmer prices for pork bellies, loins and butts.                   The product is really solid, very impressive,  Archer Financial Services broker Dennis Smith said of wholesale pork.     Prices for pork and beef generally ease as retailers wrap up meat purchases in advance of the U.S. Independence Day holiday on July 4. Retailers stock their stores to satisfy consumer demand for hot dogs and burgers to cook on outdoor grills.     The higher pork prices so far this week suggested that demand could remain robust even after the Fourth of July peak of summer grilling season.     USDA showed wholesale choice-grade beef prices down $1.16 to $223.57 per cwt, with beef values extending losses after reaching a multiyear high in mid-June.     Cattle futures were mostly lower, pressured by technical selling and as rising corn futures       stoked fears of higher feed prices for cattle feedlots.     Feeder cattle futures, which reflect prices that feedlots buy cattle to fatten mostly on corn, fell sharply as Chicago Board of Trade corn rallied.     CME August feeder cattle        finished 1.825 cents lower at 146.100 cents per pound while CME August live cattle        were down 0.550 cent to 115.750 cents per pound.

Oil prices resumed their longest stretch of daily gains in more than five years after data pointed to moderating U.S. crude output, though analysts said news of rising OPEC production could cap the rally. The S&P; 500 index rose after notching its strongest first half-year performance since 2013 in a shorter trading day ahead of Tuesday's Independence Day, a full-day holiday for U.S. financial markets.  Stocks, U.S. currency and treasury yields were also helped by solid economic data on Monday. And investors appeared to  get used to the idea central banks including the European Central Bank could move away from stimulus measures such as bond purchases and ultra-low interest rates.  People are realizing that even if they move quicker than they expected there's not going to be a dramatic shift. Today is a little more of a calmer market that's saying we can get through these hawkish dynamics,  said Nathan Thooft, senior managing director at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 129.64 points, or 0.61 percent, to 21,479.27, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 5.6 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,429.01 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 30.36 points, or 0.49 percent, to 6,110.06.

Short-dated U.S. Treasury yields, the most sensitive to U.S. Federal Reserve rate policy, surged. Two-year yields touched 1.426 percent US2YT=RR, marking their highest since 2009, while benchmark 10-year yields US10YT=RR hit a nearly seven-week high of 2.353 percent. Analysts said traders were selling Treasuries ahead of Friday's U.S. June employment report, which could push yields higher if jobs and wage growth beat expectations.  The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity rose to 57.8 last month from 54.9 in May.  The remarks from last week from central bankers and the ISM data from today help continue to pressure rates higher, and if we do get a solid number on Friday, that could keep the sell-off going,  said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, gained 0.6 percent in its biggest one-day gain in roughly four months helped by the economic data and rising U.S. bond yields. U.S. crude oil futures CLc1 settled up 2.2 percent at $47.07, hitting the highest point since June 7, while Brent crude LCOc1 was last up 1.9 percent to $49.68 a barrel.

Danone said on Monday that Stonyfield had around $370 million in turnover in 2016, and that the sale price represented a multiple of around 20 times the 2016 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for Stonyfield.

Nadal missed the warm-up grass tournament at Queen's Club to look after his battered body following victories at the French Open and in Madrid, Monte Carlo and Barcelona but he looked comfortable on the faster surface and displayed the full array of groundstrokes that have earned him two Wimbledon titles. Millman, who missed the first five months of the season with a groin injury, played his part in some entertaining rallies, particularly in the first two sets as Nadal, playing conservatively, worked on his rhythm. However, the fourth-seeded Spaniard, who missed last year's Wimbledon through injury and was playing his first grass tournament match for two years, was always in control and seemed to be more concerned about his own shots than anything his opponent could dish up. Nadal really hit his stride in the final set once he had mastered his timing, smashing a series of blistering forehands that left Millman as much a spectator as those crammed into Number One Court. He finished with a flourish - a trade-mark crashing forehand on to the line - to wrap up the ideal victory in well under two hours. Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 3, 2017   Spain’s Rafael Nadal shakes hands with Australia’s John Millman after winning their first round matchToby Melville It was a very positive match for me, a good start,  Nadal told reporters.

After reaching the final in five out of six years from 2006-2011 Nadal has had something of a torrid time at Wimbledon since, losing twice in the second and once in the first and fourth.   I'm happy because I didn't win a lot of matches in the last couple of years here,  he said.  Today I did and I'm looking forward to play the second one.  For all the players it is so special to play here and for me, after the history I have here, I am very happy to be back.

The neighbors came close to war in 1996 over islets known as Imia in Greek and Kardak in Turkish. The Greek coast guard said it had fired warning shots as it was trying to inspect the ship's cargo after receiving an anonymous call that it was carrying narcotics. The vessel did not cooperate and subsequently moved back to Turkish waters, it said in its statement. The broadcaster NTV reported that two Turkish coast guard ships were at the scene, and quoted Turkey's Foreign Ministry as saying it was in contact with the relevant authorities. Kalkavan confirmed that the ship, which had set off from the Turkish city of Iskenderun, near the Syrian border, had returned to Turkish waters.

The EPA on June 5 announced a stay in the rule, which would have required drillers and transporters to start reporting and fixing any methane leaks they found in wells and transfer stations, after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt wrote in an April 18 letter the agency intended to reconsider imposing it. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the agency did not have the authority to halt the rule during those deliberations. The EPA's stay  is essentially an order delaying the rule's effective date, and this court has held that such orders are tantamount to amending or revoking a rule,  Judges David Tatel and Robert Wilkins wrote. The third member of the three-judge panel, Judge Janice Rogers Brown, dissented.  We are reviewing the opinion and examining our options,  an EPA spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters. The court's ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed June 5 by green groups that opposed the EPA's stay of the rule. The groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense Fund, Sierra Club and other environmental organizations, argued the EPA did not follow procedures detailed in the 1970 law known as the Clean Air Act when it froze the rule.  This is a big win for public health and a wake-up call for this administration,  said Tim Ballo, a staff attorney for the group Earthjustice, one of the groups participating in the case. Pruitt has vowed to make conditions more favorable for oil, gas and coal companies in the United States. In his April letter, he said he had begun examining a set of EPA regulations known as the Clean Power Plan following an executive order by Trump to  suspend, revise, or rescind  rules that  potentially burdened the development  of U.S. energy sources.

Gertjan Vlieghe, one of the eight sitting members of the Monetary Policy Committee, told the Independent newspaper:  This is an environment where a premature hike would be a bigger mistake than one that turns out to be slightly late.  Vlieghe is widely considered to be the MPC member who is most supportive of keeping rates low. He voted for a rate cut in July last year, shortly after the Brexit vote, a month before his colleagues followed suit. Britain's economy has slowed as the rise in inflation since the Brexit vote and a slowdown in pay growth have hurt consumer spending.   I think the consumption slowdown is here, it’s not over,  Vlieghe said.  I don’t think there’s going to be a sufficient offset from investment and net exports to compensate for that.  Some BoE officials do believe that the consumer slowdown will be offset by higher exports and investment. Two of the sitting eight monetary policymakers voted last month for a rate hike. A third supporter of a hike has since left the BoE. Shortly after last month's 5-3 split, the Bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was also likely to vote for a rate hike later this year, adding to speculation that Britain might be heading for higher borrowing costs far sooner than investors had been expecting.  BoE Governor Mark Carney has said he will watch to see how the economy copes with Brexit and for any signs of improvement in weak wage growth as he considers whether to raise rates over the coming months. Vlieghe said that, while inflation was  uncomfortably high , upward pressure on prices would also prove temporary.  What I want to emphasize is that I don’t think there is no risk from keeping rates on hold. I just think that we are still in an environment where one of those risks is bigger than the other one,  he told the Independent. The MPC's next policy decision is due on Aug. 3.

The greenback just came off its worst quarter since 2010 last week as overseas central banks have signaled they are considering whether to begin reducing monetary stimulus in light of evidence their local economies are doing better.  The market is debating whether central banks could follow through with their tightening. So far the data are going central banks' way,  said Steven Englander, head of research and strategy at Rafiki Capital Management in New York. Earlier Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 57.8 last month, the highest reading since August 2014. This upbeat factory report propelled benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR to 2.353 percent, the highest in nearly seven weeks, Reuters data showed.  A closely watched index that tracks the dollar against six major currencies .DXY was 0.62 percent at 96.223, marking its biggest one-day increase since March 1. The dollar index rebounded from a near nine-month low seen on Friday. It shed 4.71 percent in the second quarter, its steepest quarterly loss since the 8.49 percent drop in third quarter of 2010. Speculators have reduced to net bullish dollar bets to their fewest in about year last week, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed late Friday. The greenback climbed to a six-week high against the yen at 113.45 yen. It was last up 0.9 percent at 113.40 yen JPY=. The euro EUR= retreated from its highest in more than a year against the dollar set last week. It was last down nearly 0.6 percent at $1.1358. The single currency brushed off a Reuters report that said some European Central Bank policy-makers were wary of removing the easing bias in its policy statement at its July 20 meeting.  Currency trading activity was muted ahead of the U.S. July Fourth holiday. U.S. financial markets will close early on Monday and will be shut on Tuesday.

Nicholas Paget-Brown, the leader of Kensington and Chelsea council, resigned last week after he was criticized for the council's response to the Grenfell Tower fire, which spread rapidly through a social housing tower block in the middle of the night.  It is ... vital that we put in place long-term support for the longer-term recovery. It was right that the leader of the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea took the decision to move on,  Communities Minister Sajid Javid told parliament.  I look forward to working with the new leader of the council, and I will look at every option to ensure that everyone affected by this tragedy has the long-term support they need.  Fire tests are being carried out at high-rise buildings similar to Grenfell Tower. Cladding from 181 blocks so far having failed safety tests . The large number of buildings that have failed tests was  obviously disturbing,  Javid said, adding that there had been a 100 percent failure rate among samples tested.  We ourselves have asked questions about the testing regime after discovering the 100 percent failure rate so far. Last week, I asked for the testing regime to be independently assessed,  Javid said.  This was carried out by the Research Institutes of Sweden, and they have confirmed they believe the process to be sound.  The results of the tests meant the cladding - put on tower blocks for aesthetic and insulation purposes - probably violated fire-safety regulations, Javid said.   Every failed test means the panels are unlikely to be compliant with the limited combustibility requirement of the building regulations guidance,  he said.

Last week, Morocco's central bank postponed for  a few days  its planned announcement of the first phase of liberalizing the dirham, a key reform backed by the International Monetary Fund. The central back gave no reason for the delay. In a weekend interview on Morocco's two public television channels, Othmani said he met with Finance Minister Mohammed Boussaid and central bank Governor Abdellatif Jouahri to discuss the move to a flexible currency regime and  the decision will be made at the right time.  The dirham's value is now fixed by a peg that is weighted 60 percent to the euro and 40 percent to the dollar. The first stage of reform will let the currency trade in a narrow range, which will widen over the course of up to 15 years. The apparent delay left traders worried about the progress of the liberalization. Morocco has advanced more than its North African neighbors in fiscal reforms, but like Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria, it is wary of unrest from currency shifts or cuts in state subsidies on fuel and basic foods. According to one source with knowledge of the process, the delay was caused by  last-minute fine tuning,  although neither the central bank nor the government has said exactly how long the announcement will be delayed.  What is proposed is a move to 5 percent margin,  the prime minister said, confirming a previous Reuters report that trading fluctuation will widen to 2.5 percent each way.  It's not a floating of the dirham, but it's just a degree of flexibility in the price of the currency,  he said.  Trading fluctuations are now only about 0.6 percent. Othmani also denied reports one reason for the delay was a depletion of foreign reserves by $4.4 billion in the last two months. All Moroccan institutions involved in the process would need to agree about moving to a flexible regime in  order to protect the purchasing power of the Moroccan citizen,  he said. Othmani also said the government had decided to reform the currency. The central bank's role was making preparations and  taking the necessary precautions, approving the procedures.   It has the tools to intervene in the appropriate time to maintain the trading margin. This is the general context,” Othmani said of the central bank.

But vaccination can help prevent shingles, which is caused by herpes zoster - the same virus that causes chickenpox, study author Dr. Sung-Han Kim of Asan Medical Center in Seoul said in an email.  Individuals should talk with their doctors about preventing shingles “until further studies elucidate the effect of vaccination on cardiovascular outcomes,” Kim said. Kim and his colleagues analyzed the medical records of more than 23,000 shingles patients between 2003 and 2013, and compared them with the same number of patients who didn’t get shingles. People who got shingles were more likely to be female and have common heart risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and older age, the study found. But they also were less likely to smoke and they drank less alcohol, got more exercise and were in a higher socioeconomic class, according to the report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. After adjusting for these and other factors that could influence the risk of heart problems and stroke, the researchers found that overall, having shingles was associated with a 41 percent increased risk of any heart-related problem, a 35 percent increased risk of stroke and a 59 percent increased risk of a heart attack.  The odds of stroke were especially high in people age 40 or younger, whose risk was 3.74 times that of peers without a history of shingles.  The risks for both stroke and heart attack were also highest in the first year after the onset of shingles and dropped over time. Kim stressed that patients and doctors should be aware of the increased risks, although more studies are needed to understand the connection between these conditions. Dr. Lee Schwamm, vice chair of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, suggested that inflammation plays a role. “We’ve known for a long time that there is an interplay between inflammation and clotting,” he told Reuters Health in a phone interview.  When someone gets shingles, the virus may move through the skin and directly attack and inflame blood vessels, as well as certain nerves, Schwamm said. Inflamed blood vessels may cause the blood to clot, setting the stage for a heart attack or stroke. Inflammation of nerves can cause the severe pain, called post-herpetic neuralgia, that often accompanies shingles. “There’s no definitive proof of the relationship between inflammation and clotting, but the evidence is growing and it’s very intriguing,” Schwamm said. “And it emphasizes the value of trying to prevent shingles in the first place by getting vaccinated.”  Whether treating shingles will reduce the risks is unknown, he added.  Dr. Talia Swartz, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, said the findings are consistent with previous studies linking shingles with heart attack and stroke. Nevertheless, the study has some limitations, she told Reuters Health. There may have been undocumented differences between patients in the two groups, as well as differences in shingles severity among those who got the disease. In addition, the incidence of shingles in people under age 65 is much higher in the study than in the U.S., and so the findings may not hold true here. In the U.S., shingles rates in people under 40 are expected to fall because so many were vaccinated for chickenpox as children, and rates are low in those who had the chicken pox vaccine, she said by email.  As for the shingles vaccine, it not only helps prevent the condition in people over 60, it may prevent a recurrence in those who have already had shingles, she added. So even people who have already had shingles should get the vaccine, Swartz said. Regarding the heart attack and stroke risks, both Schwamm and Swartz stress that following a healthy lifestyle is the best way to lower risks - keep cholesterol, blood sugar and weight under control, exercise regularly and don’t smoke.

With her dazzling smile, the photogenic and articulate 24-year-old Californian of Korean descent could be a marketer’s dream if she continues to hit the high notes on the course as well as she does on the piano. At her victory press conference at Olympia Fields, Kang pulled out her smartphone when asked which of her famous friends she had heard from with congratulations. “Dustin said ‘that’s how you’re supposed to play’,” she said as she scrolled through the messages, meaning men’s world number one Dustin Johnson. “Wayne Gretzky texted me as well, Caitlyn Jenner, Marcus Allen,” she said, referring to ice hockey great Gretzky, Olympic decathlon champion (and transgender woman) Jenner and American football (NFL) Hall of Fame inductee Allen. Kang made such celebrity connections as a regular player at Sherwood Country Club in the hills north of Los Angeles, where the membership over the years has included Sean Connery, Jack Nicholson and O.J. Simpson. She is clearly comfortable hanging out with the rich and famous, but until Sunday had proven less self-assured when in contention in professional golf tournaments. Batting 0-for-143 in terms of wins in LPGA Tour events, the twice U.S. Amateur champion took a share of the lead into the final round of the year’s second major, though it would be fair to say she was hardly an overwhelming favorite.

Former world No. 1 Mats Wilander was among those to suggest that the best thing Djokovic could do would be to take an extended break after Wimbledon, allowing him to rest and regain the form that deserted him in the first half of the year.     But Agassi, who began working with Djokovic at the French Open last month, says Djokovic is motivated to do the hard work required now, rather than later.     “What’s really beneficial is being clear,” Agassi said. “A break isn’t beneficial if you’re not giving yourself a break because you know you want to be doing something else.     “Playing isn’t beneficial when you’re spent and you feel like you need a break and your team’s pushing you to play. So does he need a break? No, I think he’s ready and he has clear objectives.”     When Djokovic was beaten by Dominic Thiem in the French Open quarter-finals, Agassi had already left Paris, due to prior commitments.     He will be at Wimbledon throughout – handily coinciding with his role as ambassador for the Italian coffee company, Lavazza.    The way Djokovic faded in the third set against Thiem in Paris led some to suggest that Agassi may have underestimated the magnitude of his task.     But as the Serb earned his first title since January by winning in Eastbourne last weekend, former world number one Agassi said he had not been under any illusions before accepting the role, a job he says he is doing for free.     “You’ve got to remember my history coming into this - I’ve seen behind the curtain so I don’t look at these guys as machines,” said the 47-year-old American who won eight grand slam titles.     “I knew what I was getting into. I knew it was a daunting task to care about somebody and care about him enough to show reservations. It’s easy to say this is how you play your best tennis but he knows that, everybody knows,  he added.     “We all go through that as former number one players in the world or champions who have gotten over the finishing line. “We all go through that and I think I went through that as extreme as anybody.”     Agassi said he was confident Djokovic would find a way back to his best, sooner rather than later.     “I’m learning (about) somebody who has many more skills than me and a huge heart – the heart of a lion – and the work ethic of a soldier,” he said.     “It’s beautiful tools to work with. I can honestly say the hardest part about winning Wimbledon, the French or any of the slams, with his skill-set would be sleeping at night because I’d be excited to play the next day.” Editing by Ed Osmond","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-wimbledon-djokovic-idUSKBN19O27B"},

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity rose to 57.8 last month from 54.9 in May. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 55.2.     The expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for roughly 12 percent of the overall U.S. economy, combined with hawkish comments last week from the heads of the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to pressure yields higher.      Analysts also said traders were selling Treasuries in anticipation of Friday's U.S. June employment report, which could push yields higher if jobs and wage growth beat expectations. Economists polled by Reuters expect U.S. employers to have added 179,000 jobs last month.       The remarks from last week from central bankers and the ISM data from today help continue to pressure rates higher, and if we do get a solid number on Friday, that could keep the sell-off going,  said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.     Short-dated U.S. Treasury yields, which are considered most sensitive to Fed rate policy, surged. Two-year yields touched 1.426 percent to mark their highest since early June 2009, while three-year yields touched their highest in more than three months of 1.595 percent.      Benchmark 10-year yields hit a nearly seven-week high of 2.353 percent, while 30-year yields touched their highest in nearly three weeks of 2.873 percent. Five- and seven-year yields hit their highest since early May of 1.941 percent and 2.199 percent.      Analysts said trading volume was thin, with the U.S. bond market closing early at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) ahead of the July 4 Independence Day holiday.      (The manufacturing data) reinforces the risk of a tighter Fed,  said Bruno Braizinha, interest rates strategist at Societe Generale in New York.     Braizinha added that since expectations of another rate hike from the Fed had bottomed out in recent sessions, there was a greater risk of traders pricing in higher expectations of another Fed rate hike this year if Friday's employment report beats expectations.      A raft of weak U.S. economic data, including soft inflation readings, had reduced expectations of another rate rise in recent weeks.

Last week, Morocco's central bank postponed for  a few days  its planned announcement of the first phase of liberalizing the dirham, a key reform backed by the International Monetary Fund. The central back gave no reason for the delay. In a weekend interview on Morocco's two public television channels, Othmani said he met with Finance Minister Mohammed Boussaid and central bank Governor Abdellatif Jouahri to discuss the move to a flexible currency regime and  the decision will be made at the right time.  The dirham's value is now fixed by a peg that is weighted 60 percent to the euro and 40 percent to the dollar. The first stage of reform will let the currency trade in a narrow range, which will widen over the course of up to 15 years. The apparent delay left traders worried about the progress of the liberalization. Morocco has advanced more than its North African neighbors in fiscal reforms, but like Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria, it is wary of unrest from currency shifts or cuts in state subsidies on fuel and basic foods. According to one source with knowledge of the process, the delay was caused by  last-minute fine tuning,  although neither the central bank nor the government has said exactly how long the announcement will be delayed.  What is proposed is a move to 5 percent margin,  the prime minister said, confirming a previous Reuters report that trading fluctuation will widen to 2.5 percent each way.  It's not a floating of the dirham, but it's just a degree of flexibility in the price of the currency,  he said.  Trading fluctuations are now only about 0.6 percent. Othmani also denied reports one reason for the delay was a depletion of foreign reserves by $4.4 billion in the last two months. All Moroccan institutions involved in the process would need to agree about moving to a flexible regime in  order to protect the purchasing power of the Moroccan citizen,  he said. Othmani also said the government had decided to reform the currency. The central bank's role was making preparations and  taking the necessary precautions, approving the procedures.   It has the tools to intervene in the appropriate time to maintain the trading margin. This is the general context,” Othmani said of the central bank.

The settlement by the Tolkien estate and book publisher HarperCollins with the Time Warner Inc unit, New Line Cinema and Saul Zaentz Co, which hold various marketing rights, was disclosed in a court filing on Friday in Los Angeles. It also resolves counterclaims by Warner Bros. and Zaentz. Terms were not disclosed.  The parties are pleased that they have amicably resolved this matter and look forward to working together in the future,  Warner Bros. spokesman Paul McGuire said in a statement on Monday. Bonnie Eskenazi, a lawyer for Tolkien's estate and HarperCollins, which is a unit of News Corp, provided a nearly identical statement. Tolkien's estate had accused the defendants of violating a 1969 agreement allowing the sale  tangible  merchandise, by associating the books with the  morally-questionable (and decidedly non-literary) world of online and casino gambling.  It said this  outraged Tolkien's devoted fan base  and irreparably harmed the legacy of the English author, who died in 1973 at the age of 81. The copyright lawsuit was filed in November 2012.

The Royal Free NHS Trust failed to comply with the Data Protection Act when it passed on personal information of around 1.6 million patients to Google's DeepMind.  There's no doubt the huge potential that creative use of data could have on patient care and clinical improvements, but the price of innovation does not need to be the erosion of fundamental privacy rights,  Elizabeth Denham, head of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), said in a statement. The data was provided in a medical trial that integrated information from existing systems used by the Royal Free to alert clinicians when signs of deterioration in a patient with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) were found. The investigation found that many patients did not know their data was being used as part of a test.  We accept the ICO's findings and have already made good progress to address the areas where they have concerns,  the trust said in a statement. As a result, the trust has signed a document agreeing to make change to the way it handles data. Although the ICO's findings related to the hospital, Google's artificial intelligence arm has also taken responsibility, admitting it underestimated the complexity of Britain's state-run National Health Service and the rules around patient data.  We were almost exclusively focused on building tools that nurses and doctors wanted, and thought of our work as technology for clinicians rather than something that needed to be accountable to and shaped by patients, the public and the NHS as a whole,  Google DeepMind said in a statement.

Since taking office shortly before Kuczynski's term began about a year ago, Comptroller Edgar Alarcon has criticized several public work projects that the executive has tried to advance as the economy has slowed. Alarcon most recently accused three of Kuczynski's ministers of improperly pressuring him to produce a favorable review of an airport contract. Two leaked audio recordings of meetings Alarcon had with the ministers appeared to support that allegation - leading the opposition-controlled Congress to force one minister to resign last month. On Monday, lawmakers voted unanimously to remove Alarcon for  serious misconduct  for allegedly directing public funds to the mother of his children, violating ethics rules by running a business while in office, and coercing an auditor to withhold information from Congress. Alarcon denied any wrongdoing, including accusations by the ruling party that he had secretly recorded his meetings with Kuczynski's Cabinet to destabilize the government.  I've been a target of extensive attacks by the media,  Alarcon said in a presentation before Congress. Alarcon said the next comptroller would be expected to turn a blind eye to irregular government contracts. While Alarcon's departure will likely be a relief for Kuczynski's government, audits of projects and government activities that started on his watch may continue, including a review of state-owned energy company Petroperu's oil refinery expansion plan and the recent $2 billion bond issuance to finance it. Kuczynski will have to appoint a new comptroller to a seven-year term with the help of the right-wing opposition party, Popular Force, which has a majority of seats in Congress and is led by Kuczynski's former electoral rival, Keiko Fujimori. After losing three ministers to congressional pressure, Kuczynski said last month that it was time for him to consider pardoning Fujimori's father, imprisoned former President Alberto Fujimori - widely seen as a bid to appease Popular Force.

But an agreement between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists, which he said was achievable within days if the parties were willing to compromise, would be  profoundly in the best interests of Northern Ireland .  Irish nationalists Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have been in talks since a March election to form a new power-sharing government and each has blamed the other for missing repeated deadlines - most recently last Thursday.  A prolonged failure would ultimately force the British government to bypass the regional assembly and revert to direct rule from London for the first time in a decade, a move that could destabilize the political balance in the province. Northern Ireland's political scene has been in crisis since the collapse in January of the power-sharing coalition mandated under a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian violence in which 3,600 died. The Irish and British governments, who are facilitating the talks, have warned that failing to reach an agreement would have  profound and serious  implications and limit Northern Ireland's influence in Brexit negotiations, although no one is forecasting a return to serious violence. Brokenshire declined to set a new deadline for agreement, but warned that London's patience was wearing thin six months after Sinn Fein's withdrawal from government sparked the crisis.   This hiatus cannot continue for much longer,  he told parliament in London.  Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, James Brokenshire, leaves Downing Street after a cabinet meeting, in central London, Britain June 20, 2017.Eddie KeoghBrokenshire said if there was no resolution in the coming days, the British government would  urgently reflect  on whether to give civil servants extra powers to allocate resources and may consider introducing legislation to facilitate this.  While this falls short of direct rule, Brokenshire made clear the British parliament would keep taking on more and more powers over Northern Ireland the longer it remains without an executive.  The British government's other option would be to call new elections in Northern Ireland and Brokenshire said he would keep that under review - although he said another vote was unlikely to solve the impasse.  Before Brokenshire's speech, DUP leader Arlene Foster accused Sinn Fein of  political grandstanding  and demanding an unrealistic number of concessions from the talks. Sinn Fein's northern leader Michelle O'Neill accused Brokenshire of  pandering to the DUP  who she said were blocking the legitimate demands of Irish nationalists. Sinn Fein has questioned the neutrality of Brokenshire after his Conservative Party struck a deal last week with the DUP to prop up Prime Minister Theresa May's government. Commentators see little prospect of agreement during the July marching season, when pro-British unionists celebrate the 1690 victory by Protestant King William of Orange over his Catholic rival at the Battle of the Boyne. A major sticking point is Sinn Fein's demand for an Irish language act. Proposed measures such as bilingual road signs and quotas for Irish speaking civil servants are anathema to some unionists.

The baby, 10-month-old Charlie Gard, has been at the center of a long legal battle between his parents, who wanted him to undergo an American therapy trial, and specialists at the hospital in London who said the treatment was experimental and would not help.  If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so,  Trump said in a morning Twitter post. The baby, who will be 11 months old on Tuesday, suffers from a rare genetic disorder that has left him unable to move his arms, legs or to breathe unaided. He has a form of mitochondrial disease – a genetic condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. Trump waded in to the complex case as his fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate struggled to reach consensus on a healthcare reform plan that would slash spending on healthcare for low-income Americans.  It was unclear how the U.S. president would propose to help in the case. The baby's parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, launched a fundraising appeal to help pay for his doctors' bills in the United States. They have raised 1.3 million pounds ($1.68 million) from more than 83,000 donations, according to his Gofundme page.  Britain's Supreme Court ruled last month that going to the United States for treatment would prolong the baby's suffering without any realistic prospect of helping him. The court would not allow an American doctor found by the couple to be identified and details about the therapy were not available.  The parents asked the European Court of Human Rights to overturn the ruling, but that court last week declined to intervene. Trump weighed in on Charlie Gard a day after Pope Francis. “The Holy Father is following the case of little Charlie Gard with affection and emotion and expresses his closeness to his parents. He is praying for them, hoping that their desire to accompany and care for their own child to the end is not ignored,” according to statement from the Vatican on Sunday. UK Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman, asked about the Trump tweet, said it was a very sensitive case and their thoughts are with Charlie’s family.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-britain-infant-idUSKBN19O24G"},

Gabriel is on a tour of the Gulf region, where four Arab states have cut diplomatic and commercial ties with Qatar over claims that it is financing militant groups. Qatar rejects the accusations.  An agreement on ending any kind of support for terrorist or extremist organisations  would be the best solution to the crisis, Gabriel told reporters after a two-hour meeting with his Saudi counterpart Adel el-Jubeir.  We all know that (this support) is not organised by states, but often by private persons,  he added.  But we must somehow succeed in ending support in the region for extremist and terrorist organisations.  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt are pressing Qatar to shutter its Al Jazeera news TV station and dial back its relations to Iran, Saudi Arabia's arch-rival in the Gulf region. Despite the pressure on Qatar, Gabriel said he did not get the impression after his meeting that the states were calling Qatar's sovereingty into question.

Wimbledon got me like: Easy standing drills this morning. Go easy,  the 2016 champion posted to her 6.1 million followers.  Her coach Patrick Mouratoglou told Reuters at the French Open last month that the 23-times grand slam champion was still hitting and working out to keep her touch.  Even though she has been out of action for nearly six months, she has also still been making the tennis headlines. Last week, she took to Twitter to ask John McEnroe for  respect  after the seven-times grand slam champion said his fellow American would be ranked  like 700 in the world  if she had to play on the men's circuit. Serena not being at from the grasscourt major is clearly a loss for some fans.  I'm not even watching women's Wimbledon without you. I just won't be able to.

Tolkien has settled an $80 million lawsuit against Warner Bros. over the licensing of online games, slot machines and other gambling-related merchandise based on the author's books  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings.  The settlement by the Tolkien estate and book publisher HarperCollins with the Time Warner Inc unit, New Line Cinema and Saul Zaentz Co, which hold various marketing rights, was disclosed in a court filing on Friday in Los Angeles. It also resolves counterclaims by Warner Bros. and Zaentz. Terms were not disclosed.  The parties are pleased that they have amicably resolved this matter and look forward to working together in the future,  Warner Bros. spokesman Paul McGuire said in a statement on Monday. Bonnie Eskenazi, a lawyer for Tolkien's estate and HarperCollins, which is a unit of News Corp, provided a nearly identical statement. Tolkien's estate had accused the defendants of violating a 1969 agreement allowing the sale  tangible  merchandise, by associating the books with the  morally-questionable (and decidedly non-literary) world of online and casino gambling.  It said this  outraged Tolkien's devoted fan base  and irreparably harmed the legacy of the English author, who died in 1973 at the age of 81. The copyright lawsuit was filed in November 2012. Total worldwide grosses exceeded $2.9 billion for each of the big-screen trilogies for  The Lord of the Rings,  released from 2001 to 2003, and  The Hobbit,  released from 2012 to 2014, according to Box Office Mojo.

Dow transports set new record high","keywords":"United States,Chuck Carlson,Dow 30,Dow Jones Transport,NASDAQ Composite,USA,STOCKS/TRANSPORTS (UPDATE 1),Americas,Company News,Equities Markets,Volatile Shares / Hot Stocks,Corporate Events,United States","sector":"Markets","content":"(Updates throughout to reflect Dow transports also closed at a record high) By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - U.S. market watchers on Monday received a bullish sign to kick off the second half of the year as the closely followed Dow transports set record highs for the first time since March 1. The Dow Jones Transport Average index, which includes airlines, railroads and package delivery companies, is often viewed as a barometer of economic activity. The 20-component index eclipsed its March 1 intraday record of 9,639.33, rising as high as 9,681.88 during the session. It also tallied its first closing high since March 1, finishing at 9,639.63, up 0.8 percent on the day.  If people are looking for validation that the economy is still on pretty solid footing and can continue to kind of accelerate, that’s a good sign to see,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana and a contributing editor to the Dow Theory Forecasts newsletter. Dow Theory tracks the transports and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to confirm major trends in the stock market. While the Dow industrials have been setting successive record highs over the past six weeks, the transports slumped after March 1 and only recently surged back to record territory. A new closing high for the transports reconfirms the bull market trend, which  emboldens investors to buy the dips,  said Carlson. Among the stocks giving the index the biggest lift on Monday were freight and logistics company Landstar System Inc , trucking and transportation logistics company J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc and railroad Norfolk Southern Corp. The transports' record surge, on a shortened trading day ahead of the July Fourth holiday, came on a generally higher day for the broader market. The benchmark S&P; 500 rose 0.2 percent and the Dow industrials gained 0.6 percent, while a decline in the technology sector dragged the Nasdaq Composite 0.5 percent lower. The Dow industrials' 8 percent rise in the first six months of the year marked their best first-half performance since 2013.

Ties between Berlin and Ankara have soured over the past year due to disagreements on a range of political and security issues, including Turkey's jailing of a German-Turkish journalist and its refusal to let German lawmakers visit German troops at a Turkish air base. Erdogan was also infuriated by what he called  Nazi era tactics  when some local German authorities, citing security concerns, barred Turkish politicians from campaigning in Germany ahead of a referendum on expanding the president's powers.  Last week Germany rejected a request from Ankara that Erdogan be allowed to address members of the 3 million-strong ethnic Turkish community living in Germany during the G20 summit. In unusually strong language that underlined the poor state of relations, a German foreign ministry spokesman said even appearances by Erdogan at a Turkish consulate or via a video feed would  would be an affront to the clearly expressed will of the government and a violation of German sovereignty .  Appearances of this nature have to be requested well in advance,  Martin Schaefer told a news conference when asked about  rumors  that Erdogan might still address Germany's Turks despite Berlin's request. He said Germany could not ban Erdogan from speaking at a Turkish consulate, but had options for influencing such actions. Last week German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said he did not want to see Turkish domestic conflicts played out among the Turkish community in Germany - a reference to deep political divisions within Turkey.

Former Chief Executive John Varley along with Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath were charged by Britain's Serious Fraud Office last month in the first criminal prosecution for senior bankers' actions during the financial crisis. Barclays Plc was also charged with fraud and unlawful financial assistance. Lawyers representing Jenkins and Boath said in June they would contest the charges, while those representing Varley and Kalaris declined to comment. Barclays, which has previously said it is considering its position, declined to comment.  In a 60 minute hearing at Westminster magistrates court, the case was sent to Southwark Crown Court, with the next hearing scheduled for July 17.  The defendants did not enter any pleas.  The case is likely to be the last chance for prosecutors in Britain to bring criminal charges against bank executives for actions taken during the financial crisis, with the charges carrying a maximum jail term of 10 years. It is also a test of the Serious Fraud Office, after Britain's ruling Conservative party in its election manifesto called for the prosecutor to be folded into the National Crime Agency. Former Barclays CEO John Varley arrives at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London, Britain July 3, 2017.Neil HallAdvisory Payments The case centers on agreements between Barclays and Qatari investors during two fundraisings in June and October 2008. Qatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested around 5.3 billion pounds in Barclays. Slideshow (3 Images)Authorities have examined whether payments from Barclays to Qatar at the same time, such as around 322 million pounds in  advisory services agreements  (ASA), alongside the $3 billion loan, were honest and properly disclosed. Varley, 61; former Middle East and North African investment banking head Jenkins, 61; Kalaris, once the CEO of Barclays Wealth, also 61; and Boath, a 58-year-old former European head of financial institutions, were charged over disclosure of the June 2008 deal. Varley and Jenkins face a further charge for the October deal, and a charge of 'unlawful financial assistance' which alleges the fundraising breached rules preventing a company lending a third party money to buy its own shares. Chris Lucas, finance director of Barclays in 2008, is listed as a co-conspirator to the charges, but has not been charged. A lawyer who represents Lucas declined to comment. Jenkins, who lives in the United States, and Kalaris, who has dual-nationality, were each asked to post 500,000 pounds in bail. The other defendants were not given any bail requirements.

Also helping sentiment was data that showed U.S. factory activity jumped in June to its highest level in almost three years suggesting economic growth in the second quarter gained some steam, while construction spending held steady in May. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 57.8 last month from 54.9 in May. In a bullish signal for the market, the Dow Transportation Average, which includes airlines, railroads and package delivery companies and is often viewed as a barometer of economic activity, closed at a record.   If (people) are comfortable with the economy, the transports certainly is a leading sector. If the economy is going to get better, transports, rails, truckers, airlines and all that stuff will do better in anticipation of that,  Polcari said.   Automakers advanced, with Ford up 3.3 percent and General Motors up 1.8 percent as vehicle sales figures for June showed retail sales to consumers were relatively stable at the U.S. automakers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.55-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.51-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Drugmakers, which overwhelmingly favoured remaining in the EU, account for 25 percent of all UK business research spending and companies have warned that Brexit threatens uncertainty, added complexity and potential drug approval delays. Jeremy Hunt, the health minister, and Greg Clark, the business minister, wrote a letter to the Financial Times outlining how Britain and the EU can work together. The letter says the government's priority is to protect patient safety, maintain Britain's role as a centre for research and promote public health globally.

The UK is fully committed to continuing the close working relationship we enjoy with our European partners,  they said.  Our overall aim is to ensure that patients in the UK and across the EU continue to be able to access the best and most innovative medicines.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Monday its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 57.8 last month, its best performance since August 2014, from 54.9 in May. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for roughly 12 percent of the overall U.S. economy.  The ISM index provides further evidence that the prospects for the manufacturing sector remain bright,  said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics. The reading adds to encouraging signs that the U.S. economy rebounded strongly in the April-June quarter. Following the data, the Atlanta Federal Reserve raised its forecast for second-quarter GDP to a 3.0 percent annualized rate from its previous forecast of 2.7 percent. On Friday, the Commerce Department also reported that the U.S. economy grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, less slowly than previously estimated. The ISM survey's new orders sub-index rose to 63.5 in June from 59.5 the prior month. A measure of factory employment increased to a reading of 57.2 from 53.5 in May. According to ISM, comments from those surveyed generally reflected expanding conditions,  with new orders, production, employment, backlog and exports all growing in June compared to May and with supplier deliveries and inventories struggling to keep up with the production pace.   Fifteen of the 18 manufacturing industries reported growth in June.  Another survey released on Monday, the Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, gave its lowest reading since last September The dollar rose to a session high against a basket of currencies after the ISM data, while the yield on the 2-year U.S. Treasury note rose to a more than eight-year high.

The Commerce Department said on Monday that construction spending in May remained unchanged at $1.23 trillion.

A construction worker on a building site in downtown Los Angeles, California, March 10, 2015.Lucy NicholsonEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.3 percent in May.

At times Murray limped around the baseline but luckily for the defending champion, that problem disappeared the moment the ball was in play as he easily outclassed maverick Wimbledon debutant Alexander Bublik 6-1 6-4 6-2 to reach the second round.  My hip felt good. It's a little bit sore, but I was moving really good on the court today,  said Murray, who is the first British man to be seeded number one at Wimbledon since Bunny Austin in 1939.   If you're in a little bit of pain, but you can still run as you normally do, that doesn't affect how you play.  Asked why he was limping between points, he added:  Whether it's something that's just happened... like, subconsciously, my hip's been sore, I have no idea. I'm not in a lot of pain when I'm walking, that's for sure.  There was so much uncertainty about the Scot's form in the days running up to the grasscourt major, one British bookmaker had declared Murray 'friendless' - with punters backing him to lose early rather than win the title for the third time. Some doomsayers even feared he could become only the third men's defending champion -- after Manuel Santana in 1967 and Lleyton Hewitt in 2003 -- to lose in the first round. Others highlighted how Murray was on a two-match losing streak against players classified as lucky losers - as Bublik was having lost in the final round of qualifying but made it into the main draw thanks to another player's withdrawal. Unconventional Shots But any hopes that the 135th-ranked Kazakh could add his name to that illustrious list of 'lucky losers' were swiftly extinguished as Murray did not let Bublik's array of unconventional shots, or two rain breaks, throw him off course. Bublik threw in a tweener - a between-the-legs shot with his back to the net - he threw his body around the court a la Boris Becker and even threw in a few comical grunts that drew laughter from the Centre Court crowd.  Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 3, 2017   Kazakhstan’s Alexander Bublik in action during his first round match against Great Britain's Andy MurrayAndrew CouldridgeBut try as he might, the 20-year-old failed to convert any of the six break points he earned. Bublik also showed that he has a novel way at following orders.   Earlier this year he had asked  Sir Andy  Murray for tips on  how to become as good as you are . The world number one had told him  (By) not serving 20 double faults in a match.  So what did Bublik do? He served only 12 double faults on Monday.  Slideshow (2 Images) We were waiting to go out the beginning of the third set (following a rain break) ... (and) he said to me 'Yeah, thanks for the advice about not serving 20 double-faults,  said Murray.   I said 'You served a few'.  He said, 'Yeah, I think I'm only on about 10 right now'.  I said 'Well, there's still time to get to 20. It was just funny.  Murray's hips woes, though, are no laughing matter and he was quick to turn his focus on preparing for his second-round match against flamboyant German showman Dustin Brown.  I'll spend some time with my physio this evening, get an ice bath, then have a light practice tomorrow. I'll work a bit on my passing shots and lobs because it will be a different match against Dustin Brown,” he said. Despite the swift exit, Bublik was left buzzing.  Thanks sir @andymurray and @wimbledon for an amazing experience, best day of my Life so far,  he said on Instagram.

McLaren tested the new Spec Three power unit in Friday practice in Baku and Honda's F1 head Yusuke Hasegawa said they would be racing with it in Spielberg.

By Nick Carey DETROIT, July 3 (Reuters) - Major automakers on Monday posted mixed U.S. new vehicle sales figures for June, with the U.S. automakers reporting lower numbers while the major Japanese automakers said their sales were up versus the same month in 2016. Automakers' shares rose as retail sales to consumers were relatively stable at the U.S. automakers, with General Motors Co asserting that the industry was set for a stronger finish to the year. Wall Street expectations were for a fourth straight month of declining sales in June. The U.S. auto industry has been bracing for a downturn after hitting a record 17.55 million new vehicles sold in 2016. A glut of nearly new used vehicles poses competition for new vehicle sales and automakers have relied increasingly on high consumer discounts and loosened lending terms. Car shopping website Edmunds said on Monday the average length of a car loan reached an all-time high of 69.3 months in June.  It's financially risky, leaving borrowers exposed to being upside down on their vehicles for a large chunk of their loans,  said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry analysis. General Motors Co said its sales fell about 5 percent versus June 2016, but that the industry would see stronger sales in the second half of 2017 versus the first half.  U.S. total sales are moderating due to an industry-wide pullback in daily rental sales, but key U.S. economic fundamentals clearly remain positive,  said GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem.  Under the current economic conditions, we anticipate U.S. retail vehicle sales will remain strong for the foreseeable future.  Ford Motor Co said its sales for June were hit by lower fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government entities, which fell 13.9 percent, while sales to consumers were flat. GM shares were up 2.8 percent in late morning trading on Monday, while Ford shares rose 3.9 percent. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) said June sales decreased 7 percent versus the same month a year earlier. Toyota Motor Corp said sales rose 2.1 percent versus June 2016 and said it saw strong gains in the RAV4, a light SUV, sales of which increased 24.7 percent. Sales of another SUV, the 4Runner, rose 16.6 percent. But sales at Toyota's Lexus luxury car brand fell 5.4 percent on the year. Nissan Motor Co Ltd said its U.S. sales increased 2 percent. But while truck, SUV and crossover sales jumped 19.5 percent, sedan sales dropped 12.1 percent. In the past few years, Americans have increasingly shunned smaller passenger cars in favor of larger vehicles. Honda Motor Co Ltd said sales for June were up 0.8 percent.

Michael Lemmon, a former University of Utah finance professor and a senior researcher within BlackRock's quantitative Scientific Active Equity unit, left for Citadel LLC, a spokeswoman for Ken Griffin's hedge fund confirmed. Paddy McCrudden, a former Australia-based portfolio manager and mathematician who was most recently a senior strategist for BlackRock's quant unit in New York, also left the company, BlackRock confirmed. Both former employees hold PhDs and were managing directors at BlackRock. Both declined to comment. A BlackRock spokeswoman confirmed the departures but declined to comment further. In March, BlackRock announced a major overhaul of its actively managed equities business, cutting jobs, dropping fees and relying more on computers to help pick stocks. The move handed over more assets and prominence to BlackRock's high-performing Scientific Active Equity group, based primarily in San Francisco, that uses rigorous quantitative analysis of data to generate investment ideas. The project also dramatically increases the budget for a team focused on data analysis. The strategy, internally code-named  Monarch,  is designed to jumpstart BlackRock's stock funds business, which has delivered mixed performance overall. Over five years, 90 percent of assets run by the Scientific team were beating their benchmark, according to data BlackRock reported to shareholders at the end of March. That compares to 49 percent of assets run by BlackRock's traditionalist  Fundamental  team. BlackRock will update those figures on July 17 when it reports second-quarter earnings. The asset management business is being reordered by a move from funds in which managers pick promising individual stocks to lower-cost index funds that own the entire market. Lemmon co-authored a  Financial Analysts Journal  article last year that argued that asset managers that charge high fees and struggle to justify their value face  extinction  as they compete both with fairly simple quant portfolios and highly sophisticated investors. BlackRock is a major provider of index funds through its iShares business and has seen its stock market value swell to record levels even as many of its competitors languish. BlackRock managed $5.4 trillion on March 31, with $286 billion in active equities. In all, actively managed funds represent nearly a third of BlackRock's assets but an outsized near-50 percent of its fees.

Following the data, the Atlanta Federal Reserve raised its forecast for second-quarter GDP to a 3.0 percent annualized rate from its previous forecast of 2.7 percent. On Friday, the Commerce Department also reported that the U.S. economy grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, less slowly than previously estimated. The ISM survey's new orders sub-index rose to 63.5 in June from 59.5 the prior month. A measure of factory employment increased to a reading of 57.2 from 53.5 in May. According to ISM, comments from those surveyed generally reflected expanding conditions,  with new orders, production, employment, backlog and exports all growing in June compared to May and with supplier deliveries and inventories struggling to keep up with the production pace.   Fifteen of the 18 manufacturing industries reported growth in June.  Another survey released on Monday, the Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, gave its lowest reading since last September The dollar rose to a session high against a basket of currencies after the ISM data, while the yield on the 2-year U.S. Treasury note rose to a more than eight-year high.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record high.

Elected only two months ago by a hefty majority, Macron told the lawmakers of both houses, summoned especially to the Palace of Versailles, that he wanted to cut the number of lawmakers by a third, curb the executive's role in naming magistrates, and introduce a  dose  of proportional representation. Macron's upstart Republic on the Move (LREM) party has secured a comfortable majority in the National Assembly - but France's youngest leader since Napoleon made clear his impatience to complete the reshaping of the political landscape that he has begun.  The French people are not driven by patient curiosity, but by an uncompromising demand.

We have managed crises but we have lost our way,  Macron said.  I firmly believe in Europe, but I don't find this scepticism unjustified.  Macron, whose centrist platform has routed both the traditional rightist and leftist parties of government, is not the first French leader to convene a so-called Congress of both houses, though past presidents have tended to use it in times of crisis or for constitutional reforms.      Macron's aides had said that, by bringing parliament's 925 lawmakers to the 17th century palace built outside Paris by Louis XIV - the 'Sun King' - the president was seeking to restore old-fashioned grandeur to the role. French President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech during a special congress gathering both houses of parliament (National Assembly and Senate) at the Versailles Palace, near Paris, France, July 3, 2017.Eric Feferberg/Pool Jupiterian  President Macron himself has said he plans a  Jupiterian  presidency - as a remote, dignified figure, like the Roman god of gods, who weighs his rare pronouncements carefully. It would be a marked break from his unpopular and often-mocked predecessor Francois Hollande's man-of-the-people style. While many in France still hold dear the trappings of presidential power, Macron's style has grated with others who lament the strong powers that the constitution drawn up by the war hero Charles de Gaulle bestows on the presidency. Slideshow (11 Images)A commanding parliament majority, including dozens of legislators who are new to politics, has tightened Macron's grip further still. Nonetheless, his opponents said his address was light on details.   We're none the wiser coming out than we were going in,  said far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who Macron defeated in the presidential run-off vote.  He speaks of a dose of proportional representation, but we don't know if he's talking about a small dose or a big dose.  Le Pen blames France's electoral system for her National Front party's poor representation in parliament.  Beyond the plans for institutional reform, which had been outlined in his campaign manifesto, there were few concrete announcements and no specifics on the far more controversial measures that he plans, most notably in liberalizing a highly regulated labor market. Many of those were likely to be sketched out by Macron's prime minister, Edouard Philippe, when he addresses parliament on Tuesday. Opposition lawmakers from three parties including the far-left France Unbowed boycotted Macron's address, and about 100 Communists wearing the red caps of the French revolutionaries of 1789 demonstrated in front of Versailles' town hall.

Now, though, some investors wonder if it is running out of steam. A year after completing its biggest ever deal, the $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta, investors are fretting over weakened margins and big challenges in the hemophilia business it inherited with the U.S.-based group. Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov recognizes the risk, but told Reuters an overnight slump in the company's share of the $11 billion-a-year hemophilia market was highly unlikely. The threat will be crystallized next week when Roche reports detailed results for its new drug ACE910, which tackles the inherited bleeding disorder in an innovative way and could displace conventional hemophilia therapies. Early generic competition to flagship gastrointestinal drug Lialda has added to Shire's problems, offsetting positive news on treatments against rare diseases and attention deficit disorder. Another worry is Shire's debt pile in the wake of Baxalta, which has put on hold the Dublin-based firm's past business model of regular bolt-on deals of up to a few billion dollars. Daniel Mahony, a fund manager at Polar Capital, who has sold his Shire shares in recent months, says that leaves sales and profit growth unclear.  Historically, Shire has derived more growth from M&A; than organically, but they've got to a point now where they seem to be running out of deal runway,  he said. With the one-time stock market darling underperforming the European drugs sector by around 20 percent this year, Ornskov admits he doesn't get many compliments from investors - but he insists Shire is on track with Baxalta. CEO of Shire, Dr Flemming Ornskov, poses for a photograph in London, Britain, July 3, 2017.Peter Nicholls This is a totally different scale and you need a bit more patience, you need a bit more time. In the end we will deliver the same outcome: we will pay off the debt and we will improve margins,  he said.  The Street is wanting to see quarter-by-quarter that we can actually integrate this business, that we haven't over-stretched and can pay down debt.  With analysts not expecting Shire to repay all its debt from the Baxalta acquisition before the end of the decade, Ornskov said large-scale M&A; was not on the agenda for now, although he would continue to shop for individual products. Margins would return from today's high 30s percent to pre-Baxalta levels in the mid 40s, he added. Slideshow (3 Images)Sanguine on Roche Drug Ornskov is sanguine about the threat from Roche, pointing out that ACE910 is likely to take time to win widespread adoption, especially outside the United States, where many contracts are based on long-term supply tenders. The notion that a new drug, which still faced questions about safety and tolerability, could damage Shire's hemophilia franchise overnight was not  super realistic , he added.  The proof will be in the pudding. What I am most focused on is to build out the business, because outside the U.S. there's significant growth ... in just getting more patients treated.  Similarly, Shire's $800 million-a-year gut drug Lialda will still retain  significant  market share because other generic manufacturers are unlikely to follow Zydus Cadila's lead in winning approval for copies any time soon. Ornskov said many companies had tried to copy the formulation, and Zydus had only won approval by conducting its own clinical trials.  To make a comparison from Zydus to all the other ones, is I think a stretch of the imagination,  he said. Editing by Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-shire-ceo-idUSKBN19O211"},

Prime Minister Abdelmadjid Tebboune's plan follows the launch of an anonymous online campaign that blames African migrants - whose numbers are unofficially estimated at 100,000 - for taking jobs and spreading the HIV virus that causes AIDS. Youth unemployment is running at around 30 percent in Algeria, but the country also faces a shortfall of workers in some sectors as it tries to steer its economy away from over-reliance on oil and gas production. To determine the number of beneficiaries of the scheme, the interior ministry is organizing a census while security services will screen potential residency candidates.  They will get a residency document which will allow them to get a job,  Tebboune told lawmakers on Friday night.  We won't allow any NGO or individual to tarnish the image of our country.  He gave no further details on the scheme. African migrants in Algeria are mostly from Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso and have come to escape acute poverty and terrorism back home. Some use Algeria as a transit country en route to Europe via neighboring Libya.  That's great news, I will be happy if I can work under the framework of the law,  said a young Malian working illegally in a housing project as a mason in Ouled Fayet, west of Algiers. Tensions African migrants work at the construction site of a building in Algiers, Algeria June 29, 2017.Ramzi BoudinaTensions between Algerians and the migrants often boil over. A year ago in Bechar, in western Algeria, rioting broke out after a local woman was believed to have been kidnapped by the migrants. The online anti-migrant campaign has shocked many in Algeria, which sees itself as a leading influence in the Sahel region and more widely in Africa, for example negotiating a peace deal in 2015 in Mali. Slideshow (13 Images)The campaign also appears to have embarrassed the government in a country that takes pride in its history as a bastion of anti-colonialism after its own 1962 war of independence against France. Last month a hashtag  No to Africans in Algeria  was widely shared on Twitter and Facebook, calling for expulsions to protect Algerian families and prevent  chaos . Amnesty International's local representative, Hassina Oussedik, has urged the government to do more to protect African migrants.   Algeria has embarked on politically sensitive reforms to modernize its still largely state-run economy, but it has been hit hard by a crash in oil prices that has deprived the country of more than half of its revenues. The migrants already present in the economy tend to work illegally and are very often underpaid, human rights groups say. Some economists doubt the government's plan will make much difference to Algeria's workforce, while others view it as a way to further monitor traffic across its southern borders, where Islamist militant groups are active.  The goal of most of the migrants is definitely to reach the El Dorado in Europe,  economist Arslan Chikhaoui told Reuters.  Algeria is still only a transit destination.

So we managed for next year to avoid any clash with WEC, which is good news,  Agag told Reuters.   We cannot really try to avoid clashes with Formula One. But as we don’t have common drivers, it’s no problem.  Formula One's commercial rights holders Liberty Media have already agreed with the governing FIA that their 21 race season will not clash with Le Mans, as it did last year. In 2015 there was no overlap and the endurance race at the Sarthe circuit was won by a Porsche crew that included then-Force India Formula One driver Nico Hulkenberg, now with Renault.

An MRI exam detected a torn patellar tendon. He will seek a second opinion.  At this point, we don't know if it is surgical or non-surgical,  Royals manager Ned Yost said. Strahm noted he heard his knee pop while leaping for a Miguel Sano high bouncer in the fourth inning of the first game of a doubleheader Saturday.  And then I couldn't power off it,  Strahm said. Until the club knows the severity of the injury, there is no timetable for his return. If surgery is necessary, the 25-year-old would miss the remainder of the season.

In addition to the fractured wrist, an MRI exam on Hardy's ribcage revealed a fractured bone. Hardy said he would likely be able to play with that injury.

He will not be taking his All-Star break in someplace other than Frederick or Delmarva.  Davis is batting .226 with 14 home runs and 26 RBIs over 61 games. However, he has struck out 95 times.

He has struck out 64 of the 126 batters he has faced this season (50.7 percent). Kimbrel is an All-Star for the sixth time in his seven full seasons in the majors.  It's an honor,  Kimbrel said.  Sixth All-Star Game now, feels kind of crazy to think about. The experience is still going to be fun, getting to take my family down there and spend two days in Miami.  A knee injury prevented him from participating last season.

He leads the majors with 166 strikeouts. He has had 11 starts this season in which he has had 10 or more strikeouts. He is 11-3 with a 2.61 ERA in 17 starts. It is the sixth consecutive All-Star selection for the 28-year-old. He has appeared four times, all with the Chicago White Sox, and got the start last year.  It's still special,  Sale said.  Being on a new team, being in a new city makes it a little bit more special, too.  Manager John Farrell said:  When he walks to the mound, we have a pretty good feel that we're going to win.  INF Deven Marrero was 3-for-5 with a double Sunday in the 15-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays to extend his hit streak to a career-best six games.

SS Xander Bogaerts (left-groin tightness) was a late scratch from the lineup Sunday. He was listed as day-to-day. He is a final vote candidate for the All-Star Game.   It would be great if the fans supported him and deservedly so,  manager John Farrell said.  He's having a very good year. It's a bumper crop at the position, we know.  RF Mookie Betts, who will be going to the All-Star Game as a reserve, matched his career high Sunday with eight RBIs in the 15-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays. He had two-run and three-run homers and an RBI single and a two-run single in going 4-for-6. He also had eight RBIs on Aug. 14 against the Arizona Diamondbacks.  Today I felt pretty good,  Betts said.  I got some good pitches to hit and just tried to put a good swing on it and hope for the best. When you get to the plate, you're just expecting a good pitch to hit and you're ready for it. Today I was just more ready than other days.   He has hit 13 of his 15 homers on the road. Betts has reached base in seven straight games, going 14-for-29 (.483). He became the first leadoff hitter in Red Sox history with eight RBIs in a game and the first since INF Ronnie Belliard did so for the Colorado Rockies in 2003.

Second and third, no outs, is not a fun situation to come in as a reliever,  Williams said.

Marte had displaced Andrew McCutchen in center before the start of the season, but McCutchen regained that spot during the suspension, and Gregory Polanco is in right. Hurdle said Marte will probably move up to Triple-A Indianapolis this week and play a full nine innings next week. LHP Tony Watson (2-4) took the loss. He inherited runners at second and third, no outs, in the seventh and gave up back-to-back singles as San Francisco scored three runs in the inning to take the lead.

I've had some pretty good ABs. I'm just trying to go out there and play good baseball and compete every day.  RHP Jake Arrieta was downright dominant at times. Joe Maddon's litmus test to evaluate Arrieta's stuff on Sunday was how he fared against Reds first baseman Joey Votto, arguably one of the best hitters in all of baseball. Votto went 1-for-3 against Arrieta with a strikeout but managed to do something against him no other Reds batter could -- get a hit. Arrieta allowed only a single by Votto through seven innings in a 6-2 victory. Arrieta, pitching in Great American Ball Park where he hurled a no-hitter on April 21, 2016, retired 10 straight in one stretch and 19 of the final 20 batters he faced.  Votto did not have good at-bats against him, that tells me his stuff was very good,  said Maddon.  That was as good as we've seen Jake in a bit. If he keeps pitching with that command, the confidence is going to come up. I was just watching their hitters react.  2B Javier Baez entered Sunday's game 1-for-16, went 3-for-4 with two doubles and an RBI.

RHP Paul Blackburn, who pitched a gem in his major-league debut on Saturday against Atlanta, will remain in the rotation. Blackburn will replace RHP Jesse Hahn, who was optioned to Triple-A Nashville on Sunday. Blackburn allowed one unearned run over six innings and got a no-decision in a 4-3 loss Saturday. A's manager Bob Melvin was impressed by the rookie's debut and said he wanted to see him make at least one more start.  He looked real composed yesterday, for a guy that you thought maybe some nerves would be involved,  Melvin said.  Worked quick, made a good play, fields his position well. Quick to the plate, a lot of the intangible things sometimes younger guys have trouble with. But not only that, he was economical. He threw the ball over the plate and made them hit the ball. It was impressive to see.  The A's acquired Blackburn from Seattle during the offseason in exchange for INF Danny Valencia. He was called up from Nashville on Saturday.  I don't really feel like it's hit me yet,  Blackburn said of being in the big leagues.  I think playing with a lot of these guys, and definitely in spring training, has kind of helped a lot coming up here. It's been fun. The couple days I've been up here it's been awesome.

Davis went 2-for-4 and scored twice. SS Marcus Semien (fractured right wrist) will likely be reinstated from the disabled list before the All-Star break, A's manager Bob Melvin said Sunday.

He went 2-for-5 with a walk-off single and two RBIs in the Sounds' 5-4 win against Oklahoma City and played all nine innings in the field for the first time during his rehab assignment.  We'll get a few more of those before he comes back, but we're probably in a position here fairly soon, before the break, to get him back,  Melvin said. RHP Jesse Hahn was optioned to Triple-A Nashville on Sunday. In each of his past two starts, both losses to Houston, Hahn lasted only two innings.  He gave up a combined 16 runs on 15 hits, including three home runs. Hahn is 3-6 with a 5.30 ERA in 14 games, including 13 starts for the A's.  I'm a little frustrated about it,  Hahn said of his demotion.  I'm just going to keep my head up high and continue to pitch the way I pitch. I was kind of judged on two starts here. I'm not going to say they are unfair, but they feel unfair to me. I think I've been having a good year and I feel good about everything.

RHP Paul Blackburn, who gave up one unearned run over six innings against Atlanta on Saturday in his major-league debut, will remain in the rotation and take Hahn's spot.  Well, we wanted to take another look at Blackburn,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  He pitched really well and Jesse struggled a little bit here recently. Finding some consistency is going to be the key for him. We've seen him really good, and we've seen him have some tough outings, but I think it was more about getting another chance to see Blackburn pitch.  3B Matt Chapman (left knee cellulitis) went 0-for-4 as the designated hitter for Class A Stockton on Saturday in his first rehab game. He started at third base for the Ports on Sunday night.  He felt good yesterday,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  Got four at-bats DHing. He'll play in the field today and then we'll see where we're at after that.  There's a chance Chapman could be activated from the disabled list Monday when the A's open a three-game series at home against the Chicago White Sox. 1B Yonder Alonso was named to the American League All-Star team on Sunday, his first career all-star selection. Alonso, 30, has hit a career-high 17 home runs. He's batting .280 with 38 RBIs. The All-Star Game will be held in Alonso's home town of Miami this year.  I'm just so fortunate and obviously so blessed to have the opportunity to represent the Oakland A's and all the guys here. I'm going back to my home where I grew up. It means a lot to me.

Sano has five home runs and 23 RBIs against the Royals this season. He has 39.7 percent of his 58 RBIs this year against the Royals. INF Ehrie Adrianza, who is rehabbing with Triple-A Rochester, could be activated Monday.  Potentially,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  The plan is that he would be available to be activated, we believe. The timing will be the day we pick.  We'll have to see the way he's feeling. He's been hitting the ball hard.  He went on the disabled list June 22 with an abdominal injury. The switch-hitter has a .259 average in 26 games and 54 at-bats. He hit .220 in 154 games over parts of four seasons with San Francisco before the Twins acquired off waivers on Feb. 2. RHP Felix Jorge was optioned to Double-A Chattanooga. He picked up a victory in his major league debut Saturday. He is the 12th Twins pitcher to start and collect a win in his debut. He is the first since Andrew Albers on Aug. 6, 2013, also at Kansas City. LHP Hector Santiago dropped to 0-7 with a 9.96 ERA in his last eight starts, allowing 12 home runs in 28 innings. Manager Paul Molitor is concerned Santiago's velocity declined on Sunday.  I thought there would be more in there, especially after the velocity we saw in Boston (in his previous start on June 27),  Molitor said.  It was down today, for whatever reason. Whether he choose to try to have more command or whatever, it was obvious to everybody it was down.  SS Jefry Marte of the Dominican Republic has agreed to an estimated $3 million signing bonus with the Twins. The 16-year-old switch-hitter is the No. 3 ranked international prospect. Sunday was the first day clubs could sign international players.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-twins-playerwatch-idUSMTZED73IXXPG5"},

Over the last month, Chinese regulators have closed celebrity gossip websites, restricted what video people can post and suspended online streaming, all on grounds of inappropriate content. On Friday, an industry association circulated new regulations that at least two  auditors  will, with immediate effect, be required to check all audiovisual content posted online - from films to  micro  movies, documentaries, sports, educational material and animation - to ensure they adhere to  core socialist values . Topics deemed inappropriate include drug addiction and homosexuality, said the government-affiliated China Netcasting Services Association, which represents more than 600 members. People flocked online at the weekend to criticize the move, with most saying it was a step backwards that would hamper creativity. Some noted it could be near impossible to enforce.  According to these censorship rules, nothing will make it through, which will do away with audiovisual artistic creation,  Li Yinhe, an academic who studies sexuality at the government-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in an online post. Under the government rules, such works as Georges Bizet's opera  Carmen  and Shakespeare's  Othello  would technically have to be banned for depicting prostitution and overt displays of affection, she said. The rules, which affect social media giants like Weibo Corp as well as small platforms that have thrived in China's buzzing creative online space, are the latest step toughening oversight ahead of the Communist Party Congress later this year, when President Xi Jinping is expected to consolidate power. China's online video market, including revenue from advertising and content purchases, had been expected to more than quadruple to around 96.2 billion yuan ($17.6 billion) by 2020 from 2015, according to 2016 data from IHS Markit.  We used to describe the constant drip of regulation as boiling a frog in warm water. Now it is outright scalding with boiling water,  Wang Xiaoxiao, a talent agent who represents several actors who have gained fame online, told Reuters. Zhao Jing, the founder of Yummy, a site that specializes in education on gender topics, said she would be using euphemisms for genitalia and avoid banned topics such as one-night stands and extramarital affairs to get around keywords that will trigger the censors. She fears her site could be thrown off Tencent's WeChat instant messaging application otherwise. Entertainment in Focus While censorship of creative content in China is nothing new, the internet has generally been a more permissive arena because of the grey areas around regulation. The atmosphere has become more tense since Xi called for stricter regulation last year. In June, China's cyberspace authorities ordered internet firms like Baidu Inc and Tencent Holding Ltd to close 60 popular celebrity gossip social media accounts, including  China's Number One Paparazzi  Zhuo Wei, an account that had more than 7 million followers. The government said it aimed to  create a healthy and uplifting mainstream media environment, and actively spread socialist core values.  This focus on online entertainment content - an extension of the government's well-established control over politics and news - is aimed at a largely younger audience, said Qiao Mu, a Beijing-based media scholar known for criticising censorship.  This is a return to ideology,  Qiao said in a phone interview.  To the Party, entertainment will make people lose their revolutionary spirit.  One of the main focuses of online scorn was the inclusion of homosexuality on the list of banned topics, underlining a long-standing conservative attitude in China towards same-sex relations despite often thriving gay scenes in major cities. Two filmmakers interviewed by Reuters said the latest ruling closed one of the remaining channels for uninhibited creative works. Films shown in cinemas or on television already go through thorough censorship processes before being given the go-ahead.  Many filmmakers know they could never get their film approved for cinemas, and so put them online,  said Fan Popo, a gay activist and film director. The only hope for such filmmakers left was that censors would struggle to implement the new rules, he said. The crackdown is also being felt in the country's top internet firms. Shares in Weibo Corp, the operator of China's top microblogging site, are down around 10 percent since restrictions were imposed on its audiovisual content in mid-June. The company said last week it would work closely with state media to promote  mainstream  ideas. For some platforms, investors have pulled funding and advertisers have jumped ship because of the uncertainties, industry insiders told Reuters. Dushe Dianying, or  poison tongue movie , a popular movie-review site known for its acerbic critiques, had its account on WeChat shut down last month by regulators citing  socialist values . The site, backed by German media group Bertelsmann, was valued at 300 million yuan ($44.17 million) last year. A person familiar with the site's operations said some of its business tie-ups and advertising deals had been hit. Others in the industry also said investment had suffered.  It is now just too risky,  said the person, who asked not to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

Pemex is looking for partners to improve the performance of its state-owned refineries, which currently process about 915,000 bpd of crude, well below their combined capacity of 1.6 million bpd. Pemex had previously planned to select a partner before June but the process has fallen behind schedule  because of the complexity and the investment needed,  said a separate industry source with direct knowledge of the project.  Since May, Pemex has invited 56 companies to bid but will not launch a tender as planned, a Pemex source said, calling the process  open, competitive and transparent.  Two years of sagging oil prices and mounting debt have forced the Mexican oil firm to seek equity partners to help fund key projects. Asked about the partnership plan, a Pemex spokesman said the details provided by sources were correct.  Japan's Mitsui & Co., Korea's SK Group, Italy's Eni, China's PetroChina and Sinopec, British-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell Plc and U.S. oil major Chevron are among the companies interested in the project, sources told Reuters in April. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Mexican petroleum company Pemex is seen on a tank gas at a gas station in Mexico City, Mexico, January 2, 2017.Edgard Garrido/File PhotoPemex has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch to help in the search for a partner, the Pemex source said. Tula, like two other Pemex refineries, lacks coking capacity, which boosts production of higher-value fuels like gasoline from Mexico's increasingly heavy crude production. Interested companies are being asked to present their proposals by the third week of August and Pemex will draw up a shortlist by September, two Pemex sources said.  The final selection  will take place in the last week of October,  the first Pemex source said. Tula is Pemex's second largest refinery, with a capacity to process 315,000 barrels per day (bpd) but in May processed 228,126 bpd, company data showed. The new plant will be located adjacent to Pemex's existing Tula refinery, in the central state of Hidalgo.  In 2015, Pemex said it signed a contract with ICA Fluor for engineering, procurement and construction for an initial phase of projects to boost gasoline and diesel output and reduce fuel oil output by building a coking plant. Reuters was not able to confirm the status of the project with ICA Fluor, a joint venture between construction firm ICA and Fluor Corp. In 2016, the state-owned oil company presented a business plan that included the  Tolling coker Tula Alliance  project, as well as partnerships to improve operations and/or reconfigure the Tula, Salamanca and Salina Cruz refineries.

The country exceeded low expectations for its hosting of the eight-team tournament that ended on Sunday, a World Cup dress rehearsal which passed off without any major incidents of fan violence or problems with infrastructure.  FIFA President Gianni Infantino hailed the four-venue tournament as a  great success  after shrugging off the logistical and security concerns that had cast a shadow over Russia's preparations.   We have been hearing before this Confederations Cup about a lot of problems that we would experience here in Russia,  Infantino told a news conference, listing fan indifference, stadium violence, racism and incomplete infrastructure among the potential issues.  We had no incidents. If a problematic tournament looks like this tournament, then I want many of these problematic tournaments going ahead.  The Confederations Cup took place in four cities, Moscow, St Petersburg, Kazan and Sochi, all of which already have solid sports infrastructure and a history of hosting major international events. The country now has to pull together eight additional World Cup venues in seven other cities, including some with limited experience of organizing large-scale events. Russia must also be ready to accommodate four times as many teams, as well as the large crowds that will flock to the country for the tournament. Russian authorities have pledged to draw conclusions from the Confederations Cup but have yet to outline the areas that need improvement ahead of the World Cup.   Everything will be exponentially more difficult (for the World Cup),  TASS news agency quoted Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko as saying on Monday.    But if we transpose the level, the (organization) standard of the Confederations Cup to the World Cup, then it will be a complete success.  Foreign fans were generally upbeat about Russia's organization of the tournament, praising the country for providing free train transportation between host cities.    Everything was great around the stadium but it was more difficult to get around in the cities because few people speak English,  Mexican fan Yajaira Lira, 33, told Reuters ahead of Mexico's third-place match against Portugal.  Addressing Complaints Most of the complaints about the organization of the two-week tournament revolved around the traffic conditions and the state of the pitch in the new St Petersburg stadium, which had to be hurriedly re-laid after it was damaged during the 68,000-seater venue's inaugural match in April.  Mutko said authorities would work to ensure that grass at the St Petersburg pitch, which Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo complained was too long, would be able to sustain the stress of seven World Cup matches.  He told TASS that if the pitch's retractable technology would not work, the grass would have to be re-laid every three months.  Cameroon coach Hugo Broos complained that heavy traffic in Moscow, home to more than 12 million people and notorious for its gridlocks, caused his team to arrive an hour late for a training session. Broos reported similar issues in St Petersburg, Russia's second city.  The local organizing committee did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on how it was addressing Cameroon's concerns. Screening Fans Russia's efforts to curb fan violence at the Confederations Cup succeeded, but it will need to screen a far larger number of local and foreign fans as the World Cup nears.  All ticket holders at the Confederations Cup were required to obtain a personalized fan-ID, allowing authorities to screen them and keep hooligans away from the matches.  Several fans, including some with ties to hooligan movements, said organizers had granted them fan-IDs but revoked them as they made their way to matches, effectively banning them from attending.   Because the Confederations Cup is a rehearsal for the World Cup, I think this type of fan selection will increase,  Vyacheslav Shirinkin, a singer in a punk band that appeals to Russian hooligans whose fan-ID was canceled, told Reuters last month.   I think that apart from some guys with beer bellies, their wives and maybe some kids, other people will not be able to go to games.

With Europe's biggest economy growing robustly, Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), are able to offer voters tax relief and more investment after the Sept. 24 ballot. The allies have put aside their differences over migrants - the CSU wants a cap to which the CDU will not agree - and German media have reported that conservative lawmakers now refer to Merkel and CSU leader Horst Seehofer as the  twins . The conservatives hold a clear opinion poll lead over the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), but would still need to team up with another party to govern. On Monday they added the goal of full employment - which they define as a jobless rate of less than 3 percent - by 2025 to their list of campaign pledges.  We think we can do this,  Merkel told a news conference with Seehofer convened to present the election program, adding that jobs were central to the quest for 'prosperity and security for all'. Related CoverageFactbox: Merkel's conservatives promise full German employment in manifestoGermany's jobless rate is currently at a post-reunification low of 5.5 percent. A level of 3 percent has not been seen since the  Economic Miracle  boom of the mid-1970s. The conservative parties want to add 15,000 police officers in the 16 federal states, build 1.5 million homes during the next parliamentary term, and expand Germany's broadband network. This responds to pressure from the International Monetary Fund and European Commission, which have said Berlin has room to lift investment infrastructure, which would help reduce its huge current account surplus and benefit weaker euro zone peers.

The program included a special section entitled  Germany and France as the Motor of Europe  which vows to  reinvigorate the friendship  between the two countries.

With Europe's biggest economy growing robustly, Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), are able to offer voters tax relief and more investment after the Sept. 24 ballot. The allies have put aside their differences over migrants - the CSU wants a cap to which the CDU will not agree - and German media have reported that conservative lawmakers now refer to Merkel and CSU leader Horst Seehofer as the  twins . The conservatives hold a clear opinion poll lead over the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), but would still need to team up with another party to govern. On Monday they added the goal of full employment - which they define as a jobless rate of less than 3 percent - by 2025 to their list of campaign pledges.  We think we can do this,  Merkel told a news conference with Seehofer convened to present the election program, adding that jobs were central to the quest for 'prosperity and security for all'. Related CoverageFactbox: Merkel's conservatives promise full German employment in manifestoGermany's jobless rate is currently at a post-reunification low of 5.5 percent. A level of 3 percent has not been seen since the  Economic Miracle  boom of the mid-1970s. The conservative parties want to add 15,000 police officers in the 16 federal states, build 1.5 million homes during the next parliamentary term, and expand Germany's broadband network. This responds to pressure from the International Monetary Fund and European Commission, which have said Berlin has room to lift investment infrastructure, which would help reduce its huge current account surplus and benefit weaker euro zone peers.

The forward's agent Juanma Lopez and his father were photographed arriving at Real's Santiago Bernabeu stadium on Monday for a meeting with the European champions, and Spanish daily AS reported the two parties were close to finalising a deal by the end of the week. Europa League holders United depart for their pre-season tour of the United States on July 9, where they will face Real in Santa Clara before taking on the Champions League winners in the UEFA Super Cup on Aug. 8. Former Juventus forward Morata netted 20 times in all competitions last season in 17 starts, giving him the best goals to games ratio of Real's forwards.  He also developed a knack for grabbing vital goals, including late winners against Sporting Lisbon, Villarreal and Athletic Bilbao. A Real academy graduate, Morata made his debut in 2010 under current United boss Jose Mourinho although left the club in 2014 for Juventus, returning two years later when the Spanish side exercised their buy-back clause. As in his last season at Real, he proved decisive for the Serie A champions when called upon, taking Juve to the 2015 Champions League final with a decisive equaliser against Real in the semi-finals and scoring in the 3-1 defeat by Barcelona in the final. Morata, 24, failed to hold down a regular place for Juventus or Real despite his decisive cameo appearances, but if his move to United is completed he can expect to be Mourinho's first- choice striker after the club parted ways with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who suffered a serious knee injury in April.

In fierce fighting, Iraqi army units forced the insurgents back into a shrinking rectangle no more than 300 by 500 meters beside the Tigris river, according to a map published by the military media office. Smoke covered parts of the Old City, which were rocked by air strikes and artillery salvos through the morning.   The number of Islamic State (IS) militants fighting in Mosul has dwindled from thousands at the start of the government offensive more than eight months ago to a mere couple of hundred now, according to the Iraqi military. Iraqi forces say they expect to reach the Tigris and regain full control over the city by the end of this week. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is expected to visit Mosul to formally declare victory, and a week of nationwide celebrations is planned. Mosul is by far the largest city captured by Islamic State. It was here, nearly three years ago to the day, that it declared the founding of its  caliphate  over parts of Iraq and Syria. With Mosul gone, its territory in Iraq will be limited to areas west and south of the city where some tens of thousands of civilians live.  Victory is very near, only 300 meters separate the security forces from the Tigris,  military spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Rasool told state TV.  Abadi declared the end of Islamic State's  state of falsehood  on Thursday, after the security forces took Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque. It was from here that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made his first and only video appearance, proclaiming himself  caliph  - the ruler of a theocratic Islamic state - on July 4, 2014. Members of Federal Police flash a victory sign during the fight with the Islamic States militants in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq July 3, 2017.Ahmed JadallahSuicide Attacks  With its territory shrinking fast, the group has been stepping up suicide attacks in the parts of Mosul taken by Iraqi forces and elsewhere. On Sunday, a male suicide bomber dressed in a woman's veil killed 14 people and wounded 13 others in a displacement camp west of the capital Baghdad known as Kilo 60, security sources said. Islamic State claimed responsibility. Slideshow (20 Images)“The people who were attacked had fled to Kilo 60 for their safety. Many have traveled huge distances seeking help,  Lise Grande, the United Nations' Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, said in a statement.  Islamic State said on Sunday it had carried out 32 suicide attacks in June in Iraq and 23 in Syria, of which 11 were on the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces attacking its stronghold of Raqqa. Iraqi state television said thousands of people had fled Mosul's densely-populated Old City over the past 24 hours. But thousands more are believed trapped in the area with little food, water or medicine, and are effectively being used as human shields, according to residents who have managed to escape. Months of grinding urban warfare have displaced 900,000 people, about half the city's pre-war population, and killed thousands, according to aid organizations. Baghdadi has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and is believed to be hiding near the Iraq-Syrian border, according to U.S. and Iraqi military sources. The group has moved its remaining command and control structures to Mayadin, in eastern Syria, U.S. intelligence sources have said.

The pan-European STOXX 600  index rose 1.1 percent after ending at two-month lows on Friday, posting its best day in more than 2 months. Only three stock sectors in Europe were in negative territory, while banks were among the biggest gainers with a surge of 2.7 percent. Banks generally benefit from expectations of rising interest rates. JPMorgan said they remained overweight on euro zone banks due to rising government bond yields, but remained bearish on global cyclical plays like autos and capital goods despite their recent poor performance.  The tightening in monetary conditions could pressure valuation multiples near term,  JPMorgan strategist Mislav Matejka said, noting that given the stronger euro, domestic plays should be favored over export oriented stocks. The banking sector index was buoyed by BPER Banca (EMII.MI), Bankia (BKIA.MC) and Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), which all gained more than 4 percent. Carige (CRGI.MI), up nearly 4 percent, was one of the biggest gainers in Italy on the day its board held a crucial meeting to discuss capital plans for the troubled regional lender. The oil & gas index .SXEP, the worst sectoral performer in Europe so far this year, rose nearly 2 percent as the first fall in U.S. drilling activity in a month buoyed oil markets. Shares in oil majors BP (BP.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) rose 1.9 and 2 percent respectively. JPMorgan said energy and mining stocks should be supported by a weaker U.S. dollar. Gains in oil prices also helped boost basic resources firms .SXPP, which jumped 3.2 percent with Glencore (GLEN.L) rising 5 percent.

The annual rainy season, which arrived in the second half of June, has hit southern Hunan province the most. Weather forecasters predict the relentless downpours could start to ease in coming days. Xiangjiang, a major tributary of the Yangtze river, has exceeded its record flood level in the Hunan capital of Changsha. Floods in the city have swamped houses, uprooted trees, damaged cars and submerged roads.  Across Hunan, the flooding has forced hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate, damaged crops and destroyed houses, causing a total direct economic loss of 8.26 billion yuan ($1.22 billion), the provincial civil affairs office said.  In Guangxi, 16 people have been confirmed dead and 10 are missing after a flood hit the southwestern region after a storm, the official Xinhua news agency cited authorities as saying. Southern provinces produce some of China's major crops. Guangxi is China's top sugarcane-growing region, while Hunan is its third-largest hog-farming province. Rice is grown south of the Yangtze.

The FTSE 100 ended the day 0.9 percent higher at 7,377.09 points, recovering from losses last week, and was more or less in line with the broader European market which gained 1.1 percent on the day. Oil companies, which have been the worst-performing sector this year, were lifted by higher crude prices after the first fall in U.S. drilling activity in months alleviated some concerns over a supply glut. Oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell were up 1.9 percent and 1.8 percent respectively.  Having led everyone down for most of the second quarter, crude prices are trending up slightly,  said Ian Williams, economics and strategy analyst at Peel Hunt. HSBC,, Lloyds and Barclays were among top gainers after several central bankers suggested last week that monetary policy could soon start to tighten.  Given the trend in sentiment over the rate outlook, the financials having been calm before that, you would expect them to be moving back to the top of the list again,  said Williams. Glencore,, whose trading arm also benefits from higher crude prices, jumped 5 percent to lead gains among miners, which were also supported by better than expected factory activity data from China. Provident Financial, whose profit warning sent its shares plummeting 18 percent on June 21, was among the top fallers after Liberum analysts said another profit warning for the Home Credit division was likely.  Guidance remains too optimistic, in our view,  they said. Mid caps, however, slipped 0.1 percent with Inmarsat among the biggest fallers. The satellite company dropped 4.7 percent following a report that it faced a court challenge from rivals over its in-flight Wifi service. Among gainers, Electrocomponents drew buying after its first-quarter results impressed with 13 percent growth in revenues. Its shares climbed 3.8 percent, taking its year-to-date gains to around 21 percent. Investors were also readying for second-quarter earnings updates from UK corporates to start streaming in.  The next few weeks will be quite telling. There's still a little bit of upside potential in the overseas earners, and the domestics especially will be interesting to watch given the pressures on the UK consumer,  said Williams.

After a July 1 deadline to restructure the loans passed, the central bank said on Monday the authorities had  moved to a legal procedure for the repossession (of the loans) ... the specific steps of which can not be disclosed now.  PrivatBank was nationalised in December as part of an International Monetary Fund-backed reform to clean up the Ukrainian financial system. Dozens of lenders have closed since a pro-Western government took office in 2014. Wrangling between the state and PrivatBank's former owners over the lender's loan portfolio threatens to complicate the rescue. According to the central bank, risky lending practices left Privatbank with a capital shortfall of over $5.5 billion, and virtually all of its corporate lending had gone to companies linked to its shareholders. One of Ukraine's richest men, who wields considerable political influence, Kolomoisky was PrivatBank's main owner. As part of the rescue, PrivatBank's former shareholders agreed to restructure loans paid to related parties by July 1. Kolomoisky, speaking via a news website he owns, said negotiations over the loans started in June and would go on for as long as necessary for the two sides to reach an agreement.  I can inform that the former owners of PrivatBank, in accordance with their commitments, are taking part in the negotiation process on restructuring their 'loans' with a consortium of companies that received a mandate to represent the interests of the Ministry of Finance and PrivatBank, which was agreed with the International Monetary Fund,  he was quoted as saying. PrivatBank's nationalisation has so far cost taxpayers $4.3 billion, but an Ernst and Young audit of the lender's 2016 annual report showed additional funds worth $1.5 billion are needed to meet capital adequacy requirements. That would be a further burden on Ukraine's already strained public finances and would mean more has been spent on recapitalising PrivatBank since December than the annual defence budget amid a long-running conflict with Russia-backed rebels. Kolomoisky has rejected the central bank's assessment of the health of PrivatBank's loan portfolio and accused the regulator of unfairly targeting the bank. After the deadline passed, the finance ministry said  no significant progress has been made towards restructuring. Instead, we are observing a coordinated legal and media campaign against the interests of the state.

The yield on the region's benchmark bond came within a whisker of 0.50 percent, a level that -- with the exception of one session in mid-March -- was last seen in January 2016. Remarks last week from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that the central bank could make tweaks to its policy to accompany the recent economic recovery triggered the biggest weekly jump in Bund yields since December 2015. The ECB is working on moving away from its ultra-easy monetary policy, Jens Weidmann, head of Germany's Bundesbank and an ECB policymaker, said on Saturday. Data on Monday provided fresh signs that the euro zone economy is gaining momentum. Factories in the bloc rounded off the first half of 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest rate for more than six years, a survey showed. Though the market was generally far more stable on Monday, higher-rated bond yields were flat to a basis point higher on the day. In Germany, the bloc's benchmark issuer, Bund yields touched 0.498 percent before settling at 0.48 percent near the close, up a basis point on the day.  The market reaction last week was very sharp and now is probably the time to digest recent comments,  said Patrick Jacq, European rates strategist at BNP Paribas.  July could be a more supportive month for bonds as there is less supply, but clearly the trend is now upwards for yields.  Bund yields have almost doubled within the space of a week. They could break above 2017 highs at around 0.51 percent soon as investors position for tighter monetary policies globally, analysts said. U.S. Treasury yields rose to six-week highs on Friday as inflation data was not considered weak enough to delay Federal Reserve plans to hike interest rates. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said last week that Britain's central bank was likely to debate a rate increase in coming months, fuelling a sell-off in global debt markets. Comments from Bank of Canada policymakers last week have ramped up market expectations for a rate hike in July and the Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Tuesday, with the focus on whether it will also talk about the need for tighter monetary policy.  Whether we can stabilise this week will depend on the U.S. jobs report,  said Peter Chatwell, head of euro rates strategy at Mizuho, referring to U.S. non-farm payrolls data due on Friday.

Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane set off a political row this month when she called for an overhaul of the bank's mandate - to focus on growth rather than inflation and the currency - rattling investors and hitting the rand hard. The central bank has since filed a court challenge to quash the recommendation. On Friday, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba echoed criticism of the recommendation by parliament and the ruling party, accusing the agency of overstepping the mark.  The Reserve Bank is respected because the people who are leading the institution are acting according to the constitution. I am acting according to the constitution and I am acting independently, without fear, favour and prejudice,  Kganyago said at a public lecture on monetary policy.  It is then for South Africans to say yes, we respect this institution, and when the institution is under attack, they should be able to say: hands off our Reserve Bank.  South Africa is immersed in political rows over President Jacob Zuma's leadership, with the 75-year-old facing calls to resign over various scandals. Zuma denies any wrongdoing. The credit rating of Africa's most industrialised country has been downgraded to  junk  by two of the three biggest rating agencies, the economy has slipped into recession and the unemployment rate is close to 28 percent, a 14-year high. The row over the central bank's mandate has raised fears of further economic turmoil. In an editorial in the Sunday Times newspaper, Kganyago said South Africa risked slipping into a long and painful economic recession if the central bank was forced to abandon its policy of reducing inflation and protecting the currency.

Conversations with six central bank officials from across the euro zone showed they had been unnerved by a rise in the euro and in government bond yields after ECB President Mario Draghi opened the door last week to policy changes. Wary of weakening the economic recovery, some rate setters have become nervous about dropping their long-standing pledge: they will expand or extend the ECB's 2.3 trillion-euro bond-buying program if necessary to bring inflation back to its target of just under 2 percent. Such a change is almost certain to be discussed when the bank meets on July 20. But removing the pledge would probably be taken by the market as a sign the ECB was preparing to wind down the scheme, which has made borrowing cheap and boosted euro zone exports by holding down the value of the euro. Despite declines on Monday, the euro EUR= and German bond yields DE10YT=RR, the debt benchmark for the region, were still far higher than they had been before Draghi's speech. That is an unwelcome development for an ECB seeking to maintain ultra-easy borrowing conditions.  We have to see how the market develops between now and the meeting,  one of the sources said.  I’d say we should err on the side of caution.  A spokesman for the ECB declined to comment. With inflation above 1 percent and the euro zone's economy on its best run for years, officials generally agreed the way was clear for a gradual normalization of ECB policy. They disagreed on the timing, though.  In June, the ECB shut the door to further rate cuts and took a more sanguine view of the economic outlook for the euro zone - thereby removing two so-called 'easing biases' from its policy message. The market took those changes in its stride, so economists expected the rate-setters would soon omit their pledge  to increase the (bond) program in terms of size and/or duration  if necessary. But the officials who spoke to Reuters are no longer sure that will happen at the July 20 meeting.  I was thinking we'd drop the other easing bias in July, but after the market reaction to Draghi's speech I'm less sure about it,  one official said. The head of Germany's Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, said on Saturday that ECB rate setters were discussing moving away from an ultra-easy stance but were still arguing about how expansive policy should be. Another source suggested one solution might be to break up that part of the guidance: take out only the reference to increased purchases or the one to prolong them.  The message could then be amended further in September, when the ECB gets updated inflation forecasts. Those might help the policymakers decide on the future of the program beyond its December end date.

The FSB coordinates financial regulations for the Group of 20 countries (G20) whose leaders meet in Germany this week. The FSB was formed during the crisis that began in 2007 but after an intensive decade of making rules some policymakers now want to prioritize growth over banking regulation. U.S. President Donald Trump has said regulation is holding back lending and the U.S. Treasury has recommended delaying two measures that strengthen bank funding and require lenders to hold more capital for the securities on their trading books. Carney, who is also the governor of the Bank of England, said in a letter to G20 leaders that there had been  immense progress  since the crisis in making banks safer.  G20 reforms have now addressed the fault lines that caused the global financial crisis,  Carney told reporters. Nascent risks remained that needed to be monitored, such as in asset management.  In particular, giving into reform fatigue could erode the willingness of G20 members to rely on each other's systems and institutions and, in the process, fragment pools of funding and liquidity,  Carney said. He said that would mean  less and more expensive  financing for households and businesses, and lower economic growth would be  very likely . Working together through reinforced, voluntary international regulatory cooperation based on agreed global rules would help to avoid this, said Carney. Impact Review The FSB has sought to keep members on board by reviewing new regulations and their impact. Carney said the review showed that higher resilience in the financial system has been achieved,  without impeding the supply of credit to the economy . The FSB will consider whether the leverage ratio, a broad measure of capital to assets, needs a rethink after banks say it stops them from offering derivatives clearing to customers. Besides Washington's misgivings about some reforms, regulators on the Basel Committee are also facing difficulties completing Basel III, a set of tougher capital rules for lenders worldwide. France has said Basel III rules, still to be implemented, would force European lenders to find large amounts of extra capital but Carney called on G20 leaders to urgently help the Committee finish the job.  I think a deal is possible,  Carney said. Carney also said that toxic forms of so-called shadow banking - a sector that provides credit outside the banking system - have now been transformed into  resilient market-based finance . The central banker said once the rules already agreed for shadow banking had been fully implemented there would no need for any more to address existing risks - a conclusion the sector is likely to welcome. The FSB will also convene a high-level roundtable to review whether there were unwarranted barriers that prevent remittance providers from accessing banking services. There has been a decline in correspondent banking as global banks withdraw payments services from rivals in countries deemed at risk from money laundering or terrorism financing, making it harder for diaspora to send money back to their families. A UK scheme to make managers at banks directly accountable for decisions could also be applied globally in some form to tackle misconduct, Carney said. The so-called senior managers regime was introduced in March last year, though some lenders have been skirting the new rules.

The rapid growth in the world's asset management sector since the financial crisis to $75 trillion assets by 2015, or 40 percent of the world's financial assets, has been a largely positive development, Carney told reporters. An issue of concern, however is around  open ended  funds supplying a substantial proportion of cross border flows into developing economies, Carney said. Open-ended refers to a type of fund that can issue and redeem shares at any time. Related CoverageFSB's Carney warns G20 growth at risk from reform fatigueCarney said the concern comes at a time when liquidity, or the ability to sell at short notice to redeem investors, appears better than it is likely to be under stressed conditions.  The question is what will the consequences be when inevitably there is a period of sharp adjustment, reduced liquidity,  Carney said.  What could the knock-on effects be, first and foremost for the economies, but also for the system as a whole. The best in the asset management industry absolutely gets it, and they try to manage those risks.  Earlier this year, the FSB published a set of measures to address risks from such  structural vulnerabilities  in the asset management sector. The watchdog had initially sought to develop a framework for deeming big asset managers  systemically important  like big banks and thereby requiring tougher capital and other requirements. In the face of opposition from markets regulators and the industry, the work was put on ice while focusing on the sector's activities to develop measures that were published in January. Carney said once these measures have been implemented, the FSB will look at whether any  residual  risks remain in the sector that need addressing, such as by deeming the asset management company to be systemic.  The expectation is that the answer will be 'no',  Carney said.  Reporting by Huw Jones, editing by Carolyn Cohn/Keith Weir","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-funds-carney-idUSKBN19O1AX"},

Conversations with six central bank officials from across the euro zone showed they had been unnerved by a rise in the euro and in government bond yields after ECB President Mario Draghi opened the door last week to policy changes. Wary of weakening the economic recovery, some rate setters have become nervous about dropping their long-standing pledge: they will expand or extend the ECB's 2.3 trillion-euro bond-buying program if necessary to bring inflation back to its target of just under 2 percent. Such a change is almost certain to be discussed when the bank meets on July 20. But removing the pledge would probably be taken by the market as a sign the ECB was preparing to wind down the scheme, which has made borrowing cheap and boosted euro zone exports by holding down the value of the euro. Despite declines on Monday, the euro EUR= and German bond yields DE10YT=RR, the debt benchmark for the region, were still far higher than they had been before Draghi's speech. That is an unwelcome development for an ECB seeking to maintain ultra-easy borrowing conditions.  We have to see how the market develops between now and the meeting,  one of the sources said.  I’d say we should err on the side of caution.  A spokesman for the ECB declined to comment. With inflation above 1 percent and the euro zone's economy on its best run for years, officials generally agreed the way was clear for a gradual normalization of ECB policy. They disagreed on the timing, though.  In June, the ECB shut the door to further rate cuts and took a more sanguine view of the economic outlook for the euro zone - thereby removing two so-called 'easing biases' from its policy message. The market took those changes in its stride, so economists expected the rate-setters would soon omit their pledge  to increase the (bond) program in terms of size and/or duration  if necessary. But the officials who spoke to Reuters are no longer sure that will happen at the July 20 meeting.  I was thinking we'd drop the other easing bias in July, but after the market reaction to Draghi's speech I'm less sure about it,  one official said. The head of Germany's Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, said on Saturday that ECB rate setters were discussing moving away from an ultra-easy stance but were still arguing about how expansive policy should be. Another source suggested one solution might be to break up that part of the guidance: take out only the reference to increased purchases or the one to prolong them.  The message could then be amended further in September, when the ECB gets updated inflation forecasts. Those might help the policymakers decide on the future of the program beyond its December end date.

Accounts filed at Companies House showed Formula E Operations Ltd reduced its operating loss to 33.7 million euros ($38.32 million) at end-July 2016, a period covering its second season, from a previous 62.7 million. Net liabilities rose to 107.2 million euros from 72.1 million, while total revenues reached 56.6 million from a previous 19.7 million.  Everything is going according to plan,  Agag, whose city-based series will be racing in New York for the first time on July 15 and 16, told Reuters in an interview at his London offices.  Actually we are doing incredibly well financially according to our plan.   We could have broken even this year but we decided to invest more in marketing and promotion. We decided to add races like the one in New York, which is in year one a race which is costing, we have significant capital expenditure.   It’s really up to us when we want to go to break even or not. We could be in break-even now, we could be in break-even next season but we may decide to invest more in marketing and promotion.  Agag said the shareholders, including John Malone's Liberty Global and Discovery Communications, were supportive of the strategy and the series had attracted more investors, sponsors and car manufacturers. The New York races will be held in Brooklyn's Red hook neighborhood, with lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop with technology partner Qualcomm securing the naming rights. Manufacturer Interest Agag, whose series plays down competition with Liberty Media-owned Formula One, said more carmakers were set to join a series increasingly aligned with their commercial focus.  I think Formula E has become the preferred destination for manufacturers and there are a few reasons for that,  said the Spaniard.  Obviously, one is that it is electric and manufacturers are more and more focusing on electric cars...and we are the only platform really to help them promote that technology and those types of cars.   And second, because of the cost. The cost of the team in Formula E is very moderate.  Whereas top Formula One teams can burn through $300 million a year, as can the likes of Toyota in the World Endurance Championship, the budgets of successful Formula E teams are between 10 and 15 million.  If a manufacturer wants to spend a big amount of money, he can do it in Formula One. He cannot do it in Formula E,  said Agag.  But if he wants to spend a moderate amount of money and be in a technology where they are all pushing, then Formula E is a very good option.  This is why we have now a number of manufacturers and there will be more coming in the near future.  Serial Le Mans winners Audi announced in October that the marque was leaving the World Endurance Championship to shift resources to Formula E. A source at Audi, owned by Volkswagen who are battling to recover from an emissions scandal, said at the time that the move would save the German carmaker nearly 100 million euros per year.  Renault, Citroen's DS brand, BMW, Jaguar and India's Mahindra are already involved in Formula E. Editing by Ed Osmond","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-electric-agag-idUSKBN19O1W1"},

An index of national factory activity tracked by the Institute for Supply Management rose to 57.8 last month, the strongest reading since August 2014, driving U.S. 10-year yields to their highest levels in seven weeks.     The figures allayed some concern over the pace of economic recovery that had left traders skeptical of the Federal Reserve's stated plan of raising U.S. rates once more before the end of 2017 and another three times next year.     A faster policy tightening could dampen the allure of high-yielding emerging market assets, weighing down on the value of their currencies.     The Mexican peso weakened 0.6 percent, tracking currencies from other emerging markets lower. Trading volumes were thin ahead of the U.S. July Fourth holiday on Tuesday.     The Brazilian real, however, was nearly flat. Traders cited soothing fears that a corruption scandal could delay President Michel Temer's agenda of economic structural reforms.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.4 percent as rising prices of iron ore lifted shares of miner Vale SA.     Shares of sewage and water utility Cia de Saneamento de Minas Gerais SA, which are not part of the benchmark index, soared after regulators allowed the Brazilian water and sewage utility to raise tariffs by more than expected.

Slideshow (3 Images)La Provence regional newspaper, which first reported the incident, cited a judicial source as saying police are  not at all treating it as terrorist related  and suspected instead a dispute between youths. The newspaper also cited witnesses as saying that one of two gunmen with their faces covered had fired shots around at 10:30 p.m. as people were coming out of the mosque before the two fled the scene. Four people were wounded outside the mosque while a family of four in their apartment some fifty meters (yards) away took shrapnel, La Provence said.  The incident comes after a man was arrested on Thursday after trying to drive a car into a crowd in front of a mosque in the Paris suburb of Creteil in an incident in which no one was injured.

On 30 June 2017, Unipol announced a plan to spin off about EUR3 billion of Unipol Banca's bad loans, which will be transferred into a separate new company owned by Unipol. The new company will acquire the bad loans portfolio at a price that corresponds to around 20% of its nominal value. Unipol also announced the reorganisation of the group's insurance operations, with the transfer of Unisalute (a health insurance specialist) and Linear (Unipol's direct motor insurer) from Unipol Gruppo to UnipolSai (Unipol's primary insurance subsidiary). Unipol will also exercise the put option on the 50% share in Popolare Vita (the bancassurance joint-venture between UnipolSai and Banco BPM) and exit this bancassurance agreement at end-2017. Fitch's analysis had incorporated the economic impact of the banking unit's restructuring plan. This transaction does not change Fitch's view on Unipol's capitalisation, as the group will ultimately retain the underlying credit risk. However, we note that the restructuring plan crystalises the contingent losses arising from Unipol's banking operations. Unipol's capitalisation could benefit in the future if recovery rates on the bad loans portfolio transferred to the new company were higher than 20%. We expect Unipol's score in Fitch's Prism factor-based capital model to remain 'Strong', after the banking unit's restructuring costs and the exercise of the put option on Popolare Vita's stake are taken into account. However, this is subject to the amount of proceeds that Unipol will receive from Banco BPM, which will be determined on the basis of the shareholders' agreement in force between UnipolSai and Banco BPM. Unipol estimates a consolidated net loss arising from the banking unit's restructuring of about EUR780 million in 2017. We view this loss as a one-off item, as the group will book all the restructuring costs in the current financial year. We expect Unipol's profitability to recover to a level commensurate with the ratings in 2018. Unipol's 2012-2016 average return on equity was 5%. We believe that transfer of Unisalute and Linear to UnipolSai will streamline insurance operations within Unipol, although we do not expect cost synergies from this operation. Fitch also believes that the announced sale of 50% shareholding in Popolare Vita is neutral to Unipol's business profile, as the group will maintain an important presence in the bancassurance arena in Italy through its bancassurance agreement with BPER Banca. Unipol expects to complete all these transactions by end-2017, subject to regulatory approvals.

The RWE reflects heightened probability that the rating may be upgraded, downgraded or affirmed. Fitch understands from management that advanced discussions are taking place that could result in a change of MutRe's ownership structure, which could be positive for the company's credit profile. However, should the discussions not lead to a change in MutRe's ownership the rating is likely to be downgraded. This follows a decline in MutRe's revenue and profitability in 2016, as well as Fitch's expectation that the company's premiums and earnings are unlikely to recover sufficiently over the next two years. We also see uncertainties around MutRe's future strategic direction under this scenario. KEY RATING DRIVERS MutRe's  capital  is  currently held  by three groups of shareholders with 33.33%  each: the  French Federation of Health Mutual Insurers and other mutual companies which hold respectively 18% and  15.34%  of  MutRe's capital;  SCOR Global  Life,  a  core  subsidiary  of  SCOR  S.E. (AA-/Stable) and  MATMUT,  a multi-line  mutual  insurer  operating  in  France. MutRe's current rating reflects standalone characteristics and does not rely on uplift from the ownership structure. The rating reflects MutRe's strong capital position and prudent reserving policies. Offsetting these factors are MutRe's small size, reduced premium income in 2015 and 2016 and low profitability. Rapid consolidation trend and concentration in the French mutual insurer sector following the introduction of Solvency II, as well as lower cessions linked to higher retention rates from mutual insurance companies, have added pressure to MutRe's revenue. This has resulted in premium income falling 24% since 2014, linked to the cancellation of two major contracts in 2016 and the consolidation of ceding companies with lower premiums ceded to MutRe. MutRe's net profit fell 38% in 2016, below Fitch's expectations, and return on equity decreased to 2.1% (2015: 3.5%). This decline, however, includes the impact of non-recurring items, such as litigations involving a ceding company and the tax authorities of France. Fitch expects MutRe's underlying profitability to improve in 2017. The rating remains constrained by the company's small size, limited diversification, and geographical concentration. These characteristics make MutRe more susceptible than larger companies to operational risks and to changes in the operating environment. Fitch views MutRe's capitalisation as strong and supportive of the insurer's rating. The company's regulatory Solvency II ratio was 134% in 2016 without transitional measures. This level is in line with Fitch's expectations and reflects higher capital charges (than under Solvency I) on underwriting risk for certain lines of business with a long duration. Fitch views MutRe's investment strategy as conservative, with the bulk of the insurer's assets invested in high quality fixed-income securities and cash. MutRe's asset allocation is stable over the long-term, and Fitch does not expect any material change in 2017-2018. Assets and liability management (ALM) is prudent, in Fitch's view. RATING SENSITIVITIES A change in MutRe's ownership could be positive for the ratings. The rating is likely to be downgraded if MutRe's ownership does not change, exposing MutRe  to strategic uncertainties.

It is the latest sign of how consumer credit, a key driver of economic growth, has risen up the watchlist of regulators at a time when savings are hitting their lowest levels in at least 50 years and the BoE's policymakers are split over whether to raise rates as inflation climbs. The BoE said last week that a targeted review by its banking supervisory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), had found weaknesses in some aspects of underwriting credit and a reduction in the resilience of banks. On Tuesday, the PRA will make a statement on its first set of specific actions or  expectations  from the banks it regulates regarding credit to consumers. It will look at a wide range of credit, including the financing of car purchases - though banks now account for a much smaller portion of this than in the past.   Effective governance at firms should ensure that risks are priced and managed appropriately and benign conditions do not lead to complacency by lenders,  the BoE said last week in its twice-yearly Financial Stability Report. The BoE noted in the report that losses for banks from consumer loans defaulting are far higher than in the home loans sector, though they remain low overall. At the same time, the amount of capital that banks are setting aside against exposure to consumer credit has fallen since 2014, meaning lenders have less capacity to absorb losses. The BoE also said last week that it was bringing forward to September from November the assessment of stressed losses in consumer credit lending in this year's annual  stress test  of top banks. Last week, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said it was taking a close look at lending practices in the fast growing car financing sector.

The Dow Jones Transport Average index, which includes airlines, railroads and package delivery companies, is often viewed as a barometer of economic activity. The 20-component index eclipsed its March 1 intraday record of 9,639.33, rising as high as 9,672.62 in morning trading. Among the stocks giving the index the biggest lift were tank barge operator Kirby Corp, freight and logistics company Landstar System and package delivery company FedEx Corp . Should the index finish on Monday above its March 1 closing high of 9,593.95, it would be a positive sign for the market's trend, said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.  If people are looking for validation that the economy is still on pretty solid footing and can continue to kind of accelerate, that’s a good sign to see,” said Carlson, a contributing editor to the Dow Theory Forecasts newsletter. Dow Theory tracks the transports and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to confirm major trends in the stock market. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been setting successive record highs over the past six weeks, the transports slumped after March 1 and only recently surged back to record territory. A new closing high for the transports would reconfirm the bull market trend, which  emboldens investors to buy the dips,  said Carlson. The transports' 1.1 percent gain on Monday, a shortened trading day ahead of the July 4 holiday, came on a generally higher day for the broader market. The benchmark S&P; 500 was up 0.5 percent and the Dow industrials gained 0.9 percent, while a decline in the technology sector dragged the Nasdaq Composite lower. The Dow industrials' 8 percent rise in the first six months of the year marked their best first-half performance since 2013.

For years, about 60 percent of AU spending has been financed by donors including the European Union, World Bank and governments of wealthy non-African countries. Mugabe, who has held power in Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980, has said reliance on foreign funds allows big powers to interfere in the work of the AU. The 93-year-old Mugabe told an African Union summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, he had auctioned 300 cattle from his personal herd in May to fulfill a promise made to the continental body two years ago.  Africa needs to finance its own programs. Institutions like the AU cannot rely on donor funding as the model is not sustainable,  Mugabe said in comments broadcast on Zimbabwe's state television.  This humble gesture on Zimbabwe's part has no universal application but it demonstrates what is possible when people apply their minds to tasks before them.  The African Union's 2017 budget is $782 million, increasing from $416.8 million last year. African leaders in July 2016 agreed in principle to charge a 0.2 percent levy on some exports to help finance AU operations. Zimbabwe, whose economy was devastated by a drought last year, does not disclose its contributions to the AU. The top five African contributors are Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Nigeria and South Africa.

There's no doubt the huge potential that creative use of data could have on patient care and clinical improvements, but the price of innovation does not need to be the erosion of fundamental privacy rights,  Elizabeth Denham, head of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), said in a statement.  The data was provided in a medical trial that integrated information from existing systems used by the Royal Free to alert clinicians when signs of deterioration in a patient with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) were found. The investigation found that many patients did not know their data was being used as part of a test.  We accept the ICO's findings and have already made good progress to address the areas where they have concerns,  the trust said in a statement. As a result, the trust has signed a document agreeing to make change to the way it handles data.  Although the ICO's findings related to the hospital, Google's artificial intelligence arm has also taken responsibility, admitting it underestimated the complexity of Britain's state-run National Health Service and the rules around patient data.   We were almost exclusively focused on building tools that nurses and doctors wanted, and thought of our work as technology for clinicians rather than something that needed to be accountable to and shaped by patients, the public and the NHS as a whole,  Google DeepMind said in a statement.

{"news_time":"2017-07-03 11:39:00","news_title":"Central bankers want communication, not coordination","keywords":"Japan,Portugal,Sweden,Switzerland,United Kingdom,Erik Nielsen,Mario Draghi,GLOBAL,ECONOMY/CENBANK,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - There is no behind-the-scenes pact between powerful central bankers to tighten policy but the potent effect their actions have on financial markets means they want a deeper understanding of each others' motivations, officials told Reuters. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi renewed his long-standing wish last week for more talks between global central banks, fuelling suspicions that policymakers discussed more at recent gatherings than they admit. Indeed, the ECB, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and Norway's central bank all turned unexpectedly hawkish in just a matter of days with Sweden and the Reserve Bank of Australia expected to follow suit this week. Coming on the heels of the Bank for International Settlement's annual meeting in Switzerland, where top officials are well shielded from the media, traders and analysts have looked suspiciously at the turn of events. However, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic said they often share their economic views in private but to foster understanding and not to coordinate policy as each central bank acts independently. Banks need to fulfil different mandates with widely different tools and any hint that domestic policy is subjugated to the interest of foreign central banks risks a public relations disaster. This makes policy coordination, let alone cooperation, practically impossible, sources said.  Can you imagine Draghi coming to the Governing Council, or just the board saying: thanks for coming but I've already agreed with Yellen,  a source at a euro zone central bank said.  How quickly would that leak?  While central banks make their own decisions, these still have far reaching consequences for currency, bond and derivatives prices. Therefore policy transparency, the key benefit of private meetings, prepares policymakers for what may be coming, limiting market volatility.  The more we can talk to each other and also communicate to markets in a way that doesn't increase uncertainty, that would be very helpful,  Draghi said last week in Sintra, Portugal, at another gathering of central bankers.  So the need is there, how to do it is not simple.  Some market players seized on that as a new openness by Draghi to coordinate policy with other central banks. Indeed, such cooperation is not unknown. In late 2008, as the global financial crisis was spiralling out of control, banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the ECB and the Swiss National Bank, cut rates in a coordinated move. In 2011, a concerted effort by G7 central banks helped stabilize the Japanese yen after a devastating earthquake. In fact, Draghi's remarks in Sintra only echo a call he made a year ago for more dialogue to limit the market volatility related to the varying pace of the recovery across major economies. Picking Up Speed A source familiar with the Fed's thinking also poured cold water on the idea of a pact. Given heightened scrutiny from Congress, any suggestion that the central bank subjugates policy to secret deals with overseas banks would seriously damage the institution's standing, the source added.  We can't reveal any information that is not already in the public domain so we explain our thinking, share our analysis, but can't discuss our next step,  the source said. Private meetings are often more technical and more detailed given that they are made to an expert audience and they allow for frank discussion that may not be appropriate in public, the sources added.  But I've never heard Yellen or Carney discuss anything that has not already been said in one form or another before,  said a European official, who has attended such closed door meetings in the past. Yet the shift in the banks' tone is no coincidence, the officials say. The recovery is picking up speed and seems to be solidifying, a conclusion made in various financial centres. And taking a more upbeat stance in public becomes easier when others are also changing their tone, as the risk of a market volatility diminishes, the sources said. But the differences between how central banks operate are also huge. The Fed has to reconcile an inflation and employment mandate while the ECB needs to worry about a discordant currency union that came to the brink of collapse in recent years. And while the Bank of Japan is also seeing some progress, policymakers are keen to say that they are far from tightening policy.  I'm 99 percent sure that no such pact has been agreed – but there is indeed broad common agreement that the world (ex-UK) is looking a whole lot better than they thought just six months ago,  UniCredit economist Erik Nielsen said.

The Royal Free NHS Trust failed to comply with the Data Protection Act when it passed on personal information of around 1.6 million patients to Google's DeepMind.   There's no doubt the huge potential that creative use of data could have on patient care and clinical improvements, but the price of innovation does not need to be the erosion of fundamental privacy rights,  Elizabeth Denham, head of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), said in a statement.  The data was provided in a medical trial that integrated information from existing systems used by the Royal Free to alert clinicians when signs of deterioration in a patient with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) were found. The investigation found that many patients did not know their data was being used as part of a test.  We accept the ICO's findings and have already made good progress to address the areas where they have concerns,  the trust said in a statement. As a result, the trust has signed a document agreeing to make change to the way it handles data.  Although the ICO's findings related to the hospital, Google's artificial intelligence arm has also taken responsibility, admitting it underestimated the complexity of Britain's state-run National Health Service and the rules around patient data.   We were almost exclusively focused on building tools that nurses and doctors wanted, and thought of our work as technology for clinicians rather than something that needed to be accountable to and shaped by patients, the public and the NHS as a whole,  Google DeepMind said in a statement.

It just seemed difficult to look after the animals for two to three years and get to really know them, and then send them to slaughter. It felt as if you were betraying them , Wilde told the BBC. Wilde believes that his cows have emotions and can sense when they're going to be killed.

A New Jersey newspaper captured photos of the governor and his family enjoying the empty beach on Sunday, just hours before he donned a suit and tie and boarded a helicopter to fly to Trenton, the state capital, to discuss stalled shutdown negotiations with reporters. Budget impasses have caused partial government shutdowns in New Jersey and in Maine, leading to the suspension of many nonessential services. New Jersey's state parks closed on Saturday, forcing many to alter their holiday weekend plans. More than 30,000 state workers were on furlough on Monday. Maine's state police, parks and offices responsible for collecting revenue all planned to work through the shutdown there. But the majority of its 12,000 state employees will be furloughed. Christie, already the least popular governor in modern New Jersey history before the photos were published, defended his beach time in a phone call to a morning TV show on Monday. When the host said he could understand why people were upset he was on a beach closed to the public, Christie responded,  Well, I'm sorry, they're not the governor.  Christie, a former Republican presidential candidate who is in the last year of his second and final term running the state, was staying with his family at a governor's residence at Island Beach State Park. He is fighting New Jersey lawmakers over a controversial bill that he says must be passed alongside the state's budget. The budget itself has been passed by committees in both houses, but Christie says he will strike out hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for schools and other key services if the Democrat-led Assembly does not vote on a separate bill to restructure the state's largest health insurer. That threat was enough to prevent Democratic Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto from getting enough votes to pass the budget on Friday, triggering the shutdown. All 80 members of New Jersey's Assembly are up for re-election in November. Prieto left the vote open over the weekend, and one vote switched from  abstain  to  yes , but the Assembly is still 13 short of the votes needed to pass the budget. Christie said at a news conference on Sunday that he was open to hearing other proposals from Democrats but he expected the shutdown would likely continue through the July Fourth holiday. At that same news conference, before the photos were published, Christie said he did not get any sun this weekend. His spokesman later clarified that was because the governor was wearing a baseball hat.

(Reuters) - The threat posed by North Korea was a key topic in phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of China and Japan, along with trade issues, the White House said on Sunday. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ahead of expected meetings with the leaders of Asia's two biggest economies at a Group of 20 nations summit in Germany later this week.       Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula,  the White House said of Trump's call with Xi from his resort property in Bridgewater, New Jersey, where he is spending a long weekend.  President Trump reiterated his determination to seek more balanced trade relations with America’s trading partners,  it added. Trump has become increasingly frustrated with China's inability to rein in North Korea, and the reference to trade was an indication the one-time New York businessman may be ready to return to his tougher-talking ways on business with Beijing after holding back in hopes it would put more pressure on Pyongyang. Trump and Xi discussed the  peace and stability of the Korean peninsula , China's Foreign Ministry said, without elaborating. Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang later told a daily briefing that the United States was  very clear  about China's position on North Korea. Geng did not elaborate on what Xi told Trump about North Korea. Related CoverageSouth Korea's Moon says North Korea has chance to talk Negative factors  have affected Sino-U.S. relations, and China has already expressed its position to the United States, Xi told Trump, according to a read-out of a telephone call between the leaders carried by the ministry. One China Policy The ministry said Trump told Xi the U.S. government would continue to follow a  one China  policy, under which Washington acknowledges the Chinese position that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it, and that this position had not changed. China pays great attention to that reiteration and hopes the United States can  appropriately handle  the Taiwan issue, Xi told Trump, according to the ministry.

And on Sunday a U.S. warship sailed near a disputed island in the South China Sea claimed by China, drawing a rebuke from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Trump’s separate conversations with the two Asian leaders followed White House talks with South Korea’s new president, Moon Jae-in, last week in which the U.S. leader called on Asian powers to implement sanctions and demand North Korea  choose a better path and do it quickly.      Trilateral Summit FILE PHOTO: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (L) looks on as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a joint press conference at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 10, 2017.Jim BourgTrump and Abe, in their call, reiterated their commitment to increase pressure on North Korea.  They reaffirmed that the United States-Japan Alliance stands ready to defend and respond to any threat or action taken by North Korea,  the White House said in a statement.  Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference the two countries and South Korea will have a trilateral summit at the G20 meeting, but he didn’t want to speculate on what might be said there.  “It’s important for these three nations to show their strong unity and cooperation both within and without,  Suga said.   Things such as strengthening pressure on North Korea or urging China to fulfill even more of a role. Things like this have been agreed on before as well.”   Trump, who held talks with Abe earlier this year at the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, has forged a united front with the Japanese leader on the need to exert pressure on North Korea to curb its nuclear and missile development.  During and after a Florida summit with Xi in April at Mar-a-Lago, Trump praised his Chinese counterpart for agreeing to work on the North Korea issue and has held back on attacking Chinese trade practices he railed against during the presidential campaign. But Trump has recently suggested he was running out of patience with China's modest steps to pressure North Korea, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States, and has been considering moving ahead on trade actions. Trump has been weighing new quotas or tariffs on steel imports for national security reasons and plans to discuss his concerns at the G20. Washington sees excess global production capacity, particularly in China, administration officials say.

Utilities have denied overcharging, but last year the Competition and Markets Authority found that British households overpaid a total of 1.4 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) a year on average from 2012 to 2015 because of uncompetitive standard energy tariffs. Ofgem would consult with consumer groups over the potential changes and vulnerable customers could cover around 2 million consumers already on discounts to help them heat their homes, a spokeswoman for the regulator said on Monday.  I welcome this initial proposal, it's a step in the right direction, but I will wait to see the actual proposals and to see them turned into action to cut bills,  business minister Greg Clark told parliament. He said the government would be prepared to introduce new laws if the regulator's changes did not do enough to stop customers overpaying. The proposals are likely to have a limited impact on Britain's dominant big six energy suppliers who have around 85 percent of the market. Energy prices became an issue in last month's national election with the threat of a broader cap in standard variable tariffs hanging over the industry.  Today's announcement from Ofgem is positive as the direction of travel from the regulator is measured and pragmatic and would also satisfy the Tory manifesto commitments of extending a cap to more vulnerable customers on poorest value tariffs,  analysts at Bernstein said. The opposition Labour Party, which has campaigned for a broad price cap, said the proposals were  watered down  and did not meet the Conservatives' election promises. Shares in British Gas owner Centrica, Britain's largest energy provider, were up 1.2 percent at 0810 GMT, outpacing Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 index, which was up less than 0.5 pct. Britain's other  Big Six  suppliers are SSE, Iberdrola's Scottish Power, Innogy's npower, E.ON and EDF Energy. Under the existing  warm homes discount , energy suppliers give a rebate to customers who are considered  fuel poor , which means their household income would fall below the poverty line once the amount needed to adequately heat and power their home is spent. Ofgem also said it would seek to make switching energy supplier easier, by allowing people to switch directly by using comparison websites. It would also trial its own online switching service to help customers who have been on the same poor value tariffs for three or more years. Under the plans, the cost of installing pre-pay meters would be capped at 150 pounds ($195), another move designed to help poorer customers.  We are committed to ensuring that the more disadvantaged in society are not left behind as we move towards a smarter, more competitive energy market,  Ofgem Chief Executive Dermot Nolan said in a statement.

The coast guard asked for the ship to be docked at the port at Rhodes immediately, and we did not accept this. They wanted to check (the ship), and we didn't accept that,  he told the broadcaster.  They said they would fire if we didn't stop, they did what they said.  Kalkavan did not say why he didn't want the ship to be inspected. He said there was no risk of water intake from the bullet holes. An official from the Greek shipping ministry confirmed that the coast guard tried to inspect the ship's cargo, adding that the vessel did not cooperate and then moved back to Turkish waters. The official did not comment on whether the coast guard opened fire. The Greek coast guard declined to comment. Broadcaster NTV reported that two ships belonging to the Turkish coast guard were at the scene, and it quoted Turkey's foreign ministry as saying it was in contact with the relevant authorities. Kalkavan confirmed the ship, which had set off from Turkey's southeastern city of Iskenderun near Turkey's Syrian border, had returned to Turkish waters.

The greenback just came off its worst quarter since 2010 last week as overseas central banks have signalled they are considering whether to begin reducing monetary stimulus in light of evidence their local economies are doing better.

So far the data are going central banks' way,  said Steven Englander, head of research and strategy at Rafiki Capital Management in New York.     Earlier Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 57.8 last month, the highest reading since August 2014.     This upbeat factory report propelled benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to 2.346 percent, the highest in nearly seven weeks, Reuters data showed.      A closely watched index that tracks the dollar against six major currencies was 0.6 percent at 96.192, rebounding from its lowest level since early October seen on Friday.     The dollar index shed 4.71 percent in the second quarter, its steepest quarterly loss since the 8.49 percent drop in third quarter of 2010.     The greenback climbed to a six-week high against the yen at 113.37 yen. It was last up 0.9 percent at 113.34 yen.     The euro retreated from its highest in more than a year against the dollar last week. It was last down 0.5 percent at $1.1369.     Currency trading activity was muted ahead of the U.S. July Fourth holiday. U.S. financial markets will close early on Monday and will be shut on Tuesday.

Any shift in the wording of the Reserve Bank of Australia's statement, also early on Tuesday, may also support the Aussie , which was 0.6 percent below Friday's close at $0.7645. ========================================================     Currency bid prices at 11:21AM (1521 GMT)  Description      RIC      Last      U.S. Close  Pct       YTD Pct     High Bid    Low Bid                                       Previous   Change     Change                                                        Session                                        Euro/Dollar      EUR=     $1.1364   $1.1423     -0.52%    +0.00%      +1.1427     +1.1358  Dollar/Yen       JPY=     113.3700  112.3500    +0.91%    -2.99%      +113.4200   +111.9500  Euro/Yen         EURJPY=  128.83    128.40      +0.33%    +4.62%      +128.8900   +127.8700  Dollar/Swiss     CHF=     0.9632    0.9581      +0.53%    -5.36%      +0.9635     +0.9583  Sterling/Dollar  GBP=     1.2934    1.3025      -0.70%    +4.85%      +1.3023     +1.2932  Dollar/Canadian  CAD=     1.2998    1.2962      +0.28%    +0.00%      +1.3007     +1.2965  Australian/Doll  AUD=     0.7645    0.7686      -0.53%    +5.96%      +0.7695     +0.7645  ar                                                                                  Euro/Swiss       EURCHF=  1.0944    1.0949      -0.05%    +0.00%      +1.0956     +1.0923  Euro/Sterling    EURGBP=  0.8785    0.8769      +0.18%    +0.00%      +0.8790     +0.8757  NZ               NZD=     0.7276    0.7332      -0.76%    +0.00%      +0.7345     +0.7274  Dollar/Dollar                                                                       Dollar/Norway    NOK=     8.3610    8.3454      +0.19%    -3.20%      +8.3705     +8.3362  Euro/Norway      EURNOK=  9.5021    9.5349      -0.34%    +0.00%      +9.5348     +9.4909  Dollar/Sweden    SEK=     8.4802    8.4274      +0.06%    +0.00%      +8.4850     +8.4172  Euro/Sweden      EURSEK=  9.6375    9.6316      +0.06%    +0.60%      +9.6468     +9.6129                    (Additional reporting by Patrick Graham; in London; Editing by Susan Thomas and Grant McCool)       ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex-idUSL8N1JU2YX"},

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity rose to 57.8 last month from 54.9 in May. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 55.2.     The expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for roughly 12 percent of the overall U.S. economy, combined with hawkish comments last week from the heads of the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, pressured yields higher.      Analysts also said traders were selling Treasuries in anticipation of Friday's U.S. June employment report, which could push yields higher if jobs and wage growth beat expectations.       The remarks from last week from central bankers and the ISM data from today help continue to pressure rates higher, and if we do get a solid number on Friday, that could keep the sell-off going,  said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.     Short-dated U.S. Treasury yields, which are considered most sensitive to Fed rate policy, surged. Two-year yields touched 1.422 percent to mark their highest since early June 2009, while three-year yields touched their highest in more than three months of 1.593 percent.      Benchmark 10-year yields hit a nearly seven-week high of 2.345 percent, while 30-year yields touched their highest in nearly three weeks of 2.869 percent. Five- and seven-year yields hit their highest since early May of 1.937 percent and 2.191 percent.      Analysts said trading volume was thin, with the U.S. bond market closing early at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) ahead of the July 4 Independence Day holiday.      (The manufacturing data) reinforces the risk of a tighter Fed,  said Bruno Braizinha, interest rates strategist at Societe Generale in New York.     Braizinha added that since expectations of another rate hike from the Fed had bottomed out in recent sessions, there was a greater risk of traders pricing in higher expectations of another Fed rate hike this year if Friday's employment report beats expectations.      A raft of weak U.S. economic data, including soft inflation readings, had reduced expectations of another rate rise in recent weeks.

Since Trump was elected U.S. president, Russian has been keenly anticipating his first meeting with Putin, hoping it would trigger a reset in U.S.-Russia relations that plunged to post-Cold War lows under Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. But with Trump embroiled in a row at home over his associates' links to Moscow, the encounter with Putin has become a minefield. Too warm a meeting would allow Trump's domestic opponents to accuse him of being a Kremlin stooge. Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters the Trump-Putin meeting would happen on the sidelines of the G20 summit, in Hamburg, but it was not yet finalised how it would fit into the summit's schedule.  We will be looking for certain breaks, windows to hold this, the most important, meeting,  Ushakov said.  We have a lot of issues, which should be discussed at the highest level ... That's why this meeting, this first personal contact, is so important.  Asked about the agenda for the meeting, Ushakov said:  I've heard the Americans want to raise the issues of terrorism and Syria. It seems to me that would be pretty reasonable.  Ushakov said that ties between Russia and the United States were at  zero level.  The Kremlin aide urged the United States  to save us from the need to retaliate  against Washington for expelling Russian diplomats and seizing two Russian diplomatic compounds on U.S. soil, one in Maryland and the other on Long Island. Barack Obama ordered the expulsion of the 35 Russians in late December last year, seized the compounds, and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies over what he said was their involvement in hacking political groups in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Russian has denied interfering in the U.S. election. Putin said at the time he would not retaliate immediately, in the expectation that relations would improve under Trump. With no thaw materializing yet, Russian officials have said this month that they may now have to take  symmetrical  steps in retaliation.

Tsonga, the 12th seed, was dumped out in the second round last year but was never forced out of second gear as he swatted Norrie aside on Court Two, exposing all the Briton's inexperience. For Tsonga, it was an opportunity to find some rhythm on grass having played only two matches at Queen's after losing in the first round of the French Open.  He had some sympathy for his battered opponent, who had previously claimed only one tour-level match victory at Eastbourne last week. Related CoverageNorrie flies the flag for plucky British losers I know how difficult it is to come for the first time to these kind of tournaments against a guy who is supposed to be a lot better than you. It's not easy,  Tsonga told reporters.  There were few areas of the game where Norrie had been able to compete against Tsonga, who did not face a break point in the match.

Tsonga had begun in his usual languid fashion before cranking up the pressure to break twice and take the first set against the South African-born Norrie.  Slideshow (2 Images)While Norrie had weapons, principally a decent serve and a whip-crack forehand, they were all too often firing off target, allowing Tsonga to move through the gears at key moments.  The match became increasingly one-sided in the second set as Norrie double-faulted to hand Tsonga a break in the sixth game before tamely netting a backhand to fall two sets behind.  Tsonga broke twice again in the third set to wrap up victory in one hour and 23 minutes, disappearing swiftly off court after saluting the British crowd, who had been given few opportunities to cheer the young home hope.  Despite the manner of his defeat, however, Norrie remained resolutely upbeat, telling reporters he had  enjoyed every moment of it .

Norrie was anything but chastened by his 6-3 6-2 6-2 defeat at the hands of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga as he smiled his way through surely one of the most upbeat news conferences ever given by a first-round loser.  It was such a great experience playing someone like Tsonga,   said the 21-year-old wildcard.  I started well but he didn't really give me a chance to get into the match with his serve. I just wish I could have played and returned a little bit better, but it was all good.  Not too many objective observers would have opted for  all good  to describe his 30 unforced errors in a match where he never remotely threatened so much as a break point. Norrie, however, refused to don the sackcloth and ashes.  He played good, and I was happy with the way I played,  he insisted.  I enjoyed every moment of it.  I tried my hardest and there's nothing more I can do. I'm proud of myself,  he added, to no doubt leave his former coaches at Norrie's Texas Christian University gnashing their teeth.  Likewise, the idea of the famously focused Murray ever  enjoying every moment  of a such a demolition job seems laughable. Norrie is no joke player, however. He was the top-ranked performer on the United States college circuit and took his Wimbledon wildcard on the back of his first tour-level victory at Eastbourne last month. But the step up on Monday was far too steep for a player appearing in his first grand slam match against a man in his 150th and twice a Wimbledon semi-finalist.  I think I just lost a little bit of focus,  he said.  I missed a few easy volleys in the first set, got broken. I played one loose service game in each set and it cost me. I'm not used to playing guys at this level.  I think I matched him pretty well. The whole match was just his serve, and he stayed focused and on it the whole match. He didn't give me anything. But it's a good learning experience.  Editing by Ed Osmond","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-wimbledon-norrie-idUSKBN19O1T0"},

Goldman Sachs and Chevron gave the biggest boost to the Dow, while JPMorgan and Exxon helped lift the broader S&P; 500 index. Nine of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, topped by the energy index's 1.38 percent rise. Oil resumed its longest stretch of daily rallies in more than five years after data pointed to moderating U.S. output, pushing energy names higher. However, a fall in Facebook, Comcast and Nvidia weighed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Trading volume is expected to be light on Monday, with the U.S. market closing early at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT). It will be shut on Tuesday for Independence Day. At 11:09 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 183.19 points, or 0.86 percent, at 21,532.82, slightly easing from its all-time high of 21548.84.

Helping sentiment was data that showed U.S. factory activity jumped in June, suggesting economic growth in the second quarter gained some steam, while construction spending held steady in May. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 57.8 last month from 54.9 in May.  Manufacturing PMI's are a good gauge of economic growth and have risen materially in the last year,  said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede.  Coupled with the ambitious balance sheet reduction plan, monetary policy tightening could prove a larger headwind than anticipated.

Oil prices resumed their longest stretch of daily gains in more than five years after data pointed to moderating U.S. crude output, though analysts said news of rising OPEC production could cap the rally.

U.S. stock trading volume was expected to be light, with an early close at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT) ahead of Tuesday's Independence Day holiday when the market will be shut. Investors were getting used to the idea that central banks including the European Central Bank could move away from stimulus measures such as massive bond purchases and ultra-low interest rates.  It's a bit of a relief from last week. There was a bit of a scare from people who felt central banks around the world are more hawkish,  said Nathan Thooft, senior managing director at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.  People are realizing that even if they move quicker than they expected there's not going to be a dramatic shift. Today is a little more of a calmer market that's saying we can get through these hawkish dynamics.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 1 percent and on track for its biggest one-day percentage rise since April 24 after posting its biggest weekly loss since early November. For June it had its steepest monthly loss in a year. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, gained 0.5 percent. The dollar hit session highs after a private index on June domestic manufacturing activity rose more than expected and government data showed U.S. construction spending remained flat in May but government outlays on construction projects were the highest in more than four years.  There's nothing in the economic data that suggests things are too hot. At the same time it's not too cold either,  said Thooft. U.S. 2-year Treasury yields touched a more than 8-year high of 1.41 percent, and yields on Treasuries maturing between three and seven years touched their highest since early May after the data. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields hit a high of 2.33 percent and last stood at 2.31 percent. U.S. crude oil futures were up 1.4 percent at $46.70 while Brent crude  rose 1.2 percent to $49.36 a barrel after data showed moderating U.S. output. MSCI'S all world index rose 0.4 percent, more than erasing the previous session's losses.

Etisalat Nigeria is the biggest foreign-owned victim of dollar shortages plaguing the country due to lower oil prices and economic recession, leaving the company struggling to make repayments to lenders and suppliers. Abu Dhabi state investment fund Mubadala, which had a 40 percent stake in Etisalat Nigeria, pulled out of the country's fourth-largest mobile operator by market share after it failed to restructure the loan with Nigerian banks, the central bank said in June. The sources said the lenders had retained Etisalat Nigeria Chief Executive Matthew Wilshire but that talks continued on the use of the brand. Wilshire told Reuters by phone that he was in the office on Monday and that his contract was with the Nigerian firm. Talks of Mubadala leaving Nigeria started last year, one of the sources said, adding that the fund and parent company United Arab Emirates' Etisalat had been unhappy with the performance of the Nigerian business.  Hakeem had been negotiating hard ... but ... it wasn't the optimal solution so he had to resign,  the source said. The lenders initiated changes in Etisalat Nigeria's shareholding structure last month. Etisalat said it was carrying its 45 percent stake at nil value.  The biggest mistake the company made was taking a loan in dollars,  one of the company sources told Reuters.  It sounded like a good idea at first.  Rival MTN, Nigeria's biggest telecoms firm, had been sourcing loans in dollars but decided to switch to naira, one of the sources, who had worked for the South African firm, said. In 2015 Etisalat started to cut down dollar payments but it was late, the sources said. It restructured its business, slashed jobs and sold off its towers to IHS Towers, the mobile phone tower managers, and leased them back but also linked payments to dollars. The original loan was a seven-year facility to refinance a $650 million loan and fund expansion of Etisalat Nigeria's network. The company missed payments in February after sharp falls in the Nigerian naira bloated the loan's value, making repayments difficult. A former Etisalat employee said the telecoms firm had contracted global accountancy firm PwC to manage staff salary payments for the past three months. Nigerian regulators have said they want to protect Etisalat's 4,000 workers and would hold talks with lenders and IHS Towers as well as other suppliers. They tried to prevent lenders placing the telecoms firm in receivership in March to avoid a wider debt crisis. Etisalat Nigeria has a 14-percent market share in the country's mobile market, behind MTN with 47 percent, Globacom with 20 percent and Airtel - a subsidiary of India's Bharti Airtel - 19 percent.

Michael Lemmon, a former University of Utah finance professor and a senior researcher within BlackRock's quantitative Scientific Active Equity unit, left for Citadel LLC, a spokeswoman for Ken Griffin's hedge fund confirmed. Paddy McCrudden, a former Australia-based portfolio manager and mathematician who was most recently a senior strategist for BlackRock's quant unit in New York, also left the company, BlackRock confirmed. Both former employees hold PhDs and were managing directors at BlackRock. Both declined to comment. A BlackRock spokeswoman confirmed the departures but declined to comment further. In March, BlackRock announced a major overhaul of its actively managed equities business, cutting jobs, dropping fees and relying more on computers to help pick stocks. The move handed over more assets and prominence to BlackRock's high-performing Scientific Active Equity group, based primarily in San Francisco, that uses rigorous quantitative analysis of data to generate investment ideas. The project also dramatically increases the budget for a team focused on data analysis. The strategy, internally code-named  Monarch,  is designed to jumpstart BlackRock's stock funds business, which has delivered mixed performance overall. Over five years, 90 percent of assets run by the Scientific team were beating their benchmark, according to data BlackRock reported to shareholders at the end of March. That compares to 49 percent of assets run by BlackRock's traditionalist  Fundamental  team. BlackRock will update those figures on July 17 when it reports second-quarter earnings. The asset management business is being reordered by a move from funds in which managers pick promising individual stocks to lower-cost index funds that own the entire market. Lemmon co-authored a  Financial Analysts Journal  article last year that argued that asset managers that charge high fees and struggle to justify their value face  extinction  as they compete both with fairly simple quant portfolios and highly sophisticated investors. BlackRock is a major provider of index funds through its iShares business and has seen its stock market value swell to record levels even as many of its competitors languish. BlackRock managed $5.4 trillion on March 31, with $286 billion in active equities. In all, actively managed funds represent nearly a third of BlackRock's assets but an outsized near-50 percent of its fees.

In Maine, a bipartisan budget committee met in Augusta in hopes of breaking a stalemate between Republican Governor Paul LePage and Democratic lawmakers. The shutdown came after LePage threatened to veto a compromise reached by lawmakers in the state's $7.055 billion, two-year budget. At New Jersey’s statehouse in Trenton, there was little evidence of progress in resolving a fight over a health insurance bill that Republican Governor Chris Christie said must be passed alongside the state’s budget.  Maine state police, parks and all offices responsible for collecting revenue planned to operate during the shutdown, the state's first since 1991, but the majority of 12,000 state employees will be furloughed. New Jersey residents were not so lucky. With the July 4 holiday weekend in full swing, the shutdown there included the closure of Island State Beach Park, one of New Jersey’s few free public beaches, and all other state parks.  Although he beach park was closed to the public, Christie took a state helicopter on Saturday to a gubernatorial residence there to be with family and said he would go back on Sunday night.   That's just the way it goes. Run for governor, and you have can have a residence there,  he said when pressed on the issue.  At a news conference on Sunday afternoon, the governor said he had not spoken since Friday to Democratic holdouts.  The impasse could mean a furlough for 30,000 to 35,000 state employees on Monday. In Maine, the stalled budget proposal would have repealed a measure voters approved in November for a 3 percent income tax hike on residents earning more than $200,000 a year. It also contained a 1.5 percent increase in the lodging tax, while increasing funding for public education by $162 million. A New Jersey State Park Police officer informs people that Liberty State Park is closed during a partial state government shutdown in Jersey City, New Jersey U.S., July 3, 2017.Brendan McDermidLePage has promised to veto any spending plan that raises taxes. A six-member bipartisan House-Senate budget panel huddled into the evening on Sunday seeking to reach a deal that would win the two-thirds vote needed for passage of an emergency budget bill in both legislative chambers. Mary-Erin Casale, a spokeswoman for Democratic House Speaker Sara Gideon, said a new compromise could be ready for a vote as early as Monday morning, about the time state employees planned to protest the shutdown at the capitol. A spokeswoman for the governor could not be reached for comment on Sunday. Slideshow (5 Images)Health Insurance Stalemate At the center of New Jersey's stalemate was a plan by Christie to shake up the state’s largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, which he said lacked sufficient transparency and spent too much on salaries.  He threatened to cut $150 million in school funding and other items unless lawmakers adopt his proposal, which would redirect some of Horizon's reserves to drug addiction treatment and other services. Christie offered to hear Democrats' proposals for breaking the impasse, saying: “It should end today,” but acknowledged a settlement was unlikely so soon. Christie, a former presidential contender whose reputation was tarnished by the Bridgegate traffic scandal involving some of his closest aides, ranks as the least popular governor in state history. He is in his second and final term. Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto and other Democrats have criticized the Horizon bill as “bad public policy,” insisting that it be considered after the budget is passed. Christie blamed Prieto for the shutdown and vowed on Sunday to stand by the Horizon bill, saying: “I got elected by a lot more people than Vinnie Prieto did.” Reporting by Elinor Comley in Atlantic City, N.J., and Chris Kenning in Chicago; Editing by Frank McGurty and and Peter Cooney","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shutdowns-idUSKBN19N0RO"},

The $5 billion tax package, which passed in a 72-45 vote and drew an immediate veto threat from Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, would boost the personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent from 3.75 percent and the corporate rate to 7 percent from 5.25 percent. It would also close tax loopholes and expand tax credits. The spending plan won passage in a 81-34 vote. Both bills now head to the Democratic-led Senate, which returns to session on Monday, for concurrence votes. The country's fifth most populous state began an unprecedented third-straight fiscal year on Saturday without a complete budget. A fiscal stalemate between Illinois' governor and Democrats who control the legislature has pounded the state's credit ratings to a step above junk and ballooned its unpaid bill backlog to $15 billion. The pair of decisive House votes set Democrats on a collision course with Rauner, who vowed to veto the 32 percent personal income tax hike he pinned to House Speaker Michael Madigan.  “The legislature could have passed a no reform budget like this one two years ago,” Rauner said in a statement. “Instead, they allowed Mike Madigan to play his political games, passed phony budgets, racked up our debt and inflicted pain on the most vulnerable.” Rauner has insisted for two years that a budget be coupled with a property tax freeze and legislative term limits, among other things. In order for Rauner to match his tough words with results, he will have to persuade at least two of the 15 House Republicans to switch their yes votes in favor of the tax hike legislation. The measure passed the House with one more vote than the threshold necessary to override a gubernatorial veto. In his own statement after the votes, Madigan praised how Republicans and Democrats together took a “crucial step toward reaching a compromise that ends the budget crisis by passing a fully funded state budget in a bipartisan way.” 'Bring This Madness to an End' The tax legislation would give the state a revenue boost to support a full-year budget and start paying down the bill pile that was on track to grow even larger after a federal judge on Friday ordered increased payments on Medicaid provider bills. In giving Democratic supporters the narrow margin to move the legislation to the state Senate, some House Republicans shed tears during debate, predicted their tax votes could topple them politically in next year's elections and delivered a pointed challenge to Rauner to set aside his budgetary preconditions and do what was right for the state’s fiscal health.  I say to the governor, if these bills pass the House and Senate, the revenue bill and expenditure bill, we will have sent you a balanced budget. Have the courage to do what is right and sign the bills,” said State Representative David Harris, who was among 15 Republicans to side with Democrats.  Bring this madness to an end.  Their defiance came after House Republican Leader Jim Durkin, a Rauner ally, noted the deal was not negotiated with the governor and did not represent “an exercise in good faith,” given that negotiations involving some of the governor’s non-budgetary priorities were shunted to the sidelines.

At the time, private media reported that dos Santos, Angola's leader of the last 38 years, had suffered a stroke, although the government has declined to comment on his condition. It did not say when he was scheduled to return from his latest trip. Dos Santos, a Soviet-trained oil engineer and veteran of the guerrilla war against Portuguese rule, has presided over an economic boom in Africa's second-biggest oil producer since the end of a long civil war in 2002. Several private media outlets said in May he was seriously ill. The government only confirmed the medical nature of his trip after sustained demands for information from the opposition UNITA party. The southern African nation of 23 million people is due to hold a general election on Aug. 23 that is likely to see dos Santos replaced as state president by defense minister Joao Lorenco, 63. However, dos Santos will remain leader of the ruling MPLA party, a position that many Angolans believe will allow him to exert considerable political influence behind the scenes should his health permit.

The new company, to be called  Baker Hughes, a GE company,  will begin trading on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker  BHGE.  With headquarters in London and Houston, the combined company will have roughly $23 billion in annual revenue and offer oilfield gear including blowout preventers, pumps, drilling, chemicals, other products and services for oil producers in 120 countries.  For Baker Hughes, the deal helps it grow in size and become an even-more important player in the industry after antitrust concerns scuttled a tie-up last year with rival Halliburton Co. The GE deal vaults the merged business past Halliburton to rival only Schlumberger NV for dominance in the global oilfield service market. For GE, the deal will help it focus more on the oil and gas sector, especially in North America, while shielding the parent company's earnings from the energy industry's boom and bust cycles. All of GE's oil and gas-related businesses will be folded into the new company, which will be 62.5 percent owned by GE. Baker shareholders will own the rest and receive a one-time, $17.50 dividend.    The deal, when announced last autumn, was predicated on a recovery in the oil price to $60 per barrel by 2019, an increase that now seems less likely with a glut of crude still circling the globe and keeping prices below $50.

The crystal ball for all of us is cloudy,  said Lorenzo Simonelli, the company's chief executive, who will relocate to Houston from London.  But we know energy requirements are still going to increase, globally. The fundamentals are there for energy.  Analysts and investors generally praised the deal as data analytics and other high-technology operations grow in demand among oil producers.  The GE-Baker deal will likely move the sector towards embracing Big Data in production optimization,  said Jonathan Garrett of industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The new company will have roughly 70,000 employees and be led by Simonelli and 14 senior executives. Only five of those executives will be legacy Baker Hughes employees, with most from GE.  The company will have access to GE's research and development facilities and be able to access GE's Predix software and analytics, Simonelli said.

Firing,  he says evenly, before the .50 caliber shot rings out, sending tremors through the house. He was firing at a home less than a kilometer (a half mile) away, believed to be a stronghold of Islamist militants who have been holed up in Marawi City for over five weeks. A spotter sat next to him, with his scope set into another hole. The two spoke quietly to each other as the sniper took three more shots across the Agus river into the militant-held commercial district of Marawi, now a battleground strewn with debris from ruined buildings. Scores of bodies are rotting in the area, and the stench mixes with the smell of gunpowder. Thousands of soldiers are battling to retake the southern Philippine city, where militants loyal to Islamic State launched a lightning strike on May 23. The southern Philippines has been marred for decades by insurgency and banditry. But the intensity of the battle in Marawi and the presence of foreign fighters from Indonesia, Malaysia, Yemen and Chechnya fighting alongside local militants has raised concerns that the region may be becoming a Southeast Asian hub for Islamic State as it loses ground in Iraq and Syria. As troops poured in to contain the siege, few were expecting a slow, difficult and unfamiliar urban war.  We are used to insurgencies... but a deployment of this magnitude, this kind of conflict is a challenge for our troops,  said Lt Col Christopher Tampus, one of the officers commanding  ground operations in Marawi. He said progress in clearing the city has been hindered by militant fire and booby traps like gas tanks rigged with grenades. Reduced to Rubble After weeks of military airstrikes and shelling, Marawi, a lakeside city of around 200,000 is now a ghost town, the center of which has been reduced to charred rubble and hollow structures. Buildings in the military-controlled areas of the city are still standing but deserted after residents fled. Authorities estimate around 100 to 120 fighters, some of them as young as 16 years, remain holed up in the commercial district of the city, down from around 500 at the beginning of the siege. The fighters are holding around 100 hostages, according to the military, who have been forced to act as human shields, take up arms or become sex slaves.  Military aircraft drop bombs on the militant zone almost every day. From the outskirts of the city, mortar teams take aim at what they call  ground zero , the heart of the conflict. A Filipino soldier lies on a mattress at their combat position in a house as government troops continue their assault against insurgents from the Maute group in Marawi city, Philippines July 1, 2017.Jorge Silva Mortars are designed to target people and smaller areas than the airstrikes.  said mortar specialist Sgt. Jeffery Baybayan, as he jotted down coordinates that come crackling over a radio from an observer closer to the conflict area.  Hitting targets accurately can be difficult and we're expending rounds without hitting targets. We are concerned about our own troops that are very close to the enemy area,  he added, as the mortars exploded in the city, sending up plumes of thick black smoke.  Surrender Now or Die  During the day's battle, Tampus received reports that three civilians, trapped for weeks near the fighting, were trying to escape. Several soldiers responded to help rescue them - moving to the area in two lines along the sides of streets to avoid sniper fire. Three civilians - two men and a woman using a walking stick - came out and sat by the side of the street once they were in the military zone. Slideshow (18 Images) The bombs were so frequent coming from both sides,  said Jose Locanas, a 53-year-old Christian man trapped with his wife and friend in his house.  We were caught in the middle.  Troops said they received word from their relatives that the three were trapped and managed to escort them out. More than 400 people, including over 300 militants, 82 security forces and 44 civilians are known to have died in Marawi.  Some of the bodies of civilians were found decapitated and  the military has warned the number of residents killed by rebel  atrocities  could rise sharply as troops retake more ground. Every day, troops make announcements through loudspeakers for the militants to  surrender now or die . To the trapped civilians, they offer help to get out of the conflict area. Authorities say they believe the militants are running out of supplies and ammunition, but they say there is no deadline to retake the city. Tampus, the officer, said when troops reinforcements come into Marawi, they are initially apprehensive because of the high death toll.  But once they are here, the discipline kicks in and they are focused,  he said.

Beijing is tentatively removing barriers to foreign issuers as it seeks to internationalize its renminbi or yuan currency and open up sources of finance for its planned  One Belt, One Road  trade route that stretches as far as Europe. Portugal, whose location on Europe's Atlantic coast is some 10,000 km (6,250 miles) from Beijing, further away than any of its euro zone peers, plans to sell  Panda  bonds -- debt sold by foreign entities to investors in mainland China.   In practical terms, the issue aims to diversify the sources of financing of Portugal, opening a new market for its debt, and support the internationalization of the (renminbi),  a spokesman for the office of Prime Minister Antonio Costa told Reuters. He said strengthening trade links between the two countries would benefit both populations. Just a handful of foreign entities -- including sovereigns Poland and South Korea -- have sold Panda bonds in recent years, although Hong Kong's smaller, offshore, yuan-denominated  dim sum  market is well established. Panda bond issuance increased ninefold last year to 130 billion yuan ($19 billion), and is expected to grow by another 50 percent in 2017, according to JPMorgan.   Stronger Ties Portugal's ties with China date back some 500 years to the settlement of Macau, the trading post-turned-gambling hub that was Europe's last colony in Asia until it was handed back to China in 1999, just as Portugal joined the euro. After a crippling recession that pushed the indebted country into a bailout in 2011, Chinese cash helped aid its recovery.   Portugal is currently the top destination for Chinese investment in Europe as a share of its economy, according to figures from Spain's ESADE Business & Law School, and a number of Chinese firms have taken stakes in Portuguese companies. China Three Gorges owns 21 percent of Energias de Portugal while private conglomerate Fosun (0656.HK) upped its stake in bank Millennium bcp (BCP.LS) to 24 percent in February. Last year, Costa told Chinese state television that Portugal wanted to  actively participate  in Beijing's plans to develop a maritime sea route as part of the trade route initiative, dubbed the new Silk Road. He highlighted port capacity at Sines in Portugal's south. Hong Kong-based Richard Mazzochi of law firm KWM, who has been involved in a number of Panda bond deals, said linking to a specific project could help get Portugal's planned debt sale off the ground.       Applications are easier to make where there is already an established connection and if an issuer would use the proceeds in connection with One Belt, One Road initiatives, that would be helpful,  he said.  A deal could raise eyebrows among European authorities suspicious of China's plans to spread its global influence and concerned about transparency and access for foreign firms to the scheme. Major European countries have even mooted the idea of blocking Chinese investment on the continent. The EU is assessing whether a Beijing-funded rail project in Hungary, which has issued debt in China’s offshore market and is eyeing the onshore market, complies with EU law. Financial Reasons A board announces a Chinese market in downtown Lisbon, Portugal June 30, 2017. The board reads  Welcome . Picture taken June 30, 2017.Rafael MarchanteFinance Minister Mario Centeno told Reuters in May that selling a bond in the Chinese currency would allow Portugal to take advantage of growing demand for its debt, especially as a strengthening economy raises hopes for a credit rating upgrade.   The planned end in December of the European Central Bank's bond-buying scheme means diversifying into China -- the world's third-biggest debt market, behind the United States and Japan -- might appeal to other euro zone states.      Contacted by Reuters, the debt offices of Ireland, Italy and Belgium said they were open to issuing in yuan, while France, Spain and the Netherlands said they had no such plans. A German government source said such a transaction  had been on the table one or two years ago  but for  cost reasons  Berlin decided against it. Bankers at Standard Chartered and HSBC told Reuters they were working with European sovereigns on deals, but gave no details. Although China is nervous about capital outflows, a foreign government issuing there would serve as an endorsement of plans to internationalize the currency and its standing as a global economic power.      Mushtaq Kapasi, chief representative, Asia-Pacific at the International Capital Market Association, said Portugal's sovereign would also  give Chinese investors a level of trust .  In October, the yuan was added to the International Monetary Fund's small basket of reserve currencies, while the ECB added the Chinese currency to its foreign reserves this year. Barriers to Entry Spencer Maclean, a banker at Standard Chartered, said a sovereign bond sale would be a  precursor  for private firms from the country to tap Chinese markets. But barriers to entry remain. Bankers told Reuters that some countries may be nervous about the legal framework under which the bonds would be sold.  As Greece and Argentina experienced during their debt crises, it is hard to restructure bonds issued under foreign law.  The most common concern expressed by issuers is whether they  will be able to get the cash they have borrowed out of China.  The Chinese allow capital to flow in but it is still quite a challenging situation to convince the Chinese to use the proceeds abroad,  said Alexander Liebethal, head of new issues at German development bank KfW, which has issued in the Chinese offshore market.   If you look at the Panda market you will see a lot of issuers active there that have operations in China, like some German car manufacturers.   New guidelines on Panda bonds expected from Chinese regulators should add some clarity, bankers and lawyers said.  And for all that Portugal's deal is innovative, it may not be imminent.  These sort of projects take time,  said Portugal's debt agency chief Cristina Casalinho.  It would be a novelty for us.

Surveys of manufacturers across Europe published by data firm IHS Markit on Monday underlined Britain's challenge as it tries to become an export-led dynamo outside the European Union. The export orders gauge of the UK Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index slid to a five-month low in June.(Graphic: UK ranked bottom for export performance - PMIs click tmsnrt.rs/2t8l6lu) While still indicating growth in exports, it left Britain as the weakest performer in terms of foreign orders, barring Greece, among big western European economies for a fourth month running. That's a poor return for the pound's 12 percent fall against a range of currencies since the Brexit vote a year ago. It also casts doubt over the belief among some Bank of England officials that strong exports will help make up for a slowdown in consumer spending, suggesting the British economy could cope with a first interest rate hike in a decade.  Sterling's depreciation has been the least successful in Britain's post-war history,  said Samuel Tombs, economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy. Since sterling began to fall at the end of 2015, net trade has dragged on the economy, unlike after earlier sharp falls in the exchange rate in 1967, 1975, 1992 and 2007/08, Tombs said. Some indicators have suggested exporters are doing well.  The Confederation of British Industry's gauge of manufacturing exports, which is based on a different methodology to the PMIs, hit a 22-year high in June. But the official data is more muted: goods trade export volumes rose at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the three months to April, the best showing since January 2016 but still below rates seen through most of 2015. As well as putting Britain's export recovery into context, the latest figures suggest Britain's plan to become an export-led  champion of free trade  - as trade minister Liam Fox put it - is not entirely in its own hands.  Its success will hinge just as much on how well its competitors fare in winning business in the same markets and, on that score, the euro zone is showing its muscle.  I think that is a reflection of the euro area, in terms of them winning global trade gains due to the weak euro,  Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.  The euro is 17 percent weaker against the U.S. dollar than at the end of 2014, despite a recent rally. Part of the underperformance of British exporters in relation to the euro zone may reflect the fact that they have hiked selling prices faster, to help recoup rising energy and imported material costs exacerbated by the weak pound. While the euro zone's export price index rose 2.7 percent between the third quarter of last year and the first quarter of 2017, Britain's increased more than 8 percent. Increased volatility in sterling, which historically has been more stable than the euro against the dollar, might also be weighing on potential buyers of British goods.  It's not so much that the UK is doing badly, it's just that the euro zone is doing very well at the same time,  said Williamson.

The new company, to be called  Baker Hughes, a GE company,  will begin trading on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker  BHGE.  With headquarters in London and Houston, the combined company will have roughly $23 billion in annual revenue and offer oilfield gear including blowout preventers, pumps, drilling, chemicals, other products and services for oil producers in 120 countries. For Baker Hughes, the deal helps it grow in size and become an even-more important player in the industry after antitrust concerns scuttled a tie-up last year with rival Halliburton Co . The GE deal vaults the merged business past Halliburton to rival only Schlumberger NV for dominance in the global oilfield service market. For GE, the deal will help it focus more on the oil and gas sector, especially in North America, while shielding the parent company's earnings from the energy industry's boom and bust cycles. All of GE's oil and gas-related businesses will be folded into the new company, which will be 62.5 percent owned by GE. Baker shareholders will own the rest and receive a one-time, $17.50 dividend. The deal, when announced last autumn, was predicated on a recovery in the oil price to $60 per barrel by 2019, an increase that now seems less likely with a glut of crude still circling the globe and keeping prices below $50. Still, executives at the new company said the combination should help customers better perform if prices stay lower.  The crystal ball for all of us is cloudy,  said Lorenzo Simonelli, the company's chief executive, who will relocate to Houston from London.  But we know energy requirements are still going to increase, globally. The fundamentals are there for energy.  Analysts and investors generally praised the deal as data analytics and other high-technology operations grow in demand among oil producers.  The GE-Baker deal will likely move the sector towards embracing Big Data in production optimization,  said Jonathan Garrett of industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The new company will have roughly 70,000 employees and be led by Simonelli and 14 senior executives. Only five of those executives will be legacy Baker Hughes employees, with most from GE. The company will have access to GE's research and development facilities and be able to access GE's Predix software and analytics, Simonelli said.

The Outlook on National Bank of Oman (NBO) remains Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDRs) of all six banks. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. These rating actions follow the revision of the Outlook on the Omani sovereign to Negative (see 'Fitch Revises Oman's Outlook to Negative; Affirms at 'BBB' dated 19 June 2017 on www.fitchratings.com). KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATINGS, SUPPORT RATING FLOORS AND SENIOR DEBT - ABO, BD and BS ABO's, BD's and BS' IDRs, Support Ratings (SRs) and Support Rating Floors (SRFs) reflect Fitch's expectation of a high probability of support from the Omani authorities in case of need. Fitch believes Oman has the financial flexibility, albeit weakening due to lower oil prices, to support its banking system. The fiscal policy response to the drop in oil prices has not prevented a significant deterioration in public finances. Fitch believes the Omani authorities' willingness to support domestic banks remains high, partly because of high contagion risk (small number and high concentration of banks in the system) and the importance of the banking system in building the local economy. We view ABO (6% market share), BD (13%) and BS (8%) as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) in Oman; their SRF is therefore equal to the 'BBB-' D-SIB SRF in Oman. The Negative Outlook on ABO's, BD's and BS's IDRs reflects that on the Omani sovereign rating. BD's senior debt ratings are driven by the same factors that drive its IDRs. IDRS, SR, SRF AND SENIOR DEBT - BM BM's Viability Rating (VR) is at the same level as the bank's SRF. Its IDRs are driven by the bank's intrinsic financial strength (as measured by the VR) and are underpinned by sovereign support. BM's SR and SRF reflect Fitch's expectation of a high probability of support from the Omani authorities in case of need. As the country's dominant bank with a 36% market share, BM's SRF is one notch above the D-SIB SRF, at 'BBB'. The Negative Outlook on BM's IDR reflects that on the Omani sovereign rating. The 'F3' Short-Term IDR of BM is the lower of two possibilities mapping to its 'BBB' Long-Term IDR. This is because approximately 35% of the bank's funding is related to the government and a stress scenario for the bank is likely to come at a time when the sovereign itself is experiencing some form of stress. BM's senior debt ratings are driven by the same factors that drive its IDRs. IDRS, SR AND SRF - NBO Although NBO's VR and SRF are at the same level, the Negative Outlook on the sovereign means the bank's IDRs are driven by its intrinsic financial strength, as measured by the VR, since its SRF could be revised lower in the event of a sovereign downgrade. NBO's SR and SRF reflect Fitch's expectation of a high probability of support from the Omani authorities in case of need. We view NBO (12% market share) as a D-SIB in Oman; its SRF is therefore equal to the 'BBB-' D-SIB SRF in Oman. The Stable Outlook on NBO reflects the expected stability of its VR, which would not be impacted by a one-notch sovereign downgrade. IDRS AND SR - HBON HBON's IDRs and SR are driven by our expectation of an extremely high probability of support available to the bank from its ultimate parent, HSBC Holdings (HSBC; AA-/Stable/aa-). This reflects HSBC's strong ability to support HBON, and HBON's manageable and negligible size as a share of total group assets. This view is supported by HBON's role in the group, providing products and services in a market identified as strategically important to HSBC. Our support view also factors in strong integration (including management, systems and risk practices), common branding and the high reputational risk that an HBON default would mean for HSBC. HBON's Long-Term IDR is capped by the Omani Country Ceiling, which captures transfer and convertibility (T&C;) risk, and the Negative Outlook reflects that on the Omani sovereign rating. If T&C; considerations did not apply, HBON's Long-Term IDR would be notched down once from HSBC's 'AA-' Long-Term IDR, with a Stable Outlook. The Negative Outlook on HBON reflects indirectly the Negative Outlook on the Omani sovereign as a sovereign downgrade is likely to be accompanied by a downgrade of the Country Ceiling. According to our criteria, a Long-Term IDR of 'A-' corresponds to a Short-Term IDR of either 'F1' or 'F2'. We have affirmed the 'F1' Short-Term IDR because we view the liquidity profile of HBON's parent as extremely strong. We do not assign a SRF to HBON because in our view the most likely source of extraordinary support for this bank is its shareholder and not the government authorities. SRFs are assigned to banks which would, in our opinion, receive extraordinary support from the government in the first instance. VRS The VR of BM is capped by the operating environment, its company profile and risk appetite, and more specifically by the Omani sovereign rating. BM is predominantly a domestic bank with significant links to the sovereign and domestic operating environment. The VR is underpinned by the dominant franchise of BM in Oman, which supports its ability to generate healthy operating profits, and despite a difficult operating environment, its sound and resilient asset quality. We also take into account its capital ratios with satisfactory buffers over regulatory minimums in light of some lending concentration, and a substantial depositor base with a strong retail component. Deposits are diversified compared with domestic and regional peers. Liquidity is stable and sound and is a focus for the bank. BM's management is one of the strongest in the country, with depth, stability and experience and sound execution of the bank's strategy. The VR of ABO is constrained by a weaker funding profile relative to peers, with high deposit concentration, greater reliance on wholesale markets to fund its loan book than peers, and tightening liquidity. The bank benefits from being part of the Ahli United Bank group and its wider regional network, notably in terms of depth, stability and experience of upper management. The bank's track record of resilient asset quality and performance compares well with peers'. The bank's VR also factors in the bank's satisfactory capital buffers above the minimum regulatory requirements, in light of high lending concentrations, as well as a moderate franchise in Oman. NBO's VR reflects a solid franchise in Oman, the depth, stability and experience of upper management, and less loan concentration compared with peers. We expect some pressure on asset quality from the operating environment, which could lead to higher loan impairment charges. However, NBO's cost efficiency and high net interest margins are likely to support profitability. The Fitch core capital (FCC) ratio is only adequate; however, measured risk appetite and growth targets underpin satisfactory regulatory capital buffers. The VR also factors in the bank's adequate and stable liquidity and diversified funding compared with some peers. HBON's VR is supported by the bank's company profile, which benefits from being part of the HSBC group for product offering, geographical reach and the depth, stability and experience of management. Sound buffers of regulatory capital and higher liquidity than peers are also factored into the rating, particularly as Fitch expects ample liquidity and capital would be available from the group in case of need. HBON's balance sheet is more liquid than that of peers, which is one reason for the bank's weak profitability, which remains below peer average but is continuously improving. Impaired loans remain fairly high compared with domestic peers, but these are primarily legacy loans and are well-covered by reserves. New impaired loans are reasonably limited. The bank's current more conservative underwriting standards should continue to support stable asset quality. The VR of BD reflects its tight capital buffers, above-peer average loan and deposit concentrations, and tight funding, with greater reliance on wholesale funding than higher-rated peers, which contributes to high funding costs. The VR also factors in the bank's sound Omani franchise, depth and stability of management, good cost control and resilient asset quality metrics. Nevertheless we expect some pressure on asset quality from the operating environment that could lead to higher loan impairment charges. The VR of BS reflects a weaker funding profile relative to peers, with high deposit concentration, higher balance of term deposits, and greater reliance on wholesale and interbank markets to fund its loan book than peers. It also factors in the bank's tight capital buffers in light of lending concentrations, limited liquidity and modest earnings. It also reflects high management turnover, some reliance on a few key individuals and the lack of a clear strategy following the end of merger talks with BD. Positively, BS' asset quality metrics have proved resilient. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND SENIOR DEBT - BM, ABO, BD and BS BM's IDRs are sensitive to a simultaneous downgrade of the bank's VR and SRF. ABO's, BD's and BS' IDRs are sensitive to a downgrade of their SRF. NBO's IDRs are sensitive to a downgrade of the bank's VR. The senior debt ratings are sensitive to the same factors that affect the IDRs. SRS AND SRFS - BM, NBO, ABO, BD and BS All five banks' SRs and SRFs are sensitive to a change in Fitch's assumptions around the Omani authorities' propensity or ability to provide timely support to the banking sector. If the sovereign is downgraded by one notch all SRFs would also be revised down by one notch. IDR AND SR - HBON HBON's Long-Term IDR and SR are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of HSBC's ability or propensity to provide support. A one notch downgrade of the Omani sovereign is also likely to result in a one notch downgrade of HBON's Long-Term IDR as Fitch's Country Ceiling, which captures T&C; risk, is also likely to be downgraded. VRS BM's VR is the highest in Oman and is constrained by the challenging operating environment. A downgrade of the VR would most likely be a result of a sovereign downgrade or a deteriorating operating environment affecting BM's company profile and risk appetite, particularly should that lead to worsening asset quality or an inability to generate stable earnings through the cycle. Weakening of NBO's liquidity or significant worsening of asset quality could put pressure on the VR. An upgrade of the VR is unlikely given the difficult operating environment. ABO's VR is sensitive to changes in the bank's funding and liquidity. HBON's VR is sensitive to material changes in asset quality and profitability metrics. An upgrade of BD's VR would be contingent on the bank significantly strengthening its franchise in Oman, its funding profile and its capitalisation. Downward pressure would most likely be a result of weakening capital, funding or asset quality. The VR of BS is sensitive to further deterioration of its funding profile or weakening capital, whether as a result of rapid growth or worsening asset quality, although this is not Fitch's expectation. A prolonged delay in setting a clear and well-defined strategy could be negative for the VR if that leads to a weakening financial profile. Upside to the VR is contingent on the bank significantly strengthening its funding profile and capitalisation.

But the rescue and recovery volunteer had no time to waste as gunfire rang out from government troop positions and militant snipers around him: he put on a pair of rubber gloves and helped carry the remains out of the conflict zone in a pick-up truck.  I thought of resigning after that,  Pacasum, who works in a disaster relief office told Reuters.  I was scared and not prepared for this kind of job.   But Pacasum, 39, continued to lead a team of about 30 young men and women who make near-daily forays to rescue civilians and retrieve victims in an urban battlefield that is infested with rebel snipers and battered by air strikes. They have come to be known as the  white helmets  or  suicide squad  because of the risks they take when going in unarmed and wearing little protection other than white plastic construction helmets. More than 460 people have been killed since the battle for Marawi began on May 23, including 82 members of the security forces and 44 civilians.  The military believes hundreds of civilians are still trapped by the conflict, the biggest internal security threat the Philippines has faced in decades and a shock to neighboring countries worried that Islamic State is trying to establish a foothold in Southeast Asia. Rescue Mission Fishermen, farmers, students, and small business owners, mostly from Marawi, are among those who have volunteered for rescue missions.  We all grew up in Marawi and it breaks our hearts when we hear that Marawi is under siege,  said Abdul Azis Lomondot Jr., a 25-year-old university student, speaking in the team's one-room office in the town's capitol complex where many of the  white helmets  grab some sleep.

Team leader Pacasum then asks for volunteers.  We grab our helmets, IDs, a ladder, some small tools and we are good to go,  said Lomondot. One such mission around three weeks into the siege almost went awry when the team drove into the conflict area in pick-up trucks but could not immediately find the house where four elderly people were known to be trapped.  In that moment, I was panicking because I thought this may be an ambush,  Pacasum said as he and Lamondot recalled the mission.  We were just waiting for the sound of gunshots.

Too Stressful” As the siege drags on and the government pours troops into the lakeside town, soldiers have started providing cover for some of the rescue teams’ missions. Pacasum says that while this has obvious advantages, it can also mean they are more likely to be targeted by the militants. The team has also received counseling and equipment from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and training on how to properly handle cadavers.   Pacasum, who has led more 10 rescue missions, wants to see the battle through to the end, but will consider changing professions when it's over.   It's too stressful, he said.   Some of the volunteers ... they are just young kids, they are very aggressive. I'm more cautious. I have kids and I want to watch them grow old.

Surveys of manufacturers across Europe published by data firm IHS Markit on Monday underlined Britain's challenge as it tries to become an export-led dynamo outside the European Union. The export orders gauge of the UK Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index slid to a five-month low in June.(Graphic: UK ranked bottom for export performance - PMIs click tmsnrt.rs/2t8l6lu) While still indicating growth in exports, it left Britain as the weakest performer in terms of foreign orders, barring Greece, among big western European economies for a fourth month running. That's a poor return for the pound's 12 percent fall against a range of currencies since the Brexit vote a year ago. It also casts doubt over the belief among some Bank of England officials that strong exports will help make up for a slowdown in consumer spending, suggesting the British economy could cope with a first interest rate hike in a decade.  Sterling's depreciation has been the least successful in Britain's post-war history,  said Samuel Tombs, economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy. Since sterling began to fall at the end of 2015, net trade has dragged on the economy, unlike after earlier sharp falls in the exchange rate in 1967, 1975, 1992 and 2007/08, Tombs said. Some indicators have suggested exporters are doing well.  The Confederation of British Industry's gauge of manufacturing exports, which is based on a different methodology to the PMIs, hit a 22-year high in June. But the official data is more muted: goods trade export volumes rose at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the three months to April, the best showing since January 2016 but still below rates seen through most of 2015. As well as putting Britain's export recovery into context, the latest figures suggest Britain's plan to become an export-led  champion of free trade  - as trade minister Liam Fox put it - is not entirely in its own hands.  Its success will hinge just as much on how well its competitors fare in winning business in the same markets and, on that score, the euro zone is showing its muscle.  I think that is a reflection of the euro area, in terms of them winning global trade gains due to the weak euro,  Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.  The euro is 17 percent weaker against the U.S. dollar than at the end of 2014, despite a recent rally. Part of the underperformance of British exporters in relation to the euro zone may reflect the fact that they have hiked selling prices faster, to help recoup rising energy and imported material costs exacerbated by the weak pound. While the euro zone's export price index rose 2.7 percent between the third quarter of last year and the first quarter of 2017, Britain's increased more than 8 percent. Increased volatility in sterling, which historically has been more stable than the euro against the dollar, might also be weighing on potential buyers of British goods.  It's not so much that the UK is doing badly, it's just that the euro zone is doing very well at the same time,  said Williamson.

The Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index MXPMIM=ECI rose to 52.3 in June from 51.2 in May when adjusted for seasonal swings, hitting its highest since May 2016. A reading above 50 signals expansion in the sector, while a reading below that points to contraction.  The latest PMI survey provides a positive signal for near-term growth momentum across the Mexican manufacturing sector,  senior IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said in a statement. Moore noted the rebound followed a sluggish period early this year where the PMI headline rate was close to its lowest reading in three years. Higher sales volumes pushed the rate of employment growth to a 14-month high, while input price inflation was down from a peak early this year after the peso sank to a record low. But the peso has bounced back and business confidence has improved as U.S. President Donald Trump backed away from  threats to impose tariffs on Mexican-made goods and moved toward a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports, which are mostly manufactured goods like cars and TVs, to the United States. The PMI index is composed of five sub-indexes tracking changes in new orders, output, employment, suppliers' delivery times and stocks of raw materials.

The new company, to be called  Baker Hughes, a GE company,  will begin trading on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker  BHGE.  With headquarters in London and Houston, the combined company will have roughly $23 billion in annual revenue and offer oilfield gear including blowout preventers, pumps, drilling, chemicals, other products and services for oil producers in 120 countries.  For Baker Hughes, the deal helps it grow in size and become an even-more important player in the industry after antitrust concerns scuttled a tie-up last year with rival Halliburton Co. The GE deal vaults the merged business past Halliburton to rival only Schlumberger NV for dominance in the global oilfield service market. For GE, the deal will help it focus more on the oil and gas sector, especially in North America, while shielding the parent company's earnings from the energy industry's boom and bust cycles. All of GE's oil and gas-related businesses will be folded into the new company, which will be 62.5 percent owned by GE. Baker shareholders will own the rest and receive a one-time, $17.50 dividend.    The deal, when announced last autumn, was predicated on a recovery in the oil price to $60 per barrel by 2019, an increase that now seems less likely with a glut of crude still circling the globe and keeping prices below $50. A Baker Hughes sign is displayed outside the oil logistics company's local office in Sherwood Park, near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada November 13, 2016.Chris HelgrenStill, executives at the new company said the combination should help customers better perform if prices stay lower.  The crystal ball for all of us is cloudy,  said Lorenzo Simonelli, the company's chief executive, who will relocate to Houston from London.  But we know energy requirements are still going to increase, globally. The fundamentals are there for energy.  Analysts and investors generally praised the deal as data analytics and other high-technology operations grow in demand among oil producers.  The GE-Baker deal will likely move the sector towards embracing Big Data in production optimization,  said Jonathan Garrett of industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The new company will have roughly 70,000 employees and be led by Simonelli and 14 senior executives. Only five of those executives will be legacy Baker Hughes employees, with most from GE.  The company will have access to GE's research and development facilities and be able to access GE's Predix software and analytics, Simonelli said.

The carefully choreographed media event was supposed to send a clear message that rifts in the African National Congress (ANC) have been mended and that party members are focused on policy rather than a looming leadership battle. But behind the scenes, the party remains deeply divided over who should succeed Zuma at a conference in December. One faction backs Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and another Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, former African Union chair and Zuma's ex-wife. Dlamini-Zuma's camp says it wants to radically address racial inequality by increasing black ownership of land and businesses, while Ramaphosa's supporters pledge to end the corruption and scandals that have plagued the ANC under Zuma. In the build-up to the six-day meeting, held once every five years, there have been public spats between the two camps and ANC sources said it was likely the leadership question would dominate what is ostensibly a policy conference. But the president was keen to put aside any talk of backroom jostling.  It is going absolutely very well. The results are going to be wonderful,  Zuma, dressed in an ANC leather jacket and baseball cap, told reporters, who were marshaled by dozens of security staff and not allowed to ask questions. Accompanying Zuma and nodding in agreement was ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa, who chose an unusually casual outfit for a party conference - trainers, sweatpants and sunglasses.  If things weren't going well, would I be dressed like this?  Kodwa told Reuters, before briefly running on the spot.  I'm so relaxed because things are going so well.  At a sprawling venue in the shadow of Soccer City stadium in Soweto, journalists are separated from the thousands of party delegates by a high metal fence and only allowed out for stage-managed events under the watchful eye of security. South Africa's President Jacob Zuma gestures during his address at the African National Congress 5th National Policy Conference at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Soweto, South Africa June 30, 2017.Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo You're not allowed to wander around alone in case you don't know where to go,  one security guard told Reuters.  White Monopoly Capital  Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma both talk of  radical socio-economic transformation , a vague ANC plan to tackle the glaring racial inequality that exists 23 years after the end of apartheid. In reality, the two factions in the ANC have major ideological differences. Dlamini-Zuma, who has the support of Zuma and his powerful grassroots Zulu ANC support base, has accused her opponents of being  anti-transformation  and too cozy with rich whites. She has called for the defeat of the  enemy  of  white monopoly capital . White South Africans, who make up 9 percent of the population, still control much of the economy. These messages play well with many poorer, rural ANC delegates who believe rich people in the ANC, like Ramaphosa, have not done enough to redistribute wealth since the end of white minority rule. Ramaphosa has also pledged to tackle inequality but is viewed as more moderate and investor-friendly. A trade unionist-turned-business tycoon, he has been a vocal critic of corruption. Some of his supporters say Dlamini-Zuma would do little to clean up an atmosphere of sleaze in public life that grew under her husband's presidency. Critics charge that under Zuma, the idealism epitomized by former president Nelson Mandela has been replaced by a scramble for power and patronage, dividing the party and tarnishing the reputation of the post-apartheid  Rainbow Nation . Popular support for the ANC has slumped. Though few major policy changes are expected to be agreed at this week's meeting, the agenda will be watched for clues to whose voice - Ramaphosa's or Dlamini-Zuma's - seems the dominant one.

Automakers' shares rose as overall industry sales still came in above Wall Street expectations. The U.S. auto industry is bracing for a downturn after hitting a record 17.55 million new vehicles sold in 2016. Analysts had predicted that overall, U.S. vehicle sales would fall in June for the fourth consecutive month. As the market has shown signs of cooling, automakers have hiked discounts and loosened lending terms. Car shopping website Edmunds said on Monday the average length of a car loan reached an all-time high of 69.3 months in June.  It's financially risky, leaving borrowers exposed to being upside down on their vehicles for a large chunk of their loans,  said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry analysis. GM said its sales fell about 5 percent versus June 2016, but that the industry would see stronger sales in the second half of 2017 versus the first half. GM shares were up 2.4 percent in morning trading, while Ford rose 3.3 percent and FCA shares jumped 6 percent.  U.S. total sales are moderating due to an industry-wide pullback in daily rental sales, but key U.S. economic fundamentals clearly remain positive,  said GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem.  Under the current economic conditions, we anticipate U.S. retail vehicle sales will remain strong for the foreseeable future.  Ford said its sales for June were hit by lower fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government entities, which fell 13.9 percent, while sales to consumers were flat. On a media call, Ford executives said an initial read of automakers' sales figures indicated a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of around 17 million new vehicles for the month, which would be better than 16.6 million units analysts had predicted. FCA said June sales decreased 7 percent versus the same month a year earlier. Toyota Motor Corp said sales rose 2.1 percent versus June 2016 and said it saw strong gains in the RAV4, a light SUV, sales of which increased 24.7 percent. Sales of another SUV, the 4Runner, rose 16.6 percent. But sales at Toyota's Lexus luxury car brand fell 5.4 percent on the year. Nissan Motor Co Ltd said its U.S. sales increased 2 percent. But while truck, SUV and crossover sales jumped 19.5 percent, sedan sales dropped 12.1 percent. In the past few years, Americans have increasingly shunned smaller passenger cars in favor of larger vehicles. Honda Motor Co Ltd said sales for June were up 0.8 percent.

The carefully choreographed media event was supposed to send a clear message that rifts in the African National Congress (ANC) have been mended and that party members are focused on policy rather than a looming leadership battle. But behind the scenes, the party remains deeply divided over who should succeed Zuma at a conference in December. One faction backs Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and another Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, former African Union chair and Zuma's ex-wife. Dlamini-Zuma's camp says it wants to radically address racial inequality by increasing black ownership of land and businesses, while Ramaphosa's supporters pledge to end the corruption and scandals that have plagued the ANC under Zuma. In the build-up to the six-day meeting, held once every five years, there have been public spats between the two camps and ANC sources said it was likely the leadership question would dominate what is ostensibly a policy conference. But the president was keen to put aside any talk of backroom jostling.  It is going absolutely very well. The results are going to be wonderful,  Zuma, dressed in an ANC leather jacket and baseball cap, told reporters, who were marshaled by dozens of security staff and not allowed to ask questions. Accompanying Zuma and nodding in agreement was ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa, who chose an unusually casual outfit for a party conference - trainers, sweatpants and sunglasses.  If things weren't going well, would I be dressed like this?  Kodwa told Reuters, before briefly running on the spot.  I'm so relaxed because things are going so well.  At a sprawling venue in the shadow of Soccer City stadium in Soweto, journalists are separated from the thousands of party delegates by a high metal fence and only allowed out for stage-managed events under the watchful eye of security. South Africa's President Jacob Zuma gestures during his address at the African National Congress 5th National Policy Conference at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Soweto, South Africa June 30, 2017.Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo You're not allowed to wander around alone in case you don't know where to go,  one security guard told Reuters.  White Monopoly Capital  Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma both talk of  radical socio-economic transformation , a vague ANC plan to tackle the glaring racial inequality that exists 23 years after the end of apartheid. In reality, the two factions in the ANC have major ideological differences. Dlamini-Zuma, who has the support of Zuma and his powerful grassroots Zulu ANC support base, has accused her opponents of being  anti-transformation  and too cozy with rich whites. She has called for the defeat of the  enemy  of  white monopoly capital . White South Africans, who make up 9 percent of the population, still control much of the economy. These messages play well with many poorer, rural ANC delegates who believe rich people in the ANC, like Ramaphosa, have not done enough to redistribute wealth since the end of white minority rule. Ramaphosa has also pledged to tackle inequality but is viewed as more moderate and investor-friendly. A trade unionist-turned-business tycoon, he has been a vocal critic of corruption. Some of his supporters say Dlamini-Zuma would do little to clean up an atmosphere of sleaze in public life that grew under her husband's presidency. Critics charge that under Zuma, the idealism epitomized by former president Nelson Mandela has been replaced by a scramble for power and patronage, dividing the party and tarnishing the reputation of the post-apartheid  Rainbow Nation . Popular support for the ANC has slumped. Though few major policy changes are expected to be agreed at this week's meeting, the agenda will be watched for clues to whose voice - Ramaphosa's or Dlamini-Zuma's - seems the dominant one.

Former Chief Executive John Varley along with Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath were charged by Britain's Serious Fraud Office last month in the first criminal prosecution for senior bankers' actions during the financial crisis. Barclays Plc was also charged with fraud and unlawful financial assistance. Lawyers representing Jenkins and Boath said in June they would contest the charges, while those representing Varley and Kalaris declined to comment. Barclays, which has previously said it is considering its position, declined to comment.  In a 60 minute hearing at Westminster magistrates court, the case was sent to Southwark Crown Court, with the next hearing scheduled for July 17.  The defendants did not enter any pleas.  The case is likely to be the last chance for prosecutors in Britain to bring criminal charges against bank executives for actions taken during the financial crisis, with the charges carrying a maximum jail term of 10 years. It is also a test of the Serious Fraud Office, after Britain's ruling Conservative party in its election manifesto called for the prosecutor to be folded into the National Crime Agency. Former Barclays CEO John Varley arrives at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London, Britain July 3, 2017.Neil HallAdvisory Payments The case centers on agreements between Barclays and Qatari investors during two fundraisings in June and October 2008. Qatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested around 5.3 billion pounds in Barclays. Slideshow (3 Images)Authorities have examined whether payments from Barclays to Qatar at the same time, such as around 322 million pounds in  advisory services agreements  (ASA), alongside the $3 billion loan, were honest and properly disclosed. Varley, 61; former Middle East and North African investment banking head Jenkins, 61; Kalaris, once the CEO of Barclays Wealth, also 61; and Boath, a 58-year-old former European head of financial institutions, were charged over disclosure of the June 2008 deal. Varley and Jenkins face a further charge for the October deal, and a charge of 'unlawful financial assistance' which alleges the fundraising breached rules preventing a company lending a third party money to buy its own shares. Chris Lucas, finance director of Barclays in 2008, is listed as a co-conspirator to the charges, but has not been charged. A lawyer who represents Lucas declined to comment. Jenkins, who lives in the United States, and Kalaris, who has dual-nationality, were each asked to post 500,000 pounds in bail. The other defendants were not given any bail requirements.

Regulators and market participants say the agencies were slow to adjust ratings on some companies that subsequently defaulted, including Amtek Auto Ltd in 2015. Their concerns have grown as markets have witnessed a record-setting surge in corporate bond sales.  We are not happy with the current state of affairs of rating agencies,  Tyagi told reporters in the sidelines of an event. The Securities and Exchange Board of India said on Friday that under the new rules agencies must monitor more closely whether issuers are meeting their debt obligations, and increasing disclosure requirements. Tyagi said the regulator was considering a further set of proposed regulations, adding it would issue a discussion paper  within a month.  He did not provide any specifics. Rating agencies on Monday declined to comment on SEBI's proposals. A source at one of India's four major rating agencies said that the timing of the rules had come as a surprise and that the company was still  trying to figure what this would mean for us.  He said the company would contact SEBI for additional clarifications and was not aware of any pending regulations. India has four major rating agencies, of which three are majority-owned by the big three global agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service. But they operate independently of their parent companies with different rating standards. Corporate bond issuance surged 37.2 percent to 2 trillion rupees in the first half of 2017, the highest first-half figure since records began in 2000, according to Thomson Reuters data. Late last year, SEBI tightened disclosure norms for credit rating agencies in a bid to boost transparency and accountability. Global regulators have been cracking down on credit rating agencies in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, which many say was a result of inflated ratings assigned by agencies on complex mortgage-backed securities.

Manufacturing figures showing continuing growth in central Europe, meanwhile, failed to give a lasting lift to currencies in the region.     Romania's central bank kept interest rates on hold at record lows at its meeting, as expected. Governor Mugur Isarescu said inflation could run slightly higher than expected, adding the bank was alert to risks from the budget of new Prime Minister Mihai Tudose's government.     The government's plans to overhaul taxes have given new fuel to worries over a likely rise in the budget deficit and inflation.     The leu had fallen more than a third of a percent against the euro to 4.575 by 1342 GMT.      Uncertainties will continue to dominate the landscape,  Erste analysts said in a note, adding the central bank may start to lift interest rates late this year.     It did not signal a hike on Monday.     Poland's central bank is not expected to change rates either at its meeting on Wednesday.     Analysts in a Reuters poll projected its first hike could come only in the last quarter of 2018. They projected the third quarter a month ago, and the third quarter two months ago.     The zloty eased 0.3 percent to 4.2425 per euro.      It weakened a little after (the June) PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index), which was slightly lower than we expected,  said ING BSK analyst Jakub Rybacki.     Regional PMI data showed economic growth continuing, even though Poland's 53.1 and the Czech Republic's 56.4 readings were a bit lower than expected.     The only monetary authority in the region that has signalled monetary tightening may be near - after many years of loose policy - is the Czech central bank (CNB).     The Czech crown, trading at 26.089 against the euro early on Monday, touched its strongest level since the CNB three months ago removed a cap that had kept the currency weaker than 27 for three and a half years.     It had retreated to 26.128 by 1342 GMT.     The crown could continue to strengthen to 26 or even beyond, boosted by investors who sold tens of billions of euros to the CNB before the removal of the cap, betting on a crown surge, one Prague-based dealer said.      The question is where the long-term (euro) short-betters have their target value,  the dealer said.

Adding to that, Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) was involved in the second biggest deal of the quarter, for an Australian utility, but it was unclear whether it would be as active overseas in coming months in light of a punishing diplomatic rift with its Gulf neighbors. SWFs did 29 deals in the second quarter, down from 34 in the first when the total value was $9.9 billion, Thomson Reuters data showed. The bumper second quarter total was only slightly below the $32.1 billion achieved in Q3 2016.  The second quarter was boosted by a handful of megadeals, including Blackstone selling Logicor to CIC in Europe's biggest ever private equity real estate deal.   Logistics is the jewel in the crown – it's a very trendy sub-group within real estate because it is connected with e-commerce,  said Javier Capape, a director at the Sovereign Wealth Lab research center at the IE Business School in Madrid.   SWFs are long-term investors looking for disruption - they are looking for the new winners,  he said.  CIC was also involved in the third largest deal of the quarter, a $4.5 billion recapitalization of China Everbright Bank, of which it is the ultimate parent. In total CIC completed six deals, in high-tech, healthcare and financials, while Singaporean SWF GIC, which has been on a buying spree for several quarters, did five deals, mainly in financials. JP Morgan Asset Management's head of international institutional clients, Patrick Thomson, said Asian funds in particular were becoming more active managers.  We're seeing much more dynamic asset allocation and much higher allocations to alternatives, including infrastructure and direct deals,  he said.  Investec Asset Management strategist Michael Power said that with oil prices still so low, there was less of a surplus for some of the oil-based funds to recycle:  So there's an element of the trade-based SWFs taking advantage of the lack of competition.  QIA was one of the more active Middle Eastern funds, participating in a consortium that bought a stake in Australian power distributor Endeavour Energy for $5.6 billion. It also bought two offices in California for $352.8 million, in conjunction with real estate investor Douglas Emmett. It was unclear whether QIA would be as acquisitive in coming months given the sanctions imposed by its neighbors.  It's difficult to assess - it will depend on whether they can reach an agreement in the short run,  said Capape.  I wouldn't be surprised to see some refocusing in Qatar if the situation continues.   Boston Consulting Group senior partner Markus Massi, based in the Middle East, said no SWF could afford to sit on the sidelines.  Also there will be deals that have been done that have to be followed through, and deal flow from partnership agreements with others that they want to participate in.

Qatar has called the accusations baseless and says the demands - which include closing Qatar-based al Jazeera TV and ejecting Turkish troops based there - are so severe that they seem designed to be rejected. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have raised the possibility of further sanctions against Qatar if it does not comply with the 13 demands presented to Doha through Kuwait, which is acting as a mediator. According to a joint statement on Saudi state news agency SPA, the four countries agreed to a request by Kuwait to extend by 48 hours Sunday's deadline for compliance. They have not specified what further sanctions they could impose on Doha, but commercial bankers in the region believe that Saudi, Emirati and Bahraini banks might receive official guidance to pull deposits and interbank loans from Qatar. Foreign ministers from the four countries will meet in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss Qatar, Egypt said, while Kuwaiti state media reported that Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani had submitted to Kuwait Doha's formal response to the Arab states' demands. The four states cut diplomatic and commercial ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism, meddling in their internal affairs and advancing the agenda of regional foe Iran, all of which Qatar denies. Mediation efforts, including by the United States, have been fruitless.

But it has not hit energy exports from Qatar, the world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Trump spoke separately on Sunday to the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Qatar and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in the UAE to discuss his  concerns about the ongoing dispute , the White House said.  He reiterated the importance of stopping terrorist financing and discrediting extremist ideology. The president also underscored that unity in the region is critical to accomplishing the Riyadh Summit's goals of defeating terrorism and promoting regional stability,  it said.  President Trump, nevertheless, believes that the overriding objective of his initiative is the cessation of funding for terrorism,  the White House added.

Urging Restraint A State Department official said on Sunday that the United States encouraged  all parties to exercise restraint to allow for productive diplomatic discussions . Qatari officials say the demands are so strict that the four countries never seriously intended them as a negotiating position and see them as being aimed at hobbling Doha's sovereignty.  Slideshow (2 Images)Qatar says it is interested in negotiating a fair and just solution to  any legitimate issues  of concern to fellow member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE. Qatar's Gulf critics accuse Al Jazeera of being a platform for extremists and an agent of interference in their affairs. The network has rejected the accusations and said it will maintain its editorial independence. Gulf countries have insisted that their demands are non- negotiable.  The UAE's minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, has played down the chances of an escalation, saying  the alternative is not escalation but parting ways , suggesting Qatar may be forced out of the GCC. The Western-backed GCC was formed in 1981 in the wake of Iran's Islamic Revolution and the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war. Qataris are waiting anxiously for a resolution of the conflict but have remained largely supportive of the government. Shopping for groceries in a Doha mall, Qatari Abdul Aziz al-Horr, who works in business education, said he hoped no new sanctions were coming.  Any escalation will be something that is not for the good of anybody. Destabilizing Qatar will have a major impact on the whole region, and even globally,  he said.

UBS set up Europe SE in December to consolidate most of its European wealth management operations but some countries such as France were not included. A UBS spokesman confirmed the contents of the memo, which was sent to staff by Paul Raphael, UBS's wealth management head for Europe and emerging markets. UBS's emerging markets business does not include Asia Pacific.  The restructure was reported earlier by Bloomberg.  UBS, which is the world's biggest private bank by assets, will also consolidate its cross-border business in Europe and emerging markets into three booking hubs in Switzerland, Europe SE and Britain.  Raphael also outlined a raft of management changes, including a replacement for its UK wealth management head, Jamie Broderick.

The talented 22-year-old called for the physio and packed up after losing the first two sets to doubles specialist Pierre-Hugues Herbert 6-3 6-4, having hardly run for any of the Frenchman's peppering of drop shots, lobs and passing shots. Kyrgios was also forced to retire during his first-round match at the Queen's Club Championships in London last month after falling awkwardly, and had come into Wimbledon saying he was only about 60 to 65 percent fit.  I kind of knew I was in trouble. I have been feeling my hip ever since I fell over at Queen's. Never got it right. I was doing everything I could to help it, but just not enough time,  a despondent Kyrgios told reporters.  I spoke to the doctor before the tournament started. He was leaning towards me not even playing. It's my favorite tournament. I do well here every year. So it's tough for me to go out there and get beaten and pull out.  After being broken in the second set to go down 4-3, Kyrgios sat at first shaking his head then with his head in his hands. It reflected his despair and the disappointment of a packed Court Three crowd who had rushed for the non-allocated seats to see a maverick player who is normally an acrobatic crowd-pleaser. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 3, 2017   Australia’s Nick Kyrgios reacts during his first round match against France’s Pierre-Hugues HerbertTony O'BrienIndeed, such is his usual self-belief, Kyrgios said he could have had a chance of victory against a different player.  I thought I could win. Obviously, probably not against him, but some opponents if I played them today, I probably still could have won,  he said. Slideshow (3 Images)Kyrgios, who had never lost in the first round at Wimbledon, reached the last 16 last year before being beaten by eventual champion Andy Murray. He made it to the quarter-finals in 2014, losing to Canada's Milos Raonic, and for Australian great Rod Laver, he is a man who can reach the top if he stays injury-free and works out his training regime and discipline.  I think Nick can win Wimbledon one year, he has the firepower and the variety and he can volley,  he told Reuters in the run-up to the tournament.   I think he has certainly got the potential. But I wonder if he is fit enough. Could he be a bit more flexible? His back gets sore, the shoulder goes out, the legs get sore. He is prone to injury and in long five setters, I don't know.

Market forecasts for the inflation rate in 2020 dropped to 4.00 percent, matching the new official target, from a previous estimate of 4.25 percent, according to the median estimate of about 100 economists surveyed weekly by the central bank.     For 2017 and 2018, when Brazil's target remained at the long-held 4.5 percent, economists expect an inflation rate of 3.46 percent and 4.25 percent, respectively, down from a forecast of 3.48 percent and 4.30 percent previously.     Estimates for the 2019 inflation rate remained unchanged at 4.25 percent, the new goal for that year.     Well-anchored inflation expectations have helped the central bank cut interest rates to help the economy emerge from its worst recession on record. Policymakers have slashed the benchmark Selic rate by 400 basis points since October, to 10.25 percent, and are expected to cut it further until it reaches 8.25 percent by December, according to the weekly poll.     Until last week, economists had expected the central bank to cut the Selic rate to 8.5 percent this year.     Brazil lowered its annual inflation target on Thursday, seeking to turn the page on recent double-digit jumps in consumer prices. Latin American countries such as Mexico and Chile target inflation at 3 percent.                  Growing investor optimism about Brazil's economic prospects contrasts with an escalating political crisis that threatens to remove President Michel Temer from office.

Britain's Veritas Mining Limited, Ghassan Spain Investment, and Egypt's East Gas Company won a concession each while Resolute Egypt won two, El Molla said in a statement. Egypt is hoping that gold production can be a future source of growth for its struggling economy. It began accepting bids in January for five concessions in its first tender for new gold exploration since 2009. The deadline for bids was April 20 and the result was due in May. The level of interest from bidders was not expected to be very great because Egypt's commercial terms for mining have been criticized by investors for using an unprofitable model for exploration. Centamin, the operator of the country's only commercial gold mine, has previously said that the terms were not competitive enough to take part in the bidding. Egypt recently established a free economic zone dedicated to mining known as the Golden Triangle because of its location in an area of the Eastern Desert with gold mining potential. The country hopes this will attract global mining investors which have shunned Egypt until now because of the commercial terms.

The Reuters article, published on Thursday, detailed how police have been sending corpses of drug suspects to hospital after they were killed in anti-drug operations. Witnesses and family members said the suspects were executed and their bodies removed in a police cover up.[tmsnrt.rs/2sniZqn] Interviewed for the article, Metro Manila Police Chief Oscar Albayalde promised to investigate the findings, which were based on eight months of official crime data and interviews with witnesses, family members, doctors and police.  National Police Chief Ronald dela Rosa, who declined to be interviewed for the piece, challenged its contents on Friday and said police are not medically qualified to determine whether a victim is dead or alive. A spokeswoman for Reuters said the news agency stood by its reporting.     On Monday, responding to an opposition call for an investigation of Reuters' findings, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs told Reuters there would be an inquiry.  I will conduct an inquiry basically because there are witnesses named in the Reuters report,  added the chairman, Senator Panfilo Lacson. Witnesses are invited to testify under oath.  The Senate is small, with only 24 seats, but its members are influential. They include Manny Pacquiao, the boxing champion, and Lacson, a former national police chief. The Senate has also been home to Duterte’s fiercest critics. FILE PHOTO: A policeman stands guard near the body of a suspected drug pusher, whom police investigators said was shot and killed by unidentified men, along a street in Quezon city, metro Manila, Philippines March 1, 2017.Romeo Ranoco/File PhotoSince the drug war began, senators have grilled top police officers and former hitmen in often sensational televised hearings that have enraged Duterte and mesmerized millions of Filipinos.   There was no immediate response from Duterte's office to the Senate move. The Reuters report, based on data from two of Metro Manila's five police districts for the first eight months of the drug war, showed that of 301 victims sent to hospital after police anti-drug operations only two survived. The rest were dead on arrival. In July 2016, the first month of the drug war, there were 10 dead-on-arrival cases, or 13 percent of police drug shooting deaths. By January 2017, the tally had risen to 51 cases, or 85 percent. A police commander who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said the increase was not a coincidence and police were trying to prevent crime scene investigations and media attention that might show they were executing suspects. In a three-page resolution calling for an inquiry, opposition Senator Antonio Trillanes also cited an earlier Reuters report that described how police were paid to kill drug suspects and plant evidence. A police spokesman at the time called the payment claim  implausible . No date has been fixed for the inquiry. The Senate resumes at the end of July.

NSE submitted an application for an initial public offering (IPO) in December, which bankers have said could raise as much as $1 billion. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), however, has yet to approve the listing amid an ongoing regulatory probe into whether India's biggest exchange had provided unfair access to its servers to some brokers.  NSE said at the time that an auditor it had hired to look into the issue could not conclusively determine whether any collusion had happened between its employees and market participants, spurring the regulator to look for a forensic auditor to further probe into the matter. SEBI Chairman Tyagi suggested on Monday that it wanted the NSE to address the probe first and then left open the prospect the exchange would need to refile the eagerly anticipated IPO.  I think they themselves have to do it,  Tyagi told reporters on the sidelines of an event when pressed about whether the NSE would need to update its application with new information, including an update to its financial statements. The NSE declined to comment. The NSE has sought to move ahead with its listing, proposing to settle it with the regulator through the payment of a penalty, according to two sources familiar with the matter. SEBI has not said whether it would be open to a settlement. In a welcome development for the exchange, SEBI last month conditionally approved the appointment of Vikram Limaye, head of infrastructure lender IDFC Ltd (IDFC.NS), as the next chief executive of NSE, removing a key hurdle. NSE's older rival BSE Ltd BSEI.NS listed in early February and has seen its share surge 33 percent from its IPO price as the bourse has benefited from a record-setting rally in share markets that are expected to improve profits.

NSE submitted an application for an initial public offering (IPO) in December, which bankers have said could raise as much as $1 billion. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), however, has yet to approve the listing amid an ongoing regulatory probe into whether India's biggest exchange had provided unfair access to its servers to some brokers.  NSE said at the time that an auditor it had hired to look into the issue could not conclusively determine whether any collusion had happened between its employees and market participants, spurring the regulator to look for a forensic auditor to further probe into the matter. SEBI Chairman Tyagi suggested on Monday that it wanted the NSE to address the probe first and then left open the prospect the exchange would need to refile the eagerly anticipated IPO.  I think they themselves have to do it,  Tyagi told reporters on the sidelines of an event when pressed about whether the NSE would need to update its application with new information, including an update to its financial statements. The NSE declined to comment. The NSE has sought to move ahead with its listing, proposing to settle it with the regulator through the payment of a penalty, according to two sources familiar with the matter. SEBI has not said whether it would be open to a settlement. In a welcome development for the exchange, SEBI last month conditionally approved the appointment of Vikram Limaye, head of infrastructure lender IDFC Ltd (IDFC.NS), as the next chief executive of NSE, removing a key hurdle. NSE's older rival BSE Ltd BSEI.NS listed in early February and has seen its share surge 33 percent from its IPO price as the bourse has benefited from a record-setting rally in share markets that are expected to improve profits.

Arne Schoenbohm, president of Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), said authorities had set up a 24/7 special command center to defend against such attacks, just as it was preparing for any physical violence.   We're preparing intensively for every form of protest,  Schoenbohm said in an interview.   As the national cyber security agency ... we're concerned about everything from (persistent threats) to groups like Anonymous and Lulzsec that could be planning political protests using cyber attacks.  Schoenboehm said the agency had no information about  specific attacks, but had been carrying out so-called  penetration  tests to ensure the safety of computer networks involved when the leaders of the 20 major economies meet on July 7-8.  Dozens of cyber experts were standing by to respond to any attack, he said. Some 20,000 police with dogs, horses and helicopters will be deployed to deal with tens of thousands of expected protesters in Hamburg. Schoenboehm said the government realized people could protest virtually as well.  You don't have to come in from 100 kilometers or 1,000 kilometers,  he said.  In cyber space you just start programming. That's faster than in the real world.  He said German cyber officials had been and remained in close touch with their counterparts in other G20 countries, including the United States to protect computer networks, surveillance cameras and other security equipment. Germany holds national elections in September. APT 28, a Russian hacker group that experts say has links to the Russian government, is believed to be behind attacks on the German parliament, political parties and think tanks. Schoenboehm said the attacks were continuing, with a clear aim to securing information that could be used to affect the election. Last week, the BSI said it had seen a fresh wave of spearphishing attacks aimed at businesses and government that use emails to get users to click on links that download malicious software. BSI has been working closely with German political parties and lawmakers to raise their security awareness and bolster security, but risks remain, Schoenbohm said. He said BSI would review Germany's  Vote-Meter,  a government-generated computer program that allows voters to compare their views with party programs, to ensure it was properly secured, he said.  We will be looking at that carefully in coming weeks,  he said.

The 29-year-old Eritrean community organizer now works as a cook at a restaurant in south Tel Aviv -- alone, without family and in legal limbo, awaiting a response to his asylum request. Since May, Michael's life has faced another challenge with new tax rules that force his employer to put part of his salary in a fund which he can access only if he leaves Israel.  He believes the aim of the new legislation, which applies only to African migrants and asylum seekers, is clear.  They want us to leave the country,  said Michael, who left his homeland rather than serve in an army accused by human rights groups of treating conscripts brutally and forcing them to serve indefinitely.  They want to break our spirit.  The Interior Ministry says the new rules are intended to benefit the migrants and asylum seekers, whom the government refers to as illegal infiltrators.   (It provides) a sum of money that the person will have when he leaves,  said Sabine Haddad, a spokeswoman for the ministry's population, immigration and border authority.    Since its creation in 1948, Israel has been a haven for Jews fleeing persecution. But for nearly a decade, it has struggled to deal with tens of thousands of non-Jewish Africans who entered the country illegally, seeking asylum or work.  Many have lived for years in Israel and spent time in a desert holding center waiting for their asylum requests to be considered, allowed by the government to have jobs even though their temporary visas do not give them the right to work.    Israel has granted asylum to fewer than 1 percent of those who have applied and has a years-long backlog of applicants.  Calculated Plan  Under the new law, employers must deduct 20 percent of the wages of Eritrean and Sudanese employees who entered Israel illegally from Egypt and have temporary visas. The sum is then deposited in a fund, alongside an employer-paid tax of 16 percent, and remains there until the worker leaves Israel.  It is too early to know what effect the new law is having on asylum seekers or their employers, and how many migrants will decide to leave because of it. The government says it will take several months to know the full impact.  Businesses that rely on migrant labor say costs will rise, and rights groups say Israel is not abiding by its international legal obligations. The government denies this but the Hotline for Refugees and Migrant Workers, an Israeli non-governmental organization, is challenging the law in Israel's High Court.  (It's) a very calculated plan to make sure that people understand they are not welcome,  said Ruvi Ziegler, associate professor in international refugee law at the University of Reading and a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute. Large numbers of Africans, the vast majority from Eritrea and Sudan, began entering Israel illegally from Egypt in the mid-2000S. Many said they fled war and persecution as well as economic hardship but Israel treats them as economic migrants.  FILE PHOTO: An African migrant gestures during a protest, held by women and children of the migrant community, against Israel's detention policy toward migrants, in Tel Aviv, Israel January 15, 2014.Ronen Zvulun/File PhotoBy 2013, Israel had mostly completed a high-security fence along the 245-km (150-mile) border, all but halting the influx. By then, an estimated 55,000 people had entered the country, according to Interior Ministry figures. Several thousand have left since then. Some received asylum in countries such as Canada and others accepted an Israeli offer to go to a third country in Africa -- usually Rwanda or Uganda -- in exchange for money, though refugee advocacy groups say the plight of many of these migrants has since worsened.  Many of those who remain have learnt Hebrew and fill jobs in restaurants, hotels and other services which aid groups say most Israelis do not want to do.   A Cancer  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the migrants' presence a threat to Israel's social fabric and Jewish identity and some of his supporters have referred to it as  a cancer . Slideshow (11 Images)Some Africans have been beaten up by Israeli youths, and a Darfuri man was killed in one such assault last year. Aid workers say that since the new law was implemented, there has been an increase in reports of asylum seekers being fired from jobs because of the tax.  No government figures are available on this, but the aid workers say some migrants are recording only some of the hours they work, and are being paid on the side for the rest, to reduce the taxes paid by both the employer and employee. Lemlem, an Eritrean who declined to give her full name, said she had lost her job in a clothes store in Tel Aviv because her  employer did not want to pay the increased tax.  Lemlem, 29, has a six-year-old daughter and her husband is unemployed. She does not know how she will pay her 1,800-shekel  ($515) monthly rent.   Eritrean people are scared,  she said.  Employers are having problems budgeting for the new tax and signing up employees for the fund because of technical difficulties, said Shai Berman, general manager of the Israeli Restaurant Association.      The government has denied the association's request for more time to process payments for May, and a promised reduction of the tax has not yet been approved, Berman said.  It's a mess,  he said.  We have a big problem.  Some employers say that, in the meantime, they may have to raise salaries to help asylum seekers get by.   It's not only for the asylum seeker -- for us in the restaurants it's going to be very, very hard,  said Ido Breier, manager of a Tel Aviv branch of Pasta Basta restaurant chain.

Goldman Sachs gave the biggest boost to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while Bank of America and JPMorgan helped lift the S&P; 500 index. All 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, topped by the financial index's 0.78 percent gain. Trading volume is expected to be light, with the U.S. market closing early at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT). It will be shut on Tuesday for Independence Day. On Friday, the S&P; 500 scored its biggest gain for the first half of the year since 2013, while the Nasdaq Composite's first-half gain was its best in eight years.  The start to the third quarter is getting off on a promising note as the futures point to a higher opening in pre-holiday volume,  said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial.  On the domestic front, we look for mixed-to-positive manufacturing data and a slight uptick in construction spending. In this abbreviated trading session, we look for positive market action as investors focus turns to the economy.

The gunmen also tried to seize refugees from Gbari in the first reported attacks on Ugandan soil since the start of South Sudan's civil war, locals told Reuters.  I am afraid, they may come ... and burn all the houses,  said Martin Koma, 44, from the village.  South Sudan's army denied any involvement. But the reports will alarm regional and world powers, struggling to contain ethnically-charged killings and atrocities that the U.N. has warned could lead to genocide. South Sudanese gunmen have already killed and kidnapped hundreds in cross-border raids in Ethiopia. Koma said about 26 gunmen attacked Gbari on the morning of June 17, identifying themselves as South Sudanese military and taking 108 cattle. Three days later, a second group attacked and arrested two South Sudanese refugees living in the village.   One ran away, the second one because ... he looks like Dinka, they left him,  Koma said. The military is dominated by the Dinka, the president's ethnic group.  Koma said the gunmen were very hostile to the first man, from South Sudan's minority Kuku tribe, before he got away.     Ugandan military spokesman Brigadier Richard Karemire confirmed the raids on Gbari, without commenting on who carried them out. South Sudan's military denied involvement, saying is had received no complaint from Uganda and that the gunmen could have been anyone wearing South Sudanese uniforms.   This is untrue,  military spokesman Colonel Santo Domic Chol told Reuters.  This is completely negative propaganda by somebody ... trying to tarnish the image of the (military).       Atrocities U.N. bodies and rights groups have accused both Sudan's army and the rebel groups it is fighting of atrocities in the conflict that erupted just two years after South Sudan declared independence from Sudan. Fighting started spreading in December 2013 after President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, fired his vice president and long-term rival, Riek Machar, a Nuer.  The explosion of ethnic violence that followed has uprooted nearly a quarter of the country's population of 12 million, creating the biggest refugee crisis since the genocide in Rwanda, another of Uganda's neighbors. Nearly a million South Sudanese have fled to neighboring Uganda, many from minority tribes. Ugandan authorities have tightened security at refugee camps in recent days, fearing armed groups could try and abduct refugees from rival ethnic groups, police said.   We have increased our intelligence and security alertness ... because of signs some bad elements could want to cause insecurity in the camps,  said Musiho Abubakar, the police commander in Uganda's northwestern Yumbe district.  Last month, Ugandan soldiers shot a South Sudanese man they suspected of plotting to harm refugees, a security source in Yumbe said. Yumbe hosts Bidi Bidi camp, a sprawling, semi-arid stretch of red, stony earth home to 270,000 South Sudanese refugees.  The man entered Uganda via a border village near Gbari, said officials. Locals reported him to the military on June 22.  Ugandan soldiers confronted him, but  instead of raising his hands, he wanted to pick a pistol from his pocket, then UPDF (Ugandan soldiers) shot him,  the source said. A medical official said the man had been taken to a health center in Yumbe town with an injured arm. Police and soldiers were guarding him, the official said. Reuters could not reach him for comment.  He was planning to come ... and start killing government enemies one by one,  the security source said, without going into further details. Karemire confirmed the incident, saying that the armed man had described himself as a South Sudanese brigadier general, though his own investigations indicated he was a lieutenant.  South Sudanese military spokesman Chol denied any knowledge of the man. Editing by Andrew Heavens","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-southsudan-violence-idUSKBN19O1JX"},

Total will be the operator with a 50.1 percent stake, alongside Chinese state-owned oil and gas company CNPC with 30 percent, and National Iranian Oil Co subsidiary Petropars with 19.9 percent. The project will have a production capacity of 2 billion cubic feet per day, or 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day including condensate, Total said in a statement, adding that the gas will supply the Iranian domestic market starting in 2021. The first stage of the South Pars development will cost around $2 billion, Total added.         The project will cost up to $5 billion and production is expected to start within 40 months, Iran's oil ministry said in a statement.   This is a major agreement for Total, which officially marks our return to Iran to open a new page in the history of our partnership with the country,  Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said. The offshore field was first developed in the 1990s. Total was one of the biggest investors in Iran until the country drew international sanctions in 2006 over suspicions that Tehran was trying to develop nuclear arms. Total signed an initial agreement with Tehran on Nov. 8, a day after the U.S. presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who had criticized the deal lifting sanctions against Iran. Total had delayed the final investment decision as it waited for the Trump administration to renew the U.S. sanctions waivers. Trump extended sanctions relief for Iran in May, but is imposing new measures against Iran's ballistic missile program. Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, hopes its new petroleum contracts will attract foreign companies and boost oil and gas output after years of under-investment. A senior Iranian official said at the signing ceremony that he hoped the deal with Total would encourage other international companies to invest in Iran’s oil and gas fields, which need tens of billions of dollars of foreign money.  This contract will send a strong political message to the world especially at the time that the Americans have adopted a confrontational course (against Iran),  Iran's SHANA news agency quoted the head of the country's petroleum contracts committee, Mehdi Hosseini, as saying.  This shows that the world is not following their path,  Hosseini was quoted as saying. He added that experience has shown that after a deal with Total, other European and Asian companies would sign deals with Iran. “In the 1990s, the French were the first who took the risk and invested in South Pars, but ended up paying a huge penalty to the United States later. They are taking the same risk again,” said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East. “However, phase 11 of South Pars is twice the size of other phases, a lucrative opportunity that cannot be ignored,” he added.

Saudi Arabia edged up on the back of petrochemicals. Qatar's foreign minister arrived in Kuwait, which is acting as mediator, to respond to the demands. There is still no clear sign that Doha will accept enough of the demands to satisfy the four states or that the dispute will be resolved. If not, fresh sanctions could be imposed - Saudi Arabia's Okaz newspaper reported that boycotting countries would ask international companies to choose between doing business with them or with Qatar. But the Doha index, which had tumbled 2.3 percent on Sunday, rebounded 1.3 percent in modest trading volume. Foreign funds were net buyers for a third straight day, this time by a wide margin, bourse data showed; they accounted for roughly two-fifths of market turnover. Doha Bank, a constituent of both the MSCI emerging market index and the FTSE Russell emerging index , added 3.3 percent. Telecommunications operator Ooredoo, also a member of both benchmarks, jumped 5.8 percent. Local funds and other Gulf funds were net sellers on Monday. In Dubai, the index rose 1.2 percent. Shares favoured by short-term retail traders were the most active, with GFH Financial soaring 6.3 percent and property developer DAMAC jumping 7.5 percent. In Abu Dhabi, Dana Gas, the most heavily traded share, surged 6.1 percent after saying it had rescheduled to Thursday a telephone call with investors on restructuring its outstanding $700 million of sukuk. A previously planned call did not go ahead after Dana said a media report had  mischaracterised  the event. Dana is claiming it must exchange the instruments for new ones at lower profit rates, which could be positive for its earnings as coupon cash outlays fall. Blue-chip banks, however, dragged the Abu Dhabi index 0.7 percent lower. First Abu Dhabi Bank lost 2.4 percent. The Riyadh index finished 0.1 percent higher at a fresh 21-month closing high after a late rise, posting its fourth consecutive session of gains. It had lost as much as 1.7 percent during the day. Some of the previous session's top gainers diverged; dairy maker Almarai dropped 1.5 percent on profit-taking but Banque Saudi Fransi added 3.0 percent. Petrochemical shares were firm as Brent oil headed back near $50 a barrel. Nine of the 14 listed producers rose; National Industrialization  (Tasne'e) was the best performer, adding 2.0 percent. Egypt's index fell 0.4 percent as property management company Amer Group lost 2.6 percent. Regional funds have turned slightly bearish towards Egyptian equities, according to a monthly poll published by Reuters last Thursday.

Last week, with Qatari banks closed for five days of Eid al-Fitr holidays, foreign banks made nervous by the sanctions lacked onshore counterparties and traded the riyal QAR=D1 among themselves as low as 3.81 to the dollar, Reuters data showed. That was far below the peg of 3.64, fuelling talk among some foreign traders that the sanctions against Qatar by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt might eventually force the peg to be abandoned. On Monday, however, Qatari banks were back in the market and once more accounting for most activity. The riyal changed hands at 3.6415 in the afternoon, after trading in a range of 3.6371 to 3.7331 earlier in the day.  State-owned Qatar National Bank, the Gulf's biggest listed bank, which is widely seen as an arm of Qatari government policy, was providing indicative quotes for the riyal QAR= at 3.6405/25 - unchanged from levels before the diplomatic crisis erupted in early June.   The market is reflecting reality again,  said one Qatari banker, who attributed last week's low rates for the riyal to poor liquidity among foreign banks as well as speculation. The four Arab states have cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, accusing it of backing terrorism. That prompted many Gulf and foreign banks, including several major British institutions, to halt or scale back their trading of the riyal. The withdrawal of so many traders has created bottlenecks in the market, particularly between onshore and offshore banks, reducing supplies of dollars to offshore institutions and prompting them to quote the riyal lower. But at onshore banks, not much has changed; the central bank is continuing to provide them with ample supplies of dollars for commercial purposes at a rate of up to 3.6415 under its peg mechanism, commercial bankers said. Ample Reserves For many countries, the emergence of a gap between rates quoted by onshore and offshore traders has signaled a severe shortage of foreign currency and an eventual devaluation.  Egypt, for example, devalued last November after its pound weakened by more than 50 percent offshore and dollar holders were no longer willing to sell at the onshore rate, starving Egyptian banks of hard currency. Qatar's case may be different, however. Most of its foreign income comes from oil and gas industries controlled by the government, which can ensure that dollar supplies are remitted home. And the hundreds of billions of dollars in its sovereign wealth fund would cover more than a decade of imports. In an effort to allay doubts about trade in its currency, Qatar's central bank republished a statement on Monday saying the riyal's exchange rate was stable and that it would guarantee all exchange transactions for customers inside and outside the country. The statement was originally published last week. The four Arab states have set a deadline of late Tuesday for Qatar to comply with their political demands, and have threatened additional, unspecified sanctions if the deadline is not met. It is not clear, however, that the new sanctions would increase pressure on the riyal significantly. Gulf banks may withdraw deposits from Qatari banks, but Qatari authorities have more than enough funds to cover such withdrawals. Saudi Arabian media have also said foreign companies may be told to choose between doing business in the four states or trading with Qatar.  Such a  secondary boycott  could be hard to enforce and break World Trade Organisation rules, however. A secondary boycott of Israel by Gulf Arab states was canceled in the 1990s, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

The Qataris were sent to the region after clashes broke out between Eritrea and Djibouti in 2008, but they were pulled out without warning on June 14. Qatar gave no reason for the withdrawal, but it came days after both Djibouti and Eritrea sided with Gulf Arab nations that had broken off relations with Qatar.  The Qatari forces left on short notice without really preparing the ground. Leaving the status quo was not in the best interest of both countries,  Djiboutian Foreign Minister Mahamoud Ali Youssouf told Reuters during a summit of African Union leaders in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.   We proposed to the African Union that it take over the disputed side and fill the gap. We need the African Union to act very quickly,  Youssouf said.     A dozen Djiboutian troops were killed and dozens wounded in the 2008 clashes with Eritrea. The fighting erupted after Djibouti accused Eritrea of sending troops across the border. Amid fears the conflict would escalate and spread, the U.N. Security Council requested that both sides withdraw. Qatari volunteered to mediate the dispute and deploy observers. After Qatar pulled its troops out of the region, Djibouti accused Eritrea of occupying the disputed Dumeira area along their border.  In the beginning, there were a limited number of Eritrean troops in the disputed areas. But then they pulled back,  Youssouf said.  The African Union has called on both sides to exercise restraint and said it would deploy a fact-finding mission to the disputed area. Diplomats said Eritrea has not yet responded to that request. Youssouf said a potential African Union deployment could involve conflict-prevention experts or members of a regional  standby force  the union is setting up.

Total will be the operator with a 50.1 percent stake, alongside Chinese state-owned oil and gas company CNPC with 30 percent, and National Iranian Oil Co subsidiary Petropars with 19.9 percent. The project will have a production capacity of 2 billion cubic feet per day, or 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day including condensate, Total said in a statement, adding that the gas will supply the Iranian domestic market starting in 2021. The first stage of the South Pars development will cost around $2 billion, Total added.         The project will cost up to $5 billion and production is expected to start within 40 months, Iran's oil ministry said in a statement.   This is a major agreement for Total, which officially marks our return to Iran to open a new page in the history of our partnership with the country,  Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said. The offshore field was first developed in the 1990s. Total was one of the biggest investors in Iran until the country drew international sanctions in 2006 over suspicions that Tehran was trying to develop nuclear arms. Total signed an initial agreement with Tehran on Nov. 8, a day after the U.S. presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who had criticized the deal lifting sanctions against Iran. Total had delayed the final investment decision as it waited for the Trump administration to renew the U.S. sanctions waivers. Trump extended sanctions relief for Iran in May, but is imposing new measures against Iran's ballistic missile program. Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, hopes its new petroleum contracts will attract foreign companies and boost oil and gas output after years of under-investment. A senior Iranian official said at the signing ceremony that he hoped the deal with Total would encourage other international companies to invest in Iran’s oil and gas fields, which need tens of billions of dollars of foreign money.  This contract will send a strong political message to the world especially at the time that the Americans have adopted a confrontational course (against Iran),  Iran's SHANA news agency quoted the head of the country's petroleum contracts committee, Mehdi Hosseini, as saying.  This shows that the world is not following their path,  Hosseini was quoted as saying. He added that experience has shown that after a deal with Total, other European and Asian companies would sign deals with Iran. “In the 1990s, the French were the first who took the risk and invested in South Pars, but ended up paying a huge penalty to the United States later. They are taking the same risk again,” said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East. “However, phase 11 of South Pars is twice the size of other phases, a lucrative opportunity that cannot be ignored,” he added.

Video of the raid, released by police on Monday, showed officers with riot shields and pistols drawn breaking down the door of an apartment and the bound victim being told:  Be calm. We're police. You're free . Police said they had arrested four people in the town of Casarrubios del Monte in the central province of Toledo and another in Madrid in connection with the incident. The victim, who has not been named, was kidnapped from his home in the Catalonian province of Girona in June by a gang who beat and drugged him before forcing him into a car at gunpoint, according to police. The victim's wife received a telephone call demanding 1.5 million euros in exchange for his being released alive. Police said last week's raid was launched moments before the ransom was due to be handed over to the kidnappers in a car park. The gang had previously operated in Eastern Europe, they said. Its alleged ringleader is a Romanian citizen who had studied medicine in Madrid and was working in a hospital there. He is alleged to have procured the drugs used to sedate the victim, police said. The victim was described as a Serbian who was also a naturalized Dutch citizen. He was taken to hospital to receive treatment for his injuries.

However, 'frontier' market (FM) countries are now starting to see an improvement in trade growth, according to Fitch Ratings' latest 'Frontier Vision' chart pack. FM economies, like emerging markets more generally, suffered significant macroeconomic pressures in the wake of the 2014 and 2015 commodity price collapse.  GDP growth in FM economies averaged around 3% in 2016 (weighted by 2015 GDP in USD terms), down from 4% in 2015. The slowdown was driven mainly by Nigeria, Angola and Ecuador. FM growth has slowed continuously over the last three years from a rate of 5% recorded in 2013. This is partly explained by the knock-on effects of weaker commodity prices on domestic income and spending. However, the latest data also show trade growth picking up across most countries. Three-quarters of FM countries are currently seeing faster growth in exports or imports compared with a year ago. The pick-up in exports in Asian FMs, including Mongolia and Vietnam, is particularly pronounced. This is consistent with the pick-up in world trade recently highlighted in Fitch's June 2017 Global Economic Outlook. Fitch's Frontier Vision chart pack tracks high frequency macroeconomic data for the 33 countries included in JP Morgan's Next Generation Market Index (NEXGEM). The charts cover five years of historical data and the choice of data series has been harmonised as far as possible across all countries to facilitate comparisons. The index comprises 33 countries representing Sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Europe and Asia.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Her fragile minority government is under mounting pressure to spend more on a range of fronts. Loosening the purse strings would help both the economy and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. Members of May’s own cabinet are calling for the government to abandon a 1 percent cap on pay hikes for public employees, which is squeezing the disposable incomes of nurses and teachers. Allowing public sector pay to rise at the same rate as the private sector would cost an extra 6.3 billion pounds in 2019-20, rising to 9.2 billion pounds in 2021-22, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates. Nor would this be the only unscheduled call on the public purse. The government has pledged 1 billion pounds extra for Northern Ireland over two years as a quid pro quo for securing the support of the province's biggest Protestant party. Planned cuts of 3 billion pounds in funding for local authorities may be revisited after the deadly fire in a London tower block. Meanwhile, slower-than-expected growth will depress tax receipts. Too much is in flux at this stage for private economists to form an accurate picture of the slippage in the budget. But most agree that Finance Minister Philip Hammond is increasingly likely to miss his goal of turning a budget deficit that was worth 46.6 billion pounds, or 2.4 percent of GDP, in the last financial year into a surplus by the mid-2020s. That’s especially true as the government is unlikely to have much appetite for unpopular tax hikes. That’s not great news for the UK gilt market, since bond prices typically fall when governments borrow more. But it could give the Bank of England an opportunity to raise rates to rein in inflation and curb consumer borrowing, which has been growing at double-digit rates. For seven years, Britain has combined tight controls on spending with loose monetary policy. Changing the mix now makes sense. Conveniently, self-interest may force politicians to do the right thing.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Security at this year's Bastille Day parade on the Champs Elysees is likely to be even tighter than usual given the expected presence of U.S. President Donald Trump. In 2002, Maxime Brunerie, a neo-Nazi, fired a sports rifle at then President Jacques Chirac at the Bastille Day parade, before then being overpowered. Chirac was not harmed.

Partly by dint of his recent form, which also saw him finish fourth at the US Open, and partly by accident of birth, he will be under the spotlight this month when the British Open is staged at Royal Birkdale, a few miles up the Lancashire coast from Fleetwood's Southport birthplace. It should prove an emotional homecoming for the local lad who used to sneak into one of England's most prestigious clubs to hit a few shots because his tarmac-layer father could not afford the sky-high green fees. Money, of course, is no longer an issue and Sunday's $1.3 million pay check from Le Golf National took his 2017 earnings to $2.4 million and career winnings past the $11 million mark. That eye-watering figure will rise further should he become the first English winner of a British Open for 25 years later this month.  Birkdale is going to be a massive week for me,  he said last month.  I'm going to be playing in front of crowds that I never have before and people that I have grown up with. It's going to be an amazing experience from start to finish.  Fleetwood's engaging manner makes him a natural for the media glare which will surround him. But the formbook suggests Fleetwood has every right to be considered among the favorites to win at the links course he knows better than anyone. Sunday's win was his second of the season and third of his career, and he is 800,000 pounds ($1.0 million) ahead of second-placed Sergio Garcia, the US Masters champion, in the Race to Dubai money list.  That is a real goal now,  Fleetwood said on Sunday.  It's difficult because I was a long way ahead early on and then Sergio won the Masters and then I was a million points behind. But yeah, it's great to be leading the Race to Dubai.   It is something that I'll look at now and no matter what happens, come the last event, I'm going to have a chance of winning the Order of Merit. That's something that will be very special.  Life's just been great. I'm engaged, expecting a baby, my fiancée is my manager, my caddie's one of my best mates in the world. Thommo (Alan Thompson), I think, is the best coach in the world – everybody around me I have really strong relationships with, and when you enjoy doing your job that's a massive positive.  And it will get even better should he secure a British Open victory in front of his home fans on the course that helped forge his career.

Trading volume is expected to be light, with the U.S. market closing early at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT). It will be shut on Tuesday for Independence Day. On Friday, the S&P; 500 scored its biggest gain for the first half of the year since 2013, while the Nasdaq Composite's first-half gain was its best in eight years.  The start to the third quarter is getting off on a promising note as the futures point to a higher opening in pre-holiday volume,  said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial.  On the domestic front, we look for mixed-to-positive manufacturing data and a slight uptick in construction spending. In this abbreviated trading session, we look for positive market action as investors focus turns to the economy.  The Institute for Supply Management's U.S. factory activity for June is expected to have increased to a reading of 55.1 from 54.9 in May. The data is expected at 10 a.m. ET.

Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 19.75 points, or 0.35 percent, on volume of 22,362 contracts. U.S. companies will start reporting second-quarter results in the coming weeks and investors will be keen on knowing as to how their earnings stack up against lofty market valuations. The S&P; 500 companies are expected to post an 8 percent rise in earnings, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P; 500 index has been trading at about 18 times forward earnings, compared with the long-term average of 15 times. Shares of Tesla were up 2 percent in premarket trading after the luxury electric-car maker said it would deliver its mass-market Model 3 sedan to first 30 customers on July 28. Bank of America edged up 0.8 percent after Berkshire Hathaway invoked its right to acquire 700 million shares of the bank, making it the lender's top shareholder. Bankrate jumped 9 percent after the company said it would be bought by digital marketing company Red Ventures for $1.24 billion.

That move, which confirmed a Reuters report, raised concerns among some insiders and customers about a possible power struggle with long-standing airplanes boss Fabrice Bregier, though Airbus denied any tensions.  Cementing changes first outlined last year, the  one Airbus  reorganization involves a single headquarters in Toulouse, France, with Bregier confirmed as group-wide chief operating officer and president of commercial aircraft.  We need to become more integrated, more collaborative and less bureaucratic for speedier decision-making and execution,  Enders said in a letter to employees. The revamp, which saves hundreds of millions of euros in overheads, is designed to complete a decade-long drive to turn the former European consortium - with a history of strong French and German government influence - into a more normal company, and prepare for digital innovations sweeping through industry. But in an unexpected adjustment reported by Reuters on Friday, Airbus said its commercial sales team, best known for contesting leadership of the jet market with Boeing (BA.N), would now report directly to Enders and by-pass Bregier.      That decision is seen as sensitive because it revisits a power-sharing deal between the German Enders and Frenchman Bregier that initially gave the latter responsibility over all planemaking activities. Enders said in his commercial aircraft role, Bregier would lead programs, support and services, engineering, manufacturing, procurement and quality.   However, due to the heavy operational challenges in our largest revenue-driving business, and to slightly rebalance our internal burden-sharing, I will lead sales and marketing,  he said in his letter. The decision sent tremors though the commercial arm and raised questions over the future of Bregier, an industrial and marketing heavyweight whose ties to Enders are seen as key to Airbus's ability to smooth output and face a resurgent Boeing.  People are very surprised. There is no doubt that this is an important step,  a person close to the company said. A jet financier expressed  surprise  at the move, given well-established relations between many airlines and Bregier. Other critics said the sudden move reflected a heavy-handed new management style or risked being perceived as a weakening of French interests.  It is creating a culture in which people will go back to 'Germans versus French' and people having to choose which camp they are in. It is not good for morale or the culture of the company,  said a person with detailed knowledge of the group. An Airbus spokesman called it a routine internal matter of reporting lines, as with any normal company. Political Test The new structure comes almost 10 years to the day after leaders of France and Germany agreed in Toulouse to abolish a system of dual control over the company, with the CEO role shared between two people, one French and one German. Enders had to wait another five years to become sole CEO of the group and another year beyond that to reduce the political influence of French and German government shareholders. Both now own 11 percent but their power is limited under a 2013 overhaul. Analysts say Paris and Berlin have generally had their attention elsewhere during the euro zone crisis but that their hands-off approach remains to be tested against a recently softening market for jets, with thousands of jobs at stake. Airbus also faces a raft of politically charged decisions, such as how long to keep building its slow-selling A380 or its response to corruption probes in Britain, France and Austria. Despite resisting interference, Enders appeared to recognize the significance of French politics to Airbus by writing a letter of support in the familiar 'tu' form to then-presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, which many in Paris saw as a gaffe. Enders is, however, convinced Airbus has to find a new agility to cope with the way 'Big Data' and simultaneous breakthroughs in other technologies are creating opportunities for newcomers such as U.S. rocket maker SpaceX. He acknowledged the new reorganization, which unions say could affect over 1,000 jobs, would be  uncomfortable  for some. But he told staff Airbus was  waving goodbye to an era in which a return to 'stability' was a realistic aspiration .

The government will also ease foreign ownership restrictions on certain industry sectors in August, Widodo said in an interview at the presidential palace in Jakarta on Monday. For the first time in almost 20 years, Indonesia is rated investment grade by all three major rating agencies after S&P; on May 19 raised its outlook to 'BBB-' from 'BB+', matching the ratings already awarded by Fitch and Moody's.     The upgrade was  very important  because it would encourage more capital inflows and reduce borrowing costs, said Widodo, a former Jakarta governor who was elected to lead Southeast Asia's biggest economy in 2014.  Now the pension funds look to Indonesia,  he said, adding that some of the money will go into the country's stock and bond markets.  After that the companies here can take and invest to the real sector, to the infrastructure, to the factory.  While growth in Indonesia's gross domestic product has slowed from a peak of more than 6 percent several years ago to around 5 percent due to a commodity downturn, its vast domestic market is still seen as an engine of growth. Foreign companies have complained that vested interests are blocking them from gaining more access to the country of 250 million people, at a time when neighbors such as Vietnam are actively courting investment dollars. Widodo, who often points to his background as a former furniture exporter to show that he understands the language of business, said he is committed to keeping Indonesia's economy open and competitive. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo gestures during an interview with Reuters in Jakarta, Indonesia, July 3, 2017.BeawihartaWarning Against Protectionism Widodo's government has introduced 15 economic stimulus packages since late 2015, including the easing of foreign ownership restrictions on dozens of business sectors such as tourism, transportation and movie theaters last year. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo stands after an interview with Reuters in Jakarta, Indonesia, July 3, 2017.Beawiharta We will revise again the negative list of investment in August in some sectors,  Widodo said, referring to the list of sectors that are partially or fully closed to foreigners.  He declined to say which sectors would be opened up. Transport Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said last month that the government was considering easing rules on airport operation services. Foreign ownership in that sector is currently capped at 49 percent. Trade openness will be high on Widodo's agenda when he travels to Hamburg, Germany, to meet other world leaders at the G20 summit later this week.           Widodo said he would have a bilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration had put Indonesia on a list of 16 countries to be reviewed over trade surpluses with the world's largest economy.  On international trade, going back to trade protectionism can result in trade war, which we must avoid,  Widodo said.  Open economy is very important for us.

That move, which confirmed a Reuters report, raised concerns among some insiders and customers about a possible power struggle with long-standing airplanes boss Fabrice Bregier, though Airbus denied any tensions.  Cementing changes first outlined last year, the  one Airbus  reorganization involves a single headquarters in Toulouse, France, with Bregier confirmed as group-wide chief operating officer and president of commercial aircraft.  We need to become more integrated, more collaborative and less bureaucratic for speedier decision-making and execution,  Enders said in a letter to employees. The revamp, which saves hundreds of millions of euros in overheads, is designed to complete a decade-long drive to turn the former European consortium - with a history of strong French and German government influence - into a more normal company, and prepare for digital innovations sweeping through industry. But in an unexpected adjustment reported by Reuters on Friday, Airbus said its commercial sales team, best known for contesting leadership of the jet market with Boeing (BA.N), would now report directly to Enders and by-pass Bregier.      That decision is seen as sensitive because it revisits a power-sharing deal between the German Enders and Frenchman Bregier that initially gave the latter responsibility over all planemaking activities. Enders said in his commercial aircraft role, Bregier would lead programs, support and services, engineering, manufacturing, procurement and quality.   However, due to the heavy operational challenges in our largest revenue-driving business, and to slightly rebalance our internal burden-sharing, I will lead sales and marketing,  he said in his letter. The decision sent tremors though the commercial arm and raised questions over the future of Bregier, an industrial and marketing heavyweight whose ties to Enders are seen as key to Airbus's ability to smooth output and face a resurgent Boeing.  People are very surprised. There is no doubt that this is an important step,  a person close to the company said. A jet financier expressed  surprise  at the move, given well-established relations between many airlines and Bregier. Other critics said the sudden move reflected a heavy-handed new management style or risked being perceived as a weakening of French interests.  It is creating a culture in which people will go back to 'Germans versus French' and people having to choose which camp they are in. It is not good for morale or the culture of the company,  said a person with detailed knowledge of the group. An Airbus spokesman called it a routine internal matter of reporting lines, as with any normal company. Political Test The new structure comes almost 10 years to the day after leaders of France and Germany agreed in Toulouse to abolish a system of dual control over the company, with the CEO role shared between two people, one French and one German. Enders had to wait another five years to become sole CEO of the group and another year beyond that to reduce the political influence of French and German government shareholders. Both now own 11 percent but their power is limited under a 2013 overhaul. Analysts say Paris and Berlin have generally had their attention elsewhere during the euro zone crisis but that their hands-off approach remains to be tested against a recently softening market for jets, with thousands of jobs at stake. Airbus also faces a raft of politically charged decisions, such as how long to keep building its slow-selling A380 or its response to corruption probes in Britain, France and Austria. Despite resisting interference, Enders appeared to recognize the significance of French politics to Airbus by writing a letter of support in the familiar 'tu' form to then-presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, which many in Paris saw as a gaffe. Enders is, however, convinced Airbus has to find a new agility to cope with the way 'Big Data' and simultaneous breakthroughs in other technologies are creating opportunities for newcomers such as U.S. rocket maker SpaceX. He acknowledged the new reorganization, which unions say could affect over 1,000 jobs, would be  uncomfortable  for some. But he told staff Airbus was  waving goodbye to an era in which a return to 'stability' was a realistic aspiration .

Hedge funds and other money managers held short positions in the five major contracts on crude, gasoline and heating oil amounting to 510 million barrels on June 27, according to regulatory and exchange data. Fund managers have added 200 million barrels of extra short positions since the end of May and 377 million barrels since crude prices peaked in the middle of February (tmsnrt.rs/2tIamvF). Hedge funds were even more pessimistic than in January 2016, with more short positions than when oil prices were touching their cyclical lows below $30 per barrel. Overall, fund managers were running net short positions of 20 million barrels in gasoline and 32 million barrels in heating oil on June 27 (tmsnrt.rs/2sEiw3l and tmsnrt.rs/2sEoUHL). Funds still had a net long position of 357 million barrels in crude but it had been cut from 589 million barrels on May 30 and a record 951 million barrels on Feb. 21 (tmsnrt.rs/2uhe8Ju). Growing doubts about the effectiveness of OPEC’s production cuts, coupled with increases in crude output from Libya, Nigeria, Canada and the United States have prompted a wave of short-selling. And concerns about the health of gasoline demand and high level inventories in the United States have added to the bearishness within the hedge fund community. Fund managers have ramped up short positions in NYMEX WTI by 86 million barrels over the last four weeks, in the most aggressive short-selling cycle since the start of 2015 (tmsnrt.rs/2t8NQuy). But the sheer number of short sales left the market looking imbalanced and vulnerable to a short-covering rally (“Hedge funds hold near-record short positions in petroleum”, Reuters, June 27). Crude prices have now risen for seven consecutive trading sessions as the pace of short sales slows and some hedge fund managers have been emboldened to start adding long positions in anticipation of a rally. Hedge funds quietly added 3 million barrels of extra long positions in gasoline, 0.7 million in heating oil and 9 million in WTI in the week to June 27 (though this was offset by a continued reduction of 20 million in Brent). Fund managers are likely to have closed out at least some of their short positions as prices have risen consistently over the last week. The U.S. oil rig count fell slightly last week for the first time since early January which accelerated the short covering and provided a boost to oil prices at the end of the week. The critical question for the market is how many of those short positions have been closed out and how many more are still open. If many of the extra short positions have been closed, prices are likely to stabilize around current levels, but if most remain open, upward pressure is likely to continue.

But such an arrangement would fly in the face of Toshiba's assertions that its South Korean rival will have no equity or management influence in the $18 billion chip unit - a stance it has taken to satisfy a government that wants the business to remain under domestic control and for key technology to be kept out of the hands of foreign rivals. The potential for SK Hynix to hold equity would also only harden already trenchant opposition from Western Digital (WDC.O), Toshiba's chip business partner, which is claiming breach of contract and seeking to an injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent. The South Korean chipmaker is part of a Japan government-led consortium that also includes Bain Capital and which was hastily cobbled together last month by Japan's trade ministry. While it has the government's implicit stamp of approval, the unusual structure of the offer has raised questions over whether can feasibly clinch a deal.  New details coming out through the media such as the convertible bonds suggest there may be some flaws in the scheme. Toshiba must now explain its exact structure,  said Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.  Reaching a deal is now looking difficult,  he added.  Sources familiar with the matter have said a state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), would hold the biggest equity interest despite putting up only 300 billion yen ($2.7 billion) of the planned 2 trillion yen. Bain plans to put up 850 billion yen - half of that amount to be provided by SK Hynix in the form of financing, the sources have said.    The South Korean chipmaker plans to buy convertible debt in a special purpose company being created by Bain for the Toshiba acquisition, said one of the sources who spoke on Monday, adding that terms were still being negotiated. SK Hynix was unlikely to convert the debt into equity in the near term, the source said.  SK Hynix declined to comment while representatives for Bain could not be immediately reached for comment. A Toshiba spokesman said the company cannot comment on the specifics of the deal. The sources declined to be identified as the talks were confidential. Toshiba is scrambling to get a deal done as fast as possible as it needs funds to cover billions in cost overruns at now-bankrupt unit Westinghouse. But last week, the Japanese conglomerate missed a self-imposed deadline of having a signed agreement for the chip business in hand, saying more time was needed to smooth out opinions between members of the preferred bidder consortium. Officials within Toshiba's board and INCJ are also concerned about the potential for technology leaks and are demanding the final contract specify that the South Korean firm's financing will never be translated into equity, separate sources have said. SK Hynix has only briefly explained its rationale for being part of the consortium, saying that it sees further business opportunities with Toshiba. It is relatively weak in NAND memory chips although it is the world's No. 2 maker of DRAM chips, which help electronic devices multitask. Toshiba said separately it had made a filing outlining its arguments to Western Digital's request for a preliminary injunction to block the sale of the chip business sale. A hearing on the issue is scheduled for July 14 and Western Digital has said it believes a decision will come on the same day.

The rapid growth in the world's asset management sector since the financial crisis to $75 trillion assets by 2015, or 40 percent of the world's financial assets, has been a largely positive development, Carney told reporters. An issue of concern, however is around  open ended  funds supplying a substantial proportion of cross border flows into developing economies, Carney said. Open-ended refers to a type of fund that can issue and redeem shares at any time. Related CoverageFSB's Carney warns G20 growth at risk from reform fatigueCarney said the concern comes at a time when liquidity, or the ability to sell at short notice to redeem investors, appears better than it is likely to be under stressed conditions.  The question is what will the consequences be when inevitably there is a period of sharp adjustment, reduced liquidity,  Carney said.  What could the knock-on effects be, first and foremost for the economies, but also for the system as a whole. The best in the asset management industry absolutely gets it, and they try to manage those risks.  Earlier this year, the FSB published a set of measures to address risks from such  structural vulnerabilities  in the asset management sector. The watchdog had initially sought to develop a framework for deeming big asset managers  systemically important  like big banks and thereby requiring tougher capital and other requirements. In the face of opposition from markets regulators and the industry, the work was put on ice while focusing on the sector's activities to develop measures that were published in January. Carney said once these measures have been implemented, the FSB will look at whether any  residual  risks remain in the sector that need addressing, such as by deeming the asset management company to be systemic.  The expectation is that the answer will be 'no',  Carney said.  Reporting by Huw Jones, editing by Carolyn Cohn/Keith Weir","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/g20-funds-carney-idUSL8N1JU2UW"},

Her fragile minority government is under mounting pressure to spend more on a range of fronts. Loosening the purse strings would help both the economy and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. Members of May’s own cabinet are calling for the government to abandon a 1 percent cap on pay hikes for public employees, which is squeezing the disposable incomes of nurses and teachers. Allowing public sector pay to rise at the same rate as the private sector would cost an extra 6.3 billion pounds in 2019-20, rising to 9.2 billion pounds in 2021-22, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates. Nor would this be the only unscheduled call on the public purse. The government has pledged 1 billion pounds extra for Northern Ireland over two years as a quid pro quo for securing the support of the province's biggest Protestant party. Planned cuts of 3 billion pounds in funding for local authorities may be revisited after the deadly fire in a London tower block. Meanwhile, slower-than-expected growth will depress tax receipts. Too much is in flux at this stage for private economists to form an accurate picture of the slippage in the budget. But most agree that Finance Minister Philip Hammond is increasingly likely to miss his goal of turning a budget deficit that was worth 46.6 billion pounds, or 2.4 percent of GDP, in the last financial year into a surplus by the mid-2020s. That’s especially true as the government is unlikely to have much appetite for unpopular tax hikes. That’s not great news for the UK gilt market, since bond prices typically fall when governments borrow more. But it could give the Bank of England an opportunity to raise rates to rein in inflation and curb consumer borrowing, which has been growing at double-digit rates. For seven years, Britain has combined tight controls on spending with loose monetary policy. Changing the mix now makes sense. Conveniently, self-interest may force politicians to do the right thing.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

European Central Bank President Mario Draghi renewed his long-standing wish last week for more talks between global central banks, fuelling suspicions that policymakers discussed more at recent gatherings than they admit. Indeed, the ECB, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and Norway's central bank all turned unexpectedly hawkish in just a matter of days with Sweden and the Reserve Bank of Australia expected to follow suit this week. Coming on the heels of the Bank for International Settlement's annual meeting in Switzerland, where top officials are well shielded from the media, traders and analysts have looked suspiciously at the turn of events. However, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic said they often share their economic views in private but to foster understanding and not to coordinate policy as each central bank acts independently.  Banks need to fulfill different mandates with widely different tools and any hint that domestic policy is subjugated to the interest of foreign central banks risks a public relations disaster. This makes policy coordination, let alone cooperation, practically impossible, sources said.   Can you imagine Draghi coming to the Governing Council, or just the board saying: thanks for coming but I've already agreed with Yellen,  a source at a euro zone central bank said.  How quickly would that leak?  While central banks make their own decisions, these still have far reaching consequences for currency, bond and derivatives prices. Therefore policy transparency, the key benefit of private meetings, prepares policymakers for what may be coming, limiting market volatility.   The more we can talk to each other and also communicate to markets in a way that doesn't increase uncertainty, that would be very helpful,  Draghi said last week in Sintra, Portugal, at another gathering of central bankers.  So the need is there, how to do it is not simple.  Some market players seized on that as a new openness by Draghi to coordinate policy with other central banks. Indeed, such cooperation is not unknown. In late 2008, as the global financial crisis was spiraling out of control, banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the ECB and the Swiss National Bank, cut rates in a coordinated move. In 2011, a concerted effort by G7 central banks helped stabilize the Japanese yen after a devastating earthquake. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen looks at her watch after G-20 family photo during the IMF/World Bank spring meetings in Washington, U.S., April 21, 2017.Yuri GripasIn fact, Draghi's remarks in Sintra only echo a call he made a year ago for more dialogue to limit the market volatility related to the varying pace of the recovery across major economies. Picking Up Speed A source familiar with the Fed's thinking also poured cold water on the idea of a pact. Given heightened scrutiny from Congress, any suggestion that the central bank subjugates policy to secret deals with overseas banks would seriously damage the institution's standing, the source added.  We can't reveal any information that is not already in the public domain so we explain our thinking, share our analysis, but can't discuss our next step,  the source said.  Flags fly over the Federal Reserve Headquarters on a windy day in Washington, U.S., May 26, 2017.Kevin LamarquePrivate meetings are often more technical and more detailed given that they are made to an expert audience and they allow for frank discussion that may not be appropriate in public, the sources added.  But I've never heard Yellen or Carney discuss anything that has not already been said in one form or another before,  said a European official, who has attended such closed door meetings in the past.  Yet the shift in the banks' tone is no coincidence, the officials say. The recovery is picking up speed and seems to be solidifying, a conclusion made in various financial centers. And taking a more upbeat stance in public becomes easier when others are also changing their tone, as the risk of a market volatility diminishes, the sources said. But the differences between how central banks operate are also huge. The Fed has to reconcile an inflation and employment mandate while the ECB needs to worry about a discordant currency union that came to the brink of collapse in recent years. And while the Bank of Japan is also seeing some progress, policymakers are keen to say that they are far from tightening policy.     I'm 99 percent sure that no such pact has been agreed – but there is indeed broad common agreement that the world (ex-UK) is looking a whole lot better than they thought just six months ago,  UniCredit economist Erik Nielsen said.   And in such an environment, it is not surprising that central banks are looking to modify their policies,  he added.

In a notice to commercial lenders, the regulator said the dollar auction would be both for spot and forward transactions which would be settled within the next 60 days. The central bank has been intervening on the official market in the last few months in an attempt to narrow the spread between rates on the official market and black market. It has sold more than $5 billion since February. Central bank deputy governor Joseph Nnanna said the relative stability in the foreign exchange market was as a result of the increase in the OPEC member country's oil output and the bank's forex policy. Nigeria has at least six different exchange rates including a retail rate set by licensed exchange bureaus, the official and black market rates and a window for investors where the naira can be traded at rates set freely between buyers and sellers. Nnanna sought the retention of the forex policy and its multiple windows to ensure stability in the market in his presentation at the meeting of the bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting to set interest rates in May.  In my opinion the current exchange rate policy regime including all the access windows to foreign exchange should be retained,  He noted in his statement at the MPC meeting, details of which were published at the weekend. Nigeria is battling a currency crisis brought on by low oil prices, which has tipped Africa's biggest economy into recession and created chronic dollar shortages. Nigerian authorities want to attract foreign investors and at the same time maintain a strong currency to ward off inflation. The naira was quoted flat at 368 on the black market on Monday and quoted by commercial lenders at the interbank window at 306.40 per dollar. The local currency was quoted at 366.41 on the investors' window on Friday.

But they made no direct reference to Rome's appeal for European Union nations to ease the pressure by allowing rescue boats carrying migrants to dock in their ports. Italy, Germany, and France's interior ministers, as well as the EU's migration commissioner, met in Paris on Sunday ahead of an EU ministerial meeting in Tallinn on Thursday.  The European Commission said it would present a set of measures  for reducing flows  of migrants across the central Mediterranean after a meeting of its leadership on Tuesday. These would then be discussed at Thursday's talks in Tallinn. In a joint statement on the Paris meeting that was thin on details, the ministers also agreed to draw up a code of conduct for non-government organizations operating in the Mediterranean, to increase assistance for the International Organisation for Migration, and to lend greater support to a review of how to strengthen Libya's southern borders. FILE PHOTO: Migrants wait to be rescued by  Save the Children  NGO crew in the Mediterranean sea off Libya coast, June 18, 2017.Stefano Rellandini/File Photo We are asking for the work to be shared,  Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said at a U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization conference in Rome shortly before the statement was released.  This is necessary if ... we are to avoid the situation in Italy becoming unsustainable and stoking hostility in a society which until now has responded in an exemplary way, with cohesion.  Italy has taken in about 82,000 refugees and migrants so far this year, a third more than a year ago. That makes Italy the main point of entry to Europe, a fact that is increasingly influencing domestic politics. Voters dealt a blow to the ruling party in local elections last month, opting for right-wing groups promising a tougher line on immigration. A Commission spokeswoman declined comment when asked whether the measures to be proposed might include having NGO boats land asylum-seekers in other countries, notably France and Spain, rather than Italy. Rome has threatened to close its ports and won Commission backing for its called for regional cooperation. However, France and Spain have made no offer as yet.

Model 3 sedan passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule, Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted late on Sunday.  The announcement allayed worries about Tesla's ability to meet its production goals as earlier launches of its Model S sedan and Model X sports utility vehicle were plagued by delays and initial quality issues.  Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be 100 cars and Sept above 1500,  Musk tweeted. bit.ly/2tBqMWb The Palo Alto, California-based company plans to ramp up  Model 3 production to reach a target 500,000 cars per year in 2018.   Musk also said he expected  to complete SN1 on Friday (July 7).  The term  SN1 , taken to be serial number 1, is the first car off assembly line for sale, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters. Priced at $35,000, Model 3 is a smaller, more affordable version of Tesla's Model S sedan with fewer features. Model S prices start at $69,500 in the United States. Customers who have already ordered Model 3 will start getting deliveries as production ramps up, while deliveries for new reservations will start from mid-2018 or later, according to Tesla website.  A lot rides on the success of Model 3 as the lower-priced car is seen helping turn the cash-losing company into a profitable one. Tesla's shares have surged about 70 percent this year through Friday's close of $361.61, and the company has overtaken General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) in market capitalization.

Failure to reach a deal could escalate the dispute, further hitting investors and regional economies. But even a compromise would be unlikely to patch up divisions between the Gulf’s Arab states. Qatar’s refusal to yield to its neighbours’ ultimatum is hurting the region. The coalition, led by Riyadh and including the United Arab Emirates, has imposed a blockade after accusing the sheikhdom of supporting terrorist groups and being too close to Iran. Extending the deadline for Qatar to comply with demands – which include shutting down the Al Jazeera news network and agreeing to financial inspections – at least gives mediation a chance. Failure could lead to a prolonged economic siege, possible retaliation by Qatar to restrict gas supplies or abandon its currency peg, and an increase in the still-remote threat of military escalation. Regardless of the outcome, though, regional cooperation in the Gulf is on hold. Beyond bonds of religion and the inter-marriage of their royal dynasties, the Arab states involved in the current squabble have been formally bound together since 1981 by the Gulf Cooperation Council. Established in the wake of the Iranian Islamic revolution in 1979, the GCC provided collective security for the six oil-rich monarchies and a platform to develop joint policies on trade, customs tariffs and monetary policy. Since then monetary policy and financial markets have converged in the region, which had a combined output of $1.6 trillion in 2016. The current rift probably spells the end of some key economic policies and reforms. Plans to generate new sources of government revenue, including a value-added tax at a standard rate of 5 percent across the bloc, could now be shelved. Other key pillars such as the free movement of residents, trade and capital across the GCC are also in doubt, as is a more ambitious plan to create a currency union. The lack of reform will make it even harder for the GCC states to diversify their oil-dependent economies. Whatever the result of the current dispute, the alliance looks broken.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Her fragile minority government is under mounting pressure to spend more on a range of fronts. Loosening the purse strings would help both the economy and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. Members of May’s own cabinet are calling for the government to abandon a 1 percent cap on pay hikes for public employees, which is squeezing the disposable incomes of nurses and teachers. Allowing public sector pay to rise at the same rate as the private sector would cost an extra 6.3 billion pounds in 2019-20, rising to 9.2 billion pounds in 2021-22, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates. Nor would this be the only unscheduled call on the public purse. The government has pledged 1 billion pounds extra for Northern Ireland over two years as a quid pro quo for securing the support of the province's biggest Protestant party. Planned cuts of 3 billion pounds in funding for local authorities may be revisited after the deadly fire in a London tower block. Meanwhile, slower-than-expected growth will depress tax receipts. Too much is in flux at this stage for private economists to form an accurate picture of the slippage in the budget. But most agree that Finance Minister Philip Hammond is increasingly likely to miss his goal of turning a budget deficit that was worth 46.6 billion pounds, or 2.4 percent of GDP, in the last financial year into a surplus by the mid-2020s. That’s especially true as the government is unlikely to have much appetite for unpopular tax hikes. That’s not great news for the UK gilt market, since bond prices typically fall when governments borrow more. But it could give the Bank of England an opportunity to raise rates to rein in inflation and curb consumer borrowing, which has been growing at double-digit rates. For seven years, Britain has combined tight controls on spending with loose monetary policy. Changing the mix now makes sense. Conveniently, self-interest may force politicians to do the right thing.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

China says the system's powerful radar can probe deep into its territory, undermining its security and a regional balance while doing nothing to stop North Korea in its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them.  The U.S. deployment of an advanced anti-missile system in South Korea gravely harms the strategic security interests of China, Russia and other countries in the region,  China's state Xinhua news agency cited Xi as saying. The United States and South Korea say the THAAD is solely aimed at defending the South from North Korea. China and Russia have maintained close communication and coordination on the issue and held very similar views on it, Xi said in an interview with Russian media. A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptor is seen in Seongju, South Korea, June 13, 2017. Picture taken on June 13, 2017.Kim Hong-Ji Beijing and Moscow are steadfastly opposed to the THAAD deployment and seriously suggest that relevant countries stop and cancel the installation,  Xinhua cited xi as saying. China and Russia would take  necessary measures , either together or independently, to protect their interests, Xi said, without elaborating, according to Xinhua. Xi also said China and Russia should work together to boost trade and increase investment and financial cooperation, Xinhua reported. Xi will arrive in Moscow for a state visit on Monday before traveling to Germany to attend a G20 summit. Relations between China and South Korea have been strained by the THAAD deployment though both sides have struck a more conciliatory tone since President Moon Jae-in took office in South Korea May.

The FSB coordinates financial regulations for the Group of 20 countries (G20) whose leaders meet in Germany this week. The FSB was formed during the crisis that began in 2007 but after an intensive decade of making rules some policymakers now want to prioritise growth over banking regulation. U.S. President Donald Trump has said regulation is holding back lending and the U.S. Treasury has recommended delaying two measures that strengthen bank funding and require lenders to hold more capital for the securities on their trading books. Carney, who is also the governor of the Bank of England, said in a letter to G20 leaders that there had been  immense progress  since the crisis in making banks safer, but nascent risks remained that needed to be addressed.  In particular, giving into reform fatigue could erode the willingness of G20 members to rely on each other's systems and institutions and, in the process, fragment pools of funding and liquidity,  Carney said. He said that would mean  less and more expensive  financing for households and businesses, and lower economic growth would be  very likely . Working together through reinforced, voluntary international regulatory cooperation based on agreed global rules would help to avoid this, said Carney. Impact Review The FSB has sought to keep members on board by reviewing new regulations and their impact. Carney said the review showed that higher resilience in the financial system has been achieved,  without impeding the supply of credit to the economy . Besides Washington's misgivings about some reforms, regulators on the Basel Committee are also facing difficulties completing Basel III, a set of tougher capital rules for lenders worldwide. France has said Basel III rules, still to be implemented, would force European lenders to find large amounts of extra capital but Carney called on G20 leaders to urgently help the Committee finish the job. Carney also said that so-called shadow banking - the sector that provides credit outside the banking system - was initially seen as risky and too lightly regulated but it had now been transformed into  resilient market-based finance . The central banker said once the rules already agreed for shadow banking had been fully implemented there would no need for any more to address existing risks - a conclusion the sector is likely to welcome. The FSB will also convene a high-level roundtable to review whether there were unwarranted barriers that prevent remittance providers from accessing banking services. There has been a decline in correspondent banking as global banks withdraw payments services from rivals in countries deemed at risk from money laundering or terrorism financing, making it harder for diaspora to send money back to their families. A UK scheme to make managers at banks directly accountable for decisions could also be applied globally in some form to tackle misconduct, Carney said. The so-called senior managers regime was introduced in March last year, though some lenders have been skirting the new rules.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * Graphic of China PMI vs. LME copper: tmsnrt.rs/2sDi5Gi By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 3 (Reuters) - Copper reached a three-month high after a surprise rise in China's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), and while the boost was short-lived it does beg the question as to whether better times are ahead for the industrial metal. Benchmark London copper futures touched $5,965 a tonne on June 30 after the official Chinese PMI rose to 51.7 in June, it's eleventh consecutive month on the positive side of the 50-level that marks expansion from contraction in the world's biggest manufacturing sector. Copper's gains didn't last beyond the Asian session, slipping as the U.S. dollar strengthened and also as London Metal Exchange data showed inventories of the red metal gained, indicating supplies are plentiful. Nonetheless, copper is holding around its strongest levels since March, and is up 8.2 percent since its recent closing low of $5,486 a tonne on May 8. Hedge funds and other money managers also seem to be backing the view that copper's recent rally still has further to run, boosting long positions by 9,531 contracts to 58,816, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data, released on June 30. The net-long copper position is now nearly double the 29,787 contracts reported on May 9, and a dramatic reversal from the net-short position of 47,109 contracts that prevailed a year ago, on June 14, 2016. It's probably no surprise that hedge fund managers have switched from net-short to net-long copper as the Chinese manufacturing sector has improved over the past year. But is this optimism still justified or is copper starting to look a little stretched? In past periods of gains in China's PMI, copper has certainly also rallied, and on one occasion since the 2008 global recession, it continued to rise even after the PMI peaked. The PMI was at 51.2 in June 2010 and rose to 55.2 by November of that year, while London copper rose from around $6,101 a tonne in June to a peak of $10,160 in February 2011. The PMI troughed at 49 in November 2011, before rising to 53.3 by April 2012, while copper bottomed slightly before the PMI, reaching $6,735 a tonne in October 2011, before hitting a top before the PMI, at around $8,760 in February 2012. Since then the PMI trended lower along with copper until the index hit a low of 49 in February 2016, slightly after the bottom for copper in January 2016. While the Chinese PMI is far from the only driver of copper prices, it appears to be a useful indicator. China Challenges Ahead The problem for copper bulls is that it's becoming harder to find analysts that think the PMI is going to extend its recent strong run. Most are bracing for weaker readings in the second half of 2017. This is largely because of the view that keeping China's stimulus spending going is becoming more of a challenge for the authorities in Beijing, especially given concerns over credit quality and a slowdown in the key residential property construction sector. There also appears to be a widening gap between large, mainly state-owned firms and small- to medium-sized private companies. The official PMI captures more of the large corporate sector, which appears to be more resilient to tightening credit conditions than the smaller businesses. The Caixin PMI, which measures more smaller businesses, did rise in June to 50.4, surprising market watchers, who had picked a reading of 49.5 in a Reuters survey of 25 analysts. However, it's worth noting that the Caixin PMI is only just in positive territory and well below the official measure. Another point from the Caixin PMI was confidence among Chinese manufacturers for the next 12 months fell to lowest level this year in June, underscoring the mood of caution that currently prevails. While the PMIs may on the surface be producing positive signs for copper, the detail shows the outlook is not as bullish as the rise in net-long positions may suggest. China's copper imports are also not looking that great for prices as well, with refined metal imports down 28.2 percent in the first five months of the year. Chinese buyers appear to be switching to scrap copper, with imports rising 17.6 percent in the first five months, a shift that is hardly going to boost the price of London futures. It's worth noting that scrap imports in the January to May period were 1.51 million tonnes, while refined imports were 1.27 million tonnes, a reversal from 2016, when refined metal imports were 3.7 percent higher than those of scrap. Putting the import data together with the two Chinese PMIs and the case for being cautious about the copper price outlook for the next few months seems to be more convincing than placing a bullish bet.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a market analyst for Reuters.) * Funds, Chicago wheat: reut.rs/2sZTGhz * Funds, K.C. wheat: reut.rs/2u7RyTH * Funds, Minneapolis wheat: reut.rs/2sZTBuA * Funds, corn: reut.rs/2svj2kf * Funds, soybeans: reut.rs/2t01Jv9 * Funds, soybean meal: reut.rs/2svCWeR * Funds, soybean oil: reut.rs/2u7FF09 By Karen Braun CHICAGO, July 3 (Reuters) - Funds have nearly washed away their bearish Chicago wheat bets and are likely entering July as bulls. If true, this would mark specs’ first net long in the soft red wheat market in nearly two years. In the week ended June 27, hedge funds and other money managers cut their net short in CBOT wheat futures and options to 10,158 contracts from 20,971 in the week prior, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (reut.rs/2sZTGhz). Profit-taking following the previous week’s massive round of short covering prevented speculators from further trimming the Chicago wheat position early in the week, but explosiveness in Minneapolis spring wheat futures on June 27 pulled other wheat contracts up with it, and they have been on their way up ever since. In K.C. wheat futures and options, money managers are ending June on the most bullish note ever. They extended their net long in the week ended June 27 to 44,240 contracts from 37,701 in the previous week, and the new stance is funds’ most bullish on the hard red wheat since April 1, 2014 (reut.rs/2u7RyTH). Funds also upped bullish bets in Minneapolis spring wheat futures and options, increasing their net long to 15,347 contracts from 12,720 in the week before. (reut.rs/2sZTBuA) Speculators went the other way on CBOT corn, expanding their net short to 106,119 futures and options contracts from 53,825 in the week prior. They had nearly wiped clean their bearish bets around mid-month over threatening U.S. weather forecasts, but largely benign outlooks ever since have led traders to once again hit the  sell  button. (reut.rs/2svj2kf) Wheat futures have been through the roof in the days since, though, especially Minneapolis, and funds may soon be bulls across all three wheat contracts. Drought continues to plague spring wheat in the Northern U.S. Plains, and lower-than-expected wheat acres in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s acreage report on Friday confirmed wheat’s upward march. Spring wheat acres in particular came in below expectations at a 45-year low and Minneapolis wheat futures have put on nearly $1 (or 13 percent) since June 27. Trade sources suggest that June 30 was the funds’ most active wheat buying day of the year thus far, as most-active CBOT September futures settled up the daily 30-cent limit, and spot CBOT wheat traded above $5 a bushel for the first time in a year. CBOT corn also followed wheat up on Friday, though gains were more modest under generally bearish stocks and acres from USDA. But uncertainties over conditions and weather still exist, and the weather outlook going into Monday will largely dictate the near-term direction of the corn market. Record Shorts in Soy, Meal Speculators reached new levels of bearishness in CBOT soybeans and soybean meal in the week ended June 27, completely dwarfing their extension of bullishness in soybean oil. But new records are extremely unlikely next week. Money managers expanded their net short in soybean futures and options to 118,683 contracts from 87,140 in the week prior. This surpasses the week ended May 26, 2015, for the most bearish by specs on the oilseed, and it marks only the second time on record in which the fund short surpassed 100,000 contracts (reut.rs/2t01Jv9). Funds also logged a new all-time net short in soybean meal at 54,430 futures and options contracts, replacing the old record of 50,941 contracts set back on June 6. Soybean meal futures have struggled in recent months amid a general abundance of feed ingredients, and funds have maintained a record bearish stance for the date since mid-May (reut.rs/2svCWeR). Soybean oil retained speculators’ overall optimism last week, as funds increased their modest net long to 10,511 futures and options contracts from 4,769 in the previous week (reut.rs/2u7FF09). The bean oil position prevented the soy complex from overtaking the week ended June 6 as the most bearish combined fund stance of all time. Futures market activity in the days since suggests the record will be safe again for the week ended July 4, and perhaps in the longer term pending U.S. weather forecasts. The bullish soybean stocks figures and lower-than-expected U.S. acres from USDA on Friday sent most-active November futures up 30 cents, and oil and meal followed along. Similar to wheat, June 30 may have been the funds’ most active soybean buying day of 2017. Editing by Matthew Lewis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/cbot-grains-braun-idUSL1N1JR1ZA"},

Wall Street looked set for further gains on Tuesday, with index futures up about 0.3 to 0.4 percent , after the S&P; 500 index had its best first half-year since 2013. The pan-European STOXX 600 index, which suffered its biggest month loss for a year in June on worries over tightening monetary conditions, rose 0.6 percent, led higher by banks and basic resources firms. France's CAC 40 index rose 1 percent, Spain's IBEX 0.9 percent and Italy's FTSE MIB 1.6 percent. Britain's main FTSE 100 index added 0.4 percent. Mining group Glencore rose 2.8 percent to 295 pence a share after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the stock to 320 pence. A number of senior policymakers hinted last week that it may be time to end the era of ultra-loose monetary policy. Banks, which benefit from higher interest rates, were among the leading gainers. An index of Italian banks gained 2.4 percent, helped by a 6-percent rise in Carige on the day its board meets to discuss capital plans for the regional lender. Carige, Italy's ninth-biggest bank with assets of 26 billion euros ($29.7 billion), has been told by the European Central Bank it needs to raise capital and get rid of bad loans. Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan held steady, staying within a stone's throw of a two-year peak hit last week. Japan's Nikkei ticked up 0.1 percent, buoyed by a Bank of Japan survey showing confidence among big manufacturers hit its highest in more than three months in June. Chinese blue-chip shares dipped on worries that the world's second-biggest economy could be slowing down. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.1 percent, with financial shares benefiting from the launch on Monday of the  Bond Connect  scheme linking China's $9 trillion bond market with overseas investors. The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of currencies and fell 1.7 percent last week, gained 0.5 percent as U.S. Treasury yields rose. Ten-year yields hit a high of 2.33 percent and last stood at 2.31 percent, up 1.2 basis points (bps). The euro, which hit 14-month highs against the dollar last week after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinted at tweaks to the bank's bond-buying stimulus programme, fell 0.5 percent to $1.1366. In anticipation of growing economic strength, euro zone manufacturing activity, as measured by IHS Market's purchasing managers' index for June, hit its highest since April 2011. The yen fell 0.6 percent to 113.02 to the dollar after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Liberal Democratic Party lost an election in Tokyo on Sunday. Sterling slipped 0.5 percent to $1.3005 after weaker-than-expected manufacturing sector data. PMI data showed activity fell to 54.3 from a downwardly revised 56.3 in May - a three-month low and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll.  UK manufacturing fell off the cliff and it clearly shows that economy is not doing well at all,  Think Markets analyst Naeem Aslam said. Bund Yields Pull Back German 10-year government bond yields, the benchmark for euro zone borrowing costs, pulled back from 3 1/2-month highs hit in the wake of Draghi's comments. It last stood at 0.45 percent, down 2.4 bps.  The market reaction last week was very sharp and now is probably the time to digest recent comments,  BNP Paribas European rates strategist, Patrick Jacq, said.  July could be a more supportive month for bonds as there is less supply, but clearly the trend is now upwards for yields.  Brent crude oil rose 11 cents to $48.88 a barrel after a survey on Friday showed U.S. drillers cut the number of rigs in use by two to 756 last week. The total was still more than double the number a year ago. Gains were limited, however, as a Reuters survey on Friday showed OPEC oil output rose by 280,000 barrels a day to a 2017 high, despite the group having agreed to cut production to help balance the market.

Pluralism has always been a part of Indonesia's DNA,  Joko Widodo told Reuters in an interview at the presidential palace in Jakarta.  Despite many challenges, Islam in Indonesia has always been a force for moderation.  Indonesia's state ideology includes national unity, social justice and democracy alongside belief in God, and enshrines religious diversity in a secular system of government. Hardline Islamist groups were banned under the authoritarian regime of President Suharto, which ended in 1998, but they have gained ground in recent years, emerging from the fringes of society in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country. Religious and political tensions spiraled at the end of last year when Islamists led protests by hundreds of thousands in Jakarta against the capital's then governor, an ethnic-Chinese Christian who was charged with insulting the Koran. Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ally of President Widodo, lost his bid for re-election to a Muslim rival in April after months of agitation against him by a radical group, the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI).  In May he was sentenced to two years in jail for blasphemy. Widodo said Indonesia was  still a model  of pluralism and noted comments on Saturday by former U.S. President Barack Obama - on a personal visit to the country where he spent some of his childhood - that its history of tolerance must be preserved.  It is very important here in Indonesia, the United States, Europe, everywhere, to fight against the politics of 'us and them',  Obama told a conference in Jakarta. Careful Line on Homosexuality The targets of hardline Islamic groups have included the  lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, many of whom have been driven underground by police raids. With the exception of the ultra-conservative Aceh province,   where Islamic law is enforced and two men were publicly flogged in May for gay sex, homosexuality is legal in Indonesia. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo gestures during an interview with Reuters in Jakarta, Indonesia, July 3, 2017.BeawihartaBut Widodo's own defense minister has branded homosexuality  a national security threat and last week a leader of Indonesia's  second-largest Muslim group called for a boycott of Starbucks because of the international coffee chain's pro-gay stand. The president trod a careful line on the question of LGBT rights, saying that  Indonesia remains a tolerant nation  whose constitution guarantees that everyone's rights are respected and protected. But he added:  We are the largest majority Muslim country so Indonesia has its own religious norms, unique values and also cultures that must be respected.  Isis Has No Place in Indonesia Slideshow (4 Images)The muscle-flexing of hardline groups has fed fears that Indonesia will become fertile ground for Islamist militants. Widodo said he would press parliament to move more quickly on passing a new anti-terrorism law that would make it easier to both arrest and detain suspects.  We need this law,  he said, hammering his finger on the table in front of him. The attempt in May by a small army of Islamic State-allied fighters to overrun a city in the southern Philippines has been widely seen as a bid by the ultra-radical group, on a backfoot in Syria and Iraq, to establish a stronghold in Southeast Asia. Philippines officials have said there were Indonesians and Malaysians among the fighters who attacked Marawi City, where a battle with government troops has ground on for six weeks.  ISIS has no place in Indonesia,  Widodo said, using a popular acronym for Islamic State. He noted that Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines had agreed to joint maritime patrols to prevent militants moving across their islands, and said he discussed cooperation on a phone call with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte last week.  Our security and intelligence agencies continue to work hard to combat this threat. We are also continuing to promote the values of moderate Islam and when I talked with President Duterte last week I said that 'your problem is my problem'.

European Central Bank President Mario Draghi renewed his long-standing wish last week for more talks between global central banks, fuelling suspicions that policymakers discussed more at recent gatherings than they admit. Indeed, the ECB, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and Norway's central bank all turned unexpectedly hawkish in just a matter of days with Sweden and the Reserve Bank of Australia expected to follow suit this week. Coming on the heels of the Bank for International Settlement's annual meeting in Switzerland, where top officials are well shielded from the media, traders and analysts have looked suspiciously at the turn of events. However, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic said they often share their economic views in private but to foster understanding and not to coordinate policy as each central bank acts independently.  Banks need to fulfill different mandates with widely different tools and any hint that domestic policy is subjugated to the interest of foreign central banks risks a public relations disaster. This makes policy coordination, let alone cooperation, practically impossible, sources said.   Can you imagine Draghi coming to the Governing Council, or just the board saying: thanks for coming but I've already agreed with Yellen,  a source at a euro zone central bank said.  How quickly would that leak?  While central banks make their own decisions, these still have far reaching consequences for currency, bond and derivatives prices. Therefore policy transparency, the key benefit of private meetings, prepares policymakers for what may be coming, limiting market volatility.   The more we can talk to each other and also communicate to markets in a way that doesn't increase uncertainty, that would be very helpful,  Draghi said last week in Sintra, Portugal, at another gathering of central bankers.  So the need is there, how to do it is not simple.  Some market players seized on that as a new openness by Draghi to coordinate policy with other central banks. Indeed, such cooperation is not unknown. In late 2008, as the global financial crisis was spiraling out of control, banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the ECB and the Swiss National Bank, cut rates in a coordinated move. In 2011, a concerted effort by G7 central banks helped stabilize the Japanese yen after a devastating earthquake. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen looks at her watch after G-20 family photo during the IMF/World Bank spring meetings in Washington, U.S., April 21, 2017.Yuri GripasIn fact, Draghi's remarks in Sintra only echo a call he made a year ago for more dialogue to limit the market volatility related to the varying pace of the recovery across major economies. Picking Up Speed A source familiar with the Fed's thinking also poured cold water on the idea of a pact. Given heightened scrutiny from Congress, any suggestion that the central bank subjugates policy to secret deals with overseas banks would seriously damage the institution's standing, the source added.  We can't reveal any information that is not already in the public domain so we explain our thinking, share our analysis, but can't discuss our next step,  the source said.  Flags fly over the Federal Reserve Headquarters on a windy day in Washington, U.S., May 26, 2017.Kevin LamarquePrivate meetings are often more technical and more detailed given that they are made to an expert audience and they allow for frank discussion that may not be appropriate in public, the sources added.  But I've never heard Yellen or Carney discuss anything that has not already been said in one form or another before,  said a European official, who has attended such closed door meetings in the past.  Yet the shift in the banks' tone is no coincidence, the officials say. The recovery is picking up speed and seems to be solidifying, a conclusion made in various financial centers. And taking a more upbeat stance in public becomes easier when others are also changing their tone, as the risk of a market volatility diminishes, the sources said. But the differences between how central banks operate are also huge. The Fed has to reconcile an inflation and employment mandate while the ECB needs to worry about a discordant currency union that came to the brink of collapse in recent years. And while the Bank of Japan is also seeing some progress, policymakers are keen to say that they are far from tightening policy.     I'm 99 percent sure that no such pact has been agreed – but there is indeed broad common agreement that the world (ex-UK) is looking a whole lot better than they thought just six months ago,  UniCredit economist Erik Nielsen said.   And in such an environment, it is not surprising that central banks are looking to modify their policies,  he added.

The Nordic country wants to open up new areas for exploration in the north of the country to offset declining oil production in the south. Oil production is Norway's leading industry, accounting for 20 percent of its economy. A key part of the drive is to open up a border zone between Russia and Norway to oil firms, called the Barents Sea South East, after a 2010 deal that ended four decades of disagreement over the border. A report commissioned by environmentalist groups Greenpeace and Nature and Youth, which oppose oil activity in the Arctic, said drilling in the zone would not bring as many economic benefits as the Norwegian government expects it would. The report by Mads Greaker, a senior researcher at the Norwegian statistics agency, and Knut Einar Rosendahl, a professor at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, criticized an assessment made by the government in 2012-2013. Among its criticisms, it said the government assessment was based on an oil price of $120 per barrel against $48 on Monday.  If we assume more reasonable price expectations, consider costs CO2 emissions in Norway, as well as discount future revenues and expense, the net benefit falls from 280 billion crowns ($33.37 billion) - high scenario - and 50 billion crowns  - low scenario - to 41 billion crowns and a loss of 2 billion respectively,  said the report.   These are significant changes,  it said. Greenpeace and Nature and Youth are suing the Norwegian government over its latest oil licensing round, accusing it of infringing the Norwegian constitution by not protecting nature for future generations. The court case starts in November. Norway's Oil and Energy Ministry declined to comment on the report, citing the upcoming court case and the inclusion of the report in the evidence to be submitted to the court. On June 21, the state offered a record number of blocks in the Arctic Barents Sea.

The USS Stethem, a guided-missile destroyer, sailed within 12 nautical miles of Triton Island, part of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea, the official said. The operation was first reported by Fox News on Sunday. It was the second  freedom-of-navigation operation,  or  fonop,  conducted during the presidency of Donald Trump, following a drill in late May in which a U.S. warship sailed within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built up by China in the South China Sea. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement the U.S. ship had made an unauthorized entry into China's territorial waters. The operation was a  serious political and military provocation,  said the statement, issued late on Sunday, citing ministry spokesman Lu Kang. It said China had sent battle ships and fighter jets to warn off the Stethem.  China strongly urges the U.S. side to immediately stop this kind of provocative action which seriously violates China's sovereignty and puts at risk China's security,  Lu said. China would take all necessary measures to defend itself, he said. China's Defence Ministry said in a social media post on Monday the U.S. action had seriously damaged peace and stability in the South China Sea and reiterated its resolute opposition to the warship's entry.  The U.S. conduct seriously damages strategic trust between the two sides and seriously damages the political atmosphere of the development of China-U.S. military relations,  the ministry said, without elaborating.

Sailing within those 12 miles is meant to show that the United States does not recognize territorial claims there.  Unlike in the Spratlys, where China has created new artificial territory in the last several years, it has effectively controlled the Paracels since 1974,  said Mira Rapp-Hooper, a South China Sea expert at the Center for a New American Security.  It claims illegal straight baselines around the Paracels, and the fonop may have been contesting these.  The Paracels are also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam. China fully occupied the Paracels in 1974 after forcing the navy of the-then South Vietnam off its holdings. Trump has heaped praise on Chinese President Xi Jinping, but his administration has also stepped up pressure on Beijing as he has become frustrated that China has not done more to pressure North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. On Thursday, the administration imposed sanctions on two Chinese citizens and a shipping company for helping North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, and accused a Chinese bank of laundering money for Pyongyang.  The Trump administration has also approved an arms package for Taiwan worth about $1.4 billion, the State Department said last week. China deems Taiwan its own and has never renounced the use of force to bring the self-ruled island under its control. Trump spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday, ahead of meetings he will hold with both leaders on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, next Friday and Saturday.

Pluralism has always been a part of Indonesia's DNA,  Joko Widodo told Reuters in an interview at the presidential palace in Jakarta.  Despite many challenges, Islam in Indonesia has always been a force for moderation.  Indonesia's state ideology includes national unity, social justice and democracy alongside belief in God, and enshrines religious diversity in a secular system of government. Hardline Islamist groups were banned under the authoritarian regime of President Suharto, which ended in 1998, but they have gained ground in recent years, emerging from the fringes of society in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country. Religious and political tensions spiraled at the end of last year when Islamists led protests by hundreds of thousands in Jakarta against the capital's then governor, an ethnic-Chinese Christian who was charged with insulting the Koran. Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ally of President Widodo, lost his bid for re-election to a Muslim rival in April after months of agitation against him by a radical group, the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI).  In May he was sentenced to two years in jail for blasphemy. Widodo said Indonesia was  still a model  of pluralism and noted comments on Saturday by former U.S. President Barack Obama - on a personal visit to the country where he spent some of his childhood - that its history of tolerance must be preserved.  It is very important here in Indonesia, the United States, Europe, everywhere, to fight against the politics of 'us and them',  Obama told a conference in Jakarta. Careful Line on Homosexuality The targets of hardline Islamic groups have included the  lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, many of whom have been driven underground by police raids. With the exception of the ultra-conservative Aceh province,   where Islamic law is enforced and two men were publicly flogged in May for gay sex, homosexuality is legal in Indonesia. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo gestures during an interview with Reuters in Jakarta, Indonesia, July 3, 2017.BeawihartaBut Widodo's own defense minister has branded homosexuality  a national security threat and last week a leader of Indonesia's  second-largest Muslim group called for a boycott of Starbucks because of the international coffee chain's pro-gay stand. The president trod a careful line on the question of LGBT rights, saying that  Indonesia remains a tolerant nation  whose constitution guarantees that everyone's rights are respected and protected. But he added:  We are the largest majority Muslim country so Indonesia has its own religious norms, unique values and also cultures that must be respected.  Isis Has No Place in Indonesia Slideshow (4 Images)The muscle-flexing of hardline groups has fed fears that Indonesia will become fertile ground for Islamist militants. Widodo said he would press parliament to move more quickly on passing a new anti-terrorism law that would make it easier to both arrest and detain suspects.  We need this law,  he said, hammering his finger on the table in front of him. The attempt in May by a small army of Islamic State-allied fighters to overrun a city in the southern Philippines has been widely seen as a bid by the ultra-radical group, on a backfoot in Syria and Iraq, to establish a stronghold in Southeast Asia. Philippines officials have said there were Indonesians and Malaysians among the fighters who attacked Marawi City, where a battle with government troops has ground on for six weeks.  ISIS has no place in Indonesia,  Widodo said, using a popular acronym for Islamic State. He noted that Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines had agreed to joint maritime patrols to prevent militants moving across their islands, and said he discussed cooperation on a phone call with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte last week.  Our security and intelligence agencies continue to work hard to combat this threat. We are also continuing to promote the values of moderate Islam and when I talked with President Duterte last week I said that 'your problem is my problem'.

The Nordic country wants to open up new areas for exploration in the north of the country to offset declining oil production in the south. Oil production is Norway's leading industry, accounting for 20 percent of its economy. A key part of the drive is to open up a border zone between Russia and Norway to oil firms, called the Barents Sea South East, after a 2010 deal that ended four decades of disagreement over the border. A report commissioned by environmentalist groups Greenpeace and Nature and Youth, which oppose oil activity in the Arctic, said drilling in the zone would not bring as many economic benefits as the Norwegian government expects it would. The report by Mads Greaker, a senior researcher at the Norwegian statistics agency, and Knut Einar Rosendahl, a professor at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, criticized an assessment made by the government in 2012-2013. Among its criticisms, it said the government assessment was based on an oil price of $120 per barrel against $48 on Monday.  If we assume more reasonable price expectations, consider costs CO2 emissions in Norway, as well as discount future revenues and expense, the net benefit falls from 280 billion crowns ($33.37 billion) - high scenario - and 50 billion crowns  - low scenario - to 41 billion crowns and a loss of 2 billion respectively,  said the report.   These are significant changes,  it said. Greenpeace and Nature and Youth are suing the Norwegian government over its latest oil licensing round, accusing it of infringing the Norwegian constitution by not protecting nature for future generations. The court case starts in November. Norway's Oil and Energy Ministry declined to comment on the report, citing the upcoming court case and the inclusion of the report in the evidence to be submitted to the court. On June 21, the state offered a record number of blocks in the Arctic Barents Sea.

Industry groups said the exodus was already hitting some companies, which depend on migrants from Thailand's poorer neighbors for manual labor for everything from construction to the multi-billion dollar seafood industry.  The private sector is in shock,  said Tanit Sorat, vice chairman of Employers' Confederation of Thailand.  These are jobs that Thais will not do so if there is a labor shortage businesses cannot move forward.  Thailand has more than 3 million migrant workers, the International Organization for Migration says, but rights groups put the figure higher.  Since taking power in a 2014 coup, Thailand's ruling junta has had varying degrees of success in campaigns to regulate the foreign workforce, spurred partly by media reports that unregulated workers faced exploitation by employers. About 60,000 workers left between June 23 and June 28, and the number has risen since, an Immigration Bureau official said.  They were of all nationalities, but the biggest group was from Myanmar,  Deputy Commissioner Pornchai Kuntee told Reuters.  They are probably very scared.  Following news of the exodus, Thailand on Friday promised a 120-day delay in enforcing parts of the decree, including fines that can range up to 800,000 baht ($23,557) for employers who hire unregistered foreign workers without permits. Geta Devi, 28, a worker from Myanmar based in Bangkok, said some of her friends panicked over the decree and headed home. Thai government trucks have been taking workers to the Myanmar town of Myawaddy, 246 km (153 miles) east of Yangon, and opposite the Thai town of Mae Sot, a Myanmar official said. It was unclear if they were leaving Thailand voluntarily. More than 16,000 people, including both legal and undocumented migrants had returned since June 29, said Aung Htay Win, a labor ministry official who is coordinating Myanmar's response. Returning workers were being temporarily housed in government buildings.  Most of them stay for one night or so, then they continue to their home towns,  he said,  Labourers work at a construction site in downtown Bangkok, Thailand July 3, 2017.Chaiwat SubprasomUp to 500 migrant workers had returned to Cambodia since last week, authorities there said. Business Hit In Bangkok, an executive at a construction company said as many as 80 percent of workers had gone from some of its building sites. Fishing groups also voiced concern, saying foreign workers were essential for nearly 30,000 boats.  If foreign labor disappears, these boats will remain docked,  said Mongkol Sukjareonkhana, chairman of the Thailand Fishery Cooperative. But Thai Union, the world's biggest canned tuna company, told Reuters it expected no impact because all its migrant workers were legal.  Agribusiness giant Charoen Pokphand Foods also said none of its workers had gone home. There was little change on Monday in the prices of their shares or those of Thailand's three biggest listed building firms: CH Karnchang, Sino Thai Engineering and Italian Thai Development. Mass movement leaves undocumented workers vulnerable, said Andy Hall, a migrant workers' rights expert who has monitored migration in Thailand for more than a decade. Despite a police threat of punishment for anyone trying to extort money from migrants or employers,  corrupt officials  would try to seek bribes, he told Reuters.  Mass profit is to be made in a short time from the panic and commotion,  Hall said. Last month, the United States kept Thailand on a trafficking watch list, saying it fell short of the minimum standards to end human trafficking.

On the surface, the Tokyo Metropolitan assembly election was a referendum on Governor Yuriko Koike's year in office, but the dismal showing for Abe's party is also a stinging rebuke of his 4-1/2-year-old administration. Koike's Tokyo Citizens First party and its allies took 79 seats in the 127-seat assembly. The LDP won a mere 23, its worst-ever results, compared with 57 before the election.  We must recognize this as an historic defeat,  former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba was quoted as saying by NHK.  Rather than a victory for Tokyo Citizens First, this is a defeat for the LDP,  said Ishiba, who is widely seen as an Abe rival within the ruling party. Past Tokyo elections have been bellwethers for national trends. A 2009 Tokyo poll in which the LDP won just 38 seats was followed by its defeat in a general election that year, although this time no lower house poll need be held until late 2018. Related CoverageJapan PM seeks to regain public's trust after Tokyo poll setbackKoike, a media-savvy ex-defense minister and former LDP member, took office a year ago as the first female governor in the capital, defying the local LDP chapter to run and promising to reform governance of a megacity with a population of 13.7 million and an economy bigger than the Netherlands'. Among her allies in the Komeito party, the LDP's national coalition partner, got 23 seats.  I am excited but at the same time, I am also keenly aware of the weight of my responsibility,  Koike told NHK, adding the results had exceeded her expectations. Speculation, Coalition Cracks, Rivals Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe speaks to reporter as he arrives at his office in Tokyo, Japan, July 3, 2017.Kim Kyung-HoonThe strong showing by Koike's party will fuel speculation that she will make a bid for the nation's top job, although that may not be until after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. It could also widen cracks between the LDP and the Komeito while damaging prospects for the opposition Democratic Party, which won five seats.  Abe's rivals in his party could be encouraged by the LDP's dismal performance to challenge him in a leadership race in September 2018, victory in which would set Abe on course to become Japan's longest-serving leader and bolster his hopes of revising the post-war, pacifist constitution. Slideshow (2 Images)The LDP's thrashing, however, could make it harder for Abe to pursue his cherished goal of revising the U.S.-drafted constitution's pacifist Article 9 by 2020, a politically divisive agenda, said Sophia University professor Koichi Nakano.  His prime motive to stay in power is his desire to revise the constitution, but once his popularity really starts to fall, that becomes very difficult to do,  Nakano said.  Abe's troubles center on concern he may have intervened to help Kake Gakuen (Kake Educational Institution) win approval for a veterinary school in a special economic zone. Its director, Kotaro Kake, is a friend of Abe's.  The government has not granted such an approval in decades due to a perceived glut of veterinarians. Abe and his aides have denied doing Kake any favors. Potentially more devastating is the impression among many voters that Abe and his inner circle have grown arrogant.  We must accept the results humbly,  said Hakubun Shimomura, a close Abe ally and head of the LDP's Tokyo chapter.  The voters have handed down an extremely severe verdict.  Abe is expected to reshuffle his cabinet in coming months in an effort to repair his damaged ratings, a step often taken by beleaguered leaders but one that can backfire if novice ministers become embroiled in scandals or commit gaffes. Among those many political insiders expected to be replaced is Defence Minister Tomomi Inada. Inada's remark during the Tokyo campaign seeking voter support in the name of the Self-Defence Forces, as the military is known, came under heavy fire. By law, the military is required to be politically neutral.

Analysts said concerns over a proposed tax bill weighed on overall investor sentiment. But foreign investors continued to snap up the island nation's risky assets. The Colombo stock index ended down 0.21 percent at 6,733.06, slipping from its highest close since Jan. 7, 2016, hit on Friday. The bourse climbed 0.47 percent last week, and gained 1.09 percent in June. Foreign investors, however, net bought 189.1 million rupees ($1.23 million) worth of shares on Monday, extending their year-to-date net inflow to 22.4 billion rupees worth of equities.  A few selected big caps brought the market down, especially the selling in Keells,  said Dimantha Mathew, head of research, First Capital Holdings PLC.  Local participation is still low, but foreign investors are seen to continue and drive up the volumes.  Brokers said local investors have been waiting for some clarity on the proposed inland revenue legislation, which some companies expect will result in higher cost of production. The IMF, which has long urged Sri Lanka to boost tax revenue through modernisation and simplification of its fiscal system, has urged the government to submit to parliament a new Inland Revenue Act.

Pluralism has always been a part of Indonesia's DNA,  Joko Widodo told Reuters in an interview at the presidential palace in Jakarta.  Despite many challenges, Islam in Indonesia has always been a force for moderation.  Indonesia's state ideology includes national unity, social justice and democracy alongside belief in God, and enshrines religious diversity in a secular system of government. Hardline Islamist groups were banned under the authoritarian regime of President Suharto, which ended in 1998, but they have gained ground in recent years, emerging from the fringes of society in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country. Religious and political tensions spiralled at the end of last year when Islamists led protests by hundreds of thousands in Jakarta against the capital's then governor, an ethnic-Chinese Christian who was charged with insulting the Koran. Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ally of President Widodo, lost his bid for re-election to a Muslim rival in April after months of agitation against him by a radical group, the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI). In May he was sentenced to two years in jail for blasphemy. Widodo said Indonesia was  still a model  of pluralism and noted comments on Saturday by former U.S. President Barack Obama - on a personal visit to the country where he spent some of his childhood - that its history of tolerance must be preserved.  It is very important here in Indonesia, the United States, Europe, everywhere, to fight against the politics of 'us and them',  Obama told a conference in Jakarta. Careful Line on Homosexuality The targets of hardline Islamic groups have included the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, many of whom have been driven underground by police raids. With the exception of the ultra-conservative Aceh province, where Islamic law is enforced and two men were publicly flogged in May for gay sex, homosexuality is legal in Indonesia. But Widodo's own defence minister has branded homosexuality a national security threat and last week a leader of Indonesia's second-largest Muslim group called for a boycott of Starbucks because of the international coffee chain's pro-gay stand. The president trod a careful line on the question of LGBT rights, saying that  Indonesia remains a tolerant nation  whose constitution guarantees that everyone's rights are respected and protected. But he added:  We are the largest majority Muslim country so Indonesia has its own religious norms, unique values and also cultures that must be respected.  Isis Has No Place in Indonesia The muscle-flexing of hardline groups has fed fears that Indonesia will become fertile ground for Islamist militants. The attempt in May by a small army of Islamic State-allied fighters to overrun a city in the southern Philippines has been widely seen as a bid by the ultra-radical group, on a backfoot in Syria and Iraq, to establish a stronghold in Southeast Asia. Philippines officials have said there were Indonesians and Malaysians among the fighters who attacked Marawi City, where a battle with government troops has ground on for six weeks.  ISIS has no place in Indonesia,  Widodo said, using a popular acronym for Islamic State. He noted that Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines had agreed to joint maritime patrols to prevent militants moving across their islands, and said he discussed cooperation on a phone call with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte last week.  Our security and intelligence agencies continue to work hard to combat this threat. We are also continuing to promote the values of moderate Islam and when I talked with President Duterte last week I said that 'your problem is my problem'.

Signs of a shift towards policy tightening last week from central bank officials outside the United States drove the euro above $1.14 to its highest in over a year, but the support of higher market interest rates continues to favour the greenback. German 10-year bond yields have jumped more than 20 basis points in the past week but remain close to 2 full percentage points lower than their U.S. equivalent. Yen yields are another 40 basis points lower.  The reason why U.S. yields have gone up is important: they have been following European yields higher in the past week,  said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.  What that tells you is that dollar yen is the safest dollar long and dollar yen is near the highs. Our base case remains that U.S. data rebounds sufficiently to allow the market to price in more (tightening) from the Fed than it does currently.  In a session set to be quietened by the absence of many traders before the U.S. July 4 holiday, the dollar gained 0.6 percent to break above 113 yen for the first time since mid-May. It rose half a percent to $1.1373 per euro, generating a similar gain for the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength.  Even as significant parts of rest of the world has been hawkishly repriced, pushing the broad USD to fresh lows, none of these developments invalidate the thesis that U.S. rates need to more fully price in the Fed (raising rates),  JP Morgan's Daniel Hui said in a weekly note on FX markets.  Retaining some form of long USD exposure on Fed repricing still makes sense.  Ahead of Tuesday's meeting of Sweden's Riksbank, Hui was also the latest analyst to recommend buying the crown, in this case against the yen, on the expectation that the central bank may also turn more hawkish on the policy outlook. Any shift in the wording of the Reserve Bank of Australia's statement, also early on Tuesday European time, may also support the Aussie, which was 0.8 percent off last week's highs on Monday. Data on Monday went against sterling, which fell around half a percent in morning trade in London after a dip to a three-month low in the PMI index of manufacturing sector purchasing managers, far worse than expected. Many bank strategists expect activity data over the coming months to quell expectations, currently above 50 percent, for a rise in Bank of England borrowing rates this year.  Today’s PMI release poses a challenge for the BoE’s hawks, possibly contradicting the view that activity and inflation will surprise to the upside in 2017,  Barclays economists said in a flash note after the data.

It appealed to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, sometimes called the 'world court', to fix maritime boundaries in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and to declare Nicaragua's establishment of a military post on a beach on Isla Calero illegal. Nicaragua, which lost a similar case to Costa Rica in 2015, was expected to put its counter-arguments to the court on Thursday. The countries have a handful of claims and counter-claims before the ICJ mostly centering on the mouth of the San Juan river and the Isla Calero, a virtually uninhabited area claimed by both states.  According to Costa Rica, Nicaragua's new military camp is on territory designated as belonging to Costa Rica under a December 2015 decision by the ICJ.

Germany was taken by surprise by the vote, which was called suddenly, leaving little time for debate. It came after three parties who could enter a coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives after a September election set the legalization of gay  marriage as a condition for their support. But the same-sex bill faces opposition from some members of Merkel's conservative bloc and others on the right. Merkel herself voted against it on Friday, but it went through with 393 lawmakers in the Bundestag voting in favor versus 226 against.       Now a group of conservative lawmakers is considering taking the issue to the Constitutional Court, German newspaper Die Welt reported.  The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party may also file a complaint to the court, said AfD top election candidate Alexander Gauland.  I'm in favor of taking such a step,  he told Bild am Sonntag newspaper. People celebrate Germany's parliament legalising the same-sex marriage in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany June 30, 2017.Fabrizio BenschAlthough Germany's constitution does not explicitly say so, critics argue the term marriage can only apply to a man and a woman.  For me, marriage in the Constitution is marriage between a man and a woman and that is why I did not vote in favor of this bill today,  Merkel said on Friday. Merkel is running for a fourth term in a Sept. 24 election. Polls show her conservatives are by far the most popular party but would need a coalition partner - most likely the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), Social Democrats (SPD) or Greens, all of which made legalizing gay marriage a condition for a tie-up. Johannes Singhammer, a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's conservatives - said he recommended putting the issue to the Constitutional Court to achieve legal clarity. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere also voted against the move. He told Bild am Sonntag that as a trained lawyer he believed it required an amendment to the constitution, a view shared by a former president of the Constitutional Court, Hans-Juergen Papier, according to other media. Germany is in the process of unwinding a legacy of virulent homophobia. Earlier this year, parliament agreed to grant compensation to thousands of gay men jailed under a 19th century law that was strengthened by the Nazis and only dropped in 1969 when homosexuality was decriminalized in West Germany. The same-sex bill is expected to get signed into law after July 7. This makes Germany the 23rd country to legalize same-sex marriage, according to gay rights group GLAAD.

It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case. Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days. Simplified: Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

Germany was taken by surprise by the vote, which was called suddenly, leaving little time for debate. It came after three parties who could enter a coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives after a September election set the legalization of gay  marriage as a condition for their support. But the same-sex bill faces opposition from some members of Merkel's conservative bloc and others on the right. Merkel herself voted against it on Friday, but it went through with 393 lawmakers in the Bundestag voting in favor versus 226 against.       Now a group of conservative lawmakers is considering taking the issue to the Constitutional Court, German newspaper Die Welt reported.  The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party may also file a complaint to the court, said AfD top election candidate Alexander Gauland.  I'm in favor of taking such a step,  he told Bild am Sonntag newspaper. People celebrate Germany's parliament legalising the same-sex marriage in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany June 30, 2017.Fabrizio BenschAlthough Germany's constitution does not explicitly say so, critics argue the term marriage can only apply to a man and a woman.  For me, marriage in the Constitution is marriage between a man and a woman and that is why I did not vote in favor of this bill today,  Merkel said on Friday. Merkel is running for a fourth term in a Sept. 24 election. Polls show her conservatives are by far the most popular party but would need a coalition partner - most likely the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), Social Democrats (SPD) or Greens, all of which made legalizing gay marriage a condition for a tie-up. Johannes Singhammer, a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's conservatives - said he recommended putting the issue to the Constitutional Court to achieve legal clarity. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere also voted against the move. He told Bild am Sonntag that as a trained lawyer he believed it required an amendment to the constitution, a view shared by a former president of the Constitutional Court, Hans-Juergen Papier, according to other media. Germany is in the process of unwinding a legacy of virulent homophobia. Earlier this year, parliament agreed to grant compensation to thousands of gay men jailed under a 19th century law that was strengthened by the Nazis and only dropped in 1969 when homosexuality was decriminalized in West Germany. The same-sex bill is expected to get signed into law after July 7. This makes Germany the 23rd country to legalize same-sex marriage, according to gay rights group GLAAD.

We expect a greater inflow from foreign investors now that the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has ended the USD100,000 annual cap on the amount that account holders can transfer outside Egypt. The removal of the cap last month, a requirement of Egypt's lending programme with the International Monetary Fund, should reduce foreign investors' concerns that investments could be trapped in Egypt. The restrictions were put in place in 2011 to limit capital outflows after the political uprising, but the political and macroeconomic backdrop has since become more stable, reducing the risk of outflows. Under the flexible exchange rate regime in place since Egypt's currency flotation in November 2016, banks have better access to FC liquidity through the interbank market and depositors swapping their FC deposits into higher-yielding local-currency deposits or certificates of deposit. The CBE previously used FC auctions to preserve the exchange rate, which restricted FC liquidity. There are already signs of an improvement in banks' FC positions following the sharp depreciation of the Egyptian pound after the currency flotation and Egypt's USD4 billion Eurobond issuance in January 2017. The sector's FC loans/deposits ratio fell by 3.7pp in 1Q17, having risen to more than 66% in 2016. <iframe allowfullscreen src= //e.infogram.com/egyptian_banksfc_loansdeposits?src=embed  title= Egyptian Banks: FC Loans/Deposits  width= 800  height= 567  scrolling= no  frameborder= 0 > The ratio is still high, in our opinion, given the weak operating environment, but we expect it to fall further, helped by the lower pound, a further USD3 billion Eurobond issuance in May and the removal of the FC transfer cap. While greater FC availability will increase banks' ability to lend to FC borrowers, we expect the rise in lending to be limited given the subdued economy and recent interest rate rises, helping to bring down the FC loans/deposits ratio. In contrast to tight FC liquidity, Egyptian banks have excess local-currency liquidity, which they are deploying in government bond auctions. Egyptian sovereign debt accounts for 30%-50% of banks' balance sheets and is the main credit risk for banks. Any change in Egypt's sovereign rating (B/Stable), which we affirmed on 22 June, would probably be mirrored in Egyptian banks' Issuer Default Ratings.

Global investors were active, purchasing 4.9 billion yuan ($721.4 million) of bonds through the program on Monday. But traders and foreign investors warned against reading too much into first-day trading numbers.   Chinese institutions will have to meet their 'supportive obligations',  to ensure the successful launch of the program, said a Shanghai-based trader.  Let's wait to see one-week or one-month volume.  Monday's aggregate trading volume was 7.05 billion yuan, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System said on its website. HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) and an asset management unit of Bank of China were the among the first to complete trades using the scheme. The launch of the connection was timed to coincide with the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule and initial trading will only be  northbound , meaning foreign investors will be able to buy and sell Chinese bonds. No launch date has been set for the southbound channel. Demand for such a channel was limited, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEx) chief executive Charles Li said. Credit Suisse Private Banking reiterated on Monday that it is negative on onshore bonds and expects yields to rise further this year. In line with broader foreign access rules, overseas investors including pension funds, central banks and sovereign wealth funds will be eligible to trade sovereign and local government bonds, policy bank bonds and corporate debt on the Bond Connect. The connection will increase the supply of yuan-denominated assets that can be held by global investors as Beijing steps up the internationalization of its currency. In a note on Monday, Goldman Sachs said it holds the view that more than $1 trillion of global fixed income investments could be allocated to domestic Chinese bonds in the next decade.  Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam speaks at the opening ceremony of Bond Connect at Hong Kong Exchanges in Hong Kong, China July 3, 2017.Bobby YipSuch inflows could help to support the yuan's value in the long run. Internationalization Concerns However, some market watchers said a strong launch could hamper the currency's internationalization.  A successful Bond Connect operation will actually be counterproductive to renminbi internationalization in the short-term. This is because it will lead to more renminbi flowing back to China and, thus, further erode the CNH pool,  said Chi Lo, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. Slideshow (2 Images)Chinese regulators formally approved the Bond Connect scheme in May. International investors have been allowed direct access to China's interbank bond market since last year and some market participants have questioned the need for an additional trading scheme.  Reluctance by overseas investors to enter the market amid fears over the stability of the Chinese yuan, and over potential delays to Beijing's reforms of the capital markets has kept overseas holdings to less than 2 percent. This is below the international norm of about 10 percent, BNP Paribas said. Media reports said 20 market makers for the Bond Connect scheme had been approved, including 14 Chinese and six overseas institutions. BNP Paribas said it had received approval as a market maker and had also executed its first trade under the scheme. Citigroup and Standard Chartered also confirmed to Reuters that they had been approved as official dealers. The scheme will also see deals coming through the primary market. China Development Bank [CHDB.UL] said it planned to issue up to 20 billion yuan ($2.95 billion) of one-year, three-year and 10-year fixed-rate bonds for tender on Monday. HSBC said it is one of the underwriters. Hong Kong's new leader, Carrie Lam, attended the debut ceremony and said the connect scheme marked  another new chapter in the development of mutual capital markets access between the mainland and Hong Kong.       The bond program follows the launch of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Stock Connect scheme in November 2014 and the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock program in December 2016.

Global investors were active, purchasing 4.9 billion yuan ($721.4 million) of bonds through the program on Monday. But traders and foreign investors warned against reading too much into first-day trading numbers.   Chinese institutions will have to meet their 'supportive obligations',  to ensure the successful launch of the program, said a Shanghai-based trader.  Let's wait to see one-week or one-month volume.  Monday's aggregate trading volume was 7.05 billion yuan, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System said on its website. HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) and an asset management unit of Bank of China were the among the first to complete trades using the scheme. The launch of the connection was timed to coincide with the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule and initial trading will only be  northbound , meaning foreign investors will be able to buy and sell Chinese bonds. No launch date has been set for the southbound channel. Demand for such a channel was limited, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEx) chief executive Charles Li said. Credit Suisse Private Banking reiterated on Monday that it is negative on onshore bonds and expects yields to rise further this year. In line with broader foreign access rules, overseas investors including pension funds, central banks and sovereign wealth funds will be eligible to trade sovereign and local government bonds, policy bank bonds and corporate debt on the Bond Connect. The connection will increase the supply of yuan-denominated assets that can be held by global investors as Beijing steps up the internationalization of its currency. In a note on Monday, Goldman Sachs said it holds the view that more than $1 trillion of global fixed income investments could be allocated to domestic Chinese bonds in the next decade.  Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam speaks at the opening ceremony of Bond Connect at Hong Kong Exchanges in Hong Kong, China July 3, 2017.Bobby YipSuch inflows could help to support the yuan's value in the long run. Internationalization Concerns However, some market watchers said a strong launch could hamper the currency's internationalization.  A successful Bond Connect operation will actually be counterproductive to renminbi internationalization in the short-term. This is because it will lead to more renminbi flowing back to China and, thus, further erode the CNH pool,  said Chi Lo, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. Slideshow (2 Images)Chinese regulators formally approved the Bond Connect scheme in May. International investors have been allowed direct access to China's interbank bond market since last year and some market participants have questioned the need for an additional trading scheme.  Reluctance by overseas investors to enter the market amid fears over the stability of the Chinese yuan, and over potential delays to Beijing's reforms of the capital markets has kept overseas holdings to less than 2 percent. This is below the international norm of about 10 percent, BNP Paribas said. Media reports said 20 market makers for the Bond Connect scheme had been approved, including 14 Chinese and six overseas institutions. BNP Paribas said it had received approval as a market maker and had also executed its first trade under the scheme. Citigroup and Standard Chartered also confirmed to Reuters that they had been approved as official dealers. The scheme will also see deals coming through the primary market. China Development Bank [CHDB.UL] said it planned to issue up to 20 billion yuan ($2.95 billion) of one-year, three-year and 10-year fixed-rate bonds for tender on Monday. HSBC said it is one of the underwriters. Hong Kong's new leader, Carrie Lam, attended the debut ceremony and said the connect scheme marked  another new chapter in the development of mutual capital markets access between the mainland and Hong Kong.       The bond program follows the launch of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Stock Connect scheme in November 2014 and the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock program in December 2016. Those two schemes allow both northbound and southbound trade.

Factories in the euro zone rounded off the first half of 2017 by ramping up at the fastest rate for over six years while Asia's tech-manufacturing economies were helped by growing global demand for electronics products. But British manufacturing grew more slowly than anyone polled by Reuters expected as consumers faced the double-hit of accelerating inflation - caused in large part by the fall in the pound since last year's vote to leave the EU - and slowing wage growth. Monday's survey suggested the supposed silver lining of a weakened pound - more competitive exports - is proving elusive and could make Bank of England officials think twice about raising interest rates. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 54.3 from a downwardly-revised 56.3 in May, a three-month low and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that pointed to a reading of 56.5. A reading above 50 indicates growth.  The decline in the PMI in June robustly challenges hopes that manufacturing and exports will pick up and offset the consumer spending slowdown. Today's manufacturing report weakens the case for raising interest rates soon,  said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics. June's manufacturing PMI for the euro zone rose to 57.4, its highest since April 2011 and up from May's 57.0. Suggesting the bloc's momentum will continue into the second half, new orders rose at the fastest rate since early 2011, backlogs of work increased at the fastest pace in over 13 years, raw materials were depleted and factories increased headcount at a near-record pace. The upturn came alongside factories increasing prices, as they have done for nine months, welcome news for policymakers at the European Central Bank who have been battling for years to get inflation back to their 2 percent target ceiling. Inflation was a stronger-than-expected 1.3 percent in June, official flash data showed on Friday, and while still below target, recent strong economic data meant ECB chief Mario Draghi last week raised the prospect of policy tightening. A member of the staff works on an assembly line at a factory in Fuyang, Anhui province, China, April 17, 2017. China Daily/via REUTERSIn Britain, central banker have started to signal that a first rate hike in a decade might be approaching to help curb the sharp rise in inflation. BoE Governor Mark Carney says he is watching to see how the economy copes with the launch of Brexit talks and whether weakness among consumers could be offset by investment and exports. Asia Acceleration     Private sector surveys of manufacturers in Asia showed factories in China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan picked up in June, driven largely by a recovery in exports. But continued declines in energy prices, which weighed on manufacturing in Indonesia and Malaysia, could hurt these two economies, while in India, sluggish domestic demand offset strong foreign demand and led to a slowdown. Factory PMIs for South Korea, Japan, Taiwan Vietnam and India all remained above 50. And all of them, except for Japan and India, rose from May.   But the ability for manufacturers to continue to accelerate, or to maintain sharp surges in production, is in question given underlying demand, apart from some bright spots, doesn't seem to have permeated more widely across the different sectors,  said Vishnu Varathan at Mizuho Bank. While manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in three months in June in China, business confidence slumped to its lowest level this year amid a government crackdown on debt risks and tightening financial conditions.  We believe cyclical momentum (in China) has likely peaked and will ease further due to tighter financial conditions,  Yin Zhang and Helen Qiao at Merrill Lynch wrote in a note.   Looking ahead, since overall growth is still higher than the policy target level at around 6.5 percent for real GDP, we expect policy makers to maintain the tightening bias in (the second half), which is likely to impose downward pressure on growth until early 2018.  In Japan, confidence among big manufacturers hit its highest level in over three years in June, according to a survey from the central bank published on Monday. editing by John Stonestreet","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-economy-idUSKBN19O0CR"},

Romania's ruling Social Democrats announced a tax overhaul for 2018 in June, ditching a flat 16 percent tax on income and profit that has attracted investment into the European Union's fastest-growing but least-developed economy. The government's planned changes include a mix of cuts to existing taxes, introducing new levies and postponing a value added tax cut by one year. Tax measures are doubled by promises to hike public sector wages, the minimum pay and state pensions. The plans were announced without prior consultation or an impact assessment, and the leu, debt yields and stocks fell at the end of June. It was unclear whether the government would actually change taxation in time for 2018. Meanwhile, Romania was the EU's fastest-growing economy in the first quarter. Romanian inflation stood at 0.6 percent at the end of May. The central bank forecasts inflation will reach 1.6 percent at the end of the year, but that wage hikes and strong domestic demand will push it to 3.1 percent by the end of 2018. It targets inflation at 1.5-3.5 percent this year and next. Eight of ten analysts polled by Reuters expect the bank to keep its key interest rate unchanged at the end of the year. The central bank has signalled that any first change to monetary policy may come not via its key rate but by narrowing the gap between its lending and deposit rates, which would in turn affect interbank rates.  Looking ahead, we think that core price pressures will soon start to build,  Capital Economics said in a research note, adding they expected policymakers to raise interest rates towards the end of the year.  The economy is now operating at full employment. Accordingly, the combination of loose fiscal policy, double-digit wage growth and accelerating credit growth – coupled with the unwinding impact of previous VAT cuts – will push inflation up sharply in the coming months.  The Romanian leu inched 0.1 percent lower against the euro to 4.5605 at 1045 GMT. Governor Mugur Isarescu is expected to provide details on Monday's decision from 1200 GMT.

Renaissance Technologies, staffed by nearly eight dozen scientists with doctorates in physics, math and other fields, captured more than $3 billion in new money in the first five months of the year, according to two people familiar with the figures, which have not been previously reported. Compared with the $4.6 billion that all quantitative funds tracked by Hedge Fund Research took in during the first three months of the year, Renaissance's haul is even more remarkable, fund managers and industry analysts said. Long Island-based Renaissance, founded 35 years ago by mathematician James Simons, has attracted investors based on the strong returns of its portfolios as well as shifting investor tastes. Years of lackluster returns and high fees at hedge funds have frustrated big investors, who are increasingly swapping funds run by stock-pickers like John Paulson or Leon Cooperman for quants, which rely on mathematical models to make their bets. Last year, investors pulled some $70 billion out of all hedge funds, but they added $13.3 billion in new money to quant funds, data from Hedge Fund Research show. In the first quarter of 2017, investors pulled $5.5 billion out of all hedge funds, compared with inflows of $4.6 billion into quant funds. The trend is expected to continue, as investors have come around to the idea that algorithms can make better decisions than human stock-pickers, especially when markets are volatile or uncertain. While Renaissance and well-known competitors like D.E. Shaw and AQR have been around for decades, they have become newly popular after a run of strong returns, as has a growing crop of smaller rivals. Another stand-out fund that has been pulling in hundreds of millions in recent months is Quantitative Investment Management, which manages roughly $3.5 billion in several strategies. Its Quantitative Tactical Aggressive Fund gained 55 percent in the first five months of 2017. Putri Pascualy, a managing director at PAAMCO, which invests in hedge funds, said it is  no surprise  that high-return quantitative strategies like Renaissance’s have been gathering assets, since investors have been moving broadly toward either algorithm-based funds or those that invest in illiquid assets, like private credit. Renaissance manages $50 billion in total. It offers outside investors access to three portfolios that jointly oversee $34 billion, up from roughly $26 billion late last year. Two of the portfolios are up roughly 13 percent through the middle of June, and the other has gained about 9 percent. That easily outpaces the roughly 5.75 percent gain that large quant firms specializing in equity investments have earned this year, eVestment data show. Quant funds with less than $1 billion in assets that specialize in stocks returned roughly 1.8 percent this year. A Renaissance spokesman declined to comment. The Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund is the oldest portfolio available to outsiders, launched in 2005. Last year it returned 21 percent. Seven years later the firm created the Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha Fund , which gained 10 percent in 2016. Last year it unveiled the Renaissance Institutional Diversified Global Equity Fund. It is not clear to which Renaissance fund investors directed the new assets. The firm's Medallion Fund, which is said to have produced some $55 billion in profits over the last three decades, is available only to insiders. Several investors said current demand for Renaissance's funds is largely fueled by recent strong performance. Roughly four years ago the funds hit a rough spot but then recovered.  There has been a lot of performance chasing here, and it is yet to be determined how they'll do in pulling in money over the longer term,  one investor said.

Factories in the euro zone rounded off the first half of 2017 by ramping up at the fastest rate for over six years while Asia's tech-manufacturing economies were helped by growing global demand for electronics products. But British manufacturing grew more slowly than anyone polled by Reuters expected as consumers faced the double-hit of accelerating inflation - caused in large part by the fall in the pound since last year's vote to leave the EU - and slowing wage growth. Monday's survey suggested the supposed silver lining of a weakened pound - more competitive exports - is proving elusive and could make Bank of England officials think twice about raising interest rates. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 54.3 from a downwardly-revised 56.3 in May, a three-month low and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that pointed to a reading of 56.5. A reading above 50 indicates growth.  The decline in the PMI in June robustly challenges hopes that manufacturing and exports will pick up and offset the consumer spending slowdown. Today's manufacturing report weakens the case for raising interest rates soon,  said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics. June's manufacturing PMI for the euro zone rose to 57.4, its highest since April 2011 and up from May's 57.0. Suggesting the bloc's momentum will continue into the second half, new orders rose at the fastest rate since early 2011, backlogs of work increased at the fastest pace in over 13 years, raw materials were depleted and factories increased headcount at a near-record pace. The upturn came alongside factories increasing prices, as they have done for nine months, welcome news for policymakers at the European Central Bank who have been battling for years to get inflation back to their 2 percent target ceiling. Inflation was a stronger-than-expected 1.3 percent in June, official flash data showed on Friday, and while still below target, recent strong economic data meant ECB chief Mario Draghi last week raised the prospect of policy tightening. A member of the staff works on an assembly line at a factory in Fuyang, Anhui province, China, April 17, 2017. China Daily/via REUTERSIn Britain, central banker have started to signal that a first rate hike in a decade might be approaching to help curb the sharp rise in inflation. BoE Governor Mark Carney says he is watching to see how the economy copes with the launch of Brexit talks and whether weakness among consumers could be offset by investment and exports. Asia Acceleration     Private sector surveys of manufacturers in Asia showed factories in China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan picked up in June, driven largely by a recovery in exports. But continued declines in energy prices, which weighed on manufacturing in Indonesia and Malaysia, could hurt these two economies, while in India, sluggish domestic demand offset strong foreign demand and led to a slowdown. Factory PMIs for South Korea, Japan, Taiwan Vietnam and India all remained above 50. And all of them, except for Japan and India, rose from May.   But the ability for manufacturers to continue to accelerate, or to maintain sharp surges in production, is in question given underlying demand, apart from some bright spots, doesn't seem to have permeated more widely across the different sectors,  said Vishnu Varathan at Mizuho Bank. While manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in three months in June in China, business confidence slumped to its lowest level this year amid a government crackdown on debt risks and tightening financial conditions.  We believe cyclical momentum (in China) has likely peaked and will ease further due to tighter financial conditions,  Yin Zhang and Helen Qiao at Merrill Lynch wrote in a note.   Looking ahead, since overall growth is still higher than the policy target level at around 6.5 percent for real GDP, we expect policy makers to maintain the tightening bias in (the second half), which is likely to impose downward pressure on growth until early 2018.  In Japan, confidence among big manufacturers hit its highest level in over three years in June, according to a survey from the central bank published on Monday. editing by John Stonestreet","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-economy-idUSL8N1JU1B5"},

The authorities said it was one of three car bombs that were meant to be blown up in crowded areas of the capital on Sunday, the first day back to work from the Eid al-Fitr holiday. Security forces pursued and destroyed the other two. Officials said the bombers had been prevented from reaching their intended targets, otherwise the casualty toll would have been higher. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Damascus was hit by two separate, multiple suicide bomb attacks in March, one of them claimed by Islamic State and the other by the Islamist insurgent alliance Tahrir al-Sham. In a letter to the U.N. secretary general and the head of the security council, the foreign ministry said the blast that killed 20 people in the Bab Touma area near the Old City had also wounded dozens of women and children.  State media said the bomber had been spotted and pursued by the security forces and set off the bomb after he had been encircled in the area.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack. On March 11, a double suicide attack in the capital killed scores of people, most of them Iraqi Shi'ite pilgrims. That attack was claimed by the Tahrir al-Sham alliance of Islamist insurgents, which is spearheaded by a jihadist group formerly known as the Nusra Front. Syrian government forces, which have defeated rebel fighters in several suburbs of Damascus over the last year, are currently battling insurgents in the Jobar and Ain Tarma areas on the capital's eastern outskirts.

The spokesman said the government had already accepted the recommendations of pay bodies representing professions such as nurses and doctors, and would consider others in the normal way as and when they presented their cases.  We will be responding later this year. Some have reported to us and we've accepted the findings, others we will respond to in due course, but I think you can expect them ... in and around the Autumn,  he said.

Joshua beat Klitschko after 11 rounds to extend his unbeaten streak to 19 fights, and a clause in their contracts allows the defeated fighter to ask for a rematch. But the 41-year-old is yet to make decision about his future. The 27-year-old has to fight Pulev, who is the mandatory challenger for the IBF title, and Joshua is ready to fight the 36-year-old if the Klitschko rematch does not take place.  The ball is in Klitschko's court,  Joshua told Sky Sports.  I am going to continue my career. It is up to him whether he wants to have a rematch or whether he says, 'You know what, that's enough'.  But I think, whatever he decides to do, we all respect him, and plan B would be look at the option with Pulev, and where we would fight him and the options available for the Pulev fight.  Now I have the IBF, WBA and IBO (belts) there are obligations with mandatory challenges, and Pulev is one.  So either it will be Klitschko, which would be great, or Pulev, which would be great. I am not bothered either way.  The Briton is hopeful that a showdown in Las Vegas will tempt Klitschko to opt for a rematch.  Vegas - it is the Mecca of boxing, and this is an opportunity,  Joshua said.  People wouldn't mind traveling, and it is a nice big hurrah for himself. He has achieved so much, does he have the motivation?  I think Vegas will get his blood boiling again.

The founding family will seek a court injunction to block the share issue, a lawyer for the family said in a statement. The family of founder Sazo Idemitsu, including octogenarian son Shosuke Idemitsu - a former president of the company and now honorary chairman, say a merger with Showa Shell Sekiyu would not work as the businesses were too different. With control of over a third of the refiner, the family has the right to veto special items such as a merger. But Idemitsu Kosan's planned sale of 48 million new shares would reduce the stake to about 26 percent, a calculation by Thomson Reuters shows, taking away the family's right to veto. A company spokesman, however, said the purpose of the share sale was to raise necessary funds and not to dilute the founding family's stake, and that Idemitsu Kosan had no plans to hold a shareholders meeting to vote on the merger after the issuance. Daiwa Securities and JP Morgan are joint global coordinators for the share offering, which is expected to raise 138.5 billion yen ($1.23 billion). Idemitsu Kosan said it would use part of the proceeds to repay 159 billion yen of loans taken to fund the acquisition of a stake in Showa Shell. In a regulatory filing, Idemitsu Kosan said it would take counter action in case shareholders take legal action to block the share issue, but warned the sale would be cancelled if court injunction is granted and stays beyond the pay-in date. Yohei Tsuruma, the lawyer who represents the founding family, said in a statement:  It's obvious that it will dilute the founding family's stake and we are planning to apply for court injunction to block the share issue.  Overcoming opposition from the founding family, last week, Idemitsu Kosan's CEO Takashi Tsukioka, who has been pushing for a full merger with Showa Shell, was re-elected to the company's board at an annual shareholders' meeting. Idemitsu Kosan shares closed up 2.2 percent on Monday, outstripping a 0.1 percent rise in the Nikkei.

A private survey showed that China's manufacturing engine cranked back into growth mode in June, expanding at the fastest pace in three months after unexpectedly contracting in May      China's manufacturing PMI rebound is a silver lining and overall inflation is likely to be contained despite bottoming,  Mizuho Bank analysts said in a note.     Reopening after a long holiday, the Jakarta Composite Index  closed at a record high with telecommunication and financial stocks leading gains.     Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Persero) TBK PT rose 6 percent to end at a record high.     Indonesia's annual inflation rate accelerated slightly in June as demand increased in the days leading to the Eid al-Fitr celebrations at the end of the month, the statistics bureau said.     Thai shares closed 0.3 percent up as all sectors gained.     Thailand's annual headline consumer prices fell for a second straight month in June, mainly due to lower food prices, government data showed.     Meanwhile, a Reuters poll showed that Thailand's central bank will keep its low benchmark interest rate as economic recovery is slow and household debt levels are high.     Philippine stocks closed 0.3 percent higher, led by real estate and financials. Property developer Ayala Land  closed 1.6 percent up while Bank of the Philippine Islands ended the day 0.6 percent higher.     Malaysian shares gained 0.3 percent as consumer and materials stocks rose.      Vietnam extended gains into a fourth consecutive session and closed the day 0.3 percent higher     Singapore ended marginally lower, hurt mainly by financial stocks.

Parents and teachers have complained that children were becoming addicted to the multiplayer online battle game, which, according to the company, has more than 200 million users, mostly in China, and is the top-grossing mobile game in the world.  From Tuesday, users below 12 years of age will be limited to one hour of play time each day, while those aged between 12 years and 18 years will be limited to two hours a day, Tencent said. Tencent did not say whether the limits will be imposed only in China or elsewhere too. The firm also plans to ban users under 12 years from logging in after 9 p.m. (1300 GMT) and will impose further restrictions on how much money younger users spend on the game, it added.     The fantasy role-playing game based on Chinese historical characters is the world's top-grossing game by worldwide iOS + Google Play revenue in May, according to mobile data intelligence firm App Annie's latest monthly index. It grossed on average $84 million per month on iOS in China in the first five months of the year, App Annie data showed.  More than half of its users are below 24 years of age, including more than a quarter below 19 years, according to Chinese mobile data firm Jiguang.  The game, which involves violence, became the subject of controversy after Chinese media reports in recent months of serious addiction to it among young people.   There are no rules to prevent indulgence in mobile games in China, but we decided to be the first to try to dispel parental worries by limiting play time and forcing children to log off,  Tencent said on its official WeChat account.     Tencent, which has a portfolio of over 200 games, also said it would upgrade a parental-control platform rolled out earlier this year that makes it easier for parents to monitor their children's gaming account activities. It will also step up the requirement of real-name registration for all users, it said. Accounts that do not provide real-name information will be treated as below-12, Tencent said.  Chinese gaming industry database CNG estimates the game raked in a revenue of more than 5.5 billion yuan ($810.47 million) in the first quarter, accounting for nearly half of Tencent's smartphone games revenue of 12.9 billion yuan in the period.  Tencent declined to comment on the estimates.  Honour of Kings doubled its monthly active users to 163 million in the past six months, according to Jiguang, while China's mobile gaming revenue grew by 4.5 billion yuan to 27.5 billion yuan over the period, the biggest growth in two years, according to CNG.  China is the world's largest gaming market by revenue, and is expected to account for roughly 25 percent of global game sales in 2017, according to research firm NewZoo.

The Indian said they would be allowed to continue racing without the need to be reined in, however.  It’s still frustrating to ponder what might have been had things played out differently,  Mallya said in a preview for Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix in Spielberg, the race following on from Baku.  Since Baku we’ve had some conversations internally and reminded our drivers that the team must always come first. It’s never acceptable for team mates to make contact with each other and it certainly cost us points in Baku,  added Mallya.  However, the events of Azerbaijan won’t change our approach. Our drivers can race freely and I’m sure they have learned some valuable lessons ... I know they are mature enough to work together for the good of the team.  Force India, currently fourth overall in the constructors' championship, have yet to win a race since Mallya arrived in 2008 and renamed a team that had gone through various previous guises as Jordan, Midland and Spyker.

Of the cars ahead of them at the time, Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton lost the lead after pitting to fix a loose headrest while Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was handed a 10 second stop and go penalty and finished fourth.  Vettel got his penalty due to that restart, so we would have beaten him. And (Red Bull's eventual winner Daniel) Ricciardo we would have beaten,  said chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer after the race.  But without us causing the red flag, Hamilton’s headrest wouldn’t have come up, so he would have won it. So, would have, could have, should have ... we still would have been second or third.

There are no rules to prevent indulgence in mobile games in China, but we decided to be the first to try to dispel parental worries by limiting play time and forcing children to log off,  Tencent said on its official WeChat account.     Tencent, which has a portfolio of over 200 games, also said it would upgrade a parental-control platform rolled out earlier this year that makes it easier for parents to monitor their children's gaming account activities. It will also step up the requirement of real-name registration for all users, it said. Accounts that do not provide real-name information will be treated as below-12, Tencent said.  Chinese gaming industry database CNG estimates the game raked in a revenue of more than 5.5 billion yuan ($810.47 million) in the first quarter, accounting for nearly half of Tencent's smartphone games revenue of 12.9 billion yuan in the period.  Tencent declined to comment on the estimates.  Honour of Kings doubled its monthly active users to 163 million in the past six months, according to Jiguang, while China's mobile gaming revenue grew by 4.5 billion yuan to 27.5 billion yuan over the period, the biggest growth in two years, according to CNG.  China is the world's largest gaming market by revenue, and is expected to account for roughly 25 percent of global game sales in 2017, according to research firm NewZoo.

Water levels in more than 60 rivers in southern China have risen above warning levels, the flood control authority said.      Thirty-three people are confirmed dead and 15 missing as of Monday morning after heavy rain and flooding engulfed provinces central and southern provinces including Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Sichuan and Guizhou, China's civil affairs ministry said. The annual rainy season, which arrived in the second half of June, has hit southern Hunan province the most. Weather forecasters predict the relentless downpours could start to ease in coming days. Xiangjiang, a major tributary of the Yangtze river, has exceeded its record flood level in the Hunan capital of Changsha. Floods in the city have swamped houses, uprooted trees, damaged cars and submerged roads.  Across Hunan, the flooding has forced hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate, damaged crops and destroyed houses, causing a total direct economic loss of 8.26 billion yuan ($1.22 billion), the provincial civil affairs office said.  In Guangxi, 16 people have been confirmed dead and 10 are missing after a flood hit the southwestern region after a storm, the official Xinhua news agency cited authorities as saying. Southern provinces produce some of China's major crops. Guangxi is China's top sugarcane-growing region, while Hunan is its third-largest hog-farming province. Rice is grown south of the Yangtze. Rescuers evacuate people by boat during a flood in Xinshao county, Hunan province.StringerChina will take steps to ensure sugar reserves are safe during the rainy season, the Sugar Reserve Management Centre said. China Southern Power Grid reported an extensive blackout in Guangxi. Electricity to half of the affected area was restored by Monday morning. The state post bureau warned of courier delays in parts of the central, southern and southwestern provinces. Slideshow (14 Images)By contrast, stifling heat has settled over Beijing, Hebei, Henan and other northern provinces since last week, with temperatures forecast to reach 40 degrees Celsius in some areas on Monday, the meteorological bureau said. Cities in Shaanxi province issued alerts, saying temperatures could exceed 35C in coming three days. Many residents in the province have ordered food to be delivered rather than cook at home in the heat, a Shaanxi newspaper reported. In Beijing, many residents stayed indoors over the weekend due to the heat. In the Inner Mongolia region, more than 200 firefighters are battling a grassland fire that has crossed over to northern China from Mongolia, Xinhua reported. The blaze has spread quickly in the heat, dry conditions and strong winds.  The heat wave is expected to ease by mid-week.

Nets can confirm that it has been approached and is reviewing its options. However, it is very early stage and there can be no certainty as to the potential outcome,  the company said in a statement on Saturday. Shares in Nets jumped as much as 14 percent on Monday following the statement which came after Bloomberg reported that potential buyers, including U.S. private equity firm Hellman & Friedman LLC, were interested.   We believe interest from pure acquiring companies is less likely. The U.S. payment schemes (Visa & Mastercard) are clearly large enough to be able to acquire a company the size of Nets,  Morgan Stanley analysts write in a research note. Nordea Equity Research analyst Oliver Schüler Pisani said Visa and Mastercard could be potential bidders for Nets, the issuer of the most used debit card in Denmark, Dankort. Analysts said Nets's valuation was attractive. It trades at a discount to both the sector and its closest rival, Worldplay (WPG.L), leaving room for a good takeover premium, Pisani said.

The People's Bank of China switched to a modest tightening stance at the start of this year to help cool explosive growth in debt, but it injected substantial liquidity last month to avoid a quarter-end cash crunch, market participants said.

The border stand-off on a plateau next to the mountainous Indian state of Sikkim, which borders China, has ratcheted up tension between the neighboring giants, who share a 3,500 km (2,175 miles) frontier, large parts of which are disputed. According to the Chinese interpretation of events, Indian guards crossed into China's Donglang region early in June and obstructed work on a road on the plateau. Troops from the two sides then confronted each other close to a strategic valley controlled by China that separates India from Bhutan - a close Indian ally - and gives China access to the so-called Chicken's Neck, a thin strip of land that connects India to its remote northeastern regions. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing that the Sikkim part of the border had been settled in the 1890 agreement, and previous Indian governments had many times affirmed that in writing.  Pacts must be respected - this is a basic principle of international law,  Geng said. Indian troops crossing onto the Chinese side were a violation of this historical agreement and the United Nations charter, he added.  The nature of this is very serious,  Geng said, reiterating a demand for India to withdraw its troops to its side. India's Ministry of External Affairs referred to a statement it made on Friday, when it warned China that construction of the road near their common border would have serious security implications. Analysts in New Delhi said that India had intervened on behalf of Bhutan. As the tiny Himalayan Kingdom was not party to the 1890 agreement between Britain and China, the dispute was between China and Bhutan over where their common border lies. Bhutan said last week that the road was being built inside its territory. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are attending a summit of the G20 group of nations in the German city of Hamburg later this week. Geng would not be drawn on whether the two could meet there, saying bilateral meetings for Xi at the summit were being arranged.

It’s still frustrating to ponder what might have been had things played out differently,  Mallya said in a preview for Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix in Spielberg, the race following on from Baku.  Since Baku we’ve had some conversations internally and reminded our drivers that the team must always come first. It’s never acceptable for team mates to make contact with each other and it certainly cost us points in Baku,  added Mallya.  However, the events of Azerbaijan won’t change our approach. Our drivers can race freely and I’m sure they have learned some valuable lessons ... I know they are mature enough to work together for the good of the team.  Force India, currently fourth overall in the constructors' championship, have yet to win a race since Mallya arrived in 2008 and renamed a team that had gone through various previous guises as Jordan, Midland and Spyker.

But without us causing the red flag, Hamilton’s headrest wouldn’t have come up, so he would have won it. So, would have, could have, should have ... we still would have been second or third.

Sterling, which jumped last week on expectations of a BoE shift towards higher borrowing costs, fell after the Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) slipped to 54.3 from a downwardly revised 56.3 in May, a three-month low. The reading was below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a reading of 56.5. It also contrasted with a sharp pick-up in growth for factories in the euro zone. Britain's economy barely grew in the first three months of the year, with consumers facing the double hit of accelerating inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, and slowing wage growth. Some BoE officials say the consumer drag on the economy is likely to be offset by higher exports and investment and two of the sitting eight monetary policymakers voted last month for a rate hike. A third supporter of a hike has since left the BoE.  However, Monday's survey suggested the supposed silver lining of a weak currency - more competitive exports - is proving elusive, even as the global economy picks up. The PMI showed export orders rose last month at the weakest pace since January.  While the survey data add to signs that the economy is likely to have shown stronger growth in the second quarter, further doubts are raised as to whether this performance can be sustained into the second half of the year,  said Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit.  Export orders remained disappointingly lackluster despite the ongoing competitiveness boost of the weak sterling exchange rate.  The EEF, a lobby group representing manufacturers, said the sector would probably provide a counterweight to a slowing in Britain's far bigger services sector, but employers were wary about the political outlook after Prime Minister Theresa May was left weakened by last month's inconclusive election outcome.  The build-up in political uncertainty looks to be dampening sentiment in the sector somewhat,  George Nikolaidis, an EEF economist, said. An Institute of Directors survey published in June showed business confidence fell sharply after May lost her parliamentary majority the election. Monday's PMI showed price pressures for manufacturing firms eased in June, which could help ease the squeeze on profit margins. However, optimism sank to an seven-month low.Among investment goods manufacturers, who are critical to the recovery in investment expected by the BoE, optimism fell to its lowest level since last July.

But such an arrangement would fly in the face of Toshiba's assertions that its South Korean rival will have no equity or management influence in the $18 billion chip unit - a stance it has taken to satisfy a government that wants the business to remain under domestic control and for key technology to be kept out of the hands of foreign rivals. The potential for SK Hynix to hold equity would also only harden already trenchant opposition from Western Digital (WDC.O), Toshiba's chip business partner, which is claiming breach of contract and seeking to an injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent. The South Korean chipmaker is part of a Japan government-led consortium that also includes Bain Capital and which was hastily cobbled together last month by Japan's trade ministry. While it has the government's implicit stamp of approval, the unusual structure of the offer has raised questions over whether can feasibly clinch a deal.  New details coming out through the media such as the convertible bonds suggest there may be some flaws in the scheme. Toshiba must now explain its exact structure,  said Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.  Reaching a deal is now looking difficult,  he added.  Sources familiar with the matter have said a state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), would hold the biggest equity interest despite putting up only 300 billion yen ($2.7 billion) of the planned 2 trillion yen. Bain plans to put up 850 billion yen - half of that amount to be provided by SK Hynix in the form of financing, the sources have said.    The South Korean chipmaker plans to buy convertible debt in a special purpose company being created by Bain for the Toshiba acquisition, said one of the sources who spoke on Monday, adding that terms were still being negotiated. SK Hynix was unlikely to convert the debt into equity in the near term, the source said.  SK Hynix declined to comment while representatives for Bain could not be immediately reached for comment. A Toshiba spokesman said the company cannot comment on the specifics of the deal. The sources declined to be identified as the talks were confidential. Toshiba is scrambling to get a deal done as fast as possible as it needs funds to cover billions in cost overruns at now-bankrupt unit Westinghouse. But last week, the Japanese conglomerate missed a self-imposed deadline of having a signed agreement for the chip business in hand, saying more time was needed to smooth out opinions between members of the preferred bidder consortium. Officials within Toshiba's board and INCJ are also concerned about the potential for technology leaks and are demanding the final contract specify that the South Korean firm's financing will never be translated into equity, separate sources have said. SK Hynix has only briefly explained its rationale for being part of the consortium, saying that it sees further business opportunities with Toshiba. It is relatively weak in NAND memory chips although it is the world's No. 2 maker of DRAM chips, which help electronic devices multitask. Toshiba said separately it had made a filing outlining its arguments to Western Digital's request for a preliminary injunction to block the sale of the chip business sale. A hearing on the issue is scheduled for July 14 and Western Digital has said it believes a decision will come on the same day.

The United Arab Emirates' second busiest commercial airport expects to handle  around 25 million  passengers in 2017 compared with 24.5 million in the previous year, Abdul Majeed al-Khoori told Reuters by phone. That would represent growth of around 2 percent compared with 5.1 percent in 2016.  This has been a tough year for aviation globally but for the region as well,  an Abu Dhabi Airports spokeswoman said.  We have seen some slowdown in the growth of the airlines that use Abu Dhabi Airport, we also have the regional political situation, these factors are all playing into the slightly slower growth.  The pace of growth at rapidly expanding Middle Eastern airlines has slowed this year against a more challenging economic backdrop. Travel restrictions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and political crisis in the Gulf have added to the pressure. Etihad Airways, the main carrier at Abu Dhabi International, is pursuing a strategy review and recruiting for a new group chief executive to succeed veteran boss James Hogan who left the airline on July 1. On Sunday, the United States lifted restrictions on laptops for flights from Abu Dhabi. However, flights between Abu Dhabu and Doha have been suspended since last month after the UAE and three other Arab countries cut diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar. Abu Dhabi International handled 10.1 million passengers in the five months to May 31, an increase of 1.8 percent compared with the same period a year ago The UAE's busiest airport is Emirates hub Dubai International Airport, which is also the world's busiest for international travellers. Dubai International handled 36.97 million passengers in the first five months of 2017, a 6.7 percent increase on the same period last year.

Yet the action is really happening on a balmy night in Marrakech. It sounds like science fiction yet sports marketing guru Patrick Nally says that, with technology advancing, it will soon be reality. Nally, widely credited with creating the global cash cow the sport has become, says that soccer's governing body FIFA needs to react and radically alter what he says is as an outdated World Cup hosting model. The World Cup has always been hosted in a single country over a month-long period, except in 2002 when it was shared between Japan and South Korea. Hundreds of thousands of fans flock to the host nation, turning it into a logistical nightmare, although more watch matches on huge open air screens at so-called  fan fests  than in the stadiums themselves. Like many critics, Nally says the bidding process is open to horse-trading - as laid bare by the so-called Garcia report published by FIFA last week into race to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, won by Russia and Qatar respectively. Nally said that, despite changes to the bidding process which will now allow FIFA's 211-member Congress to choose the hosts rather than the executive committee, the system was still far from perfect.  One assumes that national federations who will bid in the future will be looking at all sorts of ways to influence the outcome,  he said.  I don't think the culture could be changed overnight.   Who's World Cup is this? It's the fans' World Cup, it's not FIFA's World Cup,  he added.  Technology allows the event to be staged very differently way, in a far less politically manipulated way.  Nally said the key would be new technology which would allow holographic images of matches to be beamed into stadiums around the world.  If I am in Wembley, I will be looking at the Wembley pitch and I will be seeing live what is going on at a pitch somewhere else in the world,  he said.  Technology reproduces it in such a way, you would not know that it's not before your very eyes.   You can show every game in stadiums in every one of FIFA's 211 member nations. You don't necessarily need to put the World Cup all in one country.  Nally, who brokered FIFA's first major sponsorship deal -- with Coca Cola -- ahead of the 1978 World Cup, worked as a consultant on Japan's bid to host the 2022 World Cup which included a proposal to broadcast holographic images of matches live to 400 stadiums around the world. He now believes matches can be played around the globe, provided they are co-ordinated so that teams did not have to travel thousands of kilometers across time zones between games. His proposal is similar to Euro 2020 which will be played in 13 cities across the continent although European soccer's governing body UEFA has said it will be a one-off.  (Euro 2020) is going to be an interesting experiment because,  said Nally, who has long since disassociated himself from FIFA.  It's a small step in the direction I'm proposing  Nally said he would like fans and players to be given a say in choosing hosts cities - though he admitted it was a long shot.  It would be nice to think they could but I don't know the structure that would allow them to do this,  he said.  The only way it could be done is through national associations -- and they don't necessarily listen to their fans.

Chinese visitors to South Korea fell 64 percent in May from a year earlier, declining for a third consecutive month after Beijing stopped travel agencies selling trips to its neighbour following Seoul's decision to deploy a U.S. missile defence. China objected to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, saying its radar could penetrate Chinese territory and undermine regional security. Hanwha Galleria Timeworld Co Ltd will close its money-losing store in Jeju airport on Aug. 31, just four years after it opened to tap then-strong demand from Chinese tourists. The closure comes after store revenue tumbled 80 percent in April-May from the same period a year earlier, spokesman Min Kyung-kook said.  The sales suspension is expected to decrease revenue, but to have a positive impact on improving profitability,  the company said in a stock-exchange filing. South Korea overtook Britain in 2010 to become the world's biggest duty free market, but the diplomatic spat and rising competition have hit the industry hard. An official at the Korea Customs Service said the closure came only three months after Hyundai Paint Co Ltd's Duty Free One closed in Busan Port International Passenger Terminal. Last month, market leader Lotte Duty Free said 40 senior officials have offered to return 10 percent of annual pay to cut costs, expecting a  prolonged crisis .

Sterling, which jumped last week on expectations of a BoE shift towards higher borrowing costs, fell after the Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) slipped to 54.3 from a downwardly revised 56.3 in May, a three-month low. The reading was below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a reading of 56.5. It also contrasted with a sharp pick-up in growth for factories in the euro zone. Britain's economy barely grew in the first three months of the year, with consumers facing the double hit of accelerating inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, and slowing wage growth. Some BoE officials say the consumer drag on the economy is likely to be offset by higher exports and investment and two of the sitting eight monetary policymakers voted last month for a rate hike. A third supporter of a hike has since left the BoE.  However, Monday's survey suggested the supposed silver lining of a weak currency - more competitive exports - is proving elusive, even as the global economy picks up. The PMI showed export orders rose last month at the weakest pace since January.  While the survey data add to signs that the economy is likely to have shown stronger growth in the second quarter, further doubts are raised as to whether this performance can be sustained into the second half of the year,  said Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit.  Export orders remained disappointingly lackluster despite the ongoing competitiveness boost of the weak sterling exchange rate.  The EEF, a lobby group representing manufacturers, said the sector would probably provide a counterweight to a slowing in Britain's far bigger services sector, but employers were wary about the political outlook after Prime Minister Theresa May was left weakened by last month's inconclusive election outcome.  The build-up in political uncertainty looks to be dampening sentiment in the sector somewhat,  George Nikolaidis, an EEF economist, said. An Institute of Directors survey published in June showed business confidence fell sharply after May lost her parliamentary majority the election. Monday's PMI showed price pressures for manufacturing firms eased in June, which could help ease the squeeze on profit margins. However, optimism sank to an seven-month low.Among investment goods manufacturers, who are critical to the recovery in investment expected by the BoE, optimism fell to its lowest level since last July.

The dismal showing for Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Sunday's Tokyo Metropolitan assembly election was a stinging rebuke for his 4-1/2-year-old administration, although on the surface it was a referendum on popular Governor Yuriko Koike's year in office. Koike's novice Tokyo Citizens First party and its allies, including the LDP's national-level coalition partner, the Komeito, took 79 seats in the 127-member chamber. The LDP won a mere 23 seats, less than half its pre-election total and its worst-ever result in a Tokyo poll.   I want to regain the people's trust by unifying the party and ... showing results,  Abe told reporters.   It was a severe judgment suggesting (voters) thought the Abe administration was getting slack,  Abe said.  We must accept this firmly and seriously and make every effort to return to our original aspirations of when we regained power.  Past Tokyo elections have been bellwethers for national trends. A 2009 Tokyo poll in which the LDP won just 38 seats was followed by its defeat in a general election that year, although this time no lower house poll need be held until late 2018. Koike, a media-savvy ex-defense minister and former LDP member, took office a year ago as the first female governor in the capital, defying the local LDP chapter to run and promising to reform governance of a megacity with a population of 13.7 million and an economy bigger than the Netherlands'. The LDP has been hit by a scandal over suspicions - denied by the premier - that Abe helped a friend's business get favored treatment. It has also been hurt by cabinet minister gaffes, and by a perception among many voters that Abe's administration has grown arrogant after more than four years in power. Black Eye for Abe The huge victory for Koike's party and its allies has sparked fresh speculation that she will take her party national, but any bid by Koike herself for the country's top job looks unlikely until after the Tokyo 2020 Olympics - if her popularity remains high and her party proves it is able to govern.   This was less a vote for 'Tomin First' (Tokyo Citizens First) than a repudiation of Abe,  said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asia studies at Temple University's Japan campus.  It was not a grass roots firestorm.   Abe's support rate, which tumbled in surveys last month,  slipped again to 38 percent from 41 percent in an Asahi newspaper poll conducted at the weekend. That was lower than the 42 percent who did not back his cabinet. Abe will likely reshuffle his Cabinet to try to repair his battered image, although the tactic has backfired in the past when new ministers became involved in scandals or committed gaffes.   The good scenario for the economy and markets is that the Tokyo Assembly election result triggers a pro-reform Cabinet reshuffle, and returns focus to economic issues,  wrote Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities' economist Robert Feldman.  The bad scenario is the LDP becomes paralyzed, and few reform actions are taken,  he said. The LDP's poor result could also boost Abe's inclination to delay yet again an unpopular rise in the national sales tax to 10 percent scheduled for 2019. A decision needs to be made around the middle of next year. It could also affect his push to revise the pacifist Article 9 of the post-war, U.S.-drafted constitution, a politically divisive goal that Abe said in May he wanted to achieve by 2020.  I don't think that will go as planned,  said Atsuo Ito, an independent political analyst and author. Abe had been considered on track for a third three-year term when his tenure as LDP president ends in September 2018, but his sliding ratings and the election loss have clouded that outlook.    A lot can happen between now and 2018. Two months ago, it looked like he'd waltz to a third term. Now it's uncertain,  Kingston said.

The integrated petrochemical producer, part of South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group, said it reduced its public shares on offer by a fifth to 580 million shares from the initially planned 740.5 million. It also lowered the IPO price range to 6.50 ringgit-8.00 ringgit per share, according to sources, compared to the earlier expected 7.60-8.00 ringgit range. Despite the reduction, Lotte Chemical Titan's IPO is set to be Malaysia's biggest since 2012, estimated to raise between $877.7 million and $1.1 billion. The company was to have priced the offer last week but relaunched it for a day on Monday to institutional investors, which constitutes the bulk of the IPO, as lagging investor interest resulted in an undersubscribed book. Lotte Chemical said in a statement that  after taking into account the overall demand through price discovery, the company... decided to reduce the offering size for the institutional offering.  Two sources said that the IPO's retail portion, which closed last week, was around one-third undersubscribed. A Hong Kong-based banker close to the deal said retail interest for the IPO was weak as investors deemed the offer pricey. Lotte Chemical did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. Appetite for IPOs in Malaysia had dwindled on the back of a weak currency, volatile commodities markets and a government-linked corruption scandal. The market saw some revival earlier this year with the listings of Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd and Eco World International Bhd . The success of Lotte's listing is critical for other firms that are considering IPOs after holding off for years due to poor market conditions. The launch of large IPOs this year is seen as a sign that confidence has returned to the market, but some are questioning if the positive sentiment is overestimated. Lotte Chemical Titan originally planned the IPO for last year but postponed it after South Korea began investigating Lotte Group for alleged wrongdoing. Other deals reportedly in the pipeline in Malaysia include fast food operator QSR Brands looking to raise about $500 million and Edra Energy targeting $500 million to $1 billion. Lotte's relaunched offer is open until 2200 local time on Monday. The final pricing of the IPO is expected on Tuesday, and listing is scheduled for July 11.  The book is now in a much better position at the 6.50 ringgit offer. There are anchor orders that more than cover the institutional deal size, inclusive of the greenshoe option,  said the banker, who declined to be named as the process was private. The IPO drew Permodalan Nasional, Eastspring Investments, Great Eastern Life Assurance Malaysia, Maybank Asset Management and Maybank Islamic Asset Management to sign on as cornerstone investors. Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and Maybank are joint global coordinators for the IPO. Bookrunners are CIMB, HSBC and Nomura.

Czech, Hungarian and Polish purchasing managers' indices were well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, though the figures from Prague and Warsaw were a bit lower than expected.      As long as the industry of Germany remains strong, our region will not have any problem either,  said Peter Virovacz, analyst of ING in Budapest.     Analysts said growth in the European Union, which Central Europe outperforms, could continue to underpin most regional currencies.      The leu firmed slightly with investors expecting Romania's central bank, meeting on Monday, to keep record low interest rates on hold.     The only monetary authority in the region that has signalled that monetary tightening may be near after many years of loose policy, is the Czech central bank (CNB).     The Czech crown, trading at 26.089 against the euro, touched its strongest level since the CNB three months ago removed a cap that had kept the currency weaker than 27 for three and a half years.     The crown retreated to 26.109 by 0834 GMT.     It could continue to strengthen to 26 or even beyond, boosted by investors who sold tens of billions of euros to the CNB before the exit from the cap, betting on a crown surge, one Prague-based dealer said.      It has been continuous march towards 26, the question is, where the long-term short-betters have their target value,  the dealer said.      We have two kinds of shorts now, the long-term ones, where the level is not known - there are massive volumes there - and the short-term ones, where the target level is 26,  the dealer added.      The forint touched two-week highs against the euro and traded at 308.77 at 0834 GMT.      The Polish zloty eased a shade to 4.2335, but remained up from Friday's lows.     The Polish central bank is expected to keep rates on hold on Wednesday, raise its economic growth forecasts and cut its inflation projections, Erste analyst said in a note.     Despite Romania's robust economic growth, the leu may remain under pressure due to worries over the budget and market impact of tax policies under new Prime Minister Mihai Tudose.     The government plans to ditch a flat 16 percent tax on income and profit.     The plans knocked down Bucharest's main stock index to four-month lows last week. The index regained some ground on Monday, rising 0.6 percent.

Money fund providers are faced with the costs and challenges of developing new products, or amending existing ones, to comply with the reforms, while corporate treasurers and other short-term investors are determining which best meet their needs. Managers currently offering constant net asset value (CNAV) funds are largely focused on the new Low Volatility Net Asset Value (LVNAV) fund type, but investor appetite for this new product is by definition untested. Providers unable to absorb the added costs of new products and investor education, or unable to differentiate themselves could look to exit the business, leading to more consolidation. The industry has already been consolidating for some years, with more recent consolidation in the US in relation to US money fund reform. The timing of product launches and conversions may become an important competitive dynamic, as will effective investor outreach and education. Achieving efficient and early regulatory approval may provide an advantage, as funds are concentrated in just a handful of jurisdictions, creating the risk of approval delays and backlogs. But any advantage will depend on whether investors understand the new products and are willing to make the switch early, or will want to wait. If the US experience with money fund reform is a guide, investors may wait as long as possible before exercising their option to move monies. The reforms will become effective in 20 days. This will trigger an implementation period, with new funds required to comply with the reforms by 21 July 2018 and existing funds by 21 January 2019.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.

(Reuters) - The threat posed by North Korea was a key topic in phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of China and Japan, along with trade issues, the White House said on Sunday. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ahead of expected meetings with the leaders of Asia's two biggest economies at a Group of 20 nations summit in Germany later this week.       Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula,  the White House said of Trump's call with Xi from his resort property in Bridgewater, New Jersey, where he is spending a long weekend.  President Trump reiterated his determination to seek more balanced trade relations with America’s trading partners,  it added. Trump has become increasingly frustrated with China's inability to rein in North Korea, and the reference to trade was an indication the one-time New York businessman may be ready to return to his tougher-talking ways on business with Beijing after holding back in hopes it would put more pressure on Pyongyang. Trump and Xi discussed the  peace and stability of the Korean peninsula , China's Foreign Ministry said, without elaborating. Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang later told a daily briefing that the United States was  very clear  about China's position on North Korea. Geng did not elaborate on what Xi told Trump about North Korea. Related CoverageSouth Korea's Moon says North Korea has chance to talk Negative factors  have affected Sino-U.S. relations, and China has already expressed its position to the United States, Xi told Trump, according to a read-out of a telephone call between the leaders carried by the ministry. One China Policy The ministry said Trump told Xi the U.S. government would continue to follow a  one China  policy, under which Washington acknowledges the Chinese position that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it, and that this position had not changed. China pays great attention to that reiteration and hopes the United States can  appropriately handle  the Taiwan issue, Xi told Trump, according to the ministry.  FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping chat as they walk along the front patio of the Mar-a-Lago estate after a bilateral meeting in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., April 7, 2017.Carlos BarriaOn Thursday, the United States targeted a Chinese bank and sanctioned Chinese individuals and a firm for dealing with North Korea and approved a $1.42 billion arms deal with Taiwan - decisions that angered Beijing. And on Sunday a U.S. warship sailed near a disputed island in the South China Sea claimed by China, drawing a rebuke from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Trump’s separate conversations with the two Asian leaders followed White House talks with South Korea’s new president, Moon Jae-in, last week in which the U.S. leader called on Asian powers to implement sanctions and demand North Korea  choose a better path and do it quickly.      Trilateral Summit FILE PHOTO: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (L) looks on as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a joint press conference at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 10, 2017.Jim BourgTrump and Abe, in their call, reiterated their commitment to increase pressure on North Korea.  They reaffirmed that the United States-Japan Alliance stands ready to defend and respond to any threat or action taken by North Korea,  the White House said in a statement.  Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference the two countries and South Korea will have a trilateral summit at the G20 meeting, but he didn’t want to speculate on what might be said there.  “It’s important for these three nations to show their strong unity and cooperation both within and without,  Suga said.   Things such as strengthening pressure on North Korea or urging China to fulfill even more of a role. Things like this have been agreed on before as well.”   Trump, who held talks with Abe earlier this year at the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, has forged a united front with the Japanese leader on the need to exert pressure on North Korea to curb its nuclear and missile development.  During and after a Florida summit with Xi in April at Mar-a-Lago, Trump praised his Chinese counterpart for agreeing to work on the North Korea issue and has held back on attacking Chinese trade practices he railed against during the presidential campaign. But Trump has recently suggested he was running out of patience with China's modest steps to pressure North Korea, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States, and has been considering moving ahead on trade actions. Trump has been weighing new quotas or tariffs on steel imports for national security reasons and plans to discuss his concerns at the G20. Washington sees excess global production capacity, particularly in China, administration officials say.

The undisclosed factor put in place by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to reduce price swings has been at play only on days when the yuan's previous session close was weaker than intended. The central bank introduced the  counter-cyclical factor  into its formula that determines the mid-point reference rate for the yuan in late May saying it would allow the currency's value to better reflect supply and demand. That secretive factor has made it almost impossible for the market to estimate each day's mid-point, around which the yuan is allowed to trade. Investors suspect the new formula is aimed at keeping the yuan stable, in particular to prevent it weakening excessively and to change market expectations around its depreciation. Mid-point fixings in June appear to support their theory.       The counter-cyclical factor was triggered to support the midpoint, when the previous day's close was weaker than the fixing, suggesting that the depreciation pressure was building up in the market,  said Ken Cheung, Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. Market watchers who have built models to mimic the PBOC's formula suspect the factor was not included in daily midpoint fixings between Wednesday and Friday last week, when the dollar was weak across currencies and the yuan ended the local session each day stronger than the fixing the previous day.     The introduction of the counter-cyclical factor has allowed the central bank to regain its price right on the midpoint,  said Cheung, noting the authorities now have more power to use the midpoint to guide the same day's yuan movement. Analysts say yuan policy is less transparent but the change was probably implemented to remove deeply entrenched expectations the currency is a one-way bet down. The renminbi fell 6.5 percent against the dollar last year and domestic outflows remain heavy despite capital controls. June Swings The  counter-cyclical factor  worked well to alter bearish perceptions of the yuan in the first two weeks after the change as the currency was kept largely stable. A slew of investors who had bet on losses in the yuan liquidated their short positions.      The adoption of the counter-cyclical factor has strengthened the idea that the yuan would start to strengthen,  said a senior trader at a Chinese bank in Shanghai.    The yuan fixing strengthened 1 percent against the dollar between May 31 and June 9, helping nudge the currency up 0.8 percent even though the dollar was largely flat in the same period.      June has traditionally been a period of high corporate dollar demand in China, and rising dollar purchases subsequently forced the yuan to give back more than half of the gains it made in late May and early June. The yuan's local close was persistently weaker than its fixing between June 15 and June 26.  The old model for the fixing was based on the yuan's local close, along with moves of the U.S. dollar against currencies of China's main trading partners. That meant that during periods of yuan weakness, the PBOC was forced to fix a weaker guidance the following day, traders said.  The  counter-cyclical factor  has changed that. On average, every 1 pip intraday weakening in the onshore yuan spot rate would lead to about a 0.7 pip strengthening in the fixing relative to what is implied by CFETS model, Goldman Sachs said in a note this week.       While the counter-cyclical factor can be used to transmit policy guidance, for credibility it may need to be coupled with occasional meaningful yuan moves driven by actual FX intervention,  economists at Goldman Sachs said.     That too has been taking place. Multiple traders told Reuters last week that they saw Chinese state-owned banks selling dollars in the market, in an apparent attempt to keep the yuan from declining.

Etihad welcomed the decision on Sunday and credited a facility at Abu Dhabi International Airport where passengers clear U.S. immigration before they land in the United States for  superior security advantages  that had allowed it to satisfy U.S. requirements. Transportation Security Administration officials have checked that the measures had been implemented correctly, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). U.S. officials assessed the airport on Saturday night, Abdul Majeed al-Khoori, acting chief executive of operator Abu Dhabi Airports told Reuters on Monday. The disruption to passengers from the new measures will be  very minimal  with the processing time for those traveling to the United States unchanged, he said by phone. Etihad is the only airline that operates direct flights from Abu Dhabi to the United States.    In March the United States banned laptops in cabins on flights to the United States originating at 10 airports in eight countries - Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey - to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. FILE PHOTO - An illustration picture shows a laptop on the screen of an X-ray security scanner, April 7, 2017.Srdjan Zivulovic/Illustration/File PhotoBritain quickly followed suit with a similar set of restrictions. Last week the United States unveiled security measures for flights to the country designed to prevent the expansion of the ban to more countries that could cause major logistical problems and deter travel. DHS spokesman David Lapan said in a statement provided to Reuters that Ethiad's efforts to implement extra security measures were a model for foreign and domestic airlines. Other airports and airlines in the region, such as Emirates and Qatar Airways, remain under the restrictions, he said.  We look forward to working with other airlines to ensure implementation of these critical measures as quickly as possible,  said Lapan. Dubai Airports, the operator of Emirates hub Dubai International Airport, said on Monday it had offered its  full cooperation ...  to satisfy the U.S. directive as quickly as possible.   Etihad operates 45 flights a week between Abu Dhabi and the United States, the company said. Emirates, the Middle East's largest airline and a rival to Etihad, said in April it was cutting flights on five U.S. routes because of reduced demand after a travel ban imposed by President Donald Trump and the laptop ban.

China's manufacturing sector expanded at the fastest pace in three months while South Korea's grew for the first time in 11 months. In emerging Europe, Turkish manufacturing activity expanded at its quickest in more than three-and-a-half years , whilst Poland and Russia also continued to accelerate. Oil prices also rose, inching up to a two-week high.  Data flow from the PMIs have been quite solid,  Manik Narain, emerging FX strategist at UBS, said, referring to Purchasing Managers Indexes.  Between the commodities and the tech cycle, emerging market equities have held up quite well.  MSCI's benchmark emerging stocks index rose 0.2 percent, with Polish and Turkish stocks up 0.3 percent, while Russian stocks <.MCX rose 0.8 percent, helped by higher oil prices. Chinese mainland shares delivered a mixed performance but Hong Kong was supported by financials, the biggest beneficiary of a new Bond Connect scheme that links China's $9 trillion bond market with overseas investors. Indian stocks rose almost 1 percent  after tobacco manufacturer ITC jumped nearly 10 percent to a record high. Taxation for cigarettes under a new goods and services levy is around 5-6 percent lower than under the previous structure. With the dollar firming 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies and U.S. 10-year yields at six-week highs, emerging currencies struggled to make headway, with the South Korean won weakening 0.2 percent and the Indian rupee down 0.3 percent. South Africa's rand slipped 0.4 percent, extending losses to a third straight session. A no-confidence vote in President Jacob Zuma has been delayed to Aug 8. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said he would present an action plan on Friday to boost economic growth, drawing on issues raised by investors and ratings agencies. The lira fell 0.2 percent after Turkish consumer inflation dipped in June.  The sharper-than-expected fall in Turkish inflation last month to 10.9 percent year-on-year raises the risk that the central bank will begin to reverse its recent tightening cycle sooner than we had previously anticipated,  analysts at Capital Economics said in a note. The Czech crown firmed to its strongest against the euro since the central bank abandoned its weak crown policy in early April. Czech employment growth accelerated to its strongest since March. Qatari assets steadied after Saudi Arabia and its allies gave Doha two more days to comply with a list of demands in an ongoing diplomatic crisis. Qatari stocks rose 0.3 percent after dipping to the lowest since January 2016 on Sunday. Its five-year credit default swaps were quoted at 121 basis points (bps) by IHS Markit, after touching 123 bps on Friday, a 16-month high.

The militants detonated another explosive device in the Caldiran district of Van province, wounding two village guards, officials said. They said one of the wounded guards had died in the hospital following the attack. Separately, PKK militants attacked workers carrying out roadside work on a road for a military base in the Uludere district of the southeastern province of Sirnak, killing two workers and wounding another five, security sources said. The militants carried out another attack on a worksite in Sirnak, killing one worker, the local governor's office said in a statement. It said three PKK militants had been killed in a subsequent operation in the region. Turkish security forces have killed 55 PKK militants in eastern Turkey in the last week, interior ministry data showed on Monday. Another 11 militants surrendered and four were capture alive, the ministry said. Over the weekend, PKK militants shot and killed two officials from the ruling AK Party in southeast Turkey, authorities said. The PKK took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984 and more than 40,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed in the conflict. It is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union. A ceasefire between the Turkish state and the militants broke down in July 2015 and the southeast subsequently saw some of the worst violence since the insurgency began.

The yuan fixing strengthened 1 percent against the dollar between May 31 and June 9, helping nudge the currency up 0.8 percent even though the dollar was largely flat in the same period.      June has traditionally been a period of high corporate dollar demand in China, and rising dollar purchases subsequently forced the yuan to give back more than half of the gains it made in late May and early June. The yuan's local close was persistently weaker than its fixing between June 15 and June 26.  The old model for the fixing was based on the yuan's local close, along with moves of the U.S. dollar against currencies of China's main trading partners. That meant that during periods of yuan weakness, the PBOC was forced to fix a weaker guidance the following day, traders said.  The  counter-cyclical factor  has changed that. On average, every 1 pip intraday weakening in the onshore yuan spot rate would lead to about a 0.7 pip strengthening in the fixing relative to what is implied by CFETS model, Goldman Sachs said in a note this week.       While the counter-cyclical factor can be used to transmit policy guidance, for credibility it may need to be coupled with occasional meaningful yuan moves driven by actual FX intervention,  economists at Goldman Sachs said.     That too has been taking place. Multiple traders told Reuters last week that they saw Chinese state-owned banks selling dollars in the market, in an apparent attempt to keep the yuan from declining.

Etihad welcomed the decision on Sunday and credited a facility at Abu Dhabi International Airport where passengers clear U.S. immigration before they land in the United States for  superior security advantages  that had allowed it to satisfy U.S. requirements. Transportation Security Administration officials have checked that the measures had been implemented correctly, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). U.S. officials assessed the airport on Saturday night, Abdul Majeed al-Khoori, acting chief executive of operator Abu Dhabi Airports told Reuters on Monday. The disruption to passengers from the new measures will be  very minimal  with the processing time for those traveling to the United States unchanged, he said by phone. Etihad is the only airline that operates direct flights from Abu Dhabi to the United States.    In March the United States banned laptops in cabins on flights to the United States originating at 10 airports in eight countries - Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey - to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft.

Last week the United States unveiled security measures for flights to the country designed to prevent the expansion of the ban to more countries that could cause major logistical problems and deter travel. DHS spokesman David Lapan said in a statement provided to Reuters that Ethiad's efforts to implement extra security measures were a model for foreign and domestic airlines. Other airports and airlines in the region, such as Emirates and Qatar Airways, remain under the restrictions, he said.  We look forward to working with other airlines to ensure implementation of these critical measures as quickly as possible,  said Lapan. Dubai Airports, the operator of Emirates hub Dubai International Airport, said on Monday it had offered its  full cooperation ...  to satisfy the U.S. directive as quickly as possible.   Etihad operates 45 flights a week between Abu Dhabi and the United States, the company said. Emirates, the Middle East's largest airline and a rival to Etihad, said in April it was cutting flights on five U.S. routes because of reduced demand after a travel ban imposed by President Donald Trump and the laptop ban.

Australia's federal government floated a special A$6.2 billion levy on the country's top four lenders plus investment bank Macquarie Group Ltd in May, capitalising on a sector that has benefited from a property boom just as it faces a backlash following a series of consumer business scandals. Banks were already vocal in their opposition to the federal tax when the country's fifth-biggest state said last month that it would impose its own special A$370 million ($284 million) levy over four years. If South Australia's conservative opposition blocks the measure in parliament, it will likely dissuade other state governments from following suit. Larger Western Australia has said it would consider copying the move based on how well it worked in South Australia.  This is a toxic tax on jobs in South Australia,  state opposition leader Steven Marshall told reporters.  We are going to block this tax, we are going to put the people of South Australia forward and we are going to create jobs.  Marshall's party holds just eight of the state parliament's 22 upper house seats, but he said his party had the support of three independent policymakers who have already said they would reject the levy. One MP, as speaker, would not be able to participate in any vote on the matter. The state government has said it would invest the extra revenue and create jobs, and on Monday treasurer Tom Koutsantonis said the government was  sticking to its guns .  The government is committed to passing this budget, it has a right to pass its budget,  Koutsantonis told reporters. The Australian Bankers' Association, which represents all the lenders affected by the taxes - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and Macquarie - welcomed the opposition's decision.  The growing outcry from South Australians about this tax shows they understand it would have a serious impact on ordinary households and the cost of doing business in their state,  association Executive Director Tony Pearson said in a statement.

The undisclosed factor put in place by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to reduce price swings has been at play only on days when the yuan's previous session close was weaker than intended. The central bank introduced the  counter-cyclical factor  into its formula that determines the mid-point reference rate for the yuan in late May saying it would allow the currency's value to better reflect supply and demand. That secretive factor has made it almost impossible for the market to estimate each day's mid-point, around which the yuan is allowed to trade. Investors suspect the new formula is aimed at keeping the yuan stable, in particular to prevent it weakening excessively and to change market expectations around its depreciation. Mid-point fixings in June appear to support their theory.       The counter-cyclical factor was triggered to support the midpoint, when the previous day's close was weaker than the fixing, suggesting that the depreciation pressure was building up in the market,  said Ken Cheung, Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. Market watchers who have built models to mimic the PBOC's formula suspect the factor was not included in daily midpoint fixings between Wednesday and Friday last week, when the dollar was weak across currencies and the yuan ended the local session each day stronger than the fixing the previous day.     The introduction of the counter-cyclical factor has allowed the central bank to regain its price right on the midpoint,  said Cheung, noting the authorities now have more power to use the midpoint to guide the same day's yuan movement. Analysts say yuan policy is less transparent but the change was probably implemented to remove deeply entrenched expectations the currency is a one-way bet down. The renminbi fell 6.5 percent against the dollar last year and domestic outflows remain heavy despite capital controls. June Swings The  counter-cyclical factor  worked well to alter bearish perceptions of the yuan in the first two weeks after the change as the currency was kept largely stable. A slew of investors who had bet on losses in the yuan liquidated their short positions.

The Outlook is Stable. CDLHT is a Singapore-based trust that owns 19 hotels with more than 5,400 rooms after its latest acquisition in Germany is completed in July 2017, and one retail mall. Although the portfolio is tilted towards Singapore, the real estate investment trust (REIT) includes hotels in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Germany and the Maldives. CDLHT's rating is driven by the stability of cash flows stemming from its lease-based income, which includes a significant proportion of fixed rent, and its solid financing flexibility. KEY RATING DRIVERS Acquisitions Drive Cash Flows: CDLHT announced on 27 June that it has agreed to acquire an effective interest of 94.5% of the 337-room Pullman Hotel and its ancillary office and retail components in Munich, Germany, for SGD156.3 million. The trust expects to conclude the purchase in July. On 4 May, CDLHT bought The Lowry Hotel, a 165-room five-star property in Manchester UK for SGD94.7 million. Between 2013 and 2015, CDLHT spent a further SGD366 million to buy hotels in the UK, Japan, and the Maldives to diversify its portfolio geographically and increase its operating cash flows. Fitch estimates that CDLHT's EBITDA will rise to SGD134 million by end-2018 once the two new hotels contribute a full year's cash flows, from SGD123 million at end-2013. Lease Income, Fixed Rent: CDLHT's rating is supported by significant income from master-lease agreements with hotel operators, including significant minimum guaranteed rent. We expect fixed rent to reduce to 37% of revenue by end-2018 because of higher variable income from its new hotels, from 43% in 2015 and 40% in 2016. Furthermore, a significant portion of CDLHT's master-lease income is benchmarked to hotel revenue, which provides more income stability than if rent is benchmarked to profit. CDLHT's master leases typically have tenors of 15-20 years. Master leases amounting to 37% of CDLHT's 2016 rental income are due for renewal in the next three to four years, and include built-in renewal options for a further 15-20 years or more. CDLHT bought five properties through its business trust, out of the 14 it acquired since its IPO, where CDLHT is responsible for all operating costs of these hotels. In Fitch's opinion, the lower cash flow stability of this ownership method is mitigated by the increase in CDLHT's asset scale and geographic diversity. Improving Geographic Diversification: Fitch expects CDLHT's Singapore hotels to account for a lower share of its net property income (NPI) of around 55% in 2018, factoring in full years' income from the two new hotels purchased in 2017. The Singapore hotels accounted for 66% of CDLHT's NPI in 2015, and 62% in 2016. Operating conditions for the Singapore hotels have remained challenging in the last few years due to the high supply of new rooms even as demand faltered. We expect Singapore hotel earnings to bottom out in 2017 as the supply of new hotel rooms is due to fall sharply next year and visitor arrivals to Singapore remain healthy. Revenue per available room for the Singapore hotel sector stabilised in 1Q17 compared with 2016, supported by an increase in occupancy rates to 86% from an average of 84% over this period. Increased Rating Headroom: CDLHT's rating headroom will improve significantly following the expected completion of its SGD255 million rights issue in early August 2017. The trust's sponsor Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc has committed to take up its 37% share of the rights, and DBS Bank Ltd. (AA-/Stable) has underwritten the balance. CDLHT expects to utilise most of the proceeds to repay existing borrowings and reduce its loan-to-value ratio (LTV, defined as net debt/property assets). Solid Financial Flexibility: We expect CDLHT's LTV to reduce to 34% upon the successful completion of the rights issue and the purchase of the Pullman Hotel Munich, from our estimate of 39% as of end-June 2017. We expect CDLHT to maintain its LTV at around 40% or so in spite of any future acquisitions, which affords it some headroom under the regulatory threshold of 45%. This will mean that FFO fixed-charge cover should remain between 5.5x-6.0x, and FFO adjusted net leverage could hover between 6.5x and 7.0x. We expect CDLHT's properties to remain largely unencumbered, enabling it to maintain robust financing flexibility. The ratio of unencumbered assets/unsecured debt is likely to remain healthy at more than 2.0x in the next two years. DERIVATION SUMMARY CDLHT's rating is one notch lower than that of Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. (Host Inc, BBB/Stable). Host Inc. is a US-based hotel REIT that has a stronger business profile than CDLHT but similar financing flexibility, which drives the rating difference. Host Inc. owns a portfolio of more than 90 luxury and upper-upscale hotels mostly in the US. CDLHT has a considerably smaller property portfolio of 19 hotels and one retail mall, although this portfolio is more geographically diversified. The risks from CDLHT's smaller portfolio are mitigated by the trust's predominantly lease-based income and lower share of hotel operating costs, which results in more stable cash flows and higher EBITDA margins of 64%-65%. Comparatively Host Inc.'s cash flows stem from its sole investment in its hotel owner-operator Host Hotels & Resorts LP, resulting in Host Inc. being fully exposed to the income and expenses of its hotels, as reflected in its considerably lower EBITDA margins of 26%-27%. Both trusts benefit from strong financing flexibility as evidenced by FFO fixed-charge cover of more than 6x, net debt/ property value of between 35%-40%, and their mostly unencumbered property portfolios. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue growth of 9% in 2017 and 6% in 2018, stemming from new acquisitions made in 2017 - Occupancy of Singapore properties to stabilise at around 84%-85% in 2017-2018 - Refurbishment and maintenance capex to remain around 10% of revenue - EBITDA margin to remain around 65% in the next two years RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - No positive rating action is anticipated over the next 24 months. Positive rating action could be considered if CDLHT can substantially increase the scale and geographic diversity of its property portfolio while maintaining its current financial profile. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Heightened interest-rate risk, which may be evident from FFO fixed-charge cover sustained below 4x - FFO-adjusted net leverage sustained above 6.5x and net debt / investment property assets sustained above 40%-45% - A sustained decline in EBITDA, combined with a weakening in EBITDA margins to below 60% LIQUIDITY Comfortable Liquidity: CDLHT had a SGD90.2 million committed, unutilised, multi-currency revolving credit facility at its disposal at end-March 2017, and a further SGD300 million uncommitted multi-currency bridging loan facility at its disposal. In addition, CDLHT secured a new uncommitted SGD200 million multi-currency bridge loan facility in 2Q17 to acquire The Lowry Hotel in May 2017, and approximately SGD105 million of this facility is also available to be drawn if required. The trust does not have any borrowings maturing in 2017, and we expect it to comfortably meet our expectations of negative FCF in the next 12 months. CDLHT will utilise part of its multi-currency bridging loan facility to complete the acquisition of the Pullman Hotel Munich in July 2017, which it then expects to refinance using longer-tenor borrowings. We expect the trust to be able to roll over its maturing debt in 2018 given its healthy performance to date, and solid financing flexibility.

The FTSE 100 was up 0.3 percent by 0810 GMT, lagging the broader European market which gained 0.6 percent. It was set for its first day of gains in five after a downbeat week. Oil companies, which have been the worst-performing this year, supported gains among blue-chips and mid-caps, buoyed by higher crude prices after the first fall in U.S. drilling activity in months alleviated some concerns over a supply glut. Tullow Oil rose 2.5 percent, while oil services firms Petrofac and Amec Foster also gained. Oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell made more modest gains on the blue-chip index.  Having led everyone down for most of the second quarter, crude prices are trending up slightly,  said Ian Williams, economics and strategy analyst at Peel Hunt. HSBC,, Lloyds and Barclays were among top gainers after several central bankers last week indicated their intention to begin monetary tightening.  Given the trend in sentiment over the rate outlook, the financials having been calm before that, you would expect them to be moving back to the top of the list again,  said Williams. Glencore,, whose trading arm also benefits from higher crude prices, led gains among miners, also supported by better than expected factory activity data from China. Provident Financial, whose profit warning sent its shares plummeting 18 percent on June 21, was the top faller after Liberum analysts said another profit warning for the Home Credit division was likely.  Guidance remains too optimistic, in our view,  they said. United Utilities and Severn Trent fell 1.6 and 1.3 percent respectively after a downbeat note from Bernstein on the UK water sector. It said upcoming regulation could dent firms' profitability and M&A; was unlikely.  We do not believe the market is adequately pricing in the risk of a material reduction in the weighted average cost of capital and the heightened political risk, which makes M&A; unlikely,  said Bernstein analysts, downgrading United Utilities and Severn Trent. Among mid-caps, Electrocomponents gained after its first-quarter results impressed with a 13 percent growth in revenues. Its shares climbed 2.8 percent, taking its gains over the past 12 months to 133 percent. They were near their highest level since the 2000 tech bubble. Investors were also readying for the stream of second-quarter earnings updates from UK corporates to begin.  The next few weeks will be quite telling. There's still a little bit of upside potential in the overseas earners, and the domestics especially will be interesting to watch given the pressures on the UK consumer,  said Williams.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.

Kuwait's foreign minister arrived in Kuwait, which is acting as mediator, to respond to the demands. There is still no clear sign that Qatar will accept enough of the demands to satisfy the four states or that the dispute will be resolved. If not, fresh sanctions could be imposed - Saudi Arabia's Okaz newspaper reported that the boycotting countries would ask international companies to choose between doing business with them or with other countries. But the Doha index, which fell 2.3 percent on Sunday, was up 0.3 percent after an hour of trade as some stocks favoured by foreign funds were the top gainers. Mobile phone operator Vodafone Qatar rose 1.1 percent. Foreign funds have been taking advantage of reduced valuations in the Qatari market because of its recent plunge and have been net buyers of Qatari shares in the last two sessions, according to bourse data. In Dubai, the index was up 1.3 percent as 24 shares rose and only two declined. Shares favoured by short-term retail traders were the most active, with GFH Financial adding 4.4 percent and property developer DAMAC jumping 5.3 percent. Abu Dhabi's index dipped 0.2 percent, weighed down by the top two shares by market value; telecommunications operator Etisalat, down 0.6 percent, and First Abu Dhabi Bank , off 0.5 percent. In Saudi Arabia, the index edged down 0.3 percent, snapping three days of strong gains. National Commercial Bank retreated 2.0 percent, pulling away from a 21-month high. Petrochemical shares, however, were firm as Brent oil headed back near $50 a barrel. Nine of the 14 listed producers rose; Alujain was the best performer, adding 1.4 percent.

Djokovic has dropped to fourth in singles rankings after an inconsistent season and the 30-year-old's Aegon International triumph on Saturday was only his second title of the year.  Don't be surprised,  eight-time grand slam winner Agassi, who joined Djokovic's team prior to French Open in May, was quoted as saying by the Guardian newspaper.  Can a guy like this objectively find his way back to the trophy? Heck, yeah he could....That's the plan, that's always the plan – to get better – and the belief in winning has to be yours and yours alone.  I think there's enough momentum that could build to give that particular dream, hope or objective a real shot.  The American said his growing familiarity with Djokovic has led to a better understanding of the game-plan, which could guide the 12-time grand slam champion back to his best.  I know him so much better now than I did coming in and that's so important. I can effectively say there is belief in what the plan is and how we're going to go about it,  Agassi said.  It will get more nuanced and layered as we go – it's problem solving and I am enjoying learning, I'm enjoying giving some tools and I have the utmost belief that it's going to make him once again the best of who he is.  Djokovic also has added Mario Ancic, who reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 2004, to his coaching team for his SW19 campaign, which starts with a match against Slovakia's Martin Klizan in the first round on Tuesday.

Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose to 59.6 from 59.5 in May to reach its highest level in 74 months. That was higher than a flash reading of 59.3 and well above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction.  German manufacturers turned out another impressive performance in June with the PMI rising for the sixth time in seven months to the highest since April 2011,  said Markit economist Trevor Balchin. He added:  The latest PMI data therefore strongly suggest that the manufacturing sector will continue to boost German GDP in the second quarter.  High input prices, which are seen as a threat to the momentum in the sector, eased in June, Markit said. Input price inflation fell from April's 71-month record to the weakest since November 2016. However, it remained higher than the long-run survey average mainly because of higher raw material prices. Data last week showed German consumer inflation had accelerated unexpectedly in June driven by higher costs for food and services. The figures suggested a solid upswing in Europe's largest economy is slowly pushing up underlying price pressures. The German economy is enjoying a consumption-driven upswing supported by a robust labor market and an environment of low borrowing costs. The pace of job creation in the manufacturing sector slowed slightly in June from May's six-year high but firms continued to report having to expand capacity to meet demand. Manufacturers were also increasingly optimistic regarding the outlook for production and some said they expect stronger demand from Asia and the Middle East. The Ifo economic institute said last month that vibrant domestic demand and strong export growth fueled by a recovery in the euro zone will boost growth in Germany this year and next, raising its 2017 growth forecast for Europe's largest economy.

Its Short-Term Foreign-Currency and Local-Currency IDRs have also been affirmed at 'F2'. The Outlook on the Long-Term IDRs is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Extensive Business Portfolio: Panasonic's credit profile benefits from its extensive product portfolio, including consumer electronics and auto-, housing-, industrial- and energy-related products, which reduces volatility in the company's overall operating performance. We expect Panasonic to maintain market leadership in its major products based on its ability to develop products with advanced technology and its well-established brand and distribution channels. This mitigates the risks of operating in cyclical and competitive industries, such as electronics and auto components. Margin Stability Improves: We expect Panasonic to maintain stable profitability after the restructuring of unprofitable businesses, downsizing of the consumer-electronics business and reduction in fixed costs. A recent shift in its strategy to expand business-to-business solutions, especially in auto-related components, will bring further stability to its earnings. We expect Panasonic to generate EBIT margin of 4%-5% over the medium term compared with 4.7% (US GAAP based) in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 (FYE17), although a delay in recovery of the Japanese housing market, an increase in R&D; expenditure and unfavourable currency movements are likely to result in some deterioration in Panasonic's performance in the next two years. Accelerating Investment for Growth: Panasonic continues to invest in business areas where it has strong expertise, such as auto and housing, in order to achieve sustainable profit growth. The company aims to increase its operating profit (IFRS based) to JPY450 billion by FYE19. The increasing investments to expand revenue and profit are necessary, but the strategy carries risks as it takes time before the new business areas contribute meaningfully to profit. We believe the company will be able to maintain its credit strength, which depends on its ability to maintain its current financial profile while investing in growth. Conservative Balance Sheet: Panasonic's balance sheet should remain conservative in the medium term as the operating cash generation is sufficient to fund incremental investments, although the gross leverage ratio is likely to come down relatively slowly due to capex and investment. However, we forecast the company to turn free cash flow positive from FYE18 after a slight deficit in FYE17, and funds from operations (FFO)-adjusted leverage to be around 2x by FYE19-FYE20 after increasing to 2.8x in FYE18. DERIVATION SUMMARY Panasonic's credit profile is stronger than that of other Asia-based consumer electronics companies, such as LG Electronics Inc. (BBB-/Stable) and Sony Corporation (BB/Positive), both in terms of profitability and leverage. In addition, we believe Panasonic has a superior business structure that generates more stable margins with higher resilience against cyclical consumer electronic demand. Panasonic's business profile is weaker than peers in the appliances and capital goods manufacturing segment, such as Whirlpool Corpo. (BBB/Stable) and Continental AG (BBB+/Stable), due to its higher exposure to low-margin products and highly competitive markets. However, this is largely mitigated by Panasonic's higher product diversification and more conservative capital structure with net cash position. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue to increase by the mid-single-digits in FYE18, due mainly to the recovery in domestic housing-related segments and sales growth in automotive related businesses (such as, lithium-ion battery) - EBIT margin to stay around 4%-5% in the short term - similar to the previous year (FYE17: 4.6%) - as most business segments are generating stable margins - Capex to increase to around JPY380 billion in FYE18 as indicated by management, and is likely to stay at a high level in the short term. - FCF to turn positive for the next few years after the deficit in FYE17, although higher capex may reduce the FCF margin to 1%-2% in the medium term (FYE17: -1.5%) RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action: - Operating EBIT margin sustained above 5.5% - FFO-adjusted leverage sustained below 1.5x Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Operating EBIT margin sustained below 4.5% - FFO-adjusted leverage sustained above 2.0x However, FFO-adjusted leverage above this target alone will not necessarily lead to a downgrade if the company is deleveraging and forecast FFO-adjusted net leverage remains below 1.0x LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: Fitch expects Panasonic's liquidity to remain strong. At end-March 2017, Panasonic's unrestricted cash of JPY1.2 trillion comfortably covered its debt due within one year of JPY177 billion as well as long-term debt of JPY947 trillion. The company has been in a net cash position since 2QFYE15, driven mainly by strong operating cash inflow. We expect the company to maintain solid liquidity with reduced volatility in earnings. Previous analysis of Panasonic did not include receivables factoring as debt, as required by Fitch's rating criteria for non-financial corporate entities. Correction of this error led to an increase in FFO-adjusted gross leverage. However, the ratings have been affirmed as we believe Panasonic's credit metrics taken as a whole - including margins, free cash flow and net leverage  - justify a 'BBB'/Stable rating.

Signs of shift towards policy tightening last week from central bank officials outside the United States drove the euro above $1.14 to its highest in over a year, but the central support of higher market interest rates continues to favour the greenback. German 10-year bond yields have jumped more than 20 basis points in the past week but remain close to 2 full percentage points lower than their U.S. equivalent. Yen yields are another 40 basis points lower.  The reason why U.S. yields have gone up is important: they have been following European yields higher in the past week,  said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.  What that tells you is that dollar yen is the safest dollar long and dollar yen is near the highs. Our base case remains that U.S. data rebounds sufficiently to allow the market to price in more (tightening) from the Fed than it does currently.  In a session set to be quietened by the absence of many traders before the U.S. July 4 holiday, the dollar was 0.2 percent higher against the euro and the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength. It gained 0.4 percent to 112.82 yen but with oil prices almost 1 percent higher, was slightly less robust against the bloc of major currencies seen as closely linked to commodities prices. The Canadian dollar was holding onto gains that took it past C$1.30 per U.S. dollar, emboldened by growing bets in the market for a rise in interest rates by the Bank of Canada next week. Canadian bank RBC was the latest to flip last week in favour of a rate rise and the bank's analysts said on Monday the next targets for the loonie technically were below C$1.29.  The recent break below strong congestive support at 1.3000 exposes 1.2823 and 1.2764 as the next supports of note for USD/CAD on the downside, with a return above 1.3186 required to negate the current downtrend,  they said. All eyes on Tuesday will be on the Reserve Bank of Australia for signs of it joining the hawkish chorus among major central banks. Any shift in the wording of the bank's statement might support the Aussie, which was just under 0.2 percent off last week's highs on Monday.

The volume-weighted average rate of the benchmark seven-day repo traded in the interbank market, considered the best indicator of general liquidity in China, was 2.8284 percent on Monday afternoon, nearly 7 basis points lower than the previous day's closing average rate at 2.8936 percent.      China's central bank skipped open market operations for the seventh day in a row on Monday, as liquidity levels in the banking system were  relatively high , the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in an online statement.     Traders said the short-term money supply was adequate on Monday, with the central bank's decision to skip open market operations having no impact on sentiment yet.     However, a trader at a Chinese bank said such cash conditions are unlikely to last long with large volumes of loans from open market operations and the medium-term lending facility (MLF) due to mature in the first half of July.     In the first two weeks of July, maturing reverse repos are set to drain a total 530 billion yuan ($78.08 billion). In addition, two batches of MLF loans worth 179.5 billion yuan are due to mature on July 13, according to Reuters calculations based on the official data from the PBOC.      Others have compared current central bank operations and liquidity situation to events in March and April, when the PBOC skipped 13 straight sessions of open market operations.      If the central bank adopts the similar action this time, not resuming open market operations before the MLF loans mature, liquidity pressure faced by the banking system would be far bigger than that in April,  said Ming Ming, an analyst at CITIC Securities, pointing out matured loans in early April were less than the ones this month.     Ming said he did not expect the central bank to change its  not too loose, not too tight  monetary policy as regulators' deleveraging campaign was still continuing.     On Monday, China and Hong Kong launched a long-awaited  Bond Connect  scheme that links China's $9 trillion bond market with overseas investors, the latest step in Beijing's efforts to liberalise and strengthen the country's capital markets.     Early indications showed promise for the development of an active debt market, with more than 2 billion yuan of bonds purchased in the first 22 minutes of brisk trade.

India has traditionally trodden a careful diplomatic line in the region, analysts say, wary of upsetting Arab states and Iran - upon whom it relies for its vast imports of oil - and its large Muslim minority. It has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, even as it quietly pursued ties with Israel.  But now Modi is lifting the curtain on a thriving military relationship. He will hold three days of talks with his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, to advance sales and production of missiles, drones and radar systems under his signature  Make in India  drive, officials in Delhi and Tel Aviv said. Netanyahu, hailing what he described as Modi's  historic visit , said on Monday he and the Indian leader have worked together over the past few years to build a  steadfast friendship  between Israel and India.  This visit will deepen cooperation in a wide range of fields - security, agriculture, water, energy - basically in almost every field Israel is involved in,  Netanyahu told his cabinet in public remarks. Modi will not travel to Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority and a customary stop for visiting leaders trying to maintain a balance in political ties. At home, the apparent shift in what has long been a bedrock of India's foreign policy risks sharpening criticism that the country's 180 million Muslims are increasingly being marginalized under Modi's Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, which swept to power in 2014.  Narendra Modi's visit to Israel will only strengthen its occupation of Palestine,  said Asaduddin Owaisi, a member of India's federal parliament from a regional group that promotes Muslim rights. Burgeoning Relationship In previous decades, under the left-leaning Congress Party, former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was a regular visitor to New Delhi, pictured hugging then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi when the two were championing the Non-Alignment Movement. In May, Modi hosted Arafat's successor, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and offered help in health and information technology, but the trip was low-key.  The scale of the ongoing collaboration with Israel dwarfs anything India is attempting with the Palestinians, officials say.  We have a wide ranging partnership with Israel that ranges from agriculture cooperation to homeland security,  said Bala Bhaskar, head of the foreign ministry's West Asia division. He said India's ties with Israel and Palestine were important in their own right and neither should viewed through the prism of the other. But an Israeli diplomat said Modi's standalone trip to Israel was an important signal. The two sides are expected to announce strategic partnerships in areas including water, agriculture and space technology during Modi's visit.

{"news_time":"2017-07-03 03:47:00","news_title":"Fitch Affirms eHi at 'BB-'; Outlook Revised to Negative","keywords":"Australia,Brazil,China,New Zealand,South Korea,Taiwan,United Kingdom,United States,Kalai Pillay,Li Chen,Wai,Lun Wan,Yee Man,Fitch Affirms eHi at 'BB,'; Outlook Revised to Negative,Automobiles / Auto Parts (Legacy),Credit / Debt Ratings,Hong Kong,China (PRC),Credit and Corporate Debt,Corporate Events,Automobiles and Auto Parts (TRBC),Asia / Pacific,Auto : Truck and Motorcycle Parts (TRBC),Debt / Fixed Income Markets,Cyclical Consumer Goods and Services (TRBC),Emerging Market Countries","sector":"","content":"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, July 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed China-based car rental and services operator eHi Car Services Limited's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), senior unsecured rating and the rating of eHi's outstanding USD200 million 7.5% senior notes due 2018 affirmed at 'BB-'. The Outlook is revised to Negative from Stable. The Outlook revision reflects the company's higher leverage, ongoing capex requirements and Fitch's expectation that deleveraging is not probable in the next few years. KEY RATING DRIVERS Rising Leverage: Fitch expects eHi's FFO-adjusted net leverage to remain above 3.0x over the next few years, even though the company is starting to moderate its expansion and capex plans for 2017. eHi's FFO-adjusted net leverage rose sharply to 3.4x in 2016, from just 0.8x at end-2015, due to higher-than-Fitch-expected net capital expenditure for vehicle fleet expansion, despite strong growth in EBITDA and FFO. Capex to Moderate: Fitch expects eHi to slow capital expenditure in 2017, following capex of CNY3.7 billion in 2016. The company is exploring financing options to lower its cash outlay on vehicle purchases. eHi's capex is also constrained by covenants on its syndicated loan, which require that total debt/EBITDA falls below 3.5x by end-2017. National Expansion, Market Leader: eHi remains one of China's leading car rental companies, with majority market share in Shanghai and eastern China. Its total fleet size rose by 50% to 56,916 vehicles and total revenue increased by 45% to CNY2.1 billion in 2016. eHi also expanded its geographical footprint to cover 216 cities. Fitch expects eHi to continue expanding and for its fleet size to reach almost 67,000 vehicles by end-2017. The company has also narrowed the gap between itself and the market leader, CAR Inc. (BB/Negative), over the previous two years, with faster revenue and fleet expansion. Competitive Pressure, Regulatory Risk: China's car rental and services market continues to change rapidly. eHi faces fierce competition, particularly from CAR Inc., which cut its prices at the beginning of 2017. This has not directly affected eHi's margins so far, but may pressure its pricing and profitability if it continues. China's regulatory framework is also evolving and some changes may adversely affect eHi's operations. DERIVATION SUMMARY eHi has a smaller operating scale and weaker financial profile than other Fitch-rated car rental operators, such as CAR Inc., China's largest car rental operator, and Localiza Rent a Car S.A. (BB+/Negative), Brazil's leading rental car operator. However eHi has lower concentration risk compared with CAR Inc., which is exposed to one large customer. No Country Ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects have an impact on the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - 20,000 vehicles added and 10,000 vehicles disposed in 2017 - 37% revenue growth in 2017, then 4%-12% in 2018-2020 (2016: 45%) - EBITDA margin of 45%-47% in 2017-2020 (2016: 44%) RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to the Outlook being revised to Stable - FFO-adjusted net leverage sustained below 3.0x (2016: 3.4x) - EBITDA margin sustained above 50% Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - FFO-adjusted net leverage above 3.0x for a sustained period - FFO fixed-charge coverage below 3.0x for a sustained period (2016: 3.8x) - EBITDA margin below 40% for a sustained period LIQUIDITY Satisfactory Liquidity: eHi has sufficient liquidity, with CNY787 million of cash and cash equivalents and CNY63 million in undrawn loan facilities at end-2016. We expect the company to successfully roll over its domestic bank loans. However, eHi has CNY2.3 billion in debt maturing in 2018, including the USD200 million bond and 60% of the USD150 million syndicated loan. Liquidity risk will increase if the company fails to address its refinancing needs by end-2017. eHi signed a five-year framework agreement with China Development Bank Corporation (A+/Stable) in 2015, which covers various financing products for an aggregate amount CNY1.5 billion, of which CNY218 million had been drawn at end-2016. Some of these products are restricted for specific purposes, such as new vehicle purchases, but may nonetheless provide an additional source of liquidity.

India has traditionally trodden a careful diplomatic line in the region, analysts say, wary of upsetting Arab states and Iran - upon whom it relies for its vast imports of oil - and its large Muslim minority. It has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, even as it quietly pursued ties with Israel.  But now Modi is lifting the curtain on a thriving military relationship. He will hold three days of talks with his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, to advance sales and production of missiles, drones and radar systems under his signature  Make in India  drive, officials in Delhi and Tel Aviv said. Netanyahu, hailing what he described as Modi's  historic visit , said on Monday he and the Indian leader have worked together over the past few years to build a  steadfast friendship  between Israel and India.  This visit will deepen cooperation in a wide range of fields - security, agriculture, water, energy - basically in almost every field Israel is involved in,  Netanyahu told his cabinet in public remarks. Modi will not travel to Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority and a customary stop for visiting leaders trying to maintain a balance in political ties. At home, the apparent shift in what has long been a bedrock of India's foreign policy risks sharpening criticism that the country's 180 million Muslims are increasingly being marginalized under Modi's Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, which swept to power in 2014.  Narendra Modi's visit to Israel will only strengthen its occupation of Palestine,  said Asaduddin Owaisi, a member of India's federal parliament from a regional group that promotes Muslim rights. Burgeoning Relationship In previous decades, under the left-leaning Congress Party, former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was a regular visitor to New Delhi, pictured hugging then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi when the two were championing the Non-Alignment Movement. In May, Modi hosted Arafat's successor, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and offered help in health and information technology, but the trip was low-key.  The scale of the ongoing collaboration with Israel dwarfs anything India is attempting with the Palestinians, officials say.  We have a wide ranging partnership with Israel that ranges from agriculture cooperation to homeland security,  said Bala Bhaskar, head of the foreign ministry's West Asia division. He said India's ties with Israel and Palestine were important in their own right and neither should viewed through the prism of the other. But an Israeli diplomat said Modi's standalone trip to Israel was an important signal. The two sides are expected to announce strategic partnerships in areas including water, agriculture and space technology during Modi's visit. But it is the defense relationship that is most advanced - India is now Israel's biggest arms market, buying weapons at an average of $1 billion each year.  Eli Alfassi, executive vice president of marketing at state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), the country's biggest defense firm, said it was supplying India with drones, radar, communication systems and cybersecurity.

The bad blood between the heirs of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first prime minister, has gripped the city-state since mid-June, when the younger siblings launched a series of attacks on their elder brother in social media postings.  In normal circumstances, in fact, in any other imaginable circumstance than this, I would've sued immediately,  Lee said in a statement to a rare special sitting of parliament, before taking questions from members. He said any such action would  further besmirch my parents' names , while drawn-out legal proceedings would distract and distress Singaporeans.  Therefore, fighting this out in court cannot be my preferred choice,  the prime minister said. The prime minister's younger brother and sister, Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling, allege Lee Hsien Loong has abused his power in the dispute over the old family home at 38 Oxley Road, and fear that he would use the organs of the state against them.  Lee Hsien Yang has said he and his wife, lawyer Lee Suet Fern, would be leaving Singapore because they felt closely monitored and hugely unwelcome. Related CoverageSingapore PM says wants to avoid legal action against siblingsThe prime minister has consistently denied the allegations, and said he was very disappointed that they have chosen to publicize private family matters.  'Not a Korean Drama Show' Monday's parliamentary session was extraordinary for Singapore, a small but wealthy island nation that prides itself on being a rock of stability in Southeast Asia. The accusation of abuse of power prompted Lee to call for the special sitting of parliament to defend the integrity of his government. Taking a rare step, Lee removed the Party Whip for the debate, allowing lawmakers from the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) to question their own cabinet regardless of the party line. The PAP controls 83 of the 89 elected seats in parliament, and lawmakers submitted their questions in writing at the end of last week. More than 30 lawmakers were due to put questions over the course of Monday and Tuesday. Low Thia Khiang, a leader of the opposition Workers' Party, criticized the prime minister for not taking his siblings to court, saying there was no reason they should be treated differently from other citizens. He also said that if the siblings had evidence of the prime minister lying or abusing power  they should have made them public by now  rather than conduct a media campaign that had left Singaporeans in suspense.  The government needs to move on. I am personally perplexed and lost on the Lee family saga,  said Low.  However, this is not a Korean drama show.  Lee Hsien Yang and his sister, Lee Wei Ling, say they want to honor their father's wishes, expressed in his will, for the house to be demolished once Lee Wei Ling vacates the property, rather than it be turned into some kind of museum.  Prime Minister Lee has questioned the will, while a government committee, from which he has recused himself, considers whether the old family home should eventually be turned into a heritage site. He has said his personal view is that the house should be demolished in accordance with his father's wishes, but the decision rests with the government. His siblings suspect him of being disingenuous and have suggested he wants to preserve the house for political reasons, but Lee insisted that was untrue.   Regarding the house, and how its continued existence enhances my aura as PM, if I needed such magic properties to bolster my authority even after being your PM for 13 years, I must be in a pretty sad state,  he said.

{"news_time":"2017-07-03 03:34:00","news_title":"Q&A: Arjun Rampal on the making of gangster film ‘Daddy’","keywords":"India,Arjun Rampal,Arun Gawli,INDIA,FILM,BOLLYWOOD,ARJUN,RAMPAL,DADDY,Arts / Culture / Entertainment","sector":"","content":"REUTERS - In 2014, when a producer came to Arjun Rampal and proposed a movie about gangster Arun Gawli, the actor was a little puzzled. Which role would he play? “The title role, of course,” was the answer. Rampal didn’t see any resemblance between him and Gawli, but that meeting planted the seed of an idea in him. Three years later, Rampal is co-producing and acting in “Daddy”, where he plays one of Mumbai’s most feared gangsters. Rampal spoke to Reuters about the film and the process of making it.  Q: What is the history of “Daddy”?  A: This film came to me when I was shooting for “Roy”. That was around 2014, and these producers came to me and said they wanted me to do a movie on Arun Gawli. They already had a director on board and I was wondering which character they wanted me to play. I read the script and hated it. They had this guy flying on cables and high-speed shots of him walking and it is just a very superficial film. I thought there would be a story there, but they were trying to make a commercial potboiler, which is what most people do with a gangster film in India. It is fine if it is just a gangster, but if it is a true story then you have to be true to it. And I didn’t see anything that was remotely like what his life was. But I was intrigued and they had done some work on the computer to show how I could look like him, though I was still not convinced. I told them, “If you have the rights and want to make it, why don’t you make a proper biopic.” I started pulling out material to give to writers, and they were keen on exploring it, so I have to give them credit for that. But it was always filmy, going down some kind of a fictitious mode and losing the realism of it, which a biopic really needs. Then I locked myself in a room for three months and started writing it. I sent it to Ashim (Ahluwalia) and he loved it. But he told me, “We have to have a frank chat because you are not going to be jumping off roofs in this film.” That was exactly what I wanted. Those producers saw us working on this film together and said, “These guys are a disaster”, (laughs) and ran away.  Q: Did they give you the rights? They didn’t have the rights. That is what we found out. That is why they ran. Then we started talking to the family, convincing them etc. We got the script ready and took it to the big man and started shooting.  Q: Was there ever a temptation not to go to Arun Gawli and make his story without permissions? A: Once you get so obsessed about a character and there are so many incidents in his life which are so interesting, it would be cheating to do that. It would be cheating that other person of it, but you would also be cheating yourself. One of the main reasons I wanted to tell this story was – Why is this guy not called “Bhai”? Why is he not called “Don”? Why is he not called “Godfather”? He is called “Daddy”.  Going deeper to find out why is a very interesting story. A man who spent all his life in jail, came out and actually reformed. Did he actually reform or was that a mask? That is another layer you want to explore, but at the same time, not making a propaganda film.  It is not about making an opinion on him being a messiah. It is a human story – where he came from and how he ended up here. When I met him, I realised he is a very humble man. He is very quiet, very soft-spoken, very well-mannered and got a lot of grace in him. How many people do you find sitting in high positions who give their word and keep it? Q: What did you make of him when you met him? Did it change your perception of him? Handout photo from  Daddy A:  He is a simple man. He is a smart man. He thinks ten steps ahead of you. He is not very expressive. He has a lot of resilience in him. To still have that energy after all he has experienced, that positivity is what makes him larger than life. Q: Looking at the trailer, the resemblance is uncanny, especially to a younger Gawli. What went into it? A: That was the scary part of it. When we both decided we are making the movie, the next thing was, will I look like him? I had lived this character so closely by now, I had researched so much about him, had lost 8 kgs before the look test happened. And just before I was about to go into the look, I said, “What if I don’t look like him? And what if it is a complete disaster?” And the answer to me was - Ashim is still going to direct this movie, I am still going to produce it but we’ll get another actor to do it. I sat in that chair and we did the look test and it was uncanny. It all came together.  Q: What was the shoot like?A: It was not a small film. It was a film that kept getting scale, without us even realising it - the detailing of it, the sync sound, the ambience of the place. You are going to shoot in places which hated Arun Gawli, and I am Arun Gawli. We were like, “What the hell are we doing? Will we even get out of here alive?” Handout photo from  Daddy Q: Did you have to take any precautions? A: The main subject is what you have be concerned about and to get his blessings for a film that will not be made like the ones which glamourise you and make you heroic. That was made very clear to him. We were going to keep it real and we were going to tell his story the way it is. If he was not comfortable with it, we wouldn’t have made the film. Q: So you didn’t want it to be a sanitised version of his story. A: Not at all. Not at all. (Thinks) Actually we did sanitise it a bit later. (Laughs). I can’t tell you what, though. I thought I could live with it, but sometimes I wish that scene was there in the film. Q: Were you asked to remove it? A: You know, if someone makes a film on me and I see something in the film that makes me go, “Dude, just don’t do that”, though it isn’t that person’s choice either because you have given the rights and signed off on it, on a human level I felt we went overboard with it and that is why I was OK with taking it out.  Q: What do you make of the way Bollywood makes its biopics? A: I don’t judge anybody. Each one to their own. Some people like to make it to a palate which appeals to a wider range of people, keeping in mind the economics of it. Some people like to keep it pure. Ashim is a purist. I am a purist. Everyone who was associated with the film was either a purist, was converted into one, or left the film (laughs).  Is it really true to Arun Gawli’s life? No, we have taken certain liberties. It is good that people are moving towards true incidents. Also there is a real dearth in good fiction writing so it is better to take stories that are real and people can identify it.

Ahluwalia’s 2012 film “Miss Lovely” was an entry at the Cannes Film Festival, but he hasn’t made any other film since then. He was at first reluctant when actor Arjun Rampal asked him to consider making a biopic on Arun Gawli, a one-time henchman of mafia boss Dawood Ibrahim who later broke away and formed his own gang. What eventually convinced him, Ahluwalia said, was that Gawli was a fascinating character and Rampal didn’t want to make a typical Indian gangster film. “In our first chat about the film, I told him, ‘You are not going to be jumping off rooftops’. And he told me, ‘That is exactly what I want,’” Ahluwalia said in an interview.  Rampal, a former ramp model who made his Bollywood debut 15 years ago, was approached by another producer to act in the film, but was not convinced by the script. He took the idea to Ahluwalia, who doesn’t particularly subscribe to Bollywood’s ideas of how to make a movie. His “Miss Lovely”, an eloquent portrait of those that populate Mumbai’s soft-core porn industry, won accolades at Cannes and other festivals. For long, Bollywood’s gangster movies have romanticised the criminal, portraying him as a man wronged by the system and who turns to crime reluctantly. Amitabh Bachchan made a career out of playing a gangster with a golden heart in films like “Deewaar” and “Agneepath”. Recent movies like “Once Upon a Time in Mumbai” and Shah Rukh Khan’s “Raees” have followed the same path. In Bollywood, the gangster always gets redemption before the closing credits start rolling. “There is no redemption in my film. Yes, there is empathy, but the ending is very factual. It is not a clean-up job” he said.  Related CoverageQ&A: Arjun Rampal on the making of gangster film ‘Daddy’Rampal and Ahluwalia approached Gawli for permission to make his biopic before shooting the movie. Gawli, who is serving a life sentence for the murder of a politician from the right-wing Shiv Sena party, was more than forthcoming, even giving them permission to include scenes where he smokes a chillum (a pipe used to smoke cannabis). Known among his followers as “Daddy”, Gawli’s stronghold in Mumbai was the Dagdi Chawl, a colony of seven buildings that houses families in one-room tenements. His family still lives there.  An unemployed youngster during the famed Mumbai textile strike, Gawli led a bloody gang war against Dawood Ibrahim in the 1980s but was never in jail for a long time. His gang of extortionists and contract killers spread terror in and around Mumbai, but also found patronage in the Shiv Sena, which felt the police should go easy on Gawli because he was a local man, as opposed to his Muslim rivals.  Handout picture from “Daddy”In 2012, he and eleven other acquaintances were convicted in the killing of politician Kamlakar Jamsandekar. Ahluwalia says while he feels empathy for a man who was an “accidental gangster,” there is no attempt to whitewash Gawli’s crimes, including several alleged murders. “I wanted that sense in the film, that you know him completely and yet you never know him. The film is told from the point of views of six different characters who know him, but never from his perspective. One from his mother or wife, who tells how hard it was, and you feel empathy for him. Another is at the side of a gangster who left the gang and has negative things to say about him. You can never quite put your finger on this man,” he said. Ahluwalia and his crew recreated Gawli’s hideout, but also shot in real locations in some of Mumbai’s dodgiest areas. He shot with no bound script, often writing dialogue on set based on what the environment was like. Slideshow (2 Images)“Maybe you have some great dialogue written by your dialogue writer, but then on set it sounds filmy and wrong. That is why you have to have a relationship with your actors and crew. To be able to say, ‘Arjun, this is not working, man. Let’s drop it and do something else,’” he said. The crew also shot in areas where Gawli’s biggest rivals lived, an environment that was openly hostile to them.  “I like putting people in this insanity. It is not healthy but it is very good for the movie. Taking people into really difficult locations and getting them out of their comfort zone. You are on edge there because you are getting yelled at by real gangsters or there are rats falling from the ceiling.” Even so, the film couldn’t quite be a no-holds-barred version of Gawli and his life because of some things that “are still under legal examination.” “I don’t want to make a movie that puts Arun Gawli at risk. He’s opened up himself to us and as filmmakers. We have to protect that without doing a whitewashing job. He’s given you all that info, it is in your hands what to do with it, and I wouldn’t want to exploit that,” he said. “Daddy” releases in theatres on July 21.

Shares in Plus500 rose as much as 9.72 percent to its highest since November last year, before trading up about 9 percent at 595.6 pence on Monday on the London Stock Exchange. The company said trading exceeded its expectations with new customer sign-ups and reduced average user acquisition cost (AUAC), leading to a higher earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization margin compared to last year.  The outcome of the year will be subject to the balance between the benefit of the positive trading conditions... set against the possible negative impact of the expected regulatory changes in a number of our countries of operation,   Plus500 said in a statement. Regulators have been moving to tighten controls on the fast-growing 3.5 billion pound ($4.56 billion) spreadbetting industry. Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in December it had found evidence of poor conduct across the market over the past six years and that people using the most popular product - known as a contract for difference (CFD) - lost 2,200 pounds a year on average. CFDs allow people to bet on moves in share prices without having to buy the underlying stock. Binary options are a bet on whether a stock or other instrument will trade above or below a set level in future. Shares in Plus500 and rivals CMC Markets and IG Group fell heavily after the FCA intervention. The British watchdog last week said it would delay the publication of its final rules as its proposals were broadly similar to what the European Securities and Markets Authority was discussing. The European Union's markets watchdog said on Thursday it was discussing a bloc-wide crackdown on  speculative products  bought online by retail customers to bet on market moves.

Okada, 74, told Reuters in an interview that he saw a lawsuit as the only way to get his son and daughter to the negotiating table after they took control of the board of a Hong Kong company at the center of his business holdings in May. Okada Holdings Ltd, the Hong Kong company that is majority owner of Tokyo-listed gambling machine maker Universal Entertainment Corp, is also a defendant in the suit, according to the Hong Kong High Court online database, though Okada himself didn't confirm that. It was unclear on what grounds the suit was brought and no other details were available from the court. Okada declined to respond to questions about the details of the suit, which Reuters was unable to view, but said he believed he had been wronged by the move to push him out as director of Okada Holdings, a change that was registered on May 12, according to a public filing. Okada said he hasn't seen his son Tomohiro in two years and does not know his daughter Hiromi's current whereabouts. Reuters was unable to reach either of them at addresses in public records. Both are Okada's children from a previous marriage. Okada said he hoped a lawsuit would prompt a judge to order them to negotiate a settlement that would restore his position at Okada Holdings.  Unless I sue there will be no opportunity to talk. The reality is I am in a losing position in terms of voting rights,  Okada said, referring to his 46.4 percent stake in Okada Holdings, versus Tomohiro and Hiromi's combined 53 percent. Okada said he did not find out he was dropped as Okada Holdings' director until May 18. He said Universal's board told him on May 23 that he was being investigated for alleged misuse of company funds. That was followed by Universal's announcement on May 31 that he would not be reappointed to its board.  I was totally blindsided,  Okada said. The interview took place last Thursday in the restaurant of a Tokyo hotel where Universal was holding its annual shareholders' meeting. Okada had been denied entry on the grounds he is not a direct shareholder since the Hong Kong holding firm holds his stake. Universal declined to respond to Okada's assertions. It said it would make additional disclosures once an internal investigation it recently launched to probe Okada's alleged improper use of company funds had submitted its findings.

Okada said he planned to investigate the matter. Okada said he was confident he could convince Hiromi to support him as long as he could get her brother to work towards a settlement. As for his wife Takako, Okada said he could not forgive her for agreeing to be reappointed to Universal's board. The company said Thursday that Takako would take on responsibility for Okada's art museum and advise the company on its overseas business. Takako, 43, did not respond to letters left at her home, an email sent to her company address, or a request to speak relayed through her mother.  Last month, Universal issued a press release accusing Okada and another director of misappropriating some $20 million in company funds in three transactions during 2015. It convened an investigative panel composed of three attorneys that is now looking for other alleged irregularities. Okada described the company’s allegations as  nonsense . For example, he said one of the transactions in question was a loan not due until November that had been used for a legitimate purpose: to expand junket operations aimed at attracting high-rollers to Universal's casino in the Philippines.  That contract is still active. There is no problem.     Okada said he could not provide a copy of the contract for Reuters to review because it was located at a company office to which he no longer has access. Okada said he viewed the investigation as an attempt by Universal President Jun Fujimoto to seize control. Okada noted that he had handpicked Fujimoto to help lead the company founded five decades ago.  I made Fujimoto president. Now he wants to take over.  Fujimoto called Okada  unfit  to be the director of a public company and vowed to prove that with  irrefutable physical evidence  in a private letter to a shareholder on June 21, Reuters reported last week. Universal declined to make Fujimoto available for comment. Universal said it was not in a position to comment about Okada's allegations against Fujimoto. Two new directors at Okada Holdings did not respond to emails seeking comment.

The pound recorded its best weekly performance against the dollar in almost eight months last week. It climbed almost 2.5 percent to reach as high as $1.3030 after BoE Governor Mark Carney said a rate rise was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity, and that the Bank would debate this in the coming months. For the quarter, sterling's performance was its best in two years, benefiting from broad dollar weakness as U.S. economic data disappointed and as investors' hopes for pro-business, pro-growth policies from President Donald Trump faded. Following Carney's comments - which were followed by similar remarks by the BoE's chief economist Andy Haldane - investors moved to price in around a 50 percent chance of a rate hike by the end of the year. But not all analysts are convinced that the BoE will follow through with its hawkish rhetoric as Britain negotiates its way out of the European Union. Even if rates increase slightly, that will not necessarily spell the start of a steady policy tightening cycle, they say.  What may have been a subtle attempt by BoE officials to put the question of policy normalisation onto the table has in fact led to markets now pricing in odds of a 2017 rate hike equivalent to a coin toss,  wrote ING currency strategist Viraj Patel in a note to clients.  (But) even if the post-Brexit 25 basis point rate cut is reversed, structural impediments are likely to keep UK interest rates anchored at historically low levels and this points to limited sterling upside from BoE policy.  Patel said July's macro data would be  the biggest test of this hawkish exuberance  and that the bank expected this week's purchasing managers' index (PMI) surveys to point to a summer slowdown. The manufacturing sector PMI is due at 0830 GMT. Speculators had increased their short positions on sterling in the week up to last Tuesday, before the BoE's latest comments. Sterling was 0.1 percent lower on the day ahead of the manufacturing data at $1.3010. Against the euro, it was flat at 87.62 pence.  With the UK edging into the mature stage of the economic cycle and political noise around Brexit set to act as a catalyst for volatility, we see relatively limited short-term upside,  anaylsts from BMI Research wrote.

Remarks last week from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that the central bank could make tweaks to its policy to accompany the recent economic recovery triggered the biggest weekly jump in Bund yields since December 2015. The ECB is working on moving away from its ultra-easy monetary policy, Jens Weidmann, head of Germany's Bundesbank and a member of the ECB's rate-setting body, said on Saturday. Data on Monday provided fresh signs that the euro zone economy is gaining momentum. Dutch manufacturing activity grew at its strongest rate in more than six years in June, a survey showed. Still, in a sign that the heavy selling seen across world bond markets last week was abating for now, bond yields in the euro zone nudged 1-2 basis points lower. When a bond's price rises, its yield falls. In Germany, the bloc's benchmark issuer, Bund yields edged back from 3-1/2 month highs at 0.498 percent and were down about 1 bps on the day.  The market reaction last week was very sharp and now is probably the time to digest recent comments,  said Patrick Jacq, European rates strategist at BNP Paribas.  July could be a more supportive month for bonds as there is less supply, but clearly the trend is now upwards for yields.  Bund yields have almost doubled within the space of a week and analysts say a break for the benchmark Bund above 0.509 percent - the high so far this year hit in March - is on the cards as investors position for tighter monetary policies inside and outside the euro zone. U.S. Treasury yields rose to six-week highs on Friday as inflation data was not considered weak enough to delay Federal Reserve plans to hike interest rates. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said last week that Britain's central bank was likely to debate a rate increase in coming months, fuelling a sell-off in global debt markets.

Espenilla, who previously headed banking supervision in the Philippines, began his six-year term as President Rodrigo Duterte's administration prepares for a six-year, $180 billion spending spree on infrastructure, in a bid to sustain galloping growth. While the country's growth prospects remain positive,   Espenilla said the central bank needs to be mindful of potential vulnerabilities to ensure the economy remains on solid ground.   We have to be prepared for the seemingly imminent wind-down of ultra-easy monetary policies in advanced economies,  said Espenilla, who took over from the well-respected Amando Tetangco after a 12-year tenure. The U.S. Federal Reserve has been raising rates and is looking to start reducing its massive balance sheet. At the same time the European Central Bank and even the Bank of Japan are cautiously looking to the end of monetary easing. Global markets took fright at the Federal Reserve's first hint that it might taper its monetary expansion policy in 2013. That so-called taper tantrum sent bond yields up sharply and sowed turmoil in world markets from Rio de Janeiro to Jakarta.  We need to be mindful of such events and their potentially far-reaching consequences since these could undermine our economic performance and disrupt our carefully-laid plans,  Espenilla said in a speech. Outgoing Philippine central bank governor Amando Tetangco (L) raises the hand of new central bank governor Nestor Espenilla during a turnover ceremony at the central bank headquarters in Metro Manila, Philippines July 3, 2017.Romeo RanocoThe Philippines, which has enjoyed 73 quarters of uninterrupted growth, continues to enjoy manageable inflation, that has allowed policymakers to leave policy settings unchanged since a 25 basis-point hike in rates in September 2014. Espenilla said the central bank would continue to  fine-tune  its monetary policy to make it  more market-oriented , which would entail a constant review of policy tools, including banks' reserve requirements and the interest rate corridor.  He added banks' current required reserves, currently at 20 percent, would have to be lowered eventually, but that this would not happen immediately.    We need to find a path to lower the reserve requirement without compromising on price stability,  he said.  Remember, when we built up the reserves, this was largely during the time of the global financial crisis. So that's the flip side of the global financial crisis... There will come a time when we need to manage that as well and reduce the size of the balance sheet of the BSP,  Espenilla said.  The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' first policy meeting under Espenilla will be on Aug. 10. He pledged to work with other agencies to develop the debt market to support the infrastructure plan. The 58-year old career central banker also promised greater access to financial services to ensure the benefits of growth are broadly felt.

Kasbarian had never been involved in politics before joining the independent centrist party when it was set up a year ago. Now he wants to put the spark back into politics in his Eure-et-Loir constituency south west of Paris to reengage disillusioned voters who stayed away from the ballot box in record numbers.  Politics has become boring as hell, we need to make it fun again and bring it to people where they live,  he said in the garage where he is discussing how to customize the 1950s wooden caravan for its new role.

A majority are from Macron's party, mocked by rivals as inexperienced yes-men to the 39-year-old whose victory in May shook up French politics. Many say they want to do things differently.   Of course if we don't deliver concrete results that's all pointless, but it's important to get the fun element back in,  said Kasbarian, one of Macron's 308 lawmakers. Townhall meetings were not enough to engage voters, he said as spent a day touring his constituency to meet local residents including firemen wanting to discuss work hours and farmers pushing for a change in pesticide laws.  Jupiterian President  French lawmakers often spend at least three days a week in parliament in Paris debating and voting on laws, networking, and pushing for things such as high-speed trains for their region. The rest of the time is spent working in constituencies on anything from listening to views on how laws should be crafted or cutting ribbons at local fairs. Veterans say newbies will soon see their ambitions crushed by the complexity of the lawmaking and the overarching control the government has on parliament. The discipline required by each political group also leaves little room for individual lawmakers to maneuver, especially if they have not built up political weight over the years.   All governments want a parliament that just obeys orders, ministers will call you and say 'Come on, you can't do that, it will make the government look bad,  said Dominique Raimbourg, a Socialist lawmaker in 2007-2017 who lost his seat last month. He said the Socialist government pressured him when he  pushed for amendments to draft criminal laws and often used tactics to get its way including sending bills at the last minute, vetoing amendments and shuffling the agenda around.  It will be all the more difficult with a Jupiterian, or rather Bonapartist, president,  Raimbourg said. Critics have compared Macron to the early 19th century autocratic French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte while Macron himself has called his vision of leadership  Jupiterian  after the Roman god of gods who spoke rarely except to issue orders.  Not Robots  French newly-elected lawmaker Guillaume Kasbarian, of  La Republique en Marche  (Republic on the Move or LREM) political party, gets out of his customised caravan during a day touring his constituency, in Epernon, France, June 26, 2017.Gonzalo FuentesKasbarian said he was well aware of the difficulties ahead, would be loyal to Macron and will make his voice heard.  Most people voted for us to give Emmanuel Macron a majority in parliament...we need to remember this,  he said, driving in a car with a floor and seats still covered in campaign leaflets.  We'll have disagreements, we're not robots, but we'll discuss them among ourselves...rather than running to the press to complain.   Macron and his team want to avoid the kind of rebellion faced by previous president Francois Hollande from some Socialist party lawmakers. They are exerting tight control over lawmakers, who had to sign a  contract with the nation  that lays out his policy plans, and attend a two-day training seminar the weekend after their election.      They also want to avoid the pitfalls of Hollande's many on and off-the-record chats with journalists and are keeping the press at arms' length. The first test will come quickly for Kasbarian, the son of two civil servants of Armenian descent. He wants to push for amendments to a draft bill on political transparency being discussed in parliament this month that would forbid lawmakers from holding consultancy jobs to avoid conflicts of interest. Slideshow (7 Images)Kasbarian said at a consultancy farewell party that he hoped to bring corporate drive to a parliament which includes fewer career politicians than before and counts 143 business executives and 30 company bosses in its ranks.  All these new lawmakers who come from the private sector might be a bit naive at first but they will hopefully also be more vigilant,  said Pouria Amirshahi, a former lawmaker elected on a Socialist ticket in 2012, saying not having been involved in politics for decades might make them more free to speak up. Amirshahi said he had a reality check when he saw  that the executive branch controlled everything.   Hollande decreed labor legislation spearheaded by his then-economy minister Macron for fear of it being voted down in parliament.     Fast Food Lifestyle Kasbarian, who will be a member of parliament's economic affairs committee, took a pay cut from 6,200 euros ($7,081.02)per month as a consultant to just under 5,500 euros as a lawmaker. Grabbing a burger during the tour of his constituency, he worries about the impact a politician's life could have on his waist line. He is also concerned about the image lawmakers sent to voters in its first days, after fierce late night exchanges among colleagues about who would get the top roles of organizing parliament's work.   It wasn't a pretty sight,  Kasbarian said.  Back at the garage, where the caravan will be repainted in blue and gray, 43-year-old garage owner Sylvain Lacroix-Beauchet said he voted both for Macron and Kasbarian.  But careful, you can't disappoint us, in a year or two you'll need to have something to show for it.   The last time there were as many fresh faces in France's parliament was in 1958 when wartime hero Charles de Gaulle was president. It eventually ended badly for many of the newcomers. They voted a no-confidence motion in 1962 and de Gaulle immediately dissolved parliament to call snap elections.

Such an arrangement would likely hurt the consortium's efforts to clinch a deal, despite being named the preferred bidder last month with an offer of around 2 trillion yen ($18 billion). Japan's government is keen to keep the chip business under domestic control and has been wary of allowing foreign firms to access Toshiba's memory technology. SK Hynix plans to buy convertible debt in a special purpose company being created by Bain Capital for the Toshiba acquisition, said one of the sources, adding that terms were still being negotiated. SK Hynix declined to comment while representatives for Bain could not be immediately reached for comment. A Toshiba spokesman said the company cannot comment on the specifics of the deal. The sources declined to be identified as the talks were confidential. Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa has repeatedly said that SK Hynix would not be holding any equity in the chip unit and would not be involved in management. Such an arrangement is unlikely to raise regulatory red flags and would prevent leaks of key technology information, he said. The current scheme proposed by the preferred bidder consortium has raised eyebrows as sources familiar with the matter say a state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan, would hold the biggest equity interest despite putting up only 300 billion yen ($2.7 billion). Bain plans to put up 850 billion yen - half of that amount to be provided by SK Hynix in the form of financing, the sources have said.

The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.5 percent, to 3,650.85 points, with some industry-leading blue-chips retreating from record highs after having rallied strongly this year. The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent to 3,195.91 points. The market has largely priced in an upbeat earnings season, which starts on Monday. As of June 29, 1,210 Chinese  A-share  firms had issued guidance for interim results for 2017, and 72 percent of those saw earnings growth, according to UBS Securities. Growth guidance was particularly strong in sectors including non-ferrous metals, electronics, property, light manufacturing and chemicals, it said. Although solid earnings help short-term sentiment,  we reiterate our view that earnings growth could slow to 5 percent in H2 and recommend investors to be more defensive,  wrote UBS analyst Gao Ting, who warned that financial regulation will likely remain tough. Echoing concerns about liquidity, OCBC analyst Tommy Xie cautioned that  it may be too early for the market to lower the guard against regulatory tightening as we think financial de-leverage remains a top policy priority for China.  He said July will be another important month to monitor as sizable loans made under the central bank's medium-term lending facility (MLF) will mature this month. Small-caps outperformed blue-chips on Monday, with the SSE 50 Index, an index tracking the 50 most representative blue-chips in Shanghai Stock Exchange, dropping 0.7 percent, while the start-up board ChiNext was up 1 percent. Sector performance was mixed. The defensive consumer and healthcare stocks dragged the most, while commodity shares rose on the back of higher raw material prices triggered by recent dollar weakness.

Espenilla, who previously headed banking supervision in the Philippines, began his six-year term as President Rodrigo Duterte's administration prepares for a six-year, $180 billion spending spree on infrastructure, in a bid to sustain galloping growth. While the country's growth prospects remain positive,   Espenilla said the central bank needs to be mindful of potential vulnerabilities to ensure the economy remains on solid ground.   We have to be prepared for the seemingly imminent wind-down of ultra-easy monetary policies in advanced economies,  said Espenilla, who took over from the well-respected Amando Tetangco after a 12-year tenure. The U.S. Federal Reserve has been raising rates and is looking to start reducing its massive balance sheet. At the same time the European Central Bank and even the Bank of Japan are cautiously looking to the end of monetary easing. Global markets took fright at the Federal Reserve's first hint that it might taper its monetary expansion policy in 2013. That so-called taper tantrum sent bond yields up sharply and sowed turmoil in world markets from Rio de Janeiro to Jakarta.  We need to be mindful of such events and their potentially far-reaching consequences since these could undermine our economic performance and disrupt our carefully-laid plans,  Espenilla said in a speech. Outgoing Philippine central bank governor Amando Tetangco (L) raises the hand of new central bank governor Nestor Espenilla during a turnover ceremony at the central bank headquarters in Metro Manila, Philippines July 3, 2017.Romeo RanocoThe Philippines, which has enjoyed 73 quarters of uninterrupted growth, continues to enjoy manageable inflation, that has allowed policymakers to leave policy settings unchanged since a 25 basis-point hike in rates in September 2014. Espenilla said the central bank would continue to  fine-tune  its monetary policy to make it  more market-oriented , which would entail a constant review of policy tools, including banks' reserve requirements and the interest rate corridor.  He added banks' current required reserves, currently at 20 percent, would have to be lowered eventually, but that this would not happen immediately.    We need to find a path to lower the reserve requirement without compromising on price stability,  he said.  Remember, when we built up the reserves, this was largely during the time of the global financial crisis. So that's the flip side of the global financial crisis... There will come a time when we need to manage that as well and reduce the size of the balance sheet of the BSP,  Espenilla said.  The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' first policy meeting under Espenilla will be on Aug. 10. He pledged to work with other agencies to develop the debt market to support the infrastructure plan. The 58-year old career central banker also promised greater access to financial services to ensure the benefits of growth are broadly felt.

Parents and teachers have complained that children were becoming addicted to the multiplayer online battle game, which, according to the company, has more than 200 million users, making it the world's most popular game of its kind. Users below 12 years of age will be limited to one hour of play time each day, while those aged between 12 years and 18 years will be limited to two hours a day, Tencent said. The firm also plans to ban users under 12 years from logging in after 9 pm (1300 GMT) and will impose further restrictions on how much money younger users spend on the game, it added.  There are no rules to prevent indulgence in online games in China, but we decided to be the first to try to dispel parental worries by limiting play time and forcing children to log off,  Tencent said on its official WeChat account. Tencent, which has a portfolio of over 200 games, also said it would upgrade a parental-control platform rolled out earlier this year that makes it easier for parents to monitor their children's gaming account activities. It will also step up the requirement of real-name registration for all users, it said. The fantasy role-playing game based on Chinese historical characters raked in a revenue of more than 5.5 billion yuan ($810.47 million) in the first quarter, Chinese gaming industry database CNG estimates. China's mobile gaming revenue grew by 4.5 billion yuan to 27.5 billion yuan over the period, the biggest growth in two years. Tencent, which declines to provide a revenue breakdown of its games, made 12.9 billion yuan from smartphone games in the first quarter, according to its financial report. According to mobile data intelligence firm Jiguang, Honour of Kings has become China's most popular game in recent months, doubling its monthly active users to 163 million in May compared with December. More than half of its users are below 24 years of age, including more than a quarter below 19 years, it said. China is the world's largest gaming market by revenue, and is expected to account for roughly 25 percent of global game sales in 2017, according to research firm NewZoo.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked down 0.1 percent, staying within a stone's throw of its two-year peak hit last week. Japan's Nikkei ticked up 0.2 percent while U.S. stock futures gained 0.2 percent. European stock futures opened higher, with Germany's DAX futures up 0.6 percent, France's CAC futures adding 0.9 percent and Britain's FTSE futures advancing 0.4 percent. Pan-European Euro first 300 stock index hit a 10-week low on Friday after the European Central Bank and the Bank of England last week signalled their readiness to tighten their monetary policies.  Up until recently, only the Fed was tightening its policy. If the ECB is also jumping on to this, that is huge. We can't take this lightly,  said Arihiro Nagata, head of derivatives at SMBC Nikko Securities. Global bond yields have risen sharply following hawkish comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi last Tuesday, with German bond yields posting their biggest weekly jump since December 2015 last week. That helped to lift U.S. bond yields from lows, with the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield hitting a 1-1/2-month high of 2.330 percent on Monday. The uptick in European bond yields could encourage European investors, who have been pouring their money on higher U.S. yielding bonds, to put their money back in Europe. The rise in U.S. bond yields came even as data showed U.S. inflation cooled in May. The annual rise in core consumer prices excluding food and energy slowed to 1.4 percent, its lowest since December 2015.  In coming weeks, whether we can see a recovery in the U.S. momentum will be a key issue,  said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. On Wall Street, the S&P; 500 scored its biggest gain for the first half of the year since 2013 while the Nasdaq Composite's first-half gain was its best in eight years. Signs of stabilising in China's economy and a recovery in the European economy helped to boost global share prices in the first half of this year. A private sector survey on China's manufacturing showed a surprise recovery in activity, adding to the evidence of steadying growth in the world's second largest economy. The Bank of Japan's tankan corporate survey showed Japanese business sentiment improved slightly more than expected. In the currency market, the euro traded at $1.1405, not far from last week's high of $1.1445, which was its highest level in more than a year as the common currency drew support from expectations that the ECB will likely scale back its stimulus. Jens Weidmann, head of Germany's Bundesbank and a member of the ECB's rate-setting body, said on Saturday that the ECB is working on moving away from its ultra-easy monetary policy. The dollar traded at 112.58 yen, off Thursday's six-week high of 112.93. The yen briefly gained on worries Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's reflationary policies may be at risk after his Liberal Democratic Party suffered an historic defeat in a local election in Tokyo on Sunday, though the impact did not last long. Oil prices held firm after having gained for seven consecutive sessions by Friday, after data on that day showed U.S. oil rig count RIG-OL-USA-BHI fell last week for the first time since early January. Brent crude futures rose 0.2 percent to $48.88 per barrel while U.S. crude futures gained 0.4 percent to $46.20 per barrel. In the Middle East, Qatari shares slumped to 1-1/2-year lows on Sunday as a deadline for Doha to accept a series of political demands by four Arab states were expected to expire late in the day with no sign of the crisis ending. Saudi Arabia and three allies accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism later agreed to a request by Kuwait to extend by 48 hours Sunday's deadline for Doha to comply, according to a joint statement on Saudi state news agency SPA.

The announcement from the Reserve Bank of India late on Friday on a 100 billion rupees ($1.55 billion) sale of government bonds surprised traders, who had expected it to happen in August near the time when the central bank must pay a hefty dividend to the government. The RBI has so far resorted to selling short-end securities through a special scheme to drain some of the excess cash, a method that was seen as less disruptive than removing liquidity through regular OMOs. Traders said the open market sale appeared intended to help offset bond redemptions of 526.20 billion rupees due July 9, with another 303 billion rupees in August, which would have added liquidity to the financial system.  It looks like they are timing it with bond redemptions,  said one senior dealer at a foreign bank, noting the overall impact of the open market bond operation would likely end up being broadly neutral on liquidity The new 10-year bond yield jumped as much as 11 basis points to 6.62 percent in early trade, its highest level since June 7, from its close of 6.51 percent. It was trading at 6.59 percent at 0600 GMT. The five-year benchmark overnight indexed swap was at 6.34 percent compared with its previous close of 6.28 percent. Indian banks were flushed with deposits after the government abolished high-value currency notes late last year in a push to unearth billions of dollars of so-called black money, forcing people to deposit their unused notes with banks. The fall in bonds comes after a recent rally as lower-than-expected inflation data had raised hopes for a rate cut as early as the RBI's policy review on Aug. 2. Traders expect the central bank to conduct at least two to three more OMO sales in the July-September period given surplus liquidity of around 3 trillion rupees in the banking system, much above the RBI's traditional tolerance level of 1 trillion rupees.

In a closely-watched Bank of Japan survey released on Monday morning, confidence among big manufacturers hit its highest in more than three years in the June quarter, adding to signs the recovery in the world's third-largest economy is gaining pace. But the result of the Tokyo Metropolitan assembly election on Sunday, in which Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) suffered an historic defeat, sapped the market's overall mood. The outcome signals trouble ahead for the premier, who has suffered from slumping support because of a favouritism scandal. The Nikkei share average tacked on 0.1 percent to 20,055.80. Market observers said the ruling party's defeat would have a negative impact on foreign investors' appetite for Japanese stocks in the short term.  Abe's support rate has been falling, and this result made the mood worse,  said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.  That said, although the ruling party was defeated in the Tokyo poll, it's not like Abe's administration will end soon, so foreign investors are not expected to change their portfolios based on this result for now.  Exporters were mostly solid on Monday, as the dollar gained 0.2 percent to 112.58 yen. Toyota Motor Corp rose 1.0 percent, Subaru Corp climbed 1.7 percent and Panasonic Corp gained 0.7 percent. Outperforming the market was industrial waste disposal business operator Daiseki Co, which jumped 6.9 percent after its operating profit surged 25.2 percent to 2.3 billion for the March-May quarter. The broader Topix gained 0.2 percent to 1,614.41 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 advanced 0.2 percent to 14,376.53.

Qatar has called the charges baseless and says the stiff demands - including closing Qatar-based al Jazeera TV and ejecting Turkish troops based there - are so draconian that they appear designed to be rejected. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have raised the possibility of further sanctions against Qatar if it does not comply with the 13 demands presented to Doha through mediator Kuwait. They have not specified what further sanctions they could impose on Doha, but commercial bankers in the region believe that Saudi, Emirati and Bahraini banks might receive official guidance to pull deposits and interbank loans from Qatar. According to a joint statement on Saudi state news agency SPA, the four countries agreed to a request by Kuwait to extend by 48 hours Sunday's deadline for compliance. Foreign ministers from the four countries will meet in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss Qatar, Egypt said on Sunday. Kuwait state media said its Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah had received a response by Qatar to the demands. It did not elaborate. The four states cut diplomatic and commercial ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism, meddling in their internal affairs and cozying up to regional adversary Iran, all of which Qatar denies. Mediation efforts, including by the United States, have been fruitless. Trump spoke separately to the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in the UAE to discuss his  concerns about the ongoing dispute , the White House said.  He reiterated the importance of stopping terrorist financing and discrediting extremist ideology. The president also underscored that unity in the region is critical to accomplishing the Riyadh Summit's goals of defeating terrorism and promoting regional stability,  the White House said.  President Trump, nevertheless, believes that the overriding objective of his initiative is the cessation of funding for terrorism,  it said. Urging Restraint A State Department official said on Sunday that the United States encourages  all parties to exercise restraint to allow for productive diplomatic discussions.  Qatari officials have repeatedly said the demands are so strict that they suspect the four countries never seriously intended to negotiate them, and were instead seeing to hobble Doha's sovereignty. But they have also said Qatar is interested in negotiating a fair and just solution to  any legitimate issues  of concern to fellow member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE. Qatar's Gulf critics accuse Al Jazeera of being a platform for extremists and an agent of interference in their affairs. The network has rejected the accusations and said it will maintain its editorial independence. Gulf countries have insisted the demands were non- negotiable. The UAE's minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, has played down the chances of an escalation, saying  the alternative is not escalation but parting ways , suggesting Qatar may be forced out of the GCC. The Western-backed body was formed in 1981 in the wake of Iran's Islamic Revolution and the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war. Speaking in Washington last week, the Qatari foreign minister said the GCC was set up to guard against external threats.  When the threat is coming from inside the GCC, there is a suspicion about the sustainability of the organization,  Sheikh Mohammed al-Thani told reporters.

India on Saturday rolled out its biggest tax reform in the 70 years since independence from British colonial rule, replacing more than a dozen federal and state levies with the GST. The unveiling of GST led some of India's biggest automakers and retailers to announce price cuts, although many companies shied away from doing so due to the complexity of the new system.  FMCG companies like ITC are going to benefit in the long run from the GST rollout,  said Anupam Singhi, chief operating officer at independent research firm William O'Neil India.

They’re angry with journalists too.  As reporters covered the fire at the apartment block last week, some residents turned on Jon Snow of Channel Four News, the most senior of Britain’s news presenters, and accused journalists of being vultures attracted to death and tragedy. “You didn’t come here when people were telling you that the building was unsafe!” one man told Snow. “That is not newsworthy. You come here when people die. Why?”  The Grenfell residents are hardly alone in accusing the media of not serving their needs. It’s no secret that trust in the media has declined. But the latest Reuters Institute Digital News Report, published this week, provides sobering insights into how the digital revolution has disrupted the way we gather the information we believe we need to orient ourselves in the world, or in our neighborhood.  The report shows that trust in the media varies from country to country, from over 60 percent in the Scandinavian countries to the low 20s in Greece and South Korea.  In the United States, trust in the media has risen from 33 percent during last year’s election campaign to 38 percent this year.    That may be because, as the Reuters report notes,   “concern about the spread of false news online” increased the perception of the value of professional journalism.    Most sobering is the report’s comment that “the economic outlook for most media companies remains extremely difficult.” That statement doesn’t include the communications giants like Twitter, Facebook and Google, the latter two of which garner more than 80 percent of the advertising that used to go to traditional media.  But two issues are likely larger. One is what Janine Gibson, the chief editor of Buzzfeed UK, calls “representation without judgment.” Speaking at a seminar in London this week, Gibson said that the digital and social media world implicitly equates what news organizations spend time and money verifying, with “the guy in an attic” who puts out a piece of opinion masquerading as news, without having had to exercise his judgment on the veracity of his narrative.  The latter, said Gibson, “is of course much quicker than the news which checks, because checking takes time.” The result, too, can be duller. The more careful is the reporter, the more complex becomes the story. But the guy in the attic can be simple, dramatic – and attract the eyeballs.  At an extreme, the attic-writer is putting out “fake news” - a commodity popularized by President Trump, who seems to see all news which does not praise him as “fake.” Fake news may have won Trump the presidency. Even if not, his use of it gives credence to a tendency to distrust news we don’t like.  It’s also becoming clearer that measurements of “trust” in the news media don’t really measure trust in the news media. They measure pleasure gained from the media. The Digital News Report says that there exists “a strong connection between trust in the media and perceived political bias.” That is, people trust the reports which flatter and further their views.  This isn’t new: people have chosen publications which line up with their political choices throughout the history of news. But for most of that history, those who consumed journalism did so passively. There was no comeback, except through a letter to the editor (probably unpublished) or a cancelled subscription.  Now readers are empowered by technology, often aggressive in their distrust and disgust, to intervene in stories. James Harding, director of news at the BBC, speaking at the same event as Buzzfeed’s Gibson, said that “we at the BBC are very careful to make clear what we don’t know as well as what we know. But people now can fill the space of ’don’t know’ themselves”.  We still live in the first phase of a revolution, not just of journalism but also in the ways in which we seek and use information, and in what we place our trust. As printing disrupted the late medieval world, so the replacement of print by digits has disrupted the 21st century. It is presently calling into question the nature of truth, and the trust we can place in it.  Truth is hard to get right, especially at times of tragedies like that at Grenfell Tower. Finding and publishing it won’t always avoid anger directed at the messenger, but journalists need to show they are truth seekers rather than vultures feeding on tragedy.  That will give substance to journalism's necessary democratic role – and perhaps answer the “why” asked by the man who confronted Jon Snow.

But this year they are set for their best first half since 2014. The reason? Like much else, emerging equities have been transformed by technology. Just like the high performing U.S. tech shares -- Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google that were dubbed FANGs before Google's parent was renamed Alphabet -- the so-called BATs, comprising Chinese internet trio Baidoo, Alibaba and Tencent have changed an emerging equity landscape once heavy in energy and mining firms. But the BATs are just a small part of a whole  new economy  story in emerging markets, where the biggest companies by market capitalisation are now high-tech conglomerates Samsung , Tencent, Taiwan Semiconductor, Alibaba and South Africa's Naspers, Alongside a host of smaller IT or information technology, firms, mainly Asia-based, they comprise over a quarter of the index cap, on a par with banks and significantly above the 7 percent weight of energy firms. A decade ago, the share of energy in the MSCI emerging market index was over 15 percent, while IT was under 12 percent, MSCI data shows.  You are now getting the index composition effect with the BATs - the huge internet companies which are the (Chinese) equivalent of the FANGs in the U.S,  said Julian Mayo, portfolio manager at Charlemagne Capital.  One of the biggest myths of emerging markets is that they are commodity dependent and more specifically oil-dependent, when the reality is the four biggest markets, China, Korea, Taiwan and India are big importers of commodities,  Mayo added. That may explain why, when Brent crude has posted its worst first-half since 1998, MSCI's emerging share index has risen around 17 percent. Usually the index moves in lock-step with oil prices but since last year that correlation has been disrupted: Investors have been unfazed by oil's drop, having poured more than $40 billion into emerging equity funds year-to-date. Meanwhile, as the commodity supercycle has ebbed and crude prices have halved from early-2014 levels, the value of erstwhile giants Gazprom, PetroChina and Petrobras has taken a hit; Russia's Gazprom, the biggest MSCI EM stock in 2007, does not make the top 10 in 2017. Instead, a blistering U.S. tech sector rally, with gains of nearly 20 percent has lifted emerging IT shares.  IT is now bigger than materials and energy in the benchmark which is a relatively novel development in a historical context  said Kiran Nandra-Koehrer, senior product specialist in Pictet Asset Management's emerging equities team. While IT is likely a  long-term structural story  in emerging markets, chances of the sector balance tilting back again towards oil hinges at least partly on whether the commodity super-cycle will make a comeback, she said. But with shale and renewable energy increasingly cost-effective, that looks unlikely in the near future. Links Not Severed Emerging markets have not severed energy links and countries such as Russia, Colombia and Nigeria still rely on crude exports. Indeed, equity resilience showed signs of cracking earlier in June as oil prices headed towards $40, while commodity-heavy Russian stocks are this year's worst performers. Many investors draw parallels with U.S. junk-rated bonds, almost a fifth of which are energy firms but are also showing better resilience to the oil price dip than during the 2014 price collapse as their business models evolve. Patrick Esteruelas, head of research at EMSO Asset Management, said a similar oil dip at the end of 2015 had fed through from the U.S. junk bonds to emerging markets.  If oil takes another leg lower and creates a credit event in U.S. high-yield, that can spread to EM,  he said. Others note the improved global backdrop since the last oil price reversal.  There are enough compensating factors to have a bit of decoupling. It doesn't mean the relationship is broken for ever but the level of oil price which starts to have a negative impact on emerging markets or U.S. shale is probably lower than before,  said Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, chief investment strategist with NN Investment Partners. But there is another positive effect from the IT sector's greater weighting, namely IT firms' higher return on equity (ROE), a key measure for stockpickers as it reflects how well a company uses shareholders' capital to generate returns. Currently, the emerging IT sector's average ROE is almost twice that of energy firms and well above the index average. A Morgan Stanley report on the subject noted the shift in the MSCI index  away from lower ROE, higher leverage, and excess capacity industries towards the higher ROE, lower leverage, non-capacity challenged New Economy industries.  It called IT's greater emerging markets weight  a structural positive that bodes well for the index's future performance.

The funding guarantee from News Corp co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch, Crown Resorts Ltd casino boss James Packer and regional TV owner Bruce Gordon buys the network time as the industry waits to see if the country's media ownership laws will be relaxed. PPB Advisory, Ten's newly appointed receivership specialist,  said the deal would allow the firm, the lowest rating of Australia's three national free-to-air broadcasters, to continue as a  going concern  until it is sold or recapitalized. It was, however, not immediately clear what would happen if no buyer was found before Aug. 31. PBB declined to comment further. The three business tycoons, who jointly own nearly 30 percent of Ten, have not commented on their plans for the TV station. But administrator KordaMentha said last month that they plan to financially support the network, adding that there had been  quite a number  of expressions of interest from potential acquirers.  This Murdoch group needs to make sure no one gets in there and picks up this company for a relatively small amount of money because obviously Murdoch wants to end up owning Network Ten,  said media analyst Peter Cox. A bill to ease media ownership laws is set to be debated in parliament in August. While it has the support of the federal government, it faces opposition in the Senate where independent politicians hold the balance of power. Australian cable TV company Foxtel, of which Murdoch's News Corp owns 50 percent, holds 14 percent of Ten and it is widely viewed as the most likely buyer if media ownership laws are relaxed.  Existing rules make it illegal for one company to own television, radio and newspapers in one place. News Corp currently publishes about two-thirds of Australian newspapers, and Murdoch personally owns a radio station, so he would face regulatory hurdles in buying Ten under current law. Ten shares have been suspended from trading since it called in administrators last month. They were called after Murdoch and Gordon declined to extend support for a A$200 million ($152 million) debt facility past 2017. The move was widely seen as a necessary step to help Ten re-negotiate costly content licensing fees with U.S. production studios.

Benchmark London copper futures touched $5,965 a tonne on June 30 after the official Chinese PMI rose to 51.7 in June, it's eleventh consecutive month on the positive side of the 50-level that marks expansion from contraction in the world's biggest manufacturing sector. Copper's gains didn't last beyond the Asian session, slipping as the U.S. dollar strengthened and also as London Metal Exchange data showed inventories of the red metal gained, indicating supplies are plentiful. Nonetheless, copper is holding around its strongest levels since March, and is up 8.2 percent since its recent closing low of $5,486 a tonne on May 8. Hedge funds and other money managers also seem to be backing the view that copper's recent rally still has further to run, boosting long positions by 9,531 contracts to 58,816, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data, released on June 30. The net-long copper position is now nearly double the 29,787 contracts reported on May 9, and a dramatic reversal from the net-short position of 47,109 contracts that prevailed a year ago, on June 14, 2016. It's probably no surprise that hedge fund managers have switched from net-short to net-long copper as the Chinese manufacturing sector has improved over the past year. But is this optimism still justified or is copper starting to look a little stretched? In past periods of gains in China's PMI, copper has certainly also rallied, and on one occasion since the 2008 global recession, it continued to rise even after the PMI peaked. The PMI was at 51.2 in June 2010 and rose to 55.2 by November of that year, while London copper rose from around $6,101 a tonne in June to a peak of $10,160 in February 2011. The PMI troughed at 49 in November 2011, before rising to 53.3 by April 2012, while copper bottomed slightly before the PMI, reaching $6,735 a tonne in October 2011, before hitting a top before the PMI, at around $8,760 in February 2012. Since then the PMI trended lower along with copper until the index hit a low of 49 in February 2016, slightly after the bottom for copper in January 2016. While the Chinese PMI is far from the only driver of copper prices, it appears to be a useful indicator. China Challenges Ahead The problem for copper bulls is that it's becoming harder to find analysts that think the PMI is going to extend its recent strong run. Most are bracing for weaker readings in the second half of 2017. This is largely because of the view that keeping China's stimulus spending going is becoming more of a challenge for the authorities in Beijing, especially given concerns over credit quality and a slowdown in the key residential property construction sector. There also appears to be a widening gap between large, mainly state-owned firms and small- to medium-sized private companies. The official PMI captures more of the large corporate sector, which appears to be more resilient to tightening credit conditions than the smaller businesses. The Caixin PMI, which measures more smaller businesses, did rise in June to 50.4, surprising market watchers, who had picked a reading of 49.5 in a Reuters survey of 25 analysts. However, it's worth noting that the Caixin PMI is only just in positive territory and well below the official measure. Another point from the Caixin PMI was confidence among Chinese manufacturers for the next 12 months fell to lowest level this year in June, underscoring the mood of caution that currently prevails. While the PMIs may on the surface be producing positive signs for copper, the detail shows the outlook is not as bullish as the rise in net-long positions may suggest. China's copper imports are also not looking that great for prices as well, with refined metal imports down 28.2 percent in the first five months of the year. Chinese buyers appear to be switching to scrap copper, with imports rising 17.6 percent in the first five months, a shift that is hardly going to boost the price of London futures. It's worth noting that scrap imports in the January to May period were 1.51 million tonnes, while refined imports were 1.27 million tonnes, a reversal from 2016, when refined metal imports were 3.7 percent higher than those of scrap. Putting the import data together with the two Chinese PMIs and the case for being cautious about the copper price outlook for the next few months seems to be more convincing than placing a bullish bet.

Other pharmaceutical giants including Merck & Co, Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi are also exploring the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to help streamline the drug discovery process. The aim is to harness modern supercomputers and machine learning systems to predict how molecules will behave and how likely they are to make a useful drug, thereby saving time and money on unnecessary tests. AI systems already play a central role in other high-tech areas such as the development of driverless cars and facial recognition software.  Many large pharma companies are starting to realise the potential of this approach and how it can help improve efficiencies,  said Andrew Hopkins, chief executive of privately owned Exscientia, which announced the new tie-up with GSK. Hopkins, who used to work at Pfizer, said Exscientia's AI system could deliver drug candidates in roughly one-quarter of the time and at one-quarter of the cost of traditional approaches. The Scotland-based company, which also signed a deal with Sanofi in May, is one of a growing number of start-ups on both sides of the Atlantic that are applying AI to drug research. Others include U.S. firms Berg, Numerate, twoXAR and Atomwise, as well as Britain's BenevolentAI.  In pharma's eyes these companies are essentially digital biotechs that they can strike partnerships with and which help feed the pipeline,  said Nooman Haque, head of life sciences at Silicon Valley Bank in London.  If this technology really proves itself, you may start to see M&A; with pharma, and closer integration of these AI engines into pharma R&D.;  Still to Be Proven It is not the first time drugmakers have turned to high-tech solutions to boost R&D; productivity. The introduction of  high throughput screening , using robots to rapidly test millions of compounds, generated mountains of leads in the early 2000s but notably failed to solve inefficiencies in the research process. When it comes to AI, big pharma is treading cautiously, in the knowledge that the technology has yet to demonstrate it can successfully bring a new molecule from computer screen to lab to clinic and finally to market.  It's still to be proven, but we definitely think we should do the experiment,  said John Baldoni, GSK's head of platform technology and science. Baldoni is also ramping up in-house AI investment at the drugmaker by hiring some unexpected staff with appropriate computing and data handling experience - including astrophysicists. His goal is to reduce the time it takes from identifying a target for disease intervention to finding a molecule that acts against it from an average 5.5 years today to just one year in future.  That is a stretch. But as we've learnt more about what modern supercomputers can do, we've gained more confidence,  Baldoni told Reuters.  We have an obligation to reduce the cost of drugs and reduce the time it takes to get medicines to patients.  Earlier this year GSK also entered a collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and National Cancer Institute to accelerate pre-clinical drug development through use of advanced computational technologies. The new deal with Exscientia will allow GSK to search for drug candidates for up to 10 disease-related targets. GSK will provide research funding and make payments of 33 million pounds ($43 million), if pre-clinical milestones are met.

If true, this would mark specs’ first net long in the soft red wheat market in nearly two years. In the week ended June 27, hedge funds and other money managers cut their net short in CBOT wheat futures and options to 10,158 contracts from 20,971 in the week prior, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (reut.rs/2sZTGhz). Profit-taking following the previous week’s massive round of short covering prevented speculators from further trimming the Chicago wheat position early in the week, but explosiveness in Minneapolis spring wheat futures on June 27 pulled other wheat contracts up with it, and they have been on their way up ever since. In K.C. wheat futures and options, money managers are ending June on the most bullish note ever. They extended their net long in the week ended June 27 to 44,240 contracts from 37,701 in the previous week, and the new stance is funds’ most bullish on the hard red wheat since April 1, 2014 (reut.rs/2u7RyTH). Funds also upped bullish bets in Minneapolis spring wheat futures and options, increasing their net long to 15,347 contracts from 12,720 in the week before. (reut.rs/2sZTBuA) Speculators went the other way on CBOT corn, expanding their net short to 106,119 futures and options contracts from 53,825 in the week prior. They had nearly wiped clean their bearish bets around mid-month over threatening U.S. weather forecasts, but largely benign outlooks ever since have led traders to once again hit the  sell  button. (reut.rs/2svj2kf) Wheat futures have been through the roof in the days since, though, especially Minneapolis, and funds may soon be bulls across all three wheat contracts. Drought continues to plague spring wheat in the Northern U.S. Plains, and lower-than-expected wheat acres in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s acreage report on Friday confirmed wheat’s upward march. Spring wheat acres in particular came in below expectations at a 45-year low and Minneapolis wheat futures have put on nearly $1 (or 13 percent) since June 27. Trade sources suggest that June 30 was the funds’ most active wheat buying day of the year thus far, as most-active CBOT September futures settled up the daily 30-cent limit, and spot CBOT wheat traded above $5 a bushel for the first time in a year. CBOT corn also followed wheat up on Friday, though gains were more modest under generally bearish stocks and acres from USDA. But uncertainties over conditions and weather still exist, and the weather outlook going into Monday will largely dictate the near-term direction of the corn market. Record Shorts in Soy, Meal Speculators reached new levels of bearishness in CBOT soybeans and soybean meal in the week ended June 27, completely dwarfing their extension of bullishness in soybean oil. But new records are extremely unlikely next week. Money managers expanded their net short in soybean futures and options to 118,683 contracts from 87,140 in the week prior. This surpasses the week ended May 26, 2015, for the most bearish by specs on the oilseed, and it marks only the second time on record in which the fund short surpassed 100,000 contracts (reut.rs/2t01Jv9). Funds also logged a new all-time net short in soybean meal at 54,430 futures and options contracts, replacing the old record of 50,941 contracts set back on June 6. Soybean meal futures have struggled in recent months amid a general abundance of feed ingredients, and funds have maintained a record bearish stance for the date since mid-May (reut.rs/2svCWeR). Soybean oil retained speculators’ overall optimism last week, as funds increased their modest net long to 10,511 futures and options contracts from 4,769 in the previous week (reut.rs/2u7FF09). The bean oil position prevented the soy complex from overtaking the week ended June 6 as the most bearish combined fund stance of all time. Futures market activity in the days since suggests the record will be safe again for the week ended July 4, and perhaps in the longer term pending U.S. weather forecasts. The bullish soybean stocks figures and lower-than-expected U.S. acres from USDA on Friday sent most-active November futures up 30 cents, and oil and meal followed along. Similar to wheat, June 30 may have been the funds’ most active soybean buying day of 2017. Editing by Matthew Lewis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/cbot-grains-braun-idUSL1N1JR1PQ"},

Indonesia was the top gainer in the region, with the Jakarta Composite Index rising as much as 0.7 percent to hit a six-week high, as trading resumed after a long holiday.      Sentiment in Southeast Asia was underpinned by a private sector survey that showed China's manufacturing engine cranked back into growth mode in June, expanding at the fastest pace in three months after unexpectedly contracting in May.      China's manufacturing PMI rebound is a silver lining and overall inflation is likely to be contained despite bottoming,  Mizuho Bank analysts said in a note.     Meanwhile, factory output contracted in Indonesia and Malaysia in June, while that in Vietnam expanded at a faster pace than the previous month, according to IHS Markit purchasing managers' indexes released on Monday.      In Indonesia, telecom stocks, financials and non-cyclical consumer goods companies contributed most of the gains.     The country's annual inflation rate accelerated slightly in June as demand increased in the days leading to the Eid al-Fitr celebrations at the end of the month, the statistics bureau said.     Singapore shares rose 0.2 percent, with real estate stocks dominating gains on the benchmark.     Malaysian shares fell as much as 0.4 percent, with telecom stocks dragging the index down. Maxis Bhd fell as much as 1.1 percent to its lowest in over a year.     Sentiment was also affected by Malaysian palm oil futures, which fell from a near two-week high on Friday, reversing gains made earlier, as they were weighed down by weaker exports and expectations of rising production.             Philippine index fell as much as 0.6 percent, hurt by industrials and telecommunication stocks.       The new Philippine central bank governor, Nestor Espenilla, said a cut in banks' required reserves is not going to happen immediately. The country's reserve requirement ratio is currently at 20 percent, one of the highest rates in the world.     BDO Unibank Inc fell 1.5 percent and conglomerate SM Investments Corp dropped 0.9 percent.

Without stating whether Qatar had rejected the ultimatum, as was widely expected, the Kuwait state news agency said Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah had asked Saudi Arabia and three other countries that have boycotted Qatar to grant it an extension. There is no clear sign that the extension means the parties see a resolution of the dispute as possible. But any funds taking positions just before a resolution could reap major gains. The Doha index fell 2.3 percent on Sunday. Local funds were net sellers by a very small margin for the first time since the crisis erupted on June 5, but foreign funds were net buyers for a second straight session because the market's plunge has reduced valuations. This pattern could continue on Monday. Gulf Cooperation Council investors remained net sellers of Qatar.  Though we cannot say with absolute certainty that some of the regional funds have rerouted to other markets such as Saudi Arabia, we can say yield-hunters will look for stocks with similar attributes if they want to stay away from Qatar,  said a regional fund manager - in many cases, blue chips offering relatively high dividends. Elsewhere, Dubai builder Arabtec may attract some interest after saying one of its units had won a 113 million dirham ($31 million) project in the prestigious Dubai Creek Harbour development. The Saudi index, which has been buoyant since MSCI said it would add Riyadh to a watch list for a possible upgrade to emerging market status and since a new, young crown prince was named, may stay firm as Brent oil is heading for an eighth consecutive day of gains. It was trading at $48.86 a barrel in Asia. (Reporting by Celine Aswad; Editing by Andrew Torchia)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-stocks-idUSL8N1JU0FY"},

Market players said the allocation change by the mammoth fund with total assets of 144 trillion yen ($1.3 trillion) may explain the strong performance of some Japanese stocks, such as Ajinomoto during the last quarter. The GPIF's move could prompt other, smaller Japanese corporate and public pension funds to start ESG investments, which have grown popular in the West, particularly in Europe, but have not gained much traction in Asia including Japan. The GPIF said its methodology is based on positive screening, in which investors choose companies which they think have good practice.

Archaeologists have found more than 650 skulls caked in lime and thousands of fragments in the cylindrical edifice near the site of the Templo Mayor, one of the main temples in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, which later became Mexico City. The tower is believed to form part of the Huey Tzompantli, a massive array of skulls that struck fear into the Spanish conquistadores when they captured the city under Hernan Cortes, and mentioned the structure in contemporary accounts. Historians relate how the severed heads of captured warriors adorned tzompantli, or skull racks, found in a number of Mesoamerican cultures before the Spanish conquest. But the archaeological dig in the bowels of old Mexico City that began in 2015 suggests that picture was not complete.  We were expecting just men, obviously young men, as warriors would be, and the thing about the women and children is that you'd think they wouldn't be going to war,  said Rodrigo Bolanos, a biological anthropologist investigating the find. Lorena Vazquez, an archaeologist from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), works at a site where more than 650 skulls caked in lime and thousands of fragments were found in the cylindrical edifice near Templo Mayor, one of the main temples in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, which later became Mexico City, Mexico June 30, 2017.Henry Romero Something is happening that we have no record of, and this is really new, a first in the Huey Tzompantli,  he added. Raul Barrera, one of the archaeologists working at the site alongside the huge Metropolitan Cathedral built over the Templo Mayor, said the skulls would have been set in the tower after they had stood on public display on the tzompantli. Slideshow (19 Images)Roughly six meters in diameter, the tower stood on the corner of the chapel of Huitzilopochtli, Aztec god of the sun, war and human sacrifice. Its base has yet to be unearthed. There was no doubt that the tower was one of the skull edifices mentioned by Andres de Tapia, a Spanish soldier who accompanied Cortes in the 1521 conquest of Mexico, Barrera said. In his account of the campaign, de Tapia said he counted tens of thousands of skulls at what became known as the Huey Tzompantli. Barrera said 676 skulls had so far been found, and that the number would rise as excavations went on. The Aztecs and other Mesoamerican peoples performed ritualistic human sacrifices as offerings to the sun.

Ride-hailing services such as U.S. group Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Southeast Asia's Grab and Indonesia's GO-JEK have heavily subsidized their drivers in Indonesia in order to gain market share in the country of 250 million people, analysts say. The transport ministry said in a statement on Sunday that it had set a tariff range for online car-hailing services of 3,500-6,000 rupiah ($0.26-$0.45) per kilometer for the islands of Java, Bali and Sumatra.  For Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku and Papua, the range is 3,700-6,500 rupiah per kilometer. The regulation kicked in on July 1 and will be evaluated in the next six months, the ministry said.  There has to be a balance between conventional and online transport, so that has to be regulated,  Pudji Hartanto Iskandar, director-general of land transport at the ministry, told Reuters by phone.  The news sent shares of Indonesia's two biggest taxi operators, PT Blue Bird Tbk and PT Express Transindo Utama Tbk, surging on Monday.  An employee of the online ride-hailing service Grab helps a customer to order transport at a kiosk at Manggarai train station in Jakarta, Indonesia July 3, 2017.Agoes RudiantoBy 0340 GMT (11:40 pm ET) , Blue Bird shares jumped as much as 10.7 percent, while Express gained as much as 4.3 percent. The broader Jakarta stock exchange was 0.7 percent higher. Drivers of Blue Bird and Express have called for a ban on ride-hailing services, claiming they were subject to less stringent requirements than conventional taxis. (reut.rs/1RgSf0M) Uber said in an emailed statement it had yet to receive a copy of Indonesia's regulations.  However, we remain committed to working with the government to find a path forward that accommodates the interests of riders and driver partners and supports innovation, competition and customer choice,  Uber said. Grab said it is ready to cooperate with the transport ministry and to comply with regulations.  After receiving direction from the government, we will review the policy and make the necessary adjustments to ensure that our driver-partners will still earn the best incomes when using the Grab platform,  it said in an email.     GO-JEK did not provide an immediate comment. Blue Bird and Express did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The 29-year-old former schoolteacher was awarded a unanimous 12-round decision over the eight-division world champion after a bloody battle in front of more than 51,000 fans at Brisbane's Lang Park on Sunday. Not everybody was happy with the victory, awarded with scores of 117-111, 115-113 and 115-113 by the three judges, and former undisputed world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis was among those who disputed whether Horn should have won.  There's always going to be the backlash where people are going to say I lucky, or whatever,  Horn, his right eye swollen shut, told reporters in Brisbane on Monday.  There's always naysayers saying I didn't win the fight. I think I won the fight, a lot of Queenslanders think I won the fight and people around the world. So you will always have the select few that are against you.  The critics of the decision pointed to the 182 to 92 punch count in favor of the Pacquiao, with some suggesting that Horn was awarded the victory for effort.  This is what's wrong with boxing,  Lewis tweeted.  Horn was a very game but I'm hard pressed to see how he could have won that fight by any stretch!  Pacquiao, whose defeat was his first since his blockbuster clash with Floyd Mayweather Jr in 2005, indicated on Sunday that he would take up the option of a rematch and Horn said he would be delighted to face the 38-year-old in his first title defense.  I'm happy to have a rematch, it'd be good to have him back here fighting,  he added.  Boxing - Manny Pacquiao v Jeff Horn - WBO World Welterweight Title - Brisbane, Australia - July 2, 2017. Jeff Horn of Australia celebrates his win over Manny Pacquiao of the Philippines.    AAP/Dan Peled/via REUTERS Manny Pacquiao is an absolute warrior, he's a legend of this sport. He might have come in underdone, if we have a rematch, if he puts it all in, I don't know...      Horn, whose career record improved to 17-0-1, said he would also like to have a crack at 40-year-old Mayweather, who has come out of retirement for a 12-round crossover bout against mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor.    I hope so,  Horn said.  I'm world champ now. And he has been out of action and coming back to have a fight with Conor McGregor. It will be a good test for him to cement his record in history to fight another boxer for his title.  Boxing - Manny Pacquiao v Jeff Horn - WBO World Welterweight Title - Brisbane, Australia - July 2, 2017. Jeff Horn of Australia punches Manny Pacquiao of the Philippines.   AAP/Dave Hunt/via REUTERSHorn, whose meeting with Pacquiao shattered the Australian attendance record for a fight, said he would prefer to defend his title on home soil and was hoping for a bit more recognition ahead of his next bout.  It was, I guess, the Manny Show,  he said of Sunday's fight.  Even on TV, I can remember watching programs saying the Manny Pacquiao fight in Brisbane.   My name wasn't normally mentioned in those programs, but now hopefully I'm a bit more recognized and I've established myself in the boxing community a bit more.  Horn said he was prepared for the media attention becoming a world champion would bring, and hoped his victory would trigger a renaissance in Australian boxing.  It puts Australian boxing on the map, it's what we've needed for a long time, it's kind of died a bit in the past but hopefully this will invigorate it,  he said.

But Hong Kong stocks started July trading higher, as financials - the biggest beneficiary of the newly-launched  Bond Connect  with China - rose  while small- and mid-caps gained on the back of new Beijing rules letting insurers buy Hong Kong shares via the Shenzhen Connect.

As of June 29, 1,210 Chinese  A-share  firms had issued guidance for interim results for 2017, and 72 percent of those saw earnings growth, according to UBS Securities. Growth guidance was particularly strong in sectors including non-ferrous metals, electronics, property, light manufacturing and chemicals, it said. Although solid earnings help short-term sentiment,  we reiterate our view that earnings growth could slow to 5 percent in H2 and recommend investors to be more defensive,  wrote UBS analyst Gao Ting, who warned that financial regulation will likely remain tough. Echoing concerns about liquidity, OCBC analyst Tommy Xie cautioned that  it may be too early for market to lower the guard against the regulatory tightening as we think financial de-leverage remains top policy priority for China.  He said July will be another important month to monitor given that during it, sizable loans made under the central bank's medium-term lending facility (MLF) will mature. Small-caps outperform blue-chips on Monday, with the SSE 50 Index dropping 0.6 percent, while the start-up board ChiNext was up nearly 1 percent. Financial and consumer stocks fell sharply on profit-taking but commodity shares rose on the back of higher raw material prices triggered by recent dollar weakness. Hong Kong In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index added 0.1 percent, to 25,784.79 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index gained 0.4 percent, to 10,403.57. Index heavyweight HSBC Plc - which on Monday conducted the first deal under the  Bond Connect  - rose nearly 2 percent, while BOC Hong Kong, another beneficiary of the scheme that allows foreign investors to buy China bonds, jumped more than 3 percent. Hong Kong's small-caps and mid-caps rose sharply after Beijing on Friday allowed insurers to buy the city's stocks under the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, potentially boosting demand for smaller companies. But the services index in Hong Kong was down 1.5 percent.

Korea, Taiwan * Energy slide contributed to Indonesia, Malaysia contraction * Growth to continue but moderate into second half By Nichola Saminather SINGAPORE, July 3 (Reuters) - Manufacturing activity in Asia's tech producing economies expanded in June, helped by growing global demand for electronics products, but headwinds in external markets could mean a moderation in growth in the second half of the year. Private sector surveys of manufacturers in Asia showed the factory sectors of China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan picked up in June, driven largely by a recovery in exports. However, continued declines in energy prices, which weighed on manufacturing activity in Indonesia and Malaysia, could hurt these two economies going forward, analysts say. Meanwhile, in India, sluggish domestic demand offset strong foreign demand and led to a manufacturing slowdown in June. Factory Purchasing Managers' Indexes for South Korea, Japan, Taiwan Vietnam and India all remained above the 50-mark that separates contraction from expansion on a monthly basis. And all of these indexes, except for Japan and India, rose from the previous month, indicating an acceleration in expansion.  Overall, the cross above the 50 waterline is not in doubt,  said Vishnu Varathan, Asia head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank's Treasury division.  But the ability for manufacturers to continue to accelerate, or to maintain sharp surges in production, is in question given underlying demand, apart from some bright spots, doesn’t seem to have permeated more widely across the different sectors,  he said. While manufacturing in June expanded at the fastest pace in three months in China, the world's second-largest economy, business confidence slumped to its lowest level this year amid a government crackdown on debt risks and tightening financial conditions.  We believe cyclical momentum (in China) has likely peaked and will ease further due to tighter financial conditions,  Yin Zhang and Helen Qiao, economists at Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong, wrote in a note.  Looking ahead, since overall growth is still higher than the policy target level at around 6.5 percent for real GDP, we expect policy makers to maintain the tightening bias in (the second half), which is likely to impose downward pressure on growth until early 2018.  In Japan, confidence among big manufacturers hit its highest level in over three years in June, according to a survey from the central bank published on Monday. But despite the recovery in some parts of Asia, stubbornly low inflation globally and other economic factors could weigh on the export-dependent region in the second half. The Citi Economic Surprise Index, which moves in tandem with data beating or underclubbing expectations, has plunged for major industrial nations this year and is at negative levels not seen since 2011. And with global debt now standing at a record $217 trillion,  roll over  risks will increase as central banks start raising interest rates, weighing especially on emerging markets that have borrowed in euros and dollars. In southeast Asia, manufacturing in Vietnam was boosted by ramped up production by South Korea's Samsung Electronics . Vietnam's electronics output fell 1 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier on problems with Samsung's Galaxy Note 7, which the company scrapped last year, but recovered in the second quarter. Samsung is Vietnam's biggest foreign investor. Despite the encouraging electronics-driven headline numbers for Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, signs of weakness are showing in other parts of these economies. Household consumption remains sluggish in Japan, job creation in Taiwan was the weakest in 20 months and South Korea's factory output shrank for a 11th straight month and factory employment fell for a 10th.  The larger story seems to be that a moderate recovery continues to be in place,  Mizuho's Varathan said.  But for a virtuous cycle of wider household consumption that leads to a pickup in industries, we still have to wait for few more quarters before that to play out. And that’s the optimistic view.

CMA CGM will retain a 10 percent interest in the Global Gateway South terminal after the deal with funds EQT Infrastructure and its partner P5 Infrastructure, the company said in a statement. The terminal came under CMA CGM's ownership through its 2015 takeover of Singapore's Neptune Orient Lines (NOL), a $2.4 billion deal that marked the Marseille-based group's biggest-ever acquisition. CMA CGM said the sale would help it pay down debts following the NOL takeover and that it was part of its strategy of focusing on shipping. At the time of the NOL takeover, CMA CGM said it aimed to make divestments of $1 billion after reviewing assets. The acquisition of NOL, which operated under the commercial name APL, handed CMA CGM market leadership in trans-Pacific routes, with a strong presence on the U.S. west coast. The NOL acquisition was part of a wider consolidation in the container shipping industry in the midst of a deep downturn in the past few years due to overcapacity and faltering global economic growth. CMA CGM has posted a profit since the end of last year, supported by a recovery in NOL's operating results. BNP Paribas and HSBC acted as financial advisors on the deal, CMA CGM said.

Carige, the country's ninth-biggest bank, has been told by the European Central Bank it needs to raise capital and shed bad loans, but its restructuring has been delayed by a governance spat that led to the appointment of a new chief executive in June. It holds a board meeting to discuss its plans on Monday. With assets of 26 billion euros ($29.7 billion) and a capital gap of 600 million euros, Carige is much less of a headache than the two Veneto-based banks Italy put into liquidation on Sunday in a controversial deal largely funded with taxpayer money. As part of that deal, the government is paying 5.2 billion euros to Intesa Sanpaolo to take on Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca and giving it guarantees for up to 12 billion euros to shield it from any unexpected loss. Rome says the final bill for the state of the Veneto wind-down will be much smaller than feared and it could even end up making a profit over time. But coupled with a 6.6 billion euros state bailout for Monte dei Paschi, which should be finalised in the next month, the funds earmarked for the Veneto banks mean Italy has already potentially used up all of the 20 billion euros it set aside in December to deal with its weakest lenders. Bankers say Italy has finally dealt with its three biggest banking flashpoints, removing a systemic threat that has hung over the whole industry for years.  Things seem to be looking up at last,  the chief executive of a leading Italian bank said, echoing widespread relief within the industry.  Of course there is still a mountain of bad loans, but that is being gradually whittled down. Carige is a problem but it's a lot more manageable than the Veneto banks.  New Boss Heavily exposed to the economy of Italy's north-western Liguria region, Carige has lost nearly 2 billion euros in the past four years because of big loan writedowns and slumping revenues. It appointed former UniCredit's executive Paolo Fiorentino as its new boss on June 21 after the bank's top investor, a local businessman, pushed out his predecessor after just over a year in the job due to a row over how to fix the bank's problems. Three board members have resigned since in disagreement. The upheaval is likely to delay a capital increase that former CEO Guido Bastianini had been pencilled in for this summer - the bank's third cash call since 2014. Carige had a core capital ratio of 10.9 percent at the end of March, below the 11.25 percent minimum threshold set by the ECB. The bank has also been asked by the regulator to halve its gross doubtful loans to 3.7 billion euros by the end of 2019. However unlike the two Veneto lenders, Carige has no immediate liquidity needs. Its liquidity coverage ratio, a measure of a bank's ability to face cash outflows, stood at 119 percent at end-March, above the ECB threshold of 90 percent. Carige announced earlier in June the transfer of 938 million euro of 'sofferenze', the worst kind of bad loans, to a special vehicle that will sell them on repackaged as securities with a state guarantee on the senior tranche. It is not clear whether the bank will proceed with the spin-off of a further 2.4 billion euros in bad loans that Bastianini had been working on.

The sector, estimated by the United Nations to employ at least 8 million Africans, could create millions more jobs across the continent - many for young people and women - to meet a fast growing need for housing and infrastructure, mining experts say. Development minerals refer to materials and minerals that are considered low-value - such as granite, gravel and sand - and are mined, processed, manufactured and used locally in industries from construction and manufacturing to agriculture.  They are significant because the population of Africa is going to keep booming, with many living in urban environments,  Antonio Pedro, the Central Africa director at the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The potential of these minerals for local economies is much higher than for metallic or precious minerals, as entry barriers like research and development, and capital, are lower,  he said. The European Union, the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) nations and the United Nations in 2015 launched a $14 million project to boost the fledgling sector and improve its oversight. But like Africa's big extractive industries - plagued by problems from child labour to poor health and safety standards - the potential of the development mineral sector may be held back by labour and rights abuses unless it is properly regulated.  These commodities (development minerals) aren't going to fuel wars or foul rivers,  said Daniel Franks, manager of the ACP-EU development minerals programme.  Yet there are a large number of labour and health and safety issues which are common throughout the sector ... and child labour is prevalent,  he added. Urbanisation Rising African governments have long been encouraged, or pressured, by multinationals to prioritise the mining of metals for export, which generate quick and big returns for national coffers while allowing authorities to take a back seat, industry experts say.  Governments are extracting the royalties, rather than using them to develop expertise locally or improve the mining sector,  said Gavin Hilson, a professor and the chair of sustainability in business at Britain's University of Surrey.  But there is potentially serious stream of revenue from artisanal and small scale mining if you regulate it and tax it properly.  Decades of neglect have led to poorly designed or implemented policies for small-scale mining, and a lack of rights and support for miners, the United Nations says. But rising urbanisation in Africa could spur governments to breathe new life into the development minerals sector. Half of all Africans will live in cities by 2030, from 36 percent in 2010, according to the World Bank. To cope with population growth, Africa's major cities will need more roads, hospitals and power stations. Around $360 billion in infrastructure investments are needed by 2040 to make the continent competitive and productive, the African Development Bank says. For each billion invested, between 3 and 7 million jobs are created, it estimates. Plunging commodity prices - which saw economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa slump to a two-decade low last year - could also prove a catalyst for the development minerals sector. Nigeria, a major oil producer, is looking to diversify its economy away from a reliance on crude production amid its first recession in 25 years, and small scale mining is on the agenda.  Previously, the government was only interested in tax revenues (from the mining sector),  said Nigerian civil servant and mining official Sam Hart.  Now, productivity comes first.  Constraints In many countries across the continent, informal precious metal and diamond mines are often prey to violence, control and extortion by armed groups, and even the police and military.  But when you open a granite mine, hundreds of people aren't going to come to argue, fight, and demand money,  said Bob Andriamifidy of Progranit, a granite mining firm in Madagascar which has a public project for constructing rural roads. And in a continent with high levels of youth unemployment, the development minerals sector employs many youth and women - estimated to make up over 40 percent of the workforce. To encourage the sector to grow without exploiting its workforce or polluting the environment, the ACP-EU project is working with governments, small mine operators and communities to provide training and boost regulations on health, safety and the environment. While mining experts, officials and operators are quick to hail the promise of development minerals, it could take a long time for that potential to be fulfilled, according to Dirk Willem te Velde of the Overseas Development Institute (ODI).  Institutional constraints are holding back the sector - there are a huge amount of natural resources in the soil across Africa,  said te Velde, senior research fellow at the ODI, a UK-based thinktank.  Good governance and regulations are key.

The move would come after refiner profits on churning out fuel oil from heavy crude hit record highs, with state oil giant Saudi Aramco cutting heavy crude production as part of a drive led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to rein in global output. Saudi Aramco may lift the official selling price (OSP) for Arab Heavy crude to Asia by 20 cents a barrel to $1.65 below the average of Oman and Dubai quotes in August, its narrowest discount since December 2013, according to four Asian crude buyers.  A fifth trade source surveyed by Reuters said the price for the grade would remain unchanged from this month. A hike in prices for Saudi heavy crude could buoy demand for such oil from other Middle Eastern producers, as well as supplies from Russia, Angola and the Americas.  Maybe they (Saudi Aramco) will cut Arab Heavy supplies for August because of the OPEC cut and summer demand for power generation,  said a trader with a North Asian refiner. Tighter heavy crude supplies have reduced fuel oil output and helped push profits on making that product in Asia to an all-time high of a 59 cents premium against Dubai crude on June 22. Meanwhile, the four sources who expected a climb in Saudi heavy crude prices predicted that flagship Arab Light's OSP would fall to a two-month low for August, down 20 cents a barrel after the Dubai market weakened last month. Saudi crude OSPs are usually released around the fifth of each month, and set the trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices, affecting more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude bound for Asia. Saudi Aramco sets its crude prices based on recommendations from customers and after calculating the change in the value of its oil over the past month, based on yields and product prices. Saudi Aramco officials as a matter of policy do not comment on the kingdom's monthly OSPs.

LOUIS -- Bryce Harper wasn't interested in a pitchers' duel between future All-Star teammates. Clouting two-run homers in his first two at-bats against St. Louis Cardinals ace Carlos Martinez, the Nationals right fielder gave his team four quick runs and essentially decided Washington's 7-2 win Sunday night at Busch Stadium. Both homers were off changeups. Harper ripped a 1-2 offering 393 feet into the bleachers in right with Brian Goodwin aboard in the first, then lined an 0-2 pitch at approximately shin level 392 feet to right-center for his 20th homer of the year with Michael A. Taylor aboard in the third. It was the 13th multi-homer game in Harper's career. He could have had a third had he achieved a bit more elevation on a 110 mph liner off his bat that started the ninth. The ball instead hit off center fielder Tommy Pham's glove on the warning track, and Harper settled for a double.  Martinez is really good,  Harper said.  He's an All-Star. You put the bat on the ball and hope he'll supply a bit of the power, and we were able to do it.  Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at CardinalsWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchWhile Washington roughed up Martinez (6-7) for seven hits and five runs over five innings, St. Louis didn't come close to cracking the code on potential National League All-Star starting pitcher Max Scherzer. In seven scoreless innings, Scherzer (10-5) allowed only two hits, singles by Greg Garcia in the first and pinch hitter Luke Voit in the fifth. Scherzer walked two and fanned 12, giving him 163 strikeouts in 120 2/3 innings. Voit's hit was just the 25th by a right-handed batter off Scherzer this year. Scherzer has essentially turned righties into pitchers at the plate, as their average against him is .118.  Guys like he and (Clayton) Kershaw,  said Nationals manager Dusty Baker, referring to the Los Angeles Dodgers' ace left-hander,  this is what they're supposed to do. They're paid handsomely to do it, and they take pride in doing it. They know the team depends on them.  The Nationals (48-34) had lost three in a row entering this one, but it was clear Scherzer wasn't going to let that become four straight. He fanned five of the first six batters he faced and got to 10 before the fifth inning ended. It was Scherzer's 10th double-figure strikeout game of the year and the 59th of his career.  This is the majors; you've got to be up every single night,  he said when asked if being a stopper gave him extra motivation.  Your job is to go out and pitch deep into the game.  After scoring just one run in each of the series' first two games, the Nationals backed up Baker's words that their offense would erupt before leaving town. Anthony Rendon added an RBI double in the third inning, and Wilmer Difo and Goodwin supplied sacrifice flies in the eighth. Pham lined a two-run homer to right-center in the eighth for the Cardinals, who saw a four-game winning streak end and lost for only the second time in eight games. Martinez, who walked four and whiffed three, failed to log a quality start for just the fifth time in 17 outings.  Every type of pitch I would throw, they (made) excellent contact,  he said through an interpreter.  So I have to give credit to them for that.  Washington maintained a 7 1/2-game lead in the NL East on the Atlanta Braves. St. Louis (39-42) remains in third place in the NL Central, 3 1/2 games behind the first-place Milwaukee Brewers. NOTES: Washington 1B Ryan Zimmerman, 2B Daniel Murphy and RF Bryce Harper were chosen starters for the NL All-Star team, which also will include RHPs Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg. C Yadier Molina and RHP Carlos Martinez will represent the Cardinals. ... St. Louis made a pair of minor league trades Sunday based around international cap space. The Cardinals acquired INFs Stanley Espinal and Imeldo Diaz from Boston for cap considerations, then got OF Lane Thomas from Toronto for cap space. ... A ninth-inning run Saturday night allowed the Nationals to remain the only National League team not to be shut out this year. ... The Cardinals signed fourth-round draft pick Kramer Robertson, a shortstop from LSU. Robertson scored a Division I-high 83 runs for the Tigers, who reached the championship round of the College World Series before being bounced by Florida.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-nationals-cardinals-writethru-idUSMTZED73HW5UDJ"},

The South African company is worth $28 billion less than its stake in the Chinese gaming behemoth. Boss Bob van Dijk rules out a spinoff, but that would be the best fix. Unfortunately for would-be activists, supervoting shares make it hard to apply pressure. Fuelled by an early bet on Tencent, the tech and media group has become South Africa's largest public company by market value. The problem is, Naspers' other investments, which span e-commerce in India to online classifieds in Poland, are effectively worth less than nothing to shareholders. As of June 30, the one-third stake in Hong Kong-listed Tencent was worth roughly $113 billion - a third more than Naspers. Graphic: Naspers is worth less than its one third stake in gaming giant Tencent: tmsnrt.rs/2tGMaKc The situation echoes the dilemma at Yahoo, where its core business ended up being worth a lot less than its stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. Yahoo fixed that by selling the internet business to Verizon and rebranding as Altaba.  Naspers’ discount has more than tripled over the past year partly due to Tencent's surging share price. That has prompted some investors to speak out. Last month, a Geneva-based shareholder published an open letter, urging a spinoff, among other things. The company rules out any sale or unbundling of the stake, saying Tencent is  an appreciating asset  that is core to its strategy.  The activist has a point. At best, the market is now applying a big “conglomerate discount” in valuing Naspers. That could prove enduring. At worst, investors are sceptical that the company is creating value with its other businesses. Last month, the company said annual operating losses at its e-commerce division, which includes bets on classifieds, payments and food delivery, widened to $682 million from $648 million. Smaller pay-television and media arms also disappointed, as operating profit slumped by over one-third.     Unfortunately, supervoting shares account for 68 percent of votes at Naspers, recent filings show. It is not clear who ultimately owns these shares. But if these owners support management, it can easily continue to be dismissive.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Millions of workers from poor neighbours, such as Cambodia and Myanmar, form the backbone of Thailand's manual labour force, with industries such as the multi-billion-dollar seafood business heavily reliant on foreign workers. Since taking power in a 2014 coup, Thailand's ruling junta has attained varying degrees of success in campaigns to regulate the foreign workforce, spurred partly by media reports that unregulated workers faced exploitation by employers. About 60,000 workers left between June 23 and 28, and the number has risen since, an Immigration Bureau official said.  They were of all nationalities, but the biggest group was from Myanmar,  Deputy Commissioner Pornchai Kuntee told Reuters.  They are probably very scared.  Following news of the exodus, Thailand on Friday promised a 120-day delay in enforcing parts of the decree, including fines that can range up to 800,000 baht ($23,557) for employers who hire unregistered foreign workers without permits. Geta Devi, 28, a Myanmar worker based in Bangkok, the Thai capital, said some of her friends panicked after hearing about the decree.  They went back to Myanmar,  she added. The mass movement leaves undocumented workers vulnerable, said Andy Hall, a British specialist in migrant workers' rights who has monitored such migration in Thailand for more than a decade.  It's clear to me tens of thousands of migrants only move like this after instigation,  Hall, who has worked extensively with Myanmar workers, told Reuters. Despite the threat of punishment,  corrupt officials  would try to take bribes from fleeing migrants, he said.  Mass profit is to be made in a short time from the panic and commotion,  Hall added. Police officers who try to extort money from employers or migrant workers will be punished, Thai police chief Chaktip Chaijinda said on Friday, in a bid to discourage exploitation of undocumented workers. Last month, the United States kept Thailand on a trafficking watch list, saying it did not meet the minimum standards to end human trafficking. Thailand defended its efforts to stop trafficking and urged U.S. officials to visit and gauge its campaign. More than 3 million migrants work in Thailand, the International Organization for Migration has said, but rights groups put the figure higher.

The Reserve Bank of India said late on Friday it will sell 100 billion rupees ($1.55 billion) of government bonds on Thursday. The new 10-year bond jumped as much as 11 basis points to 6.62 percent in early trade, its highest level since June 7, from its close of 6.51 percent. Traders said the timing of the open market sale was a surprise as markets had expected it to happen in August to coincide with the time when the RBI must pay a hefty dividend to the government. The RBI has so far resorted to selling short-end securities through a special scheme to drain out some of the excess cash, a method that was seen as less disruptive.

Regulators and market participants argue the agencies were slow to adjust ratings of some companies that defaulted. Each of the big three global agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service - are majority owners of firms in India which operate independently of their parent companies with different rating standards. Under existing rules, ratings agencies operating in India are already required to  continuously monitor  the securities they rate and disseminate any changes  promptly.  But the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulator said they would henceforth have to track whether debt issuers were meeting payments for each rated instrument and be alert for any deterioration of financial conditions. Credit agencies would also need to review ratings after every  material event  and request monthly  no default statements  from issuers, SEBI added. SEBI has threatened to impose tougher rules since the agencies were perceived to have responded slowly to changing conditions in several companies that defaulted, including Amtek Auto. Shriram Subramanian, founder of shareholder advisory firm InGovern, said the rules would put the onus on agencies to more closely supervise the ratings they assigned.  These new guidelines makes it obligatory for rating agencies to provide closer monitoring,  he said, noting they would also encourage issuers to be  more transparent  with the agencies.

Ride-hailing services such as U.S. group Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Southeast Asia's Grab and Indonesia's GO-JEK have heavily subsidized their drivers in Indonesia in order to gain market share in the country of 250 million people, analysts say. The transport ministry said in a statement on Sunday that it had set a tariff range for online car-hailing services of 3,500-6,000 rupiah ($0.26-$0.45) per kilometer for the islands of Java, Bali and Sumatra.  For Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku and Papua, the range is 3,700-6,500 rupiah per kilometer. The regulation kicked in on July 1 and will be evaluated in the next six months, the ministry said.  There has to be a balance between conventional and online transport, so that has to be regulated,  Pudji Hartanto Iskandar, director-general of land transport at the ministry, told Reuters by phone.  The news sent shares of Indonesia's two biggest taxi operators, PT Blue Bird Tbk and PT Express Transindo Utama Tbk, surging on Monday.

The broader Jakarta stock exchange was 0.7 percent higher. Drivers of Blue Bird and Express have called for a ban on ride-hailing services, claiming they were subject to less stringent requirements than conventional taxis. (reut.rs/1RgSf0M) Uber said in an emailed statement it had yet to receive a copy of Indonesia's regulations.  However, we remain committed to working with the government to find a path forward that accommodates the interests of riders and driver partners and supports innovation, competition and customer choice,  Uber said. Grab said it is ready to cooperate with the transport ministry and to comply with regulations.  After receiving direction from the government, we will review the policy and make the necessary adjustments to ensure that our driver-partners will still earn the best incomes when using the Grab platform,  it said in an email.     GO-JEK did not provide an immediate comment. Blue Bird and Express did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Australian shares fell 1.7 percent on Friday, recording their biggest percentage fall since November 2016, in broad-based sell-off, following a slump on Wall Street. However, the S&P;/ASX 200 index rose slightly by 1.306 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,722.8 by 0315 GMT on Monday.  The market is fairly soft today and the volumes are low. Looks like we have been hit by some top-ten selling, that is selling of futures, which is weighing on the market,  said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, referring to ten largest companies in the index. Financials drove the gains on the benchmark with Westpac , Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Australia New Zealand Banking Group all in the black. Sentiment was boosted by a survey that showed that Australia's manufacturing and service sectors both enjoyed strong activity in June with upbeat demand encouraging more hiring. Meanwhile, the energy sector was among the biggest gainers on the benchmark after oil prices edged up on Monday, supported by the first fall in U.S. drilling activity in months, although rising output from OPEC despite a pledge to cut supplies capped gains. Oil producer Santos Ltd was up 0.8 percent while Beach Energy Ltd jumped 3.5 percent. In other stocks, Australia's biggest retailer by sales Wesfarmers Ltd climbed 1 percent. The Healthcare sector was the biggest drag on the index, with biotech firm CSL Ltd slipping more than 1 percent.  CSL is just pulling back from an all-time record high, so its not unusual to see a little bit of correction in it,  McCarthy added. Real estate stocks also weighed on the benchmark with Scentre Group and Stockland Corp Ltd slipping more than 1 percent each. Home prices in Australia's major cities rebounded in June after a pullback the month before, but there were early signs the market was cooling as regulators tightened the screws on leveraged property investors. Among the other big losers was Fairfax Media, which slumped as much as 16.8 percent to a near-four month low after it said it had ceased discussions with two U.S private equity suitors, undermining investor expectations for a bidding war for Australia's oldest newspaper publisher. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index edged 0.1 percent or 4.32 points lower to 7,607.12. Fisher Paykel & Healthcare accounted for most of the losses, falling about 1 percent. Ebos Group and Chorus Ltd were the other major losers on the index, shedding 1.6 percent and 1.2 percent respectively.
