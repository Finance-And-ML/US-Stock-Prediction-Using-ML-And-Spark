[{"content": "A defamation lawsuit filed against President Donald Trump by a onetime \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d contestant shouldn\u2019t proceed while he is in office, attorneys for the president said Friday in a motion seeking to dismiss the case.The motion, filed late Friday in New York state court, based its arguments on the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, which establishes that the constitution and federal laws hold primacy over state laws. The clause bars the state court from handling the lawsuit, brought by restaurateur Summer Zervos, the motion stated.Allowing the case to continue poses \u201csignificant risk that this action will interfere with the President\u2019s executive responsibilities to the detriment of the public,\u201d according to the motion.Ms. Zervos sued Mr. Trump for defamation in January, saying he denigrated her on the campaign trail after she publicly claimed he made unwanted sexual advances. In a press conference last fall, Ms. Zervos accused Mr. Trump of kissing and touching her without her permission during two meetings in 2007.Gloria Allred,        who represents Ms. Zervos, had no immediate comment Friday. She has previously said that no man is above the law, including the president.Mr. Trump\u2019s motion stated state governments and courts must \u201crefrain from interfering in the operations of the federal government,\u201d which this lawsuit would do. The motion left open the possibility that the case could be brought in federal court\u2014citing the sexual-harassment complaint that the Supreme Court allowed to proceed in federal court against President       Bill Clinton       brought by former Arkansas state employee       Paula Jones      \u2014but said even that must wait until after the presidency.Regardless of the venue, the motion said, the lawsuit should be dismissed because Ms. Zervos failed to show anything defamatory was said about her. The dismissal motion was filed by private attorney       Marc Kasowitz,        who is also representing Mr. Trump in the probe of alleged Russian meddling in the presidential race.In her lawsuit, Ms. Zervos detailed a series of tweets and public statements in which Mr. Trump sought to distance himself from Ms. Zervos and other women who raised allegations of inappropriate behavior. \u201cEvery woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign, total fabrication,\u201d he said at an October rally in Gettysburg, Pa., according to Ms. Zervos\u2019 complaint.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers said most of the tweets and remarks mentioned in the suit aren\u2019t directed at Ms. Zervos, with the exception of one, nondefamatory statement that \u201cI never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. That is not who I am as a\u00a0person, and it is not how I\u2019ve conducted my life.\u201dThe comments made during the campaign, the lawyers said, also can\u2019t be considered defamatory because they are \u201cpart of the expected fiery rhetoric, hyperbole and opinion that is squarely protected by the First Amendment.\u201d And tweets where he simply retweeted someone else\u2019s opinion, adding a few-word commentary, can\u2019t be held against him, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers said.The president\u2019s motion also asserted that the suit, which claims less than $3,000 in damages, failed to state a cause of action and that it should be dismissed under a California statute that protects petition and free-speech rights.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers said in March that they planned to file the motion to dismiss.Write to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 23:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/president-trumps-lawyers-file-motion-to-dismiss-apprentice-lawsuit-1499485448", "news_title": "President Trump\u2019s Lawyers File Motion to Dismiss \u2018Apprentice\u2019 Lawsuit ", "keywords": "defamation, donald trump, motion to dismiss, the apprentice, trump's sexual advances,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "CAIRO\u2014Vehicles packed with explosives blew up at military checkpoints in Egypt\u2019s northeastern Sinai on Friday in deadly, apparently orchestrated, attacks that could intensify criticism of President       Abdel Fattah Al Sisi.Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks that killed at least 23 soldiers on the edge of the city of Rafah, near Egypt\u2019s border with Israel and the Gaza Strip, the Associated Press reported.An army spokesman said government forces killed 40 militants who were trying to carry out attacks on other military checkpoints.A high-ranking special-forces officer was among the dead, local media reported.Mr. Sisi swept to power in a 2013 military coup, promising a government that would be a bulwark against terrorism, both at home and in the region.Since then, however, government forces have been mired in a prolonged war against Sinai Peninsula, local branch of the fundamentalist Muslim militant group Islamic State. In October, the group\u2019s fighters, traveling in a sport-utility vehicle, opened fire on a checkpoint in Sinai, killing 12 soldiers.This and other recent terrorist attacks, especially against Egypt\u2019s minority Coptic Christian community, have deepened doubts that Mr. Sisi\u2019s administration can defeat the militants.Islamic State\u2019s local branch said it carried out the suicide bombing in the Coptic cathedral in the heart of Cairo in December that killed 28 worshipers. It also asserted responsibility for attacks on Coptic churches in Alexandria and Ismailia in April that killed 45 Copts.Following that bloodshed, the government imposed a nationwide state of emergency, expanding a similar edict that had been in place in Sinai since October 2014.

Around the same date, the complaint said, the firm released research and videos promoting the confirmation of Mr. Price and other cabinet nominees in the Senate. Mr. Price was the only cabinet nominee to use campaign funds to pay the firm, according to the complaint.Some of the materials the firm released specifically urged senators to vote for Mr. Price\u2019s confirmation, the Campaign Legal Center said in its complaint.A spokesman for Mr. Price at the Department of Health and Human Services didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. America Rising also didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Mr. Price was nominated to the Health and Human Services post on Nov. 29 and confirmed on Feb. 10. According to Mr. Price\u2019s filing with the FEC, he charged the campaign account multiple times through the end of March to pay for airfare and consulting fees and to host events. Another of Mr. Price\u2019s filings with the FEC includes the payment to America Rising.Campaign-finance laws prohibit members of Congress from using their campaign funds for personal gain.Mr. Price\u2019s confirmation process was contentious.

But the festival proved to be a flop when attendees, some of whom paid thousands of dollars, arrived at the private party venue only to find a half-built festival ground, bad food and canceled musical acts.The festival was quickly postponed and photos of festival attendees stranded on the island went viral on social media. Now lenders are hoping bankruptcy can help them figure out what happened to their money and if they can get any of it back.\u201cWe look forward to finding out where the money went,\u201d said       Robert Knuts,        a lawyer at Sher Tremonte LLP, who filed a petition Friday in New York against Fyre Festival LLC on behalf of three lenders who sunk $530,000 into the event. Mr. Knuts said they are part of a larger group of more than 20 individuals who together lent more than $4 million to Fyre Festival.Through bankruptcy, these lenders hope to install an independent trustee who would have the ability to examine Fyre Festival\u2019s records, Mr. Knuts said. A trustee would also be able to claw back payments the company may have made to other creditors and figure out if there are any sources of recovery, potentially through insurance.Mr. McFarland, 25 years old, is the founder of Fyre Media, a company that developed a digital application to book artists and entertainers. He established Fyre Festival LLC in late 2016 to promote the music festival, court papers say. People overseeing Fyre Festival could challenge the attempt to force a bankruptcy. They have 21 days to respond to the bankruptcy petition.Randall W. Jackson,        a Boies Schiller Flexner LLP lawyer representing Mr. McFarland in the criminal case, declined to comment.       Michael Levine,        a lawyer who is representing Mr. McFarland in a separate civil lawsuit brought by a Fyre Festival investor, also declined to comment, saying in an email that he hadn\u2019t been aware of the petition and hadn\u2019t had time to review it.In the three months since Fyre Festival went aground, lawsuits have been filed against Mr. McFarland and his partner, rapper Ja Rule, by vendors, investors, and concertgoers, some of whom paid as much as $250,000 to attend. The festival was expected to feature performances by bands including Blink 182 and promised concertgoers a luxurious experience that didn\u2019t materialize.Mr. McFarland was arrested last week on a fraud charge and released on bail. Authorities allege Mr. McFarland misrepresented Fyre Media\u2019s revenue and his own finances to investors. According to a criminal complaint, Mr. McFarland allegedly used false information to get at least two investors to invest $1.2 million into his business.If convicted, Mr. McFarland faces up to 20 years in prison.\u2014Nicole Hong contributed to this article.Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 19:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lenders-seek-to-force-fyre-festival-into-bankruptcy-1499471926", "news_title": "Lenders Seek to Force Fyre Festival Into Bankruptcy", "keywords": "bankruptcynews, billy mcfarland,fraud,fyre festival, ja rule, william mcfarland,Fyre Festival,corporate crime,legal action,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,political,general news,arts,entertainment,festivals,music"}, {"content": "HAMBURG\u2014Coming face-to-face in a highly anticipated meeting, the American and Russian presidents disagreed Friday over election interference and about the best approach to North Korea, but made tentative progress toward curbing the bloodshed in Syria\u2019s long-running war.President       Donald Trump       and Russia\u2019s       Vladimir Putin       spoke for more than two hours Friday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 leading nations summit in Germany. The meeting went so much longer than planned that first lady Melania Trump looked in at one point to see if she could coax them to wrap up.It didn\u2019t work. They kept talking another hour.\u201cIt was an extraordinarily important meeting\u2014so much for us to talk about,\u201d Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson,        who was in the room, told reporters afterward. \u201cAnd it was a good start.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s interest lay not only in speaking in detail with the Russian leader, but also in trying to shape the narrative that emerged about the meeting. Toward that end, Mr. Tillerson provided a round-by-round account of the conversation, answering questions from reporters about a spectrum of international issues.The first issue raised by Mr. Trump was one that has vexed him most at home: whether Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential race to help him win. Before Friday, it was far from clear Mr. Trump would mention it at all. As recently as the day before, Mr. Trump cast doubt on the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia interfered in the election and was prepared to do it again.\u201cNo one really knows for sure,\u201d Mr. Trump said.In private, however, the president told Mr. Putin that Americans are upset about Russia\u2019s actions and want them to stop, Mr. Tillerson said. The president invoked a bill passed 98-2 by the Senate last month that would slap new sanctions on Russia in reprisal. The measure is now pending in the House.Mr. Trump\u2019s message: Russia could pay a higher price unless it keeps out of America\u2019s democratic elections, Mr. Tillerson said.\u201cThe president pressed President Putin on more than one occasion regarding Russian involvement,\u201d Mr. Tillerson recounted.Mr. Putin denied that Russia played a role. With the two men at odds, they agreed they wouldn\u2019t let the issue poison the overall relationship between their countries.The U.S. will try to wrest a commitment from Russia not to interfere in future elections in the U.S. and elsewhere, Mr. Tillerson said. He conceded, though, \u201cmore work can be done in that regard.\u201d\u201cThe relationship is too important to not find a way to move forward,\u201d the secretary of state added.In advance of the two leaders\u2019 first-ever sit-down, lawmakers from both parties called on the president to make plain the U.S. won\u2019t tolerate more Russian campaign mischief.After seeing reports of the meeting, some said they weren\u2019t reassured.\u201cWhatever the president actually told Putin, it would have had much more force if, just the day before, President Trump had not equivocated about who was behind the unprecedented attack targeting America last fall,\u201d said Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat and the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee. The panel is probing the topic of Russian interference in the 2016 election.Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate Democratic leader, said in a             Twitter                   message: \u201cWorking to compromise the integrity of our elections cannot & should not be an area where \u2018agree to disagree\u2019 is an acceptable conclusion.\u201dRussia\u2019s account of the exchange differed from that of the Americans. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who was also in the meeting, told reporters afterward that said Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s contention that Russia didn\u2019t interfere in the campaign.Mr. Tillerson said that, generally, Mr. Trump didn\u2019t want to \u201crelitigate\u201d the past with Mr. Putin and was eager not to let the election issue doom the broader relationship between the two countries.In a May meeting in the Oval Office with Mr. Lavrov, Mr. Trump failed to bring up the election in a substantive way. At the time, a White House official said \u201cthe issue was referenced but there was no substantive discussion.\u201d Mr. Lavrov, speaking at a press conference after the Oval Office meeting, said \u201cneither of us touched on this bacchanalia.\u201dThe two sides made more headway Friday on Syria. As the meeting played out, officials confirmed that the U.S. and Russia had agreed on a cease-fire in southwest Syria. The sides had been meeting quietly over the past months to see if they could ratchet down the fighting in that part of Syria.Messrs. Putin and Trump spent considerable time talking about the Syrian war and would try to end the fighting in more swaths of the country, Mr. Tillerson said. The U.S. backs rebel groups opposing Syria\u2019s government and Russia backs Syrian leader       Bashar al-Assad       and has Iran and Iranian-backed militias as allies.He added the Trump administration would like Russia\u2019s help in doing away with North Korea\u2019s nuclear missile program, an escalating threat to the U.S. homeland.Mr. Tillerson said that while Russia also wants to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons, it doesn\u2019t share the U.S.\u2019s urgency. He said Russia has \u201csome economic activity\u201d with North Korea, adding that \u201cwe\u2019re going to continue these discussions and ask them to do more.\u201dAhead of Friday\u2019s meeting, the State Department announced that Mr. Tillerson has tapped Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to be a special envoy for Ukraine negotiations.Mr. Tillerson later told reporters the appointment was at the request of Mr. Putin. Mr. Tillerson has floated the possibility of a solution to the crisis outside of international agreements reached in Minsk in recent years. Mr. Volker is tasked with advancing the objectives of the cease-fire agreement, which has never fully taken hold.No other meetings between Messrs. Putin and Trump have been planned. But the U.S. came away from this one convinced that the dialogue is in a better place. Just three months ago, Mr. Trump said at a news conference that relations between the two countries \u201cmay be at an all-time low.\u201d\u201cThe two leaders I would say connected very quickly,\u201d Mr. Tillerson added. \u201cThere was a very clear positive chemistry between the two.\u201d\u2014Felicia Schwartz, Paul Sonne, and Byron Tau contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comAppeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 19:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-putin-shake-hands-in-first-face-to-face-meeting-1499423683", "news_title": "Trump, Putin Spar on Hacks, Act on Syria", "keywords": "north korea nuclear,russia u.s.,trump putin,Donald Trump,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Sears Holdings Corp.        SHLD -3.66%       said Friday it will close 43 additional stores as it works to cut costs and better match changing consumer behavior with its brick-and-mortar strategy.The Sears and Kmart parent will shutter eight Sears stores and 35 Kmart stores that are unprofitable by October, said Chief Executive       Eddie Lampert       in a blog post on Sears\u2019s corporate website. Earlier this year, the company said it planned to close 150 Sears and Kmart stores.Sears Holdings operated 1,275 Kmart, Sears and specialty stores as of April 29.The company also said it would reduce the size of several less-competitive stores, a strategy in line with the company\u2019s recently opened smaller-format stores that focus on appliances.On Friday, Sears said it sold more than $200 million of real estate in June, which allowed it to pay down debt and gives it the ability to raise up $1 billion in its asset-backed loan facility maturing in 2020.In addition, Sears said it had amended the terms of a credit line to allow its subsidiaries to borrow up to $500 million. The loans, backed by Sears\u2019s property, would have to be paid back within about six months. Mr. Lampert controls the agent under the credit facility.

The unemployment rate touched a 16-year low in May and the number of job openings hit a record earlier this year.Still, average hourly earnings for private-sector workers rose slightly in June, 2.5% compared with a year earlier, a level little changed since March. As recently as December, the figure was 2.9% and in the months before the recession, wage gains consistently topped 3%.Since mid-2009, when the expansion started, hourly earnings of blue-collar workers\u2014for which long-run data series are available\u2014have grown on average 2.2% a year, much less than the 3% expansion of the 2000s, the 3.2% expansion of the 1990s or the 3.3% expansion of the 1980s.Tepid wage growth is a puzzle because worker incomes should in theory rise faster as employers compete for scarce labor, though some economists say broader economic forces are at work.\u201cWith both productivity growth and inflation continuing to prove sluggish, it is not altogether surprising that wage growth has disappointed,\u201d said       John E. Silvia,        chief economist at Wells Fargo.Economists have advanced many explanations for the trend. A more globalized economy is holding down what workers can earn everywhere, especially in rich countries losing manufacturing jobs to low-wage economies. The reduced power of unions has impeded the bargaining power of workers. People are more easily replaced by machines or individuals sitting on the sidelines of the labor force waiting to return.The burdens of slow wage growth, importantly, are softened for workers by the fact that inflation is low. Inflation-adjusted wage growth for blue-collar workers, at 0.7% a year in this expansion, is actually better than in any of the three previous expansions, and wages by this measure have grown for 49 straight months.In the U.S. and elsewhere, central bankers have said wages could heat up soon. That is in part because more employers say they are struggling to find workers, which could lead to more bargaining power for workers.Bryan Health, a Lincoln, Neb., nonprofit hospital network, has about 200 job openings this month, including entry-level cafeteria workers, janitors, clinicians, nurses and other medical specialists. Trouble filling the openings is a potential check on its growth, according to Jan Garvin, Bryan\u2019s vice president for human resources.\u201cWe\u2019re a little stymied by the lack of available talent,\u201d said Ms. Garvin.The hospital system is looking at new ways to staff areas with acute shortages, such as respiratory therapy. It plans to pilot a program this fall that pays full tuition plus a stipend or supplemental wages to employees who want to complete a two-year degree in the field.Bryan boosted the pay of most workers 3% this year\u2014some areas with high demand received a 4.5% raise\u2014and is weighing a higher wage floor, now set at $11 an hour.Improving opportunities in the job market appear to be slowly pulling Americans off the economy\u2019s sidelines. The labor-force participation rate, hovering near a four-decade low, inched up to 62.8% in June from 62.7% the prior month. The rate measures the share of the population age 16 and older either working or looking for a job.Low participation is partly because of shifts at both ends of the workforce age spectrum\u2014fewer young Americans are looking for work and baby boomers are retiring. Among prime-age workers, those 25-54 years old, participation bottomed out in September 2015 and has been gradually trending higher. Job-market participation remains below its level just before the recession, suggesting there could be room for further growth.That represents a potential untapped source of labor for employers like Bryan Health. It also suggests a continued weight on wages in the form of hidden labor supply.There are other explanations for soft wage gains. Economists point to low worker-productivity growth, which limits the ability of firms to raise pay without eating into profits. Companies may also be hunting out cheaper workers\u2014either younger or less skilled ones\u2014rather than competing solely on wages.\u201cOne alternative is to substitute away from perfectly qualified candidates and start looking at people who are a little less experienced, people who can be trained up,\u201d said Cathy Barrera, chief economic adviser for job-search site ZipRecruiter.Signs of steady hiring are helping to give some workers confidence to take risks.Christal Brown decided to leave Mattress Firm, the Houston-based retailer where she worked for 18 years, rather than take a new role she felt didn\u2019t fit her skills. Her last day was June 1. Ms. Brown, 44 and most recently the vice president of human resources, said she is confident she will find a new job in the coming months without having to relocate from her home in Houston. She already has landed a few interviews and hopes to find another role.\u201cI thought this was a good time to see what was out there to help me grow professionally,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are definitely jobs out there.\u201dOpportunism like that has been in short supply through much of this slow expansion.Largely in response to broad improvements across the labor market, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates last month for the third time since December. Officials penciled in one more increase for this year, and appeared to reach consensus on how to gradually reduce the Fed\u2019s $4.5 trillion asset portfolio, moves that could lead long-term rates to rise.\u201cToday\u2019s report will keep the Federal Reserve on the path of gradually raising interest rates,\u201d said       Gus Faucher,        chief economist at             PNC Financial Services.Write to Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@wsj.comAppeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'Jobs Grow, but Wages Stay Stuck.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 18:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-adds-a-robust-222-000-jobs-in-june-1499430803", "news_title": "U.S. Jobs Growth Picks Up, but Wage Gains Lag Behind ", "keywords": " average hourly earnings, average workweek, government payrolls, labor participation rate, nonfarm payrolls, private sector payrolls, u.s. economic expansion,u.s. jobs report, unemployment,labor,personnel,economic performance,indicators,employment,unemployment,economic news,political,general news,general labor issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,labor department"}, {"content": "MELBOURNE, Australia\u2014            Tesla Inc.        TSLA -0.91%       Chief Executive       Elon Musk       has agreed to build the world\u2019s largest lithium-ion battery system in Australia, a bid to showcase the technology\u2019s potential but one that raises questions about the company\u2019s focus on ramping up production of its Model 3 sedan.The plan, revealed Friday, is to build a 100-megawatt storage system in the state of South Australia, which has been hit by a string of blackouts over the past year. The system will collect power generated by a wind farm built by French energy company Neoen.Mr. Musk said the project will be three times more powerful than any other battery system in the world. He pledged to complete it within 100 days of signing an agreement or it would be free.\u201cThis is not a minor foray into the frontier, this is like going three times further than anyone has gone before,\u201d Mr. Musk said.The Silicon Valley auto maker didn\u2019t detail how it plans to handle the ambitious goals of meeting the needs of battery packs for Australia while also scaling up battery production for the Model 3 at its new giant battery factory in Nevada.Dennis Virag,        a manufacturing consultant who has worked in the automotive industry for 40 years, said the move is concerning. \u201cYou can plan as well as you want but there\u2019s always going to be a hiccup along the line,\u201d he said.Analysts, pointing to Tesla\u2019s quick deployment of a large battery array in Southern California, said there is little doubt Tesla can manufacture batteries off-site and plug them into the grid in 100 days.The risk, though, is Tesla can\u2019t do both projects fast enough and will have to prioritize one over the other, said David Whiston, an analyst for Morningstar Research. \u201cGiven the pledge to finish the Australia project in 100 days, the auto business would suffer in that scenario,\u201d he said.Production issues around the battery pack led to a shortfall of supply for Tesla during the second quarter, hindering sales, the company said Monday. It has declined to discuss the details, saying the issue was resolved in June. Mr. Musk this week also revealed a dramatically slower ramp up of the Model 3 than he previously had suggested suppliers should prepare for.Tesla said Friday the issues that caused the battery-pack shortfall, which affected certain Model S and Model X vehicles, aren\u2019t a factor for the Australia project or the Model 3. While Mr. Musk earlier in the day acknowledged the risks of building the Australian system on a large scale, the company said it is confident it can \u201cmeet delivery dates for our concurrent vehicle and global energy storage projects.\u201dThe project is strategic for Tesla, given many of the battery-storage facilities built to-date have been pilot projects, said Shayle Kann, head of clean-energy consultancy GTM Research. The firm estimates the installation would require about 500 to 600 of Tesla\u2019s Powerpacks, and would cost roughly $80 million.Tesla was selected from more than 90 bids to build a storage system for the state, said South Australia Premier       Jay Weatherill.       The value of the project wasn\u2019t disclosed.The origins of the deal trace back to a Twitter exchange in March between Mr. Musk and local entrepreneur       Mike Cannon-Brookes,        which led to conversations between Mr. Musk and Mr. Weatherill and Australian Prime Minister       Malcolm Turnbull.South Australia has turned increasingly toward renewable power sources\u2014it relies on solar and wind generation for about 40% of its electricity\u2014but has been vulnerable to shortages because of a lack of storage capacity. A powerful storm last year caused a statewide blackout that left homes and businesses without power for several days. The state was hit with more blackouts early this year as soaring temperatures pushed up demand for power.The Tesla battery system will provide stability to the power system and should lead to lower prices for consumers, Mr. Weatherill said.The 129 megawatt-hour project will provide enough power for more than 30,000 homes, about equal to the number of homes that lost power during the blackouts, Tesla said.\u2018This is not a minor foray into the frontier, this is like going three times further than anyone has gone before\u2019Ian Lowe,        emeritus professor of science, technology and society at Griffith University in Queensland, said the storage system won\u2019t by itself allow South Australia to have reliable energy just from wind and solar but it would be an important step.The value of the battery system is in making the power produced by wind easier to dispatch and therefore more profitable, said Geoff James, research principal at University of Technology Sydney\u2019s Institute for Sustainable Futures.Once the project is completed, which Tesla expects will happen by the start of the Australian summer in December, it will be larger than a storage facility in the Southern California desert also built on Tesla batteries. GTM forecasts the market for grid-energy storage in the U.S. will reach $3 billion by the beginning of the next decade, up from $320 million last year.\u2014Erin Ailworth contributed to this article.Write to Robb M.

The agreement that fell out of the Hamburg bilateral was the announcement of a cease-fire in southwestern Syria.Any cessation of hostilities in Syria is welcome, and we can hope it will become the basis for similar agreements on the country\u2019s more complex northern war fronts. But that would require Mr. Putin to abandon his grand strategy for re-establishing Russian influence across the Middle East, in partnership with Iran and Syria. That would take a real summit and more planning than went into the Hamburg sit-down.Messrs. Trump and Putin brought only their foreign ministers into the meeting, suggesting that the primary goal here was to take each other\u2019s measure. Both men famously pride themselves in their ability to size up adversaries\u2014Mr. Trump as a negotiator of real-estate deals and Mr. Putin as a former KGB recruiter of foreign agents.The American and Russian sides also bring distinctly different intentions into meetings like this one. For the American side, prodded by an insistent media narrative, the goal is to discover areas of possible \u201ccooperation.\u201d In Mr. Putin\u2019s world, such a meeting has one purpose: to discover if he will be able to press Russian interests forward without significant pushback from the U.S. President.Mr. Putin concluded that       Barack Obama       would pose minimal resistance, and so he seized Crimea, invaded eastern Ukraine and adopted Syria\u2019s       Bashar Assad.       He\u2019s still in all three places.We can\u2019t guess what Mr. Putin made of       Donald       Trump. Mr. Trump for his part enjoys his reputation for unpredictability, and he confirmed this by pressing Mr. Putin on Russia\u2019s efforts to disrupt the U.S. presidential election. Mr. Putin denied any meddling, but the Russian now has a new element in the Trump equation to think about.Until now, Mr. Trump has let the Russian leader believe their dealings might be man-to-man. But by raising Russian interference in a U.S. election, Mr. Trump made clear to Vlad that he\u2019ll be dealing with the President of all the American people. That sounds like a positive outcome.Appeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 18:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-donald-met-vlad-1499467095", "news_title": "When Donald Met Vlad", "keywords": "political,general news,international relations,politics,editorials"}, {"content": "Few politicians have acquitted themselves well in the health-care debate, but no one has dumped his former principles harder than       John Kasich.       Ohio\u2019s Republican Governor has emerged as the media\u2019s go-to source for substance-free lectures opposing Medicaid reform, and this debate could use a fact or two, not least about Ohio.\u201cIf you cut $750 billion out of Medicaid, and in the out-years you basically starve the program, we have to choose between children, seniors, the disabled, the addicted, the mentally ill,\u201d Mr. Kasich told ABC\u2019s       Martha Raddatz       last weekend. He added, repeatedly, that the GOP has refused to \u201cput the country first.\u201dPresumably this accusation of being unpatriotic extends to the Republicans who control the Ohio state legislature, who recently voted 59-40 in the House and 24-8 in the Senate to freeze Medicaid enrollment after 2018 amid exploding costs. The freeze applies only to the Medicaid expansion population\u2014able-bodied, childless adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level.This cost-control measure was necessary because enrollment in new Medicaid has reached 725,000, well above the Kasich Administration\u2019s prediction of 447,000 when the Governor bypassed the legislature and unilaterally expanded Medicaid under ObamaCare in 2013. One of four Ohioans is now on the program. Mr. Kasich line-item-vetoed the legislature\u2019s freeze, invoking drug abusers. Though the freeze explicitly exempted people in need of mental health or addiction treatment, the legislature failed to override the veto on Thursday.The irony is that the Medicaid expansion diverts resources from the program\u2019s traditional targets. The federal government pays an original \u201cmatch rate\u201d of 62.8% in Ohio but pays 96% for new ObamaCare Medicaid beneficiaries. This means that adults not in poverty are worth more to the state than, say, the developmentally and intellectually disabled.Sure enough, in 2015 Ohio redesigned its disability determination system to remove some 34,000 people from the safety-net rolls. Nearly 60,000 disabled Ohioans are on waiting lists that last for months or years to receive supplemental state services. A temporary enrollment freeze might lead Ohio to prioritize resources for the truly needy.Despite this history, Mr. Kasich ran for President in 2016 as a fiscal conservative. On the campaign trail the man who chaired the House Budget Committee in the 1990s lugged a large electronic debt clock that showed what U.S. taxpayers owe to every town hall.According to his 2016 \u201cKasich Action Plan,\u201d entitlements are \u201cgrowing uncontrollably and must be fundamentally reformed to reduce their growth rates and become more efficient while still providing the services that Americans want and need.\u201d On Medicaid Mr. Kasich said \u201cper-member per-month allocations to the states, along with the flexibility to innovate and tailor their programs to their individual health care markets, can help hold Medicaid\u2019s spending growth to 3 percent annually.\u201dThat is precisely what the Senate bill does\u2014except it is more generous. While ending Medicaid\u2019s status as an open-ended entitlement, its block-grant replacement grows at 3.7% over the next decade, or the rate of medical inflation, on a per-member per-month (PMPM) basis. It shifts to the regular consumer price index (2.4% today) in 2026, which some Senators and apparently Mr. Kasich believe is too miserly.Yet Ohio PMPM spending grew at 1.2% for 2016 and 2.6% so far for 2017. Mr. Kasich\u2019s Office of Health Transformation projects PMPM Medicaid growth rates of 1.9% in 2018 and 1.5% for 2019. The notion that Ohio can\u2019t manage under the Senate bill\u2019s caps is purely political, or to be more precise, politically cynical.If Mr. Kasich wanted to be constructive, his own reforms show how states can improve Medicaid. The decision to join new Medicaid was extremely costly, but the state has shifted spending from nursing homes and toward more efficient home- and community-based services. From 2009 to 2011 Ohio Medicaid PMPM spending was growing at 8.9% annually. Now the average is 1.72%.Ohio Medicaid director       Barbara Sears       said in an interview that the \u201clayering effects\u201d of the Senate growth rate and the expansion phase down were too severe, but she also suggested that if the plan was moderated, \u201cOhio would lead the way.\u201d But then why is her boss summoning the apocalypse, rather than detailing changes he could live with? Does it have something to do with a 2020 primary challenge?By the way, the GOP Senate bill is likely to include $45 billion to combat opioid abuse, which Mr. Kasich says is \u201clike spitting in the ocean.\u201d This new money would come on top of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016, which this year will increase opioid spending by 542% at Health and Human Services and 113% at the Justice Department. This is like adding an ocean to another ocean.A few GOP Senators are sore that we wrote the other day that \u201csome Republicans\u201d seem to want \u201cto ratify ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion as an unrepealable and unreformable welfare program.\u201d If Mr. Kasich doesn\u2019t qualify as a ringleader for this crowd, maybe that\u2019s because he\u2019s getting harder and harder to identify as a Republican.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 18:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/john-kasichs-medicaid-lecture-1499466908", "news_title": "John Kasich\u2019s Medicaid Lecture", "keywords": "John Kasich,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,editorials,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"}, {"content": "DETROIT\u2014U.S. auto regulators have opened a probe into a fuel pump part that could cause a gasoline leak, possibly affecting up to 10 major auto brands and already leading to the recall of nearly half a million vehicles, including certain             Audi,       Porsche and             Volkswagen        VLKAY 0.12%       models.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is looking into defective fuel pump flanges made by             Continental        CTTAY 0.21%       Automotive GmbH, a unit of Continental AG, and used by top auto makers and other automotive suppliers, according to public filings.No accidents or injuries are known to have been caused by the flaw, said a U.S. spokeswoman for the Hannover, Germany company.Flanges are collars that surround openings where parts connect.

Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, said.The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment.The criticism marks the second time in a week that the department has faced criticism for regulatory changes under new Secretary of Education       Betsy DeVos.       On Thursday, a group of 18 attorneys general announced a lawsuit against the department regarding the elimination of rules meant to curb deceptive recruiting tactics by colleges.The change in discrimination investigation policy, originally uncovered by ProPublica, rolls back rules enacted during former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration that required some discrimination probes to trigger an automatic review of the school\u2019s previous complaint data, in an attempt to catch wide-reaching problemsA recent OCR investigation of this sort found a Palo Alto, Calif., school district repeatedly failed to properly respond and investigate sexual assault reports.In the memo, Ms. Jackson wrote that eliminating the automatic systemic discrimination investigations at schools, which involves obtaining three years of past complaint history at the institution, will increase efficiency and help reduce the office\u2019s case backlog.\u201cThese instructions in particular are designed to empower our investigative staff to clear case backlogs and resolve complaints within a reasonable time-frame,\u201d Ms. Jackson wrote in the memo.Investigations into systemic discrimination problems in schools can still be triggered if a complaint directly accuses an institution of such a practice or, if during the investigation of the complaint, investigators find evidence that points to a wider problem at a school, Ms. Jackson said. The department\u2019s civil rights leaders and regional directors also will regularly meet to discern if trends are emerging.Yet the senators have expressed unease this bottom-up approach to investigating discrimination claims will keep OCR from discovering wider problems.\u201cFar too often, when cases of mismanagement are brought to light, it is part of a larger pattern that includes a campus climate where victims are afraid to come forward and the institution has systematically discouraged reporting,\u201d Ms. McCaskill and Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s letter read.Corrections & Amplifications   Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos\u2019s last name was misspelled in an earlier version of this article.

A U.S.-Russian agreement last year on a nationwide cease-fire and closer military cooperation collapsed after Moscow-backed Syrian forces stepped up an offensive on Aleppo.The U.S. backs rebel groups opposing Syria\u2019s government and Russia backs Syrian leader       Bashar al-Assad,        with Iran and Iranian-backed militias as allies. Despite differing goals and approaches, the U.S. and Russia had been meeting secretly in recent months to discuss setting up what officials call a de-escalation zone in southwest Syria, an area where Syrian government forces and rebels would be separated.Officials hope that the establishment of the first such zone will help reduce violence and that the U.S. and Russia can work to set up other zones around the country. Officials have provided few details on how the zone will be enforced or the parameters of the agreement.\u201cThis is our first indication of the U.S. and Russia being able to work together in Syria,\u201d Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       told reporters in Hamburg after participating in the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin, who are attending the Group of 20 leading nations summit. \u201cAs a result of that, we had a very lengthy discussion regarding other areas in Syria that we can continue to work together on.\u201dThe agreement is set to take effect on Sunday at noon Syria time. A senior State Department official involved in the negotiations said that the U.S., Jordan and Russia last week agreed on a \u201cline of contact\u201d where regime and opposition forces are operating. The cease-fire deal was reached Friday in Amman, Jordan, the official said.Talks are ongoing about monitoring mechanisms and other efforts to make the cease-fire more durable, the official said, adding that the ultimate goal would be to create conditions to try to bring about a political solution.U.S. officials spearheading the secret talks leading up to the deal included Michael Ratney, the special U.S. envoy for Syria, and Brett McGurk, a special presidential envoy for the Islamic State fight. Mr. Tillerson said in comments on Wednesday, before leaving for Germany, that the U.S. was willing to discuss such a plan.Mr. Tillerson said the agreement includes commitments on who will secure the area but declined to specify which forces are involved, saying \u201cwe have a few more details to work out.\u201d He said he expects the details in less than a week and that the \u201ctalks are very active and ongoing.\u201dOne question is whether Russia can deliver Iranian and Syrian cooperation for the cease-fire. Western diplomats in the region have been skeptical that Moscow has much influence over Damascus and Tehran, despite backing them militarily. Syrian government officials didn\u2019t comment on the initiative.The senior official involved in the talks said the U.S. had received assurances from Russia that the Assad regime would be willing to abide by the terms of the agreement.The area affected by Friday\u2019s agreement, along the Jordanian and Israeli borders, has seen heavy fighting recently. Opposition forces involved in the fighting include Western-backed groups and Islamist factions. Activists and monitoring groups have reported repeated pro-regime airstrikes and barrel bombs dropped on the opposition-held parts of Daraa, killing civilians.Russian Foreign Minister       Sergei Lavrov       said the cease-fire would be enforced by Russia, the U.S. and Jordan. Officials from Jordan and Israel were involved in the U.S.-Russia talks.Some Syrian opposition groups see the U.S.-Russian deal as a move more to protect the Jordanian and Israeli borders than to secure peace for Syrians, but that both Syrian sides in the war would have to try to comply.\u201cWhen the big ones talk, I believe neither the regime nor the opposition can interfere,\u201d said Yahya al-Aridi, an opposition spokesman and member of delegations to previous peace talks.The agreement is separate from a series of talks that have been held in Astana, Kazakhstan, and led by Russia, Turkey and Iran to create similar zones. U.S. officials are wary of Iran\u2019s involvement in the Astana talks and have participated only as observers.In his statement before leaving for Germany, Mr. Tillerson said that the U.S. was prepared to work with Russia in Syria and would consider joint mechanisms to ensure stability there, including no-fly zones and coordinated aid deliveries.U.S. military officials have long been wary of no-fly zones, which they see as costly and having the potential to drag the U.S. further into a conflict. The de-escalation zones carry different restrictions than no-fly zones.There also are multiple \u201cdeconfliction zones\u201d in Syria where U.S. and Russian militaries have been working to avoid mishaps, including one around a base near the Syrian town of Al Tanf close to the Iraqi border. U.S. forces and their allies are operating near the zone.Moscow and Washington share common interests in trying to stabilize Syria, Mr. Tillerson said on Friday.\u201cI would say what may be different this time, I think, is the level of commitment on the part of the Russian government,\u201d he said.Iranian forces have become more involved in regime ground offensives, including in southern Syria, and that the U.S. and Russia have overlapping interests to prevent spillover effects in Jordan and Israel, said Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\u201cWe\u2019ll see where it goes.

Changes to that rule and seven others appeared on a list released by the Internal Revenue Service in response to an April executive order from President Donald Trump.Friday\u2019s notice doesn\u2019t change the regulations or indicate how significant the changes might be. It seeks comments from the public by Aug. 7, and asks whether and how the rules should be \u201crescinded or modified.\u201d\u201cTreasury intends to propose reforms\u2014potentially ranging from streamlining problematic rule provisions to full repeal\u2014to mitigate the burdens of these regulations in a final report submitted to the president,\u201d Friday\u2019s notice said. That final report is due by Sept. 18.The debt regulations were part of the Obama administration\u2019s attempt to address inversions, the corporate technique of putting a headquarters\u2019 address outside a country. The rules, under Section 385 of the tax code, made it harder for companies to engage in the practice known as earnings stripping, in which they load up the U.S. operations with debt to reduce U.S. taxes. The rules affect other companies, including firms with headquarters overseas that aren\u2019t inverted U.S. businesses.\u201cThe whole idea of the 385 rules were, if you\u2019re going to do intercompany loans, you should have a real bona fide loan,\u201d said       Mark Mazur,        who led the regulatory effort as the Obama Treasury Department\u2019s top tax policy official.The announcement about the debt rules is \u201ca positive signal that this administration is focused on growth,\u201d said       Nancy McLernon,        president of the Organization for International Investment, a trade group that represents foreign-headquartered companies. She said the Treasury should immediately delay implementation during the review.Rep.       Lloyd Doggett       (D., Texas) said the intercompany-debt regulations were a \u201cmodest measure\u201d that would prevent billions in corporate-tax avoidance.\u201cThis may be just another example of the overall Trump approach\u2014\u2018If Obama did it, undo it,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Doggett said. \u201cWe should be doing more to prevent big multinational tax dodgers from avoiding their fair share of our national security and other vital public services, not less.\u201dOther changes to limit inversions weren\u2019t included on Friday\u2019s list. Those may remain in place, along with dozens of other tax regulations from 2016 and 2017.\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many on the list, so that\u2019s kind of a sense that people think they got it about right,\u201d Mr. Mazur said.The Treasury\u2019s list included two rules that have been proposed but haven\u2019t taken effect yet: changes to how assets are valued for gift and estate-tax purposes, and new definitions for what entities can issue tax-exempt bonds. Rules that haven\u2019t yet taken effect are relatively easy to withdraw.Another rule on the Treasury\u2019s target list made it harder for U.S. companies to transfer certain assets to foreign corporations, where they can defer U.S. taxation until they bring income home. Before those rules took effect, companies had more ability to make transfers of intellectual property while making them partially tax-free by attributing some of the value to foreign goodwill.Business groups have been urging the administration to repeal or change several of these rules. Seven of the eight rules appear on a list that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent the government in May.These rules \u201care some of the most burdensome to the business community, and we applaud Treasury\u2019s recognition for the need for action on them,\u201d said Caroline Harris, the chamber\u2019s vice president of tax policy.Another rule up for revision or repeal allows the IRS to have outside attorneys question witnesses during audits. That has become an issue in a tax dispute between the government and Microsoft Corp. Company spokespeople didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'Treasury Plans to Reverse Curbs on Inversions.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 17:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-treasury-identifies-eight-tax-regulations-for-possible-changes-1499453259", "news_title": "U.S. Treasury Targets Eight Tax Regulations for Possible Changes ", "keywords": "corporate debt,inversions,tax avoidance,tax code,taxes,tax overhaul,tax reform,U.S. Treasury Department,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,corporate taxation,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,crime,legal action,financial crime,fraud,politics,international relations,domestic politics,tax fraud,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department"}, {"content": "OTTAWA\u2014Canada on Friday announced a formal settlement with Omar Khadr, a Canadian held by the U.S. at Guantanamo Bay for over a decade, as the government here attempts to bring closure to a case that fueled a bitter debate on how to handle national security threats.Canada\u2019s Liberal government said in a statement it wished to \u201capologize to Mr. Khadr for any role Canadian officials may have played in relation to his ordeal abroad and any resulting harm.\u201dOther settlement details, such as a payment for damages, were not publicly disclosed Friday. A person familiar with the details said the payment was about 10 million Canadian dollars ($7.75 million).The settlement and apology, which immediately sparked an uproar here, brings an end to a drawn-out lawsuit Mr. Khadr\u2019s lawyers launched against the Canadian government. It sought C$20 million in damages over his detention in Guantanamo Bay and what it claimed were a violation of his constitutional rights by Canadian officials who interviewed Mr. Khadr while he was in custody.On the surface, Mr. Khadr\u2019s settlement bears some similarity to a payment Canada made in 2007 to Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen born in Syria, of more than C$10 million after Canadian authorities sent incorrect intelligence about him to U.S. officials. That information was later used to remove Mr. Arar from a plane in New York and deport him to Syria, where he was jailed and tortured.Mr. Khadr\u2019s case dates to 2002 when he was captured by U.S. forces after a firefight in Afghanistan in which he killed a U.S. Army combat medic, according to a later conviction. His detainment at the military facility in Guantanamo Bay became the most high-profile in Canada in the post 9/11 era, causing a yearslong ideological fight. The former Conservative government under Prime Minister       Stephen Harper       portrayed Mr. Khadr as a convicted terrorist and national security threat, while others said his rights were being breached.On Friday, Public Safety Minister       Ralph Goodale       acknowledged that Canadians \u201chold deeply divided views\u201d of Mr. Khadr, who was 15 years old in July 2002 when he killed the medic with a grenade. The explosion also caused another soldier to lose sight in one eye.Mr. Khadr was born in Canada and later brought to Afghanistan by his father Ahmed Khadr, who was killed in a 2003 shootout with Pakistani security forces, U.S. officials have said. The elder Mr. Khadr was a confidant of Osama bin Laden, and his family was reviled in Canada as terrorist sympathizers.\u201cThe debate no doubt will continue, passionately, on all sides,\u201d Mr. Goodale said at a press conference in Ottawa.The settlement \u201cis not about the battlefield in Afghanistan,\u201d he said, adding the agreement was justified given mounting legal costs and the unlikelihood that Ottawa would emerge victorious in the lawsuit after a 2010 top-court ruling said Mr. Khadr\u2019s constitutional rights were infringed.\u201cIn pursuit of justice and national security, governments must respect [constitutional] rights, human rights and the rule of law,\u201d Mr. Goodale said.Mr. Khadr was transferred to the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay about three months after being captured in 2002. In October 2010, he pleaded guilty to a series of charges including murder, attempted murder, providing support for terrorism and spying.He arrived in Canada in 2012 to serve the remainder of his eight-year sentence, but in 2015 an Alberta court granted him bail. Mr. Khadr has lived in western Canada ever since.In an interview with the Canadian Press news agency, Mr. Khadr said the settlement is \u201ca matter of trying to find the best way where we can reconciliate what happened and move forward in a way that is going to be healthy for everybody.\u201d As for the financial reward, he said he doesn\u2019t see this as \u201cprofiting,\u201d adding: \u201cI\u2019m sorry if this is causing people pain. I\u2019m trying to turn a page.\u201dIn June, lawyers for the family of Chris Speer, the combat medic who died, and Layne Morris, blinded in the 2002 battle, filed a notice with a Canadian court to stop Mr. Khadr from receiving any financial reward from the federal government in the event of a settlement.David Winer, a lawyer representing the Speer and Morris families, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.The leader of Canada\u2019s Conservative Party,       Andrew Scheer,        said Friday the apology and financial payout \u201cwas disgusting,\u201d referring to Mr. Khadr during a press conference as a convicted terrorist. He said the settlement \u201cshows such a mean-spirited attitude toward the true victims in this whole ordeal,\u201d and sends a disturbing message to soldiers in Canada, U.S. and elsewhere.Audrey Macklin, a University of Toronto law professor who has been a vocal supporter of Mr. Khadr, said the former Conservative government\u2019s relentless \u201cvilification\u201d of him has increased the public divide over his case. Ms. Macklin said she hopes the settlement \u201cwill be an inevitable culmination and hopefully closure of this episode.\u201dWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and David George-Cosh at david.george-cosh@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 17:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-set-to-announce-settlement-with-former-guantanamo-detainee-1499437109", "news_title": "Canada Announces Settlement with Former Guantanamo Detainee ", "keywords": " afghanistan, bombs, canada, canada liberal government, guantanamo bay, justin trudeau,omar khadr, omar khadr apology,omar khadr settlement, ralph goodale, soldier death, stephen harper, trudeau,Canadian government,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,terrorism"}, {"content": "HAMBURG\u2014President       Donald Trump       faced off with world leaders over trade policy on Friday, positioning the U.S. as the most vocal critic of the international economic order and leaving it largely isolated.The Group of 20 summit, long a platform to tackle common problems for leaders presiding over 80% of the world economy, split in two at its outset, with Mr. Trump adopting defiant opening positions toward the rest of a group largely united on the issues of trade and climate change.Mr. Trump told the G-20 leaders in the closed-door meeting that they were \u201clargely responsible\u201d for the U.S.\u2019s trade deficit, according to an official. China alone is responsible for about two thirds of the U.S. trade deficit. European Union leaders bluntly warned the president that they would retaliate against protectionist measures from Washington.\u201cThe vast majority pointed out that we need free, but also fair, trade,\u201d German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       said, seeking to reconcile the two positions. The U.S. has emphasized \u201cfair\u201d trade in contrast to past official language focusing on open markets.\u201cThe discussions on this are very difficult,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.Disagreements deepened a G-20 schism that officials had flagged before the two-day gathering. Mr. Trump\u2019s critical stance toward international initiatives largely isolated the U.S., while the remaining 19 pushed for more cooperation, according to people at the discussions.The first day of the two-day summit paved the way for what is likely to be a bland joint communiqu\u00e9 that papers over deep rifts on two core issues of the meeting\u2014trade and climate change\u2014and testament to the American retreat from the global consensus since Mr. Trump\u2019s election.With the global economic recovery slowly taking hold, some G-20 members urged the group to also tackle international crises from migration to the inequality wrought by globalization.The unusual level of international tensions surrounding this year\u2019s gathering\u2014and the attendance of polarizing leaders, from Russia\u2019s       Vladimir Putin       to Turkey\u2019s       Recep Tayyip Erdogan      \u2014were mirrored in the streets of Hamburg, where violent protesters set cars on fire and clashed with police for a second day as Ms. Merkel greeted arriving heads of state.Before his arrival at the G-20 summit, Mr. Trump told a cheering crowd Thursday in Poland that the West must fight existential threats and uphold its values. His address signaled a shift from May, when Mr. Trump withheld an unequivocal commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s defense during the alliance\u2019s summit.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for a long time to hear these words from President Trump, but the real question is whether it was a one-time incident or a new policy,\u201d European Council President       Donald Tusk       said Friday as the gathering kicked off. \u201cThe first test will be our meeting here.\u201dInitial signs weren\u2019t encouraging to some of the summit participants.For Mr. Trump, fair trade means erasing the U.S. trade deficit with G-20 countries, and that position \u201cdrastically differed from all others,\u201d Russian Economic Development Minister Maxim Oreshkin said.The White House has pledged to unilaterally rebalance what it brands as unfair bilateral terms of trade, in contrast with the rest of the G-20 countries that advocate for global platforms to resolve imbalances.\u201cThe right course is a lack of protectionism; we have to ensure that we move together resolutely,\u201d European Commission President       Jean-Claude Juncker       said, citing the EU and Japan\u2019s landmark trade agreement on Thursday as an example of the way forward.VIEW InteractiveFrench President       Emmanuel Macron       also delivered a robust defense of free trade\u2014taking off his jacket in the process, according to two officials. He also argued in favor of more robust trade defenses, albeit on an international level.Mr. Trump had already ruffled feathers by scrapping a 12-nation Pacific trade agreement and starting to renegotiate America\u2019s trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.The tensions at the summit complicate Ms. Merkel\u2019s agenda, led by her effort to clinch an action plan for global economic growth.The German chancellor is also seeking to bolster the 2015 Paris Agreement to halt climate change. On that front, too, Ms. Merkel is up against Mr. Trump. The president last month decided to ditch the accord, arguing it hurts U.S. interests.In a stark sign of U.S. isolation, officials said leaders may have to split the climate section of their communiqu\u00e9 into three parts\u2014one of them singling out American views\u2014to reflect Mr. Trump\u2019s objections.Germany, which holds the rotating G-20 presidency this year, proposed that all participants agree to the potential gains from investing in green economy and innovation, and that the U.S. state its position on climate change while all remaining members reaffirm their commitment to achieve Paris Agreement goals.The U.S. wasn\u2019t the sole source of friction. The global migration crisis, which has hit Europe especially hard, divided nations. The EU is calling on G-20 leaders to fight illegal migration with United Nations sanctions against smugglers, which Mr. Tusk also billed as a humanitarian duty.The idea has found support among diplomats leading negotiations but also opposition from Russia and China, an official involved in the G-20 talks said, adding that the U.S. is \u201csupportive in principle.\u201dEU efforts to shut a central Mediterranean route from Libya to Italy have fallen short, with more than 85,000 people arriving this year pressuring Rome\u2019s resources. And more than 20,000 asylum seekers continue to stream into Germany every month.Mr. Tusk asked G-20 leaders to be \u201cruthless\u201d and destroy the people smugglers\u2019 business model with asset freezes and travel bans. Such a U.N. measure would be the least that the global community could do, he said.\u201cToday we do not have the full support even for this minimum. If we don\u2019t get it, it will be a sad proof of the hypocrisy of some of the G-20 members,\u201d Mr. Tusk said. \u201cBut I still hope we will succeed.\u201dWrite to Emre Peker at emre.peker@wsj.com, Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.com and William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Breaks With Global Leaders.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 17:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-warns-on-protectionism-as-g-20-kicks-off-1499430235", "news_title": "Trump Clashes With Global Leaders Over Trade", "keywords": "g-20,globalization,group of 20,trade barriers,trump,u.s. politics,u.s. trade,European Union,Group of 20,Donald Trump,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,climate change,international relations,natural environment,global,world issues,politics,tariffs"}, {"content": "New YorkAs the final bells of the academic year sounded in New York City\u2019s public schools two weeks ago, thousands of students and parents were dreaming of a better education down the block. Through a citywide program called Public School Choice, parents can apply to move their children from a poorly performing school to a better one. But the city Education Department\u2019s stringent policy means that many of these requests are rejected. Last year about 5,500 families applied, but the city approved transfers for only 3,500 students.Soula Adam,        a single mother in Astoria, Queens, knows the disappointment of the rest. For years she tried to help her son Harry escape what she felt were lackluster teachers at P.S. 70, the same neighborhood school that she had attended as a girl. \u201cI liked P.S. 122 on Ditmars Boulevard,\u201d she recalls, explaining that the school was more rigorous and only two miles away. But she knew the city\u2019s transfer guidelines would never allow her son into P.S. 122. \u201cIf you\u2019re not zoned,\u201d she says, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t get in.\u201dHarry tried to win a spot at a charter school through an open lottery, but his number wasn\u2019t called. Eventually he earned a scholarship to Saint       Demetrios Astoria,        a Greek Orthodox school close to home. That private generosity opened the door for the Adams, but thousands of other public-school pupils remain stuck.Transfers between New York City schools first became available in 2003, after the No Child Left Behind Act required districts nationwide to create options for students whose schools lagged behind federal standards for progress. For more than a decade, however, the Education Department permitted moves only for students with specific hardships, such as health issues or one-way commutes over 75 minutes. Former Schools Chancellor       Joel Klein       defended this restriction on transfers for the sake of choice. \u201cThe system doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d he told the Observer in 2014. \u201cBy definition, some kids get better choices.\u201dBut last year the city began allowing \u201cguidance\u201d transfers, available to students who are not \u201cprogressing or achieving academically or socially.\u201d The update received favorable notice from school-choice advocates, but the kicker is in the fine print: Transfers are still open only to students in 5% of New York City\u2019s schools\u2014the 88 designated as \u201cpriority\u201d because of perennially poor performance. But nonpriority schools can still be bad, with as few as a quarter of test-takers proficient in English and math. Students at these schools have no recourse to move out and up.Consider a tale of two elementary schools: P.S. 173 (Fresh Meadows) and P.S. 187 (      Hudson Cliffs      ), less than a mile apart in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. Both are zoned schools with no admission criteria beyond place of residence, and yet the share of students passing state exams in 2016 was 30 percentage points higher at Hudson Cliffs. The only thing that stops a bright student at Fresh Meadows from attaining success up the street is the city\u2019s red tape.In the long term, the free flow of students enabled by a reformed transfer program would put pressure on underperforming schools, as students left and budgets tightened. Successful schools wouldn\u2019t be burdened by the influx of newcomers, since New York\u2019s funding algorithm allocates enough money each year to cover the marginal cost of each additional student.Critics may say the way to fix a bad school isn\u2019t to cut its funding. But why should fear of tight budgets hold back students who are ready to succeed? Moreover, many of the city\u2019s specialized private schools that serve low-income students have delivered impressive results with as little as half the funding per student as traditional public schools.New York pours most of its hope for academic mobility into the high-school admissions process, which lets students apply to any school in the city through a competitive application. But ninth grade is often too late for students who might have thrived with better primary education. A 2016 report by New York\u2019s Independent Budget Office showed that regardless of individual scores, students from low-performing middle schools were much less likely to apply to top high schools. However bright they are, children in pitiful schools may develop low expectations that conform to their environments, long before they get a shot at an elite high school like       Stuyvesant       or Bronx Science.The Education Department\u2019s summer homework is simple: Revamp the city\u2019s transfer standards. Come up with a plan to promote the new policy in every school\u2019s guidance office. And then get out of the way.Mr. Ukueberuwa is a       Robert L.

That seems to be the message from its president,       Darren Walker,        and his colleagues. Ford, the third-largest foundation in the U.S., recently announced that over the next 10 years it will put $1 billion of its $12 billion endowment into \u201cmission-related investments.\u201dUntil recently, foundations generally invested the way everyone else did\u2014to get the most bang for the buck. The difference was that foundations sought returns so as to have more money to give away. But now nonprofit leaders such as       Clara Miller       of the F.B. Heron Foundation have decided to go instead for social-impact investing, with the goal of generating a social or environmental effect alongside a financial return. \u201cIf we were just doing good work for a limited number of people, we would never eliminate poverty,\u201d Ms. Miller told Crain\u2019s last month. \u201cWe wanted to be influential beyond our own giving. We wanted to get others into this mindset.\u201dYet mission-based investing also can create serious distortions in the market. For foundations like Ford, whose mission has long been entangled with encouraging more federal spending on a variety of programs, the potential for harm is significant.Fifteen years ago, for example, the foundation invested $2 million in the Bay Area Equity Fund, a backer of the electric-car company Tesla, according to a recent article in the Chronicle of Philanthropy. \u201cThe foundation declined to provide details,\u201d the article continues, \u201cbut estimates suggest the fund\u2019s value grew 24 percent, while its investment in Tesla alone increased more than tenfold.\u201dWhat\u2019s odd about this is that Tesla is still not selling cars at a profit, but it has received billions of dollars in state and federal subsidies, as well as payments from other car companies buying \u201czero-emissions vehicle\u201d credits. Ford has reaped its returns in part thanks to subsidies and regulations.Both politicians and the Ford Foundation are picking winners and losers\u2014favoring what they see as more environmentally sound cars over traditional ones. Generous government subsidies also create distortions within the electric vehicle market itself. As       Adam Andrzejewski       of OpenTheBooks.com notes, Zero Motorcycles has received millions in credit from the Export-Import Bank, subsidies from the state of California, and even grants from the city of Santa Cruz. It could hardly have been a surprise when Zero\u2019s biggest competitors, Brammo and Mission Motorcycles, exited the business in 2015.If the subsidies go away at some point, Ford may lose a significant chunk of money\u2014a risk it has presumably decided is worth taking. But the foundation is also putting its pretty big thumb on the scale.Traditionally, foundations were supposed to be independent\u2014needing to worry about neither financial returns nor voters\u2019 demands. But these days it seems philanthropic money simply follows government money. The Rockefeller Foundation is investing part of its endowment to launch a clean Energy Investment Trust that will \u201csupport institutional investments into renewable energy.\u201d In other words, it will pour money into solar and wind power, where government is already deeply involved.Similarly, Ford has announced it will invest in affordable housing in the U.S. This is an area where government regulations and subsidies have already distorted the market significantly, creating shortages in cities and constructing public housing with terrible living conditions.Nonprofits often see government as leading private investment. A post earlier this year on the blog Broadway Journal explained that when a theater receives a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, it \u201cconfers a stamp of approval for a project, which is appealing to other donors.\u201dBut it\u2019s not as if government gets out of the way once private money starts flowing. Many nonprofits take taxpayer money even when they don\u2019t need it. As of June 2016, the Metropolitan Museum of Art had $3.82 billion in total assets and annual revenue and support of $379 million. But last year it got a $50,000 NEA grant for its \u201cAge of Empires\u201d exhibit.One problem with public-private partnerships is that the private partner often ends up covering the public partner\u2019s mistakes. So much of foundation giving these days seems aimed at trying to fix public institutions. Yet this money\u2014hundreds of millions of dollars for large public school systems, affordable housing or AmeriCorps and the World Bank\u2014seems simply to fall into the abyss.With mission-driven investing the opportunities for private philanthropy to follow government will only grow, leaving foundations like Ford, more than ever, throwing good money after bad.Mr. Piereson is president of the William E.

The most popular article on the Journal\u2019s website on Wednesday was headlined \u201c            Volvo                   to Switch to Electric, in First for Major Auto Firm.\u201d On its front page the next morning, the             New York Times                   declared Volvo \u201cthe first mainstream automaker to sound the death knell of the internal combustion engine.\u201dWell, not exactly. By 2019, Volvo said all its cars would be hybrids or gas-electric hybrids or \u201cmild\u201d gas-electric hybrids\u2014i.e., most will continue to have internal combustion engines.\u201cThis announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,\u201d is how Volvo chief executive       H\u00e5kan Samuelsson       actually put it (emphasis added).Volvo, unlike just about every major car maker, doesn\u2019t even have an electric car in the market today. Its big winner is a luxury SUV, a gasoline-powered vehicle whose top-of-the-line model is further enhanced, yes, by a supplemental electric drive.The hybrid version of the XC90 comes with a $75,000 price tag: A customer who wants a hybrid is also presumed to want the 19-speaker, 1,400-watt sound system, the self-parking package and every other option Volvo can stuff into a $75,000 SUV.Therein lies the real point. Volvo\u2019s announcement signals nothing about the electric-car future and everything about Volvo\u2019s niche marketing.Not even Volvo could have expected the bounty of free media it won this week. The Swedish company clearly left more impression on American psyches than it ever did on American pocketbooks. In its best years in the 1980s and the mid-2000s, it never broke 0.8% of the U.S. market.Its brand image as a virtuous innovator survives from the day when it heavily promoted Volvo safety. But Volvo-like safety has long since become the price of admission in the car business, so Volvo has been deliberately rebranding its niche\u2014and its ambitions are entirely wrapped up in being a niche player\u2014as a technology icon.\u201cIt is not just bundling a lot of technology together to have a lot of gadgets in the car. It is important to deliver smart functionality and connectivity,\u201d Mr. Samuelsson explained back in 2014.But something else is also going on. Volvo is still run out of Sweden. Its chief is Swedish. But the Volvo car business has been owned by China\u2019s Geely since 2010.Volvo\u2019s biggest market now is China. Starting in 18 months, China\u2019s auto makers will be subject to an increasingly onerous California-style \u201czero-emission vehicle\u201d mandate.In fact, only through the intervention of       Angela Merkel,        the German leader who knows a thing or two about green excess, was the timeline delayed from 2018. Companies will have to build and sell electric cars in growing numbers (starting with 8% of total output) in order to be free to sell the vehicles Chinese customers are most likely to buy.To repeat a sore point, if the goal is to reduce greenhouse gases, passenger cars are not the place to aim. Electricity production is.China\u2019s real goal here is to reduce its strategic vulnerability to imported oil. By mandating a switch to electric cars, it\u2019s essentially mandating a switch to a domestic fuel in plentiful supply, coal. An eager convert is the city of Taiyuan, capital of China\u2019s coal belt, which enacted a rule requiring local taxis to be all-electric by 2021.As part of declaring its energy independence, especially its independence from the U.S. Navy, guardian of the Middle East oil routes, China also is seeking to capture world leadership in lithium-ion technology. Its electric-vehicle mandate includes a requirement that manufacturers use only locally made batteries.This is the China, by the way, that the media has been trying to turn into the world\u2019s conscience on global warming since       Donald Trump       removed the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement.OK, China\u2019s government can do pretty much as it wants. It can order domestic car makers, protected by a 25% import tariff, to make and sell electric cars using local batteries, likely at a loss. But even Beijing has run into political, i.e., democratic, opposition to piling on a European-style gas tax. After several attempts at raising it, gasoline remains a middle-of-the-road $4 a gallon.France\u2019s new president called this week for a ban on new petrol-fueled cars by 2040. Good luck with that, even in a country where taxes make gasoline $6.50 a gallon. In the U.S., Tesla, whose stock price has been plummeting in recent days, will be delivering its new Model 3 at a time of $2.24 gas, amid a complex thicket of pro-electric-car mandates that end up doing Tesla as much harm as good.Not even China, by central command, will be able to make mass adoption of electric cars economically viable, at least not without resort to massive mandates, subsidies and other distortions that bring their own problems.None of which is a problem for Volvo. Volvo isn\u2019t anticipating mass adoption of electric cars. Volvo is anticipating only that its affluent audience will associate Volvo with whatever is cool and cutting-edge in automotive technology at the moment.Appeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 17:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/volvo-discovers-electric-vehicle-hype-1499462079", "news_title": "Volvo Discovers Electric-Vehicle Hype", "keywords": "electric vehicle,green energy,volvo,corporate,industrial news,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,commentaries,opinions,motor vehicles,passenger cars,alternative fuel vehicles,motor vehicle parts,automotive"}, {"content": "Berkeley, Calif.Rewriting the code of life has never been so easy. In 2012 scientists demonstrated a new DNA-editing technique called Crispr. Five years later it is being used to cure mice with HIV and hemophilia. Geneticists are engineering pigs to make them suitable as human organ donors.       Bill Gates      is spending $75 million to endow a few Anopheles mosquitoes, which spread malaria, with a sort of genetic time bomb that could wipe out the species. A team at Harvard plans to edit 1.5 million letters of elephant DNA to resurrect the woolly mammoth.\u201cI frankly have been flabbergasted at the pace of the field,\u201d says       Jennifer Doudna,        a Crispr pioneer who runs a lab at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cWe\u2019re barely five years out, and it\u2019s already in early clinical trials for cancer. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201dThe thing to understand about Crispr isn\u2019t its acronym\u2014for the record, it stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats\u2014but that it makes editing DNA easy, cheap and precise. Scientists have fiddled with genes for decades, but in clumsy ways. They zapped plants with radiation to flip letters of DNA at random, then looked for useful mutations. They hijacked the infection mechanisms of viruses and bacteria to deliver beneficial payloads. They shot cells with \u201cgene guns,\u201d which are pretty much what they sound like. The first one, invented in the 1980s, was an air pistol modified to fire particles coated with genetic material.Crispr is much more precise, as Ms. Doudna explains in her new book, \u201cA Crack in Creation.\u201d It works like this: An enzyme called Cas9 can be programmed to latch onto any 20-letter sequence of DNA. Once there, the enzyme cuts the double helix, splitting the DNA strand in two. Scientists supply a snippet of genetic material they want to insert, making sure its ends match up with the cut strands. When the cell\u2019s repair mechanism kicks in to fix the cut, it pastes in the new DNA.It\u2019s so exact that Crispr blurs the meaning of \u201cgenetically modified organism.\u201d The activists yelling about \u201cfrankenfish\u201d are generally upset about transgenic plants and animals\u2014those with DNA inserted from other species. But what about using Crispr to alter only a few letters of an organism\u2019s own genome, the kind of mutation that could happen naturally?Last year a professor at Penn State created blemish-resistant mushrooms by knocking out a gene that causes them to turn brown when handled. \u201cIt attracted attention,\u201d Ms. Doudna says, \u201cbecause the U.S. Department of Agriculture ruled that that type of plant product would not be regulated as a genetically modified organism.\u201dMs. Doudna welcomes this kind of streamlining as the Food and Drug Administration considers its own approach to Crispr crops. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. It takes years and years and years to bring a plant to market,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m all for safety of course and that has to come first. But I think it has to be done with knowledge of the science that makes sense.\u201dMedical labs are also putting Crispr to work, since it is potentially meticulous enough for routine use on people. The human genome is 3.2 billion letters, and in the wrong place a single typo\u2014a dozen or so misplaced atoms\u2014can create misery. For patients with disorders like cystic fibrosis, the obstacles to fixing the genetic glitch with Crispr seem mostly practical.First, there\u2019s delivery: A human body contains some 50 trillion cells. How do you get Crispr to the affected ones, and what percentage need to be edited successfully to matter? Ms. Doudna says injecting Crispr-laden viruses into animal tissues has resulted in rates of editing on the order of 70%\u2014enough to have a therapeutic benefit: \u201cIn muscular dystrophy, for example, it looks like you only need to have somewhere between 10% to 20%.\u201dSecond, there\u2019s the risk: Although Crispr aims at a 20-letter DNA sequence, occasionally it can hit a partial match and make an unintended edit. \u201cFor any drug that we\u2019re developing for treatment, you\u2019re going to have some kind of risk factors,\u201d Ms. Doudna says. \u201cIn this case it might be changes to DNA, and you have to decide what\u2019s the right level that you would tolerate.\u201d There are ways to minimize the mistakes, and some studies show so few off-target edits \u201cthat it\u2019s difficult to distinguish them from just errors in DNA sequencing.\u201dWhat seems to merit the risk today? \u201cSickle-cell disease,\u201d Ms. Doudna says: \u201cWell-known mutation. Single gene is involved. No treatments right now for people. They have these horrible crises where they\u2019re in terrible pain.\u201d Moreover, the faulty red blood cells can be drawn from a vein and isolated. \u201cThe actual DNA editing can be done outside the body,\u201d she says, \u201cvalidated first, and then the cells implanted and allowed to repopulate the blood supply.\u201d The approach may work for cancer, too: A Crispr clinical trial awaiting FDA approval would pull white blood cells, give them tumor-killing superpowers, and then put them back into action.It would be technically simpler, rather than working in fully grown patients, to fix genetic disorders early, in human eggs, sperm or embryos. But this raises thorny moral questions, since edits made to these cells would pass down to future generations, who can\u2019t consent to having their genes tweaked. In debates about this, the word \u201ceugenics\u201d comes up.At first, Ms. Doudna was reflexively opposed. \u201cI\u2019m not a religious person,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s more, just\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014sort of an intrinsic reaction, that it feels like a realm where maybe we shouldn\u2019t be messing around.\u201d Her position softened, somewhat to her own surprise, as she heard from hundreds of people facing horrific genetic diseases. \u201cThey\u2019re reaching out because they\u2019re desperate,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of them are asking me the questions you\u2019re asking about: How soon? How long will it be? Is there hope for my child?\u201dMs. Doudna recalls an email from a 26-year-old woman who\u2019d found out she carried a mutation in the gene BRCA1 that is associated with a 60% risk of breast cancer by age 70: \u201cShe said, \u2018Should I have a mastectomy?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014this was right after       Angelina Jolie,        worried about a similar mutation, did the same\u2014\u201c\u00a0\u2018Or do you think that gene-editing is going to come along in time for me? Or if not for me, at least so that I can get rid of this mutation in my eggs?\u2019\u00a0\u201dThere was a man who watched his father die of Huntington\u2019s disease and had three sisters diagnosed. There was a woman whose daughter had given birth to a child with Fragile X syndrome, which causes intellectual disability, but deeply wanted to conceive again. \u201cShe was very emotional,\u201d Ms. Doudna recounts. \u201cShe said, \u2018If there were a way to use this, and if I could use it in embryos or germ cells, I would have absolutely no hesitation about doing it.\u2019\u00a0\u201dA few bioethicists have even argued that research on editing human embryos is a \u201cmoral imperative,\u201d since roughly 6% of all babies have \u201cserious birth defects.\u201d As for the risk of \u201coff target\u201d edits, merely smoking cigarettes can create mutations in a man\u2019s sperm. One academic joked that if old-fashioned sex were up for regulatory review, the FDA would never sign off.Not everyone has the same reaction. A reporter interviewing Ms. Doudna once revealed she had a son with Down syndrome. \u201cShe said, \u2018I just want you to know that he\u2019s perfect just the way he is.\u2019 It was very touching,\u201d Ms. Doudna recalls, her voice flickering with emotion. Even if Crispr could have fixed that genetic defect, the woman said she wouldn\u2019t change it. Some people in the deaf community feel the same way, and Ms. Doudna respects that. \u201cEveryone\u2019s feeling about DNA and about their inheritance and their children is going to be different,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has to be a choice. People can decide what they want to do.\u201dMs. Doudna remains opposed to nontherapeutic editing, often characterized as \u201cdesigner babies,\u201d and she says regulators won\u2019t allow it, at least in the U.S. But other countries are less stringent. Is news of the first Crispr baby simply going to break one day? \u201cIt would be naive to think that that won\u2019t happen at some point,\u201d she says. Pressure to push forward will come not only from desperate people but also clinics abroad that may drum up business by saying: \u201cWe\u2019ll do things here that will be advantageous for your children that are not allowed elsewhere.\u201dThat\u2019s why Ms. Doudna sees the ethical debate as vital. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to enforce any kind of global regulations on anything, but certainly on science,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I think the next best thing is to try to encourage a global consensus that is strong enough that people feel some pressure to conform to it.\u201dThe plan to eradicate the Anopheles mosquito presents a similar problem of collective decision-making. One iteration would involve a version of the insect edited to carry DNA that creates sterile females. That trait could then be forced into the wild population using a \u201cgene drive.\u201d Recall the basic rules of heredity\u2014think back to that Punnett square from high school. Normally, an edited male in the wild would pass on the sterility gene to only half its offspring. Over many generations, the edited DNA would be diluted into oblivion.That\u2019s where the gene drive comes in. Scientists using Crispr in the lab have given the mosquito DNA that causes its cells to create Crispr. The result is a recursive, self-propagating gene that slices its reproductive competition. The edited mosquito passes on the sterility gene to nearly 100% of its offspring\u2014which in turn do the same. Theoretically, releasing a single gene-drive insect, or letting one escape out an air-conditioning vent, could spread the edited DNA to the entire species.Theoretically. \u201cAlthough we understand that these gene drives can work in a laboratory setting efficiently in fruit flies and things like that, how well would they really work environmentally?\u201d Ms. Doudna asks. \u201cEvolution is a very strong force. If you put a species in a wild setting where they have to compete with other species, if they have a disadvantage reproductively, even if it\u2019s a small disadvantage, they\u2019re going to lose out.\u201dMs. Doudna still needs to be convinced, too, of the wisdom of letting loose a gene drive. She cites her native Hawaii. \u201cSpecies were introduced to that environment that ended up having large unintended consequences,\u201d she says. Seeing that made her \u201cvery respectful of nature and very cautious about human beings\u2019 thinking they have the knowledge to predict what will happen.\u201dA final Crispr worry is that it makes DNA editing so easy anybody can do it. Simple hobby kits sell online for $150, and a community biotech lab in Brooklyn offers a class for $400.       Jennifer Lopez       is reportedly working on a TV drama called \u201cC.R.I.S.P.R.\u201d that, according to the Hollywood Reporter, \u201cexplores the next generation of terror: DNA hacking.\u201dMs. Doudna provides a bit of assurance. \u201cGenetics is complicated. You have to have quite a bit of knowledge, I think, to be able to do anything that\u2019s truly dangerous,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of hype, in my opinion, about DIY kits and are we going to have rogue scientists\u2014or even nonscientists\u2014randomly doing crazy stuff. I think that\u2019s not too likely.\u201dStill, a couple of years ago Ms. Doudna had a dream in which a colleague asked her to explain gene-editing to someone very important. Turns out it was       Hitler,        except with the face of a pig. This, she says now, was her awakening to Crispr\u2019s potential. \u201cTry to imagine: We\u2019re biochemists here, we\u2019re futzing around with bacteria, just fartin\u2019 around the lab, and students are doing experiments,\u201d she says. \u201cThen suddenly you have this discovery that you realize can be harnessed in a very different way.\u201dA few moments later she adds: \u201cIt was just this growing realization that this is no joke.

Yet the U.S. oil rig count rose Friday to the highest level in more than two years. Operators have now put more than 100 rigs back to work from Oklahoma to North Dakota in the past three months.Companies have more capital to keep drilling thanks to $57 billion Wall Street has injected into the sector over the last 18 months. Money has come from investors in new stock sales and high-yield debt, as well as from private equity funds, which have helped provide lifelines to stronger operators.Flush with cash, virtually all of them launched campaigns to boost drilling at the start of 2017 in the hope that oil prices would rebound.The new wave of crude has again glutted the market. The shale companies are edged even further from profitability, and a few voices have begun to question the wisdom of Wall Street financing the industry\u2019s addiction to growth.\u201cThe biggest problem our industry faces today is you guys,\u201d       Al Walker,        chief executive of             Anadarko Petroleum Corp.      , told investors at a conference last month.Wall Street has become an enabler that pushes companies to grow production at any cost, while punishing those that try to live within their means, Mr. Walker said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like going to AA. You know, we need a partner. We really need the investment community to show discipline.\u201dEven if companies cut back on drilling now, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to stop a new wave of oil from hitting the market in the second half of the year: U.S. shale output typically lags behind new drilling by four to six months, analysts say.\u201cThere\u2019s been insufficient discrimination on the part of sources of capital,\u201d said       Bill Herbert,        an energy analyst with Piper Jaffray\u2019s Simmons & Co.

But \u201cI think if you can take the long term view, the energy sector could be a good place to be in the second half of this year.\u201dSome signs suggest investors may be cooling on the U.S. oil patch, as persistently low prices make the prospect of profits more remote. An index of more than two dozen U.S. producers has fallen almost 20% since April.Producers haven\u2019t turned to equity markets as often this year: Stock offerings in the first six months of 2017 were down close to 70% compared with the same period in 2016. Yields on energy junk bonds have also started to climb, which makes debt financing more expensive for them.\u201cIt used to be the case where a sexy growth number would get your stock rocking and rolling,\u201d said Robin Wehb\u00e9, managing director at the Boston Company and portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Natural Resources Fund. \u201cNow, we don\u2019t want you to grow because we don\u2019t know if oil prices are going to get any better.\u201dThe change in sentiment may come too late to rescue the market. Shale companies are on track to spend $20 billion more than they will generate in the next six months if prices hover around $40 a barrel, analysts say.Even as they lost money, many shale producers saw their stock prices jump in the second half of 2016 as they laid out plans to drill again. They were buoyed by eager anticipation from Wall Street, including a record $34 billion in cash from new equity, according to Dealogic.Compensation practices play a role in the behavior of U.S. shale producers: Most of their management teams are paid based on growth or adding new oil and gas reserves\u2014not on profits\u2014according to       Matt Portillo,        an analyst at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., in Houston. \u201cUntil that changes, growth may continue to prevail,\u201d he said.Surviving shale outfits say technology gains have helped them identify drilling opportunities that make economic sense at $40 oil\u2014though similar claims in the recent past failed to pay off. Individual wells may make profits, but they often don\u2019t translate into overall returns because of operating costs the producer excludes.In 2016, when crude averaged $43 a barrel, about 30 of the biggest shale companies spent $1.58 in cash for every $1 they generated, according to FactSet. U.S. operators have lost a combined $130 billion since 2015.Major global producers including Saudi Arabia have dialed down output in recent months to sop up the glut of crude sloshing around the market, only to watch shale companies step in to fill the void.Shares in Austin-based             Parsley Energy Inc.       rose more than 4% in the week after a June presentation where it detailed plans that could boost its production by at least another 30% this year.Parsley can afford to forge ahead,       Bryan Sheffield,        the company\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview. The company has $1.6 billion to spend, including cash and debt in its borrowing base.At prices below $40, \u201cthere are only a handful of companies that can continue marching down the growth path,\u201d he said.\u2014Erin Ailworth contributed to this article.Write to Bradley Olson at Bradley.Olson@wsj.com and Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.comAppeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'Despite Oil\u2019s Fall, Drillers Won\u2019t Stop.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 16:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-cash-pumps-up-oil-production-even-as-prices-sag-1499419801", "news_title": "Wall Street Cash Pumps Up Oil Production Even as Prices Sag", "keywords": "ceo compensation,energy markets,oil investors,oklahoma,shale gas,u.s. shale oil industry,Rob Santangelo,analysts' comments,recommendations,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,discrimination,social issues,commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,energy"}, {"content": "Mexican President       Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto       and U.S. President       Donald Trump,        at their first one-on-one meeting since Mr. Trump took office, agreed Friday to explore new ways of allowing Mexican workers to temporarily enter the U.S. to help the agriculture industry.The proposal came at the end of a half-hour meeting between the two heads of state at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, where both sides also discussed the coming renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mexico\u2019s government said it hoped to finish by the end of this year.\u201cWe\u2019re negotiating Nafta and some other things with Mexico and we\u2019ll see how it all turns out, but I think that we\u2019ve made very good progress,\u201d Mr. Trump said after the meeting, according to Reuters.Despite the upbeat message, the meeting could have gotten off on the wrong foot when a reporter asked Mr. Trump if he still wanted Mexico to pay for the proposed border wall. Mr. Trump answered, \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d according to a video posted online by ABC News.Mexican Foreign Minister       Luis Videgaray,        who was seated next to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto during the exchange, said he didn\u2019t hear what Mr. Trump said, but added that the subject of the wall wasn\u2019t brought up during the meeting. Mexican officials have insisted they would walk out of any meeting between both sides if the U.S. team brought up Mexico paying for the wall.In Mexico, Messrs. Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Videgaray were both criticized on social media for not canceling the meeting after Mr. Trump\u2019s comment.The idea for a guest-worker program comes as the Trump administration is deporting growing numbers of illegal immigrants in the U.S. It would reprise the so-called Bracero Program from 1942 to 1964 that saw hundreds of thousands of Mexican farmworkers come to the U.S. legally to help pick crops and return to Mexico.Mr. Videgaray said the plan to study a possible guest-worker program, an idea floated amid labor shortages in parts of the U.S. economy like agriculture and construction, was a sign relations were improving between both sides amid strains over a host of issues, including the proposed wall.\u201cThe fact that the presidents agreed to explore new mechanisms for agricultural workers shows that the relationship is entering in a more constructive phase,\u201d he said in an interview with Mexico\u2019s Radio F\u00f3rmula.The Trump administration\u2019s tougher immigration policies and crackdown on unauthorized migrants have been cause for concern in Mexico, where U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security       John F. Kelly       was winding up three days of meetings Friday.Mr. Kelly stressed that the approach of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is to target migrants who are in the U.S. illegally who have also committed crimes, including those accused or convicted of minor infractions such as drunken driving.He also said ICE wouldn\u2019t deport \u201cDreamers,\u201d or young people living in the U.S. under the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, despite recent news reports of some Dreamers having been detained and deported.\u201cWe have not, not, not gone after anyone who has DACA status,\u201d Mr. Kelly told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. \u201cBarring any policy change or law, we are working at the other end of the spectrum: illegal aliens who have committed crimes.\u201dBut if ICE agents encounter undocumented immigrants in the course of their duties, they have been instructed to take them into custody for possible deportation, he said.Mr. Kelly met Friday with Mexico\u2019s Interior Minister       Miguel \u00c1ngel Osorio Chong       following meetings with Mexican officials focused on bilateral relations, economic partnerships and combating transnational criminal organizations.A surge in drug-related violence has led to a sharp increase in murders in Mexico, which totaled 11,155 in the first five months of this year, an increase of 31% from the year-earlier period.Mr. Kelly acknowledged that killings have risen sharply, but said he isn't worried about violence spilling over the border into the U.S. since drug cartels \u201care very careful about violence in the United States because of the reaction they feel the U.S. might take.\u201d\u201cThat violence has a lot to do of course with drug trafficking and production, which has as its root cause U.S. drug demand,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cWe Americans have got to do something about drug demand in our country.\u201dMr. Kelly said that in recent weeks, he has met with U.S. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson,        Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       and Health and Human Services Secretary       Tom Price       to discuss a \u201ccomprehensive drug-reduction campaign\u201d focused on educating young people about the consequences of illegal drug consumption.\u201cThe average college kid that does a little blow on the weekend, a little cocaine on the weekend, doesn\u2019t understand that from the point at which that coca is grown in Colombia, turned into cocaine, trafficked up through Central America and Mexico into the U.S., doesn\u2019t realize that a number of people have been murdered,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a violence-less drug deal \u2026 We have to make people understand that so they don\u2019t start using drugs.\u201dWrite to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 16:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-pena-nieto-discuss-mexican-guest-worker-proposal-1499460950", "news_title": "Trump, Pe\u00f1a Nieto Discuss Mexican Guest-Worker Proposal ", "keywords": "agriculture,g-20 summit,guest worker program,mexican workers,nafta,North American Free Trade Agreement,Donald Trump,Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,crime,legal action,international relations,illegal immigration,migration,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note rose Friday, capping the biggest two-week increase in nearly four months.A stronger-than-forecast June jobs report Friday sapped demand for bonds, but the selling pressure was contained by a wage indicator that suggested inflation wasn\u2019t a pressing threat to bondholders.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.393%\u2014its highest level since May 11\u2014compared with 2.369% Thursday. The yield has climbed 0.247 percentage point in the past two weeks, the largest two-week gain since the week ending March 10. Yields rise as bond prices fall.One key factor driving investors to sell Treasury debt has been worries that major central banks may dial back stimulus efforts after signs of broad improvement in the global economy.Investors are in particularly nervous about the European Central Bank, whose large bond-buying program has played a key role in sending global government bond yields to historically low levels. Analysts have warned that the value of government bonds may fall when central banks pivot away from the highly accommodative monetary policy that followed the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThe bond market is starting to realize that the era of easy money is going to come to an end,\u2019\u2019 said Ken Taubes, chief investment officer of U.S. investment management at Amundi Pioneer.The eurozone has been the center of the selloff. The yield on the 10-year German government debt, the benchmark for the region\u2019s debt markets, was 0.569% late Friday, the highest close since January 2016, according to Tradeweb. It rose by more than 0.3 percentage point over the past two weeks, the biggest two-week increase since June 2015.Some money managers said any further selloff in German bonds could further rattle the Treasury market, underscoring how closely tied global bond markets have become.In 2013, the Treasury market led a global bond selloff driven by concerns about reduced bond buying by the Federal Reserve. Some analysts said the past two weeks show how sensitive the Treasury market has become to price swings in peers overseas.Bond investors \u201cmust watch central bank policy evolution well beyond the U.S.\u2019s borders,\u2019\u2019 said       Rick Rieder,        chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Inc. The 10-year Treasury yield could rise to the range of 2.5% and 2.75% by the end of this year, he said.Looming sales of new debt may weigh down bond prices too, said some traders. A $24 billion sale of three-year Treasury notes is due next Tuesday, followed by $20 billion sale of 10-year notes next Wednesday and $12 billion sale of 30-year bonds next Thursday.Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen is scheduled to testify before Congress next Wednesday on monetary policy, which may also impact the bond market.Bond yields remain at very low levels from a historical standpoint. The 10-year Treasury yield is still below 2.446%, where it settled at the end of last year. In mid-March, the yield traded above 2.6%.Some investors say it may be hard for the yield gains to persist without a flare-up in inflation. Inflation chips away investors\u2019 purchasing power on their bond investments over time and is seen by many as a main threat to long-term government debt.The bond market\u2019s subdued reaction to Friday\u2019s jobs report underscores investors\u2019 focus on inflation readings. Average hourly earnings for private-sector workers rose 2.5% in June compared with a year earlier, little changed from prior months. Some investors said this suggested muted inflationary pressures, keeping a lid on yield gains.Ms. Yellen has said recent tepid inflation readings would be transitory. Investors who expect inflation to stay muted don\u2019t anticipate a significant rise in long-term Treasury yields, and some believe higher yields would be a buying opportunity.\u201cThe lack of inflation remains a hurdle for the Fed to raise interest rates,\u201d said       Gary Pollack,        head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s private wealth-management unit. \u201cIt would be hard for bond yields to rise sharply from here unless we see a clear trend of higher inflation.\u201dThe Bank of Japan took actions Friday aimed at containing higher bond yields. The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to a five-month high of 0.105% early Friday, prompting the BoJ to announce a fixed-rate bond-buying operation, which sent yields back down to around 0.084%.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 16:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-market-shakes-off-jobs-news-1499436533", "news_title": "U.S. Government Bond Yields Move Higher", "keywords": "bond prices,treasury yields,unemployment,us government bond yields,us jobs report,yield curve,economic performance,indicators,employment,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Donald Trump will soon have the ability to start remaking Washington\u2019s second-most powerful court, with the expected retirement of Judge Janice Rogers Brown from the U.

Written by Pagnol and directed by three different directors, \u201cMarius,\u201d \u201cFanny\u201d (1932) and \u201cC\u00e9sar\u201d (1936) tell a story filled with comedy and emotion, realism and poetry, that patiently unfolds in one close-knit waterfront community.Among the trilogy\u2019s indelible central characters are Marius (      Pierre Fresnay      ), who as a young man works in his father\u2019s bar, near the vessels that promise freedom and adventure, and loves the pretty, poignantly smitten cockle seller Fanny (Orane Demazis) but yearns to become a sailor. His father, C\u00e9sar (Raimu), who, when he isn\u2019t dozing or presiding over his bar, trades tall tales, gossip and genial insults with his friends. And the well-to-do sailmaker Honor\u00e9 Panisse (      Fernand Charpin      ), a widower who is infatuated with Fanny (and a character who memorably inspired the name of       Alice Waters\u2019s       Chez Panisse).Time had taken a physical toll on the trilogy\u2019s familiar faces, voices and landscapes, but the films were recently digitally restored under the supervision of       Nicolas Pagnol       and       Herv\u00e9 Pichard       of La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise, and now the Criterion Collection has released them on Blu-ray and DVD. The restorations offer a chance to rediscover Pagnol\u2019s vision, with its mingling of intimate theatricality, poetic passages and an inventive approach to sound and location that has been credited with anticipating Italian neorealism and the nouvelle vague.Born in Aubagne in 1895, Pagnol was a teacher and became a successful playwright in Paris before he eagerly explored the possibilities of talking pictures. He made the film version of his hit play \u201cMarius\u201d with funding from Paramount, casting actors from the stange production. Working closely with Pagnol, the Hungarian-born       Alexander Korda       directed \u201cMarius,\u201d incorporating atmospheric images that reflected his work in silent cinema and evoke Marius\u2019s and Fanny\u2019s inner turmoil, such as shots in which the beam of a lighthouse passes through inky darkness like waves of emotion.Marc All\u00e9gret       directed \u201cFanny,\u201d whose scenes shot on location include a breathtaking sequence in which Fanny, having discovered that she is pregnant out of wedlock, walks in a daze through the sunny streets to pray in a basilica. Pagnol himself directed \u201cC\u00e9sar,\u201d which continues the story years later, and was the only film in the trilogy to originate onscreen. At the tale\u2019s close, the characters grapple with aging, death and questions about the true meaning of love and family, but the shadows in \u201cMarius\u201d have given way to a luminous evocation of hard-won wisdom and forgiveness.The casting contributes much of the films\u2019 magic. There is scarcely a moment that isn\u2019t captivating in the brilliant comic actor Raimu\u2019s performance as the endearingly volatile C\u00e9sar. Fresnay, who would portray the aristocratic prisoner of war Capt. De Boeldieu in       Jean Renoir\u2019s       \u201cGrand Illusion\u201d (1937), brought a restless grace to the role of the ardent, anguished Marius, and Demazis is touching as his passionate but self-sacrificing beloved. It\u2019s difficult to watch the Marseille Trilogy and not fall in love with its characters.And audiences did exactly that, although critics have not always agreed about the significance of Pagnol\u2019s work. In an introduction recorded for the Criterion Collection, the director       Bertrand Tavernier       recounts how he was drawn to Pagnol by the writings of       Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut.       Mr. Tavernier also recalls seeing the trilogy over the years \u201cin prints which were worse and worse\u201d and being struck by its beauty on seeing the restoration.In his book \u201cMy Father\u2019s Glory,\u201d Pagnol describes learning from his schoolteacher father how to work with his hands by refurbishing junk and curios gleaned from secondhand shops. Renoir also wrote in his own autobiography that the production company Pagnol founded in 1932 \u201coperated like a medieval workshop. . . . He collected technicians, actors and workpeople in his country house like a fifteenth-century master-carpenter.\u201d The pragmatic, craftsmanlike approach Pagnol used to transform the flotsam and jetsam of everyday life into wondrous stories was one of the keys to his artistic achievement.Vital, humanistic and ingeniously combining a rich Proven\u00e7al theatrical tradition with cinematic innovation and his own flair for storytelling, Pagnol\u2019s trilogy is one of the treasures of French cinema. It may depict an idealized world, but when Marius, torn between the sea and Fanny, exclaims, \u201cI want, I want . . . In life, you can\u2019t always do what you want,\u201d it\u2019s one of many moments in the Marseille Trilogy that we can all understand.\u2014Ms. Jones writes about film and culture for the Journal.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 16:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/watching-lifes-pleasures-and-pains-unfold-1499460242", "news_title": "Watching Life\u2019s Pleasures and Pains Unfold", "keywords": "arts in review, cesar, fanny, french cinema,marcel pagnol, marius, marseille trilogy, movies,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,theater,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "New YorkGroucho Marx\u2014who knew something about anarchic comedy\u2014once said he was glad he was not Eloise\u2019s father, which is fine, because in       Kay Thompson\u2019s       classic \u201cEloise\u201d (1955), with illustrations by       Hilary Knight,        no father is mentioned. Even the 30-year-old mother, who has a charge account at Bergdorf\u2019s, never appears, having zero interest in her 6-year-old daughter, whom she has deposited at the Plaza Hotel with an English nanny.Eloise at the MuseumNew-York Historical Society  Through Oct. 9It isn\u2019t the most promising background for a heroine who has charmed readers for over 60 years, selling more than two million books. Nor does Eloise provide much of a behavioral model. She bangs on walls, harasses guests and staff, and boasts of being a nuisance. But she has immunity: Her mother, she tells us, knows the \u201cOwner.\u201dYet, somehow, this spoiled, self-created, self-celebrating child works her charms. And now that she has taken over galleries of the New-York Historical Society in \u201cEloise at the Museum,\u201d under the guidance of curator       Jane Bayard Curley      \u2014who first created the show for the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art in Amherst, Mass.\u2014we begin to understand this book\u2019s place in American culture.The designers have imported Mr. Knight\u2019s deft illustrative style. Old hotel phones here offer       Bernadette Peters       reciting excerpts from \u201cEloise\u201d and lesser-known sequels\u2014\u201cEloise in Paris\u201d (1957), \u201cEloise at Christmastime\u201d (1958) and \u201cEloise in Moscow\u201d (1959). One gallery includes a life-size replica of the Plaza\u2019s elevator man worriedly looking as if a crew of Eloise wannabes is about to invade.A reading area is stocked with Eloise books and others Mr. Knight illustrated, along with Eloisian artifacts: a one-eyed doll that she sawed in two and an empty bottle of gin. Mr. Knight\u2019s trial drawings of Eloise suggest her knowing smile and overactive imagination in a half-dozen pencil strokes. He was born in New York to equally talented parents: His mother, Katherine Sturges Knight, displays a \u201cvibrant decorative sensibility\u201d; his father,       Clayton Knight,        specialized in aviation art.We see too, how close Eloise is to Ms. Thompson, who is called here \u201ca multi-talented boundary pusher.\u201d A piano prodigy who performed with the St. Louis Symphony, she became mentor to       Judy Garland,        and was vocal coach to both Lena Horne and       Frank Sinatra.       She had five nose jobs and (not unjustly) still thought she looked like       Basil Rathbone.       In the early 1950s she was the highest paid cabaret singer around. She appeared in \u201cFunny Face\u201d (1957)\u2014a clip is shown here.Eloise was part of her personality. Through much of her own self-created life\u2014she was born       Catherine Fink       to a Jewish pawnbroker in St. Louis in 1909\u2014she regularly channeled the voice of that 6-year-old when she wanted to break down opposition. When \u201cEloise\u201d was adapted for television in 1956, Ms. Thompson resented the child actress and insisted on being her dubbed-in voice\u2014a grotesque arrangement ultimately discarded.One attraction here is Mr. Knight\u2019s 1956 painting of Eloise, mounted at the Plaza Hotel until, in 1960, it vanished; it turned up two years later, in a dumpster and was restored for this show. Thompson\u2019s biographer, Sam Irvin, suggests it was all a stunt cooked up by Thompson, getting Eloise into the news as       Dr. Seuss       books and Barbie dolls were eclipsing her.Thompson\u2019s petulance is as clear as her gifts. Mr. Knight was not permitted to re-create images until after Thompson\u2019s death in 1998. (She also pulled the three sequels out of circulation and never completed the fourth, published posthumously as \u201cEloise Takes a Bawth.\u201d) Such are Eloise\u2019s progenitors.Ms. Thompson must have also been aware of at least one other: Ludwig Bemelmans\u2019s \u201cMadeline\u201d (1939), the subject of another show curated by Ms. Curley in 2014. Both books led to sequels; both inspired merchandising (this exhibition ends in a gift shop); and both celebrated girls who would never consent to walking in two straight lines, in rain or shine. Bemelmans, like Thompson, was also enticed by hotels\u2014designing for the Waldorf-Astoria, creating murals for the Carlyle Hotel.In writing \u201cMadeline\u201d a German-born American immigrant chose an Old World setting for his tales of iconoclastic mischief; in creating \u201cEloise,\u201d a St. Louis-born lower-class child, later an emigrant into the upper-class social world, gives us a French chateau-like setting also ripe for disruption. Eloise calls herself a \u201ccity child,\u201d but what we see is the American child rebelling against the Old World: self-created, self-governed\u2014ready for encounters with cats in hats and Sendakian wild things.

Rising government bond yields helped lift banks further this past week, as rising interest rates can boost bank profits.The gains offset losses by energy companies, which were weighed down by a drop in the price of oil.The S&P 500 finished the week up less than 0.1%, with the financials sector posting a 1.5% gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and             Nasdaq Co      mposite gained 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, for the week.On Friday, the Dow industrials added 94.30 points, or 0.4%, to 21414.34. The Nasdaq Composite added 63.61 points, or 1%, to 6153.08 as the recently volatile tech sector swung higher, and the S&P 500 added 15.43 points, or 0.6%, to 2425.18.Financials climbed Friday after Labor Department data showed U.S. hiring picked up more than expected in June, even as wage gains stalled.The jobs report is a key data point for the Federal Reserve that will help the central bank determine its plans for raising short-term interest rates further and reducing its asset portfolio. While jobs growth jumped from the prior month, some analysts homed in on how average hourly earnings growth for private-sector workers was little changed from prior months.\u201cThis report speaks to a central Fed argument,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco, referring to wage growth in June, which she called underwhelming. \u201cThat is, is inflation transitory? Should we be worried that lower inflation has appeared over the last few months?\u201dStill, Ms. Hooper said such a big increase in hiring in the month suggests the jobs recovery following the financial crisis has more room to run.The monthly jobs report is less critical for the stock market now compared with several years ago, as the Fed has raised short-term rates multiple times and is likely to raise them again in 2017. However, stock investors say the report still matters, as it provides a window into the labor market and the pace of economic growth, both of which can affect stock prices.Nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 222,000 from the prior month and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% from 4.3%, the Labor Department said Friday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected 174,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate to be 4.3%.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note bounced around slightly in the wake of the jobs report, and settled at 2.393%, up from 2.369% on Thursday. The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, rose 0.2%.Hawkish signals from policy makers in Europe and the U.S. have roiled markets in recent days as investors gauge how fast central banks will be moving away from their ultra-accommodative monetary policies put in place after the financial crisis. Minutes from the European Central Bank\u2019s last meeting released Thursday showed officials are considering dropping a pledge to accelerate bond purchases.\u201cPeople are taking note of what signals central banks are sending,\u201d said Lefteris Farmakis, macro strategist at UBS. \u201cIf central banks rush the tightening, markets will suffer a lot.\u201dIn commodities, U.S.-traded crude oil prices fell 2.8% to $44.23 a barrel, after data on Thursday showed that U.S. oil production rebounded last week. Oil prices ended the week down 3.9%.Falling oil prices weighed on energy shares in Europe on Friday, and the Stoxx Europe 600 edged down less than 0.1%. The index was up 0.2% for the week, its largest gain in about a month.Japan\u2019s Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.3%, while Hong Kong\u2019s             Hang Seng                   Index shed 0.5% Friday.

The market dropped 6% in just three sessions, undermining what some had hoped was a long-coming turnaround.Instead, bearish traders are returning quickly, brokers said, re-establishing a downward trend that took oil into a bear market this spring when many had predicted a steady rally toward $60 a barrel. Most of the issues this week are the same as they have been for months\u2014the ineffectiveness of major output cuts by the world\u2019s biggest exporters and rising U.S. production--- with a strong dollar now hurting, too.\u201cIt all adds up to sell, sell, sell. It\u2019s a long list of bearish\u201d factors, said Donald Morton, senior vice president at Herbert J. Sims & Co., who runs an energy-trading desk.Light, sweet crude for August delivery settled down $1.29, or 2.8%, at $44.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the global benchmark, lost $1.40, or 2.9%, to $46.71 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Both had their seventh-lowest settlement of the year.Both also lost ground for the sixth time in the last seven weeks. U.S. oil fell $1.81, or 3.9% a barrel this week. Brent lost $2.06, or 4.2%, its biggest percentage loss for any week in two months.Friday\u2019s sharpest decline came early, in concert with a dollar surge that started after the monthly U.S. employment report. Nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 222,000, more than the 174,000 economists had expected, the Labor Department said Friday morning. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, rose afterward and was recently up 0.2%A stronger dollar makes dollar-traded oil more expensive for foreign buyers. Oil futures often fall when that happens.The market already was weighed down by a selloff that began Thursday afternoon. Prices had initially rallied in that session after the U.S. government reported crude levels in U.S. storage fell by 6.3 million barrels in the week ended June 30, nearly three times what analysts had predicted. But the data also showed a sharp rise in U.S. production, and bearish traders took advantage of the rally to return to the market and sell from a higher price, brokers said.That fits a pattern that emerged earlier this year when sporadic, but sometimes very large drawdowns from storage often didn\u2019t lead to strong rallies and sometimes led to selloffs. That has surprised many because drawdowns are typically considered a bullish signal of lower supply. Traders who move based on momentum, especially computerized-trading systems, have caught on to the recent, counterintuitive pattern and are selling as they have done several times this year, brokers said.\u201cIt definitely reinforces the notion that momentum is at best sideways but really \u2026 just negative,\u201d said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group in Houston.Markets are concerned that agile U.S. producers are increasing production, says       Michael McCarthy,        chief markets strategist CMC Markets. Data from the EIA also showed U.S. production increased to nearly 9.34 million barrels a day last week, from 9.25 million barrels a day the week before. Production was up nearly 11% from a year ago and nearly back at its 10-month high.\u201cThe rally\u2026maybe it was a step too far,\u201d said       Warren Patterson,        commodities strategist at ING Bank.Friday\u2019s updated rig count from             Baker Hughes Inc.       also showed another in a lengthy string of increases. Oil producers added seven more rigs to their working fleet, which rose to 763, up more than double from the 351 at work a year ago.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of (bearish traders) that were in this market that got squeezed last week, and ultimately they want to be back in,\u201d said Bill Baruch, senior strategist at Chicago brokerage iiTrader.Concerns are also re-emerging about a deal from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other major exporters to cut output by around 1.8 million barrels a day. That was supposed to lead prices higher, but traders said rising production from members with exemptions from the deal and the U.S., which isn\u2019t part of it, are going to prevent OPEC from really shrinking world oversupply and bloated stockpiles.OPEC is considering putting a limit on how much oil members Nigeria and Libya can pump, cartel delegates say. Libya\u2019s crude-oil output has surged to more than one million barrels a day, up from 400,000 in October, while Nigeria\u2019s output has risen to 1.6 million barrels a day, up 200,000 barrels a day since October, according to JBC, a Vienna-based energy-industry consultancy.In June OPEC exported more crude than it had in October, the reference level for the deal, data-tracking firm ClipperData said Friday morning. It reported global crude exports are up 10% from a year earlier, with every country in OPEC but Algeria and Qatar raising exports in that span.\u201cWhile hope springs eternal, reality bites,\u201d Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, wrote about OPEC\u2019s attempt to raise prices.Gasoline futures lost 3.03 cents, or 2%, to $1.4984 a gallon. They lost 1.53 cents, or 1%, for the week.Diesel futures lost 3.37 cents, or 2.3%, to $1.4482 a gallon.

A police officer fired a warning shot after he was attacked, police said. Hamburg\u2019s top security official said a small group of perpetrators had left \u201ca trail of destruction.\u201dThe violence scattered across the city, which left at least 196 police officers and an unspecified number of others injured, cast a shadow over a summit meeting that German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       had hoped would produce a message of global harmony.\u201cI have complete understanding for peaceful protests, but violent protests endanger people\u2019s lives,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cThis is not acceptable.\u201dAbout a dozen burnt cars stood on and around the Elbchaussee, one of this wealthy port city\u2019s best-known thoroughfares, by Friday evening. Some residential buildings and nearby banks and an Ikea furniture store had their windows smashed.First Lady       Melania Trump,        who couldn\u2019t be driven to an event for leaders\u2019 partners because of the protests, posted on             Twitter                  : \u201cThinking of those hurt in #Hamburg protests. Hope everyone stay safe!\u201dAs images of the chaotic demonstrations and the police deploying pepper spray and water cannons spread around the world, criticism of the authorities\u2019 reaction and the government\u2019s planning spread in Germany.       Katja Kipping,        chairwoman of the left-wing Left Party, said authorities were guilty of a \u201cmartial operation and an exorbitant limitation of the right to protest.\u201d\u201cThe G-20 summit shouldn\u2019t have been held in a city of a million people such as Hamburg,\u201d conservative lawmaker       Hans-Peter Uhl       told the Bild daily. \u201cThe security situation is much harder to control there.\u201dSome of the most intense violence occurred in Hamburg\u2019s Altona section.\u201cSmall groups of masked perpetrators of violence left a trail of destruction in parts of Altona,\u201d Interior Minister       Andy Grote       said. \u201cI have to say that the high degree of criminal energy and the potential for violence that erupted in Altona this morning is something that must shock all of us.\u201dProtesters criticized that Hamburg was chosen as a venue and said police haven\u2019t handled the situation right.\u201cIt\u2019s negligent to hold this event in the middle of a left-wing stronghold,\u201d said Mirko Shokr, a 19-year-old student from Hamburg, who hit the streets to protest against the G-20 summit Thursday and Friday. \u201cPolice have provoked the escalation. But I am also frustrated that the extremists dressed in black destroyed Altona.\u201dLocals were upset that the G-20 led to massive disruptions in the city\u2019s public transportation system, leaving some like Thorsten Kautz stranded in the city center when police interrupted subway and train connections after riots intensified Friday afternoon.\u201cI simply can\u2019t get home, the subway service was\u200bstopped, the road is blocked,\u201d said Mr. Kautz\u200b, a 50-year-old gardener at the end of his working day. \u201cI\u2019m really upset. I have no idea what this whole G-20 is supposed to do, it only creates trouble for everybody.\u201dGerman politicians have voiced concern for months that violence could accompany the G-20 summit. The annual meeting of world leaders typically draws anti-globalization protests, but this year tensions are particularly high\u2014with Mr. Trump, Mr. Putin, and Turkish President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       all provoking discontent. In addition, the meeting is taking place in the middle of a northern German metropolis that has long been a hot spot for anarchists.In what officials have described as the city\u2019s largest police action in history, some 20,000 officers are on the ground to provide security for the 36 summit delegations and roughly 6,500 participants. Security officials said they expected 8,000 potentially violent, left-wing extremists to travel to Hamburg.Around 16 political rallies against the G-20 have been planned, including protests against the U.S. intentions to build a wall to Mexico and anticapitalism rallies.\u201cWe have heard quite a lot of what\u2019s going on in the streets,\u201d said European Commission President       Jean-Claude Juncker.       \u201cIt\u2019s not as if we are blind and deaf as we go through Hamburg, we have been listening very carefully indeed, as people try and influence the outcome of the summit.\u201dMany of the protests were peaceful. Four separate gatherings protesting Hamburg\u2019s trade industry\u2014the city is home to a major port\u2014took place largely without incident, police said. But in some cases, in addition to hundreds of people trying to block streets, people attacked the authorities\u2014including officers guarding the Park Hyatt, where according to German media reports Mr. Putin is staying.Write to Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.com and Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.comAppeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'Protests Bring Violence, Chaos.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 16:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hamburg-police-call-for-reinforcements-as-g-20-protests-escalate-1499427163", "news_title": "Nearly 200 Injured in Violent G-20 Protests in Germany ", "keywords": "anarchists, anti capitalist protests,group of 20, hamburg, merkel, putin, trump, welcome to hell,Group of 20,Donald Trump,assault,political,general news,civil unrest,climate change,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,natural environment,global,world issues,politics,domestic politics,risk news"}, {"content": "The market\u2019s latest flash crash occurred in silver Thursday evening, with futures falling nearly 10% in several minutes before quickly reversing almost all of that decline.Market players said the drop was likely set off by a trading error.Shortly after 7 p.m. ET\u2014a time when typically less than 100 contracts change hands\u20145,000 additional contracts were sold at once, said       Ross Norman       of gold dealer Sharps Pixley. Then in the next few minutes, about 5,000 additional contracts changed hands in smaller deal sizes.Silver fell from just over $16 per troy ounce to around $14.30 in moments, before quickly getting back to $15.80. The most active Comex silver futures fell 1.5% to $15.425 per troy ounce Friday in New York, settling at the lowest level in 15 months.There have been cases in recent years of a buy or sell order being entered for an asset\u2014be it stock, commodity or bond\u2014at a seemingly wrong price and resulting in subsequent trades. The result has been brief market tumult.If the drop \u201chad real volumes behind it, [prices] would not have bounced back so quickly,\u201d said       Stuart Ive       of OM Financial. \u201cIt suggests trading error rather than anything more serious at this point of time.\u201dBut Sharps Pixley\u2019s Mr. Norman said, \u201cIt could be a deliberate move. It happened when the market was illiquid.\u201dThere was a smaller 1% decline that happened in seconds early in European trading on June 26 that some think was also caused by a trading error, though prices didn\u2019t immediately rebound.The sudden drop in silver Thursday followed a similar selloff in gold two weeks ago, fanning concerns over trading precious metals, market participants said. On June 29, gold prices slid $20 an ounce before recovering, on a large sell order at a time when there were few buyers and sellers in the market.The most-infamous flash crash is the May 6, 2010 plunge in U.S. stocks, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell some 600 points in minutes, putting the day\u2019s slump at nearly 1,000. But the blue-chip index soon reversed nearly all of that 600-point plunge.Such moves are frustrating to traders, who may be forced out of their bets when prices fall past a certain point and they need to sell or put up more money to keep the position, said Jim Wyckoff, senior market analyst at Kitco Metals.\u201cThey\u2019re not common, but unfortunately they\u2019re not rare anymore either,\u201d he said. \u201cThe damage is done to a lot of these guys.\u201dPrecious metals, which are often bought by investors for protection against geopolitical risks or economic turmoil, have been shunned lately as signs of global growth encourage betting on riskier assets. Gold and silver have also suffered as the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates twice this year, and has indicated plans to raise rates once more in 2017.Silver has fallen for five out of the past six sessions, and is down more than 3% year to date. Gold futures for August delivery fell 1.1% to $1,209.70 a troy ounce, settling near a four-month low Friday.\u201cPeople are kind of squeamish on metals\u201d now, said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.\u2014Stephanie Yang contributed to this article.Write to Kevin Kingsbury at kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com and Biman Mukherji at biman.mukherji@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 16:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/silver-futures-plunge-rebound-in-flash-crash-1499395939", "news_title": "Silver Futures Plunge, Rebound in Flash Crash", "keywords": "silver, silver flash crash, silver markets, silver prices,commodity markets,metals markets,gold markets,commodity,financial market news,precious metals markets,silver markets"}, {"content": "Sergio Garcia really, really likes that green jacket he picked up in Augusta in April.The 37-year-old Spaniard spent nearly 20 years trying to win his first major championship, and when he finally won the Masters this spring, he savored the triumph and all its attendant honors and privileges.One of those privileges is the right to take the Augusta National club jacket \u2014a green boxy thing that will win no style awards\u2014home for the year. After the first 12 months, the jacket is returned and kept safe in the champion\u2019s locker at the clubhouse at the end of Magnolia Lane.Most green jacket winners don\u2019t do much more than enjoy it in the privacy of their own homes, though Phil Mickelson did apparently drive to a Krispy Kreme wearing his once and Bubba Watson wrapped his baby in his. Former club chairman Clifford Roberts famously scolded Gary Player for leaving his in South Africa, then warned him not to wear it in public.For Garcia the green jacket appears to have become a staple of his wardrobe. He wore it to a recent Real Madrid-Barcelona soccer game and showed up to the BMW International Open last month in the blazer. Then Friday Garcia was courtside at Wimbledon to watch his countryman Rafael Nadal dispose of Karen Khachanov in straight sets wearing, you guessed it, the green jacket.To be fair, 2016 Masters champion Danny Willett wore his to the All England Club last year, but other than for some family photos, he seems to have followed traditional decorum.Garcia, not so much.

In the more than ample list of novels about writers, \u201cNew Grub Street\u201d is one that gets it right. It is not the usual story of egos, betrayals and bad behavior; it\u2019s about the sheer work of writing. Gissing presents us with a gallery of striving scribblers for whom daily existence in 19th-century London is yet another iteration of the new world of industrial labor. With steady sympathy and wit, Gissing brings us into the ink-stained lives of writers who teeter on the precipice of disaster. His voice ricocheting between sarcasm and sympathy, Gissing writes: \u201cIt was very weak of Harold Biffen to come so near perishing of hunger as he did in the days when he was completing his novel. But . . . he did not starve for the pleasure of the thing, I assure you.\u201d Despite the frustration seething at its heart, the novel is elegant, suspenseful and strangely inspiring\u2014the writers here might all end up on time\u2019s remainder table, but they are dear and brave enough to be heroes.By       Joshua Ferris       (2007)2. It\u2019s no secret that the people we work with become a kind of surrogate family, and no novel better captures this phenomenon than this one. Written with a blend of compassion and high wit, it takes on office life at the end of the 1990s boom and at once embraces and satirizes that life in a weirdly omnipotent voice, as if the collective spirit of the office is telling the story. \u201cOur desks were waiting, we had work to do. And work was everything. We liked to think it was family, it was God. . . . But at two in the afternoon with bills to pay and layoffs hovering over us, it was all about the work.\u201d The meetings, the emails, the utter unimportance of the projects (\u201cWe wandered the hallways carrying papers that indicated some mission of business when in reality we were in search of free candy\u201d), and all the while Mr. Ferris\u2019s air-conditioned voice is inviting your laughter, so as to more thoroughly\u2014when the moment arrives\u2014break your heart.By       John Williams       (1965)3. Despite being published in the mid-1960s and titled \u201cStoner,\u201d John Williams\u2019s great novel about being a teacher is about as far from Day-Glo psychedelia as a novel can be. As austere as a Shaker bench, it tells the life story of William Stoner, a professor of English at the University of Missouri. Love affairs, war and madness shape Stoner\u2019s life, but through it all nothing takes precedence\u2014either for the character or his creator\u2014over teaching young students to read and to think. \u201cBut don\u2019t you know, Mr. Stoner?\u201d a professor asks him early in the novel when he is still a student himself. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand about yourself yet? You\u2019re going to be a teacher.\u201d Understanding oneself is largely what this uniquely unsettling novel is about. At times, the portrait is almost unbearably sad. \u201cWithin a month he knew that his marriage was a failure; within a year he stopped hoping that it would improve.\u201d Even at the end, when Stoner contemplates his own demise, his stoicism persists. Faced with his own shortcomings, he asks himself quite simply, \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d In his impassioned passivity, Stoner is brilliant to behold. The novel is a monument to the men and women like him, a praise song for those who show up and do their job and a radical redefinition of the meaning of success.By       Pat Barker       (1991)4. A psychiatrist is at the heart of Pat Barker\u2019s moving novel, the first book in her great trilogy set during World War I. At Craiglockhart War Hospital, Dr. William Rivers does the painstaking and haunting work of mending the psyches of traumatized young men enough for them to return to the front lines. Rivers is a heroic figure, a just man in an unjust system, in a workplace that is equal parts heaven and hell. His patients\u2014some of them, like Rivers, based on real people\u2014exist simultaneously in the rooms of the hospital and in the trenches with the dead as Rivers takes them through the talking cure. His goal is to lead them toward an understanding \u201cthat horror and fear were inevitable responses to the trauma of war . . . that tears were an acceptable and a helpful part of grieving.\u201d This incandescently humane novel never allows us to forget where else Rivers is leading the men in his care\u2014right back to the trenches.By       Karl Marlantes       (2009)5. Karl Marlantes began writing \u201cMatterhorn\u201d 30 years before it was published. It\u2019s a big book, nearly 600 pages, as majestic as \u201cWar and Peace\u201d but without the peace. In this meticulous, terrifying re-creation of war, we suffer hour by hour with a small band of soldiers in Vietnam who are trying to take a strategically worthless mountain in a jungle rife with predators bacterial, animal and human. Here is the commander\u2019s point of view, not quite halfway into the novel: \u201cMellas wanted to look at his map. If he could see the contour lines of Hill 1609 drawn on the map, it would help him feel that it and the company were still really there. In this darkness, it was a dream. There was only this ground, this smell, this small group of humans.\u201d Mr. Marlantes depicts the job of a soldier as pure labor: It\u2019s not a noble crusade, or a romantic calling, just long hours and lousy pay, with your chances of advancement roughly the same as your chances of extinction.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 15:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/scott-spencer-1499456630", "news_title": "Scott Spencer", "keywords": "bookcar0708,book review,books,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Among cycling aficionados,       Peter Yates\u2019s       1979 film \u201cBreaking Away\u201d was a welcome vehicle to convey the elegance of the sport to a largely oblivious American audience. Like most sports films, it was also something more: the story of a man struggling to break away from the provincialism of family and friends, along with a morality tale about how everyone lies a little and some people cheat a lot.In \u201cKnowing the Score,\u201d King\u2019s College philosopher       David Papineau       uses bike racing and other sports as metaphors for lessons about the most important issues in philosophy and life. He confesses his ignorance of cycling and admits that he did not understand, when watching the 2012 Olympic road race, why four women cyclists from different countries would work together after they broke away from the peloton. Mr. Papineau finds an answer in game theory, the analysis of competition and cooperation between rational actors in a conflict situation. Cyclists drafting one another create a significant savings in energy and an increase in speed, so solo breakaways are unusual and almost always fail.By David Papineau  Basic, 285 pages, $27Drafting in the middle of the pack for the entire race is very efficient, but then you have to sprint for the win against the entire field. Ideal is a small breakaway with, say, four riders: Each can conserve energy and only has to beat three others to win. In game-theory terms, it pays for each of the four racers to cooperate with one another until the very end. If one rider \u201cdefects\u201d (in game-theory terms) and refuses to take a pull at the front, the others will punish her, verbally or by other means. Occasionally, in the final kilometer, everyone in the breakaway refuses to pull through in order to conserve energy for the sprint, and the group gets caught by the hard-charging peloton, an example of selfishness surmounting selflessness to the detriment of all. On the other hand, knowing that this can happen discourages early defection and keeps the provisional mutualism going.Each chapter in Mr. Papineau\u2019s engaging book takes a look at a philosophical problem like this, presented by a sport, and links it to phenomena in the wider world. The author finds cyclists\u2019 conflicts between self-interest and group interest to be mirrored in relations between nations: Agreements attempting to combat climate change, for instance, face a collective-action problem that must contend with \u201cbreakaway\u201d nations that desire greater economic growth. In other sections, failure to meet political obligations in a society is equated to fouls in an athletic contest; sporting competition among nations is connected to geopolitical rivalry (      George Orwell       once commented that sport \u201cis war minus the shooting\u201d); nature and nurture are discussed in terms of athletic performance and life (gifted athletes have gifted children, but not equally so). Mr. Papineau also applies economic concepts, like Coase\u2019s theorem\u2014stating that free markets with well-defined rules lead to relative efficiency\u2014to sports, in which the best players migrate to the best teams and earn the most money unless an artificial mechanism like a draft is devised so as to level the playing field.Another lesson that Mr. Papineau\u2019s book imparts is that athletic contests are not just another form of play. Most people want more than just a happy existence. We want challenges to face and obstacles to overcome. Our ancestors got more of those from daily life than we do today, so we need artificial trials. Sports are, in that sense, the very embodiment of the human striving that brings meaning to life.\u2014Mr. Shermer is the author, most recently, of \u201cSkeptic: Viewing the World With a Rational Eye.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-07 15:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/game-theories-1499456552", "news_title": "Game Theories", "keywords": "bookcar0708,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,sports,recreation,routine general news,reviews"}, {"content": "A mysterious young man, bearing the all but anonymous name of Smith, a passenger from London, arrives in colonial New York in the winter of 1746 and goes straight to the merchant house of Lovell & Van Loon, where he presents a bill from a London merchant house that will allow him to receive funds. But the bill is for \u00a31,000, an enormous sum. Moreover, there is no cover letter. The bill may not be genuine, and Smith may be a rogue.Lovell and his partner Van Loon are in a quandary. A compromise is reached. The bill will be held for 30 days, by which time confirmation may, or may not, have arrived from England. Meanwhile, Smith is advanced a modest sum to support him while he waits and is invited to a family dinner with the Lovells and Van Loons, a dinner that will serve as a sort of test. When there, however, Smith gives no indication of what he intends to do with the \u00a31,000 if the bill proves genuine.By Francis Spufford  Scribner, 302 pages, $26It\u2019s an intriguing opening to what proves to be a notably well-crafted novel. For \u201cGolden Hill,\u201d       Francis Spufford      \u2014an English writer previously known for nonfiction works, including \u201cUnapologetic,\u201d a defense of Christianity, and \u201cRed Plenty,\u201d a study of the Soviet Union in 1960\u2014has devised an elegant plot (with an agreeable twist). He has also devised an adventure story packed with dramatic incident. But the novel is very much a literary work, too, echoing classic novelists of the 18th century, notably Fielding and Smollett. The dialogue has an 18th-century ring as well but manages to achieve a distinctive individual tone.Mr. Spufford would, I fancy, agree with       Walter Scott,        who saw that the chief purpose of a plot is to enable the author to bring in \u201cfine things\u201d; and there are fine things aplenty in \u201cGolden Hill.\u201d The finest may be its evocation of colonial New York, a turbulent city of only 7,000 inhabitants, at a time when New Yorkers still thought of themselves as loyal subjects of King George but when there was already disagreement and rivalry between the elected citizen-assembly and the colony\u2019s governor, who was the king\u2019s representative.In the novel, the governor\u2019s secretary, Septimus Oakeshott, becomes a suspicious yet friendly guide to Smith. He warns Smith that New York \u201cis a place where things can get out of hand very quickly: and often do. You would think, talking to the habitants, that all the vices and crimes of humanity had been left behind on the other shore.\u201d Not so, however: The city\u2019s residents are \u201cwild, suspicious, combustible\u2014and the devil to govern.\u201d The word \u201ccombustible\u201d is apt, as Smith will discover. Moreover, Septimus warns, \u201cthere are few quicker [than New Yorkers] to get a scent of anything . . . odd . . . about a fellow.\u201d Smith is decidedly odd, or at least his situation is. Finally, Septimus says, \u201cthe courts are, if anything, more savage than those at home.\u201d Smith will come close to discovering how true these words are, too.The potential for romance hovers just off-stage: The merchant Lovell has two daughters, the blond Flora, who is docile and eager for marriage, and the dark Tabitha, who is sharp of wit and tongue. But Smith seems to have more urgent purposes in mind, and he arouses interest (or suspicion) wherever he goes. The governor has Septimus and his black servant-slave, Achilles, keep an eye on him. The city\u2019s chief justice interrogates Smith adroitly over a game of cards (piquet) and suspects that he may be a spy for the crown\u2014or he may be a Jacobite agent serving the cause of Prince Charles Edward, who is threatening to regain the throne of Britain for his father, the exiled Stuart Pretender.A spell in jail is almost obligatory for the hero of a novel by Fielding or Smollett, and Smith will indeed run afoul of the law. But \u201cGolden Hill\u201d differs from its models in one crucial respect: It is not a picaresque story of its hero\u2019s wanderings but a taut drama. There is indeed violent action\u2014an angry mob, a duel\u2014but essentially it\u2019s a mystery novel, the question being what Smith\u2019s purpose is, what he will do with the money if his bill proves genuine, and what will become of him if it isn\u2019t.Mr. Spufford\u2019s research has been thorough and is so thoroughly absorbed that he presents old New York, a small, turbulent merchant city, as if he had walked its streets, drunk in its coffeehouses and taken a boat trip up the mist-shrouded Hudson. Perhaps the setting\u2019s detail isn\u2019t all accurate, and scholarly historians may find flaws or spot mistakes. But it feels accurate and true to life; and this is what matters in a novel.The business of America will be business, as we know, and Mr. Spufford\u2019s New York, while still a colony, is a place built on trade and the credit that keeps goods in motion. One of the chief articles of trade, however, is the buying and selling of people, and this too will occupy Smith\u2019s attention. In this respect and many others, \u201cGolden Hill\u201d is a remarkable achievement\u2014remarkable, especially, in its intelligent re-creation of the early years of what was to become America\u2019s greatest city.\u2014Mr. Massie is the author of \u201cThe Royal Stuarts: A History of the Family That Shaped Britain.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-07 15:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lost-in-old-new-york-1499456364", "news_title": "Lost in Old New York", "keywords": "bookcar0708,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "Although I\u2019m sure it is only vaguely related to any real historical event, the myth concerning the origin of ham is one I love. Supposedly, people buried joints of pork by the seashore\u2014to hide them, keep them cool, keep the bugs off\u2014and when they dug the pieces up later they had been transformed. The salt water had washed over the meat, the pork had drawn in the salt and expelled moisture, and the result, a happy accident, was proto-prosciutto.In \u201cSalted and Cured: Savoring the Culture, Heritage, and Flavor of America\u2019s Preserved Meats,\u201d       Jeffrey P. Roberts       doesn\u2019t repeat this bit of mythology. But in his opening chapter he traces an origin story that goes back even further. Swine were among the first domesticated animals, he notes; they started hanging around the moment we had stationary kitchens. Hunter-gatherers followed seasons and herds, leaving behind whatever they\u2019d used up. Once they settled down, though, piles of trash quickly began to appear.By Jeffrey P. Roberts  Chelsea Green, 275 pages, $27\u201cWild pigs recognized potential foodstuffs in these communities,\u201d Mr. Roberts writes. Pigs can eat everything, after all, and we offered a cornucopia. A man\u2019s kitchen midden is a pig\u2019s buffet. And, properly prepared or preserved, a pig is a meal for a man. Confucius\u2019 students paid cured pork as tuition, Mr. Roberts reports. A few centuries later, Cato the Elder explained how to salt hams in \u201cDe Agri Cultura\u201d (\u201cOn Farming\u201d). \u201cThe techniques he described,\u201d Mr. Roberts says, \u201care still the basic recipe used today to make both prosciutto di Parma and prosciutto di San Daniele.\u201dAfter this historical primer, we\u2019re on to the stories of America\u2019s chefs and charcutiers, the real meat of this book. Although Mr. Roberts makes it clear that he didn\u2019t talk to every single person with a butcher knife and a curing program in America, he seems to have given it a good try. If, like me, you build food-based travel itineraries, you need a copy of \u201cSalted and Cured.\u201dAmerican charcuterie begins on the banks of the Pagan River in Virginia, in the town of Smithfield. The Powhatan tribe treated fish and game with sea salt harvested from tidal flats. From early colonial times, Mr. Roberts writes, \u201ctheir techniques meshed with British traditions, and cured, smoked ham became a staple throughout the South.\u201d Mr. Roberts covers the growth of the industrial Smithfield Packing Co. before bringing us two tales of tradition and brilliance in the stories of S. Wallace Edwards & Sons and North Carolina\u2019s Johnston County Hams.Mr. Roberts can be authoritative but loves each plate of charcuterie more than the last and frequently peppers his text with writerly hand claps and exclamation points: \u201cHoly flying pig!\u201d he exclaims when confronted with a Johnston-cured haunch of Mangalitsa hog.After Virginia, he goes to Kentucky (dropping in on Col. Bill Newsom\u2019s and Broadbent\u2019s) and then Tennessee (Benton\u2019s Smoky Mountain Country Hams). He heads to New Orleans for Cajun boudin sausage, chases spicy \u2019Nduja in Chicago and tracks down salami in Denver. He is just as comfortable in the Jersey Pork Store as he is in New York\u2019s Gramercy Tavern.It\u2019s delightful that so many craftspeople and cooks are keeping alive these traditions. But why do they do it? In a technical sense, preservation techniques are no longer needed. \u201cUntil the twentieth century,\u201d writes Mr. Roberts, \u201cdry curing, pickling, cooking, and smoking hams were the available preservation techniques. With most farmers putting up meat, no one looked to country ham as a major money maker; it was simply part of the culture of farming and rural life.\u201d Today, though, we can cryovac and refrigerate and freeze. We do not require the ungainly, exacting process by which fresh meat becomes cured meat.For a while it seemed as if the entire tradition might be sunk and that, as it faded, the American cucina povera might fade along with it. Now the questions are different: how to make production viable, how to raise pigs in the right way, how to train people to process the meat and carry on the traditions laid down by generations. Most important, perhaps, is how to find people willing to pay for the luxury item that charcuterie has now become.To his credit, Mr. Roberts asks tough questions as he tours the landscape, such as: What happens to country ham if we elevate it \u201cto a pedestal similar to what prosciutto or jam\u00f3n are on, with their associated price tags? What happens when we shift the ham from its cultural and historic roots?\u201d Yet the hallmark of this book is his gustatory enthusiasm. It makes Mr. Roberts a spirited traveling companion even if it lands the text in a strange middle ground: At times \u201cSalted and Cured\u201d vacillates between guidebook and memoir. While the reader\u2019s consumption might be smoother if the author had settled on either a narrative or encyclopedic tone, rather than attempting a hybrid, \u201cSalted and Cured\u201d has all that\u2019s needed to help you fill your larder.\u2014Mr. Watman is the author, most recently, of \u201cHarvest: Field Notes From a Far-Flung Pursuit of Real Food.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-07 15:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cures-for-hunger-1499456008", "news_title": "Cures for Hunger", "keywords": "bookcar0708,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,society,community,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Readers of this book are less likely to be drawn to the title (\u201cRoots, Radicals and Rockers\u201d) than its musician author. Billy Bragg came of age in 1980s Thatcherite Britain singing tales of romance and politics in a nasal cockney voice accompanied by equally harsh electric guitar. He became an occasional hitmaker while remaining a committed left-wing polemicist, frequently mining the rich repertoire of international protest songs. In recent years he has turned author. In 2006, Mr. Bragg published \u201cThe Progressive Patriot,\u201d an examination of British identity, and now follows with a hugely ambitious account of the postwar style known as \u201cskiffle,\u201d thereby filling a gaping hole in the literature of 20th-century music.By Billy Bragg  Faber & Faber, 431 pages, $29.95All musical genres of merit have clear-cut images that we associate with the moment from which there was no turning back. For rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, it might be       Elvis Presley       shown from the waist up on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d in January 1957; for rock music,       Bob Dylan       turning electric at the Newport Folk Festival in July 1965; and for punk rock, at least in the U.K., the Sex Pistols swearing on prime-time live TV in December 1976. For \u201cskiffle,\u201d to the extent that such a moment is celebrated at all, it is probably with an image of the Quarrymen, as the future Beatles were then known, performing in November 1957, with       John Lennon       and       Paul McCartney       each on acoustic guitars as part of a five-piece band that includes someone playing a \u201cbroomstick bass\u201d behind them.That image is included in Mr. Bragg\u2019s book as evidence of skiffle\u2019s enormous influence. As with the other aforementioned genres, skiffle had a long and convoluted prehistory. It emerged out of what Mr. Bragg calls the \u201cdreary parsimonious atmosphere\u201d of postwar Britain, where rationing continued until 1954, the lone television station (the BBC) was blatantly paternalistic, pop radio simply did not exist and a mutual ban by British and American musicians unions forestalled all trans-Atlantic tours between 1935 and 1955. As such, when an enthusiastic jazz musician, trumpeter       Ken Colyer,        went to New Orleans by ship in 1952 to hear and perform the music at its source, his journey was the musical equivalent of an Everest expedition. Within weeks of his return, his new group, Ken Colyer\u2019s Jazzmen, were the hottest ticket in the U.K.The Jazzmen engaged in \u201cbreakdown sessions\u201d in between sets, performing American folk, spiritual and blues songs on guitar, stand-up bass and a \u201cwashboard\u201d for percussion. In the summer of 1953, Ken\u2019s brother Bill, a playing member and the Jazzmen\u2019s manager, first applied to this music the term \u201cskiffle\u201d\u20141920s American slang for a rent party.In May 1954, Ken Colyer sought to fire his rhythm section, exasperated in part by its young guitarist, Scottish native Tony \u201cLonnie\u201d Donegan. Donegan was a singer who had a voice like a runaway steam train and a personality to match, and Colyer had forgotten that the group had been established as a cooperative. In the end, it was the Colyers who were exiled instead. Trombonist       Chris Barber       took the helm, and when the group was short of material at a Decca Records session in July 1954, he, Donegan and a washboard player recorded four songs, including a rendition of Lead Belly\u2019s \u201cRock Island Line\u201d that started as spoken story and ended as a musical riot.As so often is the case with popular culture, it was an afterthought that subsequently proved seminal. (Mr. Bragg notes how, a week earlier, at Sun Studios in Memphis, Elvis Presley recorded an off-the-cuff, \u201cskiffle\u201d-like version of \u201cThat\u2019s All Right Mama\u201d when the session\u2019s original mandate, Ernest Tubb\u2019s \u201cI Love You Because,\u201d failed to ignite.) \u201cRock Island Line\u201d was finally released as a single in late 1955, credited to Donegan. Much to the disdain of the stuffy music-business establishment, the song was quickly adopted by Britain\u2019s first generation of postwar teenagers, desperate for music they could call their own.Mr. Bragg works valiantly to join the disparate dots that rendered \u201cRock Island Line\u201d so vital. He devotes chapters to the Anglo-American folk and jazz scenes, American rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, the Angry Young Men of British stage and screen, the effects of the coffee bar,\u00a0and the trendsetting roles of both off-shore \u201cpirate\u201d station Radio Luxembourg and American Forces Network radio. He is ebullient describing scenes at British movie houses during 1956 when       Bill Haley       and His Comets were shown performing in the film \u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d\u2014dozens of \u201cteddy boys\u201d would \u201cjive\u201d in the aisles and, after being ejected for unruly behavior, continue to dance in the streets.Yet Haley was a portly middle-aged man, as audiences discovered when the union bans were finally lifted and the Comets toured Britain. Donegan, by comparison, was in his mid-20s, raffishly handsome and refreshingly provincial. The skiffle sound he popularized offered not just an alternative to American rock \u2019n\u2019 roll but greater accessibility. The only purchase necessary to make it was an acoustic guitar: The washboard and \u201ctub bass\u201d were essentially household items. With the same few songs performed across the land, aspiring musicians only needed enthusiasm to attempt to play skiffle, and just about all of them did.The influence of this music in Britain cannot be overstated. As Donegan piled on the hits, and contemporary groups like the Vipers and youthful imitators like       Tommy Steele       followed him onto the charts, acoustic-guitar sales went through the roof. \u201cI have twenty thousand on order and wish I could get more,\u201d offered one of Britain\u2019s bigger national retailers in mid-1957. Among those lining up were future members of the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks\u2014and the Beatles. Mr. Bragg tells of 13-year-old George Harrison attending all six of Donegan\u2019s first Liverpool shows in November 1956, and 14-year old Paul McCartney saw at least one. John Lennon, whether or not he saw the same concerts, acquired a guitar in the weeks that followed to form his own skiffle group, the Quarrymen. In 1957, Mr. McCartney witnessed the Quarrymen at a village f\u00eate and the rest, as they say, is history.Though Lonnie Donegan did become an American pop star for a while, Mr. Bragg readily admits that \u201cskiffle never took hold\u201d in America. As such, his book\u2019s subtitle\u2014\u201cHow Skiffle Changed the World\u201d\u2014is misleading. Skiffle only really changed Britain. And while the Quarrymen may not have formed without skiffle, they would never have progressed but for American rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, which formed the core of the Beatles\u2019 live shows long after Donegan fell out of fashion.Mr. Bragg\u2019s British worldview is frequently evident, as in his use of the personal possessive when referring to his home country, though such occasional intrusions of personality and opinion serve to enliven a book that can otherwise seem almost scholarly. And his personal touch adds vitality to other sections, as when he likens the skiffle explosion of 1956-57 to that of punk rock precisely 20 years later. Of Donegan\u2019s \u201cFrankie and Johnny,\u201d Mr. Bragg notes: \u201cBy the climax of the song, he\u2019s near-hysterical, exhibiting the loss of vocal control that would later become the hallmark of       Joe Strummer\u2019s       performances with the Clash.\u201d\u201cRoots, Radicals and Rockers\u201d contains more detail than necessary; even the most attentive reader will likely lose track of the many players on the scene. But Mr. Bragg\u2019s knowledge of these personalities, and of the shifting cultural tides that brought them together in skiffle, is nothing short of masterly. It would be hard to cite another historical book of such depth, quality and reasoned analysis by a working, nonacademic musician.\u2014Mr. Fletcher is the author of \u201cAll Hopped Up and Ready to Go: Music From the Streets of New York 1927-77,\u201d among other books.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 15:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/before-the-fab-four-1499455931", "news_title": "Before the Fab Four", "keywords": "bookcar0708,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "It\u2019s the summer of 1965, and Sophie LaBranche, nearly 13 years old, is bracing for the awful moment when her big sister, Lily, goes off to college.

His main character, Aaron, is a former rabbi who was fired for gambling with the synagogue\u2019s funds. He rebounded by becoming an investment manager, having a child with his girlfriend, Amelia (a divorcee, Amelia is reluctant to remarry), and settling them into a gorgeous brownstone in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant.Aaron has mostly stayed away from the bookies since his disgrace, but in his psychologist\u2019s diagnosis his real addiction is to \u201crisk taking\u201d\u2014that\u2019s why he\u2019s gotten more of a charge in moving into this predominantly black neighborhood than he ever did playing the ponies: \u201cBed-Stuy was the best bet he\u2019d ever made. It was a real risk, and a thrilling one. It took guts to be surrounded by people who didn\u2019t look like him, in a neighborhood without the amenities he was accustomed to, but it was worth it. As long as New York City remained desirable . . . the only way he could lose was a spike in crime to scare off new gentrifiers.\u201dMr. Platzer presents a rounded picture of Aaron and Amelia. Both are decent, family-oriented and charitable, and Amelia, a magazine writer, has stretched beyond celebrity profiles to write a sensitive article on Bed-Stuy\u2019s history and architecture. But it\u2019s impossible to shake the author\u2019s characterization of them as high-stakes gamblers, people who don\u2019t see crime and employment rates as numbers that refer to real people around them but only as statistics to factor into the odds of a big payout.In \u201cBed-Stuy Is Burning\u201d the odds go against them. The neighborhood has been set on edge after police killed an unarmed 12-year-old boy, and on the day that most of the novel takes place young men and women, chanting the refrain \u201cTwelve years old ten shots!,\u201d engage in acts of civil disobedience. But a heavy-handed police crackdown inflames them to violence, and soon mobs fan out, looting shops and subjecting brownstones and housing projects to a frenzied auto-da-f\u00e9.A group of rioters comes to Aaron and Amelia\u2019s doorstep. Aaron has left for work\u2014unbeknownst to his wife, he\u2019s had a relapse and gone to the racetrack\u2014but Amelia is upstairs writing while their infant son, Simon, is cared for by his nanny, Antoinette, a widowed mother of one who has recently converted to Islam. To Amelia\u2019s displeasure, they have also had a visit from their African-American neighbor Jupiter, who is courting Antoinette and foresees the trouble to come. \u201cHe knew that if the neighborhood\u2019s anger was to be expressed it would be directed first against the cops and then against white people,\u201d Mr. Platzer writes, underscoring the irony that Amelia is reflexively frightened by the man who is endangering himself to protect her.The violent standoff between the mob and those inside the building is riveting, full of cliffhanger chapter endings and surprise twists. An unstable, gun-toting tenant who rents Aaron and Amelia\u2019s basement arrives to ratchet up the tension, and at one point a teenager named Sara breaks in to evade the police, locking herself in the upstairs office. Mr. Platzer deftly swivels among the clashing points of view, and the climax, in which Aaron returns to disperse the crowd with an improvised sermon, is powerfully done.But the scene is vexing as well. To Aaron, the sermon is his wake-up call to return to the rabbinate. But that it casts him in the role of the redeemed hero highlights just how much he and Amelia have dominated a novel whose flashpoint is police violence against African-Americans. Mr. Platzer attempts to widen his lens in the way of a       Tom Wolfe       extravaganza by inhabiting the perspectives of Antoinette, Jupiter, Sara and others\u2014there are even sections that follow the thoughts of New York Police Commissioner       Bill Bratton.       But these figures seem strictly peripheral. When the book relates, almost as an aside, that the riots have spread so widely that tanks have been called in to contain them, we realize that the story left off the page is larger and more significant than the one that\u2019s on it.In a coda set during the months after the violence, Amelia arranges to pay Sara for access to the young woman\u2019s experiences, which results in a work of career-making reportage. Mr. Platzer is a direct and revealing observer of the habit white Americans have of making themselves the centerpieces of other peoples\u2019 stories. Yet even in this novel, the gentrifiers have still managed to claim the choicest real estate.For David King, the upwardly mobile Jewish businessman of       Joshua Cohen\u2019s       \u201cMoving Kings\u201d (Random House, 240 pages, $26), the idea of voluntarily relocating to a neighborhood in the outer boroughs is anathema, and the very word \u201cgentrifier\u201d sounds \u201cBritish, fancy and goyish.\u201d \u201cTo him,\u201d Mr. Cohen writes, \u201ccrime would always be going up and only statistics lived in Brooklyn. Crown Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant. Their streets were just names on the news, associated with the city\u2019s youngest corpses.\u201dEven so, his company has an interest in those neighborhoods. King is the president of King\u2019s Moving, a do-it-all moving empire that gets called on to clear out the belongings of evicted tenants, which means that King has a warehouse full of reclaimed items. Such sharp practices have led his daughter to all but disown him, and that has spurred him to look elsewhere for family. His search brings him to Israel and his distant cousin Yoav. Young Yoav, like his traumatized best friend Uri, has completed his military service, having fought in the 2014 Gaza War. Since both of these twentysomethings are at loose ends, David helps them to exchange \u201ctheir drabs for denims [and] beat their munitions into passports,\u201d bringing them to New York and giving them jobs moving furniture.There are two halves to this novel. The first is a superbly drawn portrait of King, a man raised in a cramped Queens apartment where his parents argued \u201cin the Yiddish of banged cabinets\u201d who went on to make a fortune at the cost of his soul. Bluff, funny, amoral and likably scrappy\u2014he brings the dented company van to glitzy fundraisers\u2014King seems both archetypal and vividly sui generis.But the book\u2019s second half drops him in order to enact a creaky allegory of Israeli occupation. Yoav and Uri unwittingly reprise their mission in Gaza by helping to dispossess poor evictees. When they do so to a mentally disturbed Vietnam War veteran and convert to Islam, the story moves toward the chaos and conflagration of \u201cBed-Stuy Is Burning.\u201d Mr. Cohen, though a brilliant stylist, is an indifferent dramatist, and these scenes aren\u2019t sharp enough to transcend their symbolism. The idea is that the cycle of violence that afflicts Israel is analogous to the predatory practices of urban capitalism. This is, to put it mildly, a tricky parallel, and Mr. Cohen\u2019s parable-like tale is too sketchy to make it persuasive.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 15:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-new-fiction-1499455448", "news_title": "The Best New Fiction", "keywords": "bookcar0708,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "The first six months of 2017 ended with the fewest traffic fatalities recorded in New York City, marking a milestone for the city\u2019s Vision Zero campaign, which aims to end traffic-related deaths.According to statistics released by the Mayor\u2019s Office, 93 traffic fatalities were recorded between Jan. 1 and June 30, the first time fewer than 100 casualties had been measured in that period.

Hannibal Barca,        a general of unparalleled skill and determination, invaded Italy in 218 B.C., hauling a vast army, including a corps of war elephants, over the snow-clad Alps. Hannibal led that army, a polyglot assemblage of African and Iberian peoples, to three successive victories over numerically superior Roman forces. He inflicted horrific casualties on the Romans and nearly ended their rise to imperial dominion when it had barely begun.By Patrick N. Hunt  Simon & Schuster, 362 pages, $28The third of Hannibal\u2019s wins, at the Battle of Cannae in 216 B.C., was among the most devastating military blows ever struck; perhaps 50,000 Romans were killed in a few hours of fervid fighting. Yet somehow Rome refused to give in. With newly recruited legions and a new general, Scipio, whose brashness and brilliance were a match for those of Hannibal, the Romans chased Hannibal out of southern Italy and back to his native North African haunts.The great duel between Hannibal and Scipio was finally resolved near a town with the stirring name of Zama, near the border between today\u2019s Algeria and Tunisia. Rome\u2019s forces trounced Hannibal there in 202 B.C. and imposed a humiliating surrender on Carthage, though their final destruction of that city, the notorious \u201cCarthaginian peace,\u201d came more than 50 years later at the end of the Third Punic War.Although beaten, Hannibal remained unreconciled to the triumph of Roman arms. In the second phase of his remarkable career, he became a kind of international condottiere, lending his strategic brilliance to rulers in the Greek east who opposed Roman expansion. He remained innovative and entrepreneurial to the end. While leading the naval forces of a certain Prusias of Bithynia, a province in northwest Asia Minor, Hannibal is said to have won a sea battle by tossing baskets of poisonous snakes onto the decks of his adversary. When, late in the 180s B.C., the Romans pressured Prusias into turning Hannibal over, he took poison himself (according to most sources) to avoid being marched captive through the streets of his hated enemy.What was it that drove Hannibal\u2019s lifelong anti-Roman crusade? According to a tale told by the historians       Polybius       and Livy, Hannibal himself described to a king who employed him, late in life, how his father       Hamilcar      \u2014another general who had fought Rome and lost\u2014had taken him, at age 9, to a solemn sacrificial rite and bade him swear eternal enmity to Rome.       Patrick Hunt,        an archaeologist who teaches in Stanford\u2019s continuing-studies program, reimagines this scene in the first chapter of \u201cHannibal,\u201d a chapter titled \u201cThe Vow,\u201d and seems to find in it an explanation of Hannibal\u2019s later career. \u201cThe child Hannibal died that day,\u201d Mr. Hunt writes. \u201cHe would increasingly come to know thereafter that he lived only to see Rome\u2019s destruction.\u201dMr. Hunt\u2019s portrayal of this oath-swearing scene is vivid and stirring, but he prefaces it with a quiet reminder that it cannot be substantiated (\u201cif the story is true\u201d). There are indeed good reasons to doubt its veracity. Even if Hannibal related this tale in the way our sources claim, he did so at a moment when he was suspected of treachery and his life depended on his anti-Roman bona fides; he had good reason to invent it. Or his recounting of the pledge, in a private conversation, might itself have been invented by some later writer, the source that Polybius quarried it from (for he wrote well after all participants were dead). Tales of blood pacts over steaming entrails, after all, make for exciting reading, especially when no one can gainsay them. But Mr. Hunt gives only a slight nod to these reasons for skepticism before foregrounding \u201cthe vow\u201d as a central element of Hannibal\u2019s character.\u201cHannibal\u201d includes many such risky moves. The book is labeled a biography but would have been better conceived as a history of the Second Punic War. Hannibal\u2019s life before the war started is little known from primary sources, so Mr. Hunt is forced to rely on supposition and guesswork in his early chapters. Then, in his penultimate chapter, he speeds through Hannibal\u2019s post-bellum exile, in fact the longest phase of his adult life, in only a few pages. The war is thus the book\u2019s real subject, a conflict that spread into several theaters and did not always involve Hannibal himself.Mr. Hunt is a passable war correspondent but his efforts to keep Hannibal in the spotlight result in some questionable choices. He often claims to know what his main character was thinking or perceiving, or what he \u201cwould have\u201d thought or perceived. The phrase \u201cmust have\u201d is also sometimes deployed, as in: \u201cYoung Hannibal must have adored and worshipped his father\u201d or \u201cThe frustration in Hamilcar\u2019s voice must have now carried through his house\u201d as he contemplated a humiliating peace settlement. Only the hypothetical verb moods stand between such passages and historical fiction.\u201cHannibal\u201d stays closer to the record in its descriptions of military maneuvers and battles, material that is more fully documented in the sources. Even here, though, Mr. Hunt\u2019s impulse to import color sometimes results in peculiarities. He speculates, on no evidence, that a Roman general\u2019s corpse was beheaded after Hannibal\u2019s victory at Lake Trasimene in central Italy, then writes: \u201cThis possible decapitation was eerily symbolic of the now-headless Roman army.\u201d A beheading that is only \u201cpossible\u201d but still \u201ceerily symbolic\u201d is the sort of contortion that results from serving two masters, responsible history and romance.Mr. Hunt could perhaps pull off this straddle if he were a better prose artist, but many of his sentences are as ungainly as African elephants lumbering over the Alps. Some are poorly constructed: \u201cThe Romans now had another masterful tactic working well to keep [Hannibal] running to put out fires among his shrinking allies.\u201d Others are simply bizarre: \u201cOld king Syphax had a young trophy wife to fan both his ardor and his Punic alliance.\u201d In describing the horrors of an all-out infantry clash, Mr. Hunt too often resorts to clich\u00e9 sound effects (screams, moans and the clashing of spears on shields are heard at regular intervals).The cover of \u201cHannibal\u201d features an equestrian statue of a dashing cavalryman, with the title superimposed like a label. Readers be warned: There are no surviving ancient portraits that preserve Hannibal\u2019s features; this image is actually an 18th-century line drawing that only looks like a Roman marble. The illusion is all too much in keeping with Mr. Hunt\u2019s approach throughout the book.\u2014Mr. Romm is the author of, most recently, \u201cDying Every Day: Seneca at the Court of       Nero.      \u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-07 15:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-scourge-of-rome-1499455295", "news_title": "The Scourge of Rome", "keywords": "bookcar0708,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "At the age of 37, Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Tournachon, more commonly known as       Nadar,        went up in a hot-air balloon for the first time. It was a life-changing experience for the Parisian portrait photographer, whose unstinting activities had moved his friend       Charles Baudelaire       to describe him as \u201cthe most astonishing expression of vitality\u201d he had ever seen.The year was 1857, and Nadar was desperate for something to take his mind off his earthly concerns, or at least put them into some kind of perspective. For the past two years he had been waging a bitter\u2014and eventually successful\u2014legal battle against his younger brother, Adrien (himself a photographer), to prevent him from appropriating his pseudonym and using the name \u201c      Nadar jeune.      \u201dIn Nadar\u2019s delightful ragbag book of memoirs, \u201cWhen I Was a Photographer\u201d (which was finally given a sparkling English-language translation two years ago), he recalled his feelings of drifting above the clouds for the first time: \u201cEverything is far away: cares, remorse, disgust. How easily indifference, contempt, forgetfulness drop away from on high\u2014and forgiveness descends.\u201dBy Adam Begley  Tim Duggan, 248 pages, $28For Nadar it was the beginning of a lifelong, frequently perilous love affair with ballooning that resulted in his becoming the first person to take and develop aerial photographs. He also established the world\u2019s first aerial postal service during the Prussian siege of Paris (1870-71).These airborne adventures are given a regrettably brief, if lively, recounting in       Adam Begley\u2019s       \u201cThe Great Nadar.\u201d Mr. Begley\u2019s primary focus, in this first English-language biography of the French polymath (he was also a gifted writer and caricaturist), is on Nadar\u2019s considerable merits as a portrait photographer. Mr. Begley suggests that, by the time Nadar took up photography in the mid-1850s, his half-dozen years of work as a caricaturist had given him a head-start as a portraitist. Nadar also \u201cunderstood intuitively the emerging celebrity culture, the desire to be publicly known, to be visible and recognized now and in the future.\u201dWith his 2014 biography of       John Updike,        Mr. Begley showed that he is a writer who likes to work his way from the outside in. This approach, in \u201cUpdike,\u201d involved nailing down the autobiographical resonance of the author\u2019s novels, short stories, literary criticism and poetry. For \u201cThe Great Nadar,\u201d Mr. Begley has combed through an array of literature, letters, guest books, invitations, drawings and other miscellany to tease out a nuanced portrait of one of the world\u2019s first celebrity artist-entrepreneurs.Above all, though, it is Mr. Begley\u2019s careful study of Nadar\u2019s portraits of famous writers, artists, actors and composers (many of them reproduced here) that recommends \u201cThe Great Nadar\u201d as a window on an era of extraordinary artistic endeavor.Nadar\u2019s first photographic studio was an outdoor one on the Rue Saint-Lazare (wags re-christened it Rue Saint-Nadar). Visitors crossed a reception room, decorated with a half-dozen romantic paintings by       Gustave Dor\u00e9,        before stepping out into a \u201cravishingly beautiful\u201d courtyard garden.It was here that Nadar learned to appreciate all the different ways that natural light could imbue a photograph. As he wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s the artistic appreciation of the effects produced by various qualities of lighting alone or combined\u2014it\u2019s the application of this or that effect according to the nature of the physiognomy that as an artist you aim to reproduce.\u201dOne of Nadar\u2019s first celebrity subjects was Baudelaire, whom he photographed over an eight-year period. Mr. Begley describes these photographs as an \u201celoquent\u201d study of the poet \u201crefining his persona and coping with [the] notoriety\u201d that arose from the publication, in 1857, of \u201cThe Flowers of Evil,\u201d six poems of which were banned in France for decades for their depiction of decadence run amok.Nadar had become friendly with Baudelaire and his fellow poet       G\u00e9rard de Nerval       during his days as a garret-hopping bohemian. It was during this period that his biting political cartoons earned him the nickname \u201ctourne \u00e0 dard\u201d (later shortened to Nadar), meaning one who scores with a dart. Mr. Begley notes that Nadar\u2014one can\u2019t help thinking of       Andy Warhol       a century later\u2014\u201ccultivated an antiestablishment chic meant to entice not only the cultural elite but also anyone who hoped to mix with artists, radicals and . . . bohemians.\u201dNadar was equally adept at photographing women and men. One of his most provocative photographs shows the middle-aged author       Th\u00e9ophile Gautier,        shirt unbutttoned and a hand tucked lewdly down the waistband of his trousers. Nadar\u2019s exquisite pictures of the actress       Sarah Bernhardt,        at the age of 20, capture a sense of both her toughness and vulnerability, while his portraits of       George Sand       delighted the 60-year-old writer so much that they became firm friends.The dead didn\u2019t escape his camera\u2019s focus either. In 1885, Nadar was invited to take a picture of       Victor Hugo       (both shared a hatred of Louis-Napoleon\u2019s autocratic regime) on the great writer\u2019s deathbed. Similarly, Gustave Dor\u00e9, whom Nadar had first made a portrait of as a bright young thing on the brink of fame, was shown on his deathbed wrapped in a white shroud strewn with roses.Mr. Begley is rightly lavish in his praise for Nadar\u2019s early photography and his gift for \u201ccapturing a piercingly accurate psychological likeness.\u201d But he feels that Nadar lost his way in the 1860s, when he upgraded his business and moved to massive new premises on the Boulevard des Capucines. His art suffered, Mr. Begley argues, as he was compelled to produce portraits on an industrial scale to pay off his growing debts. The result was \u201cconventional images lacking the edge and daring and enigmatic beauty of his early work.\u201dBy that point\u2014despite the support of his ever-loyal wife, Ernestine\u2014Nadar seems to have grown disillusioned by his m\u00e9tier. What he started out by calling \u201can art that sharpens the wits of the wisest souls\u201d became for him an \u201cidiot job.\u201dBut Nadar was nothing if not a master of reinvention. He pioneered the practice of aerial photography and became the first photographer to use artificial lighting below ground in the Paris catacombs. With his friend       Jules Verne,        he formed the Society for the Encouragement of Aerial Locomotion to promote the development of so-called heavier-than-air machines.These were all considerable achievements, but Mr. Begley is not convinced. He suggests that \u201cthe sad consequence of [Nadar\u2019s] extracurricular activities in the 1860s is that all these frenetic adventures kept him away from the studio, the place where his true genius had flourished.\u201d Perhaps so, but what made Nadar such a compelling personality\u2014what drew so many disparate personalities toward him\u2014was his range of passionate engagement, his effervescence. Nadar\u2019s \u201ctrue genius\u201d could not be limited to the confines of portrait photography.What made Nadar so entrancing, it seems, was his Wildean propensity for putting talent into his works but genius into his life. One need only read Nadar\u2019s chapter on his first attempt at aerostatic photography in \u201cWhen I Was a Photographer\u201d to grasp the true nature of the man: \u201cWho or what can stop me,\u201d he writes, \u201conce I have given in to one of my sudden bursts of enthusiasm?\u201d\u2014Mr. Grey is a writer based in Paris.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 15:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-great-nadar-1499454926", "news_title": "The Great Nadar", "keywords": "bookcar0708,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Wimbledon, EnglandAt Wimbledon, unusually warm air and sunshine have dried up the famed grass courts and increased patches of dirt. And that means Rafael Nadal actually has a chance to win this thing.Nadal is a legend of clay courts who has struggled in recent years on grass. Knee problems have made the condition worse because, when the grass is fresh and slippery, he can\u2019t move or bend deeply for the ball as quickly or comfortably as he needs.But when the grass thins out and the dirt appears, the ball bounces higher, Nadal\u2019s knees are less stressed and he has a better chance of advancing. Nadal won his third match on Friday, with the heat helping him beat Karen Khachanov, who is 6-foot-6 and hits with brutal power. Nadal wasn\u2019t impressed. He broke Khachanov\u2019s serve three times in the first set on his way to a 6-1, 6-4, 7-6(3) victory. Nadal hit 41 winners and had just 19 errors.Nadal sounds more hopeful than he has in years. \u201cI am excited to be playing again here, in a tournament that I really love,\u201d he said last week. \u201cIf I am able to go through at the beginning, I think I am with confidence.\u201dOn Monday Nadal will play 6-feet 4-inch Gilles Muller, one of the men who beat a young Nadal at Wimbledon. If he wins, his next round will likely be brutal: 6-feet-6 grass-court lover Marin Cilic, seeded seventh and the owner of a deadly serve, long arms and powerful strokes.Considering how Nadal started his career as a clay master, it\u2019s remarkable that he can be dangerous at Wimbledon. When he won his first French Open in 2005, at age 19, Nadal went to Wimbledon with hope. Instead, he looked lost. He hit forehands short and loopy, played mostly on the baseline and swatted somewhat awkward backhands. Muller beat him in the second round, worse than his third-round performance two years before.His losses made sense: Nadal had powerful shots, but also a weak serve and forehands that too often landed short. He needed to change enough aspects of his game that it would have been understandable if he stuck with clay and hard courts.Instead, he worked even harder. The next year, he went for more depth on his forehand and more power in his backhand, shots that keep attackers from controlling him on clay.And once the surface lost grass and became brown dirt, Nadal went to the final.His topspin forehands bounced in a funky way, and he didn\u2019t mind if the opponent\u2019s shots did the same: Nadal had practiced hitting odd bounces on beat-up courts since childhood at the command of his uncle, Toni.In 2008, in his third straight Wimbledon final against       Roger Federer,        Nadal peaked and beat Federer in one of the finest matches in tennis history. The rain-delayed battle ended at 9:16 p.m., just before it would have to be postponed because of darkness.Wimbledon\u2019s courts are prestigious. The surfaces are more firm than those built in the past, when serving and volleying ruled the sport. Players say that bounces remain true more on these grass courts than any other in the world.But they change when patches of grass disappear, giving players the ability to sprint, rather than run. For some, the results are maddening, even for a successful champion like Novak Djokovic, who has won three titles here.\u201cWe came to play on grass, so it\u2019s nice to actually play on grass,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cThe more you play on it, the worse it actually is and worse it gets. Contrary to clay, for example. The more you play on it, the better condition it actually is.\u201dWhat annoys Djokovic allows Nadal to thrive, especially with his knee problems that make him start the tournament with trepidation.\u201cYou have to be a little bit more cautious,\u201d said Grigor Dimitrov, who reached the semifinals in 2014. \u201cYou have to stay a bit lower.\u201dNadal changed his Wimbledon training this year by skipping the main tournaments and working out on a grass court in Mallorca. He started in small steps. \u201cWe decided that for my body is better to have a slower change to the grass,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were practicing little bit more every day.\u201dNadal has had a little luck, too: Soft early round opponents, rather than lowly-ranked, but serve-slamming, grass experts. His first round opponent, Australia\u2019s John Millman, isn\u2019t a striking power. His second round came against Donald Young, a small American with some magic, not missiles.Now that Nadal has survived his first true slugger test against Khachanov, he\u2019ll be thrilled about the Wimbledon changes on Sunday, when no matches are held and the groundskeepers work on the courts. Federer said the adjustment, especially the removal of dead grass, lets players take more risks.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to move from there on and I feel it\u2019s easier to become more aggressive,\u201d Federer said. \u201cWhereas the first week, especially the first two matches, in my opinion, you have to be a bit more careful that you don\u2019t slip away.\u201dNadal reached the Wimbledon final every year he played from 2006 to 2011 and won the title twice (he was absent in 2009). Since then he lost in the second round twice and the first round once. At his best, he fell in the fourth round, which Nadal will play on Monday. Every time he has passed the fourth round here he has gone on to reach the final.\u201cI am happy that I am here playing again in Wimbledon and with positive feelings in terms of health,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-07 15:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nadal-and-his-knees-look-at-home-again-on-the-grass-1499449004", "news_title": "Nadal and His Knees Look at Home Again On the Grass", "keywords": "sports,recreation,tennis,routine general news"}, {"content": "Whole Foods Market Inc.             entertained several suitors and sought a higher share price before accepting         Amazon.com Inc.\u2019soffer to buy the natural-foods grocer.9Supermarket operator Albertsons Cos. was one of two companies and four private-equity firms that sought to make a deal with Whole Foods as the chain fought sagging sales and impatient investors earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the matter.Albertsons and Whole Foods declined to comment.A financial filing that Whole Foods made to investors on Friday shed new light on discussions among Whole Foods executives and advisers over how to handle the multiple bids made in April and May. The document also suggests that \u00a0the company and Chief Executive       John Mackey       went to great lengths to keep those negotiations secret, including forgoing a sales process to avoid publicity.\u201cAmazon.com was very sensitive with respect to confidentiality,\u201d the 173-page proxy states.Amazon declined to comment.Companies started reaching out to Whole Foods in mid-April, about a week after activist investor Jana Partners LLC took an almost 9% stake in the Austin, Texas-based grocer. Jana said at the time that it wanted Whole Foods to more quickly adopt standard grocery-industry practices such as loyalty programs and centralized purchasing to combat a record 18-month stretch of declining same-store sales.Another grocer, referred to as \u201cCompany X\u201d in the filing, wrote to Whole Foods that month expressing interest in possible investment opportunities, and later proposed a merger of equals that would value Whole Foods at between $35 and $40 a share.Albertsons executives at the time were aware that Amazon was also interested in acquiring Whole Foods but couldn\u2019t match the internet giant\u2019s offer, said the person familiar with the deliberations.\u201cAlbertsons couldn\u2019t get there from a price perspective,\u201d the person said.Whole Foods executives didn\u2019t pursue the offers from the private-equity firms because of concerns that they would come in too low and could generate leaks.Amazon originally offered $41 a share for Whole Foods in May, Friday\u2019s filing showed. The grocer responded with a proposal to be acquired for $45 a share. Two days later, on June 1, Amazon raised its bid to $42 and said it would end its acquisition approach if the offer wasn\u2019t accepted.Amazon was also considering other bidding opportunities beyond acquiring Whole Foods, the internet company\u2019s representatives said.Whole Foods accepted that price, which valued the company at a total of about $13.7 billion.

Some bonuses of traders and banking executives classified by the European Banking Authority as \u201crisk takers\u201d won\u2019t be included as a part of severance packages, he said.\u201cOur government\u2019s ambition is to reinforce France\u2019s attractiveness and competitiveness,\u201d said Mr. Philippe. \u201cCompanies must want again to set up and develop their business here,\u201d he added.Paris has stepped up its efforts to win business from financial firms currently based in the U.K. since the election of pro-business       Emmanuel Macron       as French president in May.In addition to tax and labor-cost cuts, the government plans to open three international schools near La D\u00e9fense, the sprawling business district on the Western edge of Paris, and invest in an express train line from Paris\u2019s center to Charles de Gaulle Airport.\u201cThis package of measures meets the expectations voiced over the last months by the financial institutions and international investors that we have met,\u201d said       G\u00e9rard Mestrallet,        the chairman of Paris Europlace, a group that promotes the French capital as a financial center.French labor laws that make it hard to hire and fire workers have become a major hurdle for banks considering relocating business to Paris. Banks that pay hefty bonuses to lure traders and other talent don\u2019t want those sums later factored into severance payments, as is currently required under French law.\u201cThe arrangement with bonuses is that you live by the sword and die by the sword\u2026That\u2019s not the way the law plays it\u201d in France, said       Ross McInnes,        chairman of aerospace firm             Safran SA,       who has been lobbying companies to move to France.So far,             HSBC Holdings                   PLC has said it would transfer about 1,000 jobs to France, where it already has a retail presence.\u201cSenior executives from all the major U.S. and Swiss banks have met with French government officials and regulators in recent months,\u201d said Christian Noyer, former governor of the Bank of France, who was appointed last year by the French government to head a special envoy to defend the country\u2019s financial interests.About 30 asset-management funds have also applied for a license in France, according French Asset Management Association AFG.Paris, however, is facing fierce competition.

Liberals and progressives are therefore not wrong to view the populist movements now roiling Europe and America\u2014Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, the election of       Donald Trump      \u2014as inimical to everything they believe. But although they\u2019re not wrong to see these populist movements as arising from basically conservative impulses, their responses have generally consisted of sarcasm and frenzied outrage and not much more. Here, however, are two brief and lucid books by center-left writers who genuinely want to know what our liberal democratic societies might have done, or failed to do, to provoke these populist revolts.David Goodhart\u2019s       \u201cThe Road to Somewhere\u201d (Hurst, 278 pages, $24.95) deals mainly with last year\u2019s Brexit vote, but his argument has more to do with outlooks and attitudes than economic policies, and for that reason it\u2019s every bit as relevant in the American context. \u201cThe old distinctions of class and economic interest,\u201d he writes, \u201chave not disappeared but are increasingly over-laid by a larger and looser one\u2014between the people who see the world from Anywhere and the people who see it from Somewhere.\u201d Anywheres are university-educated, highly mobile and socially liberal; Somewheres derive their identity from particular places, lack impressive educational backgrounds and find rapid social change unsettling. Like \u201cThe British Dream\u201d (2013), in which Mr. Goodhart suggested to fellow liberals that mass immigration may have unforeseen effects on British society, \u201cThe Road to Somewhere\u201d asks liberals to consider that social changes they\u2019ve cheered for decades might not look like unalloyed blessings to the nation\u2019s Somewheres\u2014in other words its untraveled, uncredentialed majority.In a chapter on the family, for instance, Mr. Goodhart\u2014sounding a lot like an American neoconservative writing 40 years ago in the Public Interest or Commentary\u2014warns that left-liberal values haven\u2019t worked out so well for Somewheres. Elite liberals wanted a more casual view of marriage, and they got it. But it\u2019s more feasible for a woman with a postgraduate degree and a well-paying job with employment benefits to negotiate child-rearing in the absence of a father than it is for a low-income single mom working a service-industry job. Eventually the latter woman may come to believe the system is stacked against her. Because, in a sense, it is.John B. Judis\u2019s       \u201cThe Populist Explosion\u201d (Columbia Global Reports, 182 pages, $12.99) was published just before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, but that improbable victory only confirms the book\u2019s thesis that Western democracies are in some ways failing to represent their citizens. Mr. Judis contends that the forms of populism we\u2019re witnessing in Europe are essentially American in their provenance, the latest manifestation of a tradition running from the original populists\u2014the People\u2019s Party of the 1890s\u2014to       Huey Long\u2019s       Share Our Wealth campaign of the 1920s and 30s and       George Wallace\u2019s       presidential campaigns of the 1960s. All these movements, in Mr. Judis\u2019s interpretation, were expressions of dissatisfaction with the distribution of wealth. In essence, he thinks, these were revolts against economic \u201cneoliberalism.\u201dMr. Judis\u2019s analysis is sharp and engaging on narrow points\u2014he rightly insists, for instance, that the driving forces behind the fascism of the 1930s simply do not obtain today\u2014but the thrust of his argument is almost wholly economic. Mr. Goodhart, I think, is closer to the truth in defining contemporary populism as primarily a cultural phenomenon. It\u2019s as much about political correctness and the cultural turmoil caused by mass immigration as it is about the distribution of resources. I suspect one reason Mr. Judis concentrates so exclusively on economic issues is that it allows him to categorize       Bernie Sanders\u2019s       2016 insurgency as \u201cpopulist.\u201d But for the most part Mr. Sanders\u2019s band of earnest hipsters and college professors don\u2019t think of themselves as populists\u2014common folk\u2014but as the nation\u2019s rightful, if yet unacknowledged, elite. They are, in other words, Anywheres.In both these slim volumes, however, you sense a spirit of fairness and a capacity for self-criticism\u2014and that, surely, is what their liberal Anywhere readers need so badly.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 15:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/barton-swaim-on-political-books-1499454481", "news_title": "Barton Swaim on Political Books", "keywords": "bookcar0708,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,reviews"}, {"content": "For everyone who loves disaster movies, and the sound of Wile E. Coyote going splat, here\u2019s a book about Planet Earth\u2019s multiple suicide attempts\u2014sorry, mass-extinction events. The Earth \u201chas nearly died five times over the past 500 million years,\u201d notes science writer       Peter Brannen       in \u201cThe Ends of the World.\u201d One of these events, the End-Permian Extinction 252 million years ago, killed more than 95% of all living things, earning it a reputation as \u201cthe Great Dying.\u201d The other four, muddling along at a somewhat more modest rate, were nonetheless apocalyptic enough to make biblical floods and famines seem like Monday at the office.Mr. Brannen sets out to learn \u201cjust how bad\u201d it could get, with a view to understanding our own future as climate change advances across the planet. Brace yourself. It\u2019s not just about \u201ca rock larger than Mount Everest\u201d slamming into the planet at a speed \u201ctwenty times faster than a bullet.\u201dBy Peter Brannen  Ecco, 322 pages, $27.99That is of course the leading theory about what happened to Tyrannosaurus rex and friends in the best-known mass extinction, at the end of the Cretaceous Period 66 million years ago. Debate about this theory in the 1980s began in ridicule and progressed to widespread acceptance, with the fatal asteroid ultimately linked to an impact crater 110 miles wide on the coast of Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. An alternative\u2014or possibly complementary\u2014theory puts the blame on massive volcanic eruptions occurring almost simultaneously on the opposite side of the planet, in the Deccan Traps of India.As a result of the debate over what killed the dinosaurs, the study of mass extinctions, \u201clong pushed aside as a disreputable fringe of paleontology,\u201d became cutting edge, Mr. Brannen writes, and it has opened up a whole new world of potential Armageddons. Thus he gleefully introduces readers to \u201ctruly mind-blowing cyclical floods called j\u00f6kulhlaups,\u201d waves \u201c20,000 feet high,\u201d catastrophic volcanic eruptions that make Krakatoa or Vesuvius look like \u201cpathetic burps,\u201d 500-mile-per-hour winds loaded with toxic hydrogen sulfide, and vast swaths of the planet alternately buried under miles of ice, baked at 140 degrees Fahrenheit or drowned by oceans like hot soup.The evidence of past extinctions turns out to be surprisingly visible all around us in North America. \u201cWe live on a palimpsest of earth history,\u201d Mr. Brannen writes. Look west from Manhattan, for instance, and the high cliffs of the Hudson River Palisades are a vestige of the End-Triassic mass extinction 200 million years ago. They were formerly \u201cgigantic underground channels\u201d spewing an \u201cincandescent fountain\u201d of lava, much of which landed a little to the west, forming New Jersey\u2019s Watchung Mountains.West Texas, an arid region best known for its Permian Basin gas and oil fields, is similarly the perfect destination for End-Permian tourism. The Guadalupe Mountains there are a former barrier reef, a \u201cmarine tableau, frozen in limestone,\u201d made up of what were once vase sponges, horn corals, crinoids and other ancient sea creatures, the last profusion of species before the Great Dying. \u201cLife on earth,\u201d Mr. Brannen reminds us, \u201cconstitutes a remarkably thin glaze of interesting chemistry on an otherwise unremarkable, cooling ball of stone.\u201dMr. Brannen\u2019s travels introduce us to the paleontologists who work these landscapes, often by studying the fossil remains of uncharismatic invertebrates. The paleontologists tend to \u201cregard the dinosaur folks,\u201d one of them admits, in the same slightly patronizing way that \u201cmarine biologists look at people who work with dolphins.\u201d These visits are occasionally illuminating. We learn, for instance, that the continents did not always have our familiar north-south orientation. In the Ordovician Period roughly 450 million years ago, North America, Siberia, Australia and other continents drifted in isolation along the equator. So while many species in our time have already begun to extend their ranges north or south toward the poles, in response to the warming climate, their Ordovician counterparts \u201cfound themselves marooned on their island continents, separated from habitable refuges by vast open oceans.\u201dUnfortunately, Mr. Brannen\u2019s travels often distract more than they inform. He spends much of the book bouncing down a dirt road to the site of some past geological catastrophe or other. But he seldom sticks around long enough to see much or to help readers understand what was happening, or why, in any given period. He works desperately to avoid being dragged down by humdrum details. \u201cWhen a geologist calls something boring, reel in horror,\u201d he advises. But his alternative is to reach for snappy-sounding descriptions\u2014the ancient armored fish Bothriolepis and Dunkleosteus resemble \u201cbony Frisbees\u201d and \u201cpsychotic torpedo Cuisinarts,\u201d respectively\u2014that just leave the reader mystified.Mr. Brannen is also obsessed with the apocalyptic tendencies of the present day. This is understandable, given our deadly mix of greenhouse-gas pollution, ocean acidification and species extinction. But past extinctions are complicated enough on their own. Competing theories about these ancient extinction events abound, and readers need an evenhanded guide to weed out the wild speculation from ideas more firmly grounded in evidence. Instead, Mr. Brannen repeatedly flashes forward, pausing, for instance, during a description of a catastrophe that happened 252 million years ago to interject: \u201cNo one knows where our modern experiment with the planet\u2019s geochemistry will lead.\u201dIf you want to understand past extinction events, you would do better to try paleontologist       Norman MacLeod\u2019s       2013 book \u201cThe Great Extinctions.\u201d For the current world-wide disappearance of species, try       Elizabeth Kolbert\u2019s       \u201cThe Sixth Extinction\u201d (2014).The one hopeful aspect of our own developing catastrophe is that humans are the driving cause this time, unlike in previous extinction events. That means humans could still develop a remedy. Mr. Brannen points out that we have successfully acted in the past to address human threats to the planet\u2019s atmosphere. In the 1980s, for instance, NASA simulations of continued use of chlorofluorocarbons showed the ozone layer almost completely disappearing by 2060 and spawning what he calls \u201ca global wave of lethal mutations and cancers.\u201d Instead, 197 nations came together to ratify the 1989 Montreal Protocol, which set the ozone layer on a course to recovery by the middle of this century. In the U.S., the 1989 amendments to the Clean Air Act likewise quickly reduced the threat of acid rain and led to dramatic improvements in the quality of the air we breathe. Both of those initiatives began under Republican administrations, and the current administration could still take that kind of bold, forward-looking action on climate change. The lesson from the unimaginable devastation of past extinction events is that we have everything to lose by continued delay.\u2014Mr. Conniff is the author, most recently, of \u201cHouse of Lost Worlds: Dinosaurs, Dynasties, and the Story of Life on Earth.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-07 15:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/earths-mass-extinctions-1499454390", "news_title": "Earth\u2019s Mass Extinctions", "keywords": "bookcar0708,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,natural environment,global,world issues,reviews"}, {"content": "Not long ago the Times Literary Supplement decided to advertise its review of a clutch of       Jane Austen      -related material with an unusually striking cover image. Poised intently on the gray stone terrace of some stately home stood three immensely beautiful young women. Each came nattily dressed in the fashions of the early 19th century; one, at least, was wearing a bonnet. There, however, the connection to Regency-era decorum ended, for each, mysteriously, wore an expression best described as \u201cfeisty,\u201d had her stony eyes trained on an unseen assailant, and was brandishing a drawn sword. These, it turned out, were three of the Bennet sisters, played by the actresses       Bella Heathcote,       Lily James       and       Millie Brady,        in the 2016 feature film \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies.\u201dWhile the average Austen enthusiast\u2014a \u201cJaneite,\u201d to use the technical term\u2014will straightaway mark this down as a travesty of everything he or she holds dear, it should be pointed out that bygone fans were quite as bewildered by some of the liberties taken by the film publicists of the mid-20th century. Even now it can come as rather a shock to discover that the shout-line for the 1940 version of \u201cPride and Prejudice,\u201d scripted by       Aldous Huxley       and starring       Laurence Olivier       and       Greer Garson,        ran \u201cBachelors beware! Five Gorgeous Beauties are on a Madcap Manhunt.\u201d Purists, naturally, were outraged, and yet the unifying theme of each of four new books on Austen and her reputation is an insistence that the visions of Bath and Pemberley peddled by die-hard Janeites are often quite as false to the original texts as any member of the undead disturbing Mr. Darcy in his dressing room.By Paula Byrne  Harper Perennial, 334 pages, $16.99By Lucy Worsley  St. Martin\u2019s, 387 pages, $29.99By Helena Kelly  Knopf, 318 pages, $27.95By Devoney Looser  Johns Hopkins, 291 pages, $29.95If Austen\u2019s status as an English classic currently rests somewhere between       Shakespeare       and Dickens, then she is also\u2014here on the 200th anniversary of her passing in July 1817\u2014a handy illustration of the ancient truism that what happens to writers after their deaths is nearly always quite as fascinating as the life itself. Eighty years ago, for example, Dickens, that champion liberal and free spirit, was being hailed by left-wing writers as \u201calmost\u201d a Marxist and by religious apologists as \u201calmost\u201d a Catholic. In much the same way, two-thirds of a century after its author\u2019s miserable death, a browser of the newspaper op-ed pages could be forgiven for assuming that       George Orwell\u2019s       \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d (1949) was expressly written to satirize the       Trump       presidency. It is the same with Jane. Is she a romantic, a satirist or even a proto-feminist? What do her women want? And\u2014perhaps even more important\u2014what do we want from them?Efforts to fit long-dead writers into the behavioral straitjackets of the present may very often involve huge amounts of special pleading or grotesque misrepresentations of historical fact, but the impetus behind them is perfectly understandable. It is a mark of how much the 21st century values such literary colossi as Orwell, Dickens and Shakespeare that it should want to use them as spiritual litmus paper: If they weren\u2019t so important to us, we would leave them behind and find other lanterns to guide us through the contemporary murk. Even more significant, perhaps, is that we should almost invariably find in them things that sometimes aren\u2019t there, magnify some of their authors\u2019 preoccupations and diminish others to the point of marginality. And so, reaching the end of \u201cThe Genius of Jane Austen: Her Love of Theatre and Why She Works in Hollywood,\u201d and reflecting on Austen\u2019s endless transitions to the wide screen,       Paula Byrne       can only conclude that, had she lived, Jane would have been \u201cbaffled\u201d that most of the film adaptations emphasize the romantic aspects of her fiction when her real intention was \u201cto subvert and undermine the romantic.\u201dThere is a great deal in all these books about subversion and undermining, so much so that it occasionally can make Miss Austen, scribbling surreptitiously away in the drawing room while family life ebbed and flowed around her, look like the wiliest of postmodern cryptographers rather than a youngish woman of the reign of       George III      \u2014she was born in 1775\u2014filing amused reports on the somewhat restricted middle-class world in which she flourished. At the same time, the temptation to over-read her\u2014to zealously re-examine the positions she may, or may not, be supposed to have taken up\u2014is exacerbated by how little we know about her, an absence of hard fact that, as all four of her latest interpreters acknowledge, encourages mythmaking.We associate Austen with the West Country town of Bath, with hearths and homes and domestic solidity, but as TV history presenter       Lucy Worsley       points out in her new biography, \u201cJane Austen at Home,\u201d much of her life was spent in transit, living out of suitcases. Nearly all her heroines are, in some sense, displaced persons, in search of comfort and security.As for that absence of hard fact, we might think that we can approach Austen through her letters, but they, it tends to be argued, are less revealing than they seem: Many of the original texts are missing; those that remain are sometimes more a smokescreen than an illumination. The novels,       Helena Kelly       assures us in \u201cJane Austen, the Secret Radical,\u201d are \u201cas close to Jane as we\u2019re ever going to get.\u201dBut how close is that, given the obfuscations and seductive reimaginings of the novels by the cineastes? Nearly everyone here is convinced that the damage was done by       Andrew Davies\u2019s       highly praised 1995 BBC adaptation of \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d starring       Colin Firth       and       Jennifer Ehle,        which, Ms. Kelly insists, faithlessly manipulates and sanitizes its source. Mr. Darcy\u2019s comparatively modest estate at Pemberley is upgraded to the Duke of Devonshire\u2019s Chatsworth pile. Mr. Bennet\u2019s affability and eccentricity trump his incompetence, ineffectuality and neglect of his family\u2019s interests. And so, incriminatingly, on, with romance replacing social tension and chatter filling in for the political hint.\u201cThe Secret Radical\u201d is a provocative, if impressionistic, study, which alternates fictionalized episodes from Austen\u2019s life (\u201cSunlight and shadow chase each other across the sea ramparts, while the waves dance, mischievous, sparkling, to welcome in the yearly miracle of an English spring,\u201d runs one picturesque lead-in) with some convincing arguments about Austen\u2019s interest in, or at least awareness of, the radical underpinnings of the Georgian age. \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d is reimagined as a dispatch from a country at war with its cross-Channel neighbor and \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d redefined as a book about greed and need and \u201cthe terrible, selfish things that families do to each other for the sake of money.\u201d These are novels, in Ms. Kelly\u2019s reading, about locked cabinets, jealously guarded mysteries and emotional concealments. Hunky Mr. Darcy plunging into his lake then running into Elizabeth Bennet (a scene that Austen never got round to writing) is given the shortest of shrifts.As the example of Colin Firth in his figure-hugging swimwear reminds us, much of Austen\u2019s periodic reinvention has to do with the pictorial representation of her characters. One of the most fascinating sections of Devoney Looser\u2019s \u201cThe Making of Jane Austen,\u201d a study of Austen\u2019s near-continuous post-death reinvention, consequently takes in the wildly different approaches of her early illustrators. The first collected editions of her novels in the 1830s brought her sartorially up to date by putting her heroines in early-Victorian clothing and playing up the familial, female and sensational elements, only to be replaced, come the 1870s, by a hankering for the Wordsworthian sublime that tied them to nature and geographical place. Then came the artist       Hugh Thomson       (1860-1920), who drew attention to the social criticism implicit in Austen\u2019s attitude to matchmaking and produced a famous illustration of the five Bennet sisters seated in a line of high-backed chairs and being inspected by their parents. Elizabeth is accompanied not by a drawn sword but by a sign bearing the words \u201cNot for Sale.\u201dBy the later 19th century, Ms. Looser argues, Austen was already a chameleon-like figure, simultaneously regarded as a traditionalist and as the advocate of social change, praised by conservative gentlemen in their clubs for being apolitical while the suffragists promenading outside their windows had her name woven into their banners. Half a century later, the placid comfort of her domestic interiors was balm to a readership traumatized by war, while half a century after that her gossiping sororities awaiting their suitors\u2019 calls looked like a less sophisticated version of a Hollywood teen movie.If all this suggests that, 200 years after her early death (over which, as in nearly every other aspect of her life, hangs a fog of mystery), Austen is a literary version of one of       John Wyndham\u2019s       Triffids, capable of colonizing every territory to which she is introduced, then several unifying factors remain. One of them is the intensely proprietorial air brought to her by her fans. Lucy Worsley confesses to having \u201csearched for my own Jane, and naturally I have found her to be simply a far, far better version of myself: clever, kind, funny, but also angry at the restrictions of her life.\u201d The suspicion, alas, is that \u201cmy own Jane\u201d may actually be in part someone else\u2019s, for the appearance of \u201cJane Austen at Home\u201d in the U.K. was met by accusations (which Ms. Worsley denied) that she had borrowed some of her conceptual armature from an earlier book by Paula Byrne titled \u201cThe Real Jane Austen.\u201dAnother unifying factor, curiously enough, is a descent into idiomatic chattiness. Devoney Looser may be a professor of English at Arizona State, but that doesn\u2019t stop her, in \u201cThe Making of Jane Austen,\u201d from wanting to get down with the kids by rapping about \u201cmonikers,\u201d \u201cdirect riffs\u201d and \u201cknockoffs.\u201d Ms. Worsley, too, leaps in her preamble to take issue with what she regards as misreadings of Austen\u2019s texts (\u201cWrong, wrong, wrong . . . Big mistake!\u201d etc.). But perhaps this, too, is a testimony to Jane\u2019s enduring appeal. So eager are fans of \u201cEmma\u201d and \u201cPersuasion\u201d to explain what really matters about her to an impressionable new audience that literature professors and TV presenters alike turn quaintly demotic in her presence. Like her ability to inspire zombie films in which Miss Elizabeth Bennet lays about the undead with a flailing sword, this is quite an achievement.\u2014Mr. Taylor is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe New Book of Snobs.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-07 15:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-jane-for-every-reader-1499454291", "news_title": "A Jane for Every Reader", "keywords": "bookcar0708,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014The hospital that won a legal battle in June to have a baby boy\u2019s life-support withdrawn said\u00a0Friday\u00a0it asked a U.K. court for a fresh\u00a0hearing\u00a0in light of\u00a0what it said was\u00a0new evidence about a potential treatment for him.Eleven-month-old       Charlie Gard       is on an artificial ventilator at Great Ormond Street Hospital and suffers from a rare genetic disease that affects his brain, breathing and muscles.His parents lost a legal appeal in June to take him for experimental therapy in the U.S., after the hospital argued successfully that the treatment, which hasn\u2019t been tested on mice or humans with Charlie\u2019s condition, wasn\u2019t in his best interests and wouldn\u2019t help his condition.

Similar job market. Different analysis.U.S. employers added a seasonally adjusted 1.1 million jobs during the first six months of 2017, the Labor Department said Friday. That almost exactly matched the first-half job gain in 2016, and is consistent with the yearslong trend of steady job creation pushing down the unemployment rate.Though the trends haven\u2019t changed much, the president and his advisers are describing them differently.White House Press Secretary       Sean Spicer      tweeted Friday, \u201cGreat news for US workers - 222000 jobs added in June.\u201dLabor Secretary       Alexander Acosta       noted Friday that the unemployment rate has declined by 0.4 percentage point since the president took office in January. \u201cRobust job creation and moderate wage growth has direct impact on American families,\u201d he said.President Donald Trump has embraced the low jobless numbers. On July 2, he tweeted, \u201cStock Market at all-time high, unemployment at lowest level in years.\u201dLess than a year ago, as a Republican candidate, he took a starkly different view of jobs numbers.\u201cOne in five American households do not have a single member in the labor force,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a August 2016 speech. \u201cThese are the real unemployment numbers\u2014the 5% figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.\u201dLabor-force participation now is virtually unchanged from a year ago, and the unemployment rate has edged down further to 4.4% in June, near the lowest level since 2001.When asked about the president\u2019s different tone toward job numbers since he was a candidate, a White House spokesman Friday referred to a comment Mr. Spicer made at a March press briefing.\u201cI talked to the president prior to this, and he said to quote him very clearly\u2014\u2018They may have been phony in the past, but it\u2019s very real now,\u2019 Mr. Spicer said with a smile.To be sure, it is common for presidents to point to improving employment figures to show their policies are effective. President       Barack Obama       held a news conference in February 2016 to tout the unemployment rate\u2019s fall below 5% for the first time since the recession ended. And many economists say the control any president has over hiring and the economy is typically overstated, and to the degree policies influence the data, it takes years, not months.The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a largely independent arm of the Labor Department, compiles the jobs figures. Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t yet nominated a new statistics commissioner, the only political appointee in the agency. Mr. Acosta has said maintaining the integrity of economic data is a high priority.Job growth in the first half of 2017, while only down by 2,000 from 2016, was the smallest gain to start the year since 2010. Still, that hiring maintained last year\u2019s pace runs counter to many economists\u2019 expectations for a gradual easing in the face of a smaller supply of workers.The economy added an average of 250,000 jobs a month in 2014, the best pace of job creation since 1999. That came in a year when the unemployment rate was mostly above 6%\u2014signaling an ample supply of available labor\u2014and wages were growing at just a 2% annual rate. In the years since, the pace of hiring eased and wage gains modestly improved. But any hiring slowdown has at least temporarily abated this spring. Job creation in the second quarter was stronger than the pace the prior 15 months.\u201cWe\u2019ve been forecasting a slowdown, but it hasn\u2019t materialized,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \u201cSome folks who have been out of the labor market for a long time are starting to get hired.\u201dMr. Spicer in his tweets Friday shared a headline noting a \u201cRecord Number of Americans Employed in June.\u201dThat record has been broken every month since May 2014, when the economy recovered all jobs lost during the recession and its aftermath.Industries where Mr. Trump promised to add jobs have seen mixed progress.

She will testify Thursday in the Senate, which doesn\u2019t appear likely to advance the bill soon.The Fed\u2019s report didn\u2019t provide new clues about the immediate policy or economic outlook. The economy has largely performed in line with Fed expectations with two exceptions: Inflation has softened in recent months after it appeared to converge earlier this year toward the central bank\u2019s 2% target, and financial conditions have eased even though the Fed has now raised interest rates three times in as many quarters.The Fed raised its benchmark federal-funds rate in June to a range between 1% and 1.25%. Officials have penciled in one more quarter-point increase this year, and they unveiled plans to begin slowly shrinking their portfolio of more than $4 trillion in Treasury and mortgage securities. The Fed said in Friday\u2019s report it expects to begin implementing the plan this year, in line with recent statements.In Friday\u2019s report, the Fed weighed in on a long-running academic debate about the use of mathematical rules to guide monetary policy. The debate has taken on added urgency because House Republican lawmakers, who have been critical of the Fed\u2019s approach to keeping rates low in recent years, have advanced legislation that would require the Fed to more closely adhere to prescriptive rules in setting policy.The House-approved legislation would require the Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee to adopt a policy rule and it would empower the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, to monitor compliance. While the Fed wouldn\u2019t have to follow the rule, it likely would invite greater political scrutiny of the bank\u2019s monetary policy decisions.Advocates say that would make monetary policy more predictable, but critics say the rules could create new complications, particularly in an environment when interest rates are near zero.\u201cThe U.S. economy is highly complex, and these rules, by their very nature, do not capture that complexity,\u201d the Fed report said.Such rules, including one offered in the early 1990s by Stanford University professor       John Taylor,        are relatively easy to use and prescribe a tight relationship between a small number of economic data points and the setting of short-term interest rates. Fed officials say they regularly use such rules to guide their management of monetary policy but have warned against overreliance.\u201cMonetary policy rules do not take account of broader risk considerations,\u201d such as risks to financial stability, the report said. In addition, rules don\u2019t provide enough flexibility for asymmetric risks, for example, limiting possible responses to an economic shock when the federal-funds rate is close to zero.\u201cThis asymmetric risk has in recent years provided a sound rationale for following a more gradual path of rate increases than that prescribed by policy rules,\u201d the report said.The report also flagged significant differences between policy rules. \u201cThe pace of tightening that the rules prescribe has varied widely,\u201d the report said, with different rules proposing a federal-funds rate during the first quarter of anywhere from 0.37% to 2.5%.Separately, the report said vulnerabilities facing the U.S. financial system remain moderate, with demand for higher risk from investors offset by strong capital positions for the financial sector as a whole.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 14:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-report-cautions-on-hazards-of-monetary-policy-rules-1499440493", "news_title": "Fed Report Cautions on Hazards of Monetary Policy Rules", "keywords": "fed,federal reserve report,fed monetary policy report,fed mpr,fed report,fomc,monetary policy report,mpr,yellen,yellen congress,yellen testimony,Federal Reserve,John Taylor,Janet Yellen,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Journalists will debate who \u201cwon\u201d the first face-to-face meeting between President       Donald Trump       and Russian strongman       Vladimir Putin       on Friday in Hamburg. But by important measures Mr. Putin was already losing before either man even arrived in Germany.As for what happened once they got together, it may take some time to figure out who benefits most from a new cease-fire agreement for Syria. But don\u2019t tell the             New York Times.       The paper was ready to declare a victor in a headline even before the historic meeting: \u201cFor Russia, Trump-Putin Meeting Is a Sure Winner.\u201d According to the Times:If Mr. Trump was sure to lose, it would be especially humiliating. That\u2019s because, according to an \u201ceditor on gender issues\u201d at the Times, this was not merely a competition between nations:While some journalists may focus on images of Mr. Putin on horseback, it\u2019s useful to remember that he presides over an economy that is less than one tenth the size of ours. Precisely because it is run by Vladimir Putin, Russia is a chronic economic underachiever despite its highly educated population. Mr. Putin\u2019s KGB training under the old communist regime may be useful in weakening other countries but it doesn\u2019t enrich his own. Like a number of backward regimes that don\u2019t respect the rule of law and therefore have trouble encouraging entrepreneurial creativity, Russia is heavily reliant on oil as its principal export. And lately Mr. Putin and his cronies have been losing their shirts.After a multi-year recession due to economic sanctions and declining oil prices, Russian officials have been hoping to eke out slow growth in 2017. Russian stocks rebounded last year as traders bet on an oil rebound. But lately investors have been less enthusiastic.It might seem ironic given the non-stop accusations of collusion between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia aired in the American media, but the first months of the Trump Administration have coincided with a notable decline in the value of Russian assets.While equities in most of the world have been rallying, \u201cjust four prominent stock-market indexes fell through the first six months of the year,\u201d notes the Journal\u2019s Steven Russolillo. And which market has been the biggest loser? \u201cRussia\u2019s RTS Index sank 13% in the first half, the worst performer of the 30 indexes tracked by The Wall Street Journal,\u201d he adds.Perhaps it\u2019s not entirely a coincidence. Call it the geopolitical equivalent of trolling or call it wisely exploiting American energy resources. But on the same day that Mr. Trump was in Poland warning Russia against interventions in other countries, Mr. Trump\u2019s interior secretary was back home creating opportunities for new energy supply\u2014and at the margin adding downward pressure to the prices of Mr. Putin\u2019s key exports. The Washington Post reports:More U.S. energy production continues to deliver more bad news to Moscow. China, a longtime customer of Russia, is now buying large volumes from the United States, which now challenges Russia and Saudi Arabia for world leadership in oil production. The Journal reports:However Mr. Putin performs in Hamburg, he\u2019ll still have to go back home to the economic mess he created.

Va.\u2014not far from his hometown of Ona, near the borders of Ohio and Kentucky.The organization was based on \u201ca fairly simple idea,\u201d Mr. Dennison says: to hire unemployed people to work for a licensed general contractor startup that would build affordable, energy-efficient housing in the area. Over the years, the organization has branched out into other fields, and laid-off coal miners receive priority in the hiring queue. Trainees have to commit to complete 33 hours of paid work, six hours of community-college classes and three hours of life-skills classes every week\u2014toward the goal of earning an associate degree and professional certification in such fields as solar installation and asbestos removal at the end of two years.In a state that consistently ranks among America\u2019s lowest in rates of higher education, encouraging more of his fellow West Virginians to attend community college was particularly important to Mr. Dennison. For those who have signed onto the program, \u201cmost are the first in their families to go to college,\u201d he says.Since 2012, 23 people have completed the Coalfield Development Corp. program; all have associate degrees and now work full-time. Today, 55 trainees are on the group\u2019s payroll, and their achievements help to motivate others. \u201cPeople see unemployed coal miners back to work, driving tractors, installing solar panels,\u201d Mr. Dennison says.Trainees can now work in five different enterprises in five different counties in southern West Virginia, as well as in a coffee shop, the first in downtown Wayne, in a building renovated by a Coalfield Development Corp. team. Some are working in agriculture and solar power (a field in which the corporation\u2019s trainees are the only local licensed installers, Mr. Dennison says). Others are learning to do woodwork and to build furniture. Trainees are also reclaiming former strip-mining sites for farming, planting blueberry and blackberry bushes as well as herbs such as lavender and thyme. \u201cWe are a very future-oriented group,\u201d Mr. Dennison says.The Coalfield Development Corp. is supported by government and foundation grants, private donors and its own sales and contracts. The organization aims eventually to spin off its ventures as for-profit enterprises.Mr. Dennison, 31, is the son of two university professors. Growing up, he saw that government programs were a crucial safety net for many in the region. But the programs \u201cdidn\u2019t create transformative opportunities in people\u2019s lives,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to build something sustainable.\u201dIn the coming years, Mr. Dennison says, possible new enterprises for the organization could include work in areas such as transport and logistics, health care, technology and software\u2014industries that many don\u2019t typically associate with Appalachia. \u201cWe are a part of the country and have a lot to offer,\u201d he says.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 13:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/job-renewal-in-appalachia-1499449363", "news_title": "Job Renewal in Appalachia ", "keywords": "appalachia,brandon dennison,coalfield development corporation,unemployement, west virginia,political,general news,education,university,college,building construction,residential building construction,construction,real estate"}, {"content": "When the story of             Tesla        TSLA -0.91%       is finally written, this week will be seen as a crucial juncture. On Friday, the electric car company started production on its highly anticipated Model 3, one day after its stock briefly fell into a bear market.The week\u2019s 13% share-price decline as of Friday morning brings the company\u2019s financial position into fresh focus given its historic reliance on the equity market. At first glance, the company has plenty of cash on hand\u2014more than $4 billion as of March 31. But that is likely to go quickly.Tesla\u2019s free cash outflow was $622 million in the first quarter. Since Tesla delivered fewer cars in the second quarter than in the first, there is a decent chance that number will worsen. Tesla said Friday that about 3,500 cars were in transit to customers at the end of June, the lowest tally in five quarters.Accounts payable have risen to nearly $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, Tesla has $7 billion in long-term\u00a0debt outstanding.The Model 3 isn\u2019t likely to improve matters, at least in the short term. Tesla said in the first quarter that it expected an additional $1.5 billion on capital spending before the Model 3 began production.Analysts at Guggenheim Securities, which have a $430 price target on the stock, about 37% above its current level, predict that gross margins on the Model 3 will be negative 15% at the start of the launch. Gross margin won\u2019t turn positive until the middle of next year, according to their estimates. Tesla reported an automotive gross margin of 27.4% in the first quarter.Tesla could forgo some of its planned capital spending if it chose to do so. But that would slow the Model 3 rollout amid increasing competition, which could hammer the stock.The good news is that Chief executive       Elon Musk       should have other options.Tesla historically has had no difficulty accessing the capital markets. The company has issued equity or convertible debt in every year since its 2010 initial public offering, most recently in March. And despite a bad week, the shares are up more than 40% so far this year.Yet Tesla needs to raise several billion dollars to meet its goals. Assuming a $1 billion cash balance and four quarters of similarly negative cash flow, Tesla would need to raise nearly $3 billion over the next year. At current prices, that amounts to roughly 6% of the total equity value. The more the shares slip, the greater the potential dilution of existing owners.Chinese technology company         Tencent\u2019srecent investment in Tesla stock is an encouraging sign that there is appetite for large chunks of equity. While that deal didn\u2019t involve fresh cash, it suggests other potential options besides a traditional secondary market issuance.So the past would suggest that the recent selloff won\u2019t be much of a long-term problem for Tesla shareholders. Yet Tesla\u2019s balance sheet and the increasingly crowded electric-car field suggest this is a moment the company can\u2019t risk squandering.Write to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 13:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-skid-is-coming-at-the-worst-time-1499446957", "news_title": "Tesla\u2019s Skid Is Coming at the Worst Time   ", "keywords": "captial markets,heard on the street,stock price,tesla share price,tsla,Tesla,TSLA,Tencent Holdings,HK:0700,financial performance,share price movement,disruptions,corporate,industrial news,commodity,financial market news,motor vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive"}, {"content": "NPD BookScan gathers point-of-sale book data from more than 16,000 locations across the U.S., representing about 85% of the nation\u2019s book sales.

Is this part of human nature, and is it the best way to achieve happiness? \u2014AnnieMost of us believe that more money brings more happiness\u2014and the wealthy are no exception. In a 2014 survey of very wealthy clients at a large investment bank, Mike Norton of Harvard Business School asked clients how happy they were and how much money would make them really happy.Regardless of the amount they already had, they responded that they\u2019d need about three times more to feel happy. So people with $2 million thought they could achieve happiness if they had $6 million, while those with $6 million saw happiness in having $18 million, and so on. This kind of thinking changes, of course, as people get more money, with happiness in reach at a level that is some multiple more than what they already have.Although people predict that money strongly influences happiness, researchers also find that the actual relationship between wealth and happiness is more nuanced. In 2010 Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton analyzed data from over 450,000 responses to a daily survey of 1,000 U.S. residents by the Gallup Organization. They found that money does influence happiness at low to moderate levels of income. Real lack of money leads to more worry and sadness, higher levels of stress, less positive affect (happiness, enjoyment, and reports of smiling and laughter) and less favorable evaluations of one\u2019s own life. Yet most of these effects only hold for people who earn $75,000 a year or less. Above about $75,000, higher income is not the simple ticket to happiness that we think it is.Together, these studies show that we need far less money than we think to maximize our emotional well-being and minimize stress. This means that accumulating wealth isn\u2019t about the pursuit of happiness\u2014it\u2019s about the pursuit of what we think (wrongly) will make us happy.Hi Dan,When I voted this morning in the U.K. general election (at a polling station in a church) I realized that the choice of venue may impact electoral decisions. Most polling stations in my area are in either a community center or a church, which may have mental associations for voters (for example, church=conservative/right; community center=community/social responsibility/left). I was wondering if you have ever looked at this phenomenon. \u2014ZaurYour intuition is absolutely right. In a 2008 paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Jonah Berger of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and colleagues showed that Arizona voters assigned to vote in schools were more likely to support an education funding initiative. In a follow-up lab experiment, Mr. Berger also showed that even viewing images of schools makes people more supportive of tax increase to fund public schools.In other words, the context for voting certainly changes how we look at the world and what decisions we make.Dear Dan,People I meet sometimes ask me for my email address. On one hand, I want to keep in touch with those who are truly interested in friendship, but on the other, I don\u2019t want to have a million meaningless exchanges. How can I get email only from people who are truly invested in real discussions? \u2014RonThe problem is that email is too easy to send\u2014it just takes a few seconds\u2014while the person getting it on the other side might have to spend a lot of time responding to a particular message or to their email in general. My answer? Get a complex email address that takes some time to type. With this added effort you will get emails only from the people who are really interested in contacting you.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 13:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-money-buy-happiness-1499447773", "news_title": "Can Money Buy Happiness?", "keywords": " ariely,email, happiness, money, voting,wealth,political,general news,advice"}, {"content": "MANY TRAVELERS pass through Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s frenetic capital, en route to an East African safari, rarely staying longer than a night at an airport hotel. Yet this city of more than 3.5 million, which has ripened beyond its colonial roots into a multicultural capital and regional business hub, merits more attention. You\u2019ll find a hopping (and often traffic-choked) downtown, an energetic art scene, lush parks and delicious Kenyan and Southeast Asian fare, not to mention some startling wildlife reserves within the city limits. It isn\u2019t every day you can see a herd of giraffes grazing in sight of a high-rise. Here, four distinct local excursions worthy of a longer stopover.Though founded in 1899, Nairobi is still far less populated than other African capitals like Cairo and Lagos. But hefty investment and the city\u2019s recent rapid growth\u2014it added a million residents between 2000 and 2009\u2014fueled a construction frenzy. Go to the top of the 28th-floor Kenyatta Conference Center (pictured at center) to take in the skyline, which now includes two of the continent\u2019s five tallest buildings. Then learn about the city\u2019s past at the nearby Kenya National Archives, home to thousands of works of art, photos, books and preindustrial artifacts from East African tribes. kicc.co.ke, archives.gov.keGiraffe Manor, a boutique hotel within in forested parkland, is known for its unusual creature comforts: a herd of giraffes that share the property and often stick their head in windows to the guests\u2019 delight. But the hotel, one of the city\u2019s worst-kept secrets, has just 10 rooms, which are usually booked well in advance. Fortunately, it\u2019s much easier to visit the Nairobi Giraffe Center, located on the same grounds as the hotel. For just $10, you can feed the long-necked lovelies pellets and even \u201ckiss\u201d one by holding a pellet lightly in your lips and letting the giraffe grab it with its long black tongue (warning: slobbering is involved). The center, a nonprofit founded in 1983, protects and rehabilitates the Rothschild subspecies of giraffes, among the most endangered, distinguished by their all-white legs. giraffecenter.orgNairobi National Park is the only major nature reserve smack in the middle of an African capital. On its western border sits the nonprofit David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, an elephant nursery and conservation center, where, unlike inside the park proper, visitors can get up close to orphan calves. Visitors are welcome each morning to view baby pachyderms, but those who sign up to be foster parents (which simply means paying $50 a year) can return in the evening, when the facility isn\u2019t open to the public, to watch the animals race and trumpet their way home, then bed down for the night. The elephant caretakers might even let you pet a trunk or two. As well as helping to rehabilitate the animals, the Trust, which is also home to a blind rhino, helps fund efforts to stem the mass poaching of elephants and rhinos in Kenya\u2019s Tsavo National Park. sheldrickwildlifetrust.orgYou can tour the Fairview Coffee Estate, a 25-minute drive outside the city, by foot on a two-hour guided walk or rent a bike on the property and wheel yourself around the pristine gardens, waterfall and gently sloping dirt roads. Or do both. The guided tour shows you how the estate\u2019s beans (which are sold to             Starbucks,       among other coffee retailers) go from berry to brew, and enlightens you about the farm\u2019s assorted experiments to cultivate new beans that can thrive despite climate change.

A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Havas didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The probe brings scrutiny to a key member of the new government, tasked with remaking the country\u2019s decades-old labor regulations. Mr. Macron\u2019s drive to overhaul France\u2019s labor market is also his main bargaining chip in persuading Germany to shore up fissures in the European Union\u2019s common currency, such as helping weaker eurozone countries in tough economic times.Last week, Ms. P\u00e9nicaud said she would revise more than 3,000 pages of labor rules. The new proposals include capping fines for unfair dismissals and giving companies more leeway to work around rules set by unions. The success or failure of those efforts could shape the future of the European Union and its shared currency, the euro.The probe into possible favoritism could weaken Ms. P\u00e9nicaud\u2019s position.If prosecutors pressed preliminary charges against Ms. P\u00e9nicaud, \u201cshe would need to leave the government,\u201d said government spokesman Christophe Castaner speaking on the radio this week.Mr. Macron, who attended the event as France\u2019s economy minister, isn\u2019t targeted by the probe, according to a person familiar with the matter.Last month, justice minister       Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou,        defense minister Sylvie Goulard and European affairs minister Marielle de Sarnez left the government after French prosecutors launched a preliminary probe targeting their political party. The three former ministers belong to the centrist party Mouvement D\u00e9mocrate, known as MoDem, suspected by prosecutors of wrongfully using European funds to employ people working for the party as parliamentary assistants.MoDem has denied any wrongdoing.\u2014William Horobin contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 13:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-prosecutors-probe-las-vegas-event-that-new-labor-minister-helped-organize-1499447249", "news_title": "French Prosecutors Probe Las Vegas Event That New Labor Minister Helped Organize   ", "keywords": "business france las vegas party,french government,french labor laws,french labor minister,Havas,HAV.FR,Business France,Muriel P\u00e9nicaud,conferences,exhibitions,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,political appointments,terminations,politics,international relations,domestic politics,advertising,marketing,public relations,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission allowed a greater number of companies to exclude shareholder proposals during the 2017 annual meeting season, according to a report by law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP.The increased approval rate comes as the SEC is under pressure from business groups and lawmakers to revise its shareholder proposal rules, amid claims compliance is expensive and immaterial.Companies submitted 288 \u201cno-action\u201d requests to the SEC this year, and staff granted 78% of these requests for exclusions. This compares with 245 company requests in 2016, of which 68% were approved by the SEC. Such a request asks the SEC\u2019s permission to omit a shareholder proposal from a proxy vote without incurring enforcement action from the regulator.The ameliorative stance appears to be in contrast to SEC crackdowns on proxy proposal in recent years. In 2016, the SEC cracked down on companies that used vague descriptions of shareholder proposals on proxy cards to obscure their purpose. The regulator also roiled corporate interests in 2015 when it temporarily halted companies from omitting certain shareholder proposals.About a third of the proposals challenged this year were allowed to be excluded by SEC staff based on company arguments that the proposals have been substantially implemented, said Elizabeth Ising, a partner at Gibson Dunn and co-chair of the firm\u2019s securities regulation and corporate governance practice.\u201cA company\u2019s ability to exclude a shareholder proposal, in part, is dictated by what action the company has taken or is willing to take in response,\u201d Ms. Ising said.The SEC declined to comment.Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,       for example, successfully argued that it should exclude a shareholder proposal calling for reform of the company\u2019s corporate governance guidelines. The proposal asked Wal-Mart to add rules for discontinuing and removing disqualified members of the board of directors.The retailer argued that Wal-Mart shareholders have an annual opportunity to remove the directors via the annual director elections, and therefore Wal-Mart could exclude the proposal. And the SEC agreed.\u201cWe only request no action relief from the SEC to exclude a shareholder proposal if we believe it does not satisfy SEC guidelines,\u201d said a Wal-Mart spokesman. \u201cWe also seek to engage with many shareholder proponents to understand their concerns, and on a number of occasions these discussions have resulted in proposals being withdrawn.\u201dAnother successful argument presented by many companies was that the proposal tackles matters relating to the company\u2019s ordinary business operations.Merck                   & Co. used this avenue to win the SEC\u2019s approval to exclude a shareholder proposal that asked the pharmaceutical company to disclose the criteria used for price increases on its top 10 drugs.Merck argued that the proposal concerned fundamental management tasks that aren\u2019t practical for direct shareholder oversight and matters too complex for shareholders, as a group, to make an informed judgment.\u201cAfter carefully reviewing the shareholder proposal submitted by ICCR, the company submitted a request to SEC for a no enforcement action,\u201d a Merck spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe SEC granted our request.\u201dStill, the vast majority of shareholder proposals went ahead without the regulator\u2019s involvement. In all, shareholders of Russell 3000 companies submitted 827 proposals during the 2017 annual general meetings. That is down from 916 proposals put up for the 2016 proxy season and 943 proposals in 2015.Companies are unlikely to bring a proposal to the SEC if the regulator has previously declined to exclude a similar proposal, Ms. Ising said.Write to Tatyana Shumsky at tatyana.shumsky@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 13:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-lets-more-companies-ignore-shareholder-proposals-in-2017-1499447145", "news_title": "SEC Lets More Companies Ignore Shareholder Proposals in 2017 ", "keywords": " dunn & crutcher,elizabeth ising,gibson,sec,securities and exchange commission,shareholder proposals,Gibson Dunn & Crutcher,Securities and Exchange Commission,regulation,government policy,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,legal services,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "THE PEAK of Stromboli lurked behind my hotel, black smoke seeping from its top, making me more fearful as the hours passed. The total absence of vegetation on the volcano\u2019s upper half gave it a daunting and desolate feel.I had signed up to climb to the summit of the volcano that comprises most of this small, carless Italian island, strung in between Sicily and the nation\u2019s boot, and issues the black sand that covers its beaches. Stromboli is one of several active (in its case, hyperactive) volcanoes in Italy, from Sicily\u2019s Mount Etna to Mount Vesuvius near Naples, which buried Pompeii 2,000 years ago. Stromboli\u2019s volcano erupts constantly\u2014volcanologists register activity at least every hour\u2014and it has been that restless for 250,000 years. The persistence of its eruptions as well as its relatively hike-able size (it rises 3,000 feet from sea level) make it the rare active volcano that people can experience up close. Francesco Sortino, a scientist at Italy\u2019s National Institute for Geophysics and Volcanology who was working in Stromboli for the summer, told me before I set out, \u201cStromboli is a spiritual experience. Arrive at the top and you\u2019ll see.\u201dStromboli is located in the Tyrrhenian Sea, at the eastern end of the Aeolian chain of seven islands and six submerged volcanoes, many of which derive their names from Greek deities. Stromboli comes from the ancient Greek word strongule, which means a round, swelling form. A couple of the other islands have had explosions in recent centuries, but only Stromboli keeps churning out the fireworks from its summit craters. A major eruption in 2002 caused a 10-foot tsunami, and 2007 and 2014 also saw significant bursts that closed the volcano to visitors for a while. Scientists vigilantly monitor eruptions and if they get too intense, they close the trail.As the start of my excursion approached, my anxiety grew. It wasn\u2019t the possibility of being close to eruptions\u2014the gases, the lava\u2014that scared me. I worried I\u2019d lack the stamina to make it to the top and back down. Italy in high summer is hot, and hiking for five hours along a 4 \u00bd-mile loop could be exhausting. But Ingrid Bergman had done it in a dress and espadrilles in \u201cStromboli,\u201d the 1950 film Roberto Rossellini shot on the island.There are less strenuous ways to appreciate the volcano. Boat tours circle the island, offering a view of the western slope no hiker can get: a spectacle known as the Landslide of Fire, a cascade of ash and rocks falling hundreds of feet from the craters to the water. Evening tours hit this spot right at sunset to see sprays of magma in the best light.You can also appreciate plenty of the volcano underwater. Only the top third of the mountain is above sea level, and the ocean floor drops off quickly beyond the surf, giving the sea its deep blue. Boats take divers and swimmers to Strombolicchio (little Stromboli), the original center of the volcano, where magma hardened into what is now a column of rock off the coast.Since 2003, only hikers accompanied by guides have been allowed to reach Stromboli\u2019s summit. Three outfits operate near-identical excursions: They all use the same trail to get hikers up and back, and stop for a bit at the crest overlooking the craters. Most groups set out in the late afternoon to avoid the midday heat, and arrive at the summit by sunset. Hikers are advised to be in good physical shape, which seems open to interpretation.Magmatrek, the outfit I chose, instructed me to bring: a backpack and lots of water; a windbreaker, sweater and long pants for the cold weather at the top; a flashlight and snacks. I had all that ready. And yet, I couldn\u2019t get rid of the butterflies in my stomach. At 5 p.m., I checked in at Magmatrek\u2019s office on the main town square. A picture of a red stiletto was captioned simply \u201cNO\u201d in four languages. My guide, Nicola, checked my footgear\u2014I wore ankle-high boots, as the website hadsuggested\u2014before handing me a red helmet to protect against falling rocks. He had some bad news: The god of wind was not cooperating. Gusts coming in from the west were shoving clouds right into the craters. The day before, climbers hadn\u2019t been able to see much and the gasses at the top were intolerable.Our group of 20 set out single-file up a little road, past a cart selling giant peaches. Within 10 minutes, we were already on a dusty path that zigged and zagged, bordered by bamboo stalks that barred any breeze. As the sun fell behind the slope, we paused for a water break to look down at the village. The architecture could be Greek\u2014white Lego blocks of houses, accented with blue doors\u2014but it\u2019s on this side of Italy that the African plate is sliding under the European plate, causing the volcanic activity that created Stromboli. An hour in, halfway up, we reached the vegetation line beyond which the cactus, fig trees and caper bushes below couldn\u2019t survive. \u201cNow we\u2019re on the moon,\u201d Nicola told us, gesturing to the barren landscape ahead.We hit a traffic jam of trekkers: 300 people were visiting that day, Nicola told us, as many as live on the island year-round. The dust beneath our feet grew thicker and darker, and volcanic rocks, some football-sized, blocked the path, increasing the risk of tripping. Whenever the trail briefly leveled off, my feet and knees were so grateful. Out of breath, I noticed clouds skating by below us, but the top of the volcano was still shrouded.As we neared the summit, just before sunset, we put on warmer clothes and our helmets. Nicola distributed dust masks to help fend off the fumes. Little good they did: Within a few steps, several of us were coughing as we inhaled the carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide the volcano spewed.\u2018The clouds rose and we could see under them to the craters and the sea below. \u2018Look for red,\u2019 Nicola instructed.\u2019The crest overlooking the craters was dark and otherworldly. Stromboli blew black smoke and dust up into our eyes, forcing us to turn away. Nicola drew a line in the ash with his walking pole and told us not to go past it\u2014two feet away led straight down to the craters and beyond, the Landslide of Fire.Then, for a moment, the clouds rose and we could see the volcano\u2019s pit and the sea below. \u201cLook for red,\u201d Nicola instructed. Smoke erupted again, obscuring the view, but I thought I saw a glow.We departed in quiet awe after about 20 minutes\u2014longer than Nicola thought we would be able to withstand the fumes. My legs felt somewhat refreshed, but I was not prepared for the trials of the descent. The steep trail was thick with ash that reached our ankles; Nicola said to imagine we were skiing. When night fell, we strapped flashlights to our helmets. By the time we got to the vegetation line and the path cleared, my thighs were quivering.Five hours after setting out, we reached the town square and dispersed. I hobbled down a little road to the beach on my own. It was all black\u2014the sand, the water, the sky\u2014except for the white hem of the sea. I pulled off my shoes and stumbled over the rocks to wash my feet in the waves. The rocks and I had both come a long way.Getting There The only way to Stromboli is by boat. Hydrofoils make the trip from Naples (about 4 \u00bd hours, snav.it) and Sicily (1 \u00bd-hours from Messina, libertylines.it) during spring and summer. Leave your vehicle at home: There are no cars on Stromboli, only golf carts and mopeds.Staying There La Sirenetta Park Hotel offers the prime location, across the street from Ficogrande, one of the island\u2019s best beaches. Most of the rooms provide sea views, but make sure to ask for one farthest from the hotel\u2019s popular nightclub. The breakfast of freshly made pastries, fruit and yogurt, included in the room rate, is enough to fill you until dinner (from about $137 a night, lasirenetta.it).Hiking There The three main trekking companies are Magmatrek (magmatrek.it), Il Vulcano a Piedi (ilvulcanoapiedi.it) and Stromboli Adventures (stromboliadventures.it). Group hikes to the summit cost about $32; private tours are also available. Il Vulcano a Piedi also leads shorter tours to the edge of the Landslide of Fire, a three-hour hike that goes halfway up the mountain. Totem Trekking, on the main square next to the point of departure, rents hiking boots, flashlights, backpacks and other gear. Children older than 7 are technically allowed but operators don\u2019t recommend it.Eating There Hiking the volcano earns you several good meals on the island\u2014then again, hiking isn\u2019t required to sample any of them. Punta Lena is the most romantic restaurant option, with the sound of crashing waves through the open windows. Swordfish carpaccio and grilled fish pair well with white wine from one of Stromboli\u2019s neighboring islands. Spaghetti alla Strombolana, the local pasta specialty, features a sauce made of wild fennel, tomato, capers and mint and dusted with breadcrumbs (via Marina 8). Da Luciano draws big groups of friends for pizzas, pasta and more grilled fish (via Roma 15). For the hike to the summit, or a picnic at the beach, pick up some freshly made deli sandwiches and snacks at La Bottega del Marano (via Vittorio Emanuele). Cool off with a scoop of artisanal ice cream from Lapillo Gelato. Local flavors include pistachio and chocolate orange (via Roma).Appeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'A Labor of Lava Love.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 12:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feeling-brave-climb-a-hyperactive-volcano-in-italy-1499446199", "news_title": "An Italian Island Getaway with No Cars and Plenty of Sizzle", "keywords": "adventure travel,italy,stromboli,travel,volcano ,political,general news,disasters,accidents,earthquakes,volcanic activity,landslides,natural disasters,catastrophes,risk news"}, {"content": "Wall Street bankers and Silicon Valley executives thrive on networking.       Scott Stanford       has perfected the art.His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is replete with elite credentials\u2014undergraduate and business degrees from Harvard University, investment banking at             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       and a stint at a dot.com flop. But he stands out for his social network, considered vast even among the business elite.He helped       Arianna Huffington       find financing for the Huffington Post during the financial crisis, she says. Spotify AB Chief Executive       Daniel Ek       is a longtime friend, say people who know them. Barack Obama\u2019s election guru       Jim Messina       is an official business adviser.       Michelle Phan,        a co-founder of online makeup company Ipsy, counts on him for business guidance, according to someone who knows them both. And investor       Yuri Milner       credits him with introducing Mr. Milner to Silicon Valley.\u201cI will be forever grateful to him,\u201d Mr. Milner says of Mr. Stanford. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know anyone in Silicon Valley. He literally paved the way for us to become global investors.\u201dMr. Stanford\u2019s main job is running venture firm Sherpa Capital, which he co-founded four years ago with       Shervin Pishevar,        also considered one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most hyper-networked individuals.The question for Mr. Stanford is whether he can convert his connections into returns.He says he has closely interwoven his personal and professional lives as far back as he can remember. At Sherpa, he says, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to open doors for founders that they didn\u2019t know existed.\u201dA 47-year-old native of Indianapolis and videogame and science-fiction enthusiast, Mr. Stanford joined Goldman after his first matriculation at Harvard. He had transferred there from Boston College, after a dean, impressed by his coding skills, wrote a recommendation to the university, Mr. Stanford says.After leaving Goldman and getting an M.B.A. at Harvard, he joined LookSmart Ltd. as a senior executive before the online-advertising firm\u2019s 1999 IPO.Facebook Inc.       was just getting started when he returned to Goldman in 2004 after LookSmart\u2019s valuation had collapsed. He sought out entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and internationally who were building social networks, which he saw as the next big internet business.Several of Mr. Stanford\u2019s former associates at Goldman remember a one-page document he passed around outlining his \u201cgame-changing hypotheses\u201d and how prescient some were. Among them: predicting that the large number of social networks would eventually morph into three or four that people would use for different things\u2014one for business and a separate one for their personal lives.In 2009, when Facebook was looking for a sizable investment, Mr. Stanford brought Mr. Milner, a Russian entrepreneur, to Silicon Valley to meet the social network\u2019s key executives and advisers. \u201cScott and Yuri were really critical in helping us thinking about Russia and other parts of the world as being very important,\u201d says       Jim Breyer,        one of Facebook\u2019s then-board members and earliest investors.Mr. Milner invested $200 million in Facebook in 2009 and several hundred million more in 2010 and 2011 to buy out employees and early investors as part of a $1.5 billion private fundraising that Mr. Stanford helped orchestrate\u2014at the time one of the largest pre-IPO financings ever. Mr. Milner earned returns of nearly 10 times his investment with the company\u2019s 2012 IPO and became a coveted investor for other tech companies.Mr. Stanford also spearheaded Goldman\u2019s investment in Uber Technologies Inc. in 2011. The bank\u2019s $5 million investment has been valued in excess of $1 billion after the ride-hailing company\u2019s business ballooned.Mr. Stanford had seen the promise of several blockbuster companies \u201cwhen many people didn\u2019t have the visibility or transparency into where they were going,\u201d says Goldman President and Co-Chief Operating Officer       David Solomon,        who is now a Sherpa investor.In 2013, Mr. Stanford left Goldman to found Sherpa with Mr. Pishevar, who had been a managing director at Menlo Ventures.Mr. Pishevar led Menlo\u2019s investment in Uber around the same time Goldman got in. He and Mr. Stanford met shortly after that, when they were introduced to one another as the \u201cUber boys.\u201d Their firm\u2019s name comes from their idea of being \u201ctireless servants and guides\u201d to their portfolio companies, Mr. Stanford says.Investors have put roughly $640 million into Sherpa, making it one of the fastest-growing venture firms launched in the past five years, according to research firm Preqin.Sherpa in 2014 participated in fundraising rounds for Uber and Airbnb Inc., accumulating shares that have appreciated handsomely on paper. But not every bet has been a winner. Sherpa has written down some of its investments, such as used-car company Beepi Inc., which closed and for which the firm wrote off its entire $16.7 million investment. Other portfolio companies, including shipping-and-logistics company Shyp Inc. and online food-delivery service Munchery Inc., have restructured and announced job cuts.Mr. Stanford, whose office bookshelves are lined with his decades-old Wired magazine collection,\u00a0says he is fascinated by the promise of artificial-intelligence. Sherpa has poured millions into a startup called Replika, which promises a new virtual friend by using artificial intelligence to create personal chatbots that mimic a user\u2019s conversation style and personality.Replika\u2019s 30-year-old founder, a recent Russian immigrant named       Eugenia Kuyda,        says the instant friendship she struck up with Mr. Stanford was a key reason she welcomed Sherpa as an investor.\u201cWe were also new to the city, and Scott knows everyone,\u201d she says.Write to Maureen Farrell at maureen.farrell@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 12:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-harvard-to-goldman-to-the-valley-vc-scott-stanford-is-networker-extraordinaire-1499445965", "news_title": "From Harvard to Goldman to the Valley, VC Scott Stanford Is Networker Extraordinaire", "keywords": " networking, sherpa, silicon valley, social media,venture capitalist,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,Harvard University,Sherpa Capital,Scott Stanford,corporate funding,corporate,industrial news,private equity,venture funding,political,general news,living,lifestyle,social media,computers,consumer electronics,networking,banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,investment banking,alternative investments,credit,computing,financial services,investing,securities,technology,venture capital"}, {"content": "Ettore Sottsass' \u201cValentine\u201d typewriter was famously attractive\u2014and gave the designer lots of trouble. When creating it in the 1960s, Sottsass proposed leaving out the bell to signal the end of a line\u2014as well as lowercase letters\u2014to keep the machine sleek and inexpensive. The manufacturer, Italy\u2019s Olivetti, balked and Sottsass compromised. The two ended up with an irresistible scarlet typewriter that came to define Sottsass, much to his dismay.The Valentine, along with dozens of other works, goes on display at the Met Breuer, part of New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art, on July 21. The exhibition, \u201c      Ettore Sottsass      : Design Radical,\u201d will focus on the influential Italian designer, architect, painter, photographer, writer and editor who remains largely unsung outside Europe.The exhibition contains examples of Sottsass' furniture, jewelry, textiles, patterns and graphic design as well as his writing. Glass vases of swirls and squiggles in primary colors compete for attention with a red-and-yellow necklace of enameled metal and rubber. Objects can appear simple, such as a chair in shiny yellow aluminum and steel, or complex, such as a fruit dish elevated on jagged columns of silver.Sottsass, who was born in the Alpine city of Innsbruck, Austria, in 1917 and died in Milan in 2007, left a sprawling legacy marked by contradictions. Trained as an architect, he designed far more objects than houses. Both fascinated and repelled by mass production, he came up with assembly-line office equipment as well as unique ceramics and works in glass. Cherishing his independence, he resisted signing on as an in-house corporate designer. He drew inspiration from both East and West, laced his contemporary design with historical references and had a deeply serious nature at odds with his playful hallmarks such as bright colors, vivid patterns and glossy laminates.Sottsass at times doubted himself in his early years, according to \u201cEttore Sottsass and the Poetry of Things,\u201d a book by Deyan Sudjic, director of the Design Museum in London. Writing in 1980, Sottsass recalled that as a 30-year-old, \u201cSometimes I was happy, and sometimes I was desperate. Sometimes I thought I was a great talent, sometimes I thought I was a total idiot.\u201dInstead of offering a retrospective, the show puts Sottsass in the context of his creative influences. \u201cYou can\u2019t present him as a lone genius in a vacuum,\u201d said       Christian Larsen,        an associate curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mr. Larsen organized the exhibit by stages in Sottsass' work, starting with the 1950s, when he was crafting ceramics sold in art galleries and designing furniture. On display are some of the decorative ceramics that Sottsass based on ancient, simple forms such as fishing reels and spools of thread. \u201cHe is very poetic about ceramics,\u201d Mr. Larsen said. \u201cHe\u2019s really trying to find the roots of design.\u201dMr. Larsen also tracked Sottsass' \u201960s and \u201970s-era conceptual designs for living. Examples include the \u201cSuperbox,\u201d a youth-oriented modular cabinet intended to hold life\u2019s essentials for a mobile, carefree generation. The designer\u2019s \u201cTower,\u201d a 9-foot-plus piece of hybrid furniture with cabinets, drawers and adjustable shelves, dominates one room.During a stint as a design consultant for Olivetti\u2014where Sottsass was charged with transforming a room-size mainframe computer from forbidding to friendly\u2014he drew on his time in the U.S. and India. Those travels got Sottsass thinking about how mass-produced goods could benefit individuals\u2014but also lead to a sense of sameness and a culture of consumption.In the early 1980s, Sottsass and others formed the Memphis design collective. The group\u2019s name is said to have been inspired by the cities in Tennessee and ancient Egypt as well as by the song on the record player during many of the designers\u2019 conversations:       Bob Dylan\u2019s       \u201cStuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again.\u201d Working in Milan with mostly younger creators, Sottsass set out to make furnishings that could be mass produced, many with striking colors and plastic laminate skins.The ensemble\u2019s first collection of tables, lamps, clocks and other objects caused a sensation in 1981. On display at the Met Breuer is a Memphis exemplar, Sottsass' \u201cCarlton\u201d room divider, a multicolored shelf unit of wood and plastic laminate. The designer wanted such pieces to go beyond function and, thanks to their whimsical and disarming design, evoke a personal response, Mr. Larsen said. He added: \u201cIf the objects are emotional, if somehow they\u2026stimulate a memory in you, that\u2019s what they are supposed to do.\u201dSottsass' Valentine typewriter still has a following. Last year one that had belonged to       David Bowie       fetched more than $50,000 at             Sotheby\u2019s                   in London, although many are auctioned for far less. Not long before Sottsass\u2019 death, in an interview with L.A. Weekly, the 88-year-old designer lamented, \u201cI worked 60 years of my life, and it seems the only thing I did is this f\u2014ing red machine.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-07 12:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-view-contradictions-of-designer-architect-ettore-sottsass-1499445857", "news_title": "On View: Contradictions of Designer-Architect Ettore Sottsass", "keywords": " art, design radical,ettore sottsass, galleries, metropolitan museum of art, museums, new york art, valentine typewriter,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,calendar of events,routine general news,technical services,architects,surveyors,business,consumer services,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "MIAMI\u2014Commuters and tourists fed up with South Florida\u2019s clogged highways will soon have a new alternative: A posh passenger-rail service to whisk riders from Miami to Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach and, eventually, Orlando.The $3 billion system, named All Aboard Florida but better known as Brightline, is privately funded and hasn\u2019t received federal or state grant money. It comes online as President       Donald Trump       and Congress weigh a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that would rely heavily on private capital\u2014leading some to see it as a model for express intercity passenger-rail service in an age of urban revival.Brightline\u2019s owner, Florida East Coast Industries, is focused on connecting major urban centers that are from 250 to 350 miles apart with \u201chigher speed\u201d train service, at speeds up to 125 miles per hour. It plans eventually to expand Brightline service to cities further away, such as Tampa and Jacksonville.\u201cThese trips, which we see as too long to drive and too short to fly, represent the opportunity for the next generation of American train service,\u201d said Michael Reininger, executive director of Florida East Coast Industries, Brightline\u2019s parent company, at a recent congressional hearing on passenger rail.The Brightline project\u2019s niche is \u201ckind of a sweet spot of distance, for which high-speed rail can compete with driving and flying,\u201d said       Robert Poole,        director of transportation policy at the libertarian Reason Foundation.Express and high-speed rail projects are planned or under way outside Florida. A company called Texas Central is pursuing a $15 billion passenger-rail service to zip riders between Dallas and Houston in 90 minutes, with trains traveling at 200 miles an hour. The project is in the development stage with financing from private investors, said Tim Keith, the company\u2019s president.The XpressWest high-speed rail line would connect Las Vegas to Palmdale, Calif., where it could join with a Los Angeles-bound service. The proposed financing would involve private investment, local funds and federal loan programs, according to a recent letter by project backers to the Trump administration.Also in California, work is under way on the first phase of a $64 billion bullet-train line that, if completed, would link Los Angeles and San Francisco with trains speeding at more than 200 miles an hour. The project has received federal and state funding, but a private entity is expected eventually to operate it, said Dan Richard, chairman of the California High-Speed Rail Authority, at the recent congressional hearing.The projects have hit roadblocks, from court challenges to difficulty obtaining financing, all underscoring the steep challenges to creating high-speed rail lines in the U.S. Opponents question how such services will survive financially without large government subsidies.Brightline \u201cwill generate losses of more than $100 million and will be unable to service its large debt burden,\u201d wrote John Friedman, a Brown University economist, in a study funded by a citizens group opposed to the rail line.Brightline executives challenge that analysis and say their business model promises to make the venture profitable. Florida East Coast Industries, a descendant of 19th-century industrialist Henry Flagler\u2019s Florida East Coast Railway, which spurred development of the Florida coast, is relying largely on existing rail lines currently used for freight for the Brightline service. That is much cheaper than acquiring a right of way and building a passenger rail line from scratch.Dave Howard, Brightline\u2019s chief executive, said highway congestion and the hassles of air travel have strengthened demand for alternative forms of transit. The Brightline service\u2014with leather seats, Wi-Fi and bike racks\u2014will be upmarket, he said, with appeal for millennials in search of vibrant urban living. He wouldn\u2019t disclose ticket prices but said they would be comparable to the cost of driving.Highway traffic in Florida is getting worse. In the past five years, the number of daily commuters in three counties around Miami has increased by 120,000 people to 2.3 million, according to a U.S. Census survey. Most of them commute to work in cars: A local train service called Tri-Rail is a slow way to get from Miami to West Palm Beach, and there is very limited bus service.Brightline trains, traveling at a maximum of 79 miles an hour, are scheduled to begin operating between West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale later this summer, with the leg down to Miami operating in the fall, executives say. An extension up to Orlando, with trains reaching a maximum speed of 125 miles an hour, could be completed by 2019 if construction begins this year.The Brightline parent company is owned by funds managed by             Fortress Investment Group                   LLC, which is being acquired by             SoftBank Group Corp.      , of Japan. SoftBank Chief Executive       Masayoshi Son       pledged to invest $50 billion in the U.S. in a December meeting with President Trump.Florida East Coast Industries could end up raising $600 million for Brightline from tax-exempt bonds issued through a state agency\u2014an option that is approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation but doesn\u2019t require a government pledge of credit.A central element of the company\u2019s business plan is to develop the real estate around train stations it is building in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. Plans for the Miami hub, in the city\u2019s burgeoning downtown, include residential and office towers, retail shops and a food hall.The Brightline approach is similar to one pioneered in Hong Kong, where the             MTR Corp.       doubles as a mass-transit company and a real-estate enterprise that develops land around train stations, said Gabe Klein, cofounder of CityFi, which advises cities on transportation, tech and other issues. Brightline, if successful, could be \u201cthe gateway to high-quality transit\u201d in the U.S., Mr. Klein said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s being driven by the private sector.\u201dGlenn Cooper, an attorney in Fort Lauderdale at GrayRobinson, a law firm, said he would be eager to take the Brightline service several days a week to his firm\u2019s Miami office. \u201cI can be in downtown Miami in 30 minutes, and be able to work, have Wi-Fi, relax\u2014no stress, no accidents,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, it sounds like a dream.\u201dWrite to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 12:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/escape-south-florida-traffic-take-the-train-1499445618", "news_title": "Escape South Florida Traffic: Take the Train", "keywords": "all aboard florida,brightline,florida,high speed rail ,intercity rail,mass transit,transportation,Florida East Coast Industries,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,heavy construction,railway construction,freight transportation arrangement,freight transport,logistics,construction,real estate"}, {"content": "The Boston Bruins ruled the world of professional hockey six years ago when they last won the Stanley Cup. But the team\u2019s victory last week over the Internal Revenue Service will likely resonate far beyond the rink.In Jacobs v. Commissioner, the owners\u00a0of the National Hockey League\u2019s Bruins argued the team should be able to\u00a0deduct 100% of the cost of certain meals they provided\u00a0to\u00a0players and staff.\u00a0Under current law, only 50% of the cost of many business meals is tax-deductible.The Bruins\u2019 victory has potentially\u00a0opened up a new tax maneuver for many businesses. Now they may be able to write off twice as much as they thought allowable\u00a0for meals provided to large groups at business meetings far from company headquarters.\u201cThis decision goes completely for the taxpayer and opens the door to meal deductions that many people assumed weren\u2019t possible,\u201d says Eddie Adkins, national technical leader for employee benefits with accounting firm Grant Thornton.A spokesman for the IRS, which still has time to appeal the decision, had no comment. A Bruins spokesman said, \u201cWe are pleased with the decision.\"The case was brought in the U.S. Tax Court by Jeremy and Margaret Jacobs,\u00a0who own the Bruins through several entities. At issue were write-offs for business-meal expenses, long a highly contested area of tax law.Many years ago, the so-called three-martini lunch was fully deductible. But in the 1980s, Congress scaled back deductions for business-meal expenses.Today, in most cases, 50% of the cost of business meals is tax-deductible, though there are exceptions\u00a0that allow for larger deductions.For example, meals provided to employees on a business\u2019s premises can be 100% deductible by the company and not taxable to the employee if they\u2019re provided for the convenience of the employer and meet other conditions. This is an argument Silicon-Valley firms have used to preserve tax benefits for their sumptuous offerings of free food to workers.The Bruins\u2019 owners\u00a0deducted\u00a0100% of the cost of meals provided to players and staff at road games, which came to $255,754 in 2009 and $284,446 in 2010. The IRS argued the law allowed only for a 50% deduction of these expenses, and it wanted an extra $85,000 in taxes.The Tax Court judge disagreed with the IRS and sided with the Bruins. In his decision, released in late June, the judge\u00a0cited five conditions met by the team when he ruled in its favor:For hockey aficionados, the decision provides a wealth of detail about the team\u2019s practices and culture, especially on game days. For example, the team always provides the same types and quantities of food for meals \u201cto avoid players\u2019 having gastric problems during the game.\u201dAccording to \u2018Behind the B,\u2019 a television series that has documented the Bruins over the past few seasons, team meals most often include simple items such as chicken and pasta. Occasionally, there will be a special treat in certain cities, such as during the team\u2019s west coast trip last year. The team surprised the players by bringing in In-N-Out Burger in Los Angeles.The case isn\u2019t crucial financially for the Bruins. The team has a player payroll of about $70 million this year. But the\u00a0decision is a certain win for all types of professional sports teams that play away games.Tax experts say the ruling could have even broader applications.Some businesses periodically bring far-flung employees together for training or coordination. If they meet the conditions set forth in the opinion, they might also qualify for a deduction of 100% of meal expenses for all employees who attend rather than a 50% write-off, says Mr. Adkins.It isn\u2019t clear how the rules would apply to meetings at restaurants or at other types of corporate meetings. But there are a host of possibilities.Mary Hevener, an employee-benefits attorney with Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, agrees the case is a win for taxpayers but says she expects controversies over\u00a0these\u00a0meal deductions to continue.\u201cThe IRS guidance in this area is murky, and agents often apply rules based on laws that were later changed by Congress,\u201d says Ms. Hevener.A crucial issue for companies to think about as they weigh what to do is the legal definition of meals provided \u201cfor the employer\u2019s convenience.\u201d Congress has changed the law on meal deductions several times in the past few decades, but the IRS hasn\u2019t updated its regulations since 1978, she says.Tax experts say this lack of guidance makes the current meal deduction rules\u00a0as confusing as hockey\u2019s rules for icing and offsides.So until the agency issues new rules, companies\u00a0that decide to challenge the IRS over\u00a0company-provided meal expenses\u00a0could\u00a0find themselves battling it out in court.Write to Laura Saunders at laura.saunders@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 12:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-face-off-with-irs-the-boston-bruins-win-big-1499419801", "news_title": "In Face-off With IRS, the Boston Bruins Win Big", "keywords": "boston bruins tax case ,meal write-offs,tax deductions,tax law,tax policy,Boston Bruins,Internal Revenue Service,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,ice hockey,personal finance,sports,recreation,tax strategies,winter sports,advice,routine general news"}, {"content": "In need of a point guard to replace Chris Paul, who for years has been considered the top playmaker in the NBA, the Los Angeles Clippers lured an international superstar widely considered the top playmaker not in the NBA.And they paid\u2014in NBA terms\u2014almost nothing for him, highlighting a potential market inefficiency amid the league\u2019s topsy-turvy off-season.Milos Teodosic, a 30-year-old Serbian, was a EuroLeague MVP and champion, the leader of Russia\u2019s most dominant team, CSKA Moscow, and an equally deadly shooter and passer, who led the EuroLeague in both made 3-pointers and assists per game in 2017.\u201cHe\u2019s the best player in Europe,\u201d said Jonathan Givony of Draft Express, a website that scouts both American and international players. He called the 6-foot-5 Teodosic \u201ca late bloomer\u201d known for his creativity on offense.But unlike the nine-time All-Star Paul, who will make nearly $25 million in 2017-18 after being sent to the Houston Rockets, Teodosic agreed on a two-year deal, worth $12.3 million, his agent said. The pact was announced Thursday, hours before unheralded Tim Hardaway Jr. signed a four-year, $71 million offer sheet with the New York Knicks.On its surface, this discrepancy would seem like an indictment against foreign players. But that\u2019s hardly the case. There were 14 non-Americans selected in the June 22 NBA Draft, and this comes after a record 26 foreigners were picked in 2016.Teodosic\u2019s problem is that he is no longer a prospect, who can be molded into any system. Teodosic is a fully-formed player who needs to find the perfect for his playing style. Look at how the NBA values freshmen and sophomores out of college over seniors with more mileage on their legs: Teodosic is a more extreme version of that.\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna bring in a guy in his late 20s or early 30s, he\u2019s gonna have a limited shelf life in the NBA,\u201d explained former Portland Trail Blazers executive Tom Penn, who currently serves as an NBA analyst for ESPN. \u201cA coach would have to say, \u2018I like him and I\u2019m gonna play him right away.\u2019\u201dIt\u2019s possible, though, that Teodosic found that in L.A.The Clippers and coach Doc Rivers need someone to quarterback the offense like Paul, who averaged 10.6 assists per 36 minutes last year while making 41.1% of his three-point attempts. Teodosic, who averaged 8.9 assists per 36 minutes and sank 38% from deep last season, checks off those boxes as a complement to the team\u2019s star big men, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.Perhaps equally important is the presence of guard Patrick Beverley, who was acquired from Houston in the deal for Paul. Not only did Beverley play alongside Teodosic on Greece\u2019s Olympiacos in 2009-2010 (he recently told ESPN that Teodosic \u201cmight be the best passer in the NBA right now\u201d), but the All-Defensive First Team selection can act as a much-needed defensive caddy.Teodosic is \u201ca very, very poor defender,\u201d Givony said. \u201cEven in Europe, he\u2019s poor. That\u2019s gonna be a problem.\u201dBesides his defense, there\u2019s another significant issue facing Teodosic, whose game relies on frequent trips to the free-throw line.\u201cHe\u2019s going to go from a guy who gets a whistle every time they breathe on him to an NBA rookie who nobody knows and is not gonna get any calls at all,\u201d Givony said.Unlike European veteran guards who struggled in the NBA, such as Juan Carlos Navarro and Sarunas Jasikevicius, Givony sees Teodosic as similar to Jose Calderon, the playmaking journeyman who recently agreed to terms with the Cleveland Cavaliers.The Clippers hope he can be more than that. In a league where role players are commonly making eight figures per year, that could perhaps make him this off-season\u2019s biggest bargain.\u201cHe\u2019s got such a great feel for the game,\u201d Givony said. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna find guys, make shots. But how much is he giving up on the other end? That\u2019s the question.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-07 12:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-serbian-star-who-could-be-the-steal-of-the-nba-off-season-1499445298", "news_title": "The Serbian Star Who Could Be the Steal of the NBA Off-Season", "keywords": "Los Angeles Clippers,basketball,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "I know you have written about moving in later life. But what about spouses who want to retire to different places? I would like to relocate to a cooler climate, but my wife prefers someplace warmer. Needless to say, this is tricky. Any thoughts?Well\u2026this question hits uncomfortably close to home.My wife, a retired teacher, would like to move, at some point, to a small beach community, but I\u2019m reluctant to do so. (I enjoy visiting the beach, but I prefer living, as we do, near a large city. There\u2019s simply more to do.) So far, we have agreed to disagree. And I\u2019m fortunate that my wife loves our current home and neighbors. But this issue isn\u2019t going away.Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com\u201cTricky\u201d is the right word. In talking with retirees through the years, we have found that few issues are tougher to resolve than differences over where to live. Compromise is nice when it works, but the biggest risk here is dragging an unwilling spouse to a new location.One simple, but often expensive, solution is maintaining two homes and dividing your time between them. (My wife and I have talked about getting a small place at the beach. Very small.) Barring that, the best advice is to begin discussing this question often and early, ideally several years before retiring. In her book \u201cRetirement for Two,\u201d psychologist and author       Maryanne Vandervelde       offers a series of questions about moving in later life that can help spouses iron out differences. Among them:\u2022 Do we want to stay put or shake things up for retirement living?\u2022 If we decide to relocate, what factors are most important to each of us, and how would we rank them? (Examples: Climate? Cost of living? City vs. country? A bigger house? A smaller place? Proximity to family? Existing friends or new ones? Diverse-age companions or people our age?)\u2022 Can we afford, financially and emotionally, to make a mistake in where we live?\u2022 Which of us feels most strongly about where we should live?\u2022 What mechanisms\u2014such as spending an out-of-season vacation in a desired location\u2014will help us share the decision equally?\u2022 Finally, if we don\u2019t agree, how will we fashion a compromise?What percent of my retirement savings should I set aside for medical care? My wife and I are in good health. I am 71, she is 64. Is there an average amount to consider?It\u2019s tough to pinpoint a percentage for the \u201caverage\u201d retiree, simply because of the number of variables involved: a person\u2019s age at retirement, his or her life expectancy, health status, how much and what kinds of insurance a person has, etc. What we can do is look at spending patterns and projections.A good place to start is the Bureau of Labor Statistics and its comprehensive Consumer Expenditure Survey. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2016, retiree households, on average, spent $5,824 on health care. That figure includes $4,016 for health insurance, $905 for medical services, $697 for drugs and $207 for medical supplies.As for projections, Fidelity Investments each year publishes an estimate of how much money a couple retiring at age 65 will need to cover health-care costs in later life. The 2016 figure: $260,000. That doesn\u2019t include possible bills for long-term care. Fidelity estimates the same couple would need another $130,000 to insure against such costs.Finally, check out \u201cSavings Medicare Beneficiaries Need for Health Expenses,\u201d published in January by the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. Among the findings: A couple, where both spouses have median drug expenses, would need $165,000 to have a 50% chance of having enough money to cover health-care bills in retirement. Increase the odds to 90% and the figure jumps to $265,000.I have an individual retirement account with Fidelity. I have check-writing privileges for this IRA. I am over 70\u00bd. If I write a check (for less than $100,000) to a charity from this account is that considered a qualified charitable distribution? Also does the acknowledgment letter received from the charity have to mention that it is a QCD, or is merely saying \u201cthank you for your donation\u201d good enough?Yes, your check would be considered a direct transfer to the charity and, as such, would be a qualified charitable distribution.Some background: The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 made permanent a provision that allows IRA owners 70\u00bd or older to transfer as much as $100,000 a year directly from their IRA to charity. That transfer is excluded from your income and, if done correctly, counts toward the IRA owner\u2019s required minimum distribution for the year.A \u201cdirect transfer\u201d is critical. Let\u2019s say an IRA custodian makes a check payable to the account owner, who then endorses the check to the charity. That two-step process wouldn\u2019t qualify as a direct transfer.Actually, the check can be more than $100,000 if you wish, but only $100,000 would qualify as a QCD, notes       Ed Slott,        an IRA expert in Rockville Centre, N.Y. Any excess over the $100,000 would carry over as an itemized tax deduction, if you itemize. If you don\u2019t itemize, then the excess might make you eligible to itemize.As for the letter from the charity, there\u2019s no requirement to mention the QCD. But it certainly would be \u201ca nice touch, both for your tax preparer and for the charity, to make [such acknowledgments] more \u2018QCD friendly,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Slott says. \u201cMany charities are still not up on QCDs and are missing out on donations that would also be good, tax-wise, for their contributors.\u201dSo\u2026let\u2019s hope some charities are reading this.Mr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal.

The only thing that we as Americans have in common is that we like to be left alone to do what we want to do in our own backyards. The problem is that we are constantly in each other\u2019s faces because of social media, the internet and TV. We don\u2019t need to meet each other; we need to leave each other alone. Seventy years ago the domestic exchange program worked because we had one cultural bond\u2014Christianity. Now that bond is gone. The left\u2019s worship of government cannot be reconciled with the right\u2019s Christian beliefs. Our political beliefs have become our religious beliefs and vice versa.

What we face today in our politically ravaged society isn\u2019t going to be solved by a meet-and-greet. Rural folks and urbanites aren\u2019t homogeneous groups, and our divides aren\u2019t based on misunderstandings. We are teetering on the edge of a civil war.

For investors, the message is mixed.The U.S. economy added 222,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department reported Friday, and the job counts for the prior two months were revised higher. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.4% from 4.3%, but for a good reason: More people were looking for work, and therefore counted in the labor force. If there was a down note in the report, it was that wage growth is still lackluster\u2014average hourly earnings were up just 2.5% from a year earlier\u2014but at the recent hiring pace, it is hard to imagine that not improving.Taken together, the one-month number and the revisions point to a stronger jobs market than previously believed. Over the past three months, the U.S. has added about 194,000 jobs a month. The three-month average before Friday\u2019s report and the upward revisions to the April and May figures was about 121,000 jobs. The economy needs to generate fewer than 100,000 jobs to keep up with population growth. If the current trend continues, we\u2019ve gone from an employment market that was tightening only slightly to one that could change the dynamic of wage increases, inflation and bond yields. The unemployment rate could drop below 4% by early next year.Under these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will almost definitely follow through with its plans to start shrinking its balance sheet this fall and raise rates again in December. Indeed, if the recent pace of hiring holds, the Fed might set aside its worries over low inflation, and lean toward tightening faster to keep the job market from overheating.That would hurt bond investors who have bet that interest rates will hardly move in the coming months. Stocks, too, are priced for low rates. With the price/earnings ratio on the S&P 500 near its highest level in more than a decade, investors would have to rethink whether stocks deserve such high valuations.Markets largely ignored the jobs report Friday, but if stocks and bonds fall in anticipation of higher rates, that could tighten financial conditions more than the Fed would want, damaging the economy. But with jobs growth this strong, the Fed can\u2019t risk underreacting either, even with inflation well below its 2% target.As far as the Fed is concerned, the best thing would be for the job market to slow to a sustainable pace, with inflation drifting up toward its target as it gradually reduced its balance sheet and raised rates.

In particular, the bond-market turmoil of the past two weeks has jolted the market. But a decent growth outlook means investors shouldn\u2019t be too nervous about Europe.The Stoxx Europe 600 has given up roughly half of the gains it made up to early May, although it is still up 5% for the year. In local-currency terms, it is lagging behind the S&P 500, which is up around 8%, but the rise of the euro means that in dollar terms it is still well ahead.The European growth story looks solid, supporting earnings. And while the eurozone growth rate is already well above potential, relative growth does matter: Some of the drag on the headline Stoxx Europe 600 is from the U.K., where the economy seems to be suffering from Brexit uncertainty. Excluding U.K. stocks, the index is up nearly 7%.Nervousness around monetary policy is understandable. Since ultralow interest rates and abundant liquidity have boosted the valuation of many financial assets, even a very gradual shift by the European Central Bank toward the monetary-policy exit is a significant one. But it will create winners as well as losers, most notably in the financial sector, which should benefit from a steeper yield curve. European bank stocks are duly outperforming, up 10%; bond proxies like utilities have suffered.One problem for European stocks, perversely, is that a lot has gone right so far in 2017.

But health insurance isn\u2019t the only health-care problem facing us\u2014and maybe not even the most important one. No matter how the debate in Washington plays out in the weeks ahead, we will still be stuck with astronomical and ever-rising health-care costs. The U.S. now spends well over $10,000 per capita on health care each year. A recent analysis in the journal Health Affairs by the economist Sean P. Keehan and his colleagues at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projects that health spending in the U.S. will grow at a rate of 5.8% a year through 2025, far outpacing GDP growth.Our health-care system is uniquely inefficient and wasteful. The more than $3 trillion that we spend each year yields relatively poor health outcomes, compared with other developed countries that spend far less. Providing better health insurance and access can help with these problems, but real progress in containing costs and improving care will require transforming the practice of medicine itself\u2014how we diagnose and treat patients and how patients interact with medical professionals. In medical training, private sector R&D, doctor-patient relations and public policy, we need to move much more aggressively into the era of smart medicine, using high-tech tools to tailor more precise and economical care for individual patients. This transition won\u2019t be easy or fast\u2014the culture of medical practice is famously conservative, and new technology always raises new concerns\u2014but it has to be part of the solution to our health-care woes.Radical new possibilities in medical care are not some far-off fantasy. Last week in my clinic I saw a 59-year-old man with hypertension, high cholesterol and intermittent atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm disturbance). Before our visit, he had sent me a screenshot graph of over 100 blood pressure readings that he had taken in recent weeks with his smartphone-connected wristband. He had noticed some spikes in his evening blood pressure, and we had already changed the dose and timing of his medication; the spikes were now nicely controlled. Having lost 15 pounds in the past four months, he had also been pleased to see that he was having far fewer atrial fibrillation episodes\u2014which he knew from the credit-card-size electrocardiogram sensor attached to his smartphone.In my three decades as a doctor, I have never seen such an acceleration of new technology, both hardware and software, across every dimension of medical practice. I have also had the opportunity to advise and collaborate with several companies on these developments. The new tools are not just more powerful, precise and convenient; they are more economical, driven by the information revolution\u2019s ability to deliver, as Moore\u2019s Law holds, ever-increasing computing power for less money.Consider the biggest line items in the 2016 national health-care budget, according to Mr. Keehan and his colleagues: more than $1 trillion for hospital care, $670 billion for doctor and clinician services, $360 billion for drugs. And compare the often sorry outcomes: more than 1 in 4 patients harmed while in the hospital; more than 12 million serious diagnosis errors each year; a positive response rate of just 25% for patients on the top 10 prescription medications in gross sales.We don\u2019t have to resign ourselves to this outrageous situation. Smart medicine offers a way out, enabling doctors to develop a precise, high-definition understanding of each person in their care. The key tools are cheaper sensors, simpler and more routine imaging, and regular use of now widely available genetic analysis. As for using all this new data, here too a revolution is under way. Algorithms and artificial intelligence are making it possible for doctors to rapidly apply relevant medical literature to their patients\u2019 cases, while \u201cnatural language processing\u201d (that is, talking to computers) holds the promise of liberating them from keyboards during office visits.One obvious practical effect of these developments will be to replace hospital stays with remote monitoring in the patient\u2019s home. The Food and Drug Administration has already approved wearable sensors that can continuously monitor all vital signs: blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm, body temperature, breathing rate and oxygen concentration in the blood. The cost to do this for weeks would be a tiny fraction of the cost for a day in the hospital. Patients will be able to avoid serious hospital-acquired infections and get to sleep in their own beds, surrounded by family.We do more than 125 million ultrasound scans a year in the U.S., at an average charge of well over $800\u2014that\u2019s $100 billion. But we now have ultrasound probes that connect with a smartphone and provide exquisite resolution comparable to hospital lab machines. It is possible to examine any part of the body (except the brain) simply by connecting the probe to the base of a smartphone and putting a little gel on the probe\u2019s tip. When I first got a smartphone ultrasound probe last year, I did a head-to-toe \u201cmedical selfie,\u201d imaging everything from my sinuses and thyroid to my heart, lungs, liver, gallbladder, aorta and left foot.That experience came in handy when I recently developed pain in my flank. Seeing my very dilated kidney on my smartphone screen helped to confirm the diagnosis that I had a kidney stone. The CT scan later ordered by my doctor showed a nearly identical image, but the charge for that was $2,200. If this single tool was used in a typical office visit, a large proportion of expensive and unnecessary formal scans could be avoided.Smart medicine can also bring some sanity to how we handle medical screening, which today results in an epidemic of misdiagnoses and unnecessary procedures and treatments. The leading culprits are routine tests for breast and prostate cancer for individuals at low risk for these diseases. Because the tests have such extraordinarily high rates of false positives, they result all too often in biopsies, radiation and surgery for people in no medical danger.It would not be hard to use screening tests in a more discriminating way, for the much smaller population that really should worry about certain serious health problems. Genome sequencing for an individual\u2014identifying all three billion base pairs in a person\u2019s genetic makeup\u2014can now be done for about $1,000, and we know a great deal about which genes predispose someone to conditions such as cancer and heart disease. Guided by genomic risk scores that can be determined with an inexpensive device known as a gene \u201cchip\u201d\u2014and, of course, by family histories and clinical examinations\u2014doctors could spare many families from the ordeal of unnecessary treatment while making a dent in the $15 billion spent each year in the U.S. on mass screening for breast and prostate cancer.Routine use of individual genetic information could also allow us to prescribe drugs more effectively, avoiding the waste, in clinical time and in money, caused by medications that misfire. More than 130 drugs in common use have an FDA label for DNA data\u2014that is, they provide peer-reviewed research instructing doctors about dosage, side effects and potential responsiveness for patients with particular genetic profiles. But with rare exceptions outside of some cancer treatment centers, doctors in the U.S. don\u2019t obtain such data before prescribing drugs. That\u2019s a shame, because the relevant genetic information for each patient could be determined easily and inexpensively from saliva DNA at an office visit or even a pharmacy.For its part, the drug industry needs to make genetic information available for far more drugs by making it a regular part of testing. This R&D effort would be inexpensive relative to the cost of developing a new drug, and it could make medications far more efficient, upping the response rate and averting dangerous side effects.Smart medicine can also transform the doctor-patient relationship. Most medical services today are still provided in the traditional outpatient setting of a doctor\u2019s office. It takes an average of 3.4 weeks to get a primary care appointment in the U.S., and there\u2019s little time allotted for each visit. Most doctors provide a minimum of eye-to-eye contact as they busily record the session on a keyboard.The frustrations and inefficiencies of this system are obvious\u2014and unnecessary. In the era of telemedicine consults, there is no reason to wait weeks for an appointment. For the same copay as an office visit, connection with a doctor can occur instantly or within minutes. With increasing use of patient-generated data from sensors and physical exam hardware that connects with a smartphone, the video chats of today will soon be enriched by extensive data transfer.Indeed, obtaining patient data solely from the occasional office visit is no way to get a full picture of someone\u2019s health or to assess their medical needs. As more people generate and maintain their own medical data, they will carry this information around with them, no longer leaving it in the exclusive domain of doctors.At the Scripps Research Institute, we are working with the support of a National Institutes of Health grant and several local partners to develop a comprehensive \u201chealth record of the future\u201d for individual patients. It will combine all the usual medical data\u2014from office visits, labs, scans\u2014with data generated by personal sensors, including sleep, physical activity, weight, environment, blood pressure and other relevant medical metrics. All of it will be constantly and seamlessly updated and owned by the individual patient.Such medical data belongs to us rather than to our doctors\u2014it\u2019s about our bodies, after all, and we generate and pay for much of it. But it will also make our medical care more exact, more precisely tailored, as we move from doctor to doctor, depending on our needs at a particular moment. It will make unnecessary the billions of dollars spent each year in the duplication of labs and scans. Personal medical data\u2014stored in a cloud or using blockchain technology, a kind of digital ledger\u2014also will be more secure and relatively immune to hacking, compared with data sitting on massive servers.Having such data readily available will be vital to reaching the next stage of smart medicine, with virtual medical coaches. Just as we have adopted Alexa, Siri and Cortana for daily activities, we are headed to a time in the years ahead when our continuously updated personal medical data will provide health guidance. Consider the diabetic whose blood sugar sensor indicates that control is slipping because of lack of sleep or physical activity, or the asthmatic whose sensors show reduced lung function before any symptoms occur, so that she can adjust her medications. Refined feedback, through text, voice or avatar, will ultimately lead to better prevention and management of medical conditions.The revolution in patient data will empower doctors too, particularly as artificial intelligence matures into practical technologies. Researchers at Google DeepMind and Stanford University have recently shown the great potential of \u201cdeep learning\u201d\u2014computers that grow ever smarter through the continuous analysis of new data\u2014for accurate interpretation of medical scans, pathology slides and skin lesions, on par with doctors. In a paper last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, authors Andrew Beam and Isaac Kohane, specialists in biomedical informatics, calculated that advances in artificial intelligence now make it possible for computers to read as many as 260 million medical scans in a day, at a cost of $1,000. The advances in diagnostic power would be enormous, to say nothing of the cost savings.So why have we been so slow to adopt and encourage these potential solutions? Medicine is hard to change, especially when reforms threaten established modes of payment and the customary control of patients. And like everyone else, doctors are seldom eager for extensive new training. But our current course of medical spending and practice is unsustainable, and no change in how we handle health insurance is likely to alter that reality.Fortunately, serious ventures in smart medicine are well along. My colleagues and I at the Scripps Research Institute are leading the Participant Center of the NIH\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiative, which is currently enrolling one million Americans. Volunteers in the program will be testing many of the new tools I have described here. The recently formed nonprofit Health Transformation Alliance, which includes more than 40 large companies providing health benefits to 6.5 million employees and family members, intends to address the high cost of health care by focusing on, among other things, the sophisticated use of personal data.Physicians will also need to be trained to use the new technologies, from interpreting genomic data to using a smartphone for ultrasound. The FDA recently announced a broad initiative to foster innovation in digital health devices, with the intent to streamline the regulatory review process.But more could certainly be done to move us toward better health outcomes at lower costs. Perhaps some enterprising member of Congress will propose a Frugal Health Care Innovation Act, providing government incentives for technology, research and implementation. Such public support for electric cars has rapidly changed the face of the whole auto industry. American medicine today is no less antiquated than the Detroit of a generation ago, and it needs to find its way into the present century.Dr. Topol is a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego and the author of \u201cThe Patient Will See You Now: The Future of Medicine Is in Your Hands\u201d (Basic Books, 2015).

He spoke with       Marc Myers.I first heard Big Country\u2019s \u201cIn a Big Country\u201d in 1983, just after the song was released. I was 15 and reading in my parents\u2019 living room in Glasgow, Scotland, with \u201cTop of the Pops\u201d on TV. As soon as I heard       Stuart Adamson\u2019s       guitar evoking the sound of the bagpipes, my head snapped up.At the time, everyone I knew was into the new romantics and synth-pop bands, which I found a bit vapid. I also detested the bagpipes, which sounded like a tourist-shop notion of Scottishness. But Adamson\u2019s guitar captured the pipes in a way that was just Scottish enough.His chords were reminiscent of a soaring Celtic folk song and awakened in me a sense of Scotland as a place both ancient and modern. Scotland\u2019s countryside has an epic landscape that inspires optimism and storytelling. The song lifted me up the same way.\u201cIn a Big Country\u201d is about hope and defiance: \u201cPull up your head off the floor, come up screaming / Cry out for everything you ever might have wanted.\u201dTwo years later, when I was 17, I was at a Glasgow University orientation retreat, just before starting my first year. I was helping to clean up after dinner when I made a silly joke and watched as a woman walked out of the room.When I caught up with her later at the pub, it turned out she hadn\u2019t even heard me. We got to talking about music. The first band she mentioned was Big Country, and we talked about what \u201cIn a Big Country\u201d meant to us. Marisa and I began dating, and we married in 1991.Several years ago, we were on a drive up through Glencoe in the Scottish Highlands. The region offers some of the most beautiful, dramatic views of imposing, jagged mountains and dark streams, with the sun sliding in and out from behind the clouds.As we drove along the winding roads, I put on \u201cIn a Big Country.\u201d Marisa and I looked at each other.

He was performing in public for the first time in 40 years, and as he sat down at the piano to play the introductory song for \u201cDriving Miss Daisy,\u201d a 1989 film whose score he wrote, stage fright overwhelmed him. \u201cI thought I should apologize to everyone and tell them that I made a terrible mistake,\u201d he says. Sensing Mr. Zimmer\u2019s anxiety, one of the musicians on stage accompanying him told him to smile. \u201cYou can\u2019t quite retain the angst and all that Germanic-ness if you have a little bit of a smile on your face,\u201d he says.Mr. Zimmer, 59, has composed more than 100 original film scores, earning nine Academy Award nominations and one win for best original score for \u201cThe Lion King\u201d (1994). Other films include the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d series, \u201cGladiator\u201d (2000) and \u201cInterstellar\u201d (2014). Now he\u2019s about to embark on the U.S. leg of his show, \u201cHans Zimmer Live,\u201d playing songs from his films. It kicks off in Dallas on July 13 and runs through mid-August.\u201cThis is the opposite of my normal life, where I\u2019m thinking about long, dramatic arcs\u201d in movies, he says. On tour, he has to be in the moment. \u201cIf I even try to think 30 seconds ahead, I will play badly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a learning curve for me, actually.\u201dHis goal when writing a score is to make both audiences and himself happy. The latter isn\u2019t easy. \u201cNothing leaves my studio unless I\u2019m happy with it,\u201d he says. He quickly adds, \u201c\u2018Happy\u2019 is a big word. Let\u2019s say \u2018slightly less unhappy.\u2019 \u201dMr. Zimmer started playing piano when he was a child in Frankfurt. His mother was a classical pianist, and his father, an engineer, died when he was young. Mr. Zimmer preferred composing his own music to learning to play others\u2019 songs. As a teenager, he moved to London to play keyboard and synthesizers in a band. He went on to produce music for groups such as the Buggles, who released the 1979 hit song \u201cVideo Killed the Radio Star.\u201dHe took up film composing in the early 1980s because he thought that staying in a band would confine him to making the same kind of music. In London, he began apprenticing for the composer Stanley Myers, whose scores featured in films such as \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d (1978) and \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette\u201d (1985).Mr. Zimmer was soon working on his own. He got his first Oscar nomination for the 1988 Dustin Hoffman-Tom Cruise film \u201cRain Man.\u201d After working on the movie in Los Angeles, he decided to stay there. As he says, \u201cI sort of got stuck.\u201dWhen developing a score, Mr. Zimmer begins by asking the director to tell him the story of the movie. \u201cA good director is by nature a great storyteller,\u201d he says. \u201cI actually get far more than I would get from the script.\u201d When he started to work on \u201cInterstellar,\u201d director Christopher Nolan didn\u2019t tell him the story; instead, Mr. Nolan gave him a page-long fable about what it meant to be a father. Mr. Zimmer came up with a fragile, intimate tune based on the fable and was surprised when he found out that the movie was an epic space odyssey (though it did have two narratives about father-daughter relationships).On any movie, Mr. Zimmer\u2019s goal is to add to the story: \u201cYour job is to invent, and your job is not to be a slave to the movie but to elevate it somehow and bring your own personality into it.\u201dHe says that he has an easier time expressing himself in music than in English or even in his native German. When he records a score, he often works with musicians from other countries. He remembers working with one musician on \u201cGladiator\u201d who barely spoke English. \u201cI think the most conversation we ever had was \u2018hello,\u2019 \u2018good night,\u2019 and a raised eyebrow when you played the wrong note,\u201d he says with a laugh.Mr. Zimmer lives in Los Angeles with his second wife, Suzanne. They have three teenage children together, and he has a 29-year-old daughter from a previous marriage. He spends most days in his studio in Santa Monica. \u201cI force myself to sit on my hands and not touch the keyboard until I have actually an idea in my head, because otherwise it\u2019s just muscle memory,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just playing stuff from the last movie.\u201d\u2018You want as much silence around you as possible.\u2019He\u2019s in his studio on weekends, too. \u201cWeekends for me are the most perfect time because nobody phones and you can get more writing done,\u201d he says. He sometimes sees friends. \u201cThey put up with [the fact] that we start a thought three years\u2026before we get to finish it because I got sidetracked into a piece of music,\u201d he says.He generally doesn\u2019t listen to other music. \u201cIt just sort of confuses me because when you\u2019re writing, you\u2019re trying to sneak up on an idea, and they have a habit of being elusive and disappearing too quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want as much silence around you as possible.\u201dOne of his next scores will appear in \u201cDunkirk,\u201d a World War II thriller directed by Mr. Nolan that will be released later this month. The score, he says, is based on long conversations that he had with the director. \u201cI usually start hearing musical ideas in my head while he discusses his story with me,\u201d he says.He is driven by his love of coming up with sounds and melodies. \u201cDeadlines are great motivators,\u201d he says, but what really excites him is the point when a tune suddenly comes to him and he starts seeing one note after another in his head. \u201cThat moment is so delicious that nothing can quite beat it.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-07 12:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hans-zimmer-movie-maestro-1499443332", "news_title": "Hans Zimmer, Movie Maestro", "keywords": " film scores,hans zimmer, movies, movie scores,music,music composition,awards,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,interviews"}, {"content": "Investors are dumping government bonds, certain that the European Central Bank will soon start dialing back the massive stimulus that has buoyed\u00a0markets.They are less sure what that tapering will look like\u2014a key question as the ECB becomes the main focus for spooked investors around the world.Many market participants are betting that officials will reduce bond purchases from\u00a0\u20ac60 billion ($69 billion)\u00a0to \u20ac40 billion during the first half of next year and then cut them to \u20ac20 billion in the second. But there are other options investors are considering, from tapering less to following the Federal Reserve\u2019s model of reducing the buying on a monthly basis.Whatever the ECB does, investors expect volatility along the way.In the wake of the financial crisis central banks cut interest rates to record lows and bought billions of dollars of assets, pushing up bond prices and sending investors chasing returns into equity and emerging markets.Because such monetary policy was so experimental in implementation, there is little precedent in what to expect in the retreat.\u201cWhen we are in the territory of unconventional monetary policy, expectations of what the central bank will do in the future have no anchor,\u201d said       Willem Verhagen,        a senior economist at NN Investment Partners, which has\u00a0about \u20ac200 billion under management.ECB President       Mario Draghi       kicked off the bond selloff last week with bullish comments about the eurozone economy that investors saw as heralding tighter monetary policy.Yields on 10-year German bonds, which move opposite to prices, closed at 0.568% on Friday, the highest in 18 months, compared with 0.247% the day before Mr. Draghi\u2019s speech. Treasury 10-year yields traded at 2.388% from 2.143%. The euro has gained more than 2% over this period.Yet markets were broadly unchanged by Fed minutes\u00a0on Wednesday, which showed no clear consensus on how the central bank should unwind a portfolio of bonds that has been unchanged since 2014.Most investors expect the ECB to announce the future of its bond buying as soon as September.Aside from recent selling, another clue to what investors expect lies in derivatives markets that currently predict the ECB\u2019s first interest rate rise will be in December next year.\u00a0The ECB has said it would only raise rates, currently at\u00a0minus\u00a00.4%,\u00a0once it has stopped buying bonds, suggesting that investors believe that time will be before next December.Buying less than \u20ac40 billion worth of bonds a month would be seen as a tightening of policy, said       Thomas Page-Lecuyer,        a strategist at CPR Asset Management, leading to a larger selloff in eurozone bonds and a further rally in the euro.There are other alternatives. The ECB could also follow in the Fed\u2019s footsteps and announce that purchases will be smaller each successive month, reaching zero at the end of the year. That would likely boost bonds and depress the currency, investors say.\u201cIf they were to give a clear date for the end of\u00a0purchases, that would be a hawkish surprise for us and many in the market,\u201d said\u00a0      Iain Stealey,        a fund manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Many investors think this is unlikely, however, because ECB officials will want flexibility. They see the Fed as a cautionary tale, after it triggered a\u00a0big bond selloff when announcing in 2013 that it would taper asset purchases.\u201cThe experience in the U.S. was very painful, and that\u2019s what the ECB wants to avoid,\u201d said       Franck Dixmier,        global head of fixed income at Allianz Global Investors, which has \u20ac480 billion assets under management.Still, the\u00a0ECB\u2019s\u00a0ability to be flexible is limited by the fact that it may run out of bonds to buy in key markets. It is already undershooting the target for German debt, official data shows.Commerzbank AG       said at a rate of\u00a0\u20ac40 billion a month, the ECB could keep buying bonds\u00a0until mid-2019.Some see another factor hurrying the ECB to the exit sign\u2014the eurozone\u2019s increasingly robust economy.Analysts see the eurozone economy expanding 1.8% this year and the unemployment rate close to 9%, its lowest since early 2009. So\u00a0why would\u00a0Mr. Draghi keep stimulating an economy that was already motoring ahead?But even that is up for debate. Growth may be increasing but inflation isn\u2019t. In June, prices rose 1.3% from a year earlier, far from the ECB\u2019s target of close but below 2%.Should the ECB start tapering its bond buying next year, don\u2019t necessarily expect a sudden fall in bond prices. The central bank has no plans of selling back any of the roughly \u20ac2.3 trillion worth of assets it will have bought by that point. There\u00a0are also other buyers out there. Pension funds and insurers are still desperate for places to put their money that offers stable income.\u201cWhile we think markets are enthusiastic in their expectations for policy normalization, we should not forget recent market movements,\u201d said       Andrew Bosomworth,        head of portfolio management in Germany for Pacific Investment Management Co. \u201cNew Normal bond yields are therefore likely to prevail.\u201dWrite to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.comAppeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'Investors Brace for ECB\u2019s Unwind.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 11:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-markets-big-question-what-will-ecb-tapering-look-like-1499434243", "news_title": "Global Markets\u2019 Biggest Question: What Will ECB Tapering Look Like?

TEVA -0.09%      , from making a generic form of Alimta before the patent expires in June 2021. The Supreme Court also upheld the U.K. Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling the products from Actavis indirectly infringed on Lilly\u2019s patents as well.The court\u2019s full judgment is expected to be handed down Wednesday, Lilly said.Actavis filed suit more than three years ago to commercialize alternative forms of pemetrexed, the active ingredient in Alimta, diluted in saline solution, claiming it wouldn\u2019t infringe on patents for Alimta in the U.K., France, Italy and Spain.Teva completed its $40.5 billion acquisition of Actavis from             Allergan        AGN 0.28%       PLC in 2016.

It has previously said the Alimta vitamin regimen patents were \u201cvalid and enforceable\u201d against generic drug manufacturers.Alimta treats mesothelioma, a rare cancer linked to asbestos exposure. Sales of the product totaled about $2.28 billion for Lilly in 2016, about 11% of its overall revenue.The drug consists of the compound patent, which covers the basic chemical composition of the drugs. A second patent\u2014the one that was under review\u2014covers the method of administering Alimta to patients with certain vitamins designed to mitigate side effects.Lilly\u2019s shares, up 11% this year, rose 0.6% to $82.08 Friday.

Now he and filmmaking partner Murray Miller have turned their absurdist eye, naturally, to my beloved sport of pro cycling: \u201cTour de Pharmacy,\u201d which premieres on HBO Saturday July 8, is a ridiculous but rooted-in-reality look at a vintage bike race unravelled by drugs, credit card debt, pansexual intrigue, and, of course, really tremendous spandex. Its \u201cCannonball Run\u201d-style cast includes Samberg, Julia Ormond, Orlando Bloom, Daveed Diggs, Jeff Goldblum, Mike Tyson, Danny Glover and wrestler-turned-actor John Cena, and even an \u201canonymous\u201d cameo from a scandalized former cycling star whose face you\u2019ll surely recognize. I spoke to Samberg the other day about the movie. (Disclosure: I\u2019ve been working with HBO on a separate project unrelated to Samberg\u2019s film.)From marathon tennis...to pro cycling. Why?It seemed like we could do funny stuff with it. That\u2019s all we\u2019re ever really going for\u2014trying to think of as many jokes and bits as we can stuff into one frame. We\u2019re trying to start this [ESPN] \u201c30-for-30\u201d style comedy thing for HBO called \u201cLegends of Sport,\u201d we were trying to find which sport we\u2019d do next. Cycling was one of the ideas that we got really excited about.How much familiarity did you have with pro cycling beforehand?We had kind of a baseline knowledge, but we both did research, Murray especially, and we watched a ton of documentaries and read books and got to be more well-versed. Learned the word \u2018peloton.\u2019 (Laughs) Even though cycling and tennis are two of the biggest sports in the world, it\u2019s fun to work in a sport that\u2019s not quite as big in America, because we can take a lot more creative license.I\u2019ve always felt cycling looks crazy to the outsider, but once you get inside, it\u2019s even crazier.As we learned more about it, the more we realized, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s going to take some pretty crazy stuff to top this.\u2019 The [Tour de France], when it was created, was sort of created to be impossible, and physically the riders couldn\u2019t get through it. They were drinking beer, wine \u2014And smoking!There\u2019s this one story where a guy actually left the race, took a train, and rejoined the race. Things like that that are so cartoony, you can\u2019t believe they happened. But apparently they did.Who was the most talented cyclist in your cast?That would be a two-way tie between Orlando Bloom and James Marsden. They\u2019re both very very good cyclists who have done [triathlons] and stuff.The cycling costumes are basically a character in the film.We knew going in that putting John Cena in pink spandex was going to be awesome. We had a lot of fun designing that stuff.And the cameo from the very well-known pro cyclist whose name I won\u2019t mention?That was something Murray wrote into the script and we were laughing about it. We were like, \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he will ever do it, but we probably should ask.\u201d We hopped on the phone and he thought it was funny and was up for it\u2014we sent him a bunch of weird stuff, and he was game for all of it.Why do you think you\u2019re drawn to making these kind of sports doc-comedies? Is there something fertile about sports in general?There\u2019s always been good material in sports comedy, whether you\u2019re talking about \u201cCaddyshack,\u201d or \u201cHappy Gilmore\u201d or all that kind of stuff. This felt like a new way to do it that combines what [\u201cBest In Show\u201d creator] Christopher Guest does with what bigger, broader sports comedy does.

Cranking up the screen\u2019s brightness can help, and many smartphones do this automatically, but that can sap battery life. Various antireflective coatings and screen covers typically involve trade-offs in durability, performance and expense.That\u2019s where moths come into the picture. Inspired by the unusual structure of the insects\u2019 eyes, researchers at the University of Central Florida and two universities in Taiwan have invented a durable new coating that sharply cuts the reflected light coming off a clear surface without impairing clarity.The scientists say that the material can work for screens large and small and can resist smudges and scratches. The new coatings require a careful fabrication process, which the scientists are still tweaking. But they believe the process can eventually be economical on an industrial scale.The researchers were drawn to moths by the work of other scientists, who had created coatings based on moths\u2019 eyes to reduce the reflectiveness of solar panels. Moths\u2019 eyes are strongly antireflective, thanks to a pattern of infinitesimal dimples on the surface. Those dimples help the insects to see at night and also prevent light from being reflected, thus keeping their eyes from disclosing their position to predators. A similar coating can boost the efficiency of solar panels by letting more light enter and become electricity.Aware of these results, the scientists in Florida and Taiwan wondered if they could overcome fabrication problems to bring the same technology to bear on smartphones and the like. In a new scientific article, the researchers say that their coating demonstrated a measured surface reflection of 0.23%\u2014far less than the 4% to 5% that is typical of smartphones, according to Guanjun Tan, one of the scientists. He adds that the figure is lower than the reduced reflectiveness offered by many alternative coatings, which might register in the 2% range.In sunlight, the scientists report, glass coated with the new material improved the contrast ratio by a factor of 4\u2014and by a factor of 10 in shade. To allow for the more advanced touch screens that the scientists anticipate coming to market in the years ahead, they made the new coating work on flexible and even foldable surfaces and on curves.Adapting the moths\u2019 eye structure to consumer electronics posed challenges. For example, the dimples had to be tinier than a moth\u2019s to minimize reflections without impairing transparency, so they are just a thousandth of the breadth of a human hair. This in turn required a precise fabrication process. A silicon dioxide template was used to imprint the nano-pattern of dimples on a thin layer of rubber and acrylate coating material. The former contributes flexibility, the latter hardness, and the proportions can be adjusted depending on the desired trade-off.The scientists report that they succeeded in using their coating on glass and on two types of flexible plastics.\u201cBroadband Antireflection Film With Moth-eye-like Structure for Flexible Display Applications,\u201d Guanjun Tan, Jiun-Haw Lee, Yi-Hsin Lan, Mao-Kuo Wei, Lung-Han Peng, I-Chun Cheng and Shin-Tson Wu, Optica (June 22)", "news_time": "2017-07-07 11:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/moths-help-scientists-attack-glare-1499441398", "news_title": "Moths Help Scientists Attack Glare", "keywords": " development, electronics, glare,moths, phone screens, research, science, tablet screens, technology,political,general news,living,lifestyle,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications technology,equipment,mobile communications equipment,personal electronics,cellular,mobile phones,handheld electronic devices,smartphones,technology"}, {"content": "Georgia\u2019s public health commissioner was named director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday, ending months of speculation over who would fill a critical role leading an agency in charge of public health matters from battling epidemics to vaccination policy.The Trump administration named       Brenda Fitzgerald       to succeed       Thomas Frieden,        who served as director from 2009 until January.\u00a0      Anne Schuchat,        a CDC veteran, has been acting director of the Atlanta-based agency since then and will return now to her previous role as principal deputy director, the Department of Health and Human Services said.Dr. Fitzgerald is an obstetrician-gynecologist who has practiced in Georgia for three decades and has served as commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health and state health officer since 2011. She has close relationships with Republican political leaders from the state, including HHS Secretary       Tom Price       and       Newt Gingrich,        the former U.S. Speaker of the House, for whom she worked as a health-care policy adviser.\u00a0 She ran unsuccessfully for Congress twice in the early 1990s.\u201cHaving known Dr. Fitzgerald for many years, I know that she has a deep appreciation and understanding of medicine, public health, policy and leadership\u2014all qualities that will prove vital as she leads the CDC in its work to protect America\u2019s health 24/7,\u201d Secretary Price said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to working with Dr. Fitzgerald to achieve President Trump\u2019s goal of strengthening public health surveillance and ensuring global health security at home and abroad.\u201dDr. Fitzgerald will assume her role at a critical time for the CDC. The agency faces huge potential cutbacks to its budget, at the same time that it is under pressure to fight a greater number of infectious disease threats. It led the U.S. responses to the Zika epidemic in the Americas last year, as well as the 2014 Ebola in West Africa, where the agency is still involved. It is also at the forefront of public health battles against more antibiotic-resistant infections, food-borne outbreaks, and the obesity epidemic.Dr. Fitzgerald\u2019s background in public health, rather than medicine, isn\u2019t as deep as that of many previous CDC directors\u2014many of whom have master\u2019s degrees in public health, or trained as epidemiologists. But she is well regarded by public health officials and was the president-elect of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\u201cDr. Fitzgerald is more than prepared to face the health challenges of our time, including climate change, Zika, Ebola, and our growing burden of chronic disease,\u201d       Georges Benjamin,        executive director, of the American Public Health Association, said in a statement. \u201cShe has shown tremendous leadership in the fields of maternal and child health, making early childhood development a priority throughout her work in Georgia.\u201d\u201cBrenda Fitzgerald understands the relationship between the CDC and state and local health departments, and I\u2019m confident she\u2019ll advocate for a strong public health system,\u201d said Michael Eriksen, dean of Georgia State University\u2019s School of Public Health, and a former CDC and World Health Organization official. The CDC needs \u201ca strong leader who can advocate for the organization,\u201d he said.The Georgia Department of Public Health under Dr. Fitzgerald\u2019s leadership is credited with effective preparations for domestic threats of both Ebola and Zika. State public health officials worked closely with Emory University and the CDC when four Ebola patients, and others exposed to Ebola, were treated at Emory.State health officials also developed a web portal that was seen by other states as a model for managing visitors returning from Ebola-affected countries. Those visitors\u2013including health-care workers who had treated Ebola patients\u2013had to be monitored daily for 21 days after their return. The portal asked them to log in their temperatures and symptoms, rather than report them by phone to a public health worker.Dr. Fitzgerald did her medical training at Emory and Emory-Grady hospitals in Atlanta.

Vardaman       from the building now known as Vardaman Hall.According to a report by the school committee, Mr. Vardaman, a local publisher who served as Mississippi governor from 1903 to 1908 and represented the state in the U.S. Senate from 1913 to 1919, was \u201cdistinctly unworthy of honor.\u201dCiting standards set by Yale University when it reviewed the name of Calhoun College, the committee said Mr. Vardaman was exceptional for his time because he \u201cactively promoted some morally odious practice, or dedicated much of [his life] to upholding the practice.\u201dA vehement opponent of educating African-Americans and advocate of white supremacy, Mr. Vardaman said at a public event while governor, \u201cIf it is necessary every Negro in the state will be lynched; it will be done to maintain white supremacy.\u201dThe committee cited that quote as part of its explanation for the renaming.The University of Mississippi also said that while it won\u2019t change the names of other campus buildings and sites that honor slave owners or proponents of slavery who had ties to the school, it will add plaques providing more information about the namesakes. For example, Barnard Observatory is named for a former university president and chancellor who owned slaves and was criticized for not being sufficiently proslavery, while Lamar Hall is named for a former professor and Congressman who, according to the committee report, played an active role in \u201cdismantling Reconstruction in Mississippi to the detriment of the state\u2019s African-American citizens.\u201dThe university will also install a plaque noting that four projects on campus were built with slave labor.\u201cContextualization is an important extension of a university\u2019s responsibility to educate and provides an opportunity to learn from history,\u201d Chancellor Jeffrey Vitter said, commending the committee for \u201crecognizing that while our history is not by any means all that we are, it remains an important part of who we are.\u201dA new name for Vardaman hasn\u2019t yet been chosen. The school said it would begin that process as it renovates the building.A number of cities and schools, especially in the South, in recent years have been reconsidering how they acknowledge their historical ties to slavery or to the Confederacy.In 2015, Ole Miss removed the state flag, which includes the Confederate battle emblem, and since then other public universities in Mississippi have followed suit.Vanderbilt University last summer said it would pay $1.2 million to a United Daughters of the Confederacy group to remove the word \u201cConfederate\u201d from a residence hall\u2019s facade, while Princeton University last year said it would provide more information about President       Woodrow Wilson\u2019s       \u201cfailings and shortcomings\u201d but stopped short of renaming its school of public and international affairs or a residential college.Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.comAppeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'Ole Miss To Rename Campus Building.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 11:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/university-of-mississippi-will-remove-name-of-white-supremacist-from-building-1499440359", "news_title": "University of Mississippi Will Remove Name of White Supremacist From Building ", "keywords": "african-americans,name,racism,slavery,university of mississippi,vardaman hall,white supremacy,University of Mississippi,James K.

Many concede that the stock market is efficient, but they believe the bond market is inefficient and a good active bond-fund manager can select bonds that will outperform.These people point out that, unlike stock funds, bond index funds tend to lag behind their peers. Indeed, according to Morningstar Inc., as of June 29, the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (ticker: AGG) has been outperformed by 65% of its peers over the past five years, and 53% over the past 10. It did, however, beat 65% over the past three years. The majority of those peers were actively managed funds.Since this bond fund follows the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index of most U.S. investment-grade bonds, it certainly appears that bond indexing has failed. The index includes all fixed-rate investment-grade taxable bonds; only Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and municipal bonds are excluded.But why should the bond market be less efficient? Just because there are many more bonds than stocks is not a good reason. So I dug into Morningstar data to see if there was some explanation for the apparent disconnect. Specifically, I looked at credit quality, also known as default risk, and compared the iShares bond fund to the average of all non-indexed bond funds in the investment-grade intermediate term category against which Morningstar ranks this fund against.The findings were striking, as the active funds in the category took on far more credit risk.While I knew AGG would have virtually no bonds below investment grade, I was surprised to find the average on the non-indexed peers being compared to AGG had nearly 10% junk (those rated below triple-B) or not rated. Many funds in the peer group had 20% or more junk.And even the credit quality within investment grade was quite different. AGG had nearly 72% in triple-A-rated bonds (mostly U.S. government and government agency bonds) while the non-indexed peers had only a bit over 52%. The non-indexed peers also had significantly more triple-B-rated bonds, the lowest category of investment grade, than AGG.Sarah Bush, Morningstar\u2019s director of fixed-income manager research, said the category typically allows a fund to hold up to 35% junk. She noted that the active peers as a group are taking on more credit risk, and the more credit risk they take on, the likelier they are to suffer losses when stocks tumble.Ms. Bush rejected the notion that their peer rating showed indexing didn\u2019t work with bonds, saying a high-credit-quality bond fund is likely to perform well when stocks plunge. In fact, AGG gained 7.90% in 2008, when stocks plunged, while the average bond fund lost about 8%, according to Morningstar. She added, however, that though fees matter, she believes active bond managers can add value.My conclusions: Indexing works in bonds, and the claims that active funds as a whole are beating passive funds are wrong. Riskier bonds take on some equity characteristics and do generally outperform in bull stock markets, but they get clobbered when stocks plunge. Active funds taking on more credit risk don\u2019t serve the role of diversification from stocks when they move in the same direction as stocks. Perhaps that\u2019s why Morningstar shows investors have worse timing on active bond funds than passive. This is because we tend to sell a bond fund after it declines.The role of fixed income is to act as a shock absorber when stocks tank. The higher the credit quality, the better the odds it will serve this role. Reaching for income is a mistake. Whether you believe in active or passive fixed-income strategies, keeping your credit quality high and your fees low increase the probabilities of success.\u2014Allan S.

It will turn red.That might seem trivial and obvious. Showing losses in red ink (or pixels) and gains in green is just an arbitrary convention. It\u2019s the size, not the color, of your changes in wealth that should matter. But new research shows that color is another of the many intangible forces that can have a powerful influence on investors\u2019 behavior.In a series of experiments, finance scholars William Bazley and Henrik Cronqvist of the University of Miami, along with marketing professor Milica Mormann of Southern Methodist University, have found that seeing red has a drastic effect on how people view investments.The researchers offered basic choices like these: Would you rather have a 70% chance of winning $2 and a 30% chance of losing $1.50, or a 70% chance of winning $4 and a 30% chance of losing $5? Merely by displaying the potential losses in red rather than black, the researchers could make people about 25% more risk averse (preferring the first gamble to the second, even though the latter has a higher expected value).Likewise, investors viewed charts of stocks in the S&P 500 index with falling prices and predicted how the shares would perform in the next six months. Those who saw charts in red, rather than black, projected significantly lower returns.A loss displayed in red feels hotter and more painful than a loss of the identical amount shown in black. It also alters your view of the future. \u201cSimply seeing a stock\u2019s price shown in red,\u201d says Prof. Cronqvist, \u201ccan make you think it will go down and keep going down.\u201dHe and his colleagues found one group of people who don\u2019t turn pessimistic and risk averse when losses are shown in red: those who are colorblind.Does this sound far-fetched? More often than any of us care to admit, investors\u2019 behavior is shaped by what       Richard Thaler,        an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, calls SIFs, \u201csupposedly irrelevant factors\u201d rooted in mood and emotion.How much risk you are willing to take can depend on such SIFs as how an investment is described; whether you are feeling happy, hungry, sad or angry; how sunny it is; the time of day and the time of year; whether your favorite sports team won or lost; whether you recently saw news of a tragedy, and so on.These are all what psychologists call \u201cunconscious biases\u201d\u2014forces that sway your decisions even though you may not be aware of them.Color is in the same family of insidious influences.Red stands for anger and danger, stoplights and stop signs, hot stoves, firetrucks, warning lights and panic buttons. We have red alerts, red flags and red devils. Imagine how you would react if you walked outside and saw the green grass turn suddenly scarlet.Red isn\u2019t always negative, of course. It\u2019s also the color of love and warmth, roses, strawberries and other nice things. But, at least in the U.S., red generally conveys risk just as green evokes safety. Americans have used \u201cin the red\u201d to signify financial losses since at least the 1920s, says etymologist Barry Popik.Now consider that the websites and apps of many U.S. brokerages and investment firms show losses in hot red (and gains in bright green).\u201cThere\u2019s excitement that goes with that, a little bit of Las Vegas,\u201d says Daniel Egan, director of behavioral finance and investments at Betterment, the New York-based \u201crobo adviser\u201d or automated investing firm. Showing gains and losses in bright colors may make customers more inclined to trade, he says.\u201cWe know that people overreact to their returns over short periods of time,\u201d says Mr. Egan. \u201cColor can reinforce that reaction and double down on the emotion.\u201dAs a result, he says, Betterment recently overhauled its website and apps so that a muted red shows up only when investors are falling short of their long-term goals. Short-term price changes aren\u2019t color-coded.It might feel good nowadays to look at your accounts online and see nothing but green. That will change when the stock market starts going down. Looking at your losses then, if they are displayed in red, will make them burn like fire.Investing apps and websites don\u2019t offer the option to view portfolios in black and white.

The New York activist investor needs to be careful it doesn\u2019t clench the fist it is trying to pry open.On Friday, Elliott announced a near doubling of its stake in the Dutch paint group to 9.5% or $2.1 billion, alongside a petition to a local court demanding an extraordinary general meeting so that shareholders can vote out Akzo Nobel Chairman       Antony Burgmans.       Elliott and other big shareholders interpreted Mr. Burgmans\u2019s dismissive handling of PPG\u2019s $27.6 billion trans-Atlantic takeover approach as a classic case of entrenched management. The shares trade well below PPG\u2019s offers.This is the third channel Elliott is navigating, having failed to get a shareholder meeting by appealing first to Akzo Nobel and then to the Enterprise Chamber, a Dutch platform for corporate appeals. The Enterprise Chamber gambit flopped because it was seen as an attempt to influence strategy, which is seen as a matter for management, not shareholders. Elliott\u2019s latest petition therefore makes a governance argument: that Mr. Burgmans has lost the confidence of shareholders.Whether or not the new legal approach works\u2014and Elliott\u2019s advice has been shaky in the past\u2014it could prove counterproductive. Mr. Burgmans\u2019s tenure as chairman is due to expire next April anyway.Akzo Nobel\u2019s short-term plan to sell or split out its specialty chemicals business is sensible, and should make the paint business easier to combine with PPG once Mr. Burgmans has retired. Elliott may feel it is worth keeping the pressure on Mr. Burgmans to ensure the sales process goes smoothly and benefits shareholders.But pushing hard could create other problems. The Dutch government is proposing a radical set of antitakeover measures for Dutch companies, inspired by the Akzo Nobel affair and Kraft Heinz\u2019s short-lived bid for Unilever, where Mr. Burgmans spent most of his career.Elliott is onto something: Akzo Nobel has a governance problem, and would be more valuable if it participated in the current round of chemicals consolidation.

Next, the company defaulted on nine separate corporate bonds, telling creditors that it lacked the money to pay its bills. Dongbei declared bankruptcy last October.In the fall of 2015, before Dongbei\u2019s slide into insolvency, Chinese President       Xi Jinping       had declared that Beijing would soon implement \u201csupply-side structural reforms\u201d to cut debt and overcapacity in Chinese industry. With its record of unprofitability, Dongbei might seem to be a perfect candidate for the policy.But Dongbei isn\u2019t being shut down. Nor is it being restructured. Courts in the troubled industrial province of Liaoning, where Dongbei is based, have yet again postponed discussion of the firm\u2019s restructuring plan. Rather than cutting output, the province\u2019s steel production hit a record in April, up 4.6% from last year. And Dongbei still owes $6.4 billion to Chinese banks, most of which will probably never get repaid.China has long relied on debt to fuel growth. The country\u2019s debt burden expanded over 2.5 times faster than its economy in 2016, and its ratio of corporate debt to GDP is one of the highest ever seen in a big economy.Mr. Xi has repeatedly said that China intends to cast off this model of development. Earlier this year, he declared that \u201cfinancial security\u201d\u2014including debt sustainability\u2014was key to China\u2019s \u201cnational security.\u201d But change has been slow, and as long as the government provides cheap loans to spendthrift provinces and bankrupt businesses, the risk of a debt-driven financial crisis will grow.Why can\u2019t China kick its debt addiction? The obstacles are political, not economic. Local governments and bosses of state-owned enterprises benefit immensely from government-subsidized loans, and these groups form the backbone of the Chinese Communist Party.After taking power in 1949, the party nationalized industry on the grounds that it needed to control the capitalists. \u201cTo exterminate the bourgeoisie and capitalism in China,\u201d Mao Zedong said, \u201cis a very good thing.\u201d Yet since the country cast off state socialism in the 1980s, crony capitalists have come to control the Communist Party.The most powerful business interests within the party are those that benefit most from cheap, state-funded lending, fueling China\u2019s debt bubble. The bosses of state-owned firms are in theory subordinate to the party hierarchy. In reality, they constitute a powerful lobby, demanding cheap loans from state banks and the ability to use public assets for the private interests of the monopolies they run. When Sinosteel appeared on the brink of bankruptcy several years ago, for example, regulators intervened, forcing state-owned banks to lend cheaply to the steel firm to keep it running.Provincial and local government officials are even more powerful than the bosses of state-owned firms. Real-estate development\u2014which is no less reliant on cheap credit\u2014has driven growth in many regions. It is also a lucrative source of corruption, as local officials sell off property to developers on the cheap in exchange for kickbacks. Last year, former Guangzhou Party Secretary Wan Qingliang was jailed for taking bribes from a real-estate developer in return for choice plots of land.Beijing regularly promises to restore party discipline, and doing so would help to restrain the political networks that take advantage of government-backed lending. Mr. Xi\u2019s anticorruption campaign, launched in 2012, ostensibly sought to punish the \u201ctigers\u201d in the party who used political power for personal gain.But Mr. Xi\u2019s net caught only his political rivals, from Zhou Yongkang, the former high-ranking security chief, to Ling Jihua, the party leader who was fired after his son\u2019s death in a Ferrari crash. Most of the business lobbies within the party that are loyal to Mr. Xi have not been touched.He is now preparing for a crucial party congress this autumn, when five new members will likely be appointed to China\u2019s seven-person Politburo Standing Committee. The event will shape China\u2019s political future for some time to come. To get his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s appointed, Mr. Xi needs support from various party elites, and a time-tested method for securing it is to supply subsidized credit to their provinces and enterprises, whatever the long-term cost. This is what has allowed bankrupt companies like Dongbei to get the credit that they need to keep running.Mr. Xi\u2019s supporters say that the president is tolerating debt growth today to achieve his political goals at the party congress. Off the record, Chinese economists promise that once Mr. Xi consolidates power, he will have the clout needed to push through tough reforms. But will the president really be willing to turn on his supporters immediately after the party congress?A decade ago, China\u2019s breakneck growth in debt could be explained as part of its effort to develop its financial markets. But returns to capital investment have fallen sharply since the early 2000s, according to research by the economists Chong-en Bai and Qiong Zhang. Despite this, debt-financed corporate investment continues to increase. A sizable portion of the new investment will prove unprofitable, at which point the debt that funded loss-making projects will pose risks to financial stability. China\u2019s corporate indebtedness is already near or above the levels that preceded the 1997 Asian financial crisis or the eurozone crisis.In advance of this year\u2019s party congress, Mr. Xi is committed to hitting China\u2019s 6.5% GDP growth target, even if it requires more wasteful, debt-financed stimulus. Letting big firms go bankrupt or tolerating local government defaults is impossible in China\u2019s equivalent of an election year.The argument that Mr. Xi can more easily tackle the debt burden once he has consolidated his political position is logical\u2014but it is the same promise that Beijing made in advance of the last party congress, five debt-fueled years ago. As Mao noted, Chinese officials \u201cfight among themselves for power and money; they extend their hands into the Party; they want fame and fortune.\u201d Mr. Xi can only tackle China\u2019s debt addiction if he is willing to take on his own party first.\u2014Ms. Han is a research analyst at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

Officials are stepping up efforts to engage with U.K. business leaders, who have complained their concerns about the possibility of an abrupt split from the EU were being ignored.David Davis,        the minister charged with overseeing Brexit,\u00a0on Friday hosted business leaders at his country residence as part of a new initiative for better coordination between the government and\u00a0industry\u2014the first major outreach effort.Because her authority has been dented, cabinet officials who have more leeway to express their opinions, said       Tim Bale,        politics professor at Queen Mary University of London.\u201cThey have more wiggle room because their boss isn\u2019t in charge in the same way she was before,\u201d Mr. Bale said.Mrs. May had ruled out the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the U.K., post-Brexit, and insisted that the U.K. wouldn\u2019t allow free movement of\u00a0EU\u00a0workers.She said the U.K. would pull out of the\u00a0EU\u2019s zone of common regulation, known as the single market, and its customs union in which members trade tariff-free and impose common external tariffs on imports from non-members.And while she also said she wanted \u201cfree and frictionless\u201d trade with the\u00a0EU\u00a0after Brexit, many businesses began to brace for a sharp rise in obstacles to trade with the\u00a0EU, which accounts for about 45% of U.K. exports.Carolyn Fairbairn,        director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, the country\u2019s leading business lobbying group, said in an interview Thursday that Brexit has increased anxieties among members about hiring staff, burdensome new customs procedures, increased tariffs and diverging regulation between U.K. business and its European customers.In a speech the same day, she called for a transitional agreement for after Britain leaves the EU to lessen the uncertainty that was already reducing investment by companies in the U.K. In this transition the U.K. should stay in the\u00a0EU\u2019s single market and its customs union, she said.That follows a call from       Philip Hammond,        the Treasury chief, who last week said that a transitional deal would be needed, saying politics shouldn\u2019t interfere with economic logic.In another sign that the government may be open to relenting on its tough stance,       Jeremy Hunt,        the health secretary, this week said the U.K. wants to work closely with the European Medicines Agency, the\u00a0EU\u00a0regulatory agency currently based in the U.K. He said the U.K. should be ready to accept some continued regulation from the bloc.Mr. Hunt previously said he didn\u2019t expect the U.K. to remain a member of the agency once it left the\u00a0EU.But even if the U.K. looks more amenable to accepting\u00a0EU\u00a0regulation in some areas as the price for better access to its market, there are big questions about whether the\u00a0EU\u00a0will accept it.In a blunt speech Thursday,       Michel Barnier,        the bloc\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, spelled out that Britain can\u2019t choose which parts of the single market it would like to participate in\u2014for instance automotive and financial services\u2014 and which it wouldn\u2019t.\u201cYou cannot be half-in and half-out of the single market,\u201d he said.Downing Street still says the election results haven\u2019t changed Britain\u2019s aims in negotiations. That was echoed by Defense Secretary       Michael Fallon       said\u00a0Wednesday that Britain\u2019s position on Brexit hadn\u2019t changed.\u201cThe red lines have not shifted,\u201d Mr. Fallon said in an interview. \u201cThe arithmetic in the [House of] Commons may have changed, but that does not shift the red lines themselves. There\u2019s a clear majority for getting on with Brexit.\u201dAnalysts say, however, Parliament\u2019s majority of pro-EU\u00a0lawmakers could put pressure on Mrs. May to take a softer approach. Lawmakers could also be influenced by a sharp slowdown in the U.K. economy in the first quarter of 2017 when the economy expanded at a quarterly rate of 0.2%, less than half of the speed recorded in last year\u2019s final quarter", "news_time": "2017-07-07 10:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-election-u-k-sees-possible-signs-of-softer-brexit-approach-1499438671", "news_title": "After Election, U.K. Sees Possible Signs of Softer Brexit Approach ", "keywords": "brexit,u.k.-eu relations,u.k. politics,European Union,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "AMANDA NUNES arrives by skateboard for her first training session of the day, smiling and sweating lightly in denim cutoffs and a ripped T-shirt. The UFC women\u2019s bantamweight champion seems genuinely thrilled to see every person she encounters inside American Top Team, a mixed martial arts gym in Coconut Creek, Fla., about 20 miles north of Fort Lauderdale. The 40,000-square-foot space looks like a warehouse and feels like a sauna thanks to dozens of overheated fighters who hit bags and pads, grapple on the mats and spar inside the octagon.\u201cI like it loud when I train,\u201d Nunes says over the din of classic rock and shouting coaches. \u201cLoud like a real fight. Like the arena.\u201dA man is headed for the exit of the sprawling complex when he spots Nunes, 28, who\u2019s carefully wrapping her hands behind the bleachers. \u201cHey, champ,\u201d he says, clearly star-struck. He introduces Nunes to his sons. \u201cThis,\u201d he tells them, \u201cis who you saw beat the crap out of Ronda Rousey.\u201dIt is a useful reminder. Nunes, who spent a full minute high-fiving a baby on her way into the gym, was vicious, relentless and laser-focused when she faced former UFC champion Ronda Rousey on Dec. 30, 2016. In the first 48 seconds of the fight, Nunes landed 27 strikes that left Rousey clinging to the cage and to consciousness. The referee jumped in to stop the action and declare a win by technical knockout. Nunes, stone-faced and unscathed, raised a finger to her lips and circled the octagon, glaring menacingly at the crowd.Nunes vs. Rousey had been scheduled for five five-minute rounds, standard length for a title bout in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which is the NFL of mixed martial arts. The image of Rousey after her 48-second defeat\u2014dazed, unsteady, blood streaming from both nostrils\u2014underscores the violence of the sport, which combines techniques from boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, judo and jujitsu. The term \u201cmixed martial arts\u201d was first used to describe UFC 1, which took place in Denver in 1993. The eight-man, winner-takes-all tournament featured no judges, no weight classes and no time limits, timeouts or rounds. Biting and eye gouging were forbidden; everything else was fair play. Today, fighters wear gloves, submit regular blood and urine samples to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and (for the most part) avoid throat strikes, kidney kicks, hair pulling and 28 other fouls.Commercially speaking, the sport has come a long way from its scrappy, outlaw beginnings. In May, 2016, New York state lifted a nearly 20-year ban on mixed martial arts; six months later, the UFC held its first event at Madison Square Garden, where it generated a record-breaking $17.7 million in gate revenues. Last July the UFC\u2014purchased for $2 million in 2001 by billionaire brothers Frank and       Lorenzo Fertitta      \u2014sold to the talent agency WME-IMG for a reported $4 billion. And on Aug. 26, UFC star Conor McGreogor will face undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather in a boxing match that is expected to break the record for most pay-per-view buys in history.In the early days, fighters clashed to test their specialties\u2014sumo wrestling vs. kickboxing, boxing vs. Brazilian jujitsu\u2014but the era of the one-trick pony is long gone. McGregor has a favorite saying on the subject: \u201cI don\u2019t look at a man who\u2019s expert in one area as a specialist. I look at him as a rookie in 10 other areas.\u201dNunes holds a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu and is widely considered the hardest puncher in the women\u2019s division, meaning she\u2019s a world-class grappler and submission artist on the ground and even more dangerous on her feet. She epitomizes the new breed of UFC champion, exhibiting mastery of at least one discipline, high-level proficiency in most others and the ability\u2014and appetite\u2014to evolve.With her smashing victory over Rousey (UFC commentator Joe Rogan described it as \u201cthe least competitive main event\u201d he has ever seen) Nunes cemented her status as the best bantamweight in the world. Now is not the time to coast. \u201cYou hear this clich\u00e9 all the time,\u201d says UFC President Dana White, \u201cbut it\u2019s a lot harder to stay on top than it is to get there.\u201d For proof, look no further than the title Nunes holds. Its first owner was Rousey, the UFC\u2019s first real superstar, who tore through six consecutive challengers, finishing four of them in under a minute. Journalists joked that she\u2019d have to fight men. Then in November of 2015, Rousey faced Holly Holm\u2014a 6:1 underdog going into the fight\u2014who snapped the champion\u2019s undefeated streak with a barrage of punches punctuated by a perfectly timed kick to the head.For the next 18 months, the belt changed hands as quickly as the UFC could schedule title fights. Holm was defeated by Miesha Tate, put to sleep in the final seconds of the fight with a choke applied from the back, the same choke Nunes used to submit Tate and claim the belt in July 2016. When Nunes decimated Rousey in December, she became the first woman since Rousey to successfully defend the belt.On July 8, she faces Valentina Shevchenko for the second time in her career. \u201cDefinitely my toughest opponent,\u201d Nunes says of the 29-year-old Russian fighter whom she defeated by judge\u2019s decision last March. Shevchenko is on a two-fight winning streak. And this time there is a title on the line.How does a fighter rise to the top in an unforgiving, unpredictable sport\u2014and then stay there? In the case of Amanda Nunes, it takes a gym the size of a village.She was born in Pojuca, a tiny town near Salvador, the capitol city of Bahia, Brazil. Her mother boxed; her uncle competed in vale tudo\u2014literally \u201canything goes\u201d in Portuguese\u2014a no-holds-barred Brazilian combat sport and precursor to the modern MMA. Nunes studied Brazilian jujitsu as a teenager and made her professional debut in 2008 at the age of 19. She came to America in 2010 with, she says, $20 to her name. She arrived at American Top Team in 2014, fresh off her first loss in the UFC.\u201cI knew I had to make some changes,\u201d Nunes says. \u201cAnd I knew if I stepped in this gym I would become a champion.\u201d Her faith in the program is well founded; American Top Team is home to three current UFC champions, three times more than any other gym. \u201cOne of the best in the world, period,\u201d White says of ATT.Nunes trains here at least twice a day, six days a week. She works with striking coaches, grappling and wrestling coaches, strength and conditioning coaches, and coaches assigned specially to fine-tune all aspects of her game.The well-staffed MMA mega-gym (American Top Team has sleeping accommodations, day care and an organic juice bar) is a byproduct of the money that has poured into MMA over the past decade. According to Dana White, the caliber of competitor in MMA has risen in lockstep with the salaries. \u201cOnce money started coming into this sport,\u201d he says, \u201cyou saw real athletes\u2014people who would have played other sports\u2014becoming mixed martial artists and professional fighters. And then the piece that I never saw coming, that has truly blown my mind and continues to blow my mind, is the evolution of women in the sport.\u201d This isn\u2019t the false modesty of a seasoned promoter. In 2011, a reporter from TMZ asked White when fans could expect to see women in the UFC. His reply: \u201cNever.\u201dFour years later, Ronda Rousey was the most dominant fighter in the UFC, one of the highest paid women in any sport, and among the most recognizable athletes in the world. Rousey was a specialist; nine of her 12 career victories came by arm bar\u2014a submission technique in which she used her Olympic-level judo to get her opponent to the ground and hyperextend her elbow. Her losses to Holm and Nunes highlighted her failure to evolve as a boxer or striker, a fatal mistake in a division of increasingly well-rounded women.\u201cThe game is always changing,\u201d says Mike Brown, a former World Extreme Cage Fighting champion and now a coach at ATT. \u201cYou can\u2019t be stagnant in any area. You always have to be adding new techniques, new movements, new styles. This is Darwinism at its finest, you know? Evolve or be eaten.\u201dNunes spends the morning inside the octagon with Brown and her primary training partner, UFC fighter Nina Ansaroff. The two women clinch up against the fence, and take turns pinning each other\u2019s wrists, slipping punches and blocking knees to the body\u2014a mix of close-range striking and grappling designed specifically for a fight inside a chain-link cage. Brown, a former collegiate wrestler, offers up constructive and possibly metaphorical criticism: \u201cLook up, Amanda,\u201d he says at one point, unhappy with Nunes\u2019s posture and body extension as she threw Ansaroff to the ground. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to look down, ever. If we look down, we go down.\u201dNunes and Ansaroff recently closed on a three-bedroom house in the nearby town of Coral Springs, an upgrade from their one-bedroom condo they share in a mazelike white stucco complex less than a mile from the gym. They head home together for lunch; Ansaroff prepares scrambled eggs and pasta with chicken sausage, fuel for their afternoon striking session. The two women have been a couple for four years, which makes Nunes the first and only openly gay champion in combat sports. Both women have complicated feelings about the attention that distinction has received.\u201cThey promoted that more than they promoted her being the first female Brazilian champion,\u201d Ansaroff tells me. Nunes nods vigorously. \u201cI\u2019m not into that,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not that kind of person.\u201d There are, of course, advantages to sharing your life with your primary training partner. \u201cWhen we get in an argument,\u201d Nunes says, \u201cwe grab our gloves and then go to the gym. We punch each other in the face and then everything\u2019s cool.\u201dNunes gets a slow start the next day, and shows up for a conditioning session at the crack of 11:25 a.m. For an American Top Team fighter with a confirmed opponent, strength training is hyperspecific, focused on the muscles necessary to execute a strategy developed by coaches and scouts after extensive oppo research. The strategy for Nunes\u2019s upcoming fight isn\u2019t discussed around reporters, but the strategy for her last fight was simple: neutralize Rousey\u2019s signature arm bar. For Rousey to lock in the submission, she had to get Nunes to the ground.\u201cWe were expecting Rousey to get close to Amanda, to try to take her down,\u201d says Everton Oliveira, strength and conditioning coach at ATT. \u201cSo we worked on her upper body and core strength. I wanted to make sure Rousey couldn\u2019t keep her in the clinch.\u201d True to form, Rousey attempted to clinch up twice in 48 seconds. Both times, Nunes shrugged her off like loose clothing and punched her in the face.Her final session of the day is a jujitsu master class with Marcus \u201cConan\u201d Silveira, a co-founder of American Top Team and the gym\u2019s head coach. With his heavy and heavily tattooed 6-foot-3 frame, Silveira is more imposing than any Hollywood version of the barbarian he\u2019s nicknamed for. He has been involved in the sport since its vale-tudo days back in Brazil where he studied jujitsu under Carlson Gracie, a legend of the sport.It was Gracie, Silveira says, who taught him the mind-set he instills in his fighters today. \u201cHe always told me: \u2018It\u2019s not enough that you\u2019re a black belt in jujitsu. You gotta be a complete fighter, you gotta do everything.\u2019 The vision that he had for MMA was 30 years ahead of everybody.\u201dIn a private and well-padded room, Silveira coaches Nunes and Ansaroff on what\u2019s known in jujitsu as \u201ctaking the back,\u201d a position in which a fighter wraps her arms and legs around an opponent from behind and becomes a kind of human backpack. Nunes almost submitted Shevchenko with a choke from the back in their first fight, but an error in body positioning allowed the Russian to slip out and establish top position, and Nunes ate a few hard shots to the head before being saved by the bell. Silveira seems determined not to let that happen again, working out the finer points of Nunes\u2019s execution until she\u2019s able to take the back and lock in a choke in one smooth motion. According to Silveira, it\u2019s is the sum of these small, opponent-specific adjustments that lead to victory in the octagon. \u201cIt is a fighting science,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a fighter, you have to be able to mold yourself like Play-Doh.\u201dIn the midst of all this granular shape-shifting, it\u2019s important for a fighter to keep the big picture in their sights, something ATT assistant coach Din Thomas stressed at the end of his striking session with Nunes the day before.\u201cWe\u2019re gonna train right,\u201d Thomas said as Nunes stood in front of him with sweat pouring down her face. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna train smart. We\u2019re gonna train hard. We\u2019re not gonna kill ourselves. We\u2019re gonna clock in, put them hours in, go home, party. Clock in, put them hours in, go home, party.

But the payment has been delayed for a few days because Greece had to implement some pending bailout conditions.\u201cToday\u2019s decision by the [European Stability Mechanism] board of directors shows that Greece has completed the reforms required at this stage,\u201d its managing director       Klaus Regling       said in a written statement.Greece is facing some \u20ac6.9 billion payments in the next few weeks to the European Central Bank, private bondholders and the International Monetary Fund. Some \u20ac800 million will also be made available to the Greek government for the repayment of state arrears to suppliers and taxpayers.Another \u20ac800 million will be released for the same purpose in fall \u201csubject to Greece making significant progress on arrears clearance, using its own resources to the arrears clearance effort as well as the funding from the disbursement approved today,\u201d the ESM said in a statement.During the last Eurogroup, the country\u2019s creditors outlined options for some minimum debt relief they will offer Greece after the end of its current bailout in August 2018, but put off a final decision that would make the country\u2019s crushing debt sustainable.The International Monetary Fund agreed to support the deal but only in principle, until the European creditors commit to substantial debt relief. The European Central Bank also said that the measures sketched by Europe don\u2019t offer enough clarity for the institution to include Greece in its bond-buying program.Despite the lack of clarity on the debt deal, the Greek government is weighing its options regarding a return to bond markets.

But other officials suggest that the government should wait until autumn, or even until early 2018 after completing another year of achieving its fiscal targets.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go too early but\u2026when we do go we want to ensure that markets know that this is part of a strategy,\u201d Greece\u2019s Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said last week.Greece should have gained market access and be able to finance itself before its current bailout ends to avoid another loan agreement.Write to Nektaria Stamouli at nektaria.stamouli@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 10:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-to-get-its-latest-big-tranche-by-eu-creditors-1499438533", "news_title": "Greece to Get Its Latest Big Tranche by EU Creditors", "keywords": "regulation,government policy,government aid,corporate,industrial news,government finance,government borrowing,euro zone,currency,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "As the saying goes, old dogs\u2014or mice or monkeys or people\u2014can\u2019t learn new tricks. But why? Neuroscientists have started to unravel the brain changes that are responsible. And as a new paper in the journal Science shows, they can even use these research findings to reverse the process. Old mice, at least, really can go back to learning like young ones.The new study builds on classic work done by Michael Merzenich at the University of California, San Francisco, and colleagues. In the early 2000s they recorded the electrical activity in brain cells and discovered that young animals\u2019 brains would change systematically when they repeatedly heard something new. For instance, if a baby monkey heard a new sound pattern many times, her neurons (brain cells) would adjust to respond more to that sound pattern. Older monkeys\u2019 neurons didn\u2019t change in the same way.At least part of the reason for this lies in neurotransmitters, chemicals that help to connect one neuron to another. Young animals have high levels of \u201ccholinergic\u201d neurotransmitters that make the brain more plastic, easier to change. Older animals start to produce inhibitory chemicals that counteract the effect of the cholinergic ones. They actually actively keep the brain from changing.So an adult brain not only loses its flexibility but suppresses it. This process may reflect the different agendas of adults and children. Children explore; adults exploit.From an evolutionary perspective, childhood is an adaptation designed to let animals learn. Baby animals get a protected time when all they have to do is learn, without worrying about actually making things happen or getting things done. Adults are more focused on using what they already know to act effectively and quickly. Inhibitory chemicals may help in this process. Nature often works according to the maxim, \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d In this case, there\u2019s no need to change a brain that\u2019s already working well.In the new research, Jay Blundon and colleagues at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., tried to restore early-learning abilities to adult mice. As in the earlier experiments, they exposed the mice to a new sound and recorded whether their neurons changed in response. But this time the researchers tried making the adult mice more flexible by keeping the inhibitory brain chemicals from influencing the neurons.In some studies, they actually changed the mouse genes so that the animals no longer produced the inhibitors in the same way. In others, they injected other chemicals that counteracted the inhibitors. (Caffeine seems to work in this way, by counteracting inhibitory neurotransmitters. That\u2019s why coffee makes us more alert and helps us to learn.)In all of these cases in the St. Jude study, the adult brains started to look like the baby brains. When the researchers exposed the altered adult mice to a new sound, their neurons responded differently, like babies\u2019 neurons. The mice got better at discriminating among the sounds, too. The researchers also reversed the process, by getting young brains to produce the inhibitory chemicals\u2014and the baby mice started acting like the adults.The researchers suggest that these results may help in some disorders that come with aging. But should we all try to have childlike brains, perpetually sensitive to anything new? Maybe not, or at least not all of the time. There may be a tension between learning and acting, and adult brain chemistry may help us to focus and ignore distractions.Babies of any species are surrounded by a new world, and their brain chemistry reflects that. Being a baby is like discovering love on your first visit to Paris after three double espressos. It\u2019s a great way to be in some ways, but you might wake up crying at 3 in the morning.

For what seemed like the millionth time, my 8-year-old son, Nick, had left his new bike by the front door instead of putting it away. Just the day before, I\u2019d snapped at him: \u201cYou need to put your bike where it belongs. I\u2019m getting tired of reminding you!\u201d Smiling and happy to see me just a moment before, he now looked downcast. I felt like a horrible parent.Why do we zoom in on our children\u2019s faults and find it so hard to resist the urge to criticize?Blame it on our brains. Our \u201cnegativity bias,\u201d an ancient survival mechanism, hard-wires us to be nit-pickers, focusing on what\u2019s wrong as a way to keep ourselves and our tribe safe. These days, we\u2019re also under social pressure to \u201cfix\u201d what\u2019s missing or lacking in our kids with extra tutoring, discipline strategies, therapy and more.The good news is that by learning how to shift our focus to our child\u2019s strengths, we can override the negativity bias. A strength is more than just something your child is good at. Psychologists define a strength as something your child does well, happily and often, and they have identified more than 100 discrete strengths that can be measured and improved. These range from talents in sports, music, art and communication to character traits such as grit, curiosity, courage, humor and kindness.Research has shown that focusing on strengths encourages children to be happy and active. A 2009 study of more than 300 middle-school students in the U.S., published in the Oxford Review of Education, found that teens who undertook 25 lessons on strengths\u2014including taking a survey to identify their own strengths and setting goals to use their strengths in new ways\u2014had significantly higher engagement and enjoyment at school (as reported by the students themselves). They also had better social skills (as reported by teachers and parents) than their peers who didn\u2019t go through the program. Similar results have been found for students in the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Japan and China.In my own research, children and teenagers with parents who focus on strengths are less stressed and better at handling friendship issues and meeting homework deadlines. They also get better grades. Parents benefit, too. In one of my studies, published this year in the International Journal of Applied Positive Psychology, 137 parents were split into two groups. One took a three-week course that taught them to focus on their children\u2019s strengths, while a control group continued to parent as usual. Those who went through the training were happier and more confident about their parenting skills after the course compared with their pre-course levels. Those who didn\u2019t go through the course showed no shift in happiness and confidence.Focusing on strengths doesn\u2019t mean ignoring problems or lavishing children with excessive praise. It shows them how to use what they\u2019re good at to work on what they\u2019re not so good at. To shift gears, just choose a strength your child already has and suggest how he or she could use it to handle the situation.In my case, I remembered Nick\u2019s good organizational skills. I commented on how he\u2019d used them to put his other belongings away after school. I asked him to use those skills now and in the future to put his bike where it belonged. Result? He felt good about himself\u2014and I got the bike put away. A father I\u2019ve worked with helped his athletic son channel his natural competitive spirit into a friendly contest to \u201cwin\u201d at finishing homework instead of having the same old battle about lack of discipline.How to start? Simply notice one strength in your child each week and have a conversation together about it. When challenges arise, you will find that you can more easily shift out of fix-it mode and into strength focus.Also, incorporate strengths into the questions you ask your children. When your child is nervous about a big project or event coming up, ask him or her, \u201cWhat strengths do you have to help you with this?\u201d If they have had a fight with a friend: \u201cWhat strengths do you think were missing that may have led to the fight? What strengths will help you make up?\u201dNegativity bias helps us to survive, but our strengths help us to thrive. Showing our children how to harness them is the best tool for success that we can give them.\u2014Dr. Waters is a professor of positive psychology at the University of Melbourne and author of \u201cThe Strength Switch,\u201d to be published by Avery on July 11.Appeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'THE POWER OF POSITIVE PARENTING.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 10:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-power-of-positive-parenting-1499437992", "news_title": "The Power of Positive Parenting", "keywords": "more on parenting, parenting,parenting advice,parenting tips,parents,political,general news,living,lifestyle,parenting"}, {"content": "OTTAWA\u2014Employment in Canada surged for a second-consecutive month in June and the unemployment rate fell, capping off the best quarter of job creation in seven years and setting the stage for a widely anticipated interest-rate increase next week from the Bank of Canada.The Canadian economy added a net 45,300 jobs in June, Statistics Canada said Friday. Market expectations were for a gain of 10,000 positions, according to economists at             Royal Bank of Canada.On a year-over-year basis, Canadian employment increased 350,800, or 1.9%, which marks the fastest annual rise in job growth since February 2013. Over two-thirds of the new jobs created over the past 12 months were full-time positions.For the second quarter, employment rose 103,000, representing the biggest quarterly increase since 2010.Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to 6.5% in June from the previous month\u2019s 6.6% level. When using U.S. Labor Department methodology, Canada\u2019s jobless rate in June was 5.4%.Financial markets responded positively to the labor data. The Canadian dollar shot higher, touching a fresh 10-month high. The U.S. dollar was trading recently at C$1.2896 from C$1.2973 right before the release of the report and C$1.2977 late Thursday, according to data provider CQG.Meanwhile, Canadian bonds continued to sell off, as the jobs report gave investors more confidence about an imminent Bank of Canada rate increase. The two-year bond was yielding 1.154% from 1.139% late Thursday, while the 10-year bond was yielding 1.869% from 1.833%, according to CanDeal. Bond prices move inversely to yields.The U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for June, released at the same time, showed the creation of 222,000 jobs from the prior month. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% from 4.3% the prior month as more people joined the workforce, the U.S. Labor Department said Friday.Canada\u2019s June report, following a 54,500 employment gain in the previous month, will likely reinforce already heightened expectations for a Bank of Canada rate rise on Wednesday\u2014the first increase in the central bank\u2019s benchmark lending rate in seven years. The rate rise would come amid signs of a firming economy following a prolonged slump fueled by the commodity-price shock that began in mid-2014.Gross domestic product rose at a 3.7% annualized rate in the first quarter, making Canada the best-performing economy among Group of Seven countries in early 2017, and it is on track for second-quarter expansion of roughly 2.5%.A quarterly survey of firms conducted by the Bank of Canada and released last week indicated executives expect sales prospects to improve over the 12 months, while hiring intentions hit a record level with two-thirds of firms signaling an increase in payrolls in one year\u2019s time.\u201cIn sum, the jobs market is tightening, and not that far from what historically has been judged as full employment,\u201d said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets. He said the jobs report \u201ccements the case\u201d for a Bank of Canada rate rise on Wednesday.The one drawback in the jobs report is wage growth. Average hourly pay rose 1.3% from a year ago in June, data showed, matching the annual advance recorded in the previous month. The Bank of Canada has cited subdued wage growth as a source of concern.Meanwhile, the bulk of the net new jobs created in June were part-time, 37,100, versus the addition of 8,100 full-time positions. In the April-to-June period, just over half the jobs added were full time, which tend to pay higher wages and provide better benefits compared with part-time positions.Firms and organizations added 23,900 workers in June, while the ranks of the self-employed\u2014generally independent contractors\u2014rose 21,400.On a sectoral basis, the goods-producing component of the economy added 16,000 net new jobs, while the services sector created 29,200 positions.\u2014David George-Cosh contributed to this article.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 10:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-creates-45-300-jobs-in-june-1499433506", "news_title": "Canada Creates 45,300 Jobs in June", "keywords": " bank of canada, canada economy,canada jobs, employment, interest rates, job creation, jobs report, rate increase, unemployment,U.S. Labor Department,Bank of Canada,Statistics Canada,economic performance,indicators,employment,unemployment,monetary policy,economic news"}, {"content": "As chief executive of BTR PLC, Owen Green established himself in the 1980s as one of Britain\u2019s most admired corporate leaders by taking over poorly performing companies and knocking them into shape.Once known as British Tyre & Rubber, BTR thrived on acquisitions, mostly in unglamorous industries. Its products included airplane brakes, golf balls, construction materials, artificial limbs and pantyhose. Mr. Green kept his London head office small and let managers of the many subsidiaries run their own shows so long as they met strict profit targets.In the 1990s, Mr. Green publicly denounced what he saw as greed among corporate executives. \u201cHow a director who has just had an 18% rise dares tell his workers to show restraint and accept less than 5%, I cannot understand,\u201d he wrote. Executives were often mere functionaries and shouldn\u2019t be rewarded like entrepreneurs or show business stars, he argued.BTR didn\u2019t survive long after his retirement in 1993. Conglomerates were losing favor on the stock market, and it was becoming harder to find undervalued bid targets. BTR agreed to merge with Siebe PLC in 1998, creating Invensys PLC, which focused on industrial automation and was later swallowed by             Schneider Electric SA       of France.Mr. Green died June 1 at age 92 after a brief illness.In a 1992 interview with The Wall Street Journal, he said U.S. executive pay had soared \u201cout of any proportion\u201d with what one person could contribute to running a large organization. \u201cThe laborer is worthy of his hire, but no more than that,\u201d Mr. Green said, adding that he believed some American executives regarded soaring pay as proof of their virility.A year later, he said in another interview: \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing to be said against entrepreneurs or pop stars creating personal wealth through their own talent. But in many large companies the people at the top are really a type of functionary; the culture and the strategy are already set.\u201dIn 1993, his final year as chairman of BTR, Mr. Green earned a salary of \u00a3217,616 ($281,000 at the current exchange rate), low by British standards of the time.Two of his most celebrated deals were takeovers of Thomas Tilling PLC and Dunlop Holdings PLC in the mid-1980s. In both cases, BTR shed the fancy head offices of the acquired companies and stuck with its more pedestrian headquarters near London\u2019s Victoria train station. BTR also sold the             Rolls-Royce                   formerly used to whisk Dunlop grandees around London.In 1987, BTR walked away from a bid for Pilkington Brothers PLC when a profit forecast by the glassmaker raised the market price beyond what Mr. Green considered prudent. He dismissed suggestions at the time that the retreat signaled the end of BTR\u2019s glory days. \u201cThe dogs may bark, but the caravan rolls on,\u201d he told the Sunday Times of London.Owen Whitley Green was born in Stockton-on-Tees, England, on May 14, 1925, and worked as an accountant before joining BTR in 1956.Mr. Green\u2019s survivors include three children.He once listed his hobbies as \u201cbad golf and good reading.\u201dWrite to James R.

Tylee Wilson, chief executive of R.J. Reynolds Industries Inc., aimed to transform the cigarette company into a packaged-foods powerhouse when he agreed in 1985 to buy Nabisco Brands Inc. for $4.9 billion. The deal reduced the company\u2019s dependence on cigarettes and reeled in such brands as Ritz crackers and Oreo cookies.It also brought heartache. Mr. Wilson lost his job within 18 months as Ross Johnson, Nabisco\u2019s former chief, grabbed the controls. Then Mr. Wilson watched as the new RJR Nabisco spiraled into the 1988 bidding war that became a parable of corporate greed, inspiring the book and movie \u201cBarbarians at the Gate.\u201dThe 6-foot-2 Mr. Wilson, a Camel smoker who favored three-piece suits, was used to overseeing a global business including tobacco, alcohol and Del Monte fruit. Retired from RJR Nabisco in his late 50s, he settled into a quieter life of consulting, serving on boards and running a marina.Mr. Wilson died June 21 at home in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. He was 86.James Tylee Wilson, often called Ty, was born June 18, 1931, and grew up in Teaneck, N.J. His father was a sales manager at a textile company. The younger Mr. Wilson earned a degree in government at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., and later said his studies there taught him how to think. He was a member of the Reserve Officer Training Corps and later served as a weapons instructor in the Army.One of his early jobs was installing toilet-paper dispensers at gas stations. He moved on to             Procter & Gamble Co.       and then Chesebrough-Pond\u2019s Inc. As a rising young executive at that maker of health and beauty products, he met Patricia Harrington, who worked in an airport passenger lounge in New York. He began sending her occasional \u201ccare packages\u201d of lotions from Chesebrough-Pond\u2019s. They married in 1970.Mr. Wilson joined Reynolds, the maker of Camel and Winston cigarettes, in 1974 and was named CEO, after a succession battle, in 1983. He reconfigured the company by selling oil and ocean-shipping businesses and investing in more-efficient cigarette plants.\u201cI put my business first in my life, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d he said in a 1985 interview with the             New York Times.       \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean my family takes a back seat or that I don\u2019t take care of them. It just means that if my wife has a bad cold, I\u2019m going to leave town. If she has to have her appendix out, I\u2019ll stay.\u201dThough worries about the dangers of smoking were growing, Mr. Wilson said in that 1985 interview that there was \u201cnot any scientific evidence that elements contained in tobacco smoke cause disease in humans\u2014period.\u201dIn any case, Reynolds and other tobacco companies were eager to keep diversifying. After Reynolds bought Nabisco, Mr. Johnson became president. Mr. Wilson was expected to serve as CEO of the combined RJR Nabisco for at least a couple of years before handing the reins to Mr. Johnson. \u201cI\u2019d like to run it for a while,\u201d Mr. Wilson told the Times. \u201cI sure would.\u201dWithin a year, though, some of the directors were annoyed that Mr. Wilson didn\u2019t brief them on plans for a safer \u201csmokeless\u201d cigarette (which later flopped). Meanwhile, Mr. Johnson told directors he was thinking of leaving RJR, according to \u201cBarbarians at the Gate\u201d by former Wall Street Journal reporters Bryan Burrough and John Helyar. The board, eager to keep Mr. Johnson, made him CEO, sending Mr. Wilson into an early retirement.Mr. Johnson tried to take RJR Nabisco private with a leveraged buyout in October 1988. Rival bids came in from             Kohlberg Kravis Roberts                   & Co., or KKR, and a group led by First Boston Corp.\u00a0First Boston sought advice from Mr. Wilson during the battle, and there were suggestions he might return as CEO; that didn\u2019t happen. RJR Nabisco\u2019s board ended up accepting a $25.07 billion bid from KKR.During his retirement years, Mr. Wilson provided advice and donations to health-care organizations. He enjoyed fishing and named his boat Integrity. For a few years, he owned and managed a marina in Jacksonville, Fla. At Wake Forest University, he provided funding for the J.

With excellent timing, she agreed to sell the firm in 1999 when demand for luxury brands was hot.Ms. Fendi became the president of the company founded as a maker of leather goods in the mid-1920s by her parents, Adele and Edoardo Fendi. The Fendi firm hired Karl Lagerfeld as a designer in the mid-1960s. He made furs a fashion sensation again by dyeing them in bright colors and trimming them into whimsical patterns, attracting customers including Jacqueline Kennedy and Sophia Loren.In the 1990s, Fendi came up with another huge seller: the Baguette bag, a purse shaped like French bread and featured in the television series \u201cSex and the City.\u201dA bidding war for Fendi erupted in 1999. France\u2019s LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA teamed up with Prada Holding BV to outbid Gucci Group NV for a 51% stake in Fendi.

Thumbprints and Italian butterballs are her specialty. The bride\u2019s Palestinian father drove to Dearborn, Mich., to pick up 500 Middle Eastern sweets. Ms. Creatore borrowed neighbors\u2019 freezer space and needed three pickup trucks and three cars to collect and deliver cookies to the hall the night before the wedding.\u201cMy goal was to have a spectacular cookie table for him,\u201d says Ms. Creatore, who began serious cookie planning eight months before the wedding, which had 360 guests.She made 4,000 of the cookie total, inviting friends over for nights of wine and dough rolling. They burned batches and moaned. It was a labor of love, she says.While some people rate wedding receptions on music, venue and dinner, in certain pockets of the country, it is the size and quality of the cookie table.\u201cThere is a lot of \u2018Mine is bigger than yours,\u2019\u201d says Michal Naffah, owner of the Embassy Banquet Centre, a Youngstown-area reception hall. When his daughter, Mallory, married in 2015, Mr. Naffah recalled \u201cwe had tens of thousands of cookies,\u201d filling nine banquet tables. Six people worked for two days on the display. They also served cake.Don Warg assumes every reception at Mr. Anthony\u2019s Banquet Center, the Youngstown-area hall where he is assistant manager, will have a cookie table. One recent Saturday, when they had two 6 p.m. receptions, staff had to begin at about 11 a.m. to get the cookies out in time.These days, couples looking to add something different to their receptions are trying non-wedding-cake options, ordering tarts, doughnuts, pies and parfaits, brownies and blondies. S\u2019mores bars are big, too.The appeal of the cookie table is that it is a tradition handed down through generations\u2014at least in areas such as Youngstown and Pittsburgh, which both claim to be its birthplace. As children grow up and move on, the idea has spread. Cookie tables have been reported in 17 states and Canada, according to the Mahoning Valley Historical Society in Youngstown and postings on the Youngstown Cookie Table             Facebook                   page.There is an emotional connection for some. Mothers of the brides had cookie tables at their weddings, with pizzelles and nut horns made by teams of aunts and great-aunts. But it isn\u2019t carefree.Buckeyes, while delicious, are tedious. Powdered sugar sweats. Cheesecake cracks. Having been to weddings where everyone noticed a skimpy cookie table, brides-to-be worry about running out. Some couples may not want a cookie table, but feel pressured because it is a family ritual.Its origins are unclear, whether it was brought over by Italian or Eastern European immigrants or originated in the U.S. during the Depression. Families couldn\u2019t afford wedding cakes and made their best, most delicate pastries instead, with neighbors pitching in, says Jacqueline Marino, co-editor of Car Bombs to Cookie Tables, a book of essays about Youngstown. For her wedding, Ms. Marino learned to make apple strudel, using a recipe from an old Slovak cookbook, which belonged to her husband\u2019s great-aunt.Mary Beth McKnight Potts, of Youngstown, loaded about 3,000 cookies in coolers destined for her niece\u2019s 2015 wedding in North Carolina. She went to a charity event and snatched up more than a dozen estate crystal platters to display the cookies. She baked eight varieties, including pecan tarts, her specialty. She can fill 16 pecan-tart pans while watching the evening news.Ms. Potts, a seasoned baker, is often asked to help with cookie tables and will interview the couple beforehand. \u201cWhat do you want this cookie table to say? Where do you want the \u2018Wow\u2019 factor?\u201d On the cookies or the cake or, in the case of a cousin\u2019s wedding, on the Harry Potter-themed selection of candies?She posts recipes on the Youngstown Cookie Table Facebook page, which has more than 4,500 members around the country. Cookie tables have shown up at weddings in Florida, Arizona and Texas. Linda Sproul, who created the page in 2009, has since moved to Missouri but remains its administrator to screen members. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it be commercialized, or too exclusive,\u201d she says.They post photos and recipes and discuss cookie-to-guest ratios, 12-to-1 being the consensus if you want guests to take some home, which most agree you do and suggest decorative bags or Chinese takeout containers. They ask what cookies freeze well and whether the proper name of the Eastern European pastry is kolache, or kolachi, and best filled with nuts or cheese or apricot preserves.Another question is when to open cookie tables, says planner Anna Serrano, of Your Event, Your Way in Youngstown. When guests arrive, or after dinner? Do you drape tulle over them so people can see but not touch, or keep them in a separate room for a big reveal? \u201cWhatever the client wants, I try to make happen,\u201d she says.Newer cookies like vegan chocolate, rosemary shortbread and Twix cookies are showing up on tables, says Johnna Pro, who organized the Traditional Pittsburgh Wedding Cookie Table when the city hosted the National Main Street Now Conference this spring. There were 319 dozen cookies in 39 varieties, says Ms. Pro, who works for the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development.She usually makes 10 dozen lady locks for weddings, which she learned to make from her Italian mother, but only a few dozen Pesche Con Crema, special cookies that look like peaches.

Informed by stinging lessons from the slow-moving health policy debate and animated by the partywide desire for legislative victories before the 2018 election, they have emerged from their occasional private meetings and steady staff work with vague but consistent optimism.The group is composed of two lawmakers with their own tax plan, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady; two veterans of Washington political warfare, Sens.       Mitch McConnell       and       Orrin Hatch      ; and two Trump administration representatives more schooled in the ways of Wall Street than Washington, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director       Gary Cohn.The idea is that each member\u2014knowing what his side can tolerate\u2014will sign off on the same detailed framework in September so Republicans can complete the major tax legislation they have campaigned on but haven\u2019t written yet.\u201cSometimes, you get in these discussions where it isn\u2019t clear that all the parties are in for the mission. They\u2019re all in,\u201d said a person familiar with the private talks. \u201cThey have a good keen sense of the price of walking away.\u201dThe group meets regularly with a small group of aides, typically in the second-floor Capitol offices of Mr. Ryan or Mr. McConnell. People familiar with the meetings describe them as unusually collaborative so far, dominated more by a collective desire to get a deal than by one or two voices. In a photo released last month by Mr. Ryan, five of the six are shown around a conference table in the speaker\u2019s suite, grinning and chuckling as aides seated along a wall laugh, too.The group is working its way up to the hardest decisions, trying to make choices on key policy questions and hoping to release a framework in September that is more detailed than the administration\u2019s one-page April outline. Congress would then write legislation over the following months.The process is shaped by the divisions that emerged on health care. This time around, the goal is to get the Senate, the House and the White House on the same page up front.So far, the high-powered group hasn\u2019t engaged in the leaking and backbiting that often accompany fiscal negotiations. But it isn\u2019t clear whether that is a sign of progress or an indication they haven\u2019t yet tackled the toughest political and policy trade-offs. Participants have emphasized that they aren\u2019t excluding other voices but are representing them in the room. And they have said rank-and-file lawmakers will get to weigh in and write the actual bill.\u201cWhile this process may result in an agreed-upon framework, this will not be the be-all, end-all of tax reform,\u201d Mr. Hatch said on the Senate floor last month. \u201cThe idea that tax reform is going to be a closed-door exercise is absurd.\u201dThe self-imposed September goal is ambitious. They are trying to avoid having the issue bleed into a campaign year, when lawmakers\u2019 thoughts turn to parades and primaries and away from controversial votes.\u201cI don\u2019t think that the window closes if we slip into next year, but obviously this year is better,\u201d said a senior White House official.Messrs. Ryan and Brady have been living tax policy for years, their views weathered by dead ends they have explored.\u201cWe\u2019ve run down a lot of traps, not just in policy but with our members as well and the business community,\u201d Mr. Brady said.Their June 2016 blueprint is the most detailed tax plan available, and it has been the focus of tax lobbyists and lawmakers. But it is full of controversies, including a border-adjustment proposal to tax imports and exempt exports and a plan to prevent businesses from deducting interest on their debt.The senators need to corral lawmakers in their chamber who have been discussing tax policy\u2014and griping about the House blueprint\u2014but lack their own plan. Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Cohn are giving President Donald Trump regular updates on the talks. They bring business-world experience but have never maneuvered a major piece of legislation through Congress.The six participants have agreed not to talk publicly about their conversations, but the tough choices they face are now obvious.\u2022If the Senate and White House can\u2019t accept Mr. Brady\u2019s controversial border adjustment, which would raise $1 trillion over a decade, how do they pay for corporate tax rate cuts and prevent U.S. companies from shifting more profits abroad? Messrs. Ryan and Brady moved to border adjustment after other ideas failed, but it lacks political support and no clear alternative has emerged.\u2022How can they reconcile conflicts between the administration\u2019s frequent desire for large tax cuts and the insistence from some on the congressional side for a bill that doesn\u2019t increase the budget deficit? Because of these meetings and discussions with rank-and-file lawmakers, the resulting bill is most likely going to be deficit-neutral, said the senior White House official. But that won\u2019t be without some budgetary gymnastics. For example, some tax cuts are planned to show up in the Obamacare repeal, which will be paid for with cuts to Medicaid, effectively banking tax cuts first before a revenue-neutral plan. The plan may also use so-called dynamic scoring, to assume the tax plan can partly pay for itself with economic growth.\u2022How far off of the White House\u2019s April outline\u2014with a 15% corporate tax rate and an equal rate for noncorporate businesses\u2014will the administration go? \u201cIt really is just about seeing if there\u2019s some areas of agreement on those big architectural questions and some realization of what those different options mean,\u201d said the person familiar with the talks.The House GOP budget, which will be unveiled as soon as next week, will be the first clue as to where they are headed on all these questions, because the budget will set the procedural parameters for any tax bill that can move through the Senate without votes from Democrats.The strategy stems partly from the fight over health care legislation, when the House, Senate and White House didn\u2019t agree on goals up front. \u201cWe want this to be a far more collaborative process,\u201d the White House official said.The six face a daunting challenge. Once they reach agreement, they need to sell a plan to companies and individuals bound to fight back against lost tax breaks and their own party members worried about the big picture and tiny provisions.Messrs. Mnuchin and Cohn have been meeting with business groups and with more than 200 members of Congress since April and bringing those voices into the room, even if few details come out of it. They have been urging industry groups to reserve judgment until the full framework comes out. Messrs. Brady and Hatch have been doing the same\u2014trying to make sure they know what their members want and need.\u2014Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 10:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-tax-overhauls-fate-rests-on-big-six-talks-1499437368", "news_title": "GOP Tax Overhaul\u2019s Fate Rests on \u2018Big Six\u2019 Talks", "keywords": " gop, republicans,taxes, tax overhaul, tax policy, tax reform,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house"}, {"content": "At the Indian Health Service hospital in Pine Ridge, S.D., a 57-year-old man was sent home with a bronchitis diagnosis\u2014only to die five hours later of heart failure. When a patient at the federal agency\u2019s Winnebago, Neb., facility stopped breathing, nurses responding to the \u201ccode blue\u201d found the emergency supply cart was empty, and the man died. In Sisseton, S.D., a high school prom queen was coughing up blood. An IHS doctor gave her cough syrup and antianxiety medication; within days she died of a blood clot in her lung.In some of the nation\u2019s poorest places, the government health service charged with treating Native Americans failed to meet minimum U.S. standards for medical facilities, turned away gravely ill patients and caused unnecessary deaths, according to federal regulators, agency documents and interviews.The IHS, a unit of the Department of Health and Human Services, operates a network of hospitals and clinics, much like the Veterans Health Administration. Under U.S. treaties that date back generations, the service is legally responsible for providing medical care to about 2.2 million tribal members.But that system has collapsed in the often-remote corners of Indian Country, where patients live hours from other medical providers, often have no insurance and depend on the federal service.\u201cWe\u2019ve lost faith in the IHS, but we have no alternatives to go anywhere else,\u201d said       Lisa White       Pipe, a tribal council member for the Rosebud Sioux, whose father died last year after a delay in cancer treatment that she blames on the agency. Read more about his and other cases, and see the regulator\u2019s reports.The problems have come to a head in recent months after IHS hospitals repeatedly failed inspections, shut down services or lost access to crucial federal funds. Such failures have prompted new calls for broader oversight of the IHS by Congress. The Rosebud tribe, whose reservation stretches across a rural swath of South Dakota, is also now suing the agency in federal court, alleging that the IHS has failed to fulfill its treaty responsibility to care for tribal members.\u201cPeople are dying here as a result of the care they are not receiving, or the care they are receiving,\u201d said U.S. Sen.       John Barrasso,        (R., Wyo.), who until January chaired Congress\u2019s Indian Affairs Committee, in an interview.The latest crisis has arisen after the IHS and the Health Department failed to address a chorus of warnings over many years about neglect at the agency\u2019s facilities. The warnings came from lawmakers in both parties, internal whistleblowers and the families of patients who died. Over and over, they reported that IHS hospitals were plagued by inadequate supplies, poor training, overwhelmed staff and critical positions left unfilled.The agency has lacked a permanent director since 2015. People familiar with the matter said they expect a nominee for that post to be announced soon.Rear Adm. Michael D. Weahkee, the agency\u2019s current acting director, said in a statement after this article was published online, \u201cIHS is committed to improving patient safety and the quality of health care across the agency. We are faced with many challenges, but that is no excuse for substandard care.\u201d He said the agency is \u201cholding all employees fully accountable and working to improve the systems that recruit, retain, and support those employees to meet standards.\u201dAdm. Weahkee, a member of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which provides medical staff to federal agencies, was appointed to temporarily lead IHS in June.Back in 2010, a commission chaired by then-Sen. Byron Dorgan, (D., N.D.), found improperly credentialed medical staff were treating patients at some remote hospitals and employees accused of misconduct\u2014even crimes, including stealing drugs from hospital pharmacies\u2014weren\u2019t disciplined.The agency promised changes, but the situation has only disintegrated since, according to interviews with tribal officials, civil and criminal court records, and a raft of federal inspection reports.Wilmer Spotted Wood hobbled into the IHS hospital in Winnebago but was sent home without treatment despite medical staff documenting his severe back pain\u201410 on a scale of 10\u2014and ashen skin color, according to one of those reports.Hours later, a nurse read a test result that showed his kidneys were shutting down. The finding would normally lead to hospitalization, doctors say. Instead, the nurse left a phone message telling Mr. Spotted Wood to avoid calcium products like the antacid Tums and come back in two days, a federal inspection report said.One of his sisters, Betsy Spotted Wood, herself an IHS nurse who was at the hospital that day, said \u201chis skin coloring was way off. You could tell something was seriously wrong.\u201dMr. Spotted Wood didn\u2019t make it to his follow-up appointment. He died in his bed of kidney failure on Jan. 1, 2015, the day he had planned to return to the hospital.An IHS spokeswoman, Jennifer Buschick, provided a statement saying the agency wouldn\u2019t comment on specific medical cases, lawsuits or regulatory findings. Officials at the IHS\u2019s Maryland headquarters fielded queries from The Wall Street Journal related to the agency\u2019s individual hospitals and clinics.Following Mr. Spotted Wood\u2019s death, U.S. hospital regulators found the Winnebago facility failed to meet basic standards in 11 of 30 random cases they reviewed, including his case, during a routine inspection.Winnebago is one of seven IHS hospitals that the regulator, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said had put patients in danger since 2010\u2014more than a quarter of the 26 hospitals the IHS manages around the country.The IHS and tribal health advocates say Congress underfunds the agency, and the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 budget proposes cutting about $300 million, a roughly 6% decrease from its 2017 level.The IHS spent $3,688 on care for the average patient in 2015, according to an agency document. The Veterans Health Administration, for comparison, spent an average of $11,056 on medical services for each veteran receiving VA health care in 2015, that agency\u2019s records show. The two agencies count the users of their services differently, and their populations vary.Obesity and diabetes on the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations are more than 40% higher than nationwide, according to a Journal analysis of data from the University of Wisconsin.At least 50% of residents of those two reservations, as well as a third of those served by the Winnebago hospital, earned less than the federal poverty line, 2015 data show.Such factors, coupled with remoteness\u2014Rosebud is more than 100 miles from the nearest             Wal-Mart                  \u2014make recruitment difficult. The IHS said vacancy rates for medical staff at its Great Plains facilities run as high as 37%. By contrast, the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association reported only about 6% of nursing jobs vacant in 2015.Earlier this year, a longtime Pine Ridge pediatrician was indicted for allegedly sexually assaulting his patients. The doctor,       Stanley Patrick Weber,        who resigned last spring from the agency, pleaded not guilty. His lawyers didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The top medical officer at Winnebago was indicted late last year on allegations he defrauded Tennessee\u2019s Medicaid program before joining the IHS, court records show. The doctor,       Scott McLain,        had been brought on in a shake-up the IHS said showed commitment to high-quality care.Dr. McLain entered a plea of not guilty and has asked a judge to dismiss the case, his lawyer said. He said Dr. McLain had resigned from the IHS.In its written statement, the IHS declined to comment on the indictments. It said the agency has revamped staff credentialing procedures, overhauled management of many hospitals and brought in outside contractors to fill vacancies.The agency\u2019s seven sanctioned hospitals\u2014in Pine Ridge, Rosebud and Rapid City, S.D.; Cass Lake, Minn.; Crow Agency, Mont.; Acoma, N.M.; and the Winnebago facility that treated Mr. Spotted Wood\u2014all put patients in \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d of harm and failed to meet hospital requirements, according to federal regulators.The South Dakota and Nebraska facilities have each been cited for putting patients in danger multiple times. Since 2011, regulators reviewing cases at those four IHS hospitals said inadequate care contributed to at least 11 deaths, documents show.In a second statement after this article was published online, the IHS said it complies with widely accepted \u201cdeath review processes\u201d and reviews adverse events at the regional level, but doesn\u2019t report nationwide tallies of such incidents.The agency said, \u201cAny deficiency in service to patients receiving care at any IHS facility is unacceptable and does not reflect the organization\u2019s commitment to delivering a high quality of care to its patients. Upon learning of these survey results IHS immediately began instituting improvements at each hospital.\u201dIn many cases, the hospitals haven\u2019t fixed their problems, according to regulatory documents. In April, inspectors cited ongoing failures at the Rosebud hospital for at least the third time in a row; in 2015 and 2016, its emergency room was closed for seven months. In May, inspectors found the Pine Ridge facility had failed U.S. hospital requirements for the second time in five months. The Winnebago hospital has been barred since 2015 from billing Medicare because it failed to meet requirements for hospitals participating in federal programs, a punishment given to just five general hospitals in the U.S. that year, federal data show.In its initial written statement, the agency cited data showing many non-IHS hospitals in North and South Dakota and Nebraska also failed to meet requirements. It is less common though for regulators to cite hospitals for putting patients in danger in connection with such failures. Regulatory data show half of the eight facilities run by the IHS in the three states were found to have put patients in danger from 2011 to 2015. The data show the proportion for all non-IHS general hospitals with a patient-harm finding in those states was 7%.Some of the families of patients who died unexpectedly under the IHS\u2019s care said the toll extends beyond the hospitals that have been sanctioned. Among them, is       Wakanda Gonsalves,        a high school senior and prom queen, who went to an IHS clinic in Sisseton, S.D., on May 4, 2012, because she was coughing up blood. She was sent home that same day, with cough syrup, an inhaler and antianxiety medication. Two nights later, her parents woke to Ms. Gonsalves\u2019s screams, her mother, Lisa, recalled. They found her convulsing in bed before she went limp.\u201cMy husband kept doing CPR and chest compressions. Over and over,\u201d Lisa Gonsalves said. \u201cBut she had no pulse.\u201dAn autopsy showed Ms. Gonsalves suffered a blood clot in her lung. The IHS-contracted doctor who treated her said in a court deposition he didn\u2019t review an X-ray showing a lung abnormality, or follow up after an irregular blood test. The staffing agency that employed the doctor settled a lawsuit with Ms. Gonsalves\u2019s family for an undisclosed sum in 2015.In court filings, both the doctor and the contractor denied any wrongdoing. Lawyers for both didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.When confronted with regulatory failures, top IHS officials prioritized other matters, and Health Department leadership brushed aside warnings, records and interviews show.After a 2010 Senate hearing on Sen. Dorgan\u2019s probe outlining serious deficiencies in care and training, then-IHS director       Yvette Roubideaux       emailed agency employees, acknowledging problems and saying fixes \u201ccannot happen overnight.\u201d She asked staff to, among other things, \u201cput a story in the local newspaper about all the good things you are doing,\u201d according to a 2010 email reviewed by the Journal.In 2014, despite complaints of understaffing, Dr. Roubideaux dispatched 21 IHS medical staffers to West Africa to aid the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak, over protests of tribal health officials.\u201cIf the federal government is going to send public health officials anywhere it should be sending them to Indian Country,\u201d a tribal health committee wrote to Dr. Roubideaux.Dr. Roubideaux argued the outbreak was an unprecedented epidemic. The agency statement to the Journal said the staff was needed to help prevent a potential U.S. outbreak.Dr. Roubideaux, a Rosebud tribal member and Harvard-trained doctor who left the agency in 2015, referred inquiries from the Journal to the IHS about what she called \u201clongstanding\u201d problems.At a meeting of regional IHS heads in 2013 called by agency leadership, \u201cwe were basically told, \u2018these are your problems, you deal with it,\u2019 \u201d said       Anna Whiting       Sorrell, who formerly ran the IHS\u2019s Billings, Mont.-based region, where a hospital was sanctioned for dangerous care in 2014.The agency told the Journal that the IHS\u2019s regional chief medical officers have \u201cprimary responsibility for clinical issues.\u201dOne doctor, Alida Asencio, said she was ridiculed at staff meetings after telling the Winnebago medical director about problems in 2014. Dr. Asencio later raised a concern about a death at the hospital with regulators, who, documents show, concluded it was avoidable. She later complained to top agency officials that her supervisor pressured her to take paid leave ahead of an inspection to keep her from raising further concerns, an email viewed by the Journal shows.The agency said its \u201cleadership maintains a culture where employees are encouraged and expected to report any reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing, misconduct, waste, or abuse, particularly when it involves the safety and wellbeing of patients or employees.\u201d It said such disclosures can \u201csave lives.\u201dThen-U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, an Alaska Democrat, said he met with former Health and Human Services Secretary       Kathleen Sebelius       in 2012 to discuss IHS concerns. He said it was clear from the conversation that implementing the Affordable Care Act \u201ceclipsed things.\u201dMs. Sebelius said in an interview \u201cit\u2019s totally appropriate for him to say, \u2018they just didn\u2019t do enough,\u2019 \u201d referring to her own department. She said she took the IHS\u2019s failures seriously and tried to address them by seeking more funds and improving communication with tribes.The current Health Department secretary,       Tom Price,        said during his confirmation hearing in January he was committed to turning the IHS around.Some people who rely on the troubled hospitals said they are afraid to seek treatment there.Among them is the family of       Tonya Drapeau,        a 39-year-old mother of five from the Omaha reservation, who died suddenly in March 2016 after a visit to the Winnebago hospital. Days later, a government doctor wrote in a letter to an IHS official that Ms. Drapeau\u2019s treatment \u201cwas below the standard of care.\u201dHer family filed a legal claim alleging negligence in February with the Health Department, their lawyer said, the first step in filing a lawsuit against the U.S. government.Medical records show Ms. Drapeau went to Winnebago because she was having trouble breathing.The agency\u2019s records of her past care, which medical staff reviewed that morning, showed she had diabetes and a history of respiratory complications. A doctor didn\u2019t check her blood sugar and sent her home later that day with antianxiety pills.Hours later, Ms. Drapeau\u2019s teenage son found her unconscious. The records show she died, after being airlifted to a private hospital, of diabetic shock.Appeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'Federal Care Fails Tribes.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 10:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/people-are-dying-here-federal-hospitals-fail-native-americans-1499436974", "news_title": "\u2018People Are Dying Here\u2019: Federal Hospitals Fail Tribes", "keywords": " health-care,indian health services, indian hospitals, native americans, reservations,Indian Health Service,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,health care policy,political,general news,society,community,ethnic minorities,health,social issues,welfare,social services,health care,life sciences,hospital care,healthcare provision"}, {"content": "The Indian Health Service is responsible for providing medical care to about 2.2 million tribal members across the U.S., but the system is in crisis after IHS hospitals repeatedly failed inspections, shut down services or lost access to crucial federal funds.The facilities, which operate in some of the poorest areas of the country, have rendered dangerous care and caused unnecessary deaths, according to federal regulators, agency documents and interviews.The families of some IHS patients who died say the agency is responsible for their deaths.An IHS spokeswoman, Jennifer Buschick, provided a written statement saying the agency, a unit of the Department of Health and Human Services, declined to comment on specific medical cases, lawsuits or regulatory findings.Ten hours after nurses ignored a doctor\u2019s orders to stop giving Debra Free a powerful cocktail of narcotics, she died of an apparent opioid overdose at the Indian Health Service hospital in Winnebago, Neb.Federal hospital regulators laid the blame for her death at the feet of the hospital\u2019s medical staff, who they said disregarded concerns that the 45-year-old food-services worker was being over-sedated, documents from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services show.Ms. Free was initially admitted to the Winnebago IHS facility on April 5, 2011, for complications from toe amputations due to her chronic diabetes,\u00a0a common condition among Native Americans that the agency often treats.A federal inspection report found that on April 8, two different doctors told staff they were concerned that Ms. Free was being oversedated. At one point, one of the doctors ordered nurses to stop giving Ms. Free morphine and to remove a patch that dispensed Fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic narcotic. But that never happened, regulators found. Instead, a\u00a0nurse who was told to remove the Fentanyl patch mistakenly thought she was meant to leave it on until it expired\u00a0in 72 hours.When Ms. Free fell off her bed that night, medical staff responded by plying her with more pain medicine\u2014a sleeping pill and oxycodone\u2014regulators said.Ms. Free soon drifted into a catatonic state, sometimes coughing and frothing at the mouth, the report said. But even as her condition deteriorated, nurses never alerted doctors. Ms. Free was found dead in her bed by hospital staff in the early morning hours of April 9.According to Ms. Free\u2019s death certificate, the cause was cardiac arrest.CMS declined to comment on its report.Ms. Free\u2019s niece, Tori Kitcheyan, a Winnebago tribal councilor, helps take care of Ms. Free\u2019s only daughter, Angelina, now 15. Last year, Ms. Kitcheyan told her aunt\u2019s story before a congressional committee. She blames the IHS for Ms. Free\u2019s death and is leading a push for the tribe to take over operations of the hospital from the IHS.Ms. Kitcheyan recalled her aunt as a passionate cook, who devoted hours to preparing meals for family events.\u201cShe was a constant presence in our lives. Our family has never been the same since she died. It has been devastating,\u201d she said.Charles White Pipe, 68, a former tribal treasurer and council member for the Rosebud Sioux, was first diagnosed with lymph-node cancer on April 2, 2016. But it took the Indian Health Service until early May to approve specialized treatment at a private hospital, his daughter said.By then, Mr. White Pipe was near death and had complained of untreated pain for weeks.The IHS\u2019s program for referrals is\u00a0often short on funding, leaving patients waiting, IHS records show. An agency budget document said it rejected around 40% of such claims for needed treatment in 2015 because of a lack of funding.Lisa White Pipe, Charles\u2019s daughter and a Rosebud tribal councilor, said that after her father was diagnosed, he attempted several times to seek relief and treatment at the reservation\u2019s Indian hospital.On\u00a0April 21, Mr. White Pipe, unable to hold down any food, called the Rosebud hospital to say his pain was increasing, but he was told to wait at home for a referral to a cancer specialist, she said. A few days later, when he called again, a medical staffer said the facility was too crowded,\u00a0his daughter\u00a0said, noting that he wasn\u2019t prescribed additional medication for his pain.On the night of\u00a0April 27,\u00a0her father now barely able to walk, his legs and feet swollen, Ms. White Pipe drove him to the Rosebud hospital. Medical providers there informed Mr. White Pipe that his condition was terminal, gave him more pain medication and told him to keep waiting for his referral, his daughter said.When Mr. White Pipe finally received a referral to a Sioux Falls, S.D., cancer center, doctors there said it was too late to determine where the cancer originated and that there was little they could do, she recounted.He died\u00a0on May 28.\u201cIt felt undignified how he was treated,\u201d Ms. White Pipe said. \u201cHe was in pain and just pushed to the side.\u201dHours after she was discharged from the Indian Health Service hospital in Belcourt, N.D., with a diagnosis of pneumonia,\u00a0Shiree Wilson, a 24-year-old new mother, collapsed on the floor of her home and later died.Eight days earlier, on Jan. 14, 2014, Ms. Wilson\u2019s son had been delivered by caesarean section at the IHS hospital.Ms. Wilson, who was diagnosed with a mild cough and high white blood cell count in the days before she gave birth, returned to the facility on\u00a0Jan. 22, complaining that her cough had worsened.According to a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by Ms. Wilson\u2019s mother, Christine Fluhrer, tests conducted during that visit revealed fluid was possibly seeping into her lungs, her white blood cell count had risen and her heart was \u201cmildly enlarged.\u201d After diagnosing Ms. Wilson with pneumonia, doctors sent her home with decongestants and antibiotics.After she died, the Grand Forks County coroner found Ms. Wilson\u2019s heart weighed 580 grams, twice the normal heart weight for someone her age, and that she suffered from severe pulmonary congestion and edema, according to the court filings.The lawsuit alleges IHS medical staff failed to follow up, despite warning signs. A doctor also noted in Ms. Wilson\u2019s chart that he was concerned about a pulmonary embolism, the suit said.The IHS acknowledged the basic facts of Ms. Wilson\u2019s treatment and medical ailments, court filings show, though the agency denied any wrongdoing in her death.In November, the IHS settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed sum, Ms. Fluhrer\u2019s lawyer, Reed Soderstrom, said. He declined to comment further. Ms. Fluhrer said she didn\u2019t wish to discuss her daughter\u2019s death.According to an obituary, Ms. Wilson had worked at a local cafe for many years and wanted to learn how to cook. She loved swimming at the local pool and going to horse races. Her newborn son, Paxton, was her only child.When\u00a0Paul\u00a0West\u00a0stopped breathing in his hospital room, nurses responding to the \u201ccode blue\u201d couldn\u2019t find a crucial medical device used to prop open airways that was supposed to be stored in their emergency supply cart.That problem cost\u00a0the team of nurses and doctors responding to the incident a critical 20 minutes\u2014and Mr.\u00a0West, his life\u2014according to an internal report by an Indian Health Service nurse and a lawsuit brought by his family.Mr.\u00a0West, a 35-year-old porter at the local casino, was declared dead at the Winnebago hospital on April 17, 2014.\u201cDelay in care for patient, and ultimately death of patient,\u201d said the internal report, called a Code Blue Critique, examining the case.

Officials have indicated in recent weeks they could use the meeting after that, in September, to set into motion plans to start shrinking their large portfolio of bonds and other assets.The unemployment rate rose in June for the right reasons\u2014more Americans found jobs and more Americans went into the labor force to look for them. As a result, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.4% in June, even as employers added 222,000 jobs.Still, the report showed no obvious signs of wage pressures building. Hourly earnings have been rising steadily at 2.5% over the past year, though wage growth in May was revised down in Friday\u2019s report.Economists have been puzzling over the surprising drop in inflation starting in March, just after it touched the Fed\u2019s 2% annual target for the first time in years. Excluding food and energy, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge rose just 1.4% on the year ended May, down from 1.8% in February.Top Fed officials, including Chairwoman       Janet Yellen,        have said they expect the softening of inflation to be transitory, attributing much of it to a series of idiosyncratic declines, such as unlimited data plans for wireless phone carriers that pulled down prices.Ms. Yellen and others have put more emphasis on strong hiring and falling unemployment, which they believe should eventually lift inflation higher.The unemployment rate had fallen since January to a 16-year low of 4.3% in May, prompting Fed officials to lower their projections of where the unemployment rate would end the year. They said in June it would end the year within a range of 4.1% to 4.5%, down from their March estimate of 4.4% to 4.7%.A range of indicators \u201csignal a tight labor market,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at a press conference last month. \u201cNow, with inflation below 2%, I think it\u2019s appropriate that the labor market be that tight.\u201dFed officials voted in June to raise their benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 1% and 1.25%, and they took more steps to finalize plans to begin shrinking their holdings of more than $4 trillion in Treasury and mortgage securities later this year.Ms. Yellen said it was appropriate for the Fed to gradually remove the central bank\u2019s extraordinary support of the economy even if the Fed hadn\u2019t fully closed in on its inflation target because policy often operates with a lag. \u201cWe want to avoid the risk\u2026that at some point we find ourselves in a situation where we\u2019ve done nothing, and then need to raise\u201d the federal-funds rate \u201cso rapidly that we risk a recession,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen will testify before Congress Wednesday and Thursday, giving her an opportunity to further clarify the central bank\u2019s outlook on the economy and policy.The strong pace of hiring in June suggests there may be more slack in the labor market than a 4.4% unemployment rate would traditionally imply. Given the slower growth of the population than in the past, economists expect the economy needs to add fewer than 100,000 jobs a month to keep labor markets healthy. June\u2019s report showed the economy has added more than 193,000 jobs a month on average over the past three months.At the June Fed meeting, officials also penciled in one more quarter-point interest-rate increase this year. Several officials have said since then they would like to see proof that the recent slowdown in inflation is transitory.While large drops in prices of a handful of items, including wireless phone plans and prescription drugs, have pulled inflation readings lower, other categories such as apparel, health services and housing also have seen price pressures soften. Import prices, on the other hand, have risen in recent months, which could push goods inflation up in the coming months.Meantime, financial conditions have eased this year, with the dollar falling and stock prices running to new highs, which could give officials greater comfort to proceed with their plans to gradually raise interest rates.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 10:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/analysis-june-jobs-report-keeps-fed-policy-on-track-1499436389", "news_title": "Analysis: June Jobs Report Keeps Fed Policy on Track", "keywords": "employment report,fed,fed jobs,fed meeting,jobs report,june employment,june jobs,june jobs report,unemployment,us economy,Federal Reserve,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,employment,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,political,general news,general labor issues,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "MEXICO CITY\u2014Mexican inflation reached an eight-and-a-half year high in June, but showed signs of slowing toward the end of the month, supporting the central bank\u2019s decision to signal a halt in its cycle of interest-rate increases.The consumer-price index rose 0.25% last month, pushing the annual inflation rate up to 6.31% from 6.16% at the end of May, the National Statistics Institute said Friday. Core CPI, which excludes energy and fresh fruit and vegetables, rose 0.30% to an annual rate of 4.83%.After accelerating sharply at the start of the year on higher gasoline prices and the impact from a weaker Mexican peso, inflation appeared to be losing steam in June. The CPI rose just 0.03% in the last two weeks of the month, and the annual rate was practically unchanged from 6.3% midmonth.Food prices, including processed foods and fresh produce, were among the main contributors to inflation in June. Energy costs slipped as a drop in gasoline prices offset increases in propane gas used in homes for cooking and heating water. Airfares and tourism packages rose ahead of the summer holiday season.On June 22, the Bank of Mexico raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point to 7%, bringing short-term borrowing costs to their highest level since 2009, but adding that the increase was likely the last in the current cycle.In explaining the decision, the central bank noted that inflation was rising at a slower pace than in previous months. The bank expects inflation to peak over the summer and start to ease toward the end of the year, and that it will return to the 3% target in the fourth quarter of 2018.\u201cToday\u2019s data reinforce the central bank\u2019s message delivered in its last meeting that the tightening cycle is probably over.

Libya and Nigeria were exempted from the obligation to cut because their industries had been crippled by civil unrest.\u201cNigeria is definitely becoming a worry for us,\u201d said a delegate to OPEC from a Persian Gulf Arab country. OPEC delegates from several other countries echoed his concerns.The intended effect of the production-cut agreement was to bring the world\u2019s oversupply of oil back in line with demand and thereby boost slumping crude prices. Instead, the petroleum market has remained depressed this year, with prices stuck below $50 a barrel as oil supplies remain high across the world.Surging production from Libya and Nigeria are a significant reason prices haven\u2019t risen more, said Olivier Jakob, head of Swiss energy consultancy Petromatrix, in a note Thursday. OPEC\u2019s cut doesn\u2019t look so deep when you consider Libya and Nigeria.\u201cWith the return of Nigeria and Libya, OPEC\u2019s production is currently very close to the average of 2016,\u201d Mr. Jakob said.To be sure, Libya and Nigeria aren\u2019t the only reason oil prices remain low.U.S. output surged on the back of an initial price spike after OPEC\u2019s output deal last year and has managed to maintain those gains, flooding the market with more supplies. Global demand is growing but at a slower pace than in recent years.But Libya and Nigeria are factors more within OPEC\u2019s orbit of control.Russia, which has cut about 300,000 barrels a day, and some OPEC members have asked Nigeria and Libya to send their oil chiefs to a July 24 meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia. Their attendance would be unusual because the monthly meetings are focused on assessing the compliance of countries that agreed to cut.In a statement Friday, the Russian energy ministry said the meeting agenda could include proposals for changing OPEC\u2019s output agreement and \u201crecommendations on further steps, if necessary.\u201d The statement didn\u2019t mention Libya or Nigeria.According to people familiar with the matter, OPEC and Russia want Nigeria and Libya to provide details about production levels they can reasonably sustain. The people said the meeting could be a first step toward drafting production limits for Libya and Nigeria that would be voted on at the cartel\u2019s next meeting, Nov. 30 in Vienna.Such a move could spark an internal OPEC fight. At OPEC\u2019s last meeting in May, Nigeria\u2019s oil minister,       Emmanuel Ibe       Kachikwu, threatened to back out of any deal if he was forced to cut production, a person familiar with the matter said.In May, Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister,       Khalid al-Falih,        said OPEC was \u201cvery sympathetic with Libya and Nigeria\u201d and \u201cwould be happy for them\u201d if their production rose. \u201dThe rest of us will adjust to this situation when and if it happens,\u201d he added.Mr. Kachikwu told The Wall Street Journal a Nigerian representative would brief the committee, either in person in St. Petersburg or by other means.Nigerian oil production has surged about 200,000 barrels a day in the two months since             Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC brought back online the Forcados pipeline. The important piece of Nigeria\u2019s oil infrastructure had been disabled by militants in 2016.Mr. Kachikwu said his country\u2019s production remains below 1.8 million barrels a day, a level it has reached in the past and which he said OPEC internally considers to be Nigeria\u2019s potential cap. He said Nigeria would consider limiting its output but first needs a \u201cfew months to see if the recovery is permanent and sustainable.\u201dLast week, Libyan production surpassed 1 million barrels a day for the first time since 2013 after the authorities convinced militias in the West of the country to let giant oil fields reopen and a lull in fighting in the East enabled exports from oil ports to increase.\u00a0Production in the war-torn country has risen by 700,000 barrels a day in nine months.Abdelkarim Alhaderi,        Libya\u2019s national representative to OPEC, said Libya\u2019s goal remains ramping up to 1.6 million barrels a day, the amount it pumped before the 2011 ouster and death of dictator Moammar Gadhafi. But during an OPEC meeting last year in Algiers, Mr. Sanallah said its production capacity stood at 1.3 million barrels a day at most because of years of underinvestment, said a person who was present.Capping Libya\u2019s output would be discussed at OPEC\u2019s Nov. 30 meeting, Mr. Alhaderi said.\u2014James Marson in Moscow contributed to this articleWrite to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com and Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 09:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-considers-production-caps-for-libya-nigeria-1499427030", "news_title": "OPEC Considers Production Caps for Libya, Nigeria", "keywords": "crude prices,forcados pipeline,oil prices,oil production,opec,production caps,OPEC,output,production,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction"}, {"content": "For noncitizens, minor crimes like shoplifting can result in deportation. But a growing number of district attorneys say they offer immigrants accused of crimes plea deals to help them avoid that fate.The prosecutors, including at least six in jurisdictions on the East and West coasts,\u00a0purposely avoid reaching plea agreements or sentences that might trigger a\u00a0noncitizen\u2019s deportation or prevent his or her re-entry into the country. It is an arrangement that proponents say protects some noncitizen immigrants from the disproportionate consequences of minor convictions, but critics, including U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, contend is unethical because it treats citizens and noncitizens differently.These local prosecutors, who have significant discretion in how they charge crimes, say they are also promoting public safety by courting immigrant constituents\u2019 trust. \u201cI saw what were, in my opinion, many miscarriages of justice,\u201d said Acting Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, of immigrants deported as the result of low-level convictions. His office recently adopted a policy of considering and trying to minimize the immigration impacts of convictions and hired two immigration attorneys to train his staff.One of his inspirations, he said, was a Brooklyn man arrested for being unescorted in an apartment building. At the precinct, police officers discovered the man had a small amount of crack cocaine. In court, the man, a green-card holder from Haiti, pleaded guilty to drug possession. When he tried to come home after visiting Haiti, border officials wouldn\u2019t let him return.Under the new policy, prosecutors might have offered the green-card holder a trespassing plea, which wouldn\u2019t have triggered immigration problems, instead of drug charges, which typically do.Critics say such policies are unfair. Speaking on Long Island in April, Mr. Sessions said, \u201cIt troubles me that we\u2019ve seen district attorneys openly brag about not charging cases appropriately under the laws of our country, so that provides an opportunity for individuals not to be convicted of a crime that might lead to deportation.\u201dTom Fitton,        president of conservative foundation Judicial Watch, called such policies \u201cdangerous and arguably unconstitutional.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t give people special treatment for prosecutorial decisions based on country of origin or immigration status,\u201d Mr. Fitton said. \u201cThe logic here is American citizens might be prosecuted more harshly for the same crimes.\u201dUntil this year, the approach of different charges for noncitizens was largely a California phenomenon. The San Francisco district attorney has no official policy but for at least a decade has offered some noncitizens pleas that help them avoid deportation, according to a spokesman.In 2011, the Santa Clara County District Attorney\u2019s Office released a policy of taking immigration consequences into account. District Attorney Jeff Rosen said he was prompted by his own plea-negotiating experience, during which defense attorneys would ask for pleas that would help immigrants, many of whom were longtime residents with families, avoid deportation.After the policy came out, \u201cI heard from colleagues, \u2018You\u2019re a Bay Area hippie liberal,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rosen said. He disputed the characterization\u2014\u201cI\u2019m married and drive a gray Camry,\u201d he said. But now he rarely gets such comments because such policies are more commonplace in California.Other California prosecutors offices followed. Alameda County, which includes Oakland, issued guidelines in 2012 instructing prosecutors to consider immigration consequences for lesser crimes.Back east, the Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office in April told employees to consider immigration consequences when prosecuting low-level, nonviolent crimes. Last month, the office held a mandatory training session for prosecutors on how certain pleas affect noncitizen defendants, State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said.Also this year, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which has no official policy, created a yet-unfilled position dubbed the Collateral Consequences Counsel.\u201cI submit today that if two New Yorkers commit the same low-level violation, and the practical consequence for one of the New Yorkers is a ticket or a couple of days in jail, while the consequence for the other New Yorker is to be taken from her family and shipped off to a foreign country, that is not equal justice under law,\u201d District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in May.Approaches to such policies differ. In Santa Clara County, someone who pleads to a lower charge often gets a stiffer sentence. A noncitizen accused of shoplifting whose charge is reduced from petty theft to \u201ctrespass to interfere with business\u201d might get extra time in a work program.The office estimates it modifies a plea or sentence for immigration reasons from 300 to 400 times a year, or in less than 1% of total cases, Mr. Rosen said.The policy had been largely uncontroversial until April, when a public outcry followed an article in online publication the Daily Beast about a case in which an Indian green-card holder was accused by his wife, a citizen, of domestic violence. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this,\u201d the wife, an engineer, cries repeatedly in a video she recorded on her iPhone, followed by smacking sounds in the background.Santa Clara prosecutors charged the man, also an engineer, with two counts of felony domestic violence, which could have resulted in his deportation. He later pleaded to lesser charges of felony accessory and misdemeanor domestic battery.\u201cThey should have just charged him with what he did,\u201d said Michael Pascoe, an attorney for the woman.Michael Paez, an attorney for the man, said the evidence against his client was inconsistent. Mr. Rosen said that although immigration status was one factor in the plea agreement, prosecutors were concerned they lacked the evidence to prove the initial charges at trial.Some offices with such policies say such discretion isn\u2019t limited to immigration, and they consider the effects of pleas on other circumstances, like employment or ability to attend college.Such policies are likely to continue to be subjects of discussion at prosecutors\u2019 offices nationwide.In Denver, District Attorney Beth McCann weighed adopting a policy of considering immigration consequences but struggled with concerns that it wouldn\u2019t apply justice fairly, a spokesman said.\u201cWhy would you treat an undocumented member of the community better than an American citizen?\u201d said the spokesman, Ken Lane. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t resolved that issue in terms of a formal policy.\u201dWrite to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.comAppeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'Prosecutors Cut Deals to Stave Off Deportations.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 09:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-prosecutors-offer-plea-deals-to-avoid-deportation-of-noncitizens-1499419802", "news_title": "Some Prosecutors Offer Plea Deals to Avoid Deportation of Noncitizens ", "keywords": "courts,crime,deportation,illegal immigrants,immigration,justice,plea,prosecutors,political,general news,legal action,migration,politics,international relations,burglary,theft"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014Look out, America: Here comes \u201cHonor of Kings,\u201d the Chinese videogame so addictive that its maker imposed a curfew on the youngest enthusiasts and daily playing-time limits on players through age 18.An English-language version is being developed by producer             Tencent Holdings Ltd.

Berkshire also makes large stock investments.Utilities are also considered safe investments by ratings firms, helping support Berkshire\u2019s overall credit rating. And the energy unit receives tax credits for its investments in renewable energy that it can apply to the conglomerate\u2019s massive balance sheet.\u201cWe will continue to buy and build utility operations throughout the world for decades to come,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in his 2014 letter to shareholders.Oncor is an electricity mover, transmitting power over 121,000 miles of lines across the largest electrical-distribution network in Texas, according to the company.Energy Future has spent the past three-plus years in one of the largest-ever bankruptcy proceedings.             KKR                   & Co., TPG and             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s       private-equity arm led the $32 billion takeover of TXU, which became Energy Future. When the deal was announced in 2007, the buyers were betting that natural-gas prices would rise, but they tumbled amid a boom in shale-gas production.The drop in natural gas caused electricity prices to fall in Texas, resulting in billions of dollars of losses for Energy Future after it took on massive debt in the buyout.Texas regulators, worried about what would become of part of the state\u2019s electricity backbone in the hands of private-equity owners, had insisted on shielding Oncor from the financial trouble that was to push Energy Future into chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Mr. Buffett has dealt with Energy Future before, but his past experience with the company wasn\u2019t a success. Berkshire spent $2.1 billion in 2007 on high-yielding Energy Future Holdings bonds. It sold the bonds in 2013 and lost $873 million pretax on the investment, Mr. Buffett said in his 2013 letter to shareholders.\u201cMost of you have never heard of Energy Future Holdings. Consider yourselves lucky; I certainly wish I hadn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in the letter. In a prior letter, he said he had \u201ctotally miscalculated the gain/loss probabilities when I purchased the bonds.\u201dAn Oncor purchase would be the acquisition of a business rather than a financial investment.Energy Future has been trying to sell its 80% stake in Oncor, but Texas regulators have stymied attempts at deals by Hunt Consolidated Inc. of Texas and Florida\u2019s             NextEra Energy Inc.,       leaving the company mired in bankruptcy. Berkshire was also a contender.Texas regulators said the Hunt-led deal included too much financial engineering to suit them, while NextEra was rejected for insisting on overriding much of the protections that prevented Energy Future from imposing excessive debt on Oncor, and guaranteed the unit kept a separate board of directors.CreditSights analyst       Greg Jones       said the restrictions were unlikely to be an issue with Berskshire. \u201cBerkshire will likely go to the regulators hat in hand and say, \u2018What can we do for you to make this happen,\u2019 rather than other utilities that were trying to say, \u2018It\u2019s our way or the highway,\u2019\u201d he said.Berkshire Hathaway Energy doesn\u2019t pay dividends to investors, which makes it popular with state regulators, Mr. Buffett has said in shareholder letters.Terry Hadley,        spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which was instrumental in blocking the two prior deals for Oncor, declined to comment on the regulatory prospects.Last year, Mr. Buffett closed his largest deal ever when Berkshire bought industrial company Precision Castparts. The billionaire investor also has joined forces with Brazilian private-equity firm 3G Capital Partners LP to help create a global food empire, merging Kraft and Heinz and making an unsuccessful attempt to buy consumer goods giantUnilever                   PLC.An Oncor deal would still leave Berkshire with plenty of cash to spend. The conglomerate held $96.5 billion in cash as of March 31. Mr. Buffett has said he likes to keep a minimum of $20 billion on hand in case of unexpected insurance losses.Last month, Berkshire made two smaller investments, rescuing struggling Canadian mortgage lender Home Capital Group Inc. and buying a stake in real-estate investment trust Store Capital Corp.Evercore and Kirkland & Ellis LLP advised Oncor on the deal.             Citigroup                   and Gibson, Dunn& Crutcher LLP advised Berkshire Hathaway on the deal.Write to Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.com, Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.com and Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Buffett Makes $9 Billion Energy Play.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 09:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/warren-buffetts-berkshire-nears-a-deal-to-buy-oncor-1499363036", "news_title": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Oncor Play Shows Berkshire\u2019s Energy Ambitions ", "keywords": "bankruptcy, berkshire, buffett,deals, electricity,energy future,oncor,private equity , texas,txu,Berkshire Hathaway,BRKA,Oncor,Berkshire Hathaway Energy,Precision Castparts,Energy Future Holdings,Berkshire Hathaway Cl B,BRK.B,Mr. Buffett,Greg Abel,Warren Buffett,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,natural gas markets,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,electric power distribution,renewable energy generation,metal products,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,electric utilities,natural gas,oil exploration,industrial goods,utilities"}, {"content": "When the sun radiates blistering heat, how hot the air feels depends on how much moisture is in it.Ninety degrees Fahrenheit could pass for an unpleasant 100 degrees or a dangerous 132.Meteorologists call this the heat index, a value that combines the effects of air temperature and relative humidity to represent the perceived temperature. The index is derived from a mathematical equation that accounts for everything from body size to vapor pressure.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like an engineering problem,\u201d said Eli Jacks, chief of the forecast services division for the National Weather Service. \u201cIt has to do with the basic body dimensions and how much skin is exposed.\u201dThe combination of high humidity and temperature is dangerous because it impairs the body\u2019s ability to cool itself off. The risk is dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat stroke or death.Last year, nearly 100 people in the U.S. died from heat. This year, more than a dozen deaths are believed to be heat-related in the Phoenix area, which was so hot last month that airlines grounded more than 40 flights.Each of the National Weather Service\u2019s 122 offices issues alerts at its own discretion, but in general, an advisory is issued if within 12 hours the heat index temperature is expected to hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit and last for at least two days. A warning is issued if in the same period the index is expected to hit at least 105 degrees.When the body gets hot, it sweats, and when the perspiration evaporates, it carries away heat. But if the air is already soggy, the perspiration has nowhere to go.\u201cThat\u2019s when you see sweat pool on the skin,\u201d Mr. Jacks said. \u201cThe rate at which water evaporates from the skin decreases, therefore the cooling effect decreases.\u201dRelative humidity, which is expressed as a percentage, indicates how much water vapor is in the air versus how much it could hold.\u201cIt\u2019s like a glass of water,\u201d said George Winterling, a retired meteorologist who developed a precursor to the heat index in 1978 for WJXT television in Jacksonville, Fla. \u201cIf the glass is half full, you have 50% water. If the relative humidity is 50%, you have half as much moisture as the air could possibly contain.\u201dIf humidity is low, the temperature may feel cooler than it is.On June 21, the temperature in Phoenix was 116 degrees, the relative humidity was 7%, and the heat index was 108.\u201cExtremely low relative humidity enables very rapid evaporative cooling from your skin, thereby making it feel cooler than the actual air temperature,\u201d Mr. Jacks said. \u201cBut at 108, it\u2019s still plenty hot.\u201dA more precise but less familiar measurement is dew point, the temperature below which water vapor begins to condense, forming dew, fog or raindrops.\u201cIf the dew point is in the 60s in the summer, it\u2019s a little humid,\u201d Mr. Jacks said. \u201cIf it gets into the upper 60s, it\u2019s pretty bad. In the 70s, it\u2019s really oppressive.\u201dThe heat index, which the National Weather Service has used since 1979, is based on the work of R.G. Steadman, a professor in the textiles and clothing department of Colorado State University in Fort Collins, who created a chart of values using the dew point.Mr. Steadman\u2019s calculations, which incorporated about 20 different variables, were extremely complex. In 1990, Lans Rothfusz, who is now deputy director of the National Severe Storms Laboratory, devised an equation that approximated Mr. Steadman\u2019s results, allowing anyone to do the math by plugging in air temperature and relative humidity:Heat index = -42.379 + 2.04901523*T + 10.14333127*RH - .22475541*T*RH - .00683783*T*T - .05481717*RH*RH + .00122874*T*T*RH + .00085282*T*RH*RH - .00000199*T*T*RH*RHThe equation is valid for temperatures ranging from 80 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity ranging from 40% to 100%.But the index, once calculated, is not one-size fits-all. It applies to someone who is 5 feet, 7 inches tall, weighs 147 pounds, is wearing long trousers and a short-sleeved shirt and is walking 3.1 miles an hour in the shade with the wind blowing at about 5.75 miles an hour.With such specific variables applied to the greater population, it amounts to a loose guideline.\u201cIt gives you a frame of reference that it could be worse than the air temperature,\u201d Mr. Rothfusz said. \u201cThe heat index is nothing more than an indication for us to pay attention.\u201dBut if you do that, he said, the index has done its job\u2014no sweat.Write to Jo Craven McGinty at Jo.McGinty@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/heat-index-captures-real-feel-of-torrid-temperatures-1499432400", "news_title": "Heat Index Captures Real Feel of Torrid Temperatures", "keywords": "extreme weather,heat index,high humidity,national weather service,phoenix heat wave,weather,weather-related deaths,political,general news"}, {"content": "Ultra-high net worth investors are sitting on too much cash, according to UBS. And it could be hurting their returns.UBS, the world\u2019s largest wealth manager, said in a report that investors with at least $30 million in investible assets tend to maintain high cash allocations, often in the region of 35% of their total portfolio.These high cash levels may be creating a drag on the performance of their assets, the report said. Over the past decade, cash has returned 1.1% on an annualized basis. In comparison an even split of private equity and hedge funds would have returned 3.8%.The aftermath of the financial crisis and recent market volatility have pushed investors toward lower-risk investments.But the report suggested, among other things, that a greater proportion of illiquid investments could give investors higher returns.While illiquidity can provide greater returns in the long run, palpable positive effects are possible only when high amounts of capital are available, the report suggested, warning that the \u201cbar for admissions is high.\u201dThe majority of illiquid investments cannot be traded in a market. It can take years for returns to be realized, the report said, adding that exposure to these sorts of assets must be maintained \u201cover the long term.\u201d\u201cSince there is no continuous market, or pricing, for unlisted assets and any reporting is infrequent, they are not suited to investors who need constant performance updates,\u201d the UBS said.The risk of not being able to easily exit positions to raise cash \u201ccan be difficult,\u201d the report conceded.Other suggestions made by UBS include investing in higher education endowments, harvesting the value of peer networks, and capitalizing on differences in regional banking regulations.Wealth X, a marketing consultant, said there are about 226,000 individuals world-wide with investible assets worth more than $30 million, and estimated there will be about 300,000 such investors in 2021.Write to Donato Paolo Mancini at donatopaolo.mancini@dowjones.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 08:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/super-rich-sit-on-too-much-cash-ubs-report-says-1499431864", "news_title": "Super-Rich Sit On Too Much Cash, UBS Report Says", "keywords": "cash holding,cash investment,fund investment,investment ideas,ultra high net worth,political,general news,investor education,personal finance,personal investments"}, {"content": "Two obscure companies with no sales raised nearly $400 million combined in recent days from outside investors. How did they do it? Via a new, unregulated fundraising method that has no connection to Wall Street and is based in the world of cryptocurrencies.These fundraisings, called \u201cInitial Coin Offerings,\u201d are exploding in value. So far this year, companies have raised more than $1 billion this way. That is 10 times the amount raised in 2016, according to Smith & Crown, a digital-currency research firm.\u201cIt\u2019s very hot right now,\u201d said Marco Santori, a partner at Palo Alto, Calif.-based law firm Cooley LLP, who advises startups on structuring their\u00a0coin\u00a0offerings. \u201cFor the last six months, it\u2019s been about 60% of my work flow.\u201dThe excitement around these coin offerings has helped fuel this year\u2019s sharp rise in virtual currencies bitcoin and ether, which investors typically use to purchase coins. In the first half of 2017, Bitcoin rose 160%; ether rose 3,350%.The latest companies involved in coin offerings\u2014software startups Dynamic Ledger Solutions Inc., known for its Tezos software project, and block.one\u2014attracted more funds, combined, than the $300 million raised at the end of June by             Blue Apron Holdings Inc.in a closely followed initial public offering.Those two coin offerings also raised amounts nearly equal to what companies tend to fetch by going the traditional IPO route. In 2016, U.S. companies undertaking IPOs on average raised about $219 million, according to Dealogic.In a coin offering, the coins being sold are similar to bitcoin and ether. Investors purchase a coin, or digital token, that they can use in the future to buy a product or service a company plans to offer.The coins\u00a0usually don\u2019t confer any ownership in a company. Rather, investors hope they will rise in value over time if a company\u2019s product or service is popular.The coin offerings\u2019 success comes despite the companies\u2019 youth: Dynamic Ledger is just three years old and block.one was founded this year. Both have only a handful of employees; their products aren\u2019t yet fully developed. Blue Apron, by contrast, has been around for five years, has a well-known meal-kit business and had nearly $800 million in revenue last year.One risk for coin sales: There are no rules or legal standards around such offerings.Buying into a coin offering is like purchasing a ticket to a Broadway show months or even years before a performance hits the stage. If the production is the next \u201cHamilton,\u201d the ticket, or in this case the coin, could later be sold for multiples of its initial purchase price.If the play isn\u2019t produced, though, or if it turns out to be a flop, the ticket would be worthless. The same could prove true for some coin offerings.Coin offerings are more like crowdfunding campaigns than a traditional securities offering. Most offerings don\u2019t have a detailed prospectus, rather companies typically publish a so-called white paper outlining their project or idea. Sometimes the offerings are handled through a nonprofit foundation\u2014such as the Zug, Switzerland-based Tezos Foundation\u2014to further distance them from the characteristics of a security.But the huge amounts companies are raking in could attract greater scrutiny from regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or authorities in other countries. The SEC declined to comment.Polybius Bank, an Estonia firm that is looking to build a cryptocurrency-based online bank, did create a prospectus. It raised $28.9 million in a June offering. The prospectus said that its tokens wouldn\u2019t be registered under U.S. securities laws, nor offered or sold in the country.The coin\u00a0offerings have opened up vast pools of capital, sometimes from venture-capital investors, to dozens of firms that likely wouldn\u2019t be able to raise funding in traditional capital markets.block.one raised $185 million worth of bitcoin and ether last weekend in its coin\u00a0offering, according to Smith & Crown. Executives at block.one weren\u2019t available to comment.Dynamic Ledger\u2019s Tezos topped that, raising about $212 million worth of bitcoin and ether between the weekend and Thursday.The projects being pursued by these two companies aim to create new types of digital platforms, akin to mini versions of the internet, that use a communication language called the blockchain. This is the technology that underpins bitcoin.Dynamic Ledger\u2019s Tezos digital platform is the older of the two projects and is the brainchild of Arthur and       Kathleen Breitman,        a husband-and-wife team in their late 20s. He had worked at             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       and             Morgan Stanley,       while she had done stints at hedge-fund manager Bridgewater Associates and consulting firm             Accenture.The Breitmans have been working on Tezos for three years, mostly in anonymity. Tezos, Mrs. Breitman said in an interview, was \u201cdead in the water in 2015.\u201d The couple released a test version of their product, but it didn\u2019t receive any attention from developers.It became something more as the coin-offering market developed through 2016. Investors were looking for places to deploy their capital and Tezos started gaining attention.They were also helped by having one prominent backer:       Tim Draper,        a founder of the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Mr. Draper\u2019s small undisclosed personal investment in the firm, and his public pledge to buy into the initial coin\u00a0offering, significantly raised Tezos\u2019s profile.Mr. Draper said he believed in Tezos, as well as another token in which he had invested, for the startup Bancor, and the companies\u2019 potential to bring about \u201ca sea change as big as the internet.\u201dEven so, the recent offering outdid the couple\u2019s expectations. \u201cIn December, I had a dream that we raised $40 million,\u201d Mrs. Breitman said, \u201cand I thought, \u2018That\u2019s impossible.\u2019\u201dWrite to Paul Vigna at paul.vigna@wsj.comAppeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'Startups Draw On Coin Offerings.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 08:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/forget-an-ipo-coin-offerings-are-new-road-to-startup-riches-1499425200", "news_title": "Forget an IPO, Coin Offerings Are New Road to Startup Riches", "keywords": "bitcoin,coin offering,coin sales,cryptocurrencies,digital token,ether,fundraising,initial coin offering,ipo, ipos,software startups ,startups ,virtual currencies,Cooley,Dynamic Ledger Solutions,block.one,Bancor,Kathleen Breitman,corporate changes,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,legal services,business,consumer services,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014Global financial stability will be endangered if President       Donald Trump       abandons regulatory agreements made after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the European Union\u2019s financial-services chief told The Wall Street Journal.Valdis Dombrovskis       said he wants to prevent a race to the bottom that could unwind rules world leaders enacted following the 2008 financial crisis to safeguard the world\u2019s financial system.\u201cIt is important all sides implement those international standards and are not starting to cherry pick,\u201d Mr. Dombrovskis said.More on WSJ Pro Financial RegulationWorld leaders are gathering for the G-20 summit in Germany, where International Monetary Fund chief       Christine Lagarde       and German Finance Minister       Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble       said Thursday that Mr. Trump shouldn\u2019t turn his back on free trade and that the U.S. would lose influence if it adopted protectionist policies.\u201cInternational cooperation has become harder over the past months and the new U.S. administration is the key driver for that,\u201d said       Markus Ferber,        a German member of the European Parliament.Mr. Dombrovskis was formerly prime minister of Latvia and known for his hard-headed response to the financial crisis, refusing to devalue the then-Latvian currency and instead driving through deep budget cuts and reforms. Latvia is a member of the EU and joined the euro in 2014.He told The Wall Street Journal that Mr. Trump\u2019s potential scale back of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial rules had sparked concern.\u201cThe question is what direction this work takes, whether it is targeted adjustments in areas deemed necessary or if it is amounting to some sort of deregulation,\u201d Mr. Dombrovskis said. \u201cThere are some elements where we have certain concerns, like proposals to postpone the implementation of internationally already-agreed standards.\u201dWorries about global cooperation have intensified following Britain\u2019s decision to exit the European Union in 2016 and the Trump administration\u2019s apparent lack of interest in international rule-making bodies. Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said Thursday that the U.S. president should focus on the development of global institutions and use them to help combat the economic imbalances posed by globalization.Mr. Dombrovskis said the bloc remained committed to working closely with the U.S. He has been to the U.S. three times since taking his post, the first a trip to New York only 24 hours after taking office.One year ago, he inherited an ambitious agenda for integrating EU capital markets. The issue has assumed new importance since London, the EU\u2019s capital markets hub, will soon be outside the bloc. Mr. Dombrovskis said Brexit has increased the need to deepen EU capital markets.The commissioner is also grappling with Italian banks that are mired in bad debts and that have sparked controversy over bank-bailout rules, as well as spats among European authorities trying to grab business from London post-Brexit.EU officials and industry participants describe the commissioner as pragmatic and balanced. Yet he has shown a willingness to put the EU first at times.In light of the Brexit vote, the commission put forward a politically sensitive proposal that could allow EU authorities to force clearinghouses that do a large chunk of business in euros to move into the bloc or bolster extraterritorial supervision powers. The move puts London at risk of losing its dominance over the multitrillion dollar clearinghouse market.While the proposal wasn\u2019t the nuclear option the U.K. had feared\u2014an automatic relocation of clearinghouses that clear large volumes of euro-denominated contracts\u2014it gave a strong signal that the EU was prepared to play tough as Brexit negotiations begin.Mr. Dombrovskis said the EU\u2019s new policy on supervising clearing wouldn\u2019t affect existing arrangements with the U.S.\u201cThis concept of dual supervision should not be a strange concept to the U.S.\u201d said Mr. Dombrovskis. \u201cWe were drawing from our experience with the U.S. on this dual-supervision framework when drafting our amendments.\u201dHe also defended the EU\u2019s position in a protracted fight over capital-requirement rules that European banks say would put them at a competitive disadvantage versus U.S. counterparts.To reduce regulatory competition among EU countries, Mr. Dombrovskis is reviewing the bloc\u2019s supervisory systems and considering giving the Paris-based European Securities Markets Authority more power. He expects to launch a proposal on the matter in September.He is steering 17 legislative proposals on issues ranging from rules to bolster securitization, to changing bankruptcy laws to boost cross-border investment. Only six of these proposals were inherited from his predecessor, highlighting Mr. Dombrovskis\u2019s push to integrate Europe\u2019s financial markets and respond to problems posed by Brexit.\u201cI think he is making an impact\u2014the commission is producing pretty bold legislative proposals,\u201d said       Nicolas Veron       of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Along with other EU officials, Mr. Dombrovskis is promoting \u201cgreen finance\u201d\u2014something the U.S. has shown less interest in, according to people familiar with discussions. Climate and energy issues are likely to be contentious at this weekend\u2019s meeting in Hamburg since Mr. Trump backed out of the Paris agreement.Before leaving office in two years, Mr. Dombrovskis may propose legislation to advance this agenda. \u201cIt is important to meet our Paris climate-change goals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working on how to put sustainable finance to work to reach those goals.\u201dWrite to       Julia-Ambra Verlaine       at julia.verlaine@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 07:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-financial-services-chief-warns-on-dodd-frank-review-and-deregulation-1499427285", "news_title": "EU Financial-Services Chief Warns on Dodd-Frank Review and Deregulation ", "keywords": " hamburg g-20, trump europe,trump regulation,European Union,Valdis Dombrovskis,Donald Trump,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,securities regulations,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,banking,credit,financial services,regional banks"}, {"content": "Good morning.

As CMO Today\u2019s Alex Bruell reports, picking up a Cannes Lion or two can help with staffers\u2019 recruitment prospects; they also can be tied to client objectives and even individual bonuses. As one recruiter points out, there are \u201cnot a lot of ways to measure [creativity] objectively,\u201d so awards can help assess the merits of one candidate over another, which could give Publicis staffers looking for new roles a disadvantage. The marketing boss at Patr\u00f3n Spirits, a Publicis client, said he even might consider paying for its own awards submissions next year if its agency won\u2019t. Publicis CEO Arthur Sadoun, meanwhile, said he\u2019s not a party pooper: \u201cDon\u2019t get us wrong: we love awards and the celebration of great creative work.\u201d But when push comes to shove, Publicis loves Marcel more at the moment. Ah, young love.Food brands such as Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Aunt Jemima pancake mix and Hamburger Helper are fast becoming childhood nostalgia as opposed to the grocery staples they once were. \u201cBig Food\u201d giants are struggling with a pincer movement of problems: High-end consumers are choosing fresher fare with fewer processed ingredients, while penny-pinchers are no longer afraid to buy cheaper private-label brands that don\u2019t require much marketing beyond being prominently displayed on shelves. It\u2019s a classic marketing school case study.

But QVC\u2019s CEO thinks combining the two will give its TV channels\u2014where customers \u201cform a connection with the hosts,\u201d rather than simply performing a transaction\u2014more scale, which will help in pricing negotiations with suppliers. The new entity also wants to invest in new technologies like mobile commerce and digital video, which could help stave off the threat of cord-cutting\u2014although, let\u2019s face it, home shoppers are hardly the cord-cutting type. There aren\u2019t too many examples in history of when a merger of two struggling companies created a successful one, but in the increasingly difficult battle to stay relevant to shoppers, two heads are going to be better than one.Hilton has a new midprice brand called Tru, and it\u2019s planning a big expansion over the next two years.

A 500 Startups spokeswoman didn\u2019t answer a request for comment regarding the firm\u2019s diversity initiatives.Despite the inappropriate advances that Mr. McClure has acknowledged making toward women, Ms. McDermott and others still say 500 Startups helped many women and other members of underrepresented groups find their footing in the tech industry around the world.\u201cI\u2019ve seen female founders...of different backgrounds and races and people from the LGBT community, they all felt for a while that that was the only place they could go,\u201d said Tatyana Kanzaveli, who has served as a mentor for 500 Startups since 2012. 500 Startups was \u201cready to open doors to founders who otherwise would\u2019ve been neglected by everyone else,\u201d she added. Ms. Kanzaveli and Ms. McDermott both emphasized they condemned Mr. McClure\u2019s treatment of women.Mountain View, Calif.-based 500 Startups, co-founded by Mr. McClure and Christine Tsai in 2010, had one of the most diverse teams of any venture firm in the industry. In the past five years alone, it invested in 162 companies with at least one female founder, according to industry tracker PitchBook Data Inc.These include cosmetics company Ipsy, launched by Michelle Phan, and Conekta, a payments startup from Mexico that was co-founded by Cristina Randall.Therein lies a quandary, some people said, for current and potential limited partners in 500 Startups. If they stop funding 500 Startups because of Mr. McClure\u2019s transgressions, they would, by extension hurt the great number of diverse startups that had been getting support from the firm.\u201cIf 500 Startups ceased to exist, hypothetically, that\u2019s not a win for women,\u201d Ms. McDermott said.500 Startups wasn\u2019t shy about building its brand by touting ties to prominent women, in questionable fashion at times.It used the names of premier advocates of female empowerment and diversity such as Sheryl Sandberg, Randi Zuckerberg and       Mitch Kapor,        in its fundraising materials, for example.These names appeared on a slide under the title \u201cNotable 500 Startups LPs\u201d for the fundraising pitch deck dated last November, viewed by WSJ Pro Venture Capital, for a 500 fintech fund.Ms. Sandberg wasn\u2019t aware of an investment into 500 Startups that had been made by her late husband in 2013 through their family trust, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person said that Ms. Sandberg had no other connection to 500 Startups and wasn\u2019t aware that her name had been used in its pitches. Ms. Zuckerberg didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.A 500 Startups\u2019 spokeswoman said that the firm has stopped using that slide in its presentations.\u201cWhile at one point there was a historic iteration of the deck that mistakenly included a \u2018notable LPs\u2019 slide, upon the advice of our legal team this slide was prohibited from all 500 marketing materials some time ago,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThe footnotes to the slide made clear that not all the people listed had invested in a personal capacity and may have used other entities.\u201dThe spokeswoman declined to say how many funds and for how long the slide had been used.500 Startups\u2019 other activities related to diversity included holding \u201cunity and inclusion\u201d summits. It also released data on gender diversity in its funds.It even joined the National Venture Capital Association\u2019s Diversity Task Force in signing a letter to President Barack Obama in 2015 committing to inclusion. Signatories of the letter pledged to adopt human-resources policies to create \u201cwork environments that foster respect and dignity for all,\u201d and to take other actions in the name of inclusiveness.\u201cI feel like it was all sincere,\u201d said Ms. Kanzaveli. \u201cHowever it didn\u2019t preclude [Mr. McClure] from acting inappropriately. It\u2019s conflicting and puzzling.\u201dMs. Kanzaveli added that after learning about Mr. McClure\u2019s behavior she was, after all, not surprised, given her own experiences as a female founder and knowing how common sexual misconduct is in the tech industry.Several people said they believe that 500 Startups, which was managing more than $330 million of committed capital as of March, has outgrown Mr. McClure and can persist in its positive mission without him.Freada Kapor Klein and Mr. Kapor issued a statement saying they \u201cwill be engaged as limited partners to make sure that the underrepresented founders, partners and employees of 500 Startups are able to go forward with their work.\u201dMs. McDermott said she, too, would likely continue investing with 500 Startups as it carries on without Mr. McClure.\u201cHe failed as a leader, he failed the 500 family, he failed his investors,\u201d Ms. McDermott said. \u201cEven with Dave\u2019s failures, 500 has been funding women for years...They still accomplished a goal to make venture capital much more inclusive.\u201d\u2014Cat Zakrzewski contributed to this article.Write to Yuliya Chernova at yuliya.chernova@wsj.com Twitter: @ychernova", "news_time": "2017-07-07 07:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/500-startups-mission-for-women-takes-a-hit-1499427001", "news_title": "500 Startups\u2019 Mission for Women Takes a Hit", "keywords": "diversity in tech,gender equality,women in tech,500 Startups,Personalized Beauty Discovery,corporate funding,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,small business start-up capital,small,medium businesses,workplace discrimination,workplace diversity,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,discrimination,harassment,human rights,civil liberties,sex crimes,social issues,women's rights,analyses,commentaries,opinions,venture capital"}, {"content": "MOSCOW\u2014Russia is willing to consider any proposals concerning the deal among top oil producers to cut output, including possible adjustments to its parameters, the country\u2019s energy ministry said.\u201cRussia at the moment considers the initiative effective and that it facilitated a reduction in global commercial oil reserves and stabilization of the oil markets,\u201d Russian news agencies cited an unnamed ministry official as saying.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, cut production from the start of this year to support prices.

Today, other companies such as             Microsoft Corp.       and Uber Technologies Inc. are experimenting with the technology.The problem differential privacy tries to tackle stems from the fact that modern data-analysis tools are capable of finding links between large databases. Privacy experts worry these tools could be used to identify people in otherwise anonymous data sets.Two years ago, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology discovered shoppers could be identified by linking social-media accounts to anonymous credit-card records and bits of secondary information, such as the location or timing of purchases.\u201dI don\u2019t think people are aware of how easy it is getting to de-anonymize data,\u201d said       Ishaan Nerurkar,        whose startup LeapYear Technologies Inc. sells software for leveraging machine learning while using differential privacy to keep user data anonymous.Differentially private algorithms blur the data being analyzed by adding a measurable amount of statistical noise. This could be done, for example, by swapping out one question (have you ever committed a violent crime?) with a question that has a statistically known response rate (were you born in February?). Someone trying to find links in the data would never be sure which question a particular person was asked. That lets researchers analyze sensitive data such as medical records without being able to tie the data back to specific people.Differential privacy is key to Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence efforts, said       Abhradeep Guha Thakurta,        an assistant professor at University of California, Santa Cruz. Mr. Thakurta worked on Apple\u2019s differential-privacy systems until January of this year.Apple has faced criticism for not keeping pace with rivals such as             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google in developing AI technologies, as they have made giant leaps in image and language recognition software that powers virtual assistants and self-driving cars.While companies such as Google have access to massive volumes of data required to improve artificial intelligence, Apple\u2019s privacy policies have been a hindrance, blamed by some for turning the company into a laggard when it comes to AI-driven products such as Siri.\u201dApple has tried to stay away from collecting data from users until now, but to succeed in the AI era they have to collect information about the user,\u201d Mr. Thakurta said. Apple began rolling out the differential-privacy software in September, he said.Users must elect to share analytics data with Apple before it is used.Originally used to understand how customers are using emojis or new slang expressions on the phone, Apple is now expanding its use of differential privacy to cover its collection and analysis of web browsing and health-related data,       Katie Skinner,        an Apple software engineer, said at the company\u2019s annual developer\u2019s conference in June.The company is now receiving millions of pieces of information daily\u2014all protected via this technique\u2014from Macs, iPhones and iPads running the latest operating systems, she said.\u201cApple believes that great features and privacy go hand in hand,\u201d an Apple spokesman said via email.Google, one of differential privacy\u2019s earliest adopters, has used it to keep Chrome browser data anonymous. But while the technology is good for some types of analysis, it suffers where precision is required. For example, experts at Google say it doesn\u2019t work in so-called A/B tests, in which two versions of a webpage are tested on a small number of users to see which generates the best response.\u201dIn some cases you simply can\u2019t answer the questions that developers want answers to,\u201d said       Yonatan Zunger,        a privacy engineer at Google. \u201cWe basically see differential privacy as a useful tool in the toolbox, but not a silver bullet.\u201dResearchers are coming up with \u201csurprisingly powerful\u201d uses of differential privacy, but the technology is only about a decade old, said       Benjamin Pierce,        a computer science professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWe\u2019re really far from understanding what the limits are,\u201d he said.Differential privacy has seen wider adoption since Apple first embraced it. Uber employees, for example, use it to improve services without being overexposed to user data, a spokeswoman said via email.Microsoft is working with San Diego Gas & Electric Co. on a pilot project to make smart-meter data available to researchers and government agencies for analysis, while making sure \u201cany data set cannot be tied back to our customers,\u201d said       Chris Vera,        head of customer privacy at the utility.The U.S. Census Bureau confronted the problem of links between data sets a decade ago. By 2005, the bureau was worried large databases outside its control could be used to de-anonymize census participants, said       John Abowd,        chief scientist at the bureau. After meeting with some of the creators of differential privacy, the bureau became a proponent.In 2008 the Census released its first product to use this technology\u2014a web-based data-mapping portal called OnTheMap\u2014and the bureau is now \u201cmaking an intense effort to apply differential privacy to the publication of the 2020 census,\u201d Mr. Abowd said.Write to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.comAppeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'Apple Tries to Fence Off User Data.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-expands-bet-on-cutting-edge-privacy-technology-1499425201", "news_title": "Apple Expands Bet on Cutting Edge Privacy Technology ", "keywords": "Apple,AAPL,Alphabet Inc.

The increase paled next to May\u2019s $24.03 billion gain and was smaller than the $11 billion rise forecast by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.China\u2019s foreign-exchange regulator attributed June\u2019s pickup in part to the dollar\u2019s weaker value, which raised the valuation of other currencies in the reserves, and to the \u201csteady supply and demand for foreign currency.\u201dEconomists said the rise in value of other currencies in the reserves helped to balance out a decline in the prices of U.S. and Japanese government bonds. They also cited the tightened capital controls imposed late last year to stem an outflow of money as another factor in the June increase and said investors are now divided on whether the yuan would rise or fall in value against the dollar.\u201cMarket expectations on the yuan have started to diverge lately after Beijing won some success this year in curbing capital outflows and stabilizing the Chinese currency,\u201d said       Larry Hu,        an economist with Macquarie Research.After burning through nearly $320 billion of its foreign-exchange hoard last year to keep the yuan from depreciating too rapidly, China\u2019s central bank has made stabilizing the currency a top priority and closed off channels for businesses and individuals to send money out of the country.In its latest move to change tactics and keep traders guessing about the yuan\u2019s value, the central bank in May tweaked its mechanism for setting the currency\u2019s daily rate against the dollar. The addition of what it called the \u201ccounter-cyclical\u201d factor gave the bank greater control in setting the daily reference rate and sent a message to investors that the bank is committed to a stronger yuan, economists said.Meanwhile, the central bank also intervened in the offshore market for the yuan, which is centered in Hong Kong, by jacking up borrowing costs for the currency and thereby making it more expensive to bet on the yuan\u2019s depreciation.As a result, many analysts have recently revised their forecasts for the yuan, with some now predicting a smaller decline or even a gain this year.Macquarie\u2019s Mr. Hu said that even if the yuan ends up depreciating against the dollar this year, Beijing has regained control over the cross-border capital flows.\u201cThe real problem now is how to withdraw from its current interventions and capital controls without triggering a flood of outflows,\u201d said Mr. Hu.\u2014Grace Zhu", "news_time": "2017-07-07 06:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-forex-reserves-rise-for-fifth-straight-month-1499415329", "news_title": "China\u2019s Forex Reserves Rise for Fifth Straight Month", "keywords": "china central bank,china forex reserves,china yuan,chinese economy,foreign exchange reserves,people's bank of china,yuan,economic performance,indicators,reserve assets,monetary policy,central bank intervention,economic news,money,currency markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "Sign up: With one click, get this newsletter delivered to your inbox.Fleet owners are cautiously stepping up their investment in new heavy-duty trucks. Orders for new Class 8 trucks resumed growing last month after a late-spring pause, WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Jennifer Smith writes, putting equipment makers back on track for expanding production this year. Industry analysts say normal truck ordering cycles have been disrupted over the past two years, as companies first pulled back amid a slowdown in industrial shipping demand and then scaled orders back up at the start of 2017 in anticipation of a surge in the economy. Confidence in areas such as infrastructure investment has faded, but the long lull in buying may have big companies anxious to refresh their fleets and trends in the freight market may be pushing truckers to act. Spot rates have been rising and analyst group Stifel says contract rates appear to have stabilized amid a \u201csolid end\u201d to the second quarter.It\u2019s not only the owners of brick-and-mortar stores that are being jolted by changing consumer shopping trends. Longtime rivals QVC and the             Home Shopping Network                   are merging as two retailers built around cable television adapt to a world where customer habits and demands are shifting. The home-shopping channels don\u2019t face the same pressures as chains with retail stores, the WSJ\u2019s Suzanne Kapner writes, but they are increasingly competing for consumer dollars with             Amazon.com Inc.       and seeing their business model shaken. The impulse buying that QVC and HSN depend on is moving to smartphones, threatening to break the ties the channels have with their customers, and ecommerce companies are getting consumers more accustomed to rapid deliveries that pressure retail margins. Combining the companies into one business with $14 billion in annual sales will give them bigger scale to invest in digital technology\u2014and more weight with shipping and fulfillment providers.A growing amount of American oil is winding up in Chinese refineries, in a reversal of the usual flow of goods between the two economic superpowers. China imported nearly 100,000 barrels of crude a day from the U.S. in the first five months of the year, a tenfold increase over the same period in 2016, the WSJ\u2019s Brian Spegele reports. It\u2019s a simple story of supply and demand: a federal ban on oil exports was loosened in 2015, unleashing U.S. crude onto the global market just as China was looking for new oil sources to replace falling production from its own aging fields. China is also an increasingly important buyer of plastic pellets produced in plants along the U.S. Gulf Coast, another example of how the shale boom is reshaping global supply chains. Chinese demand could dry up just as quickly as it\u2019s emerged, however, if Middle Eastern producers cut prices to win back market share lost to U.S. competitors.The car-sales slowdown is rippling across different parts of the automotive supply chain. Auto-parts retailer             O\u2019Reilly Automotive Inc.       saw its same-store sales growth fall far behind expectations in its second quarter, the WSJ\u2019s Justina Vasquez reports, sending its share price to its lowest level since late 2014 and signaling the auto-industry slump may be spreading beyond the car makers. The company cited weak consumer demand and mild winter weather that left car owners looking for fewer repairs. The weakness in the retail parts business follows new reports of slowing sales for U.S. auto makers, where strong demand had bolstered the U.S. industrial economy for several years. In O\u2019Reilly\u2019s case, same-store sales rose 1.7%. That was better than the declines that competitors             Advance Auto Parts Inc.       and             AutoZone Inc.       have reported, but it was well below the 4.3% growth rate O\u2019Reilly reported in the same quarter last year.\u2018There are some clear advantages to scale.

Numerous peace talks over the years have failed.Cyprus\u2019s President       Nicos Anastasiades       and Turkish Cypriot leader       Mustafa Akinci       are strong supporters of the island\u2019s reunification and have sought to generate international momentum for a deal since talks began in 2015.Mr. Guterres also raised hopes for a deal. According to diplomatic officials, the former prime minister of Portugal was well respected by all sides involved in the negotiations as he appeared to have a clear understanding of Mediterranean politics.As the latest negotiations headed toward the last and most-sensitive issues\u2014security arrangements and a military presence on the island\u2014hopes for a deal began to recede. \u201cThe ask was too big,\u201d one diplomat involved in the negotiations said.The summit lasted 10 days in the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana among the Cypriot leaders, the foreign ministers of Greece, Turkey and Britain\u2014the country\u2019s guarantor powers since 1960\u2014the U.N. and the EU.Turkey appeared to offer too little to the Greek Cypriots on the termination of the right of military intervention, the abolition of the guarantor treaty and the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island, according to Greek and Cypriot officials.Mr. Gutteres flew to Switzerland for the second time on Thursday in an attempt to bring all sides closer to a compromise. U.S. Vice President       Mike Pence       spoke over the phone with the two Cypriot leaders to urge them to \u201cseize this historic opportunity.\u201dCyprus government spokesman       Nikos Christodoulides       said \u201ctonight\u2019s development is in no way positive, but it is not the end of the road either.\u201d It was unclear whether reunification talks between the two sides could start again.\u201cThis outcome shows the impossibility of reaching a settlement within the parameters of the Good Offices Mission,\u201d Turkish Foreign Minister Mavlut Cavusoglu wrote on his twitter feed, using a term referring to the U.N. \u201cNo use in insisting on them.\u201dA deal could have delivered economic benefits, such as allowing the installation of natural-gas pipelines connecting Europe and the Middle East via the island and would give an economic and security boost in a troubled region.The start of offshore gas exploration drilling by French energy giant             Total SA       next week is likely to spur tensions between the two sides.Turkey, which is keen for Turkish Cypriots to have access to the reserves, has repeatedly threatened to mobilize its naval forces should Cyprus proceed unilaterally with drilling.Write to Nektaria Stamouli at nektaria.stamouli@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Greece, Turkey and Britain have been Cyprus\u2019s guarantor powers since 1960.

Speaking at the site of a memorial to a 1944 Polish uprising against the Nazis, Mr. Trump exhorted the West to recognize the existential peril embodied by terrorists who have struck repeatedly at centers of Western arts and culture. He also sought to provide an intellectual grounding for some of the controversial policies he has pushed since taking office: the travel ban, building a border wall and aggressive actions against illegal immigrants. Thursday\u2019s address had a loftier ring than the president\u2019s address in Saudi Arabia in May, when he said America\u2019s global role should be guided by what he called \u201cprincipled realism.\u201d Today Mr. Trump will meet for the first time with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway is buying one of the country\u2019s biggest power-transmission companies, Texas-based Oncor, cementing electricity as one of the conglomerate\u2019s largest businesses. Berkshire said it will buy Oncor\u2019s bankrupt owner, Energy Future Holdings Corp., for $9 billion in cash. As part of Berkshire, Oncor would expand the portfolio of Greg Abel, the 55-year-old chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Mr. Abel is considered a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Buffett as CEO of Berkshire. Oncor is owned by Energy Future, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2014. Mr. Buffett has dealt with Energy Future before, but his experience with the company wasn\u2019t a success.Big Food is in big trouble. For over a century, brands such as Kellogg\u2019s cereal, Campbell\u2019s soup and Aunt Jemima pancake mix filled pantries of American households that wanted safe, affordable and convenient food and provided companies with reliable revenue growth. Today, these giants are struggling with competition that is corroding business from both ends. High-end consumers are shifting toward fresher items with fewer processed ingredients while cost-conscious shoppers are buying inexpensive store brands. The pressure has set off soul searching in the industry as well as some dramatic restructuring.

The deal has been mired in controversy amid fraud allegations. The Austrian government this year said Airbus Chief Executive       Tom Enders      was among those being investigated as part of the corruption probe.Airbus has denied wrongdoing and said it was cooperating with authorities. It is one of several corruption probes Europe\u2019s largest aerospace company is battling.Suspicions of corruption were raised as early as 2002, before the contract was completed, but remained unsubstantiated until 2006, when a parliamentary committee in Vienna identified suspect payments apparently related to the sale. At the time, it had little evidence of the rationale behind the payments and investigations continued.Austrian defense minister       Hans Peter Doskozil       on Friday said in a statement that \u201cwe need to get the escalating costs of the Eurofighter under control and minimize the enormous cost risks associated with it\u2014in the interests of the taxpayer and also in relation to the other branches of the armed forces.\u201dAustria had been evaluating its combat aircraft plans with the pending retirement of the more-than 40-year old             Saab        SAABF -2.57%       105OE trainers also used for air surveillance.It had considered buying a replacement plane and upgrading the Eurofighter Typhoons to add combat capability. Austria has early versions of the plane that don\u2019t sport many of the capabilities other air forces such as the U.K. and Germany have in more modern versions of the plane.But the government has determined buying a replacement plane for both the Saab and the Eurofighter would be \u20ac100 million ($114.2 million) to \u20ac2 billion cheaper depending on which new plane it buys. Those savings estimates are based on a total cost including operations to 2049 and reflect the higher upfront cost involved in buying a new plane. Austria said it would now move to a single-plane type and buy 18 new supersonic jets, 15 single-seat planes and three dual-seaters.Airbus said the decision was one for the Austrian government. It added only that \u201cthe Eurofighter works very well for all other customers.\u201dThe new plane would be introduced in Austria in the 2020 to 2023 timeframe, an Austrian Defense Ministry official said. The government said it would start talking to potential bidders. Potential bidders could include             Boeing Co.       and             Lockheed Martin Corp.      , as well as Sweden\u2019s Saab AB and France\u2019s             Dassault Aviation.       A purchase decision isn\u2019t expected before next year.The potential order adds to a growing list of competitions in Europe for new combat planes.

The different types of firms worked together, under the observation of the telecommunications giant, to sketch out plans for how they might use data, technology and media to achieve specific marketing objectives, according to a person familiar with the event.The workshop was part of a larger effort, dubbed \u201cProject Tetris,\u201d to align the company\u2019s media operations with a quickly changing media strategy, including spending more with companies like             Facebook        FB 0.79%       and Google and exerting greater control over data.The German company, which controls wireless carrier             T-Mobile US Inc.,       may potentially divide its European media operation into six different groups, such as programmatic buying and media intelligence, and slice up agency duties to support those tasks, according to a copy of an agency review document obtained by The Wall Street Journal.A person familiar with the review said no decisions have been made yet.Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ\u2019s CMO Today newsletter. Sign up here.Deutsche Telekom is the latest company to rethink the structure of its media operation as technology changes the way people consume media, and as advertisers discover new technology and data resources to help them get their ads in front of customers.\u201cThe basic insight motivating a change in Deutsche Telekom\u2019s media operating model is that continuing with the current media model will lead to stagnation,\u201d the company states in the document. \u201cChanges in the market structure as well as internal developments demand changes in Deutsche Telekom\u2019s way of working if the group is to defend and strengthen its leadership position.\u201dIn the document, the company cites a need to attract consumers whose attention is shifting to mobile devices and away from traditional ads amid a \u201csteep rise in users installing ad blockers,\u201d as well as a need to outsmart the telecom competition that\u2019s \u201cinsourcing analytics and investing in advertising technology.\u201d\u201cIt is common business practice to review partners and suppliers,\u201d said a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom in an email. \u201cCurrently we are reviewing media partners within the context as a large advertiser within Europe.\u201dConsulting giant McKinsey and advertising consultant ID Comms have supported the company\u2019s media efforts.It isn\u2019t clear what impact the effort will have on the company\u2019s T-Mobile operations in the U.S., where wireless providers are engaged in a fierce pricing war.The change comes as large advertisers rapidly reallocate their media spend from traditional channels like TV and print, to digital firms like Facebook and Google. Global digital advertising spend is expected to increase by 14% this year, according to the latest ad forecast from media buying group Magna. In Western Europe, online advertising sales are expected to grow by an average of 10% to $42 billion.Deutsche Telekom, which spends hundreds of millions of dollars on media in Europe, according to someone familiar with the review, is no exception.Traditional TV, which accounts for about one-third of Deutsche Telekom\u2019s media spend, will decline \u201cslightly\u201d over the next few years, according to the review document. Print, out-of-home and radio will also decline \u201csharply,\u201d from about a third of the company\u2019s media spend. At the same time, the company plans on \u201csharply\u201d increasing spend on \u201cadvertising within walled gardens,\u201d like Facebook and YouTube, as well as programmatic advertising, including display and video ad formats in the coming years.In the document, the company also expressed an interest in reducing its reliance on third parties and suppliers, for \u201cmore control over media spend, data, placements and outcomes.\u201dCurrently, Deutsche Telekom\u2019s media operations are \u201clargely outsourced to agencies, with a low reliance on data, and limited internal collaboration.\u201dMedia agencies\u2014which typically support data and analytics, as well as traditional and digital media buying and planning, for a single client\u2014may now handle fewer and more specific tasks.The company invited             Omnicom,WPP                   and             Publicis                   to participate in the review.Write to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 06:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-telekom-considers-shaking-up-media-operations-1499421600", "news_title": "Deutsche Telekom Considers Shaking Up Media Operations", "keywords": "Deutsche Telekom,DTEGY,DTE.XE,Facebook,FB,plans,strategy,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,corporate restructuring,social media marketing,telecommunication services,wireless telecommunications services,mobile telecommunications,internet service providers (discontinued from 11th july 2017),internet search engines,public relations,business,consumer services,internet,online,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "ZURICH\u2014The yearslong battle that smaller European central banks have waged against their own strong currencies may have turned a corner, thanks to the strengthening euro.Increased confidence in the eurozone, both politically and economically, has raised the euro\u2019s value against a broad swath of big and small currencies, including some of its neighbors. Amid these improved prospects for Europe, central bankers in Switzerland, Denmark and the Czech Republic have dramatically scaled back their purchases of foreign currencies in recent months.The             Swiss National Bank\u2019s       foreign-exchange reserves\u2014accumulated on a massive scale since 2012\u2014dipped slightly last month to 693.5 billion Swiss francs ($721 billion), the SNB said Friday. The figures suggest the central bank has pulled back on its currency intervention efforts.Denmark hasn\u2019t intervened in markets since March, according to central bank data. Data from the Czech central bank showed currency intervention of just \u20ac653 million ($745 million) in April, down sharply from March.This is in contrast to the first quarter, when these banks cumulatively added tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of foreign currency to their balance sheets. By creating new Swiss francs, Danish kroner and Czech koruna and using them to buy foreign currency assets, these central banks hoped to weaken their own currencies and protect exporters while boosting inflation.Their ability to step back is a byproduct of the broader normalization occurring among big central banks. The Federal Reserve has raised rates twice this year and is expected to do so again before year-end. The European Central Bank has reduced its quantitative easing program, and officials have sounded more positive about the bloc\u2019s economic outlook, even though its deposit rate is still negative.This has the potential to reduce demand for assets in countries such as Switzerland, whose currencies tend to benefit amid uncertain times in the global economy.\u201cThe Danes and Swiss are all at the mercy of large central banks. Sometimes they lose, like when the ECB cut rates into negative territory and sometimes it works in their favor,\u201d as is the case more recently, said       Peter Rosenstreich,        head of market strategy at             Swissquote Bank.Switzerland has battled the strong franc since the euro crisis intensified in 2010, prompting its central bank to spend vast sums intervening and, eventually, setting a ceiling on the franc\u2019s strength in 2011. When it abandoned that cap in early 2015, it was forced to step up its intervention.Denmark, meanwhile, has a target range for the euro-kroner exchange rate. The Czech central bank had a euro target for a while, but dropped it in April.The euro traded at just under 1.10 Swiss francs early Friday, near a one-year high. The euro fetched 7.44 kroner\u2014which is near the middle of the Danish central bank\u2019s target range\u2014and 26.1 Czech koruna, just slightly weaker than when the koruna target was in place.A strong currency brings many economic benefits. It reflects the confidence global investors attach to assets of countries such as Switzerland, which is known as a haven. It raises purchasing power and may make key imported commodities like oil less expensive.But when it is too strong, the economy may slide into persistent consumer price declines known as deflation, which weakens consumption and investment. A strong currency also typically damps exports.And the exchange rate effects extend beyond exports and consumer prices. The Czech Republic is a key manufacturing hub in sectors like automobiles and thus benefits from low costs. Switzerland is home to global corporate powerhouses like             Nestl\u00e9 SA       and             Swatch Group AG       which generate a significant share of their revenue from overseas but report their earnings in francs.Switzerland\u2019s central bank \u201cis breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d said Mr. Rosenstreich.Write to Brian Blackstone at brian.blackstone@wsj.comAppeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'Euro Eases Franc\u2019s Strain.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 05:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-small-central-banks-finally-catch-a-break-from-euro-1499420158", "news_title": "Europe\u2019s Other Central Banks Catch Break From ECB, Euro", "keywords": "central bank intervention,currency cap,european central bank,forex,strong franc,swiss franc,swiss national bank,Czech central bank,European Central Bank,monetary policy,euro zone,currency,economic news,money,currency markets,money markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "Last year, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries conveniently predicted that in 2040, electric vehicles would make up just 6.7% of the car fleet. The owners of four-fifths of proven oil reserves also said the number of cars on the road would double.Right now, electric cars make up about 1% of sales in the U.S., Europe and China, though growing rapidly. But this week brought news from two quarters with the ability to shape that future in a way that OPEC can\u2019t: a mainstream auto manufacturer and a major government. Volvo says it will drop purely conventional engines by 2019 and France wants to ban the sale of conventionally-fueled vehicles by 2040.Government help already plays a role in electric vehicles\u2019 rapid growth. Making electric cars the only option, of course, could boost that to 100% of sales and, within another decade or two, 100% of all cars on the road.Yet consumer, and voter, preferences may get in the way.Success hinges largely on bringing down battery costs and extending range. For example,             General Motors                   surprised the industry when it said that its new Chevrolet Bolt\u2019s battery cost just $145 a kilowatt-hour. Even so, the Bolt costs about $30,000 after a $7,500 federal subsidy, or nearly twice the price of a comparably-sized, gasoline-powered Chevrolet Sonic.While electric cars are constrained by range and the lack of charging stations, America\u2019s ubiquitous gas stations, backed by 100,000 tanker trucks, 200,000 miles of pipeline and 200,000 railcars, dispense 40 million fill ups a day, according to The Association for Convenience & Fuel Retailing. Even with subsidies, there is still a sacrifice in terms of cost and convenience to going electric.If those constraints can be alleviated by continued progress in technology and infrastructure, then OPEC really will be in trouble in a couple of decades. If progress slows, or if subsidies become less generous, then auto manufacturers and politicians with green ambitions will have egg on their faces.Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/electric-cars-need-more-than-fans-1499419802", "news_title": "Electric Cars Need More Than Fans", "keywords": " car sales, crude oil,electric cars, gas engines, gasoline, opec,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,energy,motor vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive"}, {"content": "Activist investor Elliott Management Corp said Friday it was seeking to remove Akzo Nobel Chairman       Antony Burgmans       because of the board\u2019s handling of the failed $27.6 billion bid from             PPG Industries Inc.        PPG 0.58%Citing shareholder dissatisfaction, a unit of Elliott has filed a joint petition to the Interim Relief Court in the Netherlands to convene a general meeting of shareholders to vote on the dismissal of Mr. Burgmans.Elliott owns 9.5% of the Dutch paint and chemical giant\u2019s issued share capital. It said a recent survey that it requested showed that shareholders holding 21% of shares didn\u2019t have confidence in the management board, compared with 4% that do. It also said shareholders holding 32% of shares weren\u2019t satisfied with the way Akzo\u2019s boards conducted themselves over the PPG approach, compared with 0.2% who were happy. The survey was conducted by proxy advisory firm Georgeson.For its part, Elliott said it had lost confidence in the ability of the chairman to guide Akzo in a manner that benefits all of its stakeholders.Elliott was a key player in trying to end a standoff between Akzo and PPG, two of the world\u2019s oldest industrial companies. As one of Akzo\u2019s largest investors, Elliott mounted a bold public-relations and legal campaign to try to force the Amsterdam-based company into sale talks with U.S. peer PPG.The New York hedge fund has a history of agitating for European mergers and its London office has taken stakes in several companies and either pushed them to agree to a sale or forced a bidder to pay more.In its rejection, Akzo said the bid from PPG substantially undervalued the company and carried \u201csignificant delivery and timing risk for shareholders, both in relation to substantial antitrust issues, pension schemes and the achievability of proposed synergies.\u201dIn May, Elliott lost an earlier legal battle to remove Mr. Burgmans.

He called for more economic cooperation and a resumption of reunions between families separated during the Korean War in the early 1950s.\u201cThe basic conditions have been met to restart the Korean Peninsula peace process,\u201d Mr. Moon said, in his clearest statement on inter-Korean engagement since taking office in May.The venue for the speech, which came ahead of a Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, was symbolic: Germany\u2019s reunification in 1990 has long served as a reference point on the divided Korean Peninsula, where many harbor hopes that the two Koreas might eventually be reunited.\u201cI am ready to meet with Chairman Kim Jong Un of North Korea at any time, at any place, if the conditions are met and if it will provide an opportunity to transform the tension and confrontation on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Mr. Moon said.His message could chafe with that of U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe,        with whom he dined on Thursday in Hamburg. Messrs. Trump and Abe have demanded harsher punishments on North Korea in response to its recent missile tests.After the regime\u2019s launch of an ICBM on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       called for further isolation of North Korea, adding that any country providing it with an economic benefit is \u201caiding and abetting a dangerous regime.\u201dIn his speech, Mr. Moon called Pyongyang\u2019s missile test \u201can outright rejection of the repeated warnings by the international community,\u201d and a \u201cvery disappointing and a largely wrong decision,\u201d according to an unofficial translation supplied by his government.\u201cIf North Korea does not stop its nuclear provocations, there is no other choice but to further strengthen sanctions and pressure,\u201d he said, but added that his hope of reopening inter-Korean dialogue has the support of Mr. Trump and a \u201cconsensus\u201d with Chinese President       Xi Jinping.Mr. Moon proposed reconnecting train lines from South Korea through North Korea to Russia and Europe. He raised the idea of a gas pipeline linking the two Koreas and Russia, part of a \u201cnew economic map for the Korean Peninsula.\u201dInter-Korean family reunions, which have been held sporadically, should be resumed in October on humanitarian grounds, he said. He invited North Koreans to visit their hometowns and ancestral graves in the South.North Korea rejected an earlier offer by the Moon administration to restart family reunions, demanding that the South first agree to turn over a group of North Korean restaurant workers who defected to Seoul last year. Pyongyang says they were kidnapped by the South.Mr. Moon said he is inheriting the efforts of previous left-leaning presidents, who in 2000 and 2007 met with then-North Korean leader       Kim Jong Il       in Pyongyang. Those summits had put the Korean Peninsula on \u201ca path of reconciliation and cooperation,\u201d he said.Mr. Moon said Germany\u2019s reunification underscored the importance of peace and cooperation based on mutual respect. He said Germans \u201cmade the decision of unification by themselves\u201d\u2014echoing calls by North Korea and many in the South that Korean reunification should be settled without interference by outsiders, including the U.S.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.comAppeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'South Calls for Talks With Pyongyang.'", "news_time": "2017-07-07 05:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korean-leader-says-hes-ready-to-meet-kim-jong-un-1499419233", "news_title": "South Korean Leader Says He\u2019s Ready to Meet Kim Jong Un", "keywords": "inter-korean relations,korean peninsula,north korea icbm,north korea missile,north korea nuclear,north korea sanctions,north korea weapons,Shinzo Abe,Kim Jong Un,Donald Trump,political,general news,national,public security,international relations,politics,domestic politics,risk news,government bodies,executive branch,military action"}, {"content": "TOKYO\u2014Japan\u2019s central bank stepped in to tame a rise in government-bond yields on Friday, signaling its determination to stick to its current policy mix, even as the recent selloff in global bond markets intensifies.The Bank of Japan\u2019s increased intervention in the markets came after the yield on the country\u2019s benchmark 10-year government bond rose earlier in the day to 0.105%, its highest since Feb. 3. The central bank\u2019s target is 0%. Bond yields rise as their prices fall.The yield on the 10-year government bond later slipped back to 0.085%, after the BOJ said it would buy an unlimited amount of government bonds maturing in five to 10 years at a yield equivalent to 0.110% and raised the amount the amount of bonds it said it would buy at a regularly scheduled auction.The Japanese central bank\u2019s display of determination to prop up domestic bond prices came after the yield on benchmark German government bonds, known as bunds, rose overnight to its highest level in 18 months, 0.57%, and U.S. Treasury yields continued their recent climb. The bond selloff spilled into Asia on Friday, with yields on benchmark 10-year government bonds rising in Korea, Australia and Indonesia.The trigger for government-bond market declines has been talk among leading central bankers suggesting that years of easy monetary policy designed to stimulate struggling economies may be coming to an end. While the Federal Reserve is considering further interest-rate increases this year, the European Central Bank has been signaling that it is getting ready to wind down its stimulus efforts after years of huge bond buying.The situation in Japan is still somewhat different. While the U.S. has been recording solid growth and European officials appear ever more confident that economic recovery there is taking root, Japan\u2019s central bank has remained cautious. That is despite some encouraging signs: Japanese base wages grew at their fastest pace in more than 17 years in May, rising by 0.9% on-year.Japanese policy makers have been yearning for evidence of better pay growth, which they hope will stimulate higher consumer demand. But the recent uptick likely isn\u2019t enough to push Japanese inflation up to the central bank\u2019s 2.0% target. Consumer-price inflation rose at a 0.4% annual rate in May.If the BOJ keeps to its inflation target, the market \u201ccannot expect it to exit its stimulus program anytime soon,\u201d said Shuichi Ohsaki, rates strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo.Japan\u2019s central bank has said little about giving up on the program of huge bond buying it introduced four years ago. The BOJ\u2019s official target is to buy 80 trillion yen ($703 billion) in government bonds each year. It already owns 40% of the country\u2019s outstanding government bonds.\u201cI\u2019m not thinking of deciding in advance how we would change the pace of bond purchases,\u201d BOJ Gov.       Haruhiko Kuroda       said last month.Even so, the central bank has eased its bond buying in recent months, leading some analysts to say it is \u201ctechnically tapering.\u201d At the current rate of purchases, it may only buy around 55 trillion yen\u2019s worth this year, according to J.P. Morgan estimates. The reduction had led some observers to suggest the BOJ might soon raise its target yield for 10-year government bonds to as high as 0.2%, meaning that it would be able to reduce its bond purchases further.Yet the Bank of Japan\u2019s decision on Friday to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds to keep yields from rising too far suggests analysts may have been getting ahead of themselves.\u201cThey sent a clear message that they are still going to stick to this range target of 0.1% and they will do whatever they can do to keep it,\u201d said Naka Matsuzawa, Japan rates strategist with Nomura Securities.If anything, the Bank of Japan\u2019s determination to keep a lid on bond yields appears to have hardened. In February, it took similar steps to increase its bond buying but only when the yield on the 10-year tenor had risen as high as 0.150%.At or near the top of the list of complicating factors for the Bank of Japan is the yen. Japanese policy makers have long been eager to prevent the country\u2019s currency from becoming too strong against the dollar and other major currencies, fearing the harm that might do to Japan\u2019s exporting giants.After the BOJ\u2019s actions Friday, the greenback gained 0.5% against the yen, meaning one dollar now buys 113.80 yen.Still, policy makers may be reluctant to let the yen slide indefinitely. A much weaker yen could weigh on importers, eroding consumer spending power for products such as gasoline and clothing.Some analysts say that by keeping yields around zero, the central bank risks driving bond prices higher than they otherwise would be. In turn, that could lead to losses for the central bank when it looks to exit its stimulus program.\u201cThis makes them vulnerable to criticism about, \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 and \u2018It is costing the nation,\u2019\u201d Nomura\u2019s Mr. Matsuzawa said.\u2014Saumya Vaishampayan and Yoko Kubota contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-07-07 04:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-japan-punches-down-bond-yields-1499417998", "news_title": "Bank of Japan Punches Down Bond Yields ", "keywords": "bank of japan,bank of japan policy, bond yields, central banks, japanese government bonds, jgb, monetary policy,Bank of Japan,German government,monetary policy,central bank intervention,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014U.K. industrial production shrank unexpectedly in May, data showed, as manufacturing output declined and warm temperatures reduced demand for energy, signaling economic growth failed to pick up in the second quarter after a sluggish start to the year.In monthly terms, production shrank 0.1% in May, according to Office for National Statistics data published Friday, disappointing the expectations of analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal, who forecast 0.3% growth.Factory output fell by 0.2% on the month, against analysts\u2019 expectations of 0.3% growth.The fall in manufacturing output was driven largely by a decrease in production of transport equipment, as well as a declining food, beverages and tobacco production.Compared with the same month last year, industrial output was down 0.2%, missing market expectations of 0.2% growth. Annual growth in manufacturing also disappointed, with factory output growing by a mere 0.4%, 0.5 points less than forecast.Separately, the ONS said the U.K.\u2019s trade deficit in goods widened in May, and stood at \u00a311.9 billion ($15.4 billion), up from \u00a310.6 billion the previous month and nearly a billion more than expected by analysts.As accelerating inflation squeezes consumer spending-for years a key engine of U.K. growth-economists say that production and trade will have to make a bigger contribution to stave off an economic slowdown.The quarterly economic growth in the first three months of the year stood at 0.2%, significantly below the 0.7% quarterly rate seen in the last quarter of 2016.Write to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com and Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-07 04:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/british-industrial-output-falls-unexpectedly-1499417444", "news_title": "British Industrial Output Falls Unexpectedly", "keywords": "brexit,british economy,economic indicator,industrial production,uk economy,Office for National Statistics,output,production,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,economic news"}, {"content": "TACLOBAN, Philippines\u2014Part of the central Philippines was without power Friday a day after a strong earthquake struck the area, triggering landslides and leaving at least two people dead.The army sent soldiers and engineers to villages where roads were reportedly impassable after the quake.The 6.5-magnitude temblor Thursday afternoon was centered in Leyte province at a shallow depth, which often can cause greater surface damage.
