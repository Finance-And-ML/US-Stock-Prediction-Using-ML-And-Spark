The Jordanian and Kuwaiti airlines join Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airline, which each last week announced a lifting of the ban. In March, the United States banned laptops and other large electronic devices on flights originating at 10 airports in eight countries -- Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey -- to tackle fears that bombs could be concealed in them. Royal Jordanian, which flies to New York, Chicago and Detroit from Amman, Jordan, lifted the ban after new security measures were adopted for U.S.-bound flights, airline President Stefan Pichler said in a statement on Sunday. State-owned Kuwait Airways, which flies from Kuwait to New York via Ireland, said the ban was lifted after U.S. officials inspected security measures on its flights.  U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) spokesman Mike England said in an email the bans were lifted after Amman and Kuwait airports  implemented the required initial enhanced security measures.  The United States announced enhanced security measures on June 29, requiring additional time to screen passengers and electronic devices for possible explosives. The new U.S. measures, which take effect within three weeks of the announcement, will affect around 325,000 passengers a day traveling on 180 airlines from 280 airports around the world, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Airlines that fail to meet the new requirements could still face in-cabin restrictions on electronic devices. Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) has said it expects the ban to be lifted on flights from Jeddah and Riyadh by July 19. Royal Air Maroc also believes it can have the ban lifted for flights out of Casablanca's Mohammed V International Airport by July 19, a senior official from the state-owned airline told Reuters on July 6. State-owned EgyptAir has also been affected by the ban. Editing by Catherine Evans and Clarence Fernandez","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-airlines-electronics-jordan-idUSKBN19U0OV"},

The proposed deal is the latest in wave of mergers and acquisitions in global container shipping that has left the top six shipping lines controlling 63 percent of the market. OOIL's shipping subsidiary, OOCL, has a 2.7 percent slice of the market.  COSCO Shipping is offering HK$78.67 for each OOIL share, a premium of 37.8 percent over OOIL's closing price of HK$57.10 on its last trading date, the companies said in filings with the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges on Sunday. OOIL's controlling shareholders had on Friday agreed to sell their 68.7 percent stake at that price to COSCO Shipping, which is making the offer with Shanghai Port International Group (SIPG) (600018.SS) that will take 9.9 percent, they said.  COSCO Shipping will have a fleet of more than 400 vessels and capacity exceeding 2.9 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) should the deal go through, it said. This would make it the world's third largest container shipping line after Denmark's Maersk Line MAERSKb.Co and Switzerland's Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), according to Singapore-based transport research firm Crucial Perspective. It is currently the fourth-largest behind France's CMA CGM [CMACG.UL].  COSCO Shipping Holdings believes this acquisition will enable both COSCO Shipping Lines and OOIL to realize synergies, enhance profitability and achieve sustainable growth in the long term,  the Chinese group said in the statement.  A COSCO container is seen at the Noatum container terminal near Bilboa, in Santurtzi, Spain June 14, 2017.Vincent West - RTS170T5OOCL was founded in 1969 by Hong Kong shipping magnate Tung Chao-yung, whose son, Tung Chee-chen is chairman, president and chief executive of the company, while several Tung children are in senior management roles. The two companies in January dismissed merger rumors but analysts said that OOCL was still a likely bid target due to its long profitable history and relatively low leverage. Both firms are also part of the  Ocean Alliance  partnership, which also includes CMA CGM and Evergreen Marine Corp (2603.TW), that was formed last year to take on the rival grouping of Maersk Line and MSC. COSCO Shipping itself was created from the state-driven merger of former rivals China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company and China Shipping Group. Shares in the firm, which flagged a return to first-half profit last week, have been suspended since May 16. It said it would finance its part of the deal through external debt financing and that the transaction was still subject to anti-trust reviews by Chinese and U.S. government authorities.  The companies said that they plan to retain OOIL's listing status and maintain its global headquarters and presence in Hong Kong to support the city as a global maritime center.  Should the deal fall through, COSCO Shipping has also agreed to pay OOIL a reverse termination fee of $253 million, they said  UBS AG Hong Kong Branch (UBSG.S) is advising COSCO Shipping and SIPG, while J.P. Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Limited (JPM.N) is advising OOIL.

Wells Fargo has set aside that money to compensate customers who are part of a class-action lawsuit involving claims regarding consumer or small business bank accounts, credit cards or loans, as well as identity theft protection, between May 2002 and April of this year. It plans to begin reaching out to those affected customers soon. In the  unlikely event  that there are so many claims, and there is not $25 million left over to distribute across all customers involved in the lawsuit, Wells Fargo said it will pay more. The bank reached the settlement in April, according to a regulatory filing, but the judge's preliminary approval moves the deal to the next step. Wells Fargo has previously said thousands of branch employees created as many as 2.1 million bank and credit card accounts in individuals' names without their permission to artificially hit sales goals. Lawyers representing the claimants said 3.5 million accounts were created, according to a May 12 story by the Los Angeles Times. If U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria grants final approval to  the deal, it could help Wells Fargo chip away at a bevy of legal and regulatory issues stemming from the scandal, which erupted in September after it reached a $185 million settlement with a Los Angeles prosecutor and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Wells still faces probes from federal, state and local government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as a number of private lawsuits, according to its quarterly securities filing in May. In a statement, the bank's chief executive, Tim Sloan, said he was  pleased  that the court approved the preliminary settlement and considered it  a major milestone in our efforts to make things right for our customers.

The result is also particularly surprising given recent signs of an upswing in momentum. It suggests policymakers will have their work cut out in their quest to foster sustainable growth - especially if businesses show reluctance to invest, though some analysts caution against reading too much into the weak numbers.  Core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, dropped 3.6 percent in May from the previous month, Cabinet Office data showed on Monday. It was the steepest month-on-month decline since August 2016, and sharply undershot the 1.7 percent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. In April, they declined 3.1 percent. Core orders from the services sector fell 5.1 percent, down for a third straight month, dragged by declines in orders from transportation firms for computer systems and railway cars, and from telecommunications and construction industries.  Orders from manufacturers rose 1.0 percent in May from the previous month, up for a fourth straight month, led by gains in orders for turbines and boilers. The government cut its assessment of machinery orders for the first time since September 2016, saying they are stalling, in a worrying sign businesses may be turning cautious on investing.  Machinery orders probably won't be very strong (in the coming months),  a Cabinet Office official said.

Miyamae said it was surprising that orders declined from sectors such as transportation, postal and construction, which have been hit by labor shortages. Pinch of Salt However, some analysts say the Monday's data should be taken with a pinch of salt.  Machinery orders are volatile...it's better to look at the BOJ tankan in this case,  said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. The BOJ tankan, a closely-watched central bank survey, showed that big firms plan to raise their capital spending by 8.0 percent in the current fiscal year to March 2018.  Confidence among Japan's big manufacturers hit its highest level in more than three years in the June quarter, the survey also showed. Indeed, recent data suggested momentum was picking up, though it wasn't clear if the economic recovery was broadening out, with industrial output falling faster in May than at any time since the devastating earthquake of March 2011.   Japanese policymakers hope capital spending will help revitalize the world's third-largest economy and pull it out of years of deflation and stagnation. Speaking shortly after the machinery orders results were released, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated the central bank's resolve to maintain its massive stimulus program until inflation is stably above its 2 percent target. He also said inflation is likely to gradually accelerate towards 2 percent reflecting improvements in the economy.

The benchmark Australian index snapped three sessions of losses to gain 0.7 percent, or 39.23 points, to 5,742.80 by 0213 GMT. The index lost 0.3 percent last week, while shedding nearly 1 percent on Friday. Wall Street stocks ended higher on Friday after U.S. Labour Department data showed the world's biggest economy added 222,000 jobs last month, exceeding expectations of an addition of 179,000. While the robust jobs data puts the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates once more this year, subdued wage growth may give the central bank room to pause if needed.  Markets are reacting positively to the data. Australian shares are tracking Wall Street which posted gains on Friday after strong employment data boosted confidence in the U.S. economy,  said senior analyst Adam Tout at CPS Capital in Perth. Financial stocks, tracking profits in U.S. peers, were the biggest gainers on the benchmark. The 'Big Four' Australian banks were the top performers by weight, rising between 0.6 percent and 1 percent. The consumer cyclicals and durables sectors also contributed handily to the overall gains, with retailing giants Woolworths and Wesfarmers rising 1.2 percent and 0.5 percent respectively. The local tech sector too mirrored a rise in U.S. peers, with online property consultant REA Group up 0.7 percent. At the other end, basic materials wound up as the only losing sector as base metals prices saw some weakness, while iron ore prices rose. The most-traded iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange gained on Friday after port data from Australia showed iron ore shipments to China from Australia's Port Hedland terminal dropped to 36.6 million tonnes in June from 38 million tonnes the month before. Port Hedland is used by three of Australia's top four iron ore miners, BHP Billiton, Fortescue Metals Group and Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting. Fortescue and BHP were down about 0.4 percent each, while Rio Tinto was flat. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index rose marginally, adding 0.1 percent, or 9.71 points, at 7,631.84, as gains in financial and technology stocks offset losses in consumer shares. Accounting software maker Xero Ltd was the biggest gainer on the benchmark by weight, up 2 percent.

But while the attention has been elsewhere, the German has quietly made it into the fourth round where she faces a stern test on Monday against 14th-seeded Spaniard Garbine Muguruza. The lack of hype around Kerber is a reflection of the poor form she displayed coming into the grasscourt season, in particular her showing at the French Open. The 29-year-old suffered a humiliating first-round exit at Roland Garros, losing to 40th-ranked Ekaterina Makarova and becoming the first top seed to be eliminated from the tournament at the first hurdle in the professional era. She was also forced to withdraw from a warm-up event in Birmingham last month due to a hamstring injury, further lowering expectations for Wimbledon. Kerber, runner-up to Serena Williams last year, hardly looked back to her best in straight-sets wins over Irina Falconi and Kirsten Flipkens and she was in real danger in the third round where she battled back from a set and a break down to defeat American Shelby Rogers. The German conceded it had been tough for her to find her rhythm and that it was a fighting spirit that had got her through -  But that probably won't be enough against Muguruza. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 8, 2017   Spain’s Garbine Muguruza in action during her third round match against Romania’s Sorana CirsteaStefan Wermuth I think I have to play good tennis from the first point against her. I have to be aggressive, as well, and try to play my game from the first ball that we hit,  Kerber said.  It's a completely different match than the last three matches I had here . Muguruza has won her last four matches against Kerber, including a third-round victory at Wimbledon in 2015, where she went on to reach the final which she lost to Serena Williams. The Venezuela-born 23-year-old has also been in top form at this year's championships, reaching the second week without dropping a set. She was dominant in a 6-2 6-2 third-round win over Romanian Sorana Cirstea but while her recent record and form make her the favorite against Kerber, Muguruza knows she will have to be at her best.  I think when you play top players, first of all you [have] got to have your best level,  she said.   I think I kind of found a good level, good shots, good serve, playing against her. I played a lot of times against her, and I know her game. But nothing changes.   I had tough matches with people that were not in the top, top level. Then you play people in the top level.

Wells Fargo has set aside that money to compensate customers who are part of a class-action lawsuit involving claims regarding consumer or small business bank accounts, credit cards or loans, as well as identity theft protection, between May 2002 and April of this year. It plans to begin reaching out to those affected customers soon. In the  unlikely event  that there are so many claims, and there is not $25 million left over to distribute across all customers involved in the lawsuit, Wells Fargo said it will pay more. The bank reached the settlement in April, according to a regulatory filing, but the judge's preliminary approval moves the deal to the next step. Wells Fargo has previously said thousands of branch employees created as many as 2.1 million bank and credit card accounts in individuals' names without their permission to artificially hit sales goals. Lawyers representing the claimants said 3.5 million accounts were created, according to a May 12 story by the Los Angeles Times. If U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria grants final approval to  the deal, it could help Wells Fargo chip away at a bevy of legal and regulatory issues stemming from the scandal, which erupted in September after it reached a $185 million settlement with a Los Angeles prosecutor and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Wells still faces probes from federal, state and local government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as a number of private lawsuits, according to its quarterly securities filing in May. In a statement, the bank's chief executive, Tim Sloan, said he was  pleased  that the court approved the preliminary settlement and considered it  a major milestone in our efforts to make things right for our customers.  If the agreement receives final approval the bank expects it will close out the vast majority of claims in 10 class action lawsuits related to the one it is trying to settle.

His statements about Syria really disturb me. No, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin does not have it right when it comes to Syria,  Senator Lindsey Graham said. In separate television interviews, Graham and Senator John McCain, prominent Republican foreign policy voices, took aim at Tillerson's remarks last week that Russia may have  got the right approach  and the United States the wrong approach to Syria. Russia has backed President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war, while the United States supports rebel groups trying to overthrow him. McCain told CBS'  Face the Nation  that he  sometimes  regretted backing Tillerson's nomination by Republican President Donald Trump and that his comments on Russia being  right  on Syria made him emotional and upset.  I know what the slaughter has been like. I know that the Russians knew that Bashar Assad was going to use chemical weapons. And to say that maybe we've got the wrong approach?  he said. Both senators backed the nomination of Tillerson in January, even while expressing concern about his dealings with Russia when he was chief executive of ExxonMobil. (XOM.N) Graham, who visited Afghanistan and Pakistan last week with McCain, accused Tillerson of being  AWOL  on the two countries and failing to fill key State Department posts.  I am so worried about the State Department,” Graham said  on NBC's  Meet the Press.  A State Department official responded to the criticism of Tillerson by saying that a U.S.-Russian-brokered ceasefire for southwest Syria was an example of what the secretary had described as the potential to coordinate with Russia, in spite of unresolved differences,  to produce stability and serve our mutual security interests.  The official, who did not want to be identified, also said the State Department was taking an active role in a review of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy and continued to work with the White House on nominations. Since the exit of most foreign troops in 2014, Afghanistan’s U.S.-backed government has lost ground to a Taliban insurgency in a war that kills and maims thousands of civilians each year.

Trump said on Twitter early on Sunday that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed on Friday forming  an impenetrable Cyber Security unit  to address issues like the risk of cyber meddling in elections. The idea appeared to be a political non-starter. It was immediately scorned by several of Trump's fellow Republicans, who questioned why the United States would work with Russia after Moscow's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.  It's not the dumbest idea I have ever heard but it's pretty close,  Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told NBC's  Meet the Press  program.  Ash Carter, who was U.S. defense secretary until the end of former Democratic President Barack Obama's administration in January, told CNN flatly:  This is like the guy who robbed your house proposing a working group on burglary.  Trump's advisers, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, had recently sought to explain Trump's cyber push. Mnuchin said on Saturday that Trump and Putin had agreed to create  a cyber unit to make sure that there was absolutely no interference whatsoever, that they would work on cyber security together.  But Trump returned to Twitter on Sunday to play down the idea, which arose at his talks with Putin at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Hamburg, Germany.   The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't,   Trump said on Twitter.  Related CoverageKremlin: Putin and Trump made no promises on cyber groupRussia confirms Putin-Trump talk on joint cyber unitFactbox: Trump on Twitter (July 9) - G20, Putin, SyriaHe then noted that an agreement with Russia for a ceasefire in Syria  can & did  happen. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Trump's desire to move forward with Russia, but added:  There has to be a price to pay.   There has been no penalty,  McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBS'  Face the Nation  program according to a CBS transcript.  Vladimir Putin ... got away with literally trying to change the outcome ... of our election.  Trump argued for a rapprochement with Moscow in his campaign but has been unable to deliver because his administration has been dogged by investigations into the allegations of Russian interference in the election and ties with his campaign. U.S. President Donald Trump waves as walks on the South Lawn of the White House upon his return to Washington, U.S., from the G20 Summit in Hamburg, July 8, 2017.Yuri GripasSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the matter, including whether there may have been any collusion on the part of Trump campaign officials, as are congressional committees including both the House of Representatives and Senate intelligence panels. Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscow’s actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials say, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries despite Trump's suggestion that others could have been involved. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN's  State of the Union  program that Russia could not be a credible partner in a cyber security unit.  If that’s our best election defense, we might as well just mail our ballot boxes to Moscow,  Schiff added. Separately, U.S. government officials said a recent hack into business systems of U.S. nuclear power and other energy companies was carried out by Russian government hackers, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. 'Time to Move Forward' With Russia Trump said he  strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it.  He added:  We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!  In Trump's first attempt at ending the six-year Syrian civil war, the United States, Russia and Jordan on Friday reached a ceasefire and  de-escalation agreement  for southwestern Syria. The ceasefire was holding hours after it took effect on Sunday, a monitor and two rebel officials said.     Any joint U.S.-Russia cyber initiative would have been a different matter. Depending how much it veered into military or espionage operations, it could have faced major legal hurdles. Language in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits the Pentagon, which includes the National Security Agency and the U.S. military's Cyber Command, from using any funds for bilateral military cooperation with Russia. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, also noted restrictions on sharing information with Russia that would clearly prohibit offering Moscow a sense of U.S. cyber capabilities. Russia would be similarly adverse to revealing its capabilities to the United States, he noted.  It just will not happen,  McFaul told Reuters.

According to the person, J&F; shunned pressure from Cambuhy Investimentos Ltda and Itaúsa Investimentos SA to lower the asking price for an 86 percent stake in Alpargatas as the end of an exclusivity period for talks approached on Sunday. The person declined to elaborate on the size of the price gap. Reuters reported earlier in the day that Cambuhy and Itaúsa had offered 3.3 billion reais to 3.5 billion reais ($1 billion to $1.1 billion) for Alpargatas. Cambuhy, Itaúsa and Bradesco did not comment. J&F; did not have an immediate comment. J&F;, which oversees the fortune of the billionaire Batista family, must raise cash to pay a 10.3 billion real leniency fine and refinance looming loan maturities, the report said. Brothers and J&F;'s owners Joesley and Wesley Batista signed a leniency deal in May after admitting to bribing almost 1,900 politicians. The Batistas will resume the process to sell Alpargatas in the form of a competitive auction  as soon as possible,  said the person, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.  J&F; hired Banco Bradesco BBI as an advisor on the sale. Common shares of São Paulo-based Alpargatas have rallied 35 percent over the past three months, on speculation the Batistas would put the valuable fashion branding company and leisure clothing maker up for sale. The stock is up 63 percent this year. According to the person, J&F; sought a higher price for Alpargatas, which also manages a wide array of Brazilian fashion brands including beachwear brand Osklen. The company's Havaianas flip flops, created in 1962 during Brazil's Bossa-Nova musical movement, are worn globally by celebrities from Blake Lively to Jennifer Aniston. Itaúsa oversees the fortune of Brazil's Villela and Setubal families, who control São Paulo-based Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, Latin America's largest bank by assets. Cambuhy is the family office of Brazil's billionaire Moreira Salles family, also a major Itaú shareholder. Both Cambuhy and Itaúsa had informed regulators on June 26 that, should their bid succeeded, they would split equally the Alpargatas stake. Reuters had reported their preliminary bidding proposal on June 16. Pace of Talks The pace of talks between J&F; and the Cambuhy-Itaúsa group had gained steam in recent days, as creditors pressed the Batistas to renegotiate more than 30 billion reais of debt at J&F; and JBS SA, the world's No. 1 meatpacker, which the brothers also control. The Batistas planned to use proceeds from the Alpargatas stake sale to repay a 2.7 billion-real acquisition financing loan they took with state-controlled lender Caixa Econômica Federal, Reuters reported earlier in the day. The loan is under investigation by Brazil's audit court TCU for potential irregularities. The Batistas acquired Alpargatas in December 2015 from construction conglomerate Camargo Correa SA, which was ensnared in the same scandal. J&F;'s controlling stakes in dairy producer Fábrica de Produtos Alimentícios Vigor SA and pulpmaker Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA are also on the block and their sale processes are advancing, Reuters reported in recent weeks. The sale of Alpargatas, Vigor and Eldorado could raise 10 billion reais and cut J&F; debts by another 10 billion reais, people familiar with the family's strategy told Reuters on Sunday.

Brent prices are 17 percent below their 2017 opening despite a deal led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production from January. ANZ bank said on Monday that the market  continued to focus on the increasing (U.S.) drilling activity and higher production.  U.S. energy firms added seven oil drilling rigs last week, marking a 24th week of increases out of the last 25 and bringing the total count up to 763, the most since April 2015, Baker Hughes energy services company said on Friday.

The $1.5 billion 3.90 percent 144A/Reg S note, the largest 30-year from an Australian bank in any currency, priced at 103 basis points over Treasuries, well inside initial price thoughts of 120bp area. The spread is believed to be the tightest for any 30-year bank bond in dollars, and the coupon the lowest in the Yankee market at that maturity, according to bankers close to the deal. CBA, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley were joint bookrunners on the sale, which attracted a hefty order book of $3.4 billion and priced with a new issue concession of 3.5bp versus CBA’s 2.265 percent September 2026s after allowing 7.5bp for the 10 to 30-year curve extension.  Commonwealth Bank is delighted with the result of this landmark 30-year financing,  CBA group treasurer Paolo Tonucci said.  While we had confidence in the market appetite for long-dated paper, the outcome was better than anticipated.  Kylie Robb, head of group funding at CBA, emphasised two key drivers behind the transaction:  Firstly, favourable market conditions in general and very strong demand for long-dated paper from US and Asian insurance companies in particular, has led to secondary trading levels within even 10-year levels.  In addition, the regulatory environment ahead of the implementation of Australia’s net stable funding ratio on January 1 2018 supports such a long issue, which materially increases CBA’s average maturity while reducing the bank’s maturity concentrations.  The NSFR requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance-sheet activities. Swap Spreads CBA took advantage of a significant move in 30-year swap spreads from around -43bp a month ago to -29bp last Thursday – the biggest such move since at least 2011 – which makes it cheaper for banks to issue fixed-rate paper at the long end of the curve and swap it back into floating-rate notes. The trigger for the near 15bp shift was a Treasury report suggesting the removal of US Treasuries, cash and some interest rate derivatives from the denominator for the Supplementary Leverage Ratio. The post-US election rally in bank stocks has stalled of late as investors question the potential for true regulatory reform to clear the Senate, but analysts see the move in swaps spreads as a sign that some investors believe the Treasury's suggestions will become reality.  The Treasury report is where financial reform is really going to occur. A lot of these proposals can be implemented with just personnel changes, rather than new legislation,  said David Knutson, head of Americas credit research at Schroders.  This is the true low-hanging fruit for the Trump administration to deliver results,  wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts. The implication is that if 30-year swap spreads continue to become less negative, there should be more long-end issuance from banks, which has been extremely rare in recent years. “Thirty-year swap spreads are negative because banks have to hold capital against US Treasuries. If you take that capital requirement away, Treasuries should trade richer to swaps,” said a rates analyst in New York.

Compared to last year, the world has become more uncertain ... but the market seems quite happy,  GIC's CEO Lim Chow Kiat said in an interview, as the fund published its annual report.  I hope the market is right, but we are cautious.  Smaller Singapore peer Temasek Holdings focuses on equities, but GIC, set up to manage Singapore's foreign reserves, adopts a more conservative investment strategy, with the long-term goal of beating global inflation. GIC is ranked the world's tenth biggest sovereign investor, with about $343 billion worth of assets, according to Sovereign Wealth Centre. On Monday, the fund said its portfolio return was 5.1 percent per annum in U.S. dollar nominal terms over the five years to March 31, 2017, helped by the run-up in global financial assets, versus 3.7 percent a year ago. That was below the 6 percent return of GIC's reference portfolio of 65 percent global equities and 35 percent bonds. However, the volatility of GIC's portfolio was lower than the reference portfolio, for all time periods.  We are prepared for a period of protracted uncertainty and low returns,  said Lim, 47, who took charge as the CEO in January after a 24-year career at the fund. While market volatility was low by historic standards, helped by accommodative monetary policies, it was out of sync with increased overall uncertainty, the fund said. Current valuations, it added, suggest excessive optimism over future earnings. MSCI's gauge of world equities struck record highs last month.  Two years ago, we said the market would return x over the next 10 years. We would argue half of the x was returned in the first year, year and a half,  said Jeffrey Jaensubhakij, GIC's Chief Investment Officer.  Now there is only half an x over the next eight and a half years.  Taking the Long View In a low-growth, low-yield environment, sovereign wealth funds such as GIC are facing an ever greater challenge to make enough returns to hit internal targets. GIC reported a 20-year annualised real return - its key measurement gauge - of 3.7 percent above global inflation for the year ended March, down from 4 percent a year ago. GIC invests in growth and defensive assets such as emerging and developed market equities, real estate, private equity and inflation-linked bonds and is known to be a patient investor. GIC's cautious comments come days before Temasek is likely to report a rebound in its assets to a record high. With more than 1,400 staff, GIC says it manages  well over  $100 billion of assets, but does not disclose the exact size of its portfolio. It has 34 percent of its assets in the United States, followed by 19 percent in Asia excluding Japan, and 12 percent each in Japan and the Eurozone. Emerging market equities, which accounted for 17 percent of GIC's portfolio, offer opportunities after a few challenging years and subsequent reform, Jaensubhakij said - as opposed to developed markets such as the United States after an election-fuelled rally. GIC rarely comments on individual holdings, but it hit headlines in May when it pared its stake in UBS Group at a loss to 2.7 percent from 5.1 percent. GIC attributed the sale to changes in UBS' strategy and business. GIC, one of the first sovereign funds to invest in Western banks during the global financial crisis, retains the other major investment made at the time, a stake in Citigroup which is profitable at current prices.

The agency views positively the progressive implementation of the more stringent risk-based capital (RBC) regime in 2015/6. For instance, a 99% confidence level is used to calibrate various risk factors, from the previous 95%. This increases the overall financial health and resilience of the industry. IFRS 17, scheduled for implementation in 2021, requires insurance liabilities to be valued at current interest rates rather than inception rates. This would increase the value of the insurers' liabilities and reduce their regulatory RBC ratio. The extent of reduction varies from insurer to insurer, but will be more pronounced for life insurers, given the long-term nature of their liabilities, says Fitch.

Match them with friends","keywords":"Sudan,United Kingdom,Abu Haron,Anneke Elwes,US,BRITAIN,MIGRANTS,LONELINESS,Features,Aid Relief / Humanitarian Agencies,Society / Social Issues,Western Europe,Asylum / Immigration / Refugees,England,Africa,Sudan,Government Borrowing Requirement,Europe,Non,Governmental Organizations,United Kingdom","sector":"Subjects","content":"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Sudanese refugee Abu Haron first arrived in England in 2010, after clinging to the underside of a schoolbus from Calais in northern France, the teenager found himself at a police station surrounded by people speaking a strange language. He was 16, alone and unable to speak English. Haron said he was terrified British authorities would deport him to his home in Sudan's Darfur region where war had broken out.   I felt scared and lonely and lost because I was just sitting there waiting for an interview,  said Haron, now 23.  I didn't know anything about English. People (were) passing around me and speaking. I didn't know what was going on, what they were saying,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Though Haron spent the next year studying English and socializing by playing football, he said he had nobody to rely on when he got to London, an overwhelming city compared to the small village in Darfur he fled from when it was razed and burnt to the ground by militias. But then a letter arrived from British woman Anneke Elwes, inviting him on a walk through London's Hampstead Heath park. The pair were introduced through a befriending service run by British charity Freedom from Torture.  As the mother of two sons who are of a similar age to Haron, 55-year-old Elwes said the young man quickly became part of the family, even celebrating Christmas for the first time with a traditional lunch and an egg-and-spoon race a few years ago.  All the family they welcomed me like their son, and I'm glad I have a mum in England. So many of the migrants they don't have this chance,  said Haron, sitting next to his  UK mum  at her home in north London.  When you have someone in your life, who even just speaks to you on the phone, it gives you confidence. You're not alone. It's a big difference,  he said.  Befrienders Meeting Haron inspired Elwes to found HostNation, a website that matches adult refugees with volunteer befrienders in their neighborhood.  For a lot of refugees and asylum seekers the only English people they actually get to meet are officials,  she said. A sense of loneliness and isolation is common among asylum seekers and refugees due to language barriers, poverty, and a lack of social support, charities say.  We know that refugees and asylum seekers experience isolation - it's a massive problem,  said Mariam Kemple Hardy, campaigns manager at Refugee Action.  Being unable to speak to your neighbor, let alone make friends beyond that, can be extremely isolating for these people who come to the UK to rebuild their lives.  Travel can also be difficult for refugees and asylum seekers, since many cannot afford public transport and often walk for hours to access services or to meet friends and families. The British Red Cross said it helped over 14,000 homeless and destitute asylum seekers in 2016 who relied on an asylum allowance of about 36 pounds ($46) a week. There are plenty of families in London who would like to help and ensure new arrivals  see a more positive side to English life,  said Elwes. After launching HostNation in March, she is now starting to match refugees with befrienders across London, a lengthy process that requires referrals from refugee agencies, rigorous screening and reference checks.  We want other people to benefit and have a rewarding relationship like we've had,  said Elwes, as she and Haron smile over the first letters they exchanged six years ago.  Things like being invited into someone's home or meeting their family can be really special, it can be quite transformative.

U.S. job growth surged more than expected in June and employers increased hours for workers, suggesting the Fed could stick to its plan for its third interest rate hike this year and begin to reduce its balance sheet despite sluggish wage gains and tepid inflation. Against the yen, the dollar was 0.1 percent higher at 113.98 , after notching a high of 114.18 in the wake of the jobs report, its loftiest level since May 11. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback against a currency basket, was steady at 96.018.  The solid jobs report gives us more reason to expect the Fed to announce that it's prepared to start trimming its balance sheet,  said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities.  By contrast, the Bank of Japan is nowhere near a policy exit, and it's taking steps that weaken the yen,  he said. On Friday, the BOJ sought to keep Japanese government bond yields near its policy target, embarking on a special market operation as well as increasing the size of its regular JGB purchase operations. Recent positioning data showed that some investors pared their long dollar positions ahead of the jobs report, amid concerns that a spate of lacklustre data would prompt the Fed to alter its hawkish plans. Speculators this week slashed net long bets on the U.S. dollar to their lowest since mid-May 2016 in the week ended July 4, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The value of the dollar's net long position dropped to $135 million, from net longs of $4.5 billion the previous week. The latest week marked the first time since mid-April 2016 that net long dollar positioning fell to under $1 billion. Higher U.S. Treasury yields underpinned the dollar. The benchmark 10-year U.S. yield stood at 2.389 percent in Asian trading, not far from its U.S. close of 2.393 percent on Friday, when it touched a more than eight-week high of 2.398 percent after the jobs report. The euro edged down 0.1 percent to $1.1400 but gained against its Japanese counterpart. The euro was 0.1 percent higher at 129.99 yen, after rising as high as 130.125 yen on Friday, its highest since February 2016.

The Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander turned in a tight, brisk and complete-game effort Sunday in a 5-2 win, striking out 13 and limiting the Kansas City Royals to six hits. Kershaw (14-2) did not issue a walk and he didn't have a three-ball count until the last batter of the game. He needed just 99 pitches, 73 of them strikes, to subdue the Royals. It was Kershaw's major league-leading 14th win, and he becomes the first Dodger to go into the break with 14 wins or more since Sandy Koufax won 15 in 1966. Los Angeles is 17-2 in Kershaw's 19 starts, and this was his 16th quality start of the season. In his last 13 starts, he's 10-0 with a 1.98 ERA and .187 opponents' batting average. Kershaw's effort was a major league first, too -- no pitcher has ever had 13 or more strikeouts in a complete game while throwing under 100 pitches. Eric Hosmer was the only wart, the Royals' first baseman getting three of the six hits, including a two-run home run -- his 12th of the season. He extended his hitting streak to 15 games. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at DodgersKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatch It's a good way to end the first half,'' said Kershaw, who will attend his seventh All-Star Game Tuesday.  They were very aggressive so I was able to keep the pitch count low. The bullpen has had to throw a lot of innings this week so it was good to give them a rest.''  He was Clayton-esque,'' manager Dave Roberts said of Kershaw's performance.  The low pitch count was a combination of their being aggressive and Clayton's efficiency in throwing strikes. We really wanted him to finish it.'' Justin Turner hit a pair of home runs, giving him 10 on the season, and catcher Austin Barnes hit one in the fifth. It was Kershaw's first complete game in a season in which the Dodgers count pitches like a banker counts bills. As an example of their cautious attitude, Kershaw won't pitch again for more than week. Los Angeles won't use him in the first series after the break against Miami. The Dodgers go into the All-Star Game break with the best record in the majors at 61-29, a pace that projects to 109 wins. The win Sunday was their 26th in their last 30 games, and they are 18-1 in their last 19 home games and 39-11 on the season at Dodger Stadium, a .780 percentage that is better than the club record for a full season (1953, 60-17, .779). It was Los Angeles' 10th series sweep of the season, and 54th time in 90 games the pitching staff has allowed three runs or less in a game. The Royals lost just their second series in their last 11 and have dropped three straight since launching an 18-6 run of success on June 2.  We're an aggressive team,'' Royals manager Ned Yost said.  We got behind in counts early and didn't have many good swings. He's a great pitcher and they're a great team. We came in here on a roll and they shut us down (seven runs in three games).'' Turner hit a solo home run in the first and finished a three-run third with his second of the game and 10th of 2017 with a two-run shot. A Trayce Thompson triple and Logan Forsythe single scored the other run in the third. With one on, Hosmer slugged his 12th home run to left-center to cut the Dodgers' lead to 4-2. Barnes homered in the sixth, his fifth, to make it 5-2.  When it's hot and there's a little breeze, the ball flies pretty good,'' Turner said of his two home runs.  I haven't made any adjustments for home runs. Sometimes they go over the fence, sometimes they don't. I've probably had 30 flies to the warning track this season.'' Kershaw answered a question about the Dodgers' hot streak and was philosophical in his response.  How long is a hot streak? Or is it just us?'' he said.  We'll find out.'' NOTES: Aside from the three home runs, Royals starter Danny Duffy (5-5) pitched well. He allowed six hits and struck out nine. ... Home plate umpire Kerwin Danley was hit on his mask near the forehead with a foul tip in the first inning and crumpled into the arms of Royals catcher Drew Butera. He finished the half-inning and then went for medical tests. Adam Hamari replaced him behind the plate ... The Dodgers rested SS Corey Seager, C Yasmani Grandal and OF Joc Pederson. ... The Royals sat out C Salvador Perez, OF Jeff Gordon and 3B Mike Moustakas. ... Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said LHP Clayton Kershaw would not pitch in the first series after the break. ``With Clayton, we've pushed him pretty hard in the first half,  Roberts said.  We have sort of built in some rest for some guys and there have been injuries that have created short rest for starters. Clayton is the one guy we have to be mindful of as well. To potentially give him a few extra days and using the break, makes sense.''","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-royals-dodgers-writethru-idUSMTZED7AUJWJS1"},

The longtime Seattle ace, who was sidelined for nearly two months this season with shoulder problems, pitched six scoreless innings and Nelson Cruz hit a home run as the Mariners defeated the Oakland Athletics 4-0 on Sunday afternoon at Safeco Field.  He had a different look about him today,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said of Hernandez.  Hands down, his best stuff (of the season).  Hernandez (4-3) allowed two hits, walked three and struck out a season-high eight. The right-hander, who was making his fourth start since coming off the disabled list -- he was out from April 26 to June 22 with inflammation in his right shoulder -- lowered his ERA from 5.04 to 4.44. The only hits Hernandez allowed were a one-out double to Matt Joyce in the third inning and a two-out single to Jaycob Brugman in the fifth.  From fastball to changeup, all the pitches were working,  Hernandez said.  I'm healthy and feeling good.  As for the season high in strikeouts? Related CoveragePreview: Athletics at MarinersOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch When you have good stuff ...  Hernandez said. Hernandez now has 2,310 career strikeouts, passing Juan Marichal for 49th on the all-time list.  It's an honor,  Hernandez said. Hernandez got his first strikeout when he fanned Matt Chapman with two on to end the second inning. Hernandez struck out two batters in each of the next three innings, and capped his day by getting Jed Lowrie to swing at a third strike to end the sixth.  He stepped it up. You could see that from the beginning,  Servais said.  He needed to get deep and give us a chance to win.  He doesn't have to throw nine shutout innings. He got a lot of ground-ball outs early and then put up strikeouts. He still has effective stuff.  It was Hernandez's 24th career victory against the A's, breaking a tie with Frank Tanana for the most by an opposing pitcher since the team moved to Oakland in 1968.  We've seen him good plenty of times. It didn't look a whole lot different,  A's manager Bob Melvin said of Hernandez.  Looked like his velocity might have been a little bit better than we were seeing in video recently, think he hit 92, maybe 93. But, as he does, he mixed it up, pitched backwards and throw more curveballs than we're used to seeing. He was really good.  Seattle's Tony Zych, Marc Rzepczynski, Nick Vincent and Edwin Diaz combined for three hitless innings of relief to cap the victory. Cruz's two-run homer to right-center field in the fourth inning gave the Mariners a 3-0 lead against A's right-hander Daniel Gossett (1-4). It came after fellow All-Star Robinson Cano led off with a double. Cruz, who will be the designated hitter for the American League in the All-Star Game, has been battling nagging hamstring and knee injuries for weeks.  He's unbelievable,  Hernandez said.  He just wants to be in the lineup every day.  The Mariners opened the scoring in the third, as Jarrod Dyson led off with a walk, moved to third on a single to shallow left field by Carlos Ruiz and scored when Jean Segura grounded into a double play. After Cruz's homer, the Mariners tacked on a run in the seventh. Danny Valencia walked, went to second on a single by Dyson and scored on Ruiz's single to left. Gossett, a rookie, allowed three runs on five hits in 4 1/3 innings. He walked two -- the first time he has walked more than one in six career starts -- and struck out four.  I thought he threw the ball pretty well,  Melvin said.  At that point (in the fifth inning), with four days off and a loaded bullpen, I just couldn't give up another run. ... Third time through the middle of the order, I just felt like it was time for him to come out.  The Mariners (43-47) won for just the second time in their past 11 home games to split the four-game series with Oakland (39-50). NOTES: Seattle DH Nelson Cruz heads into the All-Star break with 70 RBIs, the franchise's first player to reach that mark at the break since Raul Ibanez in 2006. ... Mariners C Carlos Ruiz, who entered the game with a .194 average, went 3-for-3 to improve his average to .227. ... Oakland LF Khris Davis struck out once and has fanned 117 times this season, a franchise record for most before the All-Star break. ... The Mariners are 40-15 when scoring four or more runs this season. ... Mariners RHP Nick Vincent pitched a scoreless inning of relief. Vincent hasn't allowed a run in 21 appearances at home this season, spanning 20 innings. ... The A's will play host to the Cleveland Indians when play resumes Friday after the All-Star break. The Mariners open in Chicago against the White Sox, before completing a six-game trip in Houston.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-athletics-mariners-writethru-idUSMTZED7AUIZ6QK"},

In February this year he installed a 300-watt solar power generating system on the roof of his house. In Pakistan, power outages scheduled by the country’s strained public electric utilities frequently hit households, lasting as long as 10 hours a day in towns and cities and up to 16 hours in rural areas. The situation is worst during the brutally hot summer months, when air-conditioners often overload the national grid. Buying solar panels to create power at home might seem an obvious way to bridge the gap. But although the panels have been available since 2014 in Aslam’s town of Larkana, in the southern province of Sindh, the 35-year-old entrepreneur waited two years before finally installing one. Cost wasn’t the problem. Instead, he said, he was put off by rumors that solar panels would actually make things worse. Unscrupulous local utility officials, he says, told him that the dark-colored solar panels, built to absorb the sun’s rays and convert them to electricity, would increase the ambient heat in the buildings they were attached to, pushing the temperature indoors even higher. According to Aslam, the officials even said that the growing use of solar panels was to blame for the more frequent and intense heat waves that Pakistan has experienced – something scientists say is entirely untrue. Climate change and worsening extreme heat is instead driven largely by a huge expansion in the use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas since the start of the industrial revolution, they say. “I discovered it was a fake rumor only after I installed the solar system on the insistence of my friend, a graduate in electric engineering,” Aslam told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. His friend assured him that the rumors were just a trick by utility company employees bent on discouraging wide-scale adoption of solar energy adoption in order to safeguard their jobs. Tariq Mehmood, general manager of the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), a public power utility, said he was not aware of any IESCO employees spreading rumors. “Our power utility has nothing to do with (any rumors) and disowns them. People shouldn’t believe them,” Mehmood said in a telephone interview. ‘a Great Relief’ Aslam’s new solar home system – two solar panels, four ceiling fans, four energy-saving lights and a rechargeable battery – cost him $500. During the day the system powers the ceiling fans and stores enough electricity in the battery to run the fans and lights for six or seven hours at night if the grid electricity supply goes off. The battery can recharge in sunlight in three hours. “We have fans and lights (that) remain on whenever power outages hit us. What makes me more happy is that my family feels a great relief thanks to it,” Aslam said. Abdul Karim, a solar panel retailer at the Aabpara electronic market in Islamabad, Pakistan’s capital, said prospective customers often mention having heard the rumors that solar panels add to heat problems. “To prove these rumors wrong, often I have to take them to the rooftop of my shop to show them the solar system that powers my shop,” Karim said. “Then many buy solar systems from me.” As solar home systems become more affordable, many households see them as an alternative to trying to get a new electrical connection via the public power utilities. According to Mir Ahmad Shah, executive secretary of the Pakistan Renewable and Alternative Energy Association, public utilities that control power distribution and supply fear that the gradual adoption of solar energy will make people less reliant on the national grid. “Employees of the public power utilities are hampering this growing shift to solar energy through rumors, because they fear the growing adoption solar energy systems will lead to overall revenue decline from new connection applications,” Shah said. Cash for Service? Retired Pakistan Railways employee Raja Jameel said he was unsuccessful in getting a grid connection two year ago for his new home in Ghouri, a rural locality on Islamabad’s outskirts. “What (finally) worked in a matter of a few hours to get what I was denied for nearly four months was a $50 bribe to a superintendent of IESCO,” Jameel said in an interview. He said he believes that in some utility companies, employees responsible for approving new power connections try to dissuade potential solar adopters by spreading false rumors about the panels, largely because they do not want to lose potential bribes for approving new grid connections. Jameel plans to build a second storey onto his home to rent out, but he says he will install a 2-kilowatt solar home system to power it, rather than begging for a new power connection from the utility. IESCO’s Mehmood said that although the utility had periodically received complaints from customers about bribe-taking, it had taken steps to reduce the problem. “IESCO management has controlled (bribe-taking) through a strong online public complaint redressal system established a few years ago. Besides, we have made the process of sanctioning and issuing new electricity connection systems more transparent and hassle-free,” Mehmood said. In an interview outside the Parliament building in Islamabad, Minister of State for Water and Power Abid Sher Ali did not deny that power distribution companies, including IESCO, have had problems with corruption, but said the government took all complaints regarding such matters seriously. “We have a zero tolerance policy regarding bribery in the public power utilities across the country,” Ali said.

Jolts to financial markets from North Korea's military provocations are frequent but were until recently contained by an implicit expectation that global diplomatic efforts could limit Pyongyang's aggression. Now, however, there is as much market anxiety about Trump's unrestrained Tweets and a hawkish White House response as there is about North Korean agitations. Since Trump's election in November, price reactions to North Korean long-range missile tests in credit and currency derivatives, typically used by traders to hedge geopolitical risk, have been distinctly sharper.  Trump has moved markets and China more within months than (Barack) Obama in eight years,  said Cliff Tan, East Asian head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.     The reclusive North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches in defiance of U.N. resolutions for decades as it is still at war with South Korea after the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Before Trump's election, missile tests came with such regularity that markets learned to shrug them off. This year, the options market shows the cost of insuring investments against North Korean-related risks has surged, with 3-month protection against a drop in the won, for example, reaching a high of 231 basis points in mid-April, double the levels six months earlier. This spike came as the U.S. diverted a warship towards the Korean Peninsula and showed off its strike capability in Syria, which it conducted just as Trump met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The cost of owning the option to sell the won in April was the highest it had been since August 2015, when the two Koreas were in a tense military standoff.  It's the Trump-on-stage reaction,  a currency trader in Seoul said.  Trump's hard line approach, and his past crazy comments on everything from the Mexico-wall to Syria policies have created a whole new range of uncertainties for traders investing here.  A woman talking on the phone walks past an electronic board of the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) at the Korea Exchange (KRX) in Seoul, South Korea, January 20, 2016Kim Hong-JiPricing in Trump Despite heightened geopolitical tensions, South Korea's main asset markets have performed well this year with the won KRW=KFTC and Kospi stock benchmark .KS11 up 4.6 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, on robust exports and an upbeat outlook on second quarter corporate earnings. The cost of hedging, however, is where investors have felt the pain: options to sell Korean won for dollars were perversely more expensive after Trump's November presidential victory than when North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test two months earlier. The premium on three-month options to sell the won had hovered around 100 basis points for years before Trump took office, and barely budged even when then U.S. President Obama issued a stern warning to Pyongyang following a missile test in April 2016.  Financial markets have become more sensitive to the U.S. stance with more hard line policies under Trump, compared to when the Democrats were in power,  Shim Hyun-soo, a senior fund manager with the quantitative management team of Kyobo AXA Investment Managers, said. In other derivatives markets, the spread on South Korea's 5-year credit default swap KRGV5YUSAC=MG--the contracts that offer investors protection against default on debt--reached a 10-month high of 60 basis points on April 17. Market pricing of expected volatility in the won KRWVOL has also been on the rise, with the one-month implied volatility hitting 13.2 percent in April, the highest in five years.      During the Obama administration, the markets didn't care much about the North. Everyone knew the Kim Jong Un regime wouldn’t do anything stupid for real as it could really be the beginning of the end,  said Jeon Seung-ji, a Seoul-based currency analyst at Samsung Futures.  North Korean risks are no longer a 'half-day-slip', mainly because markets are not sure how Washington would handle them,  Jeon said.

Starting Sunday, the partnerships will allow online merchants using Stripe to integrate the ability for Chinese users to pay with Alipay and WeChat Pay on their websites, the company said. Stripe hopes the integration will help boost its revenues by allowing clients to tap China's vast consumer market, where credit cards account for only a fraction of online spending, the company said. Alipay is the flagship payment service of Ant Financial, the financial affiliate of major Chinese ecommerce company Alibaba Group Holdings and has over 520 million users. WeChat Pay has more than 600 million users and is the payment app of entertainment and social network firm Tencent Holdings .  If you are an internet business this unlocks a new vast customer base,  John Collison, Stripe's president and co-founder, said in an interview. In turn, Chinese consumers will have expanded choice as to which international online merchants they can purchase products and services from, he added. Founded by brothers John and Patrick Collison in 2010, Stripe provides technology that enables merchants in 25 countries to accept payments online. It charges a fee on each payments transactions processed through its platform.  If we can help a business double their sales, then it doubles our revenue from that business,  Collison said. The partnership coincides with the company's launch in Hong Kong. One of the most valuable venture-backed financial technology companies globally, Stripe has risen in popularity among software developers and online merchants because of its ease of use. It is among the cohort of young fintech companies seeking to reinvent the payments landscape by taking better advantage of digital technologies to offer more user-friendly financial services and products. It had previously partnered with Alipay to enable only the U.S. merchants on its platform to integrate the Chinese payment service. The new global partnership builds on that experience.  Demand for services from Chinese consumers is at all-time high,  Souheil Badran, president of Alipay for North America, said in an interview. The new partnerships will connect them to hundreds of thousands of Stripe-powered businesses around the world, he added.

This will allow the banks to meet TLAC requirements, build a safety margin and refinance expiring legacy instruments. The banks are already well-positioned to meet risk-weighted asset (RWA) and leverage requirements, and we expect the market to absorb this estimated issuance - given that the holding companies of the mega bank groups issued USD33 billion in TLAC eligible senior unsecured bonds over the 12 months to end-March 2017. Only MUFG was below the 2019 and 2022 RWA thresholds at FYE17, while MHFG is short of the currently known thresholds for leverage. The total shortfall of MUFG and MHFG is therefore USD13.2 billion based on 2019 thresholds and USD30.4 billion on 2022 thresholds. SMFG has already met the requirements. There are several potential factors that could add to the TLAC challenge faced by the mega banks, most significantly the Basel Committee's proposal to introduce a capital floor. The details are still to be agreed by the Committee, but banks' estimate that their RWAs could increase by around 25%. In terms of other challenges, profitability and internal capital generation could be undermined by a deterioration in the operating environment, either at home or overseas. In addition, a lack of investor demand for loss-absorbing securities - while not part of our central scenario - could make compliance more difficult. Stronger balance-sheet growth than we currently expect or significant M&A; activity could add to capital requirements. Volatility of the yen could also affect capitalisation and RWA. Japan's mega banks are the only global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) in Asia-Pacific to which the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements will start to apply from 2019. China's four G-SIBs have until end-2024.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

That's exactly what right-hander JC Ramirez and three relievers did Sunday as the Angels salvaged the final game of a three-game set against the Texas Rangers with a 3-0 victory. Despite the win, the Angels (45-47) are below .500 at the All-Star break for the third time in the last five seasons. Texas (43-45) missed a chance to get to .500 for the first time since June 28 after suffering its second shutout of the season. The Angels had scored a total of four runs in their last three games and the offense was the main culprit for a team that had lost five of six coming into Sunday. But Ramirez (8-7), who struggled in his last two starts, didn't allow a hit until Nomar Mazara doubled with one out in the fourth inning. He surrendered just two hits, struck out two and worked around five walks in six innings. Ramirez was helped out by going with his four-seam fastball.  Today, I used my four-seam more than my two-seam,  Ramirez said.  I talked with (pitching coach Charles) Nagy about it. We talked about it the last bullpen that I threw and he said, 'Yeah, why not?' Related CoveragePreview: Angels at RangersLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatch I had been throwing all two-seamers. I started throwing them today, but I was kind of rushing my delivery. I thought I did well.  Los Angeles got three hitless innings from relievers David Hernandez, Cam Bedrosian and Bud Norris to complete the seventh shutout of the season. Norris picked up his 13th save with a hitless ninth to complete the two-hitter.  The six zeroes were huge, but it's not often you're going to walk five guys and come out unscathed,  Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia said.  But he (Ramirez) got some big outs. He got big outs in the third and then again in the fifth.  It's not easy to pitch a shutout in this park. We've got four guys that went out there and put up zeroes. That's tough to do.  The Angels did just enough against Texas right-hander Yu Darvish (6-8) to give Ramirez the support he needed. Albert Pujols lined a solo homer to left-center with two outs in the first inning to give the Angels their first lead of the series. The Angels doubled the advantage in the fifth on a sacrifice fly from catcher Juan Graterol. Darvish gave up two runs and three hits in 7 1/3 innings. He struck out six and walked four and hasn't won a game since June 12. The Rangers have scored a total of one run while Darvish has been pitching in his last four starts combined.  Overall, I managed to go through 7 1/3 despite the fact I walked four guys,  Darvish said.  The guys were putting the ball in play early in the count and I think that was a good thing.  Run support-wise, we've not been scoring many runs when I've been pitching, but it is what it is. It's part of baseball. I don't really think about that.  Ramirez was able to come up big in key situations. After the Mazara double in the fourth, he retired Adrian Beltre and Rougned Odor. Texas threatened again in the fifth, putting runners on second and third, but Ramirez got a groundout from Shin-Soo Choo to end the inning. Texas manager Jeff Banister heaped praise on Ramirez.  We ran into a guy today who was on top of his game, threw the ball well,  Banister said.  I felt like Darvish threw the ball extremely well. He made two mistakes.  In those situations, we had two opportunities with runners in scoring position and came away with nothing. I'll take Darvish continuing to throw the ball well and take our chances.  The Rangers were 0-for-4 with runners in scoring position and 0-for-12 in those situations in the final two games of the series. Los Angeles added a run in the ninth on an RBI double from Andrelton Simmons and finished the game with five hits. Texas didn't have a hit after a two-out single from Delino DeShields in the sixth. NOTES: The Rangers will go with LHP Martin Perez, LHP Cole Hamels and RHP Yu Darvish for their series at Kansas City starting Friday. ... With his six strikeouts, Darvish moved into fifth place on the Rangers' career list with 937 and is two behind Nolan Ryan. ... The Angels finished the series 1-for-11 with runners in scoring position.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-rangers-writethru-idUSMTZED79UHL72W"},

Baseball fans have long held a fascination with the soaring home run and the mighty men who hit them. It is a love affair launched by Yankees the great Babe Ruth, whose towering drives changed the game forever and brought him the nickname of the Sultan of Swat. They love Judge too, making him the top vote-getter in fan balloting with nearly 4.5 million for the American League All-Star team that will play on Tuesday. He entered Sunday's last games of the first half of the season leading the majors in home runs (30), runs scored (75) and on-base percentage (.449), while batting .330. With his 30th home run launched against the Milwaukee Brewers on Friday, Judge surpassed  Joltin Joe  DiMaggio for the Bronx Bombers' rookie record for homers in a season. The great DiMaggio took 138 games in his 1936 rookie season to set that mark. Judge zipped by him in his 82nd game. The 6-foot-7 (2.01 m), 282-pound (128 kg) Judge, a surprisingly athletic, agile, speedy all-round force on the diamond, is on an ultra-fast track to stardom mirroring the exit velocity of one of his booming blasts, two of which have literally dented Yankee Stadium walls. Craig Counsell, manager of the National League Central-leading Brewers, saw the 25-year-old Judge at work for the first time in person during their weekend series in the Bronx.  He's unlike anything we’ve really seen in the game,  Counsell told Reuters from the visitors' dugout at Yankee Stadium on Sunday.  It’s fun to see that.  The thing I’ve been impressed with, he’s got a very good baseball swing for a man that big, for a kid that big. That’s what’s impressive to me.  As impressive as his towering drives and laser-beam liners have been, his calm, humble demeanor has also won him praise. Fast becoming a leader on the team, Judge has been likened by club manager Joe Girardi to the most recent Mr. Yankee - retired captain Derek Jeter. Girardi said Judge's overtaking DiMaggio was jaw-dropping.  That's a pretty special name he passed. It's really incredible what he's done in the first half,  said Girardi. Adopted as a newborn by teachers Patty and Wayne Judge in  rural California some 90 miles from the San Francisco Bay Area, Judge grew to become a dominant athlete, shining as a football wide receiver and an All-State center on the high school basketball team. The Yankees scooped up MLB's 2017 sensation in the first round of the 2013 draft with the 32nd overall pick out of Fresno State University. Now the celebrated slugger has his own team-sponsored cheering section in the right-field stands behind his defensive spot -- an 18-seat, three-row area dubbed  The Judge's Chambers,  where 18 fans are selected to sit each game and given judges' robes, wigs and foam gavels to play their part. Frank Thomas, another impressively built slugger of his day who was inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame in 2014, warned that Judge would likely be given little to hit in the second half by pitchers afraid to challenge him. Judge shrugged off how that might affect his personal statistics.  If they want to pitch around me, that's fine,  he said.  We've got a great lineup. If I'm getting on base four times because of a walk, that's perfect.

Freeland held the White Sox hitless for 8 1/3 innings before Melky Cabrera lined a single to left that finished Freeland's workday after 126 pitches, 80 strikes. Freeland was replace by Jordan Lyles after giving up the base hit. Freeland was bidding to become the first Rockies pitcher to throw a no-hitter at Coors Field. Freeland, a 24-year-old rookie left-hander, hit one batter and walked three in his 18th career start. He had a career-high nine strikeouts, all swinging. Colorado left fielder Gerardo Parra charged a fly ball hit by Yolmer Sanchez and made a sprawling catch to open the eighth. Freeland, who was born 39 days after the first game in Rockies franchise history in 1993, pointed to Parra, thanking him for the effort. Freeland's no-hit bid was the second longest by a Rockies pitcher and second longest at Coors Field. Ubaldo Jimenez threw the only no-hitter in Rockies history -- April 17, 2010, at Atlanta. He walked six and struck out seven and threw 128 pitches, 72 strikes, in Colorado's 4-0 win while facing 31 batters. The only no-hitter at Coors Field was thrown by Hideo Nomo of the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sept. 17, 1996. In Los Angeles' 9-0 victory, Nomo walked four and struck out eight and faced 30 batters, while throwing 66 of 110 pitches for strikes.

Downing-USA TODAY SportsWhite Sox starting pitcher Carlos Rodon (1-2) took the loss, giving up five runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings. The Rockies scored two runs in the second inning and put the focus squarely on Freeland rather than the outcome with a five-run sixth, a rally that began with Charlie Blackmon's long home run and included Pat Valaika's three-run shot. In Colorado's three-run seventh, Valaika had a two-run single, giving him a career-high five RBIs. Freeland singled home a run in that inning. Freeland had gone 0-3 with a 7.27 ERA in his past three starts. And in his most recent outing Tuesday against Cincinnati, Freeland received a lengthy fourth-inning lecture on the mound from Rockies manager Bud Black. He shooed away the infielders and held a stern one-on-one meeting with Freeland, who then retired the next eight batters he faced. Slideshow (9 Images)Freeland (9-7) retired the first 11 Chicago batters he faced before nicking Jose Abreu with a pitch in the fourth. He walked Omar Narvaez to open the sixth. Pitcher Carlos Rodon sacrificed Narvaez to second, and he took third on Adam Engel's grounder to shortstop. But Freeland stranded Engel by getting Cabrera to fly to short center. Freeland walked Abreu and Todd Frazier to start the seventh, pushing his pitch count to 89. Chris Rusin began loosening up in the Colorado bullpen. But Freeland got Avisail Garcia to ground into a double play and retired Tim Anderson on a fly to right. In the Rockies two-run second inning, Mark Reynolds led off with a walk and reached third on Parra's double. Valaika's grounder to second netted a run and moved Parra to third. He scored on catcher Narvaez's errant pick-off throw. Blackmon slammed his 20th homer to open the sixth, when the Rockies sent 11 batters to the plate and scored five runs. He drove Rodon's 1-0 fastball that was clocked at 92 miles an estimated 477 feet. The ball hit the back wall of the White Sox's bullpen in right-center. Rodon walked two of the next three batters he faced in that inning, and Parra singled to right. Pinch runner Alexi Amarista scored, sliding home just ahead of right fielder Avisail Garcia's throw to make it 4-0. The Rockies then blew the game open when Chris Beck came on, and Valaika greeted him with a three-run homer. He drove Beck's 1-1 slider into the left-field stands for his seventh homer.

After losing the first two games in Minnesota, Baltimore had lost five games in a row. Dating to June 9, the Orioles were 11-20 and had two losing streaks of at least five games while falling from 2 1/2 games back in the American League East to 8 1/2 games. The break is welcomed by the Orioles. Adam Jones and the rest of the Baltimore hitters made sure they'd take the vacation with some positive feelings that pulled them within 7 1/2 games of the Boston Red Sox. Jones homered twice and drove in five runs and Caleb Joseph added two hits and three RBIs as the Orioles went into the All-Star break with two straight wins after Sunday's 11-5 victory over the Twins.  We've got some days off, so hopefully we can mentally get away from this game, mentally put behind us the last two months of baseball and come out in the second half with blazing saddles and ready to attack this East,  Jones said.  It's not going to get any easier, and I think our guys understand that. Let's do what we have to do.  Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at TwinsBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchJones had his first multi-homer game of the season and 11th of his career, taking Minnesota's Kyle Gibson deep twice. Seth Smith and Ruben Tejada each had three hits for Baltimore.  They jumped out early and kept going after,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  You could tell they wanted to end on a good note. ... The runs that were there for us to score we took advantage of. A lot of times you leave those out there; a lot of good, professional at-bats.  Ubaldo Jimenez survived one bad inning thanks to Baltimore's highest offensive output since scoring a season-high 15 runs on June 17. Jimenez (4-4) allowed four runs, four hits and four walks in five innings. Gibson (5-7) surrendered seven runs, nine hits and two walks in four innings.  It's frustrating to leave the bullpen feeling good like I did and feel like (catcher Chris Gimenez) and I had a pretty good plan today,  Gibson said.  It's frustrating for that to turn out that way. I don't think, other than the two walks, I threw enough strikes. I think it was just the quality of strikes.  The offensive burst started quickly against Gibson as Smith walked on four pitches to start the game. Jonathan Schoop singled and Jones hit a blast to center field estimated at 444 feet. Baltimore added two runs in the second and four in the fifth to end Gibson's day. Jones' second homer, his 15th of the year, led off the fifth. Joseph added a two-run blooper to right and Tejada plated another run on a double. Gibson had turned around his season in recent outings with a 3.98 ERA in his last seven starts, in which he was 4-2. Gibson also entered the game with 6.6 runs of support per start, the second-highest mark in the American League for pitchers with at least 15 starts.  We've been back and forth on Kyle; good days, bad days, and when things go haywire,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  Today, I thought the leadoff walks really hurt him.  The Twins took advantage of a shaky Jimenez in the second, batting around in the inning and scoring four runs on just two hits. Kennys Vargas was hit by a pitch before Jimenez got two outs. He then walked in a run with three straight walks. Robbie Grossman laced a two-run single and Max Kepler followed with an RBI double. Jimenez thought he wasn't getting strikes called from home-plate umpire Lance Barrett.  We re-watched the video and all those pitches were in the strike zone,  Jimenez said.  I don't know what happened. I have respect about the umpires who are out there because, just like us, they're trying to do the best they can out there. But in that inning, I think it was too many times.  NOTES: Minnesota C Jason Castro was scratched from the lineup prior to the game. Multiple reports said Castro is dealing with neck spasms. Chris Gimenez took his spot in the lineup. ... With a three-run homer in the first inning, Orioles CF Adam Jones tallied the 768th RBI of his career, passing Ken Singleton for fifth in team history. ...

The 35-year-old Australian held off Ashleigh Buhai of South Africa with a 2-under-par 70 in the final round and won the Thornberry Creek LPGA Classic by one shot in Oneida, Wis. Kirk finished the first-year event at 22-under 266, coming up short of the LPGA 72-hole scoring record of 27 under, but it was enough to edge Buhai, who closed with a 67. The win was the third of Kirk's career but her first since the 2010 Navistar LPGA Classic, a span of 152 starts.  So much hard work and patience,  Kirk said.  I had a rough couple years like 2015 and 2016, and just an amazing team behind me. My husband has been 100 percent supportive the whole time. I can't put it into words. It's just a great feeling.  Kirk began the final round at Thornberry Creek with a four-stroke lead and was challenged by Buhai before making a 10-foot birdie putt on the par-4 18th hole to finally secure the victory.  When we got even, I just knew I had to ... keep hitting the shots, and I did that,  Buhai said.  There's not much more you can do, and she made a birdie straight away. She bounced back well. Yeah, I got within close range, but it was a great birdie on 18.  Kirk's final round mixed six birdies with four bogeys.  Ashleigh played great all day,  said Kirk, who qualified for next week's U.S. Women's Open with the victory.  I put the pressure on her. Pretty fun finish there. I knew I had to make it.  Buhai moved to 20 under with four birdies on the front nine, but she parred the next eight holes before closing with a birdie on No. 18. Her runner-up finish was a career best.  We both played great this week,  Buhai said.  Today, 5 under, no bogeys. I had three lip-outs on the back nine, but I hit the putts and the shots that I had to just keep hitting.  Sei Young Kim of South Korea finished third at 20 under after a 63. Pornanong Phatlum of Thailand shot the best round of the week with a 10-under 62 and took fourth at 19 under a career-best 62.

There were plenty of reasons for Knebel and the Milwaukee Brewers to be sweating after nearly four hours of stressful pitching at Yankee Stadium. This time, Knebel was not discussing the disappointment of giving up a game-winning homer but the joy of getting through a tough inning. Knebel put an emphatic end to a successful first half for the Brewers when he struck out the side in the ninth inning to secure a 5-3 victory over the New York Yankees on Sunday.  I'm still kind of sweating right now, a lot of pitches,  Knebel said. A day after ending a 16-pitch outing by leaving a 1-0 fastball up for Clint Frazier to hit a game-winning three-run homer, Knebel threw 33 more pitches to six hitters and posted his third save of at least four outs. Little about Knebel's 14th save in 18 opportunities was easy as he entered with Chase Headley on second base. He promptly walked Ji-Man Choi but kept the two-run lead by getting Tyler Wade on a groundout. The ninth was even more challenging for the All-Star right-hander. He opened the inning by walking Brett Gardner and the Yankees had three chances to at least tie the score. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at YankeesMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchHe quickly got ahead in the count against Aaron Judge and used his fastball to get the first strikeout. Knebel then fell behind Didi Gregorius on a 3-0 count but used another fastball to get the strikeout before ending Milwaukee's ninth win in 11 games by striking out Gary Sanchez looking at another fastball.  I was hoping I could get Corey back out there today,  Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said.  It's great for Corey. He's been so all on it all year. He had a little hiccup yesterday but got right back out there and him proving it again and he did.  Knebel's escape act against the middle of New York's lineup capped a stellar showing for a bullpen with a 4.09 ERA. After Jimmy Nelson (8-4) allowed a three-run homer to Frazier among three runs and seven hits in five-plus innings, three relievers preceded Knebel and encountered tough situations. Carlos Torres nearly gave up the lead, but Headley's drive down the right field line was ruled a foul ball after Milwaukee challenged. Torres then struck out Headley and Oliver Drake stranded two in the ninth. After Drake allowed a single to Gardner, he walked Judge but preserved the lead, aided by right fielder Domingo Santana's leaping catch on Gary Sanchez's liner. Hughes threw two wild pitches in the eighth, but right before Knebel entered he struck out Frazier.  Today's game was really about the bullpen,  Nelson said.  They came in and did a great job and got out of some jams. Hats off to those guys. That's their game today.  Travis Shaw helped the Brewers get the ball to Knebel by hitting a three-run homer in the first inning off Masahiro Tanaka (7-8) and an RBI single in the fifth off left-handed reliever Chasen Shreve. He tied a season high with his third four-RBI game and hit his fifth first-inning homer. Stephen Vogt added a second-nning solo homer off Tanaka.  We wanted to win the series, obviously, and finish out on a good note,  Shaw said.  For Corey to bounce back today, that was big. Big first inning for us, getting out ahead and taking the momentum away from them. It was kind of a perfect day all around.  Frazier's three-run homer was among few highlights for the Yankees, who went 1-for-16 with runners in scoring position and struck out 14 times in their 18th loss in 25 games since June 12.  You go 1-for-16, it's pretty hard to win a game,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. Tanaka concluded an uneven first half by allowing five runs and six hits in 4 1/3 innings. It was the seventh time he allowed at least five runs and seventh time that Tanaka allowed multiple home runs.  My off-speed stuff wasn't crisp,  Tanaka said through a translator.  The fastball command wasn't good. I got hurt with those two home runs. I definitely wasn't as crisp as I wanted to be.  Shaw entered 2-for-12 against Tanaka, but after Jonathan Villar and Eric Thames opened the game with singles, the third baseman slugged a full-count slider into the right-center field seats for his 19th homer. Vogt made it 4-0 by driving a 1-1 sinker over the center-field fence for his fourth homer since being claimed off waivers from Oakland. Frazier ended Nelson's shutout bid in the fourth by sending a first-pitch slider over the center-field wall. NOTES: Milwaukee LF Ryan Braun (left calf tightness) did not play after exiting Saturday's game following the top of the eighth inning. He is considered day to day. ...

Most of the last six months on his desk calendar is marked green, indicating visits to the 12 plants of Lupin, India's No. 2 drugmaker, where Desai is a senior quality control executive. Only one day is red - a day off. That's what is needed these days to satisfy the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that standards are being met.  In this sector, you're only as good as your last inspection,  Desai said in his office in suburban Mumbai. Often dubbed  the pharmacy of the world , India is home to the most FDA-approved plants outside of the United States and supplies about 40 percent of the $70 billion worth of generic drugs sold in the country. But sanctions and bans have badly damaged India's reputation and slowed growth in the $16 billion sector. Drug exports fell in the fiscal year ending in March 2017. More than 40 plants have been banned by the FDA for issues ranging from data fraud to hygiene since India's then-largest drugmaker Ranbaxy was pulled up for serious violations in 2008. Drug companies have spent millions of dollars on training, new equipment and foreign consultants. Yet the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance of the top 20 firms says its members still need at least five more years to get manufacturing standards and data reliability up to scratch. The case of Lupin, whose shares are down about 27 percent since 2015 compared to a 13 percent drop in the Nifty pharma index, shows why. The FDA is in the next few months expected to clear Lupin's Goa plant, which supplies around a third of its U.S. sales, of problems found in 2015, Desai said. However, the agency also published a new notice just last week citing issues with data storage at its plant in Pithampur, central India. If companies want to continue to sell into the world's biggest health care market, they must keep constant vigilance. Many in the industry expect to see consolidation among manufacturers after a wave of mergers among U.S. drug distributors and increasing price pressures.  A lot of companies will struggle to meet the requirements that are the need of the day, and I would expect to see additional consolidation on the supply side,  Lupin’s Chief Executive Vinita Gupta told analysts last month. Asked about Lupin's case, the FDA said in a statement it did not  comment on compliance matters , but said generally:  India’s regulatory infrastructure must keep pace to ensure that relevant quality and safety standards are met.  Form 483 India has its own standards body, the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), which maintains that its quality controls are stringent enough to ensure drugs are safe.  India's standards are different,  CDSCO head G.N. Singh said in an interview in his New Delhi office.  Indian companies are compliant with our manufacturing standards. We cannot regulate them according to the U.S. standards.  The FDA has taken matters into its own hands and gradually expanded in India to more than a dozen full-time staff. Inspections are frequent and increasingly unannounced. If the agency finds problems, it issues a Form 483 – a notice outlining the violations - which if not resolved can lead to a  warning letter  and in worst case, a ban. Violations range from hygiene, such as rat traps and dirty laboratories, to inadequate controls on systems that store data, leaving it open to tampering. None of the violations the FDA has cited in India have explicitly said the drugs are unsafe, and when companies are banned by the FDA they can sell into other markets, including in the developing world, until the bans are lifted. There are also no studies showing that the drugs have harmed anyone in the world. But by definition, the notices are issued when the FDA finds conditions that might harm public health. Don't Tell Anyone Industry watchers say Lupin, which specialises in oral contraceptives and drugs for diabetes and hypertension, is doing better than most. So far none of its infractions have extended to a ban. On a recent visit by Reuters to its Goa plant, blue-uniformed employees could be seen working on giant machines, then making notes in hardbound registers. These are being phased out as Lupin transitions to more secure e-files. Employees are often videotaped to ensure they follow standard operating procedure. Manufacturers have cut back to focus on quality over quantity: five years ago, Lupin was making one billion pills a month at one of its Goa plants. Now it makes just 450 million. Both the company and employees needed to be willing to acknowledge errors, Desai said. The first impulse in the past was often  don't tell anyone , he said.  We're humans after all, not robots. We make mistakes,  said Amol Kolatkar, a production head at the Goa site. As recently as three years ago, training was a  formality , Desai said. Now, when an error is traced to an employee, the entire team undergoes fresh training.  I have worked at a pharma company before, but this is the first time I went through such a training,  said another Lupin quality control officer, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media.  They told us a lot about the Lupin culture and quality, and also stressed on good manufacturing practices.  The quality control role is key.  They (Lupin) have had a practice where company’s quality heads report directly to Nilesh Gupta (the managing director),  said Amey Chalke, an analyst at HDFC Securities.  Some other companies have also started doing that now.  The companies also have to be willing to spend big. Lachman, PwC and Boston Consulting conduct mock audits at the Goa plant every three to six months, at a cost of up to $400 an hour.  These days the FDA is giving us 483 on small, small things,  a third quality control officer said.  So we are always auditing.

The interest rate could be a lot higher after three years, but there's also a chance that the interest would still be cheap because finance companies are competing fiercely,  said Fu, who works in Hong Kong's financial services industry.  There's risk but there's also an upside. It's a good investment opportunity.  With traditional financing drying up in Hong Kong at a time when property prices are at a record high, home buyers like Fu are looking to non-bank lenders, many of them the financing arms of developers, to get in on the boom. Under Hong Kong law, these  shadow banks  can loan legally as long as interest rates do not exceed 60 percent per annum, according to industry officials and an official document seen by Reuters. The system is a life-saver for those who have found it harder to secure loans, particularly mortgages, due to curbs imposed by the central bank to dampen home prices, which are up 137 percent since the start of the financial crisis in 2008. But it also puts the broader system at risk if property prices turn around or borrowers start to default, because many of these lenders have themselves raised financing by borrowing from big banks or selling bonds. Because they are not banks -- they do not take deposits -- shadow lenders in Hong Kong are monitored by the police, and not financial regulators. The manager of one such lender said his firm, founded by a mainland Chinese entrepreneur, lends on average HK$8 million to HK$10 million for a first mortgage and up to HK$300 million for a villa, with down payments much smaller than a regular bank.  I can lend you 90 percent for a property, for example, no problem,  he told Reuters from his office in the Central business district, asking not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media. The share of shadow banks in Hong Kong's mortgage business is still small - in the low single digits - but industry officials say it is growing fast, up at least 30 to 40 percent a year over the last couple of years. That's no surprise given that mainstream lenders like HSBC and Standard Chartered have capped mortgages at just 51 percent at the end of last year, according to Standard & Poor's. That was after the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) gradually lowered the property financing ratio, raised interest rates, hiked the risk capital buffer for new loans and discouraged banks from making large loans to developers with big mortgage lending operations.  Regulators have got us to this situation,  said Richard Wong, a professor in the Hong Kong University's school of economics and finance.  The money lenders are not deposit-taking companies ... but that doesn't mean there is no risk because the (property) market could correct.  Monitoring Closely While non-bank financing companies play a major role in mortgage lending in many developed economies, regulators have been tightening their scrutiny of these lenders, especially after the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States. The Hong Kong regulator, the HKMA, told Reuters it had given guidance to banks to ensure they boost their  credit risk management  when it comes lending to property developers.  The HKMA will continue to monitor the property and mortgage markets closely, and will introduce appropriate measures to safeguard the stability of the banking system as necessary,  it said in a statement. In addition to the financing units of developers, another 1,800 entities have a license to operate in Hong Kong as money lenders, the bulk of them in mortgages, double the number five years ago, according to the official Companies Registry data. Another 100 firms had applied for a money lender's license as of end-May this year, according to a review of data at the Hong Kong Companies Registry. Mortgage loans granted by the dozen or so financing units of Sino-Land Company Ltd more than doubled in 2016 from the year before to HK$1.02 billion, according to its annual report, in a year when turnover nearly halved and profit dived by nearly 25 percent. Other top developers, including Cheung Kong Property Holdings Ltd, controlled by Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing, Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd and Henderson Land Development Co Ltd also have financing units. Loans from one of Sun Hung Kai financing arms for its latest development in the New Territories started at 80 percent of the property price and went up to 120 percent for people who already had a home and wanted to upgrade, according to its price list. About 5,000 people applied to buy the 234 units put on sale on July 1 in the first phase of the development, where a 721-sq-feet unit costs as much as HK$10 million. Interest rates from shadow lenders vary widely, but typically start at around 5 percent and go up to 20 percent or higher, versus 2-3 percent at regular banks, which also lend for longer terms of 25-30 years, industry sources said. Sun Hung Kai told Reuters it was always  prudent :  While the package helps our buyers, it does not affect the company's financial position as the loan exposure is very small and well-secured.  Sino-Land, Cheung Kong and Henderson did not respond to requests for comment. The Hong Kong police, the de-facto regulator, said it did not have any data on buyer complaints against non-bank financing companies, but added that it maintained a  close liaison  with the financial industry.  Enforcement action will be taken by the police if there is evidence implicating any money lender engaged in illegal practices,  it said in a statement. Some bankers and analysts say the growth of shadow banking in the mortgage sector could be a ticking time bomb, especially if there's a correction in the market, as is widely expected. The potential for defaults was also a concern although the delinquency ratio in the main banking sector, at least, remains low at just 0.03 percent in May, unchanged from April, according to the HKMA's latest available data. Brokerage Nomura expects prices to peak in the first half of this year, and said that local economic fundamentals do not support further price rises.  (The property market) is very expensive ... it goes up very fast, (but) it actually corrects also very fast,  said David Chiu, chair of realtor Far East Consortium International .

By Meng Meng and Josephine Mason BEIJING, July 7 (Reuters) - Mining and electric utility executives in China are preparing for a possible government intervention into coal markets after prices hit the 600 yuan ($88.25) a tonne threshold the state planner said would trigger steps to cool prices. A prolonged heatwave across northern China, hydropower cuts in the south, a fresh crackdown on mine safety and imports curbs have triggered a weeks-long rally in the world's top buyer of the fuel. On Friday, the most-active futures prices hit 598.6 yuan ($88.04) per tonne. That's up 18 percent since mid-May. In January, state economic planner the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a document it is comfortable with a price of 470 yuan ($69.12) to 570 yuan ($83.82 )per tonne and will use measures to cool the market if it rises above 600 yuan. But spot physical prices offered by major producers, such as Shenhua, ChinaCoal and Shandong Energy, are already at 600 yuan, sources with the three companies said driven by strong demand.  Our coal mines are almost working around the clock now,  said Wang Binghua, president of State Power Investment Corp, on the sideline of a company news conference this week. It has 81 million tonnes of annual coal capacity. It is not clear what level of intervention the government would consider. The NDRC may try to force miners to cut prices or set limits on the amount of inventory utilities and trading companies can hold to prevent them from buying extra volumes that could push prices higher or create shortages, according to four mining company executives and one power company executive. At least three of the top four mining firms, including ChinaCoal, Shenhua and Yitai, have halted spot sales to meet increasing demand from long-term contracts with clients, sources with the three companies said. The NDRC, Shenhua, ChinaCoal, Shandong Energy and Yitai did not respond to requests for comments. Major utilities buy on long-term contracts at about 570 yuan ($83.83) per tonne, although the smaller plants and traders are exposed to the cash market. Analysts say utilities have about 20 days of inventory on hand, which is enough to see them through the busy summer months. Still, the price gains have tested Beijing's efforts to boost supplies, quell concerns about tightening availability during peak demand season and cool the red hot market. In a June 30 document, the NDRC asked miners to boost output as part of a series of steps to ensure power supplies over the summer.  Policy makers are trying to curb the rally in prices. But there is such a big demand for coal now that (Shenhua)'s spot prices has reached 600 yuan,  said a source from Shenhua. A senior official at top utility Huaneng said a stable coal price was an increasingly important issue ahead of the Communist Party Congress this fall.  Our internal discussion with NDRC officials showed that the agency is keen on stabilising prices and making sure utilities get enough supply during summer in preparation for the Congress meeting,  the official said.

Starting Sunday, the partnerships will allow online merchants using Stripe to integrate the ability for Chinese users to pay with Alipay and WeChat Pay on their websites, the company said. Stripe hopes the integration will help boost its revenues by allowing clients to tap China's vast consumer market, where credit cards account for only a fraction of online spending, the company said. Alipay is the flagship payment service of Ant Financial, the financial affiliate of major Chinese ecommerce company Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA.N) and has over 520 million users. WeChat Pay has more than 600 million users and is the payment app of entertainment and social network firm Tencent Holdings (0700.HK).  If you are an internet business this unlocks a new vast customer base,  John Collison, Stripe's president and co-founder, said in an interview. In turn, Chinese consumers will have expanded choice as to which international online merchants they can purchase products and services from, he added.  Founded by brothers John and Patrick Collison in 2010, Stripe provides technology that enables merchants in 25 countries to accept payments online. It charges a fee on each payments transactions processed through its platform. A WeChat Pay system is demonstrated at a canteen  in Guangzhou, China May 9, 2017.

Handout via ReutersOne of the most valuable venture-backed financial technology companies globally, Stripe has risen in popularity among software developers and online merchants because of its ease of use.  It is among the cohort of young fintech companies seeking to reinvent the payments landscape by taking better advantage of digital technologies to offer more user-friendly financial services and products. It had previously partnered with Alipay to enable only the U.S. merchants on its platform to integrate the Chinese payment service. The new global partnership builds on that experience.  Demand for services from Chinese consumers is at all-time high,  Souheil Badran, president of Alipay for North America, said in an interview. The new partnerships will connect them to hundreds of thousands of Stripe-powered businesses around the world, he added.

Trump's then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also attended the meeting at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, two weeks after Trump won the Republican nomination, the Times reported.   In a statement quoted by the Times and later made available to Reuters and other media outlets, Donald Trump Jr.  acknowledged meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.        After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,  the statement said. Clinton was the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.   Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.  Trump Jr. said Veselnitskaya then turned the conversation to the adoption of Russian children and a U.S. law blackisting Russians linked to alleged human-rights abuses. President Trump was  not aware of and did not attend  the meeting, Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump's legal team, said in an emailed statement. Trump Jr. said he was asked to attend the meeting  with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign  at the request of an acquaintance he knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant.   I asked Jared and Paul to attend, but told them nothing of the substance,  he said.

As it ended, my acquaintance apologized for taking up our time. That was the end of it and there was no further contact or follow-up of any kind. My father knew nothing of the meeting or these events.   The New York Times report said Trump Jr. was promised damaging information about Clinton before agreeing to meet with the lawyer. It cited three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it. The Times first reported on the meeting on Saturday, after which Trump Jr. issued a statement confirming that it took place, but made no mention of the Clinton aspect. Slideshow (2 Images)Representatives for Manafort and Kushner did not respond to requests for comment. Allegations of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia have cast a shadow over Donald Trump's first five months in office. A federal special counsel and several congressional committees are investigating possible contacts between the campaign and Russian representatives as part of a larger probe into allegations that Moscow meddled in the election. The June meeting was the first confirmed private meeting between members of the president's inner circle and a Russian national, the Times reported, citing confidential government records and interviews with people familiar with the documents. The revelations come after President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the allegations of election meddling during the summit of leaders from the Group of 20 major economies in Hamburg, Germany. The Kremlin has denied U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that Moscow tried to tilt the election in Trump's favor, using such means as hacking into the emails of senior Democrats.  Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion.

Sixty days after Macron became France's youngest-ever president, the chief executives gathered in the southern town of Aix-en-Provence said they had sensed a radical change in the country's image abroad.  The whole world admires France today. There is renewed confidence, optimism about the country,  Patrick Pouyanne, the head of oil major Total, (TOTF.PA), France's largest company, told reporters.  What I expect from this government is that it maintains this confidence, this optimism, so the French start spending more and companies start investing.  Although Macron's government has yet to pass any concrete measures, it outlined its action plan in policy speeches last  week, and has begun talks with unions to pass an extensive reform of French labor regulations.  I think this new president and his government are making an extremely positive start,  Isabelle Kocher of gas utility ENGIE (ENGIE.PA) told Reuters at the summit often referred to as a  mini-Davos .

France went from being labeled the sick man of Europe to being seen as the savior of Europe,  a politician who sits on the board of several French companies said at one of the cafes lining the town's sunny streets. Tax Cut Debates If the government's announcement last Tuesday that some tax cuts would be delayed - including exemptions to a wealth tax and the introduction of a flat tax on capital income of 30 percent - did not draw much criticism in public, it had some bosses bristling in private. One participant in the conference's exclusive late-evening cocktails told Reuters he heard a CEO tell a Finance Ministry official that Macron should do away with his 50 billion euro investment plan and cut taxes instead.   We don't want to pay more taxes later,  the French CEO said, according to the witness of the scene who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversation was private.  There are some debates about the government's tax measures, if they'll be done now or if it'll wait because it has no money,  UBS' (UBSG.S) head of French operations, Jean-Frederic de Leusse, told Reuters.   On Sunday, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire seemed to suggest the delays were still the subject of discussions in government. But when pressed, French CEOs who in previous gatherings complained loudly about a tax burden, which was the EU's heaviest last year, refused to blame the government.  Let's not start criticizing,  Total's Pouyanne said.  Let's give them a bit of time. If there were a magic potion, it would have been used a long time ago.  The chief executive of the country's flagship airline, Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA), concurred.  Like all decision-makers, the government has to deal with contradicting demands. Respecting a certain number of European rules, so that our partners can take us more seriously, is important,  Jean-Marc Janaillac told Reuters.  If the price we have to pay is a slightly delayed time frame, that doesn't seem to be a major inconvenience for me compared to its advantages,  he added. France's top central bankers agreed the government was right to prioritize deficit reduction over tax cuts so that France can, for the first time in a decade, bring its deficit below the European Union's 3 percent of GDP ceiling. ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said France's respect for the rules would help discussions the government hopes to launch about common budget measures in the euro zone.  We're all for tax cuts, but let's not equate reform with immediate, unfunded tax cuts,  Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau told the conference on Sunday.

And if a Ross start falls on a Sunday afternoon, the other team may as well pack their bags and head home. That is actually what the Braves did after Sunday's game, as the first-place Washington Nationals scored three runs in the first inning and defeated Atlanta 10-5 in the last game before the All-Star break. Washington, now 9 1/2 games ahead of Atlanta, has scored 95 runs in the nine starts that Ross has made at Nationals Park this year.  We are capable of exploding for runs,  Nationals manager Dusty Baker said.  We had a good first half. We have to improve our bullpen efficiency. We just have to tighten up a few things.  With Ross on the mound, the Nationals scored 23 runs at home against the New York Mets on Sunday, April 28, 18 runs against the Cincinnati Reds at home on Sunday, June 25, and 11 runs at home on Tuesday, July 4, against the Mets. All three of those were day games as well. The bottom part of the batting order delivered for the Nationals, as No. 6 hitter Anthony Rendon, No. 7 Matt Wieters and No. 8 Chris Heisey all had RBIs.  It is not a bad place to hit behind those guys,  Wieters said of Bryce Harper, Ryan Zimmerman, Daniel Murphy and Rendon. Related CoveragePreview: Braves at NationalsAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchHeisey made just his third start of the year in left field after he came off the disabled list Friday.  I felt like I was in a good place all day,  he said.  It gives us some confidence going into the break. As a ballclub, we feel we could have a bigger lead  in the division. But this time Ross was not able to enjoy the offensive outburst, as he left with one out in the top of the fourth with the score tied at 3. Ross, who had thrown 63 pitches, was removed because of triceps tendinitis and was getting an MRI exam after the game, according to Baker. Rendon was 2-for-3 with two RBIs, Wieters drove in three runs and Murphy was 2-for-5 with two RBIs as the bottom part of the order lifted Washington. The Nationals are 52-36 and the Braves are 42-45.  All in all, it was a good first half,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  Realistically, we could have been over .500 this half.  The winning pitcher was Matt Grace (1-0), who came on in the fourth and allowed two runs (one earned) in 2 2/3 innings.  I was just attacking guys and getting ground balls,  Grace said. Washington scored three runs in the first as Zimmerman had a sacrifice fly and Rendon, hitting sixth in the lineup, added a two-run double. The Braves scored three of their own in the third as Freddie Freeman (two hits) hit a three-run homer to left to make it 3-3 against Ross. Heisey had an RBI double in the fourth, just missing a three-run homer, to give the Nationals a 4-3 edge. Wieters added a two-run single in the fifth against Ian Krol to push Washington's lead to 6-3. Atlanta's Johan Camargo (3-for-3, walk) crushed his first major league homer, a solo shot off Grace, to pull the Braves within 6-4 in the sixth. Nick Markakis drove in run on a fielder's choice to make it 6-5. But Wieters delivered a sacrifice fly in the seventh off reliever Jose Ramirez to drive in Rendon for a 7-5 cushion before Harper (2-for-4) drove in a run with a single in the eighth and Murphy added a two-run double to make it 10-5. Atlanta starter Sean Newcomb (1-4), facing Washington for the first time, went four innings and allowed four hits, four runs and four walks with seven strikeouts while throwing 97 pitches.  His stuff was good today. He is learning. The walks were an issue,  Snitker said. Wilmer Difo was also 2-for-4 for Washington and Matt Adams had two hits for the Braves.  All in all, it was a positive first half,  Snitker said of his rebuilding club. NOTES: The Washington, D.C., Sports of Hall of Fame recognized nine new inductees before the game. The list included former Washington Redskins standout Mike Nelms, former University of Maryland and Washington Bullets basketball star Tom McMillen, former NFL commissioner and Georgetown University graduate Paul Tagliabue and ESPN's Tony Kornheiser, a former columnist for The Washington Post. ...

The Sunday Times reported that American investment firm Iconiq Capital had held talks with a number of buyout firms about a possible move for the club known as Spurs. It said the San Francisco fund manages the wealth of several Silicon Valley billionaires, including the founder of Facebook. In 2001 Bahamas-based Joe Lewis bought Tottenham through investment vehicle ENIC, which owns 85.55 percent of the club. Tottenham finished second in the Premier League last season behind London rivals Chelsea to again qualify for the lucrative Champions League, European soccer's elite club competition. Spurs are building a 61,500-seat stadium on their existing White Hart Lane site for 800 million pounds and will use the national stadium at Wembley this season while the new ground is constructed for the club to use from the 2018-19 campaign. Tottenham said on their website (www.tottenhamhotspur.com) on Sunday:  The club engaged Rothschild to secure the funding for the new stadium. As expected many proposals came forward including bank debt and equity investment.  The club announced on 31 May 2017 the completion of the bank debt financing for the new stadium with a consortium of banks involving Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and HSBC Bank plc.  The Board believes this was the optimum solution in the interests of fans, employees and shareholders and for the continued development of the club. The Board is not in any discussions relating to a takeover offer for the club.  Tottenham announced on May 31 that the club had signed a 400 million pounds, five-year loan to help finance the cost of building the new stadium, which is being purpose-built to also stage National Football League (NFL) games. $1 = 0.7764 pounds Editing by Andrew Both","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-england-tot-mergers-idUSL4N1K00E2"},

LOUIS -- The Memphis Redbirds are tied for the top record in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. Some of their top players are helping the St. Louis Cardinals feel good about where they're headed going to the All-Star break. Tommy Pham, Paul DeJong and Luke Voit, who all started the season in Memphis, each homered on Sunday as St. Louis finished the unofficial first half of the big-league season with a 6-0 thumping of the New York Mets at Busch Stadium. Pham belted his 11th homer in the third, a two-run shot down the right field line that gave the Cardinals (43-45) a 3-0 lead. DeJong walloped a 434-foot blast to left-center an inning later, capping an epic weekend in which he went 9-for-12 with four doubles and three homers. Voit finished the scoring in the sixth, leading off with his third homer of the year down the right-field line. The trio combined for six hits as St. Louis won for the 10th time in 15 games, finishing its homestand at 6-4. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at CardinalsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatch It doesn't surprise me,  Pham said of DeJong and Voit.  They asked me when I was called up who was ready and those were the two names I mentioned. I've seen them do it in Triple-A.  The emergence of the Memphis trio will certainly leave manager Mike Matheny with some interesting decisions when the season resumes Friday night in Pittsburgh. With 74 games remaining, the Cardinals sit 5 1/2 games behind first place Milwaukee in the National League Central. Pham has been arguably the team's best player since he was called up in early May. DeJong's play forced the team to play him every day at shortstop instead of 2016 NL All-Star Aledmys Diaz, who's now toiling in Memphis. Voit has 12 hits since being called up two weeks ago, eight for extra bases. They spearheaded an attack that sent New York starter Steven Matz (2-2) to the showers before the fifth inning was over. Matz, who entered with a 17-inning scoreless streak, was charged with seven hits and five runs in 4 1/3 innings, walking one and fanning one. St. Louis made him work hard in the 94-degree heat. Matz threw 27 pitches in the first, allowing a run on Jedd Gyorko's infield out. He was up to 80 by the fourth inning's end and finished with 86.  The guys had a nice approach and knew what they wanted to do,  Matheny said.  They had an aggressive approach and they capitalized on some mistakes.  Meanwhile, Lance Lynn (7-6) gave the Mets (39-47) virtually nothing over his seven innings. Lynn allowed only three singles and a walk, fanning two in his longest outing since going eight innings May 23 at the Los Angeles Dodgers. Lynn needed only 93 pitches to collect his outs against an opponent which spent most of the day appearing as though they had started the All-Star break in spirit. He notched seven outs on first or second-pitch swings.  I'd say that over the years, I've been able to get them into swing mode early in the game,  he said.  If you can get anybody into swing mode, you can kind of expand off the plate and have success. Today it worked out well.  In contrast, nothing worked well for New York, which enters the All-Star break a dozen games behind the Washington Nationals in the NL East.  We're not hitting, we're not pitching. When you don't pitch, that game looks rugged. When you don't hit, they look even worse,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.

The Toronto Blue Jays found out all about it Sunday afternoon when the Astros pounded out 17 hits, including five home runs, in a 19-1 victory. It was the largest margin of victory in Astros' franchise history. Carlos Correa hit two home runs, had a career-best five RBIs and matched his career best with four hits.  That was incredible today,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  We really were explosive today. We never stopped. We have days like that where we just come at you for nine full innings. We put a lot of big innings together.  Yulieski Gurriel, Jose Altuve and Evan Gattis also homered for the Astros, who gained a split of the four-game series that is followed by the All-Star break. Altuve had three hits for his fifth consecutive game, and Gattis matched his career best with four RBIs. Gattis has an 11-game hitting streak.  We don't want to give up at-bats,  Correa said.  So one through nine everybody's having a good approach out there and trying to make the best out of every at-bat. Felt good at the plate today, so hopefully I can carry that into the second half.  Toronto's Ezequiel Carrera hit his career-best seventh homer of the season with two outs in the ninth against Francis Martes. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at Blue JaysHouston Astros - PlayerWatchToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatch Any time you have a game like that, you try flush it pretty quick,  said Blue Jays first baseman Justin Smoak, who was 1-for-3 with a walk.  We have this break here, it's much needed for a lot of the guys in here, and we'll be ready to go afterwards.  I feel we've been playing pretty good baseball. That team over there is really good, to get two wins against them is good.  Brad Peacock (7-1) allowed five hits and five walks in six scoreless innings to post his fourth straight win and equal his longest outing of the season.  Felt great,  Peacock said.  Kind of struggled there in the fourth (walking the bases loaded) but made some pitches and got out of it and Gattis did a great job calling pitches that inning and getting me out of it.  Toronto starter J.A. Happ (3-6) allowed seven hits, three walks and six runs (two earned) in four innings.  I'm disappointed,  Happ said.  I wasn't very crisp today. Against that lineup, especially, you need to be. So that's a bummer.  Josh Donaldson had two hits, a walk and two errors for Toronto (41-47). Two umpires' calls in the top of the top of the first were reversed by video review. George Springer picked up an infield hit after being originally called out at first base on a superb bare-handed grab and throw by Donaldson. Altuve followed by grounding into a double play. After Correa singled and Gattis walked, Marwin Gonzalez hit a bloop to center that was originally ruled a hit before the video showed that Kevin Pillar made a diving catch. The Astros (60-29) scored five runs (one earned) in the top of the second inning. Gurriel hit his 11th homer of the season with one out. Alex Bregman doubled and scored on a throwing error by Donaldson on Springer's two-out grounder. Altuve followed with his 13th homer and Correa also homered. Another call was overturned by a review in the bottom of the third when Donaldson was ruled to be out at second trying for a double. He originally was called safe. The Astros added a run in the fourth on two walks followed by an infield hit by Correa. Lucas Harrell replaced Happ in the fifth and gave up a three-run homer to Gattis in the sixth. The eighth homer of the season for the Astros catcher followed singles by Springer and Altuve. Jake Marisnick hit an RBI double and pinch-hitter Norichika Aoki followed with an RBI single in the seventh against Aaron Loup in the sixth-run seventh. The hits were preceded by a hit batter and the second error of the game by Donaldson. Ryan Tepera allowed an RBI single by Altuve and the 20th homer of the season by Correa, a three-run blast. Joe Biagini allowed four runs in the top of the ninth on two walks, a double by Gattis and an infield single by Marwin Gonzales that included a throwing error by second baseman Darwin Barney and a wild pitch. NOTES: Houston has doubled in 46 consecutive games, surpassing the franchise record of 38 set July 27-Sept. 6, 1977. The streak is the fourth longest in major league history since 1913 and the longest since the Tampa Bay Rays also doubled in 46 straight games in 2001-02. ... Toronto 1B Justin Smoak enters the All-Star break with 23 homers and 56 RBIs. His career high for RBIs in a complete season is 59 in 2015 and he already has set a career best in homers. ... Houston 2B Jose Altuve had his fifth consecutive three-hit game Sunday, a franchise record. No other Astros player had more than three three-hit games. The last major league player with a longer streak than four was 3B George Brett of the Kansas City Royals at six games in 1976.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-astros-bluejays-writethru-idUSMTZED79UCWVV1"},

Kuhl suddenly had to pitch on two days' rest. His teammates made sure his day got a little easier. The Pittsburgh Pirates erupted for 10 runs in the first inning to back up Kuhl on the way to a 14-3 rout of the Cubs on Sunday to conclude the first half of the season.  That's big for Chad, a couple days rest, to do what he did,  Pirates center fielder Andrew McCutchen said.  That was big for us. You hate for anything like that to happen, but he stepped in and did a great job for us.  We were able to score a lot of runs for him. If anything, it should've helped him breathe a little bit. Just hope Jamo is alright. It was a good win for us.  Kuhl learned around 9 a.m. that he might have to start in place of Taillon, who arrived at Wrigley Field experiencing intense flu-like symptoms. Taillon experienced the symptoms again during his warm-up, head athletic trainer Todd Tomczyk said, so the right-hander was officially scratched about a half-hour before the first pitch. Taillon (5-2, 2.73 ERA) is listed as day to day. He is 3-1 with a 1.98 ERA in five starts since he came off the disabled list June 12 after undergoing testicular cancer surgery on May 8. Taillon's illness is unrelated to the cancer, Tomczyk said. Kuhl allowed one run and two hits in three innings. He most recently pitched Thursday, allowing three runs (two earned) in seven innings against the Philadelphia Phillies. The Pirates went with Kuhl because Sunday was his day to throw on the side, and Gerrit Cole was unavailable because he threw a side session Saturday, manager Clint Hurdle said. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at CubsPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchChicago Cubs - PlayerWatch I lifted yesterday, so I was a little sore. Nothing out of the ordinary,  Kuhl said.  Other than that, felt fine.  McCutchen followed Francisco Cervelli's third career grand slam with his 17th home run to stretch the lead to 10 and knock Cubs starter Jon Lester out of the game with two outs in the first inning.  It was awesome to go up there and have that confidence of 10 runs,  Kuhl said.  It really picked us up.  Lester (5-6) allowed four earned runs and six hits in the shortest outing of his career. He walked three and struck out none, throwing 27 of his 53 pitches for strikes.  It pretty much speaks for itself. It's embarrassing,  Lester said. The reigning World Series champion Cubs (43-45) needed to win to enter the All-Star break with a .500 record. A year ago, they were 53-35 at this point.  I'm still very confident. I believe in our guys,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  I'm eager to see us coming out of the break.  The Pirates sent 15 batters to the plate in the first. Jose Osuna delivered a two-run double, Jordy Mercer hit a two-run single and Josh Bell added an RBI single while the Cubs committed two errors. It was the Pirates' highest-scoring inning since they put up 10 in the seventh against Colorado on May 17, 2009. Pittsburgh last scored 10 runs in a first inning on June 8, 1989, at Philadelphia.  To be able to do that and to be able to do it against a guy like Lester is great for us,  McCutchen said.  We didn't stop there in the first. We scored a few more runs, even late. It's good to go into the break on a high note like that.  The Pirates took two of three in the series to finish the first half of the season 42-47. A.J. Schugel (1-0) got the victory after allowing a run in three innings. The Pirates improved to 5-1 at Wrigley Field this season and lead the season series against the Cubs 7-5. The Cubs' Victor Caratini doubled for his first major league hit in the fifth inning. He also had an RBI double in the ninth. Mike Montgomery allowed two runs in three innings in relief of Lester, who gave up 10 runs in a game for the first time since July 22, 2012, against Toronto.  If I had a reason, it would've been fixed out there,  Lester said.  It's never a good time to have a bad start.  The Cubs chipped into the big lead with a run in the second and another in the fifth. But the Pirates added two runs in the fourth and another in the sixth. Josh Harrison hit his 10th home run in the ninth for Pittsburgh. NOTES: Pirates OF Starling Marte was 4-for-13 with one home run and three RBIs entering Sunday on a rehab assignment with Triple-A Indianapolis. He has been on the assignment since July 4 while he serves an 80-game suspension for a positive test for a performance-enhancing drug. Marte is eligible to return July 18. Manager Clint Hurdle said he has talked with the team and Marte about his return. ... INF/OF Josh Harrison is the Pirates' All-Star, and RHP Wade Davis will represent the Cubs at the All-Star Game on Tuesday in Miami. ...

Tweeting after his first meeting with President Vladimir Putin on Friday, Trump said now was the time to work constructively with Moscow, pointing to a ceasefire deal in southwest Syria that came into effect on Sunday.  Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded and safe,  he said following their talks at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Hamburg, Germany. Three Republican senators - Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John McCain of Arizona and Marco Rubio of Florida - blasted the idea.  It's not the dumbest idea I have ever heard but it's pretty close,  Graham told NBC's  Meet the Press  program, saying that Trump's apparent willingness to  forgive and forget  stiffened his resolve to pass legislation imposing sanctions on Russia.  There has been no penalty,  McCain, who chairs the Senate armed services committee, told CBS'  Face the Nation  program according to a CBS transcript.  Vladimir Putin ... got away with literally trying to change the outcome ... of our election.   Yes, it's time to move forward. But there has to be a price to pay,  he added. Rubio, on Twitter, said:  Partnering with Putin on a 'Cyber Security Unit' is akin to partnering with (Syrian President Bashar al) Assad on a 'Chemical Weapons Unit'.  Trump argued for rapprochement with Moscow in his campaign but has been unable to deliver because his administration has been dogged by investigations into the allegations of Russian interference in the election and ties with his campaign. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the matter, including whether there may have been any collusion on the part of Trump campaign officials, as are congressional committees including both the House and Senate intelligence panels. Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscow’s actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials say, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries despite Trump's suggestion that others could have been involved. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN's  State of the Union  program Russia could not be a credible partner in a cyber security unit.  If that’s our best election defense, we might as well just mail our ballot boxes to Moscow,  Schiff added. Separately, U.S. government officials said that a recent hack into business systems of U.S. nuclear power and other energy companies was carried out by Russian government hackers, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. 'Time to Move Forward' With Russia Trump said he  strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it.  He added:  We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!  In Trump's first attempt at ending the six-year Syrian civil war, the United States, Russia and Jordan on Friday reached a ceasefire and  de-escalation agreement  for southwestern Syria. The ceasefire was holding hours after it took effect on Sunday, a monitor and two rebel officials said. In another tweet, Trump contradicted his Secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, by saying  sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin. Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian & Syrian problems are solved!  The United States has imposed sanctions on Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Tillerson on Friday told reporters Trump had told Putin U.S. lawmakers were pushing for additional sanctions against Russia. The Senate has passed legislation which would put into law sanctions, including on mining and other industries, previously established via former President Barack Obama's executive orders. The bill must pass the House of Representatives before it could go to the White House for Trump's signature or veto. McCain criticized Tillerson for having said about Syria,  by and large, our (U.S. and Russian) objectives are exactly the same. How we get there, we each have a view. Maybe they have got the right approach and we have got the wrong approach.  Russia, and Iran, have backed keeping Assad in power. Trump, like his predecessor Barack Obama, has focused on fighting Islamic State, leaving for later the question of Assad's fate.  The Russians knew that Bashar al-Assad was going to use chemical weapons. And to say that maybe we have got the wrong approach?  McCain said. Asked if he regretted voting for Tillerson as secretary of state, he replied:  Sometimes I do.

Singapore overall refining margins to Dubai crude DUB-SIN-REF rose to $7.34 per barrel on July 6, the highest since Feb. 16, amid weaker crude prices and strong demand for oil product such as fuel oil, gasoil and jet fuel. Japanese refineries were mainly running at above 90 percent of their capacity from January to May this year compared with below 90 percent for the same period last year, according to data from the Petroleum Association of Japan. South Korean refineries had an even higher throughput of 99.1 percent for the January to May period compared with last year's 96.6 percent, data from Korea National Oil Corp showed.  (Margins) were strong because of tight regional inventories, and this shows how solid demand is,  said a source from a South Korean refinery who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.  There is little reason to trim down the run rates,  the source added. Asia's refinery run rates are expected to increase further in the second half, said Peter Lee, an oil and gas analyst at BMI Research, adding that the pace of incremental fuel demand growth will outstrip refining capacity additions over 2017-2019.  This will be positive for runs, before the market flips into a refining overcapacity from 2020,  he said. Strong margins were seen across three key refined products, fuel oil, jet fuel and diesel which make up about 40 to 70 percent of a refinery's output.  Fuel oil is often treated like a by-product but recently it became the same price or higher than Dubai crude, which means there is no reason to keep run rates low unless you have a planned maintenance,  said a trader with a Japanese refinery who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak with media. The cost of Dubai crude, the Middle East oil benchmark DUB-1M-A for Asia refiners that typically process Middle East grades, has dropped 11 percent to $47.11 per barrel since May 25, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said it would extend output cuts.  (The strength in margins) relies on (product) demand remaining strong and refinery maintenance, both planned and unplanned, remaining elevated. If either disappoint then margins are ripe for a correction,  said Virendra Chauhan, analyst at Energy Aspects.

The United States, Russia and Jordan reached the  de-escalation agreement,  which appeared to give Trump a diplomatic achievement at his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Germany this week.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said  calm prevailed  in the southwest since the truce began at noon (0900 GMT) on Sunday despite minor violations.  Combatants briefly exchanged fire in Deraa province and in Quneitra around midnight, but this  did not threaten the ceasefire,  said Observatory Director Rami Abdulrahman.     Major Issam al Rayes, spokesman of the Southern Front coalition of Western-backed rebel groups, said  a cautious calm  continued into the evening.  The situation is relatively calm,  Suhaib al-Ruhail, a spokesman for the Alwiyat al-Furqan faction in Quneitra, said earlier.  Another rebel official, in Deraa city, said there had been no significant fighting. It was quiet on the main Manshiya front near the border with Jordan, which he said had been the site of some of the heaviest army bombing in recent weeks.  Syrian ceasefire seems to be holding ... Good!  Trump tweeted on Sunday.  A Syrian official indicated that Damascus approved of the ceasefire deal, describing the government's silence over it as a  sign of satisfaction.   We welcome any step that would cease the fire and pave the way for peaceful solutions,  the government official told Reuters. A witness in Deraa said he had not seen warplanes in the sky or heard any fighting since noon.

Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!  A senior U.S. State Department official involved in the talks said further discussions would be necessary to decide crucial aspects of the agreement, including who will monitor its enforcement. Slideshow (8 Images)Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the truce included  securing humanitarian access and setting up contacts between the opposition in the region and a monitoring center that is being established in Jordan's capital.  Ahead of U.N.-based peace talks set to open on Monday, a spokesman for the opposition delegation said in Geneva the deal showed a  serious international effort to bring peace.   Russia has been waiting for an American strategy to crystallize vis-a-vis Syria,  said Yahya al-Aridi.  And we believe this is quite serious in part from the United States to broker such a ceasefire, and we want it to be extended to other parts of Syria, to all of it.  Several ceasefires have crumbled, however, since the onset of the conflict. With the help of Russian air power and Iranian-backed militias, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has put rebels at a disadvantage over the past year. The wide array of mostly Sunni rebels include jihadist factions and other groups supported by Turkey, the United States and Gulf monarchies. Earlier talks between the United States and Russia about a  de-escalation zone  in southwest Syria covered Deraa province on the border with Jordan, nearby Sweida and Quneitra, which borders the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Deraa and Quneitra are home to tens of thousands of people and form a center of the insurgency south of the Syrian capital, Damascus. Rebels said intense air strikes had pounded Deraa's opposition territory in recent weeks.  The multi-sided Syrian conflict, which grew out of popular protests against Assad's rule in 2011, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world's worst refugee crisis.

On Sunday, Mackanin did. He didn't want to forget all of the home runs his team hit. The Phillies launched six homers, their most in a game since 2004, and helped starting pitcher Jerad Eickhoff claim his first win of the season with a 7-1 win over the San Diego Padres. The Phillies (29-58), who got two home runs from Freddy Galvis, snapped a five-game losing streak and San Diego (38-50) saw its stretch of five wins in six games disrupted before the All-Star break.  We should have probably saved three of those home runs for another day,  Mackanin said. Eickhoff (1-7) turned in a solid outing in his first start since June 17. He was activated Sunday (back injury) and had one of his best performances. He tossed five shutout innings, tying a season-high with eight strikeouts while allowing five hits, walking one, hitting a batter with a pitch and generating a season-best 14 swing-and-misses.  It felt good to be back out there,  Eickhoff said.  The break allowed me to think a little more about my delivery and kind of reset. Things were going pretty well.  Trevor Cahill (3-3) was handed the loss in his second start since returning from a long stint on the disabled list. Cahill ran into trouble in the second inning. With one out, he left a sinker up in the zone that Nick Williams took the other way to left field for his first career home run. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at PhilliesSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchTwo batters later, Cahill elevated a cutter that Cameron Rupp belted to center field for a 2-0 Phillies lead. In the third, after Cahill hit leadoff man Aaron Altherr with a pitch, Galvis sent a two-run shot to the upper deck in right to push the Phillies' lead to 4-0. Meanwhile, Eickhoff was cruising. He struck out the side in the third and punched out another two in the fourth. In the fifth, though, the Padres started connecting. Cahill led of the inning with a single before leadoff hitter Wil Myers lined out to center. The next batter, Manuel Margot, hit a sharp single to center. Eickhoff, however, escaped trouble with two loud outs to get out of the inning unscathed. With the All-Star break looming and Eickhoff making his first start in a few weeks, Mackanin elected to pull him after five innings and 71 pitches.  He could've gone back out,  Mackanin said,  but I didn't want him to throw any more pitches.  Eickhoff said,  I understood going into the break we had a lot of pitchers hot and coming off the injury it wasn't surprising.  Cahill, too, pitched five innings. He allowed four runs andn six hits while striking out eight. He was done in by the three home runs.  He made some mistakes,  Padres manager Andy Green said of Cahill.  The worst one was a hanging slider to Rupp.  The Phillies didn't stop adding to their lead with Cahill gone. Odubel Herrera hit a solo homer in the sixth. Altherr and Galvis hit back-to-back home runs off reliever Phil Maton to up the lead to 7-0 in the seventh. That was more than enough to get a victory for Eickhoff, who became the first Phillies pitcher to go winless in his first 14 starts since Matt Beech in 1997.  The season tests you a little bit and you never know when that first one is going to come,  Eickhoff said.  Sometimes it's later than you'd like or than you'd want.  San Diego scored its only run off Hector Neris in the ninth inning. The Padres head to the All-Star break with the least amount of runs scored in baseball (312).  We need more competitive at-bats,  Green said.  More consistency.  On the opposing side, consistency has been something the Phillies have been searching for all year.  I think we can play this way in a lot more games,  Galvis said.  We feel like we can do much better.  It would be hard to be any better than they were on Sunday. NOTES: Phillies RHP Luis Garcia has not allowed a run in his last 12 2/3 innings. ... Major League Baseball's All-Star break begins Sunday night and play resumes Friday across the league. ... Both teams are sending a reliever to the All-Star game as their only representative. San Diego is sending LHP Brad Hand and the Phillies' representative is RHP Pat Neshek. ... The Phillies open the second half with a six-game road trip to Milwaukee and Miami.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Brad Miller had hit only two home runs in 147 at-bats this season, after getting 30 last year, but he came through with a huge one Sunday, a two-run shot in the eighth to give the Tampa Bay Rays a 5-3 win over the Boston Red Sox at Tropicana Field.  That felt good,  said Miller, who helped the Rays (47-43) take three of four from the Red Sox (50-39) to pull within 3 1/2 games at the All-Star break.  Obviously a huge series win against a team we're looking up at. That was a lot of fun.  What started as a duel between Tampa Bay's Chris Archer and Boston's David Price saw two lead changes in the final three innings. Dustin Pedroia's two-run shot off Archer in the seventh gave Boston a 3-2 lead, but the Rays clawed back for the win, matching a season-high at four games over .500.  It's huge. Going into the break against the first-place team in our division, and to win a series, three out of four ... shows what we're capable of in the second half,  outfielder Steven Souza Jr. said. Miller's home run came after the Rays had tied the score in the seventh on a sacrifice fly, also against reliever Joe Kelly (3-1), who came in with a 1.04 ERA and a streak of 23 straight scoreless appearances.  Very hard-fought series, with some well-pitched games against us, including today,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said.  Pedie gives us a huge lift with a two-run home run late. ... Unfortunately, they were able to bounce back and put a couple of runs on the board.  Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at RaysBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchBrad Boxberger (1-0) got the win in relief of Rays starter Chris Archer, who dueled with Boston starter David Price. Rays closer Alex Colome pitched a scoreless ninth for his 25th save -- the most in the American League -- and his third in four days. The Rays' scoring in the seventh and eighth both started with leadoff walks --  you're inviting trouble,  Farrell said. Down 3-2 in the seventh, Mallex Smith got a leadoff walk on four pitches against Matt Barnes, advanced on a sacrifice bunt and took third on Souza's single off the glove of third baseman Tzu-Wei Lin. Kelly came in and Corey Dickerson hit a sacrifice fly to left field to score Smith and tie it at 3. Boston had two on in the eighth after a pair of two-out walks, but Boxberger struck out Christian Vazquez to end the inning. Pedroia had gone 161 at-bats without a home run until he had one in Friday's win, and he didn't wait long to do so again. Archer had held the Red Sox to one run and had two outs in the seventh, with a full count on Pedroia, who sent the pitch just over the wall in right field. Price, facing his former team, held the Rays to five hits in six innings.  Tampa played extremely well. They threw the ball well. They played unbelievable defense,  Price said.  They had the big hits when they need them. That's what you need to do to win baseball games.  Mookie Betts led off the game with a solo home run, his 16th homer of the season, off Archer, setting a Red Sox record with the 11th home run of his career leading off a game. The Rays answered in the bottom of the first, with Souza hitting a double off the top of the wall and scoring on an RBI single by Evan Longoria. In the third, Souza walked, advanced on a double by Dickerson and scored on a sacrifice fly by Longoria for a 2-1 lead. That lead held until the seventh when Archer gave up a bloop single to Lin, before the home run to Pedroia. The Rays played spectacular defense behind Archer -- Souza made a diving catch of a foul ball in the Rays' bullpen, and Dickerson made a leaping catch against the wall in left field before throwing to double off the runner at first base. Archer struck out eight batters but came up a pitch short in trying to outduel his close friend and former teammate in Price. NOTES: The All-Star break is much-needed for the Red Sox, who finished a run of 33 games in 34 days. After the break, they'll play 24 games in 24 days, including a doubleheader against the Yankees on July 16. The Rays, by comparison, have had three off days in the last 18 days. They open the second half with 23 games in 24 days. ... Saturday's 1-0 Rays win was the team's first by that score since August 2015, and the first at home since September 2014. The Rays hadn't won a 1-0 game on a sacrifice fly since 2007 when Josh Wilson did so, also against the Red Sox.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-redsox-rays-writethru-idUSMTZED79UBXUS0"},

As her minority government prepares to start the difficult task of passing Brexit through parliament, May will remind Britons of her promise to build a fairer society, seeking to repair a reputation damaged by an ill-judged snap election. Almost one year on from her first day as Prime Minister -- a job she took on in the chaotic aftermath of Britain's shock referendum vote to leave the European Union -- May will urge voters and political opponents to help her  tackle the injustice and vested interests that threaten to hold us back .  My commitment to change in Britain is undimmed,  May will say on Tuesday according to advanced extracts from her speech. May called the unscheduled election on June 8 in an attempt to cash in on high poll ratings and win support for her plan to make a clean break with the EU in 2019. But the gamble backfired when voters stripped her of a majority in parliament and forced her party into a deal with a small Northern Irish party to prop up a minority government.  In this new context, it will be even more important to make the case for our policies and our values, and to win the battle of ideas both in Parliament as well as in the country,  May will say. May's ability to carry on as prime minister and drive divisive Brexit legislation through parliament with only a fragile majority behind her has been persistently questioned since the election. The first stage of the Brexit process will come later this week when a key piece of legislation, which translates EU law into British law, is presented to parliament. On Sunday, a lawmaker from the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, Britain's fourth largest party, said he thought Brexit might not happen because the divisions over how to achieve it were too great. But May's position seems secure for now, with colleagues preferring to see her start Brexit talks rather than topple her and risk the whole government collapsing -- a scenario that could let a resurgent opposition Labour Party into power. Employment Report May will make the appeal for national backing at the launch of a report into how the government should protect workers affected by a shift to different employment models, including the 'gig economy' championed by the likes of Uber and Deliveroo. The report is a key element of May's plan, announced a year ago, to address dissatisfaction expressed at the EU referendum by millions of working class Britons who felt left behind by capitalism and disenchanted with the political system. May was criticised by opponents last month for setting out an unambitious legislative agenda for the next two years, unveiling a programme shorn of flagship social reforms and heavily focused on delivering Brexit. In Tuesday's speech, she will seek to refute the idea that her lack of a majority in parliament and the huge workload generated by Brexit will limit the government's reform ambition.  At this critical time in our history, we can either be timid or we can be bold,  May will say.  We will act with an unshakeable sense of purpose to build the better, fairer Britain which we all want to see.

My view is that it's probably going to be dead,  McCain,  said on the CBS program  Face the Nation,  adding that Republicans, who narrowly control the chamber, would likely need to work with Democrats on a healthcare bill.

Senators return to Washington on Monday. The Senate bill keeps intact much of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature legislation, popularly known as Obamacare, but strips away most of its funding. It repeals most Obamacare taxes, overhauls the law's tax credits and ends its Medicaid expansion. It also goes beyond repealing Obamacare by cutting funding for the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled beginning in 2025. At least 10 Republican senators have opposed the bill in its current form, but many more have criticized the legislation or said they are undecided. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy said on Sunday the draft bill was undergoing a  serious rewrite.   Clearly, the draft plan is dead,  he said on Fox News.  Is the serious rewrite plan dead?

A spokesman for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Senate leadership was continuing to work with Republican senators and the CBO on the legislation, but did not comment on McCain's remarks or the bill's future. Republican Senator Ted Cruz said on Sunday that failure to pass the bill was  not an option  and that the Senate effort must focus on lowering premiums. He pointed to an amendment he offered that is being scored by the CBO. Cruz's amendment would allow insurers to offer plans that do not comply with Obamacare's mandate that they charge sick and healthy people the same rates and cover a set of essential health benefits, such as maternity care and prescription drugs, as long as they also offer plans that do comply with the regulations. Cruz's amendment has drawn support from conservative senators and groups, who say the amendment will help lower premiums. But moderate Republicans and outside critics say it will erode protections for people with pre-existing conditions and make their insurance unaffordable. McConnell has said he plans to hold a vote on the legislation, which needs the support of at least 50 of the Senate's 52 Republicans, before a six-week recess that begins on July 29.

Compared to last year, the world has become more uncertain ... but the market seems quite happy,  GIC's CEO Lim Chow Kiat said in an interview, as the fund published its annual report.  I hope the market is right, but we are cautious.  Smaller Singapore peer Temasek Holdings focuses on equities, but GIC, set up to manage Singapore's foreign reserves, adopts a more conservative investment strategy, with the long-term goal of beating global inflation. GIC is ranked the world's tenth biggest sovereign investor, with about $343 billion worth of assets, according to Sovereign Wealth Centre. On Monday, the fund said its portfolio return was 5.1 percent per annum in U.S. dollar nominal terms over the five years to March 31, 2017, helped by the run-up in global financial assets, versus 3.7 percent a year ago. But that was below the 6 percent return of GIC's reference portfolio of 65 percent global equities and 35 percent bonds.  We are prepared for a period of protracted uncertainty and low returns,  said Lim, 47, who took charge as the CEO in January after a 24-year career at the fund. While market volatility was low by historic standards, helped by accommodative monetary policies, it was out of sync with increased overall uncertainty, the fund said. Current valuations, it added, suggest excessive optimism over future earnings. MSCI's gauge of world equities struck record highs last month.  Two years ago, we said the market would return x over the next 10 years. We would argue half of the x was returned in the first year, year and a half,  said Jeffrey Jaensubhakij, GIC's Chief Investment Officer.  Now there is only half an x over the next eight and a half years.  Taking the Long View In a low-growth, low-yield environment, sovereign wealth funds such as GIC are facing an ever greater challenge to make enough returns to hit internal targets. GIC reported a 20-year annualised real return - its key measurement gauge - of 3.7 percent above global inflation for the year ended March, down from 4 percent a year ago. GIC invests in growth and defensive assets such as emerging and developed market equities, real estate, private equity and inflation-linked bonds and is known to be a patient investor. GIC's cautious comments come days before Temasek is likely to report a rebound in its assets to a record high. With more than 1,400 staff, GIC says it manages  well over  $100 billion of assets, but does not disclose the exact size of its portfolio. It has 34 percent of its assets in the United States, followed by 19 percent in Asia excluding Japan, and 12 percent each in Japan and the Eurozone. Emerging market equities, which accounted for 17 percent of GIC's portfolio, offer opportunities after a few challenging years and subsequent reform, Jaensubhakij said - as opposed to developed markets such as the United States after an election-fuelled rally. GIC rarely comments on individual holdings, but it hit headlines in May when it pared its stake in UBS Group at a loss to 2.7 percent from 5.1 percent. GIC attributed the sale to changes in UBS' strategy and business. GIC, one of the first sovereign funds to invest in Western banks during the global financial crisis, retains the other major investment made at the time, a stake in Citigroup which is profitable at current prices.

Kenyatta had earlier responded to a court victory for the opposition against Kenya's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) by cautioning against any use of the court process to delay the elections.    They are taking us for fools,  he told an election rally in the western county of Baringo, referring to the judiciary.  I want to tell those in courts, we have respected you. But do not think respect is cowardice. And we will not allow our opponents to use the courts and to intimidate the IEBC, thinking they will win using the back door.  Chief Justice David Maraga released a statement a few hours later, saying:  When political leaders cast aspersions on the administration of justice based on a misinterpretation of my statements, it has the potential to impair public confidence in our courts, and this concerns me a great deal.  Memories are still fresh in Kenya of the violent clashes that killed more than 1,200 people following a disputed election in 2007. Some fear a repeat following the Aug. 8 polls in which Kenyatta is seeking a second and final five-year term.   Kenyans are also due to choose legislators and local representatives for the first time since 2013, when the elections passed peacefully after the opposition challenged the results in court.  The opposition has already brought a flurry of cases against the electoral commission, including the one settled on Friday when the high court ruled that contract to print ballot papers for the presidential poll had not been awarded transparently. Kenyatta's chief rival is veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, the head of the National Super Alliance, who was also the opposition candidate in both 2007 and 2013.  A spokesman for Odinga said he had been hospitalized on Sunday with a suspected case of mild food poisoning.

After all he came close to eclipsing his own mark at the 1974 Wimbledon and U.S. Open finals, only to be denied by a brash 22-year-old American upstart called Jimmy Connors. Yet for all the astonishing feats of excellence shown by champions of the caliber of Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi or Connors, that record has been out of reach for 45 years. But according to Bill Norris, the ATP's former Director of Medical Services who spent 35 years patching up the broken and sore bodies of players from Rosewall to Roger Federer, advances in sports science mean it is not inconceivable that a 40-year-old could soon be triumphing at the majors.  I don’t think (a 40-year-old winning a major) is far fetched. It is very possible,  Norris told Reuters in a telephone interview from his home in Boca Raton, Florida.  Ken Rosewall was way into his years when he played in the 74 (Australian and Wimbledon) finals, he was incredible.    With today's players, they have the advantage of sports sciences, we know more about the body than ever before. Players know how to prepare better.  That has certainly proved to be true over the past year. For the first time since Australian great Rod Laver swept the majors in 1969, Wimbledon could become the fourth successive grand slam title to fall into the lap of a player over 30. Stan Wawrinka started the run at last year's U.S. Open, followed by a 35-year-old Federer at Melbourne Park and Rafa Nadal in Paris. Wimbledon marked the first time in the professional era that the top five seeds - Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Wawrinka - at a slam were all over 30. With a record seven over-30s into the second week at Wimbledon, where Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray have been joined by fellow 30-somethings Kevin Anderson, Gilles Muller and Tomas Berdych, it is very possible that the semi-finals could see a complete lockout of players yet to celebrate their 30th birthday.  The players in their 30s are the beneficiaries of good sports science, good conditioning and good nutrition and all the different disciplines that make up what I call tennis medicine,  said the 74-year-old Norris who has been around professional athletes since the age of 12 after being mentored by the medical team of the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team.   We are producing players that are faster, stronger than ever before. They know how to do some balance and they know when to take time off.  Players from this generation, they are more investigative, they are constantly seeking that edge to make them better. And we have tools now that can help them to withstand a lot of different pressures.  Concerns Resurfaced When Nadal withdrew from defending his Wimbledon title in 2009 with tendonitis in his knees, fans feared it could be a career-ending injury. Those concerns resurfaced in 2012 when he pulled out of the Olympics and U.S. Open. A wrist injury also played havoc with the Spaniard's 2016 season as he cut short his French Open campaign before skipping Wimbledon. The 31-year-old's greatest rival, Federer, has also not been immune to health issues after being forced to spend the last six months of 2016 on the sidelines recuperating from a knee injury that had required surgery earlier in the season. Yet the duo defied logic when they contested a five-set thriller in January's Australian Open final, where the Swiss eventually snatched victory to capture a record 18th grand slam trophy. For those who are privy to what goes on behind-the-scenes, such astonishing feats of endurance are not surprising.         Players today are incorporating massive amounts of off-court and injury prevention training in their programmes as compared to training programs in the 80's, 90's and before,  Todd Ellenbecker, the ATP's Vice President of Medical Services, told Reuters.  These programs are meant to not only enhance performance and improve overall fitness and athleticism, but also to decrease injury risk. As such, we are seeing players excelling in age ranges beyond those previously encountered and at a far greater frequency.    Forty three of the top 100 players are 30 years or older, showing that enhanced training and injury prevention programing can have a positive effect on optimal tennis play and longevity.  In an attempt to prolong careers, the ATP World Tour has a framework in place where long-serving players are allowed to decrease the number of mandatory tournaments they compete in without being penalized in the rankings.  In tennis we say there is no off weeks but you really have to get some balance in your life to recover mentally as well as physically,  said Norris.  The players that schedules themselves right, don’t burn themselves out and can have a long and prosperous career.  It is a sentiment shared by former player Brad Gilbert.  It used to be you turned 30, you were on the other side of your career, you were on the downside. Now... age is just a number.   Look at (Cristiano) Ronaldo at 32. The best soccer player in the world. Tom Brady's... going to be 40 soon, he's the best quarterback ever. Roger is almost 36.   Athletes are starting to believe that you can do things longer, you can continue to improve.     Editing by Ed Osmond","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-wimbledon-age-idUSKBN19U0PN"},

Speaking at the opening ceremony of an oil conference in Istanbul, where he received an award recognizing his four decades of work in the industry, Tillerson also said the United States saw Turkey as a partner in its push for greater energy security in the region.  We're all here in Istanbul at a momentous time. Nearly a year ago, the Turkish people - brave men and women - stood up against coup plotters and defended their democracy,  Tillerson said.   I take this moment to recognize their courage and honor the victims of the events of July 15, 2016.  A group of rogue soldiers commandeered tanks, helicopters and warplanes on the night of July 15, attacking parliament and seizing control of roads and bridges in an effort to overthrow the government. The putsch failed when thousands of Turks took to the streets in protest, answering a call from President Tayyip Erdogan to resist the coup. More than 240 people, many of them civilians, died that night. Since the failed coup more than 100,000 people have been sacked or suspended from their work in the civil service, police, military and private sector and some 40,000 people jailed. The government says such efforts are needed, given the scope of the security threat it faces. Rights groups and some Western governments say that Turkey is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent, and on Sunday hundreds of thousands of people attended an opposition rally in Istanbul. Tillerson, who was previously the head of Exxon Mobil Corp, arrived in Turkey on Sunday evening and was due to meet Erdogan later on Sunday, according to Erdogan's office. Ankara had high hopes for the administration of President Donald Trump, after relations with Washington soured under former President Barack Obama. However, Erdogan has been angered by Trump's decision to arm a Syrian Kurdish militia in the fight against Islamic State in northern Syria. Turkey sees the Kurdish fighters as a terrorist group and worries their advance in Syria would inflame a Kurdish insurgency at home.

Islamic State's defeat in Mosul three years after taking the city is a major blow for the hardline Sunni Islamist group, which is also losing ground in its operational base in the Syrian city of Raqqa from where it has planned global attacks. The group, however, still controls territory in Iraq and is expected to revert to more conventional insurgent tactics such as bombings as its self-proclaimed caliphate falls apart. The battle for Mosul - by far the largest city to fall under the militants' control - has left large areas in ruins, killed thousands of civilians and displaced nearly 1 million people.  The commander in chief of the armed forces (Prime Minister) Haider al-Abadi arrived in the liberated city of Mosul and congratulated the heroic fighters and Iraqi people for the great victory,  his office said in a statement. State television later showed Abadi touring Mosul on foot alongside residents of Iraq's second-largest city.  Air strikes and exchanges of gunfire could still be heard in the narrow streets of Mosul's Old City, where the group has staged its last stand against Iraqi forces backed by a U.S.-led international coalition. Abadi met commanders in west Mosul who led the battle, but he has yet to issue a formal declaration that the entire city has been retaken from the group which is also known as ISIS. Abadi's spokesman, Saad al-Hadithi, said victory would not be formally declared until the few remaining Islamic State militants were cleared from Mosul. Still, France and Britain, members of the coalition that has conducted air strikes and provided training and assistance to Iraqi forces on the battlefield, welcomed the defeat.  Mosul liberated from ISIS: France pays homage to all those, who alongside our troops, contributed to this victory,  French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted.  I congratulate Prime Minister Abadi, and the Iraqi forces who have been fighting on the ground with great bravery and care against a brutal opponent,  British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said in a statement. While celebrating  the removal of the death cult from Mosul , Fallon said the military operation was not over. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is pictured in Mosul, Iraq July 9, 2017.Stringer This barbaric group remains dug in west of the Euphrates and clearing operations in and around Mosul will be needed because of the threat from improvised explosive devices.      In Washington, National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton, when asked whether the battle for Mosul was complete, replied:  Situation not resolved, but we are monitoring.   Fight to the Death      Iraq still faces uncertainty and long-term stability will be possible only if the government contains ethnic and sectarian tensions which have dogged the country since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. The fall of Mosul exposes fractures between Arabs and Kurds over disputed territories, and between Sunnis and the Shi’ite majority.        Slideshow (20 Images)The group vowed to  fight to the death  in Mosul, but Iraqi military spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Rasool told state TV that 30 militants had been killed attempting to flee by swimming across the River Tigris that bisects the city.     Cornered in a shrinking area, the militants resorted to sending women suicide bombers among the thousands of civilians who are emerging from the battlefield wounded, malnourished and fearful, Iraqi army officers said. The struggle has also exacted a heavy toll on Iraq's security forces.  The Iraqi government does not reveal casualty figures, but a funding request from the U.S. Department of Defense said the elite Counter Terrorism Service (CTS), which has spearheaded the fight in Mosul, had suffered 40 percent losses.         The Department of Defense has requested $1.269 billion in U.S. budget funds for 2018 to continue supporting Iraqi forces, which collapsed in the face of the few hundred militants who overran Mosul in 2014. Backed by coalition air strikes, an array of Iraqi forces gradually clawed back territory from Islamic State until reaching Mosul, the group's de facto capital in Iraq, last October.     It is almost exactly three years since the ultra-hardline group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, proclaimed a  caliphate  spanning Syria and Iraq from the pulpit of Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque.     Abadi declared the end of Islamic State's  state of falsehood  a week ago, after security forces retook the mosque - although only after retreating militants blew it up.     The United Nations predicts it will cost more than $1 billion to repair basic infrastructure in Mosul. In some of the worst affected areas, almost no buildings appear to have escaped damage and Mosul's dense construction means the extent of the devastation might be underestimated, U.N. officials said.

There will be other great battles to fight in the Pyrenees and the Alps,  Bardet said after taking fourth place. Uran also had a mechanical and was forced to ride the final kilometers on a single gear.  The difference between Rigo and the other riders I know is that he never loses his cool,  his Cannondale-Drapac team manager Jonathan Vaughters told reporters.

Uran is fourth, 55 seconds off the pace while Astana look set to work as a double act from now on as Dane Fuglsang is fifth, 1:37 behind Froome. Three-times podium finisher Nairo Quintana of Colombia also struggled, losing 1:15 to Froome and his group. He is now eighth overall, a massive 2:13 off the pace. Monday is a rest day and the fight for the overall title is set to resume next Thursday with the first big Pyrenean stage. In-form Porte, however, will not be contesting it after a high-speed crash ruined his chances, with the Australian taking down Ireland's Dan Martin with him. Quick-Step Floors' Martin got back on his bike but crashed again before limiting the damage on the line. He is now sixth overall, 1:44 behind Froome. French champion Arnaud Demare, who was targeting the green jersey for the points classification, missed the time cut, as well as the three FDJ team mates who were helping him, meaning the four are now out of the race. Slovakian Juraj Sagan, Italian Matteo Trentin and Australian Mark Renshaw also finished outside the time limit.

The Italian champion, who had unsettled defending champion Froome when he won the fifth stage at the top of La Planche des Belles Filles, powered past Froome just as the Briton raised his right arm to require assistance. He was followed by most of Froome's rivals, but none of them took turns in front of the group that had taken shape, with Richie Porte, who later abandoned when he crashed in the descent, appearing to talk him down. There is no rule against attacking a rider who is suffering a mechanical problem but it can be considered unsporting.

I didn't see it at the time that he had a mechanical problem. I wanted to attack right in that moment -- 6km from the summit.  Froome managed to come back to the group with the help of his team mates, and appeared to elbow Aru, but the Italian played the incident down.  I was about to fall there. You can even ask him. I was about fall because I touched a fan. He apologized right away. It certainly wasn't voluntary,  said Aru. Froome was also diplomatic, saying he did not see Aru was attacking.

Astana rider Aru powered away from the yellow jersey group with 6km left on the last climb of the day to the Mont du Chat just when Froome needed help from his team car. A gentleman's agreement states that riders do not attack their rivals if they are down, with some believing it should extend to cases when one of them suffers a mechanical. Briton Froome said he had a mechanical and he changed bike, but none of his other rivals capitalized on the incident as they just stayed on Aru's wheel, with Richie Porte even appearing to talk the Italian down.  I think he was preparing to attack. You can't just stop racing because somebody raises his arm. You're 5km from the top of the climb you don't stop racing,  LeMond, who is on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, said in a daily chat with Reuters.  I just don't think he did it intentionally, he was probably ready to attack. What I didn't understand is that everyone else followed and then stopped,  the American added. Porte crashed on the final descent, taking Ireland's Dan Martin down with him, but nobody waited for them.  If anybody should have stopped it was when Porte crashed. Dan Martin went back up, they could have waited for him,  said LeMond, who won the Tour in 1986, 1989 and 1990.

You can't stop the whole race because he raises his arm. How do you know, it could have been that he just wanted water,  he said.  And his bike was perfectly ridable at the moment. It was just the gears being stuck apparently. What are you going to do? Stop the race because Froome puts his arm up?  LeMond believes that his rivals could wait for him, but not at a critical point of the stage.     You can do that if you're 50, 60km from the finish and nothing is happening,  he said.  In 1990, I flatted with one km to go, nobody waited on me, they went balls to the wall,  LeMond recalled. The American was also very critical of Froome as he witnessed the three-times champion fiddling with his on-board computer on his new bike before making it back to the front group.  It's so bizarre to see him change his bike and then touch his computer. The main point is 'get on your bike, get back to the front',  said LeMond.  Something I just don't understand.

Eager to keep Frankfurt from getting the bulk of jobs that leave London, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe outlined on Friday plans to ease the financial sector's wage bills and vowed to keep the regulatory burden competitive. Executives at a business conference in southern France this weekend said the election in May of former investment banker Emmanuel Macron had brought a night-and-day change in attitude towards their industry.  The government clearly wants to make France finance-friendly,  UBS France head Jean Frederic de Leusse said, noting the contrast with Macron's predecessor Francois Hollande, who famously once declared the finance industry to be his enemy. Philippe announced the scrapping of the highest bracket of payroll tax for firms like banks that do not pay VAT, and canceled a planned extension of tax on share trading, both measures unthinkable under Hollande. The new policy will also ensure bankers' bonuses are no longer taken into account when labor courts decide unfair dismissal compensation.  Deutsche Asset Management head, Nicolas Moreau, said that while Philippe's package of measures was a step in the right direction, Paris had a lot of catching up to do in the race with other cities trying to win jobs from London.

Former Bank of France governor Christian Noyer, tasked by the government to lobby foreign finance firms to come to Paris, said that even when banks say they are seeking a banking license in Frankfurt that does not mean most of the jobs will be there.

There are days when I think he's a bit of a laggard, but we'll see. I am going to talk to him today, we'll see what happens.  Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion with Ferrari and now 37 years old, is out of contract at the end of the season and has not won a race since he was with Lotus in 2013. While four times champion team mate Sebastian Vettel, also out of contract at the end of the year, has won three of eight races and leads the championship by 20 points from Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton, the Finn is fifth overall. Raikkonen's best result of the season so far was second in Monaco in May and he finished fifth on Sunday after starting from third place. Vettel was second behind Mercedes' winner Valtteri Bottas in Austria. Vettel, with 171 points, has scored more than twice as many as Raikkonen (83).  Obviously I want to do well,  the Finn told Reuters after the race.  I can only do the best that I can. It's not like I'm not trying. Unfortunately, it's not been very straightforward sometimes but that's part of F1.  We keep pushing and I'm sure things will get better.    Very Satisfied Marchionne said he was very satisfied with the team's performance, after a dismal 2016 season in which they failed to win a race, and also with Vettel despite the German's recent 'road rage' controversy with Britain's Hamilton.

I am happy with what Sebastian is doing, just in case anybody is wondering.  Vettel was handed a 10 seconds stop-and-go penalty during the race in Azerbaijan last month for deliberately banging wheels with Hamilton while they were behind the safety car. The German was then summoned to a hearing at the sport's governing FIA (International Automobile Federation) in Paris last Monday, which decided to take no further action after Vettel apologized and accepted full responsibility. FIA president Jean Todt said on Saturday that the Ferrari driver would face  very severe consequences  if there were any further such incidents.

The IOC has been working towards setting up the ITA as an independent testing body to take over testing for the IOC and international federations.  We will assist it but (testing) in Pyeongchang will be under the authority of the ITA,  IOC medical chief Richard Budgett told reporters.  It will be there in Pyeongchang, even if in a preliminary form.   Responsibility will be passed to the ITA. The resources of the IOC will be there at their disposal,  he said. Until the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, the IOC was responsible for doping tests during the Olympics.  Budgett said the ITA would not be in a position to take over testing from an international federation by February next year, but it would be able to operate in Pyeongchang and would decide who to test, when and for what substances. The IOC is desperate to boost the fight against doping with Russian track and field athletes banned from last year's Rio de Janeiro Olympics due to a widespread state-backed doping system that involved many sports in the country. More than 100 positive cases have also emerged in re-testing samples from the Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Olympics, while the IOC is also re-testing samples from the Sochi 2014 winter Games in Russia and the 2010 Vancouver winter Olympics. Budgett said the IOC would be financially supporting the ITA for the first few years but was confident the new organization would be able to operate independently after that by charging international federations for their services.

The clashes broke out when an armed group opposed to the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli tried to approach the capital and were confronted by forces that have aligned themselves with the GNA, the witness said. The fighting exposes the GNA's vulnerability to militias that gained influence during and after Libya's 2011 uprising. The anti-GNA forces, which are aligned with a previous, self-declared government, were driven from Tripoli late in May and have been trying to regroup. The GNA recently issued a warning about a counter-attack on the capital. Since the GNA arrived in Tripoli last year it has co-opted some of the many armed groups that had a presence in the capital. But it has made little progress integrating them and the security situation has remained highly volatile. Groups aligned with the self-declared national salvation government and largely drawing on support from the western city of Misrata have battled to hold their ground.  The two sides clashed on Sunday near the coastal town of Garabulli, about 50 km (30 miles) east of Tripoli.  The ground is shaking under my feet,  said a resident who asked not to be named.  The noise from the clashes is so loud that I think the groups fighting are using heavy artillery.  GNA-aligned brigades closed the coastal road in Tajoura, an eastern suburb of Tripoli, and built sand barriers to try to block their rivals' advance. Local authorities were advising residents to evacuate and stay away from the area. The U.N. mission to Libya urged both sides to refrain from further escalation.

The report cites research from Citigroup senior energy analyst Eric Lee, who previously called for a bear market in oil when the price was above $100. The decline in recent weeks to a low of just over $44 for Brent crude LCOc1, the international benchmark, has made Lee a short-term bull, Barron's notes. Lee projects demand of 97.3 million barrels a day in 2017, a record high, up from 96 million in 2016, driven largely by emerging market countries such as China and India. Simultaneously, reduction in supply from OPEC of about 0.7 million barrels a day versus the 2016 average should drive the price up before the end of the fourth quarter. A decline in global oil inventories began after the first quarter, and Lee projects that it will continue at an accelerated rate through the end of this year. Oil prices settled nearly 3 percent lower on Friday as  rising U.S. production and an increase in OPEC exports to a 2017 high cast doubt on efforts by producers to curb a persistent glut. [O/R] On Friday Reuters data showed that OPEC production is now at the highest level of the year. Matt Smith, director of commodity research at Clipperdata, said OPEC exports were 2 million barrels per day (bpd) higher last month than in June 2016, despite the extension of OPEC's 1.8 million bpd production cut. Lee notes that oil speculators ignored details of OPEC's agreement, which ordered cuts to begin at the end of 2016 rather than when the accord was announced. That allowed participants to ramp up production during negotiations, which meant the cuts were struck from a higher base. As for supply from the United States, Lee says continued pumping by producers will keep prices from skyrocketing back towards $100 a barrel, but their presence is unlikely to prevent an upward move in oil for the remainder of the year. Following the jump to $60 Lee expects prices to remain flat heading into 2018, as the supply side catches up with demand. Barring major political disruptions from petroleum-producing nations, he expects the price of crude probably will not rise much above $60.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of an oil conference in Istanbul, where he received an award recognizing his four decades of work in the industry, Tillerson also said the United States saw Turkey as a partner in its push for greater energy security in the region.  We're all here in Istanbul at a momentous time. Nearly a year ago, the Turkish people - brave men and women - stood up against coup plotters and defended their democracy,  Tillerson said.   I take this moment to recognize their courage and honor the victims of the events of July 15, 2016.  A group of rogue soldiers commandeered tanks, helicopters and warplanes on the night of July 15, attacking parliament and seizing control of roads and bridges in an effort to overthrow the government. The putsch failed when thousands of Turks took to the streets in protest, answering a call from President Tayyip Erdogan to resist the coup. More than 240 people, many of them civilians, died that night. Since the failed coup more than 100,000 people have been sacked or suspended from their work in the civil service, police, military and private sector and some 40,000 people jailed. The government says such efforts are needed, given the scope of the security threat it faces. Rights groups and some Western governments say that Turkey is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent, and on Sunday hundreds of thousands of people attended an opposition rally in Istanbul. Tillerson, who was previously the head of Exxon Mobil Corp, arrived in Turkey on Sunday evening and was due to meet Erdogan later on Sunday, according to Erdogan's office. Ankara had high hopes for the administration of President Donald Trump, after relations with Washington soured under former President Barack Obama. However, Erdogan has been angered by Trump's decision to arm a Syrian Kurdish militia in the fight against Islamic State in northern Syria. Turkey sees the Kurdish fighters as a terrorist group and worries their advance in Syria would inflame a Kurdish insurgency at home.

As of Sunday morning, the latest cinematic depiction of the webbed-hero,  Spider-Man: Homecoming,  is looking at a $117 million opening from 4,348 locations. $10.6 million of the domestic total came from 392 Imax screens. That's a huge win for Sony, Columbia Pictures, and Marvel Studios for the film, which cost roughly $175 million to produce. The anticipated opening weekend is higher than industry estimates, which were in the $90 million to $110 million range, while the studio cautiously pegged it at $80 million.  Everyone at Sony and Marvel are thrilled,  said Josh Greenstein, Sony's marketing chief.  It's safe to say it's a triumphant return for Spider-Man.   Homecoming  banked on the idea that the summer box office was craving a family-friendly superhero movie -- Tom Holland plays a high school version of Peter Parker who, at 15 years old, has to prove that he is worthy of being called an Avenger. And it seems that bet is paying off. The $117 million figure is the second largest in Sony Pictures history, behind  Spider-Man 3.  Much attention has been paid to the flick's successful marketing campaign, which heavily featured Iron Man (Robert Downy Jr.), who serves as Spider-Man's mentor in the film. Michael Keaton plays the big bad, Vulture, Jon Favreau plays Spidey's guardian, Happy Hogan, and Zendaya stars as Michelle Jones ( MJ ), Parker's brainy classmate.

While the former has proven essentially infallible in the biz,  Homecoming  serves as a redemption narrative for the latter. After the infamous 2014 Sony hack, Pascal was ousted from her post at the top of the studio, and began to focus on producing. This is her second major release following last summer's  Ghostbusters  reboot, but she also has a hand in a long list of upcoming projects including Sony's  Barbie  movie, Steven Spielberg's A-list-studded  The Papers,  and future  Spider-Man  movies. The World Premiere of “Spider-Man: Homecoming”  – Arrivals – Los Angeles, California, U.S., 28/06/2017 - Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee.Mario Anzuoni We have incredible partners,  said Greenstein, who said that those relationships helped the film to be  embraced in a big way. It really shows the strength for this beloved character.  Despite the reliability of superhero movies at the box office,  Homecoming  could have been seen as a big bet for all parties involved. For one, it's the third iteration of the character in the past 15 years -- before Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire donned the Spidey suit. The makers had to trust that audiences would be ready to see the character yet again. On top of that, the summer box office has not been particularly kind to the sequels and reboots that have become the industry's summer signature. As audience fatigue has impacted previously reliable franchises like  Transformers  and even  Despicable Me,  the one thing that this summer has proved is that the domestic audience is not yet burnt out on superheroes. This is yet another Marvel movie release that has managed to capture the approval of critics and audience members -- something the  DC Extended Universe could not claim until this summer with  Wonder Woman.  But Marvel's been there since the beginning.  Homecoming  currently has a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes and an A CinemaScore.  Homecoming  is the only major release this weekend, so the rest of the top five are made up to familiar faces. Starting with  Despicable Me 3,  which is headed for a $34 million second frame, or a 53% drop from last weekend.  Baby Driver  should sit comfortable in third, as positive word of a mouth is steering to a $12.8 million second weekend, or a 38% drop.  Wonder Woman  continues to hold on with $10.1 million in its sixth weekend, and  Transformers: The Last Knight  should round out the top five with $6.3 million. Kumail Nanjiani's  The Big Sick  is entering the top ten as it expands toward wide release, starting next Friday. From 326 North American theaters this weekend the movie should make $3.7 million. Sofia Coppola's  The Beguiled  should stay in the top ten as it, too, expands. This weekend it's expected to make $2.1 million from 941 locations. Meanwhile, A24's  A Ghost Story  starring Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck should spook $105,000 from four locations during its opening frame. Overall, the summer box office stands at about $2.3 billion, or 8% lower than last year. That leaves the year overall about dead even with 2016 after movies like  Beauty and the Beast,   Logan,   Get Out  and  The Fate of the Furious  laid a strong foundation for the summer during the early part of the calendar year.  Despite the strength of 'Spider-Man: Homecoming,' yet another 'down' weekend puts us dead even with last year's box office pace as we remain down 8% for the summer,  said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at ComScore.  The silver lining is the expected continued strength of Spidey, plus 'War For The Planet of The Apes,' 'Dunkirk,' and 'Atomic Blonde' all in rapid succession that could fuel a much-needed late summer renaissance at the multiplex.

Wonder Woman  continues to hold on with $10.1 million in its sixth weekend, and  Transformers: The Last Knight  should round out the top five with $6.3 million. Kumail Nanjiani's  The Big Sick  is entering the top ten as it expands toward wide release, starting next Friday. From 326 North American theaters this weekend the movie should make $3.7 million. Sofia Coppola's  The Beguiled  should stay in the top ten as it, too, expands. This weekend it's expected to make $2.1 million from 941 locations. Meanwhile, A24's  A Ghost Story  starring Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck should spook $105,000 from four locations during its opening frame. Overall, the summer box office stands at about $2.3 billion, or 8% lower than last year. That leaves the year overall about dead even with 2016 after movies like  Beauty and the Beast,   Logan,   Get Out  and  The Fate of the Furious  laid a strong foundation for the summer during the early part of the calendar year.  Despite the strength of 'Spider-Man: Homecoming,' yet another 'down' weekend puts us dead even with last year's box office pace as we remain down 8% for the summer,  said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at ComScore.  The silver lining is the expected continued strength of Spidey, plus 'War For The Planet of The Apes,' 'Dunkirk,' and 'Atomic Blonde' all in rapid succession that could fuel a much-needed late summer renaissance at the multiplex.

The IOC has been working towards setting up the ITA as an independent testing body to take over testing for the IOC and international federations.  We will assist it but (testing) in Pyeongchang will be under the authority of the ITA,  IOC medical chief Richard Budgett told reporters.  It will be there in Pyeongchang, even if in a preliminary form.   Responsibility will be passed to the ITA. The resources of the IOC will be there at their disposal,  he said. Until the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, the IOC was responsible for doping tests during the Olympics.  Budgett said the ITA would not be in a position to take over testing from an international federation by February next year, but it would be able to operate in Pyeongchang and would decide who to test, when and for what substances. The IOC is desperate to boost the fight against doping with Russian track and field athletes banned from last year's Rio de Janeiro Olympics due to a widespread state-backed doping system that involved many sports in the country. More than 100 positive cases have also emerged in re-testing samples from the Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Olympics, while the IOC is also re-testing samples from the Sochi 2014 winter Games in Russia and the 2010 Vancouver winter Olympics. Budgett said the IOC would be financially supporting the ITA for the first few years but was confident the new organization would be able to operate independently after that by charging international federations for their services.

The 22-year-old Spaniard, who hit two eagles and five birdies in a final-round 65 to finish on 24 under par, was at his scintillating best when the incident at the sixth hole threatened to leave him with a two-shot penalty. As he reached the green, Rahm placed his marker to the side of his ball to allow his playing partner Daniel Im to putt from further back. However, on returning to his marker, Rahm replaced his ball to the front, putting him apparently in violation of the rules. TV cameras picked up the incident and Irish media said organizers received emails from viewers alerting them to the possible transgression. However, rules official Andy McPhee  told Sky Sports that no penalty was imposed because Rahm  made a reasonable judgment  in replacing his ball. Key to that decision may have been the fact that Rahm had moved his mark a putter's length to the side to get out of Im's line, allowing for differing interpretations of the rules.   To my eyes, I put the ball back exactly where it was,  Rahm said. Earlier this year, American Lexi Thompson was retrospectively handed a four-stroke penalty for a similar incident at the ANA Inspiration in California, a penalty that cost her what would have been her second major title.

On Sunday Rahm was officially cleared of wrongdoing by chief referee McPhee when he reached the 13th, responding with a 30 foot putt for an eagle.

Investors were told about VW's systematic emissions test cheating using illegal software on Sept. 18 2015, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) informed markets. The Sunday newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported that Oliver Schmidt, a VW executive who was arrested in Miami in January this year, told the then CEO Martin Winterkorn about possible financial implications at an Aug. 25, 2015 presentation.  German securities law requires firms publish any market sensitive news in a timely fashion. A probe by German prosecutors includes investigating whether VW disclosed details promptly. The newspaper said Schmidt informed Winterkorn about the maximum possible penalty at the meeting that was also attended by Heinz-Jakob Neusser, VW's development chief at the time, and Herbert Diess, who still works as VW's brand chief. Bild am Sonntag cited U.S. investigation documents. A VW spokesman said the firm would not comment on the report because of ongoing legal and regulatory investigations. It has previously said it did not violate disclosure rules. The VW spokesman also said Diess had no comment. Lawyers for Winterkorn, who stepped down as VW CEO in September 2015, could not immediately be reached for comment. Annette Voges, the lawyer for Neusser who also left his position in September 2015, declined to comment on behalf of her client saying she had not seen the statements by Schmidt. A lawyer for Schmidt declined to comment.      VW admitted using a  defeat device , the name used to describe software to deceive regulators about the real extent of diesel pollution, to the U.S. EPA and California's Air Resources Board on Sept. 3 2015, according to VW's annual report for 2016. In the annual report, VW said its management did not make details of the scandal public before Sept. 18, 2015 because board members considered costs would be  controllable overall with a view to the business activities of Volkswagen Group.  German prosecutors are investigating Diess, Winterkorn and VW's current chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, as part of a wider probe into market manipulation. The executives have denied wrongdoing. German prosecutors conducting the investigation into market manipulation declined to comment on Sunday. Bild am Sonntag also reported that Winterkorn and Diess were informed VW had used a  defeat device  at a meeting on July 27, 2015. Diess had joined VW just weeks earlier.

Two batters later, Kurt Suzuki had an RBI single and later in the inning Julio Teheran had a two-run single to make it 6-0. Strasburg allowed four runs (one earned) in the third and was lifted for a pinch hitter in the last of the third. Washington manager Dusty Baker said Strasburg was taken out mostly since he was hit by the liner.  Mainly because he was hurting,  Baker said. Strasburg said,  I feel fine. I definitely could've kept going, but I just got singled to death.  He said the hip won't affect his All-Star status. RHP Tanner Roark took over in the fourth inning Saturday against the Atlanta Braves for starter Stephen Strasburg, who was struck on the hip by a comebacker.

Upcoming earnings reports for the technology sector , whose profits are expected to outpace the overall S&P; 500 for the 11th consecutive quarter, could lure back investors who have been concerned about expensive valuations and that too many people may have piled into the big names. The sector has slumped 4 percent since the first week of June, while financials have climbed more than 5 percent and healthcare has gained 3 percent. This has prompted speculation that investors may have been cashing out their tech profits to move into those groups.  Technology has taken a rest, but it’s going to heat up again, and I see tech returning to favor the second half of the year,  said portfolio manager J. Bryant Evans of Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois. For the first five months of 2017, tech was the talk of the stock market, far outperforming the other 10 major S&P; 500 sectors and sparking the Nasdaq Composite to its strongest first half since 2009.  I think of (tech's recent swoon) as profit-taking rather than driven by change in the fundamental factors,  said John Praveen, managing director of Prudential International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey.  The fundamentals are still positive for the sector.  On Friday, the tech sector ended a volatile week by rising 1.3 percent, topping all other sectors and a 0.6 percent rise for the S&P; 500. Analysts estimate tech's second-quarter earnings rose 11.2 percent, with semiconductor companies accounting for much of the gain, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The increase tops the estimated 7.9 percent rise for the overall S&P; 500 and is well above every sector except for energy, whose performance will be skewed because of negative year-earlier results.  The tech sector has the highest growth expectations and only moderate uncertainty,  Morgan Stanley equity strategists said in a research note. Given tech's outsized position - 22 percent of the market value of the S&P; 500 - the sector's growth is critical to overall U.S. corporate profit gains. For the second quarter, tech profit growth alone is expected to account for nearly 28 percent of the S&P; 500's overall increase in earnings, or nearly half if energy were excluded.  In an economy that still seems to have some growing pains, consistent growth is worth paying up for,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. Tech's second-quarter revenue growth is projected at 7.2 percent, faster than 4.6 percent for S&P; 500 companies overall, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. There is  growth on the top line, which is more important at this point in the cycle, than in the bottom line only,  said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. This earnings season, she will focus on companies' comments about sales activity. Valuations for the sector also may not be so expensive. Tech is trading at 18.1 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, just above 17.8 times for the overall market. That difference is even smaller when compared with the premium tech has held over the past 15 years, following the dot-com bubble. Over that time, its average P/E has been 17.2 times versus 14.7 times for the S&P; 500. Another factor in tech's favor: The dollar's 6.1 percent decline this year against a basket of major currencies. S&P; 500 tech companies generate 60 percent of revenue from outside the United States, compared with 40 percent for companies in the entire index. A stronger dollar makes foreign sales less valuable when they are translated back into the U.S. currency for reporting purposes. Despite these positive factors, other sectors may end up besting tech. Healthcare's year-to-date performance has nearly kept pace, and a resolution of the legislation moving through Congress could draw investors who have been wary about political uncertainty hovering over the sector. A pickup in the economy and inflation could favor groups like industrials, energy and financials, which tend to perform better in such times. Clues will come starting on July 14, when a big batch of bank reports kicks off the heart of the earnings season. In tech, Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines Corp report the following week, while Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc and Intel Corp are among the companies that will follow later in the month.

Tillerson said Washington's primary goal was the restoration of Ukrainian territorial sovereignty, in comments that will cheer Kiev and show ties are warmer than many in Ukraine dared hope after U.S. President Donald Trump took office. Ukraine has counted on U.S. support against Russia since a pro-Western government took power following street protests in 2014 that ousted a Kremlin-backed president. But some of Trump's comments during the election campaign last year, from appearing to recognize Crimea as part of Russia to contemplating an end to U.S. sanctions, stoked fears in Kiev that Trump would mend ties with Moscow at Ukraine's expense. Such fears appear to have eased, for the moment.  Trump has not cut a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin behind Ukraine's back over the future of Crimea and Donbass, nor have sanctions on Russia been lifted.  I've been very clear in my discussions with Russian leadership, on more than one occasion, that it is necessary for Russia to take the first steps to de-escalate the situation in the east part of Ukraine, in particular by respecting the ceasefire,  Tillerson said.  Relations between Ukraine and Russia went into freefall after Moscow's annexation of Crimea and the subsequent outbreak of a pro-Russian insurgency in the eastern Donbass region that has killed more than 10,000 people.   We're extremely satisfied with the level of cooperation with our American partners,  Poroshenko said during Sunday's talks with Tillerson.  Speaking to reporters later, Poroshenko said:  In today's visit we see a powerful signal of U.S. support in our common fight for democratic values, for freedom and democracy.  No Big Reset  A Group of 20 summit in Hamburg on Friday and Saturday was a qualified success for Russia. Putin had his first face-to-face encounter with Trump and avoided confrontation with other leaders about his country's conduct. Putin said the meeting laid the groundwork for some improvement in U.S.-Russian ties. But the summit did not produce progress on the issue that vexes Russia most: there is no sign that Trump wants to, or even could, lift U.S. sanctions that are hurting the Russian economy.  I think overall things are in a better place for Ukraine vis-à-vis the U.S.,  said Fabrice Pothier, senior associate at Rasmussen Global, a consultancy founded by the former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who advises Poroshenko.  That's compared to six months ago  when there was a clear state of flux on whether Trump wanted to go for an early, big reset with Putin,  Pothier said.  Instead, Poroshenko met Trump in June before Putin did, and, according to the Ukrainian side, was able to convey effectively Ukraine's plight in their 35-minute talk.   Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attend a meeting in Kiev, Ukraine July 9, 2017.Mykola Lazarenko/PoolUkraine also flaunted two defense agreements it expects to be signed in the coming months and welcomed as a friendly face the Trump administration's appointment of Kurt Volker as a special representative to the Minsk peace process.  A career diplomat, Volker is a former aide to Republican Senator John McCain, a Russia hawk who wants the United States to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine, a move the previous  administration under Barack Obama shied away from. Calm Nerves   People in general felt very frustrated, very nervous about that (Trump's candidacy) and what could happen,  Olexiy Haran, a political science professor at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, said.  The election of a Republican-controlled Congress, in which senior members from both parties advocate greater support for Ukraine against Russia, helped calm nerves, he said. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko gestures as he delivers a joint statement with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Kiev, Ukraine July 9, 2017.Valentyn Ogirenko Personal relations were established,  Haran said of Poroshenko's June 20 meeting with Trump.  This means that Ukraine is not isolated.  At the same time, the United States has imposed new sanctions on Russia, depriving Putin and the Russian economy of an investment boost ahead of the presidential election in March 2018, timed to coincide with the anniversary of the Crimea takeover. Investigations into alleged Russian interference in the election that got Trump into power will also make it harder for Trump to give Putin concessions, even if he wants to.  Ahead of the G20 summit, Trump called on Russia to stop destabilizing Ukraine, a charge that chimes with Kiev's view of the conflict but one that Moscow rejects.   Trump boxed himself into a corner on Russia,  Pothier said.   Even if he really wanted to do a reset, he just, because of all the actions he took, all the statements he made during the campaign and since he has been elected president, has greatly constrained his room for maneuver with Russia.  Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul summed up the jitters many in Kiev felt in November when he predicted Ukraine would be the  biggest loser  from a Trump victory. A senior Western diplomat said the precise direction of Trump's policy on Ukraine remained uncertain because of the president's lack of constancy and a lack of clarity about Volker's role.    The Ukrainians are in a situation much like many other countries where they feel there's a thought through American policy .. but they are still wondering what will happen,  he said, on condition of anonymity. The Ukrainians will also want reassurance that what Tillerson called the  positive chemistry  between Trump and Putin does not bode ill for Kiev. On Sunday, Trump on Twitter hailed a U.S.-Russian brokered ceasefire that came into effect in parts of Syria, saying:  Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!

Bild am Sonntag cited U.S. investigation documents. A VW spokesman said the firm would not comment on the report because of ongoing legal and regulatory investigations.

In the annual report, VW said its management did not make details of the scandal public before Sept. 18, 2015 because board members considered costs would be  controllable overall with a view to the business activities of Volkswagen Group.

After three months of often violent street demonstrations demanding early elections and freedom for activists, the pro-government Supreme Court let Venezuela's most famous jailed politician return to his Caracas home after three years. Lopez, 46, a U.S.-educated economist and leader of the Popular Will party, is beloved by some in the opposition who admire his hardline stance and see him as a future president. But he is loathed by many in the ruling Socialist Party who deem him an elitist coup-monger intent on overthrowing them. The government has framed the release, partly brokered by former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, as evidence that dialogue, not conflict, is the way forward. Maduro quickly urged Lopez to rein in protests he says are seeking a coup amid a blistering economic crisis. But the decision could be an unhappy middle ground that further isolates Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader narrowly elected to replace late leader Hugo Chavez in 2013, without bringing him tangible benefits.  Greeting the decision with fireworks and tears of joy at Lopez's home, opposition supporters vowed to stick to the streets until all their demands are met.  This is like a burst of oxygen after so many years of fighting,  said student Angel Ybirma, 28, who called his mother when he heard the news before draping himself in a Venezuelan flag and hopping on a motorbike to celebrate at the Lopez home.  This shows the government is scared, that it's under a lot of international pressure, and that we're going to emerge from this soon. We have to keep going with more passion,  he said, adding that Lopez deserves full freedom. Lopez, jailed on charges of inciting violence during similar protests in 2014, himself urged Venezuelans to keep up the grueling and often violent street action that has led to nearly 100 deaths, hundreds of arrests, and thousands of injuries. The opposition is also holding an unofficial plebiscite next Sunday to ask Venezuelans what they think of Maduro's controversial plan to rewrite the constitution and whether they instead want an early vote to remove him. Also cheered by some signs of dissent within government and the armed forces, Maduro's foes are unlikely to soon sit down for public talks with the government. A dialogue mediated by Zapatero last year collapsed with little to show for it, and many in the opposition see him as a sellout who bought Maduro more time. Venezuela's opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, who has been granted house arrest after more than three years in jail, salutes supporters, in Caracas, Venezuela July 8, 2017.Andres Martinez CasaresStill, the Lopez decision and the revived role of international mediators could carve out a potential roadmap for future negotiations. Some 'Chavistas' Unhappy The concession to Lopez, the scion of a wealthy family, could also deepen some fissures within  Chavismo , previously united under the charismatic and domineering Chavez. For years, officials have derided Lopez as a murderer and instigator of violence responsible for dozens of deaths during the 2014 protests, so his sudden release for alleged health reasons is sitting badly with some  Chavistas.   Today we awoke to a decision that fills us with indignation,  said former Prisons Minister and prominent Socialist Party official Iris Varela, clad in a T-shirt emblazoned with a stylized image of Chavez's eyes. Slideshow (3 Images)She added that the decision highlights separation of powers in Venezuela and that she would accept it, but there were further rumblings on social media from other Chavez supporters who think Maduro is betraying the late leader's legacy. Some questioned the Supreme Court's stated reason for granting Lopez house arrest given he seemed healthy and fit when he saluted supporters, while others warned it would not halt protests and said it was an insult to the 2014 victims. To be sure, there are still many unanswered questions surrounding Lopez's release from jail, including how the move was negotiated and whether other releases could follow. But in any case, the decision to let him go home is not a game-changer for the opposition. Maduro retains a firm grip over institutions, including the crucial Supreme Court, and is pushing ahead with a new constitutional assembly with powers to rewrite the charter and supersede institutions.  The opposition warns the July 30 vote is a sham poll designed to consolidate his powers as a  dictator . They hope their own plebiscite next Sunday will further de-legitimize Maduro, although the process will be purely symbolic. The historically fragmented coalition will also have to adjust to the return of Lopez, seen by some in the opposition as hot-headed and domineering. He and fellow opposition leader Henrique Capriles, a sports-loving lawyer who advocates more moderate tactics, have clashed over strategy and leadership in the past and could jostle for a future presidential ticket. The terms of Lopez's house arrest have not been made public, so it is unclear to what extent he will be able to participate in future strategizing within the opposition. But the coalition is united in its street strategy and both men are banned from holding office, likely lessening tensions.  This is not the moment for individual rivalries. The big responsibility right now is to find a path forward for the country, so I wouldn't worry about divisions,  said political consultant Armando Briquet, a former campaign manager of two-time opposition presidential candidate Capriles.

The star-studded Diamond League meeting gave the cream of athletics a chance to test the facilities they will experience during the Aug. 4-13 world championships and organizers ensured there was a noisy finale when local hero Mo Farah closed out proceedings with an easy win over 3,000 meters. Jamaica's Thompson produced a late surge to get past regular rival Dafne Schippers to triumph in 10.94 seconds, impressive into a headwind of 1.4 meters and even more so as she was running in cushioned trainers to prevent injury.  The spikes I have I'm not confident with and hurt my Achilles so I’m running in flats,  Thompson said of her unusual footwear choice.  They have spikes but they are very petite. They are built especially for me and made lighter.  The wall of noise that brought Farah home for double distance gold in the stadium four years ago was a little more muted on Sunday but the half-full arena was still happy enough to watch him dominate a 3,000m lacking any real African threat. Farah duly delivered with a 55-second last lap to come home in 7:35.15, fine-tuning his build-up for his farewell appearance next month.  There's no place like home, I enjoy racing and not the other stuff,  said Farah, who was in the headlines again this week after leaked documents showed the IAAF had marked his biological passport as  likely doping  before further tests cleared him.  I’m only in control of my legs. Never will I fail a test,  he said.

At the other end of his career, compatriot Fred Kerley picked a great stage for his first outing as a professional athlete. Although he was beaten by U.S. champion Ameer Webb over 200 meters he will take heart from the performance when he returns to race in the 400m at the worlds. Slideshow (3 Images)Kerley, who has been blazing a record-breaking one-lap trail through his college career, clocked a personal best 20.24  behind Webb’s 20.13. Another nicely-timed world lead was delivered by injury-ravaged Nijel Amos, silver medalist on this track behind world-record breaking David Rudisha in the 2012 Olympics, as the Botswanan won a high-quality 800 in 1:43.18. Kendra Harrison set the current women’s 100m hurdles world record of 12.20 at this meeting last year – a minor consolation for missing out on the Olympics - and she made it 21 wins in a row since with an impressive time of 12.39 seconds. Just as happy with her second place in 12.48, her fastest for four years, was Australian 2012 Olympic champion Sally Pearson, who has overcome a series of injuries to get back into the mix just in time. As popular as Farah's win was, the best home performance of the day came from Tom Bosworth, who claimed an unofficial world record of five minutes 31.08 seconds, taking six seconds off the 26-year-old previous best, for the extremely rarely contested one mile race walk.  I wanted to make today special because it's the first race walk at a Diamond League,  he said.  In an event like mine, which isn’t seen on TV too much and is quite often misunderstood a lot, I think today was a great advert for race walking.

My view is that it's probably going to be dead,  Senator John McCain, a senior U.S. Republican, said on the CBS program,  Face the Nation.  The Senate bill, which faces unified Democratic opposition, has been further imperiled during a week-long recess where several Republican senators have had to return to their states and face constituents strongly opposed to the bill. Senators return to Washington on Monday. The Senate bill keeps much of Obamacare intact but strips away most of its funding. It repeals most Obamacare taxes, overhauls the law’s tax credits and ends its Medicaid expansion. It also goes beyond repealing Obamacare by cutting funding for the Medicaid program beginning in 2025. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said on Sunday on Fox News that U.S. President Donald Trump expected Congress to pass a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell aims to hold a vote on the legislation, which needs the support of at least 50 of the Senate's 52 Republicans, before a six-week recess that begins on July 29. Yet even McConnell cast doubt on the bill's prospects for passage last week. Speaking at a luncheon in his home state of Kentucky, McConnell said if Congress fails to follow through on a seven-year pledge to repeal Obamacare, then it must act to shore up private health insurance markets, comments seen as providing a pathway to a bipartisan deal to fix the health system.

Our decisions and actions are always based on doing what is right for patients,  Roche said. Last month, Roche said emicizumab cut the bleed rate by 87 percent in patients with resistance to standard therapy compared with those who received another treatment. At the time, analysts cited adverse events in Roche's studies including thrombotic microangiopathy -- damage to blood vessels in vital organs -- that accompanied repeated high doses of bypassing agents given to counter bleeds that occurred despite emicizumab treatment. Shire said in a statement the injunction sought to  prevent further dissemination of the inaccurate and misleading characterization of the serious adverse events that occurred in the HAVEN 1 Phase 3 trial of emicizumab.   The injunction also seeks to correct promotion of the primary data results relative to 'treated bleeds' (a secondary endpoint) as compared to the primary endpoint of 'number of bleeds over time' established at the outset of the trial,  Shire said.   The preliminary injunction is an interim measure and Roche can appeal it, Shire also said. Reporting by Joshua Franklin.

The so-called Alamo Fire, feeding on bone-dry vegetation, nearly tripled in size on Saturday to about 19,000 acres (7,700 hectares) on the border between San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties. More than 1,000 firefighters have been fighting the blaze that started on Thursday and was 10-percent contained as of Saturday afternoon, officials said. There were 40 uncontained large U.S. wildfires on Saturday, the National Weather Service said.  One of the largest was the Truckee Fire in Nevada, which was nearly 100,000 acres (40,460 hectares) in size, according to the InciWeb tracking service. There have been no immediate reports of fire-related deaths. No major injuries have been reported in California's Alamo fire, according to Santa Barbara County spokeswoman Gina DePinto. She said authorities are working to evacuate people from the blaze, aiming to stop it from reaching wineries to the south and electric transmission lines to the southeast. Heavy rainfall in parts of the West over the winter and spring helped delay the onset of the fire season, but also spurred the growth of dense vegetation that has dried out and become highly combustible in summertime heat.

The band, led by 57-year-old singer Bono, is playing the entire record to 2.4 million fans on their 2017 tour, including hits  With or Without You  and  I Still Haven't Found What I'm looking For . But they started the London show with early songs  Sunday Bloody Sunday ,  New Year's Day ,  Bad , and the Martin Luther King Jr-inspired  Pride (In the Name of Love) , which Bono dedicated to the  Rainbow people of London  who took part in the annual Pride LGBT march in the city earlier on Saturday.  The Joshua Tree  was played in sequence against a backdrop of video of U.S. landscapes such as Death Valley, and Americans standing in front of the Stars and the Stripes, shot by Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn who created the imagery on the original record. The group's best-selling album was released in 1987 when Ronald Reagan was U.S. President and his ideological soul mate Margaret Thatcher was in power in Britain. The tracks  Bullet the Blue Sky  and  Mothers of the Disappeared  were inspired by trips Bono made to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where he saw the impact of U.S. foreign policy, while  Red Hill Mining Town  was about the impact of the socially divisive miners' strike in Britain in the 1980s. Lead guitarist The Edge said in an interview with Rolling Stone in January that politically  things have kind of come full circle .  U2 perform during their U2: The Joshua Tree Tour, at Twickenham Stadium, London, Britain, July 8, 2017.Dylan Martinez It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn't have three years ago, four years ago',  he told the magazine.  Bono largely let the music speak for itself on Saturday, although a character called  Trump  was called a liar by the  good guy cowboy  in a Western movie-style clip.  The Joshua Tree , which sold more than 25 million copies, marked the pinnacle of the band tackling social and political issues through rock music.  Slideshow (19 Images)Their next album,  Rattle and Hum , did not match its success critically or commercially, and the band reinvented themselves in the 1990s by incorporating electronic and alternative rock into their sound. Seven of their later songs, including  Ultraviolet  and  One , were played as an encore, before Bono invited support act Noel Gallagher back on stage to sing  Don't Look Back in Anger , a song he wrote for his band Oasis.  The track became an anthem for Manchester after 22 people were killed by a suicide bomber in the city in May, and Gallagher also dedicated it to the victims of further attacks and a devastating tower block fire in London in June. U2, Gallagher and thousands of fans united in singing the anthem, ending a show that proved the enduring relevance and appeal of 1980s and 1990s rock music.    The Joshua Tree  tour plays seven other European cities before returning to the United States in September.

The country was ranked 10th in world nickel production in 2016 and sixth in cobalt. Cuba produced on average 74,000 tonnes of nickel plus cobalt during the first decade of this century, but the oldest of three plants was shuttered in 2012 and another has suffered from obsolescence and hurricane damage.

Proceeds from a sale of Alpargatas, whose shares are up sharply this year, could help pay down the heavy debt load of the owners, who are also involved in a corruption scandal. Cambuhy Investimentos Ltda and Itaúsa Investimentos SA (ITSA4.SA) are working to iron out terms of a deal by as early as next week, when exclusivity talks expire with Alpargatas' controlling shareholder J&F; Investimentos SA, the first person said. Itaúsa oversees the fortune of Brazil's Villela and Setubal families, who control São Paulo-based Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4.SA), Latin America's largest bank by assets. Cambuhy is the family office of Brazil's billionaire Moreira Salles family, also a major Itaú shareholder. J&F;, which owns 86 percent of Alpargatas and oversees the fortune of the billionaire Batista family, must raise cash to pay a 10.3 billion real leniency fine and refinance looming loan maturities, the people said. J&F;'s owners Joesley and Wesley Batista signed a leniency deal in May after admitting to bribing almost 1,900 politicians. Common shares of São Paulo-based Alpargatas (ALPA3.SA) are up 63 percent this year. The company's Havaianas flip flops, created in 1962 during Brazil's Bossa-Nova musical movement, are worn globally by celebrities from Blake Lively to Jennifer Aniston. Alpargatas, which also manages a wide array of Brazilian fashion brands including beachwear brand Osklen, is the first of J&F;'s assets lined up for sale in the wake of the Batista family's involvement in Brazil's worst-ever corruption scandal. Reuters reported the Cambuhy-led bid on June 16, which the companies confirmed a week later. Proceeds from sale of J&F;'s stake in Alpargatas will go to repay a 2.7 billion-real acquisition financing loan the Batistas took with state-controlled lender Caixa Econômica Federal, the first person said. The loan is under investigation by Brazil's audit court TCU for potential irregularities. J&F;, Cambuhy and Itaúsa declined to comment. The people asked not to be identified because talks remain private. Pressure from Creditors The pace of talks between J&F; and the Cambuhy-Itaúsa group gained steam in recent days. Creditors have been pressuring the Batistas to renegotiate more than 30 billion reais of debt at J&F; and JBS SA (JBSS3.SA), the world's No. 1 meatpacker, which the brothers also control. If the bid for Alpargatas succeeds, Cambuhy and Itaúsa will split equally the Batistas' stake, both companies said on June 26. The Batistas acquired Alpargatas in December 2015 from construction conglomerate Camargo Correa SA [PMORRC.UL], which was ensnared in the same scandal. J&F;'s controlling stakes in dairy producer Fábrica de Produtos Alimentícios Vigor SA and pulpmaker Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA are also on the block and their sale processes advancing, the people said.  The sale of Alpargatas, Vigor and Eldorado could raise 10 billion reais and cut J&F; debts by another 10 billion reais, one of the people said. Joesley, the youngest of the Batista siblings and a central figure in the family's leniency deal, is conducting talks to sell Alpargatas himself, the people added.

Jordan's flag carrier joins Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airline who each announced last week a lifting of the ban. In March, the United States banned laptops and other large electronic devices on direct flights originating at 10 airports in eight countries -- Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey -- to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. Royal Jordanian, which flies to New York, Chicago and Detroit from Amman, Jordan, lifted the ban after new security measures were implemented for U.S.-bound flights, airline President Stefan Pichler said in a statement. U.S. officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lifting of the ban affecting Royal Jordanian. The airline is the only carrier to fly direct to the United States from Amman. The United States announced on June 29 enhanced security measures for flights to the country which require additional time to screen passengers and personal electronic devices for possible explosives. The new U.S. security measures, which take effect within three weeks of the announcement, will affect around 325,000 passengers a day travelling on 180 airlines from 280 airports around the world, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Airlines that fail to meet the new security requirements could still face in-cabin restrictions on electronic devices. Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) has said it expects the ban to be lifted on flights from Jeddah and Riyadh by July 19. Royal Air Maroc also believes it can have the ban lifted for flights out of Casablanca's Mohammed V International Airport by July 19, a senior official from the state-owned airline told Reuters on July 6.

What has shifted in recent months is an acceptance that fiscal policy, touted around the turn of the year as the essential comeback kid after the shock election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, has not yet come back. Much of this is because of a lack of progress on Trump's tax cut agenda, dimming down what was called the  Trumpflation  trade in financial markets and now even calling into question a multi-year rally in the U.S. dollar.  But what this does is thrust central bankers -- who only six months ago were said to be waning in influence -- back into the spotlight. Many seasoned central bank watchers say past experience shows that until inflation really accelerates convincingly, and for a sustained period for reasons other than a rise in the price of oil, the best monetary policy is to be doing nothing.  The latest minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's policy discussions show a split over inflation, which is sure to cast unusually sharp focus on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's testimony to both houses of Congress in the coming week. Indeed, with the exception of persistent four-decade-low first-time claims for jobless benefits, U.S. economic data has been undercutting relatively modest expectations for the past several months, particularly on measures of inflation. Wage inflation across most of the developed world, widely viewed by economists as the most compelling and potent driver of sustained overall price inflation, hasn't picked up the way central bankers have predicted it would either.  The Fed, however, remains set on further interest rate rises, and is now contemplating how and when to start reducing its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, bloated by years of mass asset purchases as stimulus once it had no interest rate left to cut.  Of course the evolution of the economic data over the next few months remains of critical importance,  notes Investec's chief economist Philip Shaw.  In particular, will the momentum of the economy be maintained and is the recent run of soft inflation idiosyncratic, as most senior Fed officials seem to believe?

It's not only Yellen who might set the mood in the coming week. The Bank of Canada meets to set policy on July 12 following a run-up in the Canadian dollar, with markets leaning toward expecting the first rate rise in nearly seven years. The domestic debate is partly over whether a rate rise is now warranted in part to tamp down rampant urban housing markets -- particularly in Vancouver and Toronto -- as soaring real estate prices have pushed Canada's household debt to income ratio to near the highest in the world. Slideshow (2 Images)Like in other similar economies, Canada's consumer price inflation on its own does not point convincingly to a need for the Bank of Canada to deliver higher interest rates.   Its decision one way or the other could have an effect on markets beyond its shores as it will be seen as a proxy for policy normalization over a wider jurisdiction,  notes Shaw.  For some, discussion of  normalization  appears eerily similar to 2011, when the European Central Bank, faced with a similarly shaky-looking inflation outlook, raised interest rates in what is now regarded as a mistake, arguing higher rates would be supportive of business confidence.  A punishing sovereign debt crisis followed and a period of eye-wateringly high unemployment, ushering in an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet by well over a trillion euros and counting, along with negative interest rate policy.  For now, the ECB appears to be moving very gingerly toward unveiling how and when it will trim back its tens of billions worth of monthly bond purchases, but that date is approaching. Some of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee also now think that now is the time to raise rates -- despite the  uncertainty of Britain starting to negotiate its way out of the European Union. They are prompted by a surge in inflation caused in large part from a plunge in sterling after the Brexit vote. For now, they remain in a minority, but the possibility has supported the pound and markets have been put on notice.  But a change of mood appears to have taken place at the Bank of Japan, however, which is backing off initial attempts to signal an imminent shift away from its ultra-easy monetary policy. On Friday it launched a bond-buying bonanza, offering to snap up unlimited quantities in order to calm markets.

May had warmly welcomed assurances on Saturday by U.S. President Donald Trump that a  very powerful  trade deal with Britain would be reached  very, very quickly  after Britain leaves the EU. Seeking to reassert her authority over a Brexit process thrown into chaos by a botched snap election last month, May described talks on trade with Trump and other world leaders at a G20 meeting as a  powerful vote of confidence  in Britain.  But one of her senior ministers dampened that enthusiasm on Sunday, in a sign of the difficult task May faces in uniting her own party behind a single exit strategy as key legislation is due to enter parliament next week.  It wouldn't be enough on its own, no,  Lidington told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.  But it would be a very good thing to have - as would trade deals with the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America.  The government has touted the ability to strike bilateral trade deals, rather than EU-wide deal negotiated by Brussels, as one of the key benefits of leaving the bloc. Lidington campaigned strongly for Britain to remain in the EU before the 2016 referendum, but has since said he accepts the outcome of that vote. The Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby group, also warned against placing too much emphasis on a potential deal with the United States.  Not every trade deal is necessarily a good and fair trade deal for both parties,  CBI President Paul Drechsler told Sky television.   Britain's Justice Secretary, David Lidington, speaks on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show in London, Britain July 9, 2017. Jeff Overs/BBC handout via REUTERS The USA has one of the best negotiating teams in the world in terms of trade deals. We don't want to walk into a bear hug - I would be wary of trying to be too fast on a trade deal.  Leadership Relaunch May is expected to make a speech on Tuesday marking a year since she inherited power following Britain's surprise vote to leave the EU. The speech is seen as an attempt to move on from a tumultuous 12 months in which May set out a hardline approach to leaving the EU and called an election, but then failed to persuade the public to back her and lost her outright majority in parliament.  She has struck a deal with a small Northern Irish political party to support her minority government. Her weakened status has led to speculation that members of her Conservative Party - historically split between eurosceptics and more pro-European members - would be prepared to oust her if they did not get their way. Party unity will be tested by legislation which is due to be presented to parliament next week, outlining the government's plan to translate all EU law in British law as part of its preparation for leaving. A report in the Sunday Times newspaper cited anonymous sources as saying pro-European lawmakers could demand concessions in the bill.  A separate report sourced to an unnamed Conservative in the Mail on Sunday also said a 'Kamikaze' group of Brexit-supporting Conservatives would be prepared to oust her and force a new election if she did water down her Brexit plans. Dismissing those reports, Lidington said:  I’ve been in parliament 25 years and almost every July a combination of too much sun and too much warm prosecco leads to gossipy stories in the media.

Twelve years on and that same man, Gilles Muller, could ambush Nadal's attempt to land a third title. As Wimbledon swings into its second week Nadal is looking supreme, but 34-year-old grasscourt specialist Muller represents an altogether different challenge with his old-school serve-and-volley style that so bamboozled the Spaniard 12 years ago. Of the 16 survivors in the men's draw, Muller is most likely to be seen following his serve into the net -- a tactic he has employed on a quarter of his deliveries so far, racking up an impressive 82 percent success rate. All the more surprising considering there is not a single grass court in Luxembourg and 16th seed Muller admits he had not a clue how to play on the surface when he first encountered it.  I remember when I first played on grass, it was at a junior invitational tournament at (London's) Queen's Club,  Muller told Reuters.  It wasn't love at first sight! I got killed in my first match by a Mexican called Santiago Gonzales.  In the beginning I had no clue what to do but after that I got to the junior final (at Wimbledon). I fell in love with grass pretty quickly. Not love at first sight, but pretty fast.  Muller used those lawn skills to his advantage in 2005 when he faced Nadal, who a few weeks earlier had won the first of his 10 French Open titles, in the second round of Wimbledon -- giving the young Mallorcan a four-set schooling. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 7, 2017   Luxembourg’s Gilles Muller celebrates winning the third round match against Great Britain’s Aljaz BedeneTony O'Brien I've got good memories facing Rafa here,  Muller, who met Nadal again in 2011, losing in straight sets, added.  The first time I played him here I beat him, Second time I lost in three sets, but I had a set point in the first set and was up a mini-break in the second set (tiebreak).  It's true I beat him in 2005 but he's improved a little bit on grass since then! He's won the title twice.  Muller is only the second man from Luxembourg to appear in a grand slam tournament, the other being Gaston Wampach who played in the 1946 and 1947 French Open tournaments.  Every time I step on court it seems like some kind of first for a Luxembourg player,  Muller, who has reached the last 16 at Wimbledon for the first time, said. Beating Nadal would go off the scale back home and, while victory would be a huge shock, Muller will walk on Court One feeling confident -- especially as the surface on that showcourt plays quicker than the outside courts.  Of course, the quicker the better for me,  Muller, bumped up from his ATP ranking of 26 to 16th seed at Wimbledon after a superb run in the European grasscourt season, said.  I played on Court 18 and 12 here this week and they were the slowest grass courts I've ever played on.  Of course I feel that I can beat Rafa. He is looking good and injury free. But if I didn't think I could win I would not bother going out on the court.

The central bank, faced with accelerating inflation, on Thursday raised rates by 200 basis points for the second policy meeting in a row, wrongfooting economists who had forecast no change. Deputy finance minister Mohamed Meait told Reuters on Saturday the hike was only temporary. Cairo's blue chip index edged down 0.1 percent, a far milder reaction than the 2.5 percent drop that followed a previous rate hike on May 21. Analysts at Naeem Brokerage said in a note that the market might witness a slight temporary correction, adding that banks might benefit because they expected higher investment income to offset delinquencies and slower credit growth. The largest listed lender, Commercial International Bank added 1.4 percent on Sunday.

In their statement late on Thursday, the four Arab states said the initial list of 13 demands they had put to Qatar was now void and they pledged further political, economic and legal steps against the emirate. Gulf funds not including Qataris were net buyers by a tiny margin for the first time since the crisis erupted, bourse data showed. They made up a little over 5 percent of the total market turnover on Sunday. Locals made up a little under three-quarters and were net buyers. The Abu Dhabi index added 0.3 percent, as shares of Dana Gas, which made up a little half of the total market turnover on Sunday, rebounded 1.5 percent. On Thursday Dana fell 1.4 percent after sources told Reuters that London's High Court planned to hold a full hearing in September on efforts by the company to restructure $700 million of Islamic bonds. In neighbouring Dubai shares favoured by short-term retail investors were the most active, with builder Arabtec jumping 7.4 percent to 3.47 dirhams.  The trend shall remain bullish towards the next barrier at 3.56 dirhams, where it may attract profit taking, but a break over shall ignite aggressive buying until the previous highs of 4.00 - 4.20 dirhams,  said a note by NBAD Securities.

Pecresse had been put forward by colleagues as a potential national leader of The Republicans (LR), which like all of France's established parties is feeling the pressure after President Emmanuel Macron and his one year-old centrist grouping Republic on the Move (LREM) swept to power earlier this year. But naming the new movement 'Libre' which translates as 'Free!', Pecresse, who was a minister under former conservative president Nicolas Sarkozy, said the LR leadership battle would be  sterile  for as long as the party had not found its true direction. She told Sunday newspaper Le Journal de Dimanche she would seek to position her grouping between those who have joined Macron's government - including prime minister Edouard Philippe - and those who would follow a line she called  aggressive opposition,  and which has gathered around the party's right wing. She said she wanted  an authentic right, neither subsumed by Macron nor porous with the (far right) National Front (FN.)   Whatever his failings ... Macron would always be a more rallying force, than a right turned in upon its conservative fringe,  she said. After his victory in the presidential election in May, Macron's LREM and its allies won 350 seats in the 577-seat lower house, versus 30 seats for the Socialist party and 112 for LR during parliamentary elections in June. There are also deep divisions in the Socialist party after five years in government under Francois Hollande's presidency - made worse by the emergence of France Unbowed, a leftist movement led by the charismatic Jean-Luc Melenchon. Hollande's prime minister, the pro-business Manuel Valls, has quit the party, as has Benoit Hamon, who was from the left of the party and came fifth in the first round of the presidential election. On Saturday, the Socialists said they had elected a provisional management committee composed of 8 men and 8 women to run its affairs while it decides how to respond to its defeat.

The migrants appeared to have been smuggled into Libya by foot and have perished due to high temperatures and hunger, said Khaled al-Raqi, a Red Crescent spokesman in the east Libyan city of Tobruk. They were found on Saturday more than 400 km (250 miles) south of Tobruk, in the Jaghboub desert, Raqi said. Seven of the migrants were identified from papers or identity cards, and the rest were thought to be Egyptian from their appearance, he said. The seven came from Assiuyt and Minya, areas on the River Nile south of Cairo, and from Kafr el Sheikh, in the Nile Delta north of Cairo. Libyan television station Libya Alaan broadcast footage of Libyan Red Crescent workers offloading bodies from the back of a truck into black body bags. Egyptian migrants have tried to cross to Europe from the African coast, particularly from Libya, though boats have also increasingly departed from Egypt. Most Libyan smugglers sending migrants by sea toward Europe do so from western Libya. Many Egyptians and migrants of other nationalities also work in Libya, though fewer than in the past.  The Egyptian embassy to Libya, which is currently based in Cairo, said it was working with the Libyan authorities to repatriate the seven migrants confirmed to be Egyptian, and to check the identities of the other 12 migrants.    Reporting by Ayman al-Warfalli in Benghazi, and Lisa Barrington and Amina Ismail in Cairo; Writing by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-egypt-migrants-idUSKBN19U0JV"},

Trump campaigned in last year's presidential election on cracking down on China for its trade practices, but he softened his rhetoric after taking office, saying he wanted to work with China on the nuclear issue. When the two leaders first met in April at Trump's Florida resort, they appeared to hit it off. Trump called Xi a  good man  as he urged him to use Beijing's economic clout to force North Korea to curb its nuclear weapons program. Lately, Trump has expressed some impatience on China's role in North Korea - particularly after Pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe could have the range to reach Alaska, and parts of the U.S. West Coast. His administration made new arms sales to Taiwan, imposed sanctions on two Chinese citizens and a shipping company and put China on a global human trafficking list. It also accused a Chinese bank of laundering money for Pyongyang. The White House is also debating trade actions against Beijing, including tariffs on its steel exports and a few days before the G20 talks, Trump complained that trade between China and North Korea had grown.  But he showed none of that impatience on Saturday, when the leaders met at the invitation of Xi at the tail end of the G20 in Germany.  It's an honor to have you as a friend,  Trump told Xi, telling him he appreciated actions he had already taken on North Korea.

It may take longer than I'd like. It may take longer than you'd like. But there will be success in the end one way or the other,  Trump said. Speaking to reporters later on Air Force One, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump-Xi meeting lasted over an hour-and-a-half, and they had  substantive discussions  about how to deal with North Korea together.  In regards to China, we had very direct discussions about North Korea. We had very direct discussions about military and security cooperation,  Mnuchin said.    I think that President Trump made very clear to President Xi that he is focused on this issue, and wants to move forward and make progress. And I think President Xi gave a very interesting perspective from their standpoint,  he added.

Xi stressed the importance of talks with North Korea, and said China's navy will join next year's U.S.-led Pacific Rim military exercises. Xinhua said Xi stressed to Trump China's position that it adheres to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and maintaining peace and stability there. Slideshow (2 Images)While China has been angered by North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile tests, it also blames the United States and South Korea for worsening tension with their military exercises.  China has many times talked about its principled position, namely that at the same time as the international community making necessary responses to North Korean acts that go against U.N. Security Council resolutions, they must step up efforts to promote talks and manage and control the situation,  Xinhua said, citing Xi. Xi also reiterated China's opposition to the U.S. deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, Xinhua said. China says THAAD threatens its security, despite U.S. and South Korean assurances it is aimed only at defending against North Korea. Both leaders agreed to maintain close communication and coordination on the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, Xinhua said. In a statement released on Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Xi and Trump had  enhanced mutual understanding  about the North Korea issue and  confirmed the broad direction of using peaceful means to resolve this issue . Trump also mentioned trade imbalances in his meeting with Xi, calling it a  very, very big issue  that he would address.  I know that China in particular, which is a great trading partner, we will be able to do something that will be equitable and reciprocal,  Trump said. Senior officials from both countries will meet in Washington on July 19 to discuss economic and trade issues.

With Africa's biggest economy mired in recession, delegations including Acting President Yemi Osinbajo have held talks since February with community leaders in the restive oil-producing states in Nigeria's southeast. Oil exports are now set to exceed 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, the highest in 17 months, from as little as just over 1 million bpd at certain points last year. That is due to a steady decline in attacks on pipelines, providing a much-needed injection of cash into Nigerian government coffers. But ex-militants and local chieftains say that since those  town hall  discussions, little has been done - the government has not followed up on issues raised, is stalling on key demands and has not even appointed a full-time negotiating team. If the Niger Delta people continue to feel Abuja is ignoring their needs, leaders say they will resort to the only tactic that has ever yielded results: attacks on oil facilities.  The people of the Niger Delta can hold this government or any government to ransom because we are the people feeding the nation,  said Godspower Gbenekama, a chief in the Kingdom of Gbaramatu.  This peace is a graveyard peace,  he said.  Nobody can assure anybody that nothing will happen in the Delta.  A spokesman for the acting president rejected suggestions the government was not doing enough.   The government has not reneged and will never renege on any agreement,  he said, pointing to more spending on an amnesty program for ex-militants and progress on a clean-up project. He added it was just a matter of time for other agreements to come to fruition, such as the planned opening of a flagship university in October and of small-scale refineries with community ownership in the fourth quarter.  An inter-ministerial group met regularly with Osinbajo to discuss the Niger Delta and a  technical committee  liaised between the government and affected communities, he also said. Some locals, however, are in no mood to wait. In a sign of their mounting frustration, groups such as the New Delta Avengers and the Niger Delta Marine Force have formed in recent months.  Call for resuming attacks when the government is diligent in actualizing the terms of the agreements and requests made will not help matters,  said the acting president's spokesman.  All About Revenue  A boat travels down a river near the southeastern oil city of Warri, in Delta state, Nigeria June 18, 2017.Tife OwolabiThat the Delta needs help is not in dispute. Roads are pitted and scarred. Holes gape in the walls of school buildings and playing fields are flooded. Ramshackle stalls crowd the streets, standing in pools of muddy water and blocking traffic. Every ten meters are signs offering hope of a different nature: Communion with God; Redemption Ministries; Hope Centre Parish; Success Education Centre; High Flyers House of Bliss Ministries. But the communities of the Niger Delta also have more earthly demands. Slideshow (8 Images)Some want environmental clean-ups from oil spills that have devastated swathes of forest and waterways; others want roads and better power supply; others jobs and the regional university. Many in the Delta are cynical about the government's stated desire to improve the region's lot. The peace talks are  lies and deceit,  said Annkio Briggs, a leading activist in the southeastern oil city of Port Harcourt.  This latest Osinbajo move ... is all about revenue. How do we get the Niger Delta calm enough that we can continue to derive revenue to sustain our budgets?  Others are also bitter that the government only appears to respond to violent action, while peaceful activism and protests have historically achieved little. The government  is treading on a path that is disastrous... setting a precedent that they will only negotiate with the Delta when they start blowing stuff up,  said Richard Akinaka, who represented the youth in Rivers state for a meeting with Osinbajo. He dismissed the meeting with one word -  bogus . The communities have also asked for ownership of oil blocks, and for all states in Nigeria to become fiscally independent - a move that would see oil revenues pooled in the southeast.     The problems of the Delta may not be easily solved: enmity runs deep between locals and the federal government, violence is often the answer and some of the demands may not be as attainable as community leaders hope.  We don't have a very big agenda,  said Gbenekama, the Gbaramatu kingdom chief.  The general agenda of the Niger Delta people is the political and fiscal restructuring of this nation.

Hours after his pre-dawn transfer from the Ramo Verde military jail, Lopez appeared over a wall of his Caracas house, waving the Venezuelan flag and punching the air before a crowd of supporters who cheered and cried upon seeing him. In a message released by his party, the 46-year-old hardliner urged opposition supporters to continue street protests against President Nicolas Maduro, which are in their fourth month and have led to at least 90 deaths.   If maintaining my fight for freedom means running the risk of returning to a cell in Ramo Verde, I am more than happy to take it,  he said in the message read by Freddy Guevara, the No. 2 in Lopez's Popular Will party.  Today, I am a prisoner in my house, but so are the Venezuelan people. What kept me going in the toughest days was knowing that whatever suffering I endured was nothing compared to our people.  Lopez's release, aided by foreign pressure, gave some rare cheer to Venezuela's opposition who have otherwise seen Maduro give few concessions in their demands for freedom of activists, general elections and fixes for an economic crisis.  Despite being under house arrest, he showed his face to the country,  said Maria Garcia, 36, a business consultant, outside his house.  What we need to do now is stay in the street, because we need to achieve not just the freedom of Leopoldo but also the freedom of the Venezuelan people.  Fresh opposition street rallies were planned for Sunday. Presidential Ambition A photogenic, Harvard-educated former mayor and economist, Lopez would likely be a popular opposition presidential candidate if able to run in any future vote.  Related CoverageVenezuela's Lopez waves to supporters outside home: witnessesHe is serving a sentence of nearly 14 years. While the socialist Maduro may be calculating Lopez's return home will ease pressure on him, opposition leaders presented it as a triumph for their protest strategy and a sign the government was caving.   It was not clear, however, how Lopez's presence at home could materially weaken Maduro, who is plowing ahead with a plan to create a parliamentary superbody that will be able to rewrite the constitution and even dissolve state institutions. The opposition has long called Lopez a political prisoner, and leaders around the world, including U.S. President Donald Trump, had been pressing for his full freedom. The U.S. State Department called the decision a  significant step in the right direction,  while urging full freedom for Lopez and another 400 opposition prisoners. Maduro for years opposed measures to release Lopez, describing him as a dangerous terrorist who sought to overthrow him through street violence. Government supporters also often note Lopez's role in a short-lived 2002 coup against the late former leader Hugo Chavez when he helped arrest a minister. Venezuela's opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, who has been granted house arrest after more than three years in jail, salutes supporters, in Caracas, Venezuela July 8, 2017.Andres Martinez CasaresOn Saturday, Maduro extended an olive branch of sorts.  I as head of state accept the (Supreme Court's) decision, and what's more, I support the decision. And you all know my absolute and profound differences with LL,  Maduro said, referring to Lopez only by his initials.  God willing this decision ... will be understood, and Mr. LL, after almost four years in Ramo Verde, will give a message of rectification and peace.  Venezuela's Supreme Court said Lopez had been given the measure due to health problems, but his family countered that he is in good shape and he looked robust as he waved enthusiastically. The release was aided in part by the involvement of former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who has for years maintained talks with the Maduro government, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Venezuelan officials said. Slideshow (16 Images)At Maduro's behest, Venezuela on July 30 will elect a controversial Constituent Assembly.  The opposition says that is a power grab meant to keep the socialists in office and annul the existing opposition-controlled legislature against the will of the people.    Supporters Thrilled Several hundred supporters rallied through the day outside Lopez's home in the upscale Caracas neighborhood of Los Palos Grandes, some wearing shirts emblazoned with Lopez's face.  They waved Venezuela's flag, chanted slogans and set off fireworks to celebrate.  I think this is the first day of the transition,  said Maria Antonieta Witzka, 57, a physical therapist.  The government is realizing that we are the majority.  Though a hero to many, Lopez has also faced criticism from some within the opposition for at times being headstrong and domineering. He founded the Popular Will party after splitting with the First Justice party that he had also helped found. Though Lopez had publicly called for peaceful resistance to Maduro in 2014 and was behind bars during most of the unrest that year which killed 43 people, prosecutors said his speeches sent subliminal messages and constituted a call to violence.  One of the prosecutors who led the case later fled the country and said the proceeding had been a mockery of justice. Lopez is the scion of wealthy families and a direct descendant of the sister of Latin American independence hero Simon Bolivar as well as of Venezuela's first president, Cristobal Mendoza. Pro-government critics paint him as a dangerous radical in the pocket of Venezuela's wealthy elite and the U.S. government.

The proposed deal is the latest in wave of mergers and acquisitions in global container shipping that has left the top six shipping lines controlling 63 percent of the market. OOIL's shipping subsidiary, OOCL, has a 2.7 percent slice of the market.  COSCO Shipping is offering HK$78.67 for each OOIL share, a premium of 37.8 percent over OOIL's closing price of HK$57.10 on its last trading date, the companies said in filings with the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges on Sunday. OOIL's controlling shareholders had on Friday agreed to sell their 68.7 percent stake at that price to COSCO Shipping, which is making the offer with Shanghai Port International Group (SIPG) (600018.SS) that will take 9.9 percent, they said.  COSCO Shipping will have a fleet of more than 400 vessels and capacity exceeding 2.9 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) should the deal go through, it said. This would make it the world's third largest container shipping line after Denmark's Maersk Line MAERSKb.Co and Switzerland's Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), according to Singapore-based transport research firm Crucial Perspective. It is currently the fourth-largest behind France's CMA CGM [CMACG.UL].  COSCO Shipping Holdings believes this acquisition will enable both COSCO Shipping Lines and OOIL to realize synergies, enhance profitability and achieve sustainable growth in the long term,  the Chinese group said in the statement.  A COSCO container is seen at the Noatum container terminal near Bilboa, in Santurtzi, Spain June 14, 2017.Vincent West - RTS170T5OOCL was founded in 1969 by Hong Kong shipping magnate Tung Chao-yung, whose son, Tung Chee-chen is chairman, president and chief executive of the company, while several Tung children are in senior management roles. The two companies in January dismissed merger rumors but analysts said that OOCL was still a likely bid target due to its long profitable history and relatively low leverage. Both firms are also part of the  Ocean Alliance  partnership, which also includes CMA CGM and Evergreen Marine Corp (2603.TW), that was formed last year to take on the rival grouping of Maersk Line and MSC. COSCO Shipping itself was created from the state-driven merger of former rivals China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company and China Shipping Group. Shares in the firm, which flagged a return to first-half profit last week, have been suspended since May 16. It said it would finance its part of the deal through external debt financing and that the transaction was still subject to anti-trust reviews by Chinese and U.S. government authorities.  The companies said that they plan to retain OOIL's listing status and maintain its global headquarters and presence in Hong Kong to support the city as a global maritime center.  Should the deal fall through, COSCO Shipping has also agreed to pay OOIL a reverse termination fee of $253 million, they said  UBS AG Hong Kong Branch (UBSG.S) is advising COSCO Shipping and SIPG, while J.P.

That was the same number as the first half of 2016, with 3.2 billion euros raised.  There are many operations (listings) that have been postponed,  the CEO said, citing the French and Dutch elections as the reason.  I am extremely confident over the second-half,  Boujnah said in an interview at a business conference in the French southeastern city of Aix-en-Provence. The group, which owns stock exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Brussels, has trimmed its costs since its own share listing in 2014 and wants to use its firepower to better compete with bigger rivals London Stock Exchange Group (LSE.L) and Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE).

Earlier this year, Euronext had agreed to buy Paris-based clearing house LCH SA for 510 million euros ($538 million), pending a Deutsche-Boerse-LSE tie-up agreement.

The withdrawal from the Incirlik base, approved by the German parliament last month, marks a further step in one of many bilateral disputes, ranging from a post-coup clampdown by Ankara to Turkish political campaigning in Germany. German tornado jets were due to keep operating out of Incirlik at least until the end of July as part of a mission providing reconnaissance aircraft to support U.S.-led coalition operations against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the meantime the necessary material was to be moved to a new air base in Jordan, where the planes are scheduled to be deployed by October. A German air tanker refueller left Incirlik for the Jordan base on Sunday, the ministry spokesman told Reuters. A Turkish official confirmed that the withdrawal had started, saying Germany's defense minister had informed her Turkish counterpart of the withdrawal date when they met during the NATO summit in Brussels. Turkey had refused to allow German lawmakers to make what they saw as a routine visit to the base, saying that Berlin needed to improve its attitude towards Turkey first. Germany had banned some Turkish politicians from campaigning on its soil for a referendum on giving Erdogan sweeping new powers Ankara responded by accusing Berlin of  Nazi-like  tactics and reigniting the dispute over Incirlik.

Three weeks after the June 14 fire, neither the two companies involved in the cladding on the Grenfell Tower nor the local authority which enforces the building codes have addressed questions from Reuters about whether that test was ever conducted and its outcome. The test is required to show whether both materials when used together were sufficiently resistant to combustion.  Without proof that it had been carried out, the cladding system would not have met building regulations.     The cladding work carried about by Rydon Group Ltd, the main contractor on the 2014-2016 refurbishment of the building, and its subcontractor Harley Facades involved attaching insulation boards to the tower's concrete facade and covering them with aluminum composite panels.      France's Saint Gobain said the insulation used was its brand of polyisocyanurate (PIR) called Celotex RS5000.     The aluminum panels, which had a polyethylene plastic core were called Reynobond PE, and made by New York-based ArconicInc, previously known as Alcoa Inc.     If all the elements of the insulation system had achieved a separate and demanding government standard called  limited combustibility , in separate tests, then a combined test would not have been necessary, according to the building regulations.      But Reynobond PE and Celotex did not meet the combustibility test by themselves, according to safety experts and product specifications published by the manufacturers.       This meant that the two materials combined would need to pass another test known as the BS 8414 test, according to the building regulations. This involves setting a fire under a three-storey mock-up of the proposed wall construction.      Both standards, set out in the guidelines to the building code, aim to prevent a fire spreading quickly from inside and up the exterior walls, something that happened at Grenfell Tower.     In a June 29 email, a spokeswoman for Rydon Group Ltd says it “met all building regulations” but did not say if the BS 8414test stipulated in the building codes had been conducted.        The building control department of the local Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council (RBKC), which is responsible for checking that the building and plans are consistent with regulations, declined to say if it had checked the tests had been carried out.        Police think the cladding system at Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of last month's fatal fire. They have said they are investigating possible criminal behavior and the role of all the companies involved in the building.      The Department for Communities and Local Government, the government department which is responsible for setting the regulations enforced by building control, has said the cladding system used at Grenfell did not comply with the building rules it oversees. It has not said why and declined to answer detailed questions on its legal reasoning.    (Link to graphic of Grenfell Tower cladding system:tmsnrt.rs/2t97Ugs)            Combustibility     The test used to assess combined materials must be commissioned from a government approved independent testing agency. Reuters was unable to determine which, if any lab was used.     Rydon, which had a turnover of 249 million pounds last year,  told Reuters the materials it used were suitable for use in tall buildings.     “Laboratory testing of the fire resistance of the cladding system used at Grenfell Tower was carried out prior to installation. Please see attached BBA certificate,” the spokeswoman said in the June 29 email.     The certificate Rydon provided showed the panels met a separate standard on the surface spread of fire.      Asked specifically about the BS 8414 test, the Rydon spokeswoman said: “More technical questions would be better directed at Harley as it’s their area of expertise.”     Executives and a spokesman at Harley, a small company with few assets, declined to comment for this story. It said in a statement on its website last month it was not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower.     An official at RBKC, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, declined to provide details of the specification it approved or what checks it conducted to ensure the actual construction met the approved plan, citing the ongoing police investigation into the fire.     A spokeswoman for Saint Gobain said its BR 135combustibility certification of Celotex was based on tests conducted with a non-combustible cement façade panel. She declined to say if Celotex had ever passed the BS 8414 test with a flammable façade panel such as Reynobond PE.

German tornado jets were due to keep operating out of Incirlik at least until the end of July as part of a mission providing reconnaissance aircraft to support U.S.-led coalition operations against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the meantime the necessary material was to be moved to a new air base in Jordan, where the planes are scheduled to be deployed by October. A German air tanker refueller left Incirlik for the Jordan base on Sunday, the ministry spokesman told Reuters. A Turkish official confirmed that the withdrawal had started, saying Germany's defense minister had informed her Turkish counterpart of the withdrawal date when they met during the NATO summit in Brussels. Turkey had refused to allow German lawmakers to make what they saw as a routine visit to the base, saying that Berlin needed to improve its attitude towards Turkey first. Germany had banned some Turkish politicians from campaigning on its soil for a referendum on giving Erdogan sweeping new powers Ankara responded by accusing Berlin of  Nazi-like  tactics and reigniting the dispute over Incirlik. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday that a bilateral meeting with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had revealed  deep differences  between the two NATO allies.

Three weeks after the June 14 fire, neither the two companies involved in the cladding on the Grenfell Tower nor the local authority which enforces the building codes have addressed questions from Reuters about whether that test was ever conducted and its outcome. The test is required to show whether both materials when used together were sufficiently resistant to combustion.  Without proof that it had been carried out, the cladding system would not have met building regulations.     The cladding work carried about by Rydon Group Ltd, the main contractor on the 2014-2016 refurbishment of the building, and its subcontractor Harley Facades involved attaching insulation boards to the tower's concrete facade and covering them with aluminum composite panels.      France's Saint Gobain said the insulation used was its brand of polyisocyanurate (PIR) called Celotex RS5000.     The aluminum panels, which had a polyethylene plastic core were called Reynobond PE, and made by New York-based ArconicInc, previously known as Alcoa Inc.     If all the elements of the insulation system had achieved a separate and demanding government standard called  limited combustibility , in separate tests, then a combined test would not have been necessary, according to the building regulations.      But Reynobond PE and Celotex did not meet the combustibility test by themselves, according to safety experts and product specifications published by the manufacturers.       This meant that the two materials combined would need to pass another test known as the BS 8414 test, according to the building regulations. This involves setting a fire under a three-storey mock-up of the proposed wall construction.      Both standards, set out in the guidelines to the building code, aim to prevent a fire spreading quickly from inside and up the exterior walls, something that happened at Grenfell Tower.     In a June 29 email, a spokeswoman for Rydon Group Ltd says it “met all building regulations” but did not say if the BS 8414test stipulated in the building codes had been conducted.        The building control department of the local Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council (RBKC), which is responsible for checking that the building and plans are consistent with regulations, declined to say if it had checked the tests had been carried out.        Police think the cladding system at Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of last month's fatal fire. They have said they are investigating possible criminal behavior and the role of all the companies involved in the building.      The Department for Communities and Local Government, the government department which is responsible for setting the regulations enforced by building control, has said the cladding system used at Grenfell did not comply with the building rules it oversees. It has not said why and declined to answer detailed questions on its legal reasoning.    (Link to graphic of Grenfell Tower cladding system:tmsnrt.rs/2t97Ugs)            Combustibility     The test used to assess combined materials must be commissioned from a government approved independent testing agency. Reuters was unable to determine which, if any lab was used.     Rydon, which had a turnover of 249 million pounds last year,  told Reuters the materials it used were suitable for use in tall buildings.     “Laboratory testing of the fire resistance of the cladding system used at Grenfell Tower was carried out prior to installation. Please see attached BBA certificate,” the spokeswoman said in the June 29 email.     The certificate Rydon provided showed the panels met a separate standard on the surface spread of fire.      Asked specifically about the BS 8414 test, the Rydon spokeswoman said: “More technical questions would be better directed at Harley as it’s their area of expertise.”     Executives and a spokesman at Harley, a small company with few assets, declined to comment for this story. It said in a statement on its website last month it was not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower.     An official at RBKC, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, declined to provide details of the specification it approved or what checks it conducted to ensure the actual construction met the approved plan, citing the ongoing police investigation into the fire.     A spokeswoman for Saint Gobain said its BR 135combustibility certification of Celotex was based on tests conducted with a non-combustible cement façade panel. She declined to say if Celotex had ever passed the BS 8414 test with a flammable façade panel such as Reynobond PE.

With Africa's biggest economy mired in recession, delegations including Acting President Yemi Osinbajo have held talks since February with community leaders in the restive oil-producing states in Nigeria's southeast. Oil exports are now set to exceed 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, the highest in 17 months, from as little as just over 1 million bpd at certain points last year. That is due to a steady decline in attacks on pipelines, providing a much-needed injection of cash into Nigerian government coffers. But ex-militants and local chieftains say that since those  town hall  discussions, little has been done - the government has not followed up on issues raised, is stalling on key demands and has not even appointed a full-time negotiating team. If the Niger Delta people continue to feel Abuja is ignoring their needs, leaders say they will resort to the only tactic that has ever yielded results: attacks on oil facilities.  The people of the Niger Delta can hold this government or any government to ransom because we are the people feeding the nation,  said Godspower Gbenekama, a chief in the Kingdom of Gbaramatu.  This peace is a graveyard peace,  he said.  Nobody can assure anybody that nothing will happen in the Delta.  A spokesman for the acting president rejected suggestions the government was not doing enough.   The government has not reneged and will never renege on any agreement,  he said, pointing to more spending on an amnesty program for ex-militants and progress on a clean-up project. He added it was just a matter of time for other agreements to come to fruition, such as the planned opening of a flagship university in October and of small-scale refineries with community ownership in the fourth quarter.  An inter-ministerial group met regularly with Osinbajo to discuss the Niger Delta and a  technical committee  liaised between the government and affected communities, he also said. Some locals, however, are in no mood to wait. In a sign of their mounting frustration, groups such as the New Delta Avengers and the Niger Delta Marine Force have formed in recent months.  Call for resuming attacks when the government is diligent in actualizing the terms of the agreements and requests made will not help matters,  said the acting president's spokesman.  All About Revenue  A boat travels down a river near the southeastern oil city of Warri, in Delta state, Nigeria June 18, 2017.Tife OwolabiThat the Delta needs help is not in dispute. Roads are pitted and scarred. Holes gape in the walls of school buildings and playing fields are flooded. Ramshackle stalls crowd the streets, standing in pools of muddy water and blocking traffic. Every ten meters are signs offering hope of a different nature: Communion with God; Redemption Ministries; Hope Centre Parish; Success Education Centre; High Flyers House of Bliss Ministries. But the communities of the Niger Delta also have more earthly demands. Slideshow (8 Images)Some want environmental clean-ups from oil spills that have devastated swathes of forest and waterways; others want roads and better power supply; others jobs and the regional university. Many in the Delta are cynical about the government's stated desire to improve the region's lot. The peace talks are  lies and deceit,  said Annkio Briggs, a leading activist in the southeastern oil city of Port Harcourt.  This latest Osinbajo move ... is all about revenue. How do we get the Niger Delta calm enough that we can continue to derive revenue to sustain our budgets?  Others are also bitter that the government only appears to respond to violent action, while peaceful activism and protests have historically achieved little. The government  is treading on a path that is disastrous... setting a precedent that they will only negotiate with the Delta when they start blowing stuff up,  said Richard Akinaka, who represented the youth in Rivers state for a meeting with Osinbajo. He dismissed the meeting with one word -  bogus . The communities have also asked for ownership of oil blocks, and for all states in Nigeria to become fiscally independent - a move that would see oil revenues pooled in the southeast.     The problems of the Delta may not be easily solved: enmity runs deep between locals and the federal government, violence is often the answer and some of the demands may not be as attainable as community leaders hope.  We don't have a very big agenda,  said Gbenekama, the Gbaramatu kingdom chief.  The general agenda of the Niger Delta people is the political and fiscal restructuring of this nation.

The French government has committed to stick to plans to cut the deficit to 3 percent of economic output this year despite overspending this year by its predecessor.  One of the constraints facing the government is to keep its commitments on the budget and in particular on the three percent. This is something that we welcome in part because of the consequences for the rest of Europe,  Coeure said. Speaking at an economics conference in southern France, Coeure said that France's respect for the rules would help discussions the government hopes to launch soon about common budget measures in the euro zone.  You can't tell others what to do if you don't respect the rules yourself,  Coeure said. Speaking at the same conference, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that the government could cut spending and taxes at the same time.   It's because the ECB's monetary policy is accommodative that we must without delay launch the transformation of our  economy,  Le Maire said.

He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in the city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer.

While a degree of risk always exists in the movement of any patient, both physicians believe Mr Liu can be safely transported with appropriate medical evacuation care and support. However, the medical evacuation would have to take place as quickly as possible.  The doctors acknowledged the quality of care he has received and said they agreed with the diagnosis of primary liver cancer.

Sydney-born Konta is four wins away from becoming the first British player to win the Wimbledon women's title since Virginia Wade in 1977. Just to ramp up the pressure she will also enter the second week wearing the favorites' tag. Belgian Fissette, however, says Konta's ability to play with intuition and not hit the panic button when things go wrong gives her a great chance of winning a first major.  I give her lots of messages the day before a match and she goes over them with me again before she goes on court, just to make sure it's all clear,  Fissette, who has worked with Kim Clijsters, Simona Halep and Victoria Azarenka, told Reuters.  But I don't give her too much information. I've had players who are extremely rational and open for statistics.  Johanna goes more on the feeling. I provide tactics and key points about the match but she follows her intuition a lot and plays freely, which is good because it's only her on court.  I remember Kim (Clijsters) was very much a player like that. She didn't do better with more info. Actually the more free she was to make decisions the better she did,  he added of the former world number one and four-time grand slam winner. Next Hurdle Konta has been impressive so far and came through an intense and high-quality battle with Donna Vekic in the second round. Dangerous Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia is the next hurdle in the last 16, a player with a fine grasscourt pedigree, but Fissette believes his opposite number, Garcia's father and coach Louis, will have a tough time figuring out a way to stop Konta.  I remember when I was with Vika (Azarenka) and she played Johanna in Wuhan and I was trying to analyze Johanna's game before the match and I found it difficult,  he said. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 9, 2017   Great Britain's Johanna Konta walks off court after a practice sessionTony O'Brien She doesn't really have a weakness and can score from both sides. It was difficult to find a good game plan to beat her.  Should sixth seed Konta beat Garcia, waiting in the quarter-finals will be either Azarenka or Halep -- so inside information will not be in short supply.  It would be an advantage sure,  said 37-year-old Fissette, who guided Konta to the Miami title this year -- her biggest yet.  But to be honest I know when Johanna is playing well she is very tough to beat.  The good thing is she is very clear about what she needs to do on every ball. She trusts herself fully.  Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 9, 2017   Great Britain's Johanna Konta walks off court after a practice sessionTony O'BrienDay Off Konta, 26, took the day off on Saturday to get away from the Wimbledon bubble, Fissette said.  That was her idea, not mine,  he said.  She is dealing with the expectation very well. She is taking it all in her stride. She is calm and just focusing on the next day.  Fissette believes Konta's serve could be the key to her chances of emulating Wade. She is currently winning 78 percent of her first serve points, behind only Americans Venus Williams and Coco Vandeweghe of the last 16 survivors.  Her serve is massive weapon,  Fissette said.  You don't see many girls with a serve like that. For sure it's in the top three in the servers for women.  It's not just her first serve. I think a lot of players would like to have a first serve as good as Johanna's second serve. She trusts it.  Konta's rise has given British tennis a two-pronged attack at Wimbledon this year, rather than just relying on Andy Murray, and Fissette says Konta is thriving in the spotlight.  Garcia will be a tough match, but Johanna can use the energy of the crowd. She has definitely a big chance to win a grand slam. I thought that when I began working with her and nothing has made me change my mind.

Desjardins, the largest association of credit unions in North America, on Friday temporarily suspended lending for such projects and may make the decision permanent, spokesman Jacques Bouchard told Reuters by telephone. He said the lender would make a final decision in September. Dejardins, a backer of Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd's high-profile expansion of its Trans Mountain pipeline, has been evaluating its policy for such lending for months, Bouchard said. If it makes the decision permanent, that would likely mean Desjardins would not help finance other major Canadian pipelines projects, including TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL and Energy East and Enbridge Inc's Line 3. Such a move would follow that of Dutch lender ING Groep NV , which has a long-standing policy of not funding projects directly related to oil sands, and is the latest sign that pipelines could have a harder time getting funding as banks face increasing pressure to back away. Patrick Bonin, a campaigner with the environmental group Greenpeace, praised Desjardins for temporarily halting pipeline funding, but called on the lender to make it permanent and reconsider its C$145 million ($113 million) commitment to Trans Mountain. Desjardins is among 24 financial institutions that agreed to lend money to a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Canada, majority owned by Kinder Morgan Inc of Houston, according to regulatory filings. A coalition of more than 20 indigenous and environmental groups, including Greenpeace, in June called on 28 major banks to pull funding for Trans Mountain, citing the risk of pipeline spills and their potential contribution to climate change. ING, which was targeted by the coalition, clarified it will not fund any of the major Canadian pipelines. The same month, Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, sold investments in six companies that it says violate the Paris climate agreement, including TransCanada, in a decision environmentalists believe is the first of its kind.

Renzi said he would keep the national deficit at 2.9 percent, just a notch under a EU ceiling of 3 percent, but would use an estimated 30 billion euros to cut taxes and push growth, in excerpts of a new book which were released by daily Il Sole 24 Ore on Sunday.  The 42-year old resigned as prime minister in December after a crushing defeat in a national referendum over constitutional reforms aimed at streamlining the country's lawmaking process.  He was replaced by his foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, but kept his position as head of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) and has been working on a political comeback since stepping down.  A strong agreement in which Italy commits to reducing its debt to GDP ratio through stronger growth.... in exchange for a return for at least five years... with deficit at 2.9 percent,  he wrote, adding this would be the PD's agenda for the next general election, due by May 2018.   Italy has an official 2017 target of bringing the deficit down to 2.1 percent of GDP, from 2.4 percent in 2016. But the European Commission says Italy needs faster deficit reduction to bring down its overall debt pile which is the highest in the euro zone after Greece's.     I do not accept that Italy is treated like an undisciplined scholar that must be told to behave. This is an attitude that hurts Europe... which becomes an unpleasant watchman,  Renzi writes.    Italy's economy has been the most sluggish in the euro zone for more than a decade, and the government's 1.1 percent growth forecast for this year would be only about half the average expected for the region as a whole.   Renzi's PD party fared badly in local elections last month, but polls show his party is still one of Italy's most popular nationally, just behind the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.  But with internal party rifts and Renzi's confrontational style, there is no guarantee that he would be named prime minister of a future coalition government even if the PD were to win the most votes during the election.

If people did this in Egypt they would be shot,  said Ibrahim Ali, a 29-year-old Egyptian who came here in 2011.  The state provides everything: housing, unemployment benefits and education. Yet those people are not happy. I don't get it.  Ali and two more refugees from Syria and Egypt were serving beer, falafel, hummus, tabouleh salad and other Middle Eastern delights to protesters who had started leaving the Sternschanze quarter as police special units moved in against the rioters.  They are crazy. I can't believe my eyes,  said Mohammad Halabi, 32, a Syrian who arrived in Germany as a refugee some 18 months ago.  They have such a beautiful country and they're destroying it.  Halabi, who speaks broken German, said he had been following the G20 only to see if world leaders would come up with a solution to end the civil war in Syria. His expectation were low, he said, so he was not disappointed when he read on social media on Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin had agreed on a ceasefire for southwestern Syria.  It's a joke. They are not serious,  said Halabi.  They are simply interested in preserving their own interests in Syria and the Middle East.  'Not Scared' German riot police officers walk in front of protesters during demonstrations at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, July 8, 2017.Fabian BimmerWhen he was not serving falafel, Halabi ran toward the square where rioters had set barricades on fire, and took pictures of police firing water cannon.  This is nothing. I'm not scared,  he said, sharing pictures with family members living in Turkey.  Bombs falling on your neighborhood, that's scary.  Hours after police wrestled back control of Sternschanze, a traditional venue for leftist protests, residents and shopkeepers came out to inspect the extent of the damage. Some helped municipal workers who had been cleaning the streets since dusk, removing glass, concrete slabs and stones that had been hurled at police. All said they were angry at Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to hold the summit in their port city as they had feared that militant members of the Black Bloc anarchist group would resort to violence.  It's scary what happened here,  said teacher Sandra Janowitz, 28.  But I don't blame the demonstrators. Most were teenagers who don't know what they're doing. And many were foreigners. They went home and we have to deal with this mess.  Merkel on Saturday defended her decision to hold the summit in the city of her birth, praised the police's security operation and said that residents would receive compensation. Unlike native Hamburg residents, Halabi said he cannot be angry at Merkel.  Without her I wouldn't be here,  he said, referring to the chancellor's decision to welcome refugees.

In the late evening, after leaders had left Hamburg, police turned on water cannon to disperse remaining protestors, many drunk, who started throwing bottles and other objects. Emergency services said they were treating injured people but gave no numbers. Tensions had been high all day after riots on Friday night when radicals looted shops, torched cars and hurled objects. The city centre was in lock down with luxury shops along the main streets barricaded up and many protected by security guards. More than 50,000 people gathered for a  G20 - not welcome  demonstration in the port city in the afternoon. At one point a group of about 120 people, some masked, kicked police and attacked them with flagpoles before running away.  Chancellor Angela Merkel, facing an election in September, had sought to underscore her commitment to free speech by holding the summit in central Hamburg, a trading hub with a long tradition of leftist radicalism. Images of smoke rising over parts of the city, burning cars, wrecked shops and streets awash with debris have, however, raised questions about her strategy, and police reinforcements from across Germany had to be dispatched to help.

The message is G20 - never again and certainly not in Hamburg,  Oskar Zach, 16, told Reuters.  We aim to remain peaceful. We want to show we can demonstrate without violence.   ATTAC coordinator Thomas Eberhardt-Koester said the movement wanted to  bring our criticism of the G20 and our alternatives for fair global policies onto the streets .  In the last three days, more than 200 police officers have been injured. Some 143 people have been arrested and 122 taken into custody.

Ministers decried the violent protestors and said they would face the full force of the law.  These are not demonstrators, they are criminals,  said Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere. But some other politicians criticized the choice of venue.  We should ask whether the state, with its monopoly of the right to uphold security and order, was well advised to choose Hamburg,  Hans-Peter Uhl, a senior member of Bavaria's CSU conservatives, sister party of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) told Handelsblatt business daily. Merkel defended her choice of Hamburg, saying similar summits had been held in big cities such as London and it was unacceptable to say some places were ruled out as venues. Hamburg residents, who Merkel said would receive compensation for damage, were also angry at the destruction.  Merkel underestimated the protests. The least she can do now is come visit (the district of) Sternschanze and see the damage for herself,  said Kai Mertens, a 50-year-old programmer.

We're prepared to make some short-term sacrifices for the long-term gain of the sport,  Brown told reporters at the Austrian Grand Prix.  While I don't think we need to go to a flat revenue structure, clearly it is too out of balance compared to other sports and that's why we have this out of balance race results.  Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull are the only teams to have won Formula One races since Lotus triumphed in Australia in March 2013. Brown said he aimed to  put Formula One first and McLaren a really close second , and smiled when asked whether all the other teams shared his view:  I doubt it.  Ferrari, champions Mercedes, McLaren and Red Bull currently receive special annual payments to reflect past success and their importance to the sport. Williams also get a smaller 'heritage' payment. Ferrari, the only team to have been in the championship since it started in 1950 and the most successful, get a special long-standing bonus of around $68 million. McLaren, still the sport's second most successful team despite not having won a race since 2012, finished sixth overall in 2016. However, projected figures published by autosport.com in May showed they stand to be paid $97 million in 2017 compared to the $72 million that Force India will receive for finishing fourth. That still pales in comparison to the $180 million paid to Ferrari and $171 million going to champions Mercedes. At the end of the scale, newcomers Haas will get only $19 million, according to Autosport. Formula One's underlying revenues are estimated at $1.38 billion, with the teams sharing roughly 68 percent.  This is a time where I think we need to work together to grow the sport,  said Brown, whose Honda-powered team are last in the current standings and have Bahrain's holding company Mumtalakat as a major shareholder.  I’ve been asked questions on 'do you think you get the right slice of the pie?’ 68 percent now. Of course I’d love us to have 75 and I’m sure (F1 owners) Liberty would love to have maybe 55.  I think the percentage is less relevant if we can double, triple our group or the size of the pool.  Liberty Media, who completed their takeover of Formula One in January, have said they want to rebalance revenue payments once commercial agreements with teams expire in 2020.  We've got tracks going bust, we have teams going bust and then some people getting really rich. The poor guys need to at least be able to make a living,  said Brown.  We need to get that water pipe up to where at least if you are at the back of the grid you can make a living and your franchise is worth something and you have the opportunity to move forward.  I think it would be great to have an underdog team win a couple of times a year.

Aside from Mosul, across the border in Syria a battle is raging to dislodge IS from Raqqa, the second capital of its self-declared caliphate. Fighting will push down the Euphrates valley to Deir al-Zour, the jihadis’ last big urban stronghold. But the fall of Mosul also exposes ethnic and sectarian fractures that have plagued Iraq for more than a decade. The victory risks triggering new violence between Arabs and Kurds over disputed territories or between Sunnis and Shi’ites over claims to power, egged on by outside powers that have shaped Iraq’s future since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein’s Sunni minority-rule and brought the Iran-backed Shi’ite majority to power. For Iraq, stunned by the blitz on Mosul by Islamic State in 2014 and the collapse of its army, victory could thus turn out to be as big a problem as defeat. The federal model devised under the Anglo-American occupation and built on a power-sharing agreement between Sunnis, Shi’ites and Kurds collapsed into ethno-sectarian carnage spawned by the al Qaeda precursors of Islamic State. In the three years since the jihadis swept across the border from Syria where they had regrouped in the chaos of the rebellion against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s rule, IS was the rallying point uniting a fractured Iraq. But now that the group faces military defeat, the unity that held Iraq together is starting to come apart. No Post-Battle Plan One challenge is the future of Mosul itself, a city traumatised by Islamic State's brutal rule and shattered by the latest U.S.-backed offensive, with thousands dead and nearly one million people displaced. Western, Iraqi and Kurdish officials say they are astonished that Iraqi authorities neglected to prepare a post-battle plan for governance and security. A high-level committee formed by the Kurdish region, the Baghdad government and a U.S.-led military coalition to help Mosul leaders rebuild the city had never convened, they said.  Prime Minister (Haider) al-Abadi kept dragging his heels. Every time we raised this issue with him, he said, 'Let’s wait until military operations are over',  said Hoshyar Zebari, an internationally respected former finance and foreign minister.  A whole city is being decimated. Look how much the government is contributing, as if they don’t care.  The first indication of possible future conflict came when Masoud Barzani, president of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region, announced a Sept. 25 referendum for an independent state. Another omen was a push by Iran-backed Shi'ite militias, grouped under the government-run Hashid Shaabi, to deploy alongside Kurdish areas and advance towards the Syrian border, motivated by Iran's desire to join Iraq and Syria and establish a corridor from Tehran to Beirut.  Today the highway of resistance starts in Tehran and reaches Mosul, Damascus and Beirut,  Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader, said last week. Jihadi Fighters All this comes against a backdrop of simmering rivalries between regional powers Iran and Turkey, and above all declining U.S. influence and Iran’s vigorous attempts to consolidate its control in Iraq. While the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump regards Syria and Iraq purely in terms of the military campaign to destroy IS, local jihadi fighters will simply melt back into the population, and could regroup in a new insurgency. Sunni and Kurdish leaders in and around Mosul largely agree with this grim prognosis, alarmed that Abadi has refused even to discuss the future governance of Mosul, and suspecting that Iran is calling the shots. The disputed territories stretch along an ethnically mixed ribbon of land dividing the autonomous Kurdish area in the north of Iraq from the Arab-majority part in the south - more a minefield than a mosaic - at a time when both the Kurds and Sunni Arabs are giving up on Shi’ite rule in Baghdad. Atheel al-Nujaifi, who was Nineveh governor when the provincial capital Mosul was captured in 2014, says: “We are back to where we were before Mosul fell, (because) there is an idea among the hardline Shi’ite leadership to keep the liberated areas as loose areas, with no (local) political leadership, or security organisations, so they can control them”. Moderate Shi’ite leaders, among whom he counts Abadi, are wary of a winner-take-all logic of victory, fearing this “could lead to the creation of radicalism again and they know this would destroy not only Iraq but the Shi’ites”. The problem, he believes, is that Iraqi Shi’ism is badly fractured, helping Iran control almost all its factions. The former governor, a Sunni who now has at his command an armed force trained by Turkey, says he is bowing out of office but not politics. He acknowledges there is a lack of mainstream Sunni leaders, but blames Baghdad for making sure none emerges. Whither the Sunnis? Talk of Kurdish secession has sparked discussion of whether Sunni Arabs should set up a separate state, though most officials say this is not practical, because: Sunni territory lacks the oil base the Shi’ites and Kurds have; the experience of Islamic State would hover like a spectre over any new entity; and Sunnis are too intermingled across Iraq. Some Sunni and Kurdish leaders believe one solution is to make Mosul a self-governing region like Kurdistan, with smaller units of self-rule to accommodate the plethora of minorities, which they say is permitted by the constitution. “Before, the Sunnis were very sensitive to believing (devolution) would lead to secession, to the breakup of Iraq but now they’re coming to terms with it,” says Zebari. The Sunnis are not the only ones who repudiate Baghdad's Shi’ite-dominated government. The northern Kurdish region has called a referendum to move from autonomous self-rule to an independent state. Kurdish leader Barzani told Reuters timing for independence after the vote was “flexible but not open-ended”. Yet there is growing concern the real purpose of the referendum is not immediate secession, but to strengthen Kurdish claims over the disputed territories, such as the oil-rich region and city of Kirkuk, whose future has been in play for over a decade.  We Lost Hope and Faith  Zebari, a senior official in Barzani’s Kurdish Democratic Party who devoted over a decade in Baghdad trying to make power-sharing work, said the time was ripe for independence. “We lost hope and faith in the new Iraq that we had built. The government has failed us on each and every constitutional provision and article to establish a new country with equal citizenship, with no discrimination, with partnership. All those dreams have evaporated,” he told Reuters. The problem, he says, is that senior Iranian officials have left no doubt their priority – a corridor for Shi’ite forces carved through the north and policed by Shi'ite recruits – trumps everything else.  They are breathing down our neck all along the Kurdish frontline from Sinjar to Khanaqin,  he said.  So far we have been accommodating, patient, coordinating to prevent skirmishes or flashes but this is building up.

Trump campaigned in last year's presidential election on cracking down on China for its trade practices, but he softened his rhetoric after taking office, saying he wanted to work with China on the nuclear issue. When the two leaders first met in April at Trump's Florida resort, they appeared to hit it off. Trump called Xi a  good man  as he urged him to use Beijing's economic clout to force North Korea to curb its nuclear weapons program. Lately, Trump has expressed some impatience on China's role in North Korea - particularly after Pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe could have the range to reach Alaska, and parts of the U.S. West Coast. His administration made new arms sales to Taiwan, imposed sanctions on two Chinese citizens and a shipping company and put China on a global human trafficking list. It also accused a Chinese bank of laundering money for Pyongyang. The White House is also debating trade actions against Beijing, including tariffs on its steel exports and a few days before the G20 talks, Trump complained that trade between China and North Korea had grown.  But he showed none of that impatience on Saturday, when the leaders met at the invitation of Xi at the tail end of the G20 in Germany.  It's an honor to have you as a friend,  Trump told Xi, telling him he appreciated actions he had already taken on North Korea.

It may take longer than I'd like. It may take longer than you'd like. But there will be success in the end one way or the other,  Trump said. Speaking to reporters later on Air Force One, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump-Xi meeting lasted over an hour-and-a-half, and they had  substantive discussions  about how to deal with North Korea together.  In regards to China, we had very direct discussions about North Korea. We had very direct discussions about military and security cooperation,  Mnuchin said.    I think that President Trump made very clear to President Xi that he is focused on this issue, and wants to move forward and make progress.

Xi stressed the importance of talks with North Korea, and said China's navy will join next year's U.S.-led Pacific Rim military exercises. Xinhua said Xi stressed to Trump China's position that it adheres to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and maintaining peace and stability there. Slideshow (2 Images)While China has been angered by North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile tests, it also blames the United States and South Korea for worsening tension with their military exercises.  China has many times talked about its principled position, namely that at the same time as the international community making necessary responses to North Korean acts that go against U.N. Security Council resolutions, they must step up efforts to promote talks and manage and control the situation,  Xinhua said, citing Xi. Xi also reiterated China's opposition to the U.S. deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, Xinhua said. China says THAAD threatens its security, despite U.S. and South Korean assurances it is aimed only at defending against North Korea. Both leaders agreed to maintain close communication and coordination on the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, Xinhua said. In a statement released on Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Xi and Trump had  enhanced mutual understanding  about the North Korea issue and  confirmed the broad direction of using peaceful means to resolve this issue . Trump also mentioned trade imbalances in his meeting with Xi, calling it a  very, very big issue  that he would address.  I know that China in particular, which is a great trading partner, we will be able to do something that will be equitable and reciprocal,  Trump said. Senior officials from both countries will meet in Washington on July 19 to discuss economic and trade issues.

But while that has taken a lot of lawyers who previously could represent people seeking redress from the Communist Party system out of circulation, it is not preventing activists from communicating, and in particular seeking to lobby foreign governments to take a stance against rights abuses in China, activists and diplomats say. On July 9, 2015, the authorities launched what rights groups say was a coordinated attempt to quash China's rights movement, in what is known as the “709” crackdown because of the date of the event. The core members of the movement were described by the official paper of the ruling Communist Party, the People's Daily, as  a major criminal gang that has seriously damaged social order.  Two years on, most of the detained have been sentenced and are in prison or under house arrest; many made public confessions and were sentenced in what their families say were either secret or scripted trials. They weren’t allowed independent representation and were defended by government-appointed lawyers. Other activists and lawyers were picked up in the months before and after that date. Beijing's campaign did not spell the end of rights activism in China, according to Western diplomats, who say their embassies are meeting activists on an almost daily basis. They did, though, say that the campaign has pushed activism further outside the system, limiting avenues of redress within China's courts, and leaving international pressure as a main focus for the activists. The government has made reforms to professionalize the legal system and improve the average person’s ability to settle disputes in court, but the party has rejected a separation of powers in China and few lawyers work to actively find and defend people who are alleging there have been abuses of government power, as rights lawyers do.  They burned the field but the roots remain and new shoots are constantly appearing,  one Western diplomat said, declining to be named. Feng Chongyi, an Australia-based expert on China's rights activists at the University of Technology Sydney, said that President Xi Jinping had aimed to  eliminate  the rights lawyers and other forms of organized resistance with the crackdown. Feng was himself prevented from leaving China for a week in March and was subjected to daily interrogations during that time. Those detained did get financial and moral support from other lawyers, said Feng, who is an Australian permanent resident with a Chinese passport. China has rejected international criticism of the crackdown and defends its detention and persecution of rights lawyers saying that they are criminals who pose a threat to China’s national security and social order. The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a fax seeking comment on the crackdown. Li Wenzu, wife of lawyer Wang Quanzhang, who was detained in what is known as the  709  crackdown, joins others protesting in front of the Supreme People's Procuratorate in Beijing, China July 7, 2017.Damir SagoljFather Fighting for Son Born three months before the founding of the People's Republic of China, Xu Xiaoshun did not choose to become an activist, but when the authorities detained his son in the summer of 2015, the then 66-year-old decided he had little choice.  When he first got started, I said to him: 'If you really want to work defending rights, then when you are locked up, I will come save you',  Xu told Reuters, speaking of his son, Wu Gan, an online blogger and activist.  Xu has not seen his son since he was detained in May 2015 – two months before the big crackdown, Wu, who is better known by his screen-name  Super Vulgar Butcher,  was later charged with  subversion of state power . His trial date has not been announced. Slideshow (9 Images)Xu is one of many family members, friends and colleagues of those detained in recent years who have taken up activism in response to Beijing's hardline campaign. Shortly after detaining his son, the authorities also came for Xu.  A month after Wu Gan was locked up, I was approached by the local police and asked to write a letter saying that Wu Gan was guilty,  Xu said.  'He's not guilty,' I told them. 'Guilty or not you should still write it,  they told me. When I refused they detained me, too,  he recounts.   The authorities held Xu for 19 months on fraud charges before a court found him innocent and released him. Xu says the case against him was fabricated. Reuters was unable to independently verify Xu's claims. The Public Security Bureau did not respond to a request for comment on the matter. Since his release, Xu has spent most of his time on the road, meeting with diplomats, activists and the family members in similar cases, as well as friends of his son. He also uses encrypted messaging applications. Xi has differed from other recent Chinese leaders in making repression of rights activism much more public, according to Eva Pils, an expert on civil society in China at King's College London. The repression can scare some people but with others it can lead to radicalisation, Pils said:  What was once seen as purely legal advocacy has become political rights advocacy,” she adds.

Voting was set to finish across the country on Saturday, but with a large number of people unable to cast ballots due to out-of-date electoral rolls and logistical problems, ballot boxes were still open in some provinces on Sunday. Tension in PNG has been high for months amid a groundswell of unrest following allegations of corruption against Prime Minister Peter O'Neill. The frustration among voters unable to cast ballots could trigger new unrest, analysts said.  There's always some degree of violence and malfeasance in a PNG election, however no one expected the electoral roll to be this bad,  Jonathan Pryke, director of the Lowy Institute of Policy's Melanesia Unit, told Reuters. In June 2016, a student protest turned violent when police opened fire, injuring dozens. International observers said the use of an electoral roll from 2012 polls meant many people, in highland regions in particular, were denied the chance to vote. Sam Basil, leader of the junior opposition Pangu Party, told Reuters 9,000 voters in his constituency of Bulolo, on the north coast of the main island, had been unable to cast ballots because of irregularities. He said polling was expected to finish across PNG on Monday.     Observers expect a tight race between O'Neil's party and that of his main rival, former Treasurer Patrick Pruaitch. Whoever wins faces a difficult economic outlook with a budget deficit that has ballooned in recent years amid a slump in oil and gas prices. A 2016 drought crippled farming and brought production at its largest copper mine to a halt by cutting off river transport and therefore fuel supplies. Moody's downgraded PNG's credit rating to B2 in April last year, reflecting balance of payments pressures that have been compounded by the slump in global commodity prices. Despite its mineral wealth, which includes Exxon Mobil's $20 billion LNG plant, most of the country's nearly eight million people live at subsistence level on islands, atolls and in remote mountain village.

Castillo was overpowering at times while pitching 6 2/3 shutout innings for his first career victory and Joey Votto hit a three-run homer in the first inning to carry the Cincinnati Reds past the Arizona Diamondbacks 7-0 on Saturday night. Castillo (1-1) was in command throughout, touching 100 mph with his fastball several times during his fourth career start. He struck out eight, walked one and gave up only one hit until the seventh inning, when he was lifted after allowing two singles.  You couldn't ask for more than that -- that was a great performance,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  He had a nice mix, he really did. (He) was able to bring in the changeup and the breaking ball but threw the fastball with confidence, sitting there at 97 to 100, and blending in the others when needed.  Votto knew how well Castillo was pitching from the reaction he saw from the Diamondbacks' frustrated hitters:  Guys are getting awkward swings and don't seem comfortable up there.   I was very impressed with his composure and his presence,  Price said of the 24-year-old Castillo.  More than anything, he exudes confidence out there. From everything I pick up when I go to the mound, the infielders love playing behind this guy. They love seeing him get after it, pound the zone. He's confident and he trusts his stuff, and the team loves playing behind him.  Five of the Reds' seven hits went for extra bases. Scooter Gennett and Tucker Barnhart also homered, and Barnhart doubled and scored on Billy Hamilton's single in the fourth inning. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at DiamondbacksCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchHamilton reached base four times with two walks and both Reds' singles and stole second three times. The right-handed Castillo, acquired from Miami last winter in the Dan Straily trade, was never in trouble until Jake Lamb and Ketel Marte singled two batters apart in the seventh. Castillo then left after throwing 113 pitches, with Wandy Peralta coming on to get pinch hitter A.J. Pollock to pop out with two on and two out.  You're always wondering as a professional pitcher what is going to be your first win and today was it, and I'm real happy,  Castillo said through an interpreter.  I tried to get ahead with my fastball and I had really good feel for my changeup and it worked out really well for me.  Peralta also pitched the eighth before Ariel Hernandez worked the ninth to finish off the three-hit shutout. Castillo faced a lineup that didn't include two of Arizona's best hitters, David Peralta and Pollock, though Pollock entered later in the game after pinch hitting. Manager Torey Lovullo defended his lineup, saying he needs to keep players rested for the August and September stretch drive.  Whether we win or lose, these guys are always prepared,  Lovullo said. Diamondbacks starter Taijuan Walker (6-4) gave up five runs and five hits in five innings and surrendered multiple homers in a game for the first time this season. Arizona lost for the fourth time in five games and seventh in 10 games to fall 6 1/2 games behind Los Angeles in the National League West. The Reds needed only three batters to take a 3-0 lead against Walker, who allowed only one run in seven innings in his previous start on July 1 against Colorado. Hamilton walked and immediately stole second -- a pattern he was to repeat -- before All-Star shortstop Zack Cozart scored him with a triple to right-center field. Votto, en route to his fifth All-Star Game but first since 2013, then hit an opposite-field homer to left field on an 0-1 fastball that Walker left up in the strike zone. Votto's homer was his National League-leading 26th, three shy of the 29 he hit last season. The Reds, who came in 18-34 in their previous 52 games, made it 4-0 before the Diamondbacks got their first hit against Castillo. Barnhart doubled with one out in the fourth and scored on Hamilton's two-out single to left. Hamilton then stole second for his 37th of the season and third in as many innings. Hamilton also walked and stole second in the second but was stranded when Cozart grounded out. Paul Goldschmidt singled up the middle leading off the fourth for Arizona's first hit, but Castillo promptly retired the next three batters. Gennett hit the Reds' second homer of the game and the seventh this season off Walker with one out in the fifth, a solo shot that was his 15th and his third during a seven-game hitting streak. NOTES: Reds RHP Luis Castillo has struck out 25 in 18 innings in his last three starts. ...

It was said Oakland's 36-year-old right-hander, who was making his first career start in the major leagues, threw no harder than 86 mph. Don't believe it. Smith's fastball reached 88 mph against the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field.  I saw a couple snowmen,  Smith said, referring to the two 8s.  I hope my wife got a picture of it.  Smith's first start was a quality one -- six innings with three earned runs allowed -- but he didn't factor into the decision as the A's scored in the ninth to win 4-3, getting the go-ahead run on Ryon Healy's two-out, ground-rule RBI double.  That was goal, six innings with three runs,  Smith said.  To do that in the big leagues ... that's a personal pat on the back.  Rajai Davis led off the ninth with an infield single against Seattle closer Edwin Diaz and stole second. With two outs, All-Star Yonder Alonso was walked intentionally. Diaz got ahead in the count 0-2 to Healy, but Diaz then hung a slider that Healy hit into the gap in right-center field. The ball bounced over the wall for a ground-rule double, scoring the go-ahead run.  Oh-and-two count, he made a mistake. Left it right in the middle of the plate,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  In this league to middle-lineup guys, they're going to make you pay. Related CoveragePreview: Athletics at MarinersOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch Sometimes a tie game in the ninth inning comes down to one pitch.  A's closer Santiago Casilla allowed a two-out double in the bottom of the ninth to Mitch Haniger but got Jarrod Dyson to fly out to left field to end the game and secure his 15th save of the season. The Oakland bullpen pitched three scoreless innings in relief of Smith, with Sean Doolittle (1-0) getting the victory. Smith, who had made 63 relief appearances since breaking in with the Boston Red Sox in 2008, allowed six hits, walked one and struck out four. He left with the score tied 3-3.  I thought he pitched great,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  I mean, that's not the easiest of lineups. ... He did every bit of his job and probably a little more. It was fun to see.  He was bouncing around here a little bit, but there had to have been some nerves and a lot of excitement, and which was more I'm not 100 percent sure, but once got on the mound he did his thing like he did in Triple-A this year.  Smith held Robinson Cano and Nelson Cruz, American League All-Stars and the Nos. 3-4 hitters in the Seattle lineup, hitless in six at-bats.  I paid attention to those guys. They're on ESPN and in the All-Star Game,  Smith said.  I made pitches to them that looked like strikes but ended up balls.  What pitches were working best for Smith?  I was throwing a fastball down the middle and when I did, they didn't hurt me ... except Dyson,  Smith said. Dyson's solo homer leading off the fifth inning tied the score at 3-3 and prevented Smith from perhaps earning the victory. He didn't seem to mind.  I got to enjoy it,  he said.  I might be one-and-done.  Mariners rookie right-hander Andrew Moore, making his third career start, matched Smith. Moore also allowed three runs and six hits in six innings, though he walked two and struck out two. The Athletics took the lead in the second as Healy led off with a single, moved to second an out later on a Bruce Maxwell single and scored on a two-out single by Jaycob Brugman. Oakland extended the lead to 2-0 in the third on Alonso's solo home run with two outs. Alonso hit a 1-1 pitch from Moore 410 feet into the right-field seats for his 20th home run of the season. Yet pretty much all Alonso wanted talk about after the game was Smith.  He did a good job being himself,  Alonso said.  You're looking at a guy having so much fun and enjoying every moment. He pitched quick and threw strikes and got ground balls, too.  The Mariners tied the score in the bottom of the third when Dyson led off with a double and scored on Jean Segura's one-out double. Ben Gamel followed with a run-scoring single to center to make it 2-2. Marcus Semien gave the A's a 3-2 lead in the fifth on a solo homer with one out, his first home run of the season. Semien hit a 2-1 pitch from Moore that just eluded the reach of Gamel in left and bounced off top of the fence and over the wall. Dyson tied it by leading off the bottom of the inning with his fifth homer of the season. NOTES: The Mariners dropped to 1-9 in their past 10 games at home. ... The A's made a series of roster moves. They selected RHP Chris Smith's contract from Triple-A Nashville; reinstated C Josh Phegley from the paternity list; optioned INF Franklin Barreto, the organization's top prospect, to Nashville; and designated C Ryan Lavarnway for assignment. ...

They watched him hit a garbage-time home run in a 12-4 loss Friday night and savored something even more memorable Saturday night when Anderson led off the ninth against Greg Holland, the major league saves leader this season. Anderson fell into a 1-2 hole and then drove Holland's fastball over the wall in center field for a home run that gave the White Sox a 5-4 victory over the Colorado Rockies.  I never got off the heater,  said Anderson, who hit his ninth homer.  I had a feeling he was going to try to challenge me with a heater in, because they'd kind of been coming in all game.  After the Rockies scored a run in the eighth to tie the game, Holland (1-1) took the mound with a 1.39 ERA in 34 games. He had allowed 17 hits in 32 1/3 innings. Opponents had batted .156 against Holland with just one home run. That was by St. Louis' Paul DeJong on May 28 in his first major league at-bat in a game where Holland took the mound with a five-run lead and was just getting work. The stakes were significantly higher when Anderson connected and sent the Rockies to their 13th loss in 17 games. Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at RockiesChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatch I think on my part it was just a mental lapse,  Holland said.  I didn't really have great command on my fastball, and I just thought maybe I could catch him looking. I was trying to go down and away, and I missed in the middle of the plate.  It's easier to deal with when you just get beat, but when you feel like you completely goofed, it's a different story. I threw a pitch in the middle of the plate ahead in the count in a tie ball game I didn't deserve to get out of there without a run, and it unfortunately cost us tonight.  While striking out two of the three batters he faced in the ninth to earn his 13th save, White Sox closer David Robertson threw a called third strike past Charlie Blackmon for the second out. An irate Blackmon argued with home plate umpire Sam Holbrook and was ejected. Rockies manager Bud Black was also tossed when he came out to defend Blackmon. Robertson then struck out pinch hitter Carlos Gonzalez to end the game. Mark Reynolds led off the eighth with a triple against former Rockies pitcher Tommy Kahnle (1-3). Right fielder Alen Hanson leaped unsuccessfully at the wall and the ball came bounding back toward the infield, far enough for Reynolds to easily reach third with his first triple of the season. Gerardo Parra followed with a sacrifice fly that tied the game at 4. With two outs, Raimel Tapia's checked swing resulted in a slow roller to third baseman Todd Frazier, who had no play on the speedy Tapia. Tapia reached second on Kahnle's wild pitch, but Kahnle got Tony Wolters to ground out. Rockies starter Jeff Hoffman worked a career-high seven innings for the second straight outing and fourth time in 10 starts this season. He allowed four runs and seven hits with two walks and two strikeouts. Hoffman faced only one batter with a runner in scoring position after the first. That was White Sox starter Jose Quintana, who netted his first career RBI with a sacrifice fly after Willy Garcia's one-out triple in the fifth to give Chicago a 4-2 lead.  Jeff hung in there,  Black said.  He wasn't at his best, but I really like how he hung in there and went seven innings without his best stuff and best command.  Quintana issued his only two walks of the game in the sixth and paid for it when Parra doubled home a run. That hit cut the White Sox's lead to 4-3 and finished Quintana after 5 1/3 innings and 103 pitches. He gave up three runs and five hits while striking out a season-high-tying 10 (nine swinging). Trade talk has swirled around Quintana, because of his ability and his contract -- he's under control from 2018-2020 for a total of $29.35 million.  I know that the trade (talk) is around me, but that's part of the game,  Quintana said.  I don't have control over that. Just try to throw the ball well and focus for my team.  Asked if he would like to remain with the White Sox, Quintana said,  Absolutely. I want to stay here.  Anthony Swarzak, who pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings, relieved Quintana and threw a called third strike past Trevor Story. Swarzak intentionally walked Tapia to load the bases before retiring Tony Wolters on a grounder to second. The White Sox scored three runs in the first after Hoffman retired the first two batters on seven pitches. After Jose Abreu tripled, Hoffman walked Frazier before Yolmer Sanchez tripled and Kevan Smith lined a single up the middle. The Rockies quickly erased most of that lead in the bottom of the first. Nolan Arenado belted his 17th home run, a two-run shot that scored Blackmon, who opened the inning with a single.

But it was Texas outfielder Drew Robinson's two-run shot in the sixth that helped seal a 5-2 victory for the Rangers over the Los Angeles Angels. Robinson has started for the Rangers twice this season and homered in each start. The win gave the Rangers their first winning streak of at least three games since they won five straight from June 9-13. The Angels have lost five of their last six games and are three games under .500 for the first time since May 13. Texas led 3-1 going into the sixth before Robinson collected his third big-league hit, with all three going for extra bases. He made his first start for the Rangers in left field, where he has just 14 career starts as a professional. Robinson knows his role is to produce when he gets to play and he did Saturday with his homer off reliever Blake Parker. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at RangersLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatch Hopefully I can keep that pace up,  Robinson said.  That was one of those swings when you definitely know something good's going to happen. Then you look up and see the trajectory. It felt good from the start.  The two homers were enough offense for Texas starter Tyson Ross (2-1), who struggled with his command but allowed just one run in 5 2/3 innings. Ross walked two, hit two, threw a wild pitch but only allowed four hits.  I'm feeling pretty good,  said Ross, who has allowed two runs or less in three of his five starts for Texas.  I definitely have some work to do. I look forward to coming out stronger in the second half. Thus far, I've been able to put the team in a decent position in a couple of games. With the rotation we have and the offense, it's a good situation to be pitching in and I'm just trying to do my part.  Los Angeles right-hander Jesse Chavez (5-10) has now lost each of his last three starts and hasn't won a game since June 6. He was charged with three runs on seven hits in five innings. He struck out six and walked two. The Rangers got to Chavez for a run in the first on an RBI double from Nomar Mazara. Los Angeles got the run right back in the top of the second when Yunel Escobar led off the frame with his sixth homer of the year. That would be all the offense for the Angels until Cameron Maybin's RBI grounder with one out in the ninth accounted for the game's final run. The Angels were 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position one night after not having an at-bat in that situation.  The bats weren't bad,  Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia said.  We got a lot of counts in our favor. He (Ross) threw almost as many balls as he did strikes. When push came to shove, we didn't get the key hit with some guys on. Offensively it's been a struggle on this trip. We haven't swung the bats well this week. Consequently, every pitch we make on the mound has possibly more meaning.  Beltre gave the Rangers the lead again in the third. After Elvis Andrus led off the inning with a single, Beltre ripped a two-run homer to left with one out to put the Rangers up 3-1. The homer moved him past Carl Yastrzemski and into sole possession of 38th on the all-time list. Robinson upped the lead two innings later. Andrus and Shin-Soo Choo each had two hits for Texas. Andrelton Simmons had three hits for a Los Angeles team that's scored just four runs in the last three games.  We just didn't capitalize,  Maybin said.  Tyson was effectively kind of all over the place. He made some good pitches when he needed to. We've got to try to do a better job of capitalizing on our opportunities. We had them, and we didn't.  NOTES: The Rangers activated SS Elvis Andrus from the paternity list before the game. He missed two games. To make room for him, the club optioned INF Jurickson Profar to Triple-A Round Rock. ... Texas 1B Joey Gallo was out of the lineup for a second straight game because of soreness in his left hamstring. ... Angels CF Mike Trout went 1-for-2 with a double and a walk in his first rehab appearance in the outfield for Class A Inland Empire. Trout has been out since May 29 with a left ligament thumb injury.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-rangers-writethru-idUSMTZED79T41VA3"},

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * LME Stocks and Price: tmsnrt.rs/2toogSs By Andy Home LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - The zinc funds-fundamentals pendulum has swung again. Back in May funds were beating a collective retreat from the London zinc market after a second failed attempt at the big-number $3,000-per tonne resistance level. The London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month price troughed at $2,427.50 on June 7, since when it has bounced back to a current $2,783.00. Funds have returned with a vengeance, according to LME broker Marex Spectron, which estimates they have gone from net short at the start of June to net long. Indeed at over 20 percent of open interest speculative length is back to levels last seen in January. What's caused this sharp shift in positioning? The short answer is LME stocks. While the headline number continues to tick lower, now down by 146,600, or 34 percent, on the start of the year,  live  on-warrant tonnage has slumped to levels not seen since 2007. There were 109,100 tonnes of net new cancellations over the course of June, leaving on-warrant inventory standing at a depleted 70,350 tonnes. LME time-spreads have tightened accordingly, the benchmark cash-to-three-months period CMZN0-3 trading close to level after being in relatively comfortable $19-per tonne contango just a month ago. Disappearing visible inventory has rekindled zinc's stop-start bull narrative of supply shortfall. Fooled Again? LME inventory levels have been a false friend for zinc's many bull admirers in recent times. Stocks have for years now been highly concentrated in New Orleans, a location that has seen mass movement between on- and off-market storage driven not by physical market but by financing drivers. The most recent manifestation was the appearance of 22,100 tonnes of zinc in LME sheds in New Orleans at the start of May. Since then, however, total inflow into the LME storage system has amounted to just 125 tonnes and that at Port Klang in Malaysia. There are still grounds for caution, particularly in the form of the large short position sitting on the LME's July prime prompt date (July 19). Representing between 30 and 40 percent of open interest <0#LME-FBR>, will it be closed out, rolled or physically delivered? We won't have to wait long to find out, but countering the potential for more smoke and mirrors is a real tightening in the zinc supply chain in the North American market Although it's dropped out of the headlines, the strike at the CEZ refinery in Canada, North America's second-largest producer of refined zinc, is rumbling on into its fifth month. CEZ is majority owned by the Noranda Income Fund but is in essence a tolling plant for Swiss powerhouse Glencore and members of Canada's United Steelworkers union were making their views heard at Glencore's annual meeting on May 24. Noranda Income Fund has been tight-lipped about the impact. Its last official comment in March, one month into the strike, was that it was maintaining production at 50-60 percent of 275,000-tonne per year capacity. First-quarter production, only partly reflecting the impact of the Feb. 12 walk-out, slid to just over 50,000 tonnes from 73,000 tonnes in the previous quarter. Second-quarter results are now pending but the ongoing loss of units is somewhere in the mix at New Orleans, which holds the only LME-registered zinc stocks in the United States. Shanghai Stocks Slump There's more in the mix as well. Everyone's watching China. As the world's largest processor of mined concentrates into refined zinc, the country is on the front-line of the tightening in the raw materials segment of the supply chain. The collective betting is that it is only a matter of time before China's import demand heats up as domestic production fails to keep pace with demand. That hasn't happened yet. Refined zinc imports are running at subdued levels. Despite an acceleration in April and May, the cumulative year-to-date tally is 138,700 tonnes, down 46 percent on last year's levels and 2016 wasn't a bumper import year either. That said, there are signs of stress in China's zinc market. Stocks held in Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) warehouses have, like the LME, been rapidly depleted since the start of the year. Despite a small week-on-week bounce to 66,947 tonnes, the headline figure has fallen by 85,877 tonnes since January. The last time ShFE stocks were this low was all the way back in 2009, when the Shanghai zinc contract was still in its infancy. National refined metal production was down by almost 10 percent in May with several large operators taking maintenance downtime. Zinc concentrate imports have surprised on the upside with inbound flows up 25 percent so far this year. That partly reflects strong imports from Peru (up 40 percent) but also higher imports from second-tier suppliers such as Russia (up 218 percent), Myanmar (up 149 percent) and Iran (up 55 percent). The overall impression is of a smelter sector that is actively thrifting and simultaneously trying to tap new sources of supply. Hoarding physical metal in anticipation of stronger Chinese zinc import demand is the other dimension of the LME stocks picture. Pendulum Swings The zinc pendulum has swung from poor technicals to constructive fundamentals over the space of the last month and the funds are responding by getting back in on the long side. There is still a lot of uncertainty out there as to the real state of play in the physical market and LME stock levels are only one component of the puzzle and an historically unreliable one at that. But at current levels the London zinc market is starting to look like an increasingly tight space, particularly for short-position holders. But there is one in particular, that one sitting on the July date, that merits attention. Its actions will determine the next swing of the funds-fundamentals pendulum.

Positive monsoon data also lifted sentiments. Markets continued to ignore geopolitical tensions due to North Korea’s missile test and the border row between India and China. Macro data also continues to be a cause of concern but liquidity continues to be high. Crude oil prices ended sharply lower by 4 percent for the week on oversupply concerns after Russia opposed deeper supply cuts by OPEC and its partners. The rise in Saudi as well as U.S. crude production added to the woes of oil-producing nations. Meanwhile, minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting suggests that policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how it might affect the future pace of interest rate rises. Expectations are that the Fed may begin shrinking its balance sheet at its September meet. However, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report suggests a “Humpty Dumpty-style fall” - U.S. rate hikes combined with the prospects of the ECB scaling back its stimulus means markets were at a  massive inflection point  in the decade-long easy money trade. Following the implemention of GST, several companies in the auto and FMCG space changed prices to pass on benefits to customers. We could see a near-term impact on margins due to price cuts, though it is positive for the long term as volume growth will see an uptick and drive the topline.  Automobile companies’ June sales trend were mixed ahead of GST implementation – the two-wheeler segment reported a decent yearly volume growth of 5 percent due to wedding season and upbeat rural demand on expectations of normal monsoons. The passenger vehicles segment reported a drop of 8-9 percent due to lower wholesale dispatches.  In stock specific action, Interglobe Aviation was in focus after expressing interest for a stake in Air India after the cabinet gave its approval to privatise the debt-laden carrier. ITC was also in the limelight after the Central Board of Excise and Customs removed excise and additional excise duty on cigarettes. Any price cuts are expected to help volume growth for the company. IDFC, IDFC Bank and Shriram Group stocks were in focus on media reports that they are in talks to combine their businesses that could include traditional banking, consumer lending and truck financing. They have now officially entered into a 90-day merger talk.  The combined entity would have a market cap of 620 billion rupees to form a financial services giant. The merger is expected to be beneficial for the entities as the businesses are complimentary in nature. SBI was also in the limelight after media reports indicated that SBI Life will soon come out with an initial public offering, which could value it around 650-700 billion rupees. On the macro data front, manufacturing PMI data highlighted a slowdown in growth across India's manufacturing sector during June. It fell to a four-month low of 50.9, down from 51.6 in May. Services PMI climbed to 53.1 in June from the previous month's 52.2, making it the fifth consecutive month the index has been above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The output of eight core infrastructure industries improved 3.6 percent in May. However, fresh investment growth hit a 25-year low, which also means that credit offtake will take a longer time to improve.  In the coming week, IIP for May and CPI data for June will be announced on Wednesday, while WPI for June is set to be released on Friday. Globally, Eurozone IIP for May is scheduled to be released on Wednesday while U.S. non-farm payroll data for June and IIP data for May will be announced on Friday.  The coming week will also mark the beginning of the first quarter earnings season for India Inc, with IndusInd Bank, TCS and Infosys the key companies to report their numbers during the week. Management commentary on impact of GST on volume growth, margins and various ongoing price revisions will be in focus.  The GST rollout seems to have started on a positive note and this could be the simplest stage of the implementation. The next phase is the more complicated one which includes reporting and reconcilation across the GST chain. The IT back-end would face its acid test - there are already reports of pile-up of goods meant for exports due to confusion on treatment for goods. Investors need to stay cautious until the second phase of GST implementation in over – hopefully without any major glitch, coupled with positive commentaries from companies after reporting their Q1 earnings.

He went 3-for-4 with two doubles and two runs scored as the Pittsburgh Pirates rallied to beat the Chicago Cubs 4-2 on Saturday night.  I just like putting his name in the lineup and letting him play,  manager Clint Hurdle said.  I just like what he does. He's dangerous in the box. He's got a short memory and he continues to work hard to improve.  Gregory Polanco hit a go-ahead home run in the sixth inning and Ivan Nova allowed just three hits as the Pirates evened the three-game series. Using his change-up effectively, Nova (9-6) held the Cubs to two runs in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out six and walked one.  It's what we've seen from this guy since we got him,  Hurdle said.  It was a good mix of pitches, sinker played down.  Felipe Rivero got four outs for his sixth save. Kyle Schwarber and Ian Happ hit back-to-back home runs to give the Cubs a 2-1 lead in the fourth. Schwarber hit his first home run since he returned to the Cubs following a demotion to Triple-A Iowa, as Chicago tried to win consecutive games for the first time since June 18-20. Schwarber's 13th home run of the season arrived two pitches after Happ connected. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at CubsPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchThe Cubs have hit consecutive home runs three times this season. Happ has at least one hit in 16 of his last 18 games.  Schwarbs looked good -- short movements, quick to the ball,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. The Pirates claimed a 3-2 lead on Polanco's eighth home run, a two-run shot, in the sixth inning that extended his hitting streak to eight games. Bell scored after leading off with his second double. Francisco Cervelli scored from first on Jordy Mercer's double. A year ago, Bell made his debut, also against Cubs starter Jake Arrieta, when Bell smacked a pinch-hit single on the first pitch he saw.  I just feel like it's my approach working for me, just trying to drive the ball back up the middle,  Bell said.  He's done some things against some other people as well,  Hurdle added. Arrieta (8-7) allowed four runs (three earned) and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. He was coming off his best start of the season, limiting the Cincinnati Reds to one hit in seven shutout innings.  I relied heavily on the sinker and made two mistakes the cost us, really, on the Polanco home run and the lead-off double to Bell,  Arrieta said.  It's my job to hold the lead. It's upsetting that I couldn't do that in that situation.  Arrieta was 0-3 with a 7.81 ERA in his previous five starts against Pittsburgh after he went 9-1 with a 1.46 ERA in his first 12 starts versus the club.  Below average for me as an individual and honestly for the team,  Arrieta said about his first-half performance.   We haven't been able to sustain a streak for as long as we would like. But we're a five- or six-game winning streak from being right there.  The Cubs left runners at the corners in the eighth after pinch hitter Tommy La Stella doubled and advanced on a groundout before Kris Bryant drew a walk. The Pirates had taken a 1-0 lead in the top of the fourth on a Cervelli groundout with runners at second and third. Bell led off with a double and David Freese was hit by a pitch before they advanced on a passed ball. Bell scored an unearned run on Cervelli's grounder. NOTES: Pirates LHP Antonio Bastardo (0-1, 15.00 ERA) was designated for assignment Saturday. He allowed two runs in an inning Friday against the Cubs. Opponents scored off Bastardo in eight of his nine appearances. ... The Pirates recalled INF Phil Gosselin from Triple-A Indianapolis to take Bastardo's place on the roster. Gosselin was batting .287 at Triple-A, and playing shortstop benefitted him, manager Clint Hurdle said. Gosselin hit .135 in 24 previous games with the Pirates this season. ... Cubs RHP Kyle Hendricks (hand tendinitis) will pitch on a rehab assignment Monday with Double-A Tennessee, manager Joe Maddon said. Hendricks has been on the disabled list since June 5. ... Cubs LHP Mike Montgomery, who has been a starter, will be available out of the bullpen Sunday, Maddon said. ...

LOUIS -- Just over a month into his big league career, Paul DeJong did something no other St. Louis Cardinals shortstop has ever done. DeJong collected four extra-base hits on Saturday, following up his leadoff homer in the bottom of the third inning with three straight doubles to lead St. Louis past the New York Mets 4-1 at Busch Stadium. No eighth-place hitter in the lineup in club history has ever whacked four extra-base hits in the same game. No Cardinal rookie in 82 years has banged out four extra-base hits in one day of baseball. The last St. Louis player with four extra-base hits in the same game was Carlos Beltran five years ago. DeJong made all those stats relevant with a display that used most of the field. He deposited a Zack Wheeler offering into the left-center field seats in the third for his eighth homer of the year, then laced a double off the right-field wall and two more down the left-field line.  Hitting a homer in your first at-bat gives you a nice little boost of confidence to start the day,  DeJong said.  It was just one of those days where you're in the zone and seeing it well and not thinking too much.  Related CoveragePreview: Mets at CardinalsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchDeJong's last nine at-bats have produced eight hits, seven for extra bases. Saturday's hitting display upped his average from .283 to .306, and could lead to a promotion of sorts for him in the constantly changing lineup of manager Mike Matheny. Not that Matheny was going to tip his hand.  Seems to work for him hitting eighth,  Matheny said of DeJong.  I like the whole package with what he's doing defensively. You get an opportunity, make the most of it and trust yourself.  Adam Wainwright (10-5) appeared to take that advice to heart on the mound. After giving up six runs in the fifth inning of a 14-6 win Monday night over Miami, Wainwright bounced back with a much more consistent performance. Mixing speeds from 63 to 94, Wainwright gave up only five hits and a run over 6 2/3 innings, walking none and whiffing seven.  Last game was a good lesson for me,  he said.  I didn't need to do anything but what I was doing. I've proven when I'm out there and making pitches, and executing, things work out like they're supposed to.  Wainwright retired 14 of the first 15 men he faced and sailed into the seventh inning with a two-hitter. After flipping a 63 mph curve to induce a harmless fly ball from Yoenis Cespedes, Wainwright ran into his only turbulence when Jay Bruce cracked his 23rd homer to right-center field. Two singles later in the inning knocked Wainwright out in favor of Matt Bowman. The reliever induced an inning-ending popup from Travis d'Arnaud to end the threat. DeJong took care of the rest. His leadoff double sparked a seventh inning rally that Stephen Piscotty punctuated with an RBI single to right for a 3-1 lead. One inning later, DeJong worked an eight-pitch at-bat against Rafael Montero. The eighth pitch wound up in the left field corner, scoring pinch-runner Alex Mejia from first to cap the scoring. Seung Hwan Oh worked around two one-out singles in the ninth for his 18th save in 21 chances as the Cardinals (42-45) improved to 5-4 on a 10-game homestand. Lucas Duda and Jose Reyes each represented the potential tying run, but flew out to seal the outcome. Wheeler (3-6) pitched six innings, giving up eight hits and two runs. He walked one and fanned five.  I think the fastball command was there, better than it has been so I'm happy with that,  Wheeler said.

Tied 4-4 in the bottom of the 10th inning, the Dodgers drew four consecutive walks from Royals relievers Scott Alexander (three) and Kelvin Herrera (one) to collect a 5-4 victory. All came on a 3-2 pitch. Chase Utley, Corey Seager, Justin Turner and Clay Bellinger walked the line to first to give the Dodgers their 60th victory of the season and 25th in their last 29 games. Bellinger had a double in the third and a game-tying home run in the eighth, his 25th of the season and first in 11 games. He's the second-fastest player in major league history to hit 25 home runs in his career, doing it in 69 games. The record is 25 in 67 by Chicago White Sox slugger Jose Abreu.  We like to work counts against certain pitchers. It's just good execution,  Bellinger said.  I missed my pitch on a 3-1 fastball, then he came inside with a slider. We put extra focus on what to expect from Herrera because we knew we'd face him in a tough situation. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at DodgersKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatch Four walks is pretty crazy, but we always think we can find a way to win in those situations.   You take a win however you get it,  Seager said. The Royals spotted the Dodgers a 3-0 lead with two of the runs coming on Joc Pederson's ninth home run of the season in the second. The Royals put up a picket fence, solo runs in the fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth, to take a 4-3 lead, the last coming on catcher Salvador's Perez's 18th home run of the season. Bellinger tied it in the bottom of the eighth, setting the stage for the walkathon.  I don't think I've ever seen a four-walk walk-off,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  Scott (Alexander) didn't have his usual command, and we put Kelvin in a tough situation, just hoping to get a strikeout and then a double play.  A called strike bothered the Royals earlier. They had a run in and the bases loaded in the seventh with one out when Pedro Baez struck out Lorenzo Cain looking on a 2-2 fastball. Baez then got Eric Hosmer to ground out. Cain got into an argument over the called strike with home plate umpire Bill Miller as he was coming on the field in the bottom of seventh, and was ejected.  It was hard to tell at the time,  Yost said.  It looked a few inches off on replay. Lorenzo has a great eye. He can tell. If he thought it was off, then it was off.  The Dodgers are 17-1 in their last 18 home games and 38-11 on the season. They became the third Dodgers team to win 60 or more games before the All-Star break. The Royals dropped their second game after coming to town with six wins in their last seven games. They're 18-8 in their last 26 contests. Dodgers starter Brandon McCarthy went six innings, allowing two runs, six hits, two walks and a wild pitch. He got out of a three-hit third with one run thanks to Pederson throwing out Jorge Bonifacio at home, and endured a touch of wildness that led to a run in the fifth. Royals starter Ian Kennedy allowed seven hits and three runs but stranded four runners in scoring position. He retired 11 of last 13 batters he faced. Whit Merrifield, Bonifacio, Hosmer, Perez and Alcides Escobar each had two hits for the Royals. Merrifield doubled and score the second Royals run and drove in the third.

Truex lapped all but the top eight cars in the running order and had a lead of more than 13 seconds on Kyle Larson when Kurt Busch blew an engine and brought out the eighth and final caution of the race with three laps remaining of the 267-lap scheduled distance. As a result of the late-race caution, the event went into overtime.  I sputtered off of turn four, and when I looked at the fuel gauge, it was fine. And then it was like everything was welding itself together,  Busch said.  I was just trying to nurse it home and it just didn't quite get all the way back. I think it just shucked the pinion and it had no power after that. It burned up a gear one lap from the finish.  I hate that I'm that guy that jukes up the whole system with throwing a yellow with one to go. It was a long green flag run, and I thought we were going to be OK with our Haas Automation Ford. Just a bummer. We didn't need that one.  Truex stayed out, but everyone behind him pitted. Busch started next to him on the front row with four new tires. Larson pushed Truex out in front of Busch on the final restart and took second for himself after racing from the back to the front twice throughout the race.  I thought we were dead. I thought we were done,  Truex said.  It's just -- this is completely unbelievable. I'm so excited to win here. It felt like we had a shot last year, and it got away from us on fuel mileage and just wanted to win here so so bad after that. This is sweet redemption.  Chase Elliott and Denny Hamlin also got by Busch to finish third and fourth. Busch wound up fifth, but after the race his car was missing one of the mandatory 20 lug nuts. After the race field passed the overtime line, Matt Kenseth, Austin Dillon, Daniel Suarez and others wrecked, and the yellow flag that waved because of the incident ended the race. Larson passed Truex, but the race-ending yellow flag had already been displayed. After Truex and Busch ran first and second through most of the first 160 laps of the race, they wound up seventh and eighth to start the third stage of the race after a four-tire pit strategy. Joey Logano and Ryan Blaney stayed out to restart the third stage on the front row, and several other drivers pitted but took only two tires. Truex got back up to the lead in a handful of laps, but Busch struggled to get back to the front. After a green-flag cycle of stops that spanned about 20 laps with just under 60 laps to go, Busch came out in second, but he was 11 seconds behind Truex. When Larson took second, he trailed Truex by 13 seconds. Truex and Busch dominated the top-two positions in the running order in the first two stages that combined to make up the first 160 laps. Truex claimed his series-leading 12th and 13th stage wins of the year by winning of the first two 80-lap stages. Busch was second in each stage after dominating early each time. Busch started on the pole and led until Truex got by him on lap 67 en route to the stage-one win. But when the race restarted at the beginning of the second stage, Busch retook the lead. Truex took another late-stage lead from Busch, though, around lap 135. Larson was third at the end of the first stage after starting in the back as a result of not making a qualifying attempt Friday when his car failed to get through pre-qualifying inspection. By the time the yellow flag waved for a competition caution on lap 30, he was in the top 20. Larson took four tires during the caution as many cars in front of him took two. Larson continued his march toward the front, and with three laps remaining in the opening stage, he took third from Chip Ganassi Racing teammate Jamie McMurray. Larson was in the back again, though, to start stage two after a pit-road speeding penalty between stages. Hamlin also was assessed a speeding penalty after running in or near the top-five throughout the first 80 laps.  Yeah, I sped on pit road there early,  Larson said.  At the end of that first stage, so it felt very similar to Texas earlier this year. Didn't get to qualify, had a pit road penalty at the end of the first stage. Went from the back to the front and then we had scuffs on one run and got the balance off pretty bad but were able to put stickers on and charge back to the front. The Target Chevy was good.  Larson drove back toward the front again and was sixth by the time the yellow flag waved for Joey Gase on lap 136. He backslid several positions, though, on the restart that followed as he battled a possible electrical problem. While the first stage ran incident free, the early laps of the second stage were marred by two separate multi-car incidents. A three-car wreck forced the retirement of three-time Kentucky winner Brad Keselowski and three-time 2017 race winner Jimmie Johnson. Clint Bowyer's car also sustained damage, but he was able to continue. A few laps later, Kasey Kahne and Trevor Bayne wrecked. A Bayne spin several laps later resulted in another caution.  I just got in an aero wake and it pulled me around. I knew I was in a bad spot,  Keselowski said.  I was trying to lay up, but there is only so much you can lay up here because you get ran over from behind. The air pulled me around. It sucks. I feel bad for everyone on the Miller Lite Ford team, and I think I tore up two or three other guys and that sucks for them. I don't know.  It is kind of a tough spot to be in on these tracks where they are kind of one groove. You can't just lay up every time. You give up too many spots or get ran over from behind. If you drive in with someone close to you, the car just spins out. It just sucks, but it is what it is. We have to find a way around it and we didn't today.

Three Cleveland pitchers combined on a four-hit shutout as the Indians beat the Detroit Tigers 4-0 on Saturday night at Progressive Field. It's the ninth shutout by Indians' pitchers this season, lowering their league-leading team ERA to 3.77. In their last seven games, Indians' starters have a 1.96 ERA. Cleveland starter Mike Clevinger (5-3) pitched six innings and allowed three hits and two walks with four strikeouts. Andrew Miller pitched two innings and retired all six batters he faced, and Cody Allen worked the ninth. In two starts against the Tigers this season, both coming in the last week, Clevinger is 2-0 with a 0.75 ERA.  He's improving with every start, and it's sure nice to see,  Indians acting manager Brad Mills said.  This should give him a lot of confidence going into the break.  Detroit starter Justin Verlander (5-6) pitched 6 2/3 innings, allowing one run and six hits with six strikeouts and four walks.  His command was good, and his curveball was really good in the middle innings,  said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus, who is more concerned with his team's lack of offense than its pitching. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at IndiansDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatch We've got to find a way to squeeze out some runs. (Four hits) generally doesn't cut it,  said Ausmus, whose team has been outscored 15-2 in the first two games in Cleveland.  We're just not getting big hits, and it's happening more frequently than we would have thought.  Leading 1-0, the Indians added three insurance runs in the eighth inning. With one out, Lonnie Chisenhall drew an 11-pitch walk from reliever Bruce Rondon.  Rondon was doing everything he could. He was throwing the kitchen sink at him, but Lonnie kept fouling them off and fouling them off,  Mills said. Carlos Santana followed with a double into the gap in right-center field, scoring Chisenhall. Santana went to third on a throwing error by second baseman Ian Kinsler, then scored when Bradley Zimmer drove a triple into the same right-center field gap to make it 3-0. Yan Gomes followed with a sacrifice fly to score Zimmer, extending the lead to 4-0. The Indians' first three hits were doubles. Jason Kipnis doubled leading off the first inning but was left stranded. Santana doubled with two outs in the second but was left on base, as was Chisenhall after a two-out double in the fourth. J.D. Martinez led off the Detroit second with a double, but Clevinger retired Victor Martinez on a fly ball, Nicholas Castellanos on a groundout and Mikie Mahtook on a strikeout to end the inning. Verlander held Cleveland scoreless on three hits through the first four innings, as he and Clevinger, who was a big Verlander fan growing up, kept putting up zeroes.  When he won the Cy Young Award, I think I was 16,  Clevinger said.  He had that 100-mph fastball and that power curve. Everyone wanted to be like him. It's kind of surreal facing him now.  The Indians broke the scoreless tie in the fifth. After Verlander struck out the first two batters of the inning, Francisco Lindor singled and scored when Michael Brantley, capping another long at bat, ripped a double into the gap in right-center field, giving Cleveland a 1-0 lead.  I just tried to battle. He stays on the corners of the plate, so I just tried to keep fouling them off until I could get one I could handle,  Brantley said.  Brantley's a good hitter,  Ausmus said.  He's going to the All-Star game for a reason.  Verlander was removed from the game with two on and two outs in the seventh inning, after throwing 115 pitches.  Even though he got the loss, I'm sure he's happy with the way he pitched, and he should be,  Ausmus said. NOTES: Indians manager Terry Francona was discharged from Cleveland Clinic, where he underwent a procedure to correct a cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) Thursday. He will spend the All-Star break resting at his residence in Cleveland, then rejoin the Indians in Oakland on July 14, their first game after the break.

A report by Earthsight, a UK-based environmental investigation group, revealed many popular brands of charcoal sold in petrol stations and supermarkets are produced in the dry tropical forests of Chaco - but not marked as such. Home to a plethora of wildlife, including jaguar and giant armadillo, the Chaco was described by David Attenborough as  one of the last great wilderness areas in the world , and it is home to many of Paraguay's 110,000 indigenous people. But as the South American nation becomes one of the world's largest charcoal exporters, Earthsight fears much of this charcoal is coming from Chaco land deforested for beef, impacting indigenous people but consumers are unaware of this. Agriculture makes up a significant proportion of Paraguay's economy with beef and soybeans its leading exports and an aim to have 20 million head of cattle by 2020, up from about 13 million, according the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  The trees felled as a result of the advance of industrial agriculture into pristine wilderness are being turned into charcoal to feed demand in Europe,  said Earthsight's report.  The dry tropical forests of the Chaco are being destroyed faster than any other forests on earth.  While the Paraguayan constitution recognises the rights of indigenous people, they do not have the right to withhold consent for intensive agriculture projects on their customary lands, according to a 2015 United Nations report. Global Forest Watch, which monitors tree cover worldwide using satellite data, has identified Paraguay as one of the world's notable hot spots for deforestation. A 2017 analysis of data over the 12 years to 2012 by the University of Maryland data estimates Chaco has lost more than 200,000 hectares, or 2,000 square kms, of forest this year - equivalent to an area the size of Manhattan every fortnight. Origins Unclear Earthsight's investigation revealed that Paraguayan firms which sell and distribute bulk charcoal into Europe and the United States openly advertise the fuel's origins -  but distributors in Europe and the United States do not. Dolimex, one of Paraguay's top exporters, says on its website  100 percent of our raw material comes from the forests of the Paraguayan Chaco, where there are  abundant species of high density like the white Quebracho (tree) . But Earthsight said when the bulk product is bagged into locally branded packaging by distributors buying from Paraguay and selling to supermarkets and petrol stations in the United States and Europe, there is often no mention of the Chaco and, in some cases, bags are marked to come from 'recycled wood'.  (Some) distributors are peddling false and misleading claims regarding the sustainability of the products flooding European supermarket shelves, masking their role in this environmental crisis,  Earthsight said. Dolimex could not be immediately reached for comment. Charcoal is made by cooking wood in large brick ovens in a low oxygen environment and burning off compounds such as water, methane, hydrogen, and tar to leave black lumps and powder. Earthsight said its on-the-ground research traced charcoal samples sold in Europe back to brick ovens in the Chaco forests run by Paraguay's biggest charcoal exporter, Bricapar. Bricapar's distribution website shows photographs of familiar European and U.S. charcoal bags packaged in local branding with a logo saying its charcoal briquettes are made from  recycled and controlled sources . Bricapar did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The Earthsight report said cattle ranching was the primary driver of deforestation in the Chaco and charcoal production provided a lucrative incentive to justify the up-front costs of clearing forest for cattle. But the Chaco is home to many indigenous tribes that have long lived and sheltered in the tropical forests - such as the Ayoreo community which is believed to be the last remaining 'uncontacted' indigenous group outside the Amazon basin. The Earthsight report said European consumers needed to be sure they are  not unwittingly contributing to the loss of the precious Chaco  and this would require action by both the major supermarkets and the European Union.  The supermarkets must investigate more thoroughly the source of relevant products such as charcoal and beef, and be more sceptical of sustainability claims made by suppliers,  the report concluded (Reporting by Paola Totaro, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights and climate change.
