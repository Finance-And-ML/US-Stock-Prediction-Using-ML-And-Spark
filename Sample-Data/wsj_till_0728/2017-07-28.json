The same bill passed the House on Tuesday, 419-3. The overwhelming majority showed the president that there was enough strength in Congress to override a veto should he choose to block the legislation.While the measure was debated in Congress, White House officials wouldn\u2019t commit to whether the president would sign the bill, saying it may infringe on presidential authority. The bill included a provision that would require the president to consult Congress before relaxing any sanctions against Moscow or restoring Russia\u2019s control over diplomatic compounds in the U.S. that had been seized by the Obama administration as part of U.S. reprisals for the alleged election interference.Mr. Trump has expressed skepticism about U.S. intelligence findings that Russia meddled in the election. Russia has denied the allegations.Should the bill become law, the president would have to notify Congress if he wants to lift sanctions on Moscow. Congress then would have 30 days to pass a resolution of disapproval to stop the president. Should Mr. Trump veto that resolution, Congress would have 10 days to override the veto.The legislation represents a political challenge for the president, coming as congressional committees and Special Counsel       Robert Mueller       are investigating Russia\u2019s actions last year in a probe that also is seeking to determine whether anyone in the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Mr. Trump and Russian officials have denied any collusion.A U.S. intelligence assessment in January concluded that the alleged Russian interference was directed from the highest levels of its government. Its tactics allegedly included hacking state election systems; infiltrating and leaking information from party committees and political strategists; and using social media and other outlets to disseminate negative stories about Democratic nominee       Hillary Clinton       and positive messages about Mr. Trump.Russia didn\u2019t wait for the White House to announce whether Mr. Trump would sign the bill to retaliate. Moscow struck back Friday, forcing Washington to cut its diplomatic presence in the country to 455 and close a U.S. diplomatic retreat outside Moscow. If the limit applies to overall staff, the result would be a dramatic reduction in the U.S. government\u2019s operation in the country, which includes the embassy in Moscow and consulates in St. Petersburg, Vladivostok and Yekaterinburg.The bill would tighten restrictions on the extension of credit to Russian entities and mandate sanctions on those deemed to be undermining cybersecurity as well as those engaging in significant transactions involving the Russian defense and intelligence sectors.It would allow some joint energy ventures to go ahead but would sanction new projects and joint ventures in which a sanctioned Russian person or entity holds a stake of 33% or more.The bill maintains a provision that says the president may impose penalties on firms backing a high-profile Russian pipeline project but stops short of mandating penalties. That provision has upset Europeans because it poses a potential risk to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a Gazprom project backed by a consortium of five European companies, to transport gas from Russia to Europe through the Baltic Sea.After European countries, including Germany and Austria, protested, lawmakers added a stipulation that the president may impose sanctions, but \u201cin coordination with allies of the United States.\u201dU.S. energy companies had lobbied Congress against the bill, citing their concern over an earlier version that included measures to block partnerships with Russian individuals or companies, which they said could scuttle any U.S. business partnership that involved Russian entities.The U.S. Treasury Department recently imposed a $2 million fine on             Exxon Mobil Corp.       for signing eight documents relating to oil and gas projects in Russia that were also signed by       Igor Sechin,        who was under U.S. sanctions at the time.The legislation also imposes new sanctions on Iran\u2019s ballistic-missile program and the Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps, and attempts to squeeze the cash available to North Korea for its nuclear and ballistic-missile programs.Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.comAppeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Set to Sign Russia Sanctions Bill.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-sign-russia-sanctions-bill-1501293345", "keywords": [" donald trump, hacking of hillary clinton emails, russian interference in election,russia sanctions,Donald Trump,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,elections,national,presidential elections"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 22:48:00", "news_title": "Russia to Kick Out Some U.S. Diplomats Over Sanctions ", "content": "Russia struck out at the U.S. on Friday, forcing Washington to cut its diplomatic presence in the country and closing a U.S. diplomatic retreat outside Moscow after Congress passed a new round of sanctions against Russia.Legislation passed by both the House and the Senate this week tightens existing sanctions and introduces a set of new measures to punish Russia for alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election. The legislation also would prevent President       Donald Trump       from easing sanctions without congressional approval.Mr. Trump, who has expressed skepticism over allegations of Russia\u2019s role in the election, plans to sign the sanctions bill, the White House said Friday. Russian authorities said there was no need to wait for the president\u2019s signature to act.\u201cThe most recent events show that Russophobia has taken hold in certain circles in the United States as has a course of open confrontation with our country,\u201d the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.The Russian measures will reduce the number of U.S. diplomatic and technical staff in Russia as of Sept. 1 to 455, the same number of Russian diplomats now operating in the U.S. after then-President       Barack Obama      expelled 35 late last year, the Russian foreign ministry said.It wasn\u2019t clear how many people are employed by the U.S. embassy or whether the positions included Russian foreign-service nationals. But the reduction would lead to the expulsion of around 700 staff members, said Russian parliamentary vice speaker       Sergei Zheleznyak.That would make the Russian measures far outweigh the U.S. expulsion of diplomats last year and constitute the biggest effective expulsion of diplomats in U.S.-Russian bilateral history.One former official said the U.S. had about 1,100 people working for the embassy in recent years but more than half were local hires.If the limit applies to overall staff, the result would be a dramatic reduction in the U.S. government\u2019s operation in the country, which includes the embassy in Moscow and consulates in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok.Vast staff reductions could delay visa issuance, slow information exchanges on law enforcement and anti-terrorism matters, and crimp U.S. efforts to gather information about Russia for officials in Washington at a time when relations between Washington and Moscow have reached their lowest state since the Cold War.\u201cOf course any reduction in staff at one of the most important embassies in our world is not good for America,\u201d said former U.S. Ambassador to Russia       Michael McFaul.       \u201cWhen I was ambassador, we did not have a lot of excess staff. Everybody was pretty maxed out, I would say, given the assignment we had. So this is not good.\u201dThe largest-to-date diplomatic expulsion occurred in 1986, when President       Ronald Reagan       ordered 55 Soviet diplomats to leave the country over espionage allegations.\u201cThis will be felt by American diplomacy,\u201d Mr. Zheleznyak said on state television. \u201cThe measures against the United States have been a long time coming.\u201dThe ministry also ordered a diplomatic retreat in a forested complex outside Moscow shuttered from Aug. 1 and closed diplomatic storage sites.The measure looks to be a tit-for-tat move in response to U.S. authorities\u2019 decision last year to deny Russian diplomats access to two Moscow-owned compounds\u2014one in New York and one in Maryland\u2014used by Russian diplomats.Mr. McFaul said he rejected the notion the steps taken Friday were a symmetrical response from Russia to sanctions on Moscow because \u201cnone of those people in the U.S. embassy in Moscow\u2014they didn\u2019t interfere with Russia\u2019s election, they didn\u2019t steal data and publish it, they\u2019re innocent.\u201dFormer embassy employees said Russia\u2019s seizure of the U.S. embassy dacha in Moscow wouldn\u2019t matter as much as the U.S. seizure of Russia\u2019s two diplomatic vacation compounds in New York and Maryland. The Russian compounds are sprawling mansions once owned by the American elite, whereas the U.S. embassy dacha is a small wooden house in a northern Moscow park.The sanctions compound a number of problems the Trump administration is facing, including an investigation into ties between members of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle and Russian officials.They also accelerate a downward trajectory in Russia-U.S. relations: Mr. Trump took office amid hopes in Russia that a new U.S. administration would move quickly to repair relations, but Moscow and Washington remain sharply at odds over Ukraine crisis and have serious differences over Syria policy.Andrey Kortunov       of the Russian Council on Foreign Relations said the new sanctions appear to demonstrate to Russian President       Vladimir Putin       that Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t have the political capital to improve Russian relations.\u201cPutin doesn\u2019t like other presidents who can\u2019t deliver,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will see a new tack from Russia toward the United States.\u201dThe U.S. ambassador,       John Tefft,        was called to the Foreign Ministry on Friday and informed of the decision to implement the measures by Russian authorities, the ministry said.Mr. Tefft \u201cexpressed his strong disappointment and protest,\u201d and the Russian government\u2019s notification has been passed on to Washington, a U.S. embassy spokesperson said.Alexei Pushkov,        the chairman of the upper house of parliament\u2019s committee on information policy, said Russia could impose new sanctions on the U.S., including economic measures.\u201cThe United States has been carrying out an economic war against a number of our companies,\u201d he said, without going into details of possible new measures.Russian authorities say the sanctions passed in Congress, which include a provision allowing the president to impose penalties on firms packing high-profile Russian pipeline projects, are merely a pretext to cut Russian gas exports to its largest trading partner, the European Union.It would allow some joint energy ventures to go ahead, but would sanction new projects and joint ventures in which a sanctioned Russian person or entity holds a stake of 33% or more.That provision has upset Europeans because it poses a potential risk to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project of the Russian gas giant Gazprom backed by a consortium of five European companies, to transport gas from Russia to Europe through the Baltic Sea.Write to Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.com and Paul Sonne at paul.sonne@wsj.comAppeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'Moscow Expels U.S. Diplomats.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-to-kick-out-some-u-s-diplomats-over-sanctions-1501238985", "keywords": ["congress,donald trump,european union,politics,russia ,russian embassy,russia sanctions,russia-u.s. relations,u.s.,u.s. embassy,vladimir putin,Russian Foreign Ministry,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections,state department"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 22:42:00", "news_title": "Russia Sanctions Breakthrough", "content": "The Senate Thursday followed the House in voting overwhelmingly for a much-improved bill imposing sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. Even before the bill could reach President Trump\u2019s desk,       Vladimir Putin       vowed he would not tolerate such \u201cinsolence.\u201d On Friday the Russian Foreign Ministry retaliated by closing down a recreational retreat on the outskirts of Moscow used by American Embassy staff and ordered the U.S. to cut its diplomatic presence. All the more reason for Mr. Trump to sign.The bill passed with huge, veto-proof majorities in the House (419-3) and Senate (98-2) in a rare show of bipartisanship. The legislation raps a broad array of Russian entities as punishment for U.S. election interference, military activity in eastern Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, support for       Bashar Assad       in Syria and global cyberattacks.The bills also levies sanctions on Iran for terrorism funding and its efforts to destabilize the Middle East. As part of a compromise between the House and Senate, it also incorporates North Korea sanctions, taking aim at       Kim Jong Un\u2019s       nuclear program.The big change is a compromise over how Congress holds the Trump Administration to account on implementing these penalties. House Democrats wanted the power to introduce legislation to block the President if he removed sanctions\u2014a significant break with traditional House minority rights. Negotiators instead crafted a deal by which any Senator can introduce a resolution of disapproval against the Administration if it lifts sanctions. If that resolution passes the Senate, it is then heard in expedited fashion in the House.The final bill fixes Senate language that threatened to undermine U.S. oil and gas companies. The bill now counts for sanctions purposes only those global energy projects in which Russia has a 33% or greater stake. This change is vital to U.S. firms that work in deepwater oil fields where host countries require all leaseholders to jointly develop such infrastructure as pipelines. This modest ownership threshold stops Moscow from strategically buying leases to force U.S. companies out of projects.The White House initially signaled that Mr. Trump would likely sign the bill, but new communications director       Anthony Scaramucci       said before the Senate vote that he might veto it. On Friday night, no doubt recognizing the bill would become law either with Mr. Trump\u2019s signature or with a veto override, the White House announced he will sign. In signing it Mr. Trump also sends a message to Mr. Putin.Republicans in Congress deserve credit for holding a GOP President to greater scrutiny than Democrats were ever willing to impose on       Barack Obama.       The Congressional liberals who are now crowing about this executive check blocked Republicans from oversight over Mr. Obama\u2019s Iranian sanctions. They also let Mr. Obama avoid submitting the Iran deal to the Senate as the treaty it was, where it would have needed 67 votes.We generally support presidential flexibility on sanctions, but Mr. Trump\u2019s flirtation with Mr. Putin has brought this bill\u2019s limitation on himself. Russia needs to see that there is a political consensus in the U.S. that won\u2019t tolerate meddling in U.S. elections.Appeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-sanctions-breakthrough-1501280927", "keywords": ["Russian Foreign Ministry,Barack Obama,political,general news,crime,legal action,international relations,international sanctions,cybercrime,hacking,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions,editorials"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 22:32:00", "news_title": "Trump Names Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly as New Chief of Staff", "content": "President       Donald Trump       replaced Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on Friday with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general.The shift at the top of the White House hierarchy is aimed at bringing order to an administration that has been beset by infighting, as Mr. Trump seeks to notch the sort of sweeping legislative victories that he promised during the campaign but that have eluded him to this point, advisers to the president said.\u201cJohn Kelly will do a fantastic job. Gen. Kelly has been a star, done an incredible job thus far, respected by everybody,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters Friday.The president told Mr. Priebus two weeks ago he was planning to bring in a new staff chief, a senior administration official said. Mr. Kelly was offered the job earlier this week and immediately accepted, the senior official said.Mr. Trump discussed bringing in Mr. Kelly with a small group of people, the senior official said. Part of the draw, the official said, was that he believes Mr. Kelly can provide effective leadership and has the respect of the West Wing, which is staffed with aides whose ideology falls across the political spectrum.After Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, which came as Air Force One landed in Washington after a flight from New York, the president posted a tweet thanking Mr. Priebus \u201cfor his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him!\u201dMr. Trump stayed on the plane while Mr. Priebus and other top aides disembarked. Mr. Priebus\u2019s car left the motorcade before Mr. Trump got off the plane.Rep.       Peter King       (R., N.Y.), who was on the plane, said he spoke to Mr. Priebus during the flight from Long Island and was unaware the chief of staff had been replaced. \u201cGood poker face. Showed nothing,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know it.\u201dMr. King said that as he was preparing to disembark, the president told him and other lawmakers on the flight he would announce Mr. Kelly as chief of staff.White House press secretary       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       told reporters that Messrs. Trump and Priebus began discussing the chief of staff\u2019s departure about two weeks ago. Asked when the president offered Mr. Kelly the job, she said, \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about it for a while.\u201dMr. Priebus told The Wall Street Journal he submitted his letter of resignation on Thursday. In an interview later with CNN, he said Mr. Trump \u201cobviously wanted to make a change, and I offered my resignation, and he agreed. And we moved on.\u201dHe said he and the president discussed naming Mr. Kelly as his successor and said Mr. Trump \u201cknows intuitively when things need to change.\u201dMr. Priebus\u2019s status seemed shakier after Mr. Trump installed       Anthony Scaramucci      as communications director.Messrs. Scaramucci and Priebus openly feuded, creating a level of tension in the West Wing that advisers said wasn\u2019t sustainable. Mr. Scaramucci this week gave a profanity-laced interview to the New Yorker magazine in which he disparaged Mr. Priebus and other top staffers. One adviser who has spoken with the president said Mr. Trump was dismissive of Mr. Priebus for not returning fire.Asked on CNN about Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s criticism, Mr. Priebus said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the mud on those sorts of things.\u201dAs homeland security secretary, Mr. Kelly was charged with overseeing implementation of Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban, which has faced a series of holdups in the courts. The most recent version seeks to impose a 90-day ban on U.S. entry for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and to suspend temporarily the U.S. program for admitting refugees. Mr. Trump said the order would help prevent terrorism.Before joining the cabinet, Mr. Kelly served as chief of the U.S. Southern Command, the division that oversees U.S. military activities south of Mexico, including Central America, South America and the Caribbean. In that role he focused on homeland-security issues because the post involved monitoring drug trafficking and other smuggling activity south of the U.S.Mr. Kelly, 67 years old, also served as legislative assistant to the Marine Corps commandant, gaining experience in dealing with Congress.He has a personal history that reflects the tragedies of war. His son, Marine 2nd Lt. Robert Kelly, was killed by a land mine in Afghanistan in 2010. On learning of the death, Marine Gen.       Joseph Dunford Jr.      , now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put on his dress blues and waited outside Mr. Kelly\u2019s home at the Washington Navy Yard in the wee hours to inform his friend.Among other duties, Mr. Kelly oversaw operations at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and commanded U.S. troops in Iraq. He joined the Marines in 1970 and retired last year. On Friday, he said, \u201cI am honored to be asked to serve as the chief of staff to the president of the United States.\u201dThe appointment capped one of the most turbulent weeks in Mr. Trump\u2019s young presidency, exposing the difficulty he has had in adapting his executive style to the policy-making arena, veterans of past administrations said. In the space of a week, he saw his press secretary,       Sean Spicer,        resign, his health-care bill implode, and the exit of his chief of staff.Though Mr. Trump sees himself as a disruptive force in Washington, some presidential advisers say they believe the internal friction and a fraying of the Republican governing coalition threaten his agenda.In a check on Mr. Trump\u2019s power, the Senate this week approved a bill that forced his hand in stiffening sanctions on Russia. If he vetoed it, he would be open to suggestions that he is being soft on Russia. The White House said late Friday that Mr. Trump would sign the bill.Peter Wehner,        who worked in the past three Republican administrations, said of the White House: \u201cThere\u2019s no strategic thinking. There\u2019s no competent execution. It\u2019s just a free-for-all.\u201dA pattern that emerges in White House staff shuffles over the last six months is that Mr. Trump is parting ways with people who represent the Republican establishment. He is bringing in people who aren\u2019t as closely tied to the Republican mainstream, a reality that could complicate his relationship with donors and state party officials.For success in the push to lower tax rates and simplify the tax code, both the White House and congressional Republicans seem to agree Mr. Trump needs a different approach than the hands-off posture he had on health care.White House aides are hoping to get the president on the road for public rallies and smaller stops aimed at showcasing the tax plan. One idea is to have him sit down at a kitchen table with a family in the Midwest or visit farms and small businesses.Also under consideration is a kickoff event at the       Ronald Reagan       Library in California, an official said. It would aim to draw a symbolic connection to another celebrity-turned-Republican president, Mr. Reagan, who ushered in the last major tax overhaul three decades ago.\u201cYou can\u2019t just talk about winning, you have to take steps toward winning,\u201d said       Jason Miller,        a former Trump campaign strategist who continues to advise the president, in an interview before Mr. Kelly\u2019s new job was announced. \u201cThe White House has to remember the fact that the business community and the middle class are looking for positive steps on tax reform.\u201dMarc Short,        the White House legislative affairs director, said in an interview: \u201cWe have cultivated a lot of organizations\u2014business coalitions, conservative advocacy groups\u2014in shaping our plan for tax reform that will provide a stronger echo chamber and outside support than we had on the health-care battle.\u201d\u2014Felicia Schwartz and Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Michael C.

The bank has said it is cooperating with those. Wells Fargo agreed to a $142 million class-action customer settlement along with related customer refunds.Regarding the auto loans, Wells Fargo said customers\u2019 contracts require them to maintain collateral-protection insurance on behalf of the lender throughout the term of the loan. Wells Fargo purchased that insurance, known as CPI, from a vendor on a customer\u2019s behalf if there was no evidence the customer already had the insurance, the bank said. That insurance protects against the loss or damage to a vehicle serving as collateral to secure a loan.The vendor is National General Insurance, a company the bank had joined with for years, a person familiar with the matter said.A spokeswoman for National General,       Christine Worley,        said it \u201cfeels confident with its compliance in this highly regulated industry.\u201d She added: \u201cWe have always refunded premiums directly to our financial institution customers in a timely manner and provided all necessary notifications in compliance with law and industry practice.\u201dWells Fargo said that, in response to customer complaints in July 2016, it began a review of the program and third-party vendor practices. Based on that review, it discontinued the program in September 2016.The             New York Timesearlier reported the problems with Wells Fargo\u2019s auto insurance, citing a report from consultant Oliver Wyman prepared for the bank examining National General insurance policies sold to Wells Fargo customers from January 2012 through July 2016. It found the insurance was often more expensive than auto-insurance customers had already obtained on their own.Wells Fargo said it has \u201cgone through a comprehensive review using independent consultants\u201d that determined certain external vendor processes and internal controls were inadequate.For instance, one result was that customers may have been charged premiums for this insurance even if they were paying for their own vehicle insurance. In some cases, those premiums could have contributed to a default that led to the vehicle\u2019s repossession.The bank has begun providing refunds to some customers and will send letters and refund checks to additional customers in August. The bank said it expects to complete the refunding process by year-end.The bank will refund about $25 million to around 490,000 customers who had so-called CPI placed for some or all the time they had already had appropriate insurance of their own.It will refund $39 million to about 60,000 customers where customers didn\u2019t receive full disclosures from Wells Fargo\u2019s vendor that are required by the five states those customers are based in.Another $16 million will be refunded to about 20,000 customers where the additional costs of this CPI insurance \u201ccontributed to a default that resulted in the repossession of their vehicle,\u201d Wells Fargo said.It added that refunds will depend on each customer\u2019s situation and will include payment \u201cabove and beyond the actual financial harm as an expression of our regret for the situation.\u201dThe bank said it will also work with credit bureaus to correct customers\u2019 credit records as applicable.\u2014Ryan Tracy contributed to this article.Write to Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.comAppeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'Wells Fargo Plans Refunds.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-to-refund-80-million-to-auto-loan-customers-for-improper-insurance-practices-1501252927", "keywords": ["auto finance,auto loans,car insurance,car loans,refunds,wells fargo car loans,Wells Fargo,WFC,WFCL,National General Insurance,Franklin Codel,plans,strategy,marketing,markets,corporate,industrial news,customer relationship management,banking,commercial banking,credit types,services,consumer lending,insurance,non-life insurance,vehicle insurance,credit,property,casualty insurance,financial services,transport,freight insurance"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 21:02:00", "news_title": "S&P 500, Nasdaq Pulled Down by Tech Sector", "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a gain for the day and the week, while a fall in technology shares contributed to declines in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.Upbeat quarterly results from large U.S. companies including Boeing, Caterpillar,             Chevron                   and Verizon Communications helped the Dow industrials outperform its peers in recent days.Together, those stocks\u2019 weekly gains contributed roughly 310 points to the index, which rose 250.24 points, or 1.2%, for the week.

Amazon fell $25.96, or 2.5%, to $1,020.04 after the company said its quarterly profit fell 77%, adding to Friday\u2019s declines in the consumer-discretionary sector.             Starbucks                   shed 5.50, or 9.2%, to 54.00 after its earnings fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations and it lowered its full-year earnings forecast.             Goodyear Tire & Rubber                   sank 2.97, or 8.4%, to 32.51 after the tire maker cut its profit outlook for the year.The tech sector of the S&P 500 slipped 0.1% Friday, extending declines from the prior session, and posted a weekly fall of 0.6%.

Now he is set to take the lead in shaping oversight at one of the greatest interveners of all: the Federal Reserve.Mr. Quarles, who would be President       Donald Trump\u2019s       first appointee to the central bank, is expected to be confirmed in coming months for a four-year term as Fed vice chairman for supervision. That would make him the most influential U.S. financial regulator and give him a voice on monetary policy.His de facto predecessor, former Fed governor       Daniel Tarullo,        engineered broad new curbs on risk-taking by the largest U.S. banks. Mr. Quarles, a 59-year-old amateur pilot and former government official who has made millions advising and investing in banks, has a record that suggests he will seek to reduce the Fed\u2019s influence on bankers\u2019 decisions, rather than expand it.\u201cSome refinements will undoubtedly be in order,\u201d Mr. Quarles told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, referring to the U.S. regulatory regime. \u201cThe key question will be ensuring that\u2026we do so while maintaining the robust resilience of the system to shocks.\u201dMr. Quarles\u2019s approach may conflict with that of Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen,        who supported Mr. Tarullo\u2019s agenda. Her term as chair ends in February. Mr. Quarles has separately advocated that the Fed articulate a more rigid formula for setting monetary policy, an idea Ms. Yellen has criticized.Randal QuarlesAge: 59Education: Bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy and economics from Columbia University, 1981; law degree from Yale University, 1984Career:\u2014Cynosure Group, 2014-2017.

Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and Senate bid of Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho). Advised Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign in 2012.Friends and former colleagues said that if Mr. Quarles does try to change direction at the Fed, they expect him to move slowly and methodically, and to seek consensus. Cerebral with a wry wit, Mr. Quarles spent nights as a young lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP reading the firm\u2019s files on railroad reorganizations in the late 19th century.\u201cI had been interested in the history of that era,\u201d he explained in a 2010 paper.When asked, \u201cHow are you?\u201d he has a stock reply, former colleagues say: \u201cBetter than average.\u201dMr. Tarullo, who left the Fed in April, cracked the whip on the largest U.S. banks in part by employing the element of surprise. In \u201cstress tests\u201d and \u201cliving wills\u201d examining how banks plan for the worst scenarios, he and other regulators ratcheted up their expectations over time and publicly rebuked bankers for perceived failings\u2014scoldings that the regulators said were necessary to clean up what they saw as woeful risk management.Bankers have called for years for more predictability in the exams, in part to avoid further public thrashings.At his confirmation hearing Thursday, Mr. Quarles said the Fed should publish more information about the stress tests. \u201cThe benefits of the transparency outweigh any of the theoretical costs,\u201d he said.Mr. Quarles also said he would review rules about banks\u2019 capital levels as well as the Volcker rule, which restricts banks from trading unless it is on customers\u2019 behalf. He avoided specifics. \u201cI don\u2019t have a view as to whether [capital requirements] should be higher or lower,\u201d he said.During his career, Mr. Quarles has repeatedly criticized unpredictable policy-making. \u201cWhen governments have discretion, markets and citizens cannot be sure how the government will act, and that uncertainty results in inefficiency, delay and politicization,\u201d he wrote in the 2010 paper.He said in 2015 that regulatory policy since the 2008 financial crisis \u201ctended to make the government a player\u201d in the financial sector when \u201cit should be a referee.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Quarles has separated himself from others who claim the \u201cfree market\u201d mantle. As a senior Treasury official in the 2000s, he advocated allowing foreign governments to have more wiggle room in dealing with bond investors\u2014a policy opposed by some Wall Street money managers. He once called       Timothy Geithner,        President       Barack Obama\u2019s       first Treasury secretary and an architect of the 2008 bailouts, \u201ca very strong choice\u201d for the cabinet position.Ravi Menon,        a Singaporean official who engaged in last-minute talks with Mr. Quarles on a U.S.-Singapore trade deal, wrote in 2004, \u201cRight from the start, we took a problem-solving approach aimed at finding middle ground rather than trying to convert each other on ideological arguments.\u201dStill, Mr. Quarles\u2019s background has raised concerns among Democrats. As a banking lawyer at       Davis Polk       in the 1990s, he helped banks such as             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. navigate regulatory limits to expand their securities businesses. He joined executives from J.P. Morgan and             HSBC Holdings                   PLC at the Salzburg Global Seminar, held in the Austrian Alps at the hotel where \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d was filmed, and co-led a discussion on the future of banking.During the financial crisis, as a partner at private-equity giant             Carlyle Group,       he lobbied successfully for regulators to allow him and other big money managers to pump money into troubled banks.\u201cThe primary purpose of this job is to stand up to the largest financial institutions in this country,\u201d Sen.       Elizabeth Warren       (D., Mass.) told Mr. Quarles Thursday. \u201cYou have no history of having done that.\u201dDespite the Democrats\u2019 concerns, Republicans alone have the votes to confirm Mr. Quarles for the job, and none criticized him Thursday. It isn\u2019t clear when they will vote on his confirmation.Mr. Quarles has had financial ties to some banks he could soon regulate. He married into Utah\u2019s Eccles family, which received a stake in             Wells Fargo                   & Co. through the sale of a Utah bank in 2000. His financial disclosure, which was signed in June, said he owns Wells Fargo stock valued at more than $1 million and has exercised lines of credit of more than $1 million each from Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley.Since 2014, he has helped manage the family\u2019s wealth at Cynosure Group, investing in financial companies including a Georgia bank holding company, Brand Group Holdings Inc. Mr. Quarles has pledged that if he is confirmed, he will unwind his bank holdings and pay back the loans to meet conflict-of-interest rules.Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-randal-quarles-trumps-pick-to-shake-up-the-fed-1501234201", "keywords": [" banks, fed, federal reserve, free markets, investor,lawyer, monetary policy, policy,quarles,regulation, regulator, supervision, vice chairman, volcker rule,Federal Reserve,Brand Group Holdings,Cynosure Group,Wells Fargo &,WFC,Morgan Stanley,Randal Quarles,government policy,regulatory bodies,management,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,monetary policy,central bank intervention,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 20:11:00", "news_title": "Sprint Proposes Merger With Charter Communications", "content": "Sprint Corp.        S -3.41%       has proposed a merger with             Charter Communications Inc.        CHTR 4.82%       that would create a media and communications giant, upending industries that are already in the throes of dramatic change.Since the end of May, Charter and             Comcast Corp.        CMCSA 2.44%had been in exclusive talks with Sprint over possible deals, including one that would allow the cable companies to resell wireless service under their own brands. Though the exclusivity window ended this week, Sprint Chairman       Masayoshi Son       continues to pursue a much larger deal with Charter, according to people familiar with the matter: a full-blown merger of the two companies.The complex proposal calls for the creation of a new publicly traded entity that would combine Sprint and Charter and be controlled by Japan\u2019s             SoftBank Group Corp.        9984 -2.29%      , the people said. SoftBank, whose chairman is also Mr. Son, already controls Sprint.It is far from guaranteed that Charter would ultimately agree to such a deal, and pulling one off would involve a high degree of difficulty.Should Mr. Son manage to succeed, the deal would be big: Sprint has a market value of $33 billion and about that much in net debt.\u00a0Charter has a market value of nearly $100 billion after swallowing Time Warner Cable Inc. last year and more than $60 billion of net debt.The resale deal the cable companies have been discussing, which could have included an agreement to invest in Sprint\u2019s network and possibly buy a stake in the wireless carrier,\u00a0appears to have taken a back seat to the merger talks. It is still possible, however, that there could be a resale deal with Sprint instead of any full-blown merger.Before embarking on the resale talks, Sprint had been discussing a possible merger with rival             T-Mobile US Inc.,       an effort that could now be rekindled alongside the Sprint-Charter talks, the people said. Even if Sprint and Charter did strike a merger or resale deal, it wouldn\u2019t preclude a subsequent tie-up between the new group and T-Mobile, one person said.When The Wall Street Journal first reported on the talks between Sprint and the cable companies, people familiar with the matter said they also included the possibility that Charter and Comcast would together acquire the wireless carrier.       John Malone,        whose             Liberty Broadband\u00a0Corp.       is Charter\u2019s largest investor, had been trying to convince Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts that the companies should jointly buy a wireless carrier, people familiar with the matter have said.But Mr. Roberts has been reluctant and made comments on an earnings call this week that played down the possibility that Comcast would participate in any big wireless merger.\u00a0\u201cWe really feel we\u2019re not missing anything,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cNo disrespect to wireless. It\u2019s a tough business.\u201dAs part of the deliberations, Mr. Son recently sought an investment in Sprint that could total more than $10 billion from billionaire investor             Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,       the Journal has reported. It isn\u2019t clear where that effort stands, though one person said Mr. Son would need to corral such an investment\u2014if not from Mr. Buffett than from someone else\u2014for his current Charter bid to succeed.Charter and Comcast, the two largest U.S. cable companies by subscribers, in May agreed to a partnership that barred either company from doing a wireless deal without the other\u2019s blessing or participation for a year. Charter would therefore need Comcast\u2019s approval for any merger with Sprint.The backdrop of all the discussions is the convergence of the cable and wireless industries as smartphones become increasingly important and consumers rely more equally on cable and wireless companies to surf the web and watch videos.Combining with Sprint could help Charter retain customers and fend off threats from cord-cutting and new rivals like             Netflix\u00a0Inc.       The idea is that adding mobile-phone service to bundles of TV, phone and broadband internet service would make the offerings more essential and cost-efficient.A Sprint-Charter tie-up would follow another proposed combination between media and telecommunications titans: the roughly $85 billion marriage of             AT&T Inc.       and             Time Warner Inc.,       which has prompted companies across both industries to rethink their positioning and consider deals.Meanwhile, wireless companies are engaged in a fierce price war in a saturated market that is quickly eroding revenue. Unlike             Verizon Communications Inc.       and AT&T,\u00a0Sprint doesn\u2019t have an extensive consumer wired network, so combining with Charter could help speed the construction of next-generation, or 5G, wireless-internet connections.Sprint reports its fiscal first-quarter earnings Tuesday and is expected to be grilled by analysts on its strategic options.Write to Ryan Knutson at ryan.knutson@wsj.com and Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.comAppeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'Sprint Seeks Deal With Charter.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sprint-proposes-merger-with-charter-communications-1501284899", "keywords": [" charter communications, communications giant, masayoshi son, media merger,sprint,Charter Communications ,CHTR,Comcast,CMCSA,SoftBank Group,9984.TO,JP:9984,Sprint,S,Masayoshi Son,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,marketing,markets,corporate actions,branding,corporate,industrial news,generic products,telecommunication services,diversified holding companies,broadcasting,cable broadcasting,business,consumer services,media,entertainment"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 20:10:00", "news_title": "Toshiba Agrees to Provide Notice to Western Digital in Chip-Unit Sale ", "content": "Toshiba Corp.

Western Digital says it has the right to veto any sale under its contracts with Toshiba, while Toshiba says no such right exists.

By Friday morning, that plan had fallen apart after a surprise defection of Republican senator       John McCain.President       Donald Trump       came under swift pressure from conservative activists to force action by withdrawing federal funding for the already rickety insurance markets.But other Republicans and Democrats suggested different approaches, prolonging the unpredictability that has created a tricky landscape for insurers.Insurers had been pressing for legislation aimed at stabilizing the marketplaces, an idea that is likely to now move into the spotlight. But it isn\u2019t clear that any bill can move forward fast enough to affect the markets for next year, as insurers must file rates by mid-August and make final decisions about participation by late September.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.\u201cWe really are right now up against it, as far as the deadline is concerned,\u201d said Gary Cohen, a vice president at Blue Shield of California. Even if lawmakers from both parties work to pull together a bill to bolster the exchanges, \u201cmy concern is that for 2018, it\u2019s going to be too late.\u201dMr. Trump signaled in an overnight tweet and remarks at a law enforcement event on Long Island Friday that he was open to seeing the markets fail. \u201cI said from the beginning: Let Obamacare implode, and then do it. I turned out to be right. Let Obamacare implode,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The president has on occasion publicly mulled cutting off monthly payments to insurers, which next come due in three weeks. Other administration officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary       Tom Price,        have said they are open to using executive action to loosen ACA rules, which could include relaxing the requirement that most people have insurance or pay a penalty.For the skittish insurance industry, the sheer range of possibilities comes at a sensitive time. Insurers are on the cusp of making decisions about their prices and participation in states\u2019 individual insurance markets next year.\u201cWe\u2019re worried,\u201d said Martin Hickey, chief executive of New Mexico Health Connections, a nonprofit insurer. \u201cWe need answers very soon to make good, responsible decisions\u2026. You can\u2019t have functioning markets in uncertainty.\u201dSome Republicans suggested pivoting to bipartisan legislation that would fund the insurer payments and shore up the insurance markets. Other GOP lawmakers said they weren\u2019t giving up the repeal effort yet, even as Democratic supporters of the ACA cheered themselves for having saved the health law again.\u201cLast night\u2019s horrific failure is not the final chapter in the debate,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\u201cI know that the president and vice president have spent most of the morning reaching out to senators on possible ideas that could gain the support of a majority of the upper chamber,\u201d Mr. Meadows said. \u201cThey are encouraging a number of key negotiators to stay involved in these first few weeks of August.\u201dThe White House said South Carolina Republican Sen.       Lindsey Graham       had visited with the president Friday but didn\u2019t confirm other meetings or calls.The political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation said the Trump administration should stop making \u201ccost-sharing reduction\u201d payments, which reimburse insurers for lowering copays and deductibles for millions of low-income people who get coverage under the ACA.Those payments have been challenged in court by House Republicans, who argue the funds were never authorized by Congress. A federal judge has sided with the House but allowed the payments to continue until the litigation concludes.\u201cThe administration should certainly make clear that they\u2019re not interested in throwing more money at Obamacare,\u201d said Dan Holler, a spokesman for the Heritage Foundation\u2019s political arm, Heritage Action.Insurers say the loss of the cost-sharing payments would push up rates and convince more companies to exit from the markets where consumers buy subsidized coverage under the ACA. Already, several insurers have cited the uncertainty in announcing pullbacks for next year, while others have already built extra cushions into their 2018 rate requests.More insurers have been raising red flags in recent days, including             Anthem Inc.,       which said Wednesday that if it doesn\u2019t quickly get more certainty about the future of the individual insurance market, it would likely further pull back its planned participation for next year.Some conservatives warned of risks to the Trump administration if it sought to undermine the markets.\u201cNo one with a sense of political realism would think that\u2019s even a good desperation move,\u201d said       Tom Miller,        a scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s not even leverage for anything, it\u2019s just pure wreckage.\u201dThe Department of Health and Human Services, meanwhile, could take administrative steps to peel back enforcement of the ACA requirement that most people obtain insurance or pay a penalty, a shift that insurers say would also push up premiums.Rep. Michael Burgess (R., Texas) said the prospect of the individual mandate\u2019s disappearance had brought insurers to his office Thursday to discuss offering products that would appeal to healthy customers buying them voluntarily.Mr. Burgess has said he is open to the Trump administration using executive action where it can, but said Friday he didn\u2019t want to see steps taken on the individual mandate in that way now.\u201cPeople need the certainty of settled law,\u201d Mr. Burgess said. \u201cThere are some temporary things that could be done by the administration, but realistically\u201d significant actions need to be taken by Congress.Some Republicans on Friday stepped up their pursuit of bipartisan legislation to prop up insurers in the short term.Sen.       Lamar Alexander       (R., Tenn.), who chairs the Senate\u2019s health committee, is expected to hold hearings on stabilizing the individual insurance market.Senators are also considering including an appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments, along with other kinds of short-term stabilization funding, to a reauthorization of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which is popular with both parties.A group of House Democrats, with buy-in from several centrist Republicans in that chamber, has been working to circulate its own plan to address the fragile insurance markets. \u201cWhat I\u2019m talking about are incremental changes, that\u2019s true. But incrementalism is not a dirty word,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent (R., Pa.), a co-chair of the centrist Tuesday Group.In another overture to the GOP, the House Democrats are speaking with Sen.       Bill Cassidy       (R., La.) about establishing a system to automatically enroll people without insurance in plans that would be covered by federal subsidies.Rep. Ami Bera (D., Calif.), a member of the group, said Democrats wanted to create another tool to enroll people in health plans in case the administration stops enforcing the individual mandate.\u201cIf they\u2019re not going to [enforce it], we\u2019ve got to talk about how to get everyone enrolled,\u201d Mr. Bera said.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com, Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com and Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'Health Bill\u2019s Defeat Roils Insurers, Republicans.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-bills-defeat-roils-republicans-insurers-1501283190", "keywords": ["affordable care act,donald trump,health care overhaul,health insurance exchanges,republican party,Bill Cassidy,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 19:04:00", "news_title": "One Dead in Hamburg Stabbing Attack ", "content": "BERLIN\u2014A rejected asylum applicant from the United Arab Emirates killed one person and injured six others in a stabbing rampage at a Hamburg supermarket on Friday, officials said, an attack that could reignite debate over security and immigration as the German election approaches.The 26-year-old suspect, whose identity wasn\u2019t released, couldn\u2019t be deported because he lacked identity papers, Hamburg Mayor       Olaf Scholz       said in a statement late Friday.\u201cIt further makes me angry that the attacker appeared to be someone who sought protection among us in Germany and then turned his hatred against us,\u201d Mr. Scholz said. \u201cThis shows how urgently the legal and practical obstacles to deportation must be removed.\u201dThe attack began in a supermarket in the Barmbek section of northeast Hamburg, where the suspect stabbed a 50-year-old German man to death with a large knife, police said. The attacker injured five others, at least some of them as he fled, and a 35-year-old Turkish bystander suffered injuries as he subdued the attacker before authorities arrived.The attacker yelled \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d\u2014Arabic for \u201cGod is great\u201d\u2014according to one witness interviewed by Germany\u2019s N-TV television and another whose interview with reporters on the scene circulated in a video on social media.A Hamburg police spokeswoman said she couldn\u2019t confirm the \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d exclamation or that the attack was ideologically motivated. \u201cWe are investigating in all directions,\u201d she said.But the revelation that a rejected asylum applicant appeared to have carried out the attack had the potential to revive Germany\u2019s immigration debate\u2014an issue that has largely faded into the background even as the Sept. 24 national election approaches. Ever since the influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants to Germany two years ago, Chancellor       Angela Merkel       has pushed to tighten asylum laws, speed deportations and negotiated with Turkey and north African countries to reduce the number of migrants who reach Europe\u2019s shores.While several hundred asylum applicants are still crossing into Germany daily, officials say, those numbers are a far cry from the thousands a day seen in 2015. Germany hasn\u2019t had a terrorist attack since last December, when an Islamic State supporter drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, leaving 12 dead.The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party, which is hoping to win seats in federal parliament for the first time, claims that Ms. Merkel\u2019s policies on migration and deportation are too lax. Support for the party has dropped into the single digits from around 15% in the wake of the Christmas market attack, and Ms. Merkel has appeared to be on course to easily win a fourth term.The repatriation of rejected asylum applicants continues to vex German security officials. Migrants generally can only be deported to their countries of origin if they have papers, and German officials say that some countries have been dragging their feet in issuing documents to citizens of theirs who came to Germany seeking refugee status.For example, Anis Amri, the suspect in the Berlin Christmas market incident, had been temporarily detained months before he carried out the truck attack because he was flagged for deportation. But his native Tunisia didn\u2019t immediately agree to take him back and was slow to issue the papers necessary for him to be deported, according to German officials.Write to Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.comAppeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'Asylum Seeker in Hamburg Kills Man.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/one-dead-in-hamburg-germany-stabbing-attack-1501268300", "keywords": [" barmbek, germany,hamburg attack, hamburg stabbing attack, hamburg supermarket attack, hamburg terrorist attack,injured,uae,political,general news,crime,legal action,migration,rampage,serial killings,murder,manslaughter,politics,international relations"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 18:56:00", "news_title": "White House Tailors Jobs Message to Its Base in Rust Belt ", "content": "When President       Donald Trump       wanted to give a speech earlier this month outlining a major infrastructure overhaul, he went to Cincinnati and the banks of the Ohio River. In recent interviews and tweets, Mr. Trump has celebrated             Ford Motor Co.\u2019s       reinvestment in a Michigan car plant and the opening of a Pennsylvania coal mine.In all of those instances, the president is talking up positive economic news in the states that form the backbone of his political coalition and are key to keeping his base intact amid his turbulent first six months in office.This week\u2019s announcement that the Chinese iPhone manufacturer Foxconn Technologies has committed to building a $10 billion plant continued the pattern. It was delivered in Wisconsin, a Democratic stronghold for three decades where Mr. Trump bulldozed through       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       firewall on Election Night.\u201cYou look at Wisconsin, [and Mr. Trump] winning by 22,000 votes last year, the first time it went Republican since 1984\u2014I pay attention to those things,\u201d said Bill Stepien, the White House\u2019s political director. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled they picked Wisconsin.\u201dThe Foxconn plant, which isn\u2019t scheduled to open until 2020, will initially employ 3,000 and may create an additional 22,000 related jobs in the future\u2014but the deal doesn\u2019t come cheap for Wisconsin taxpayers, given the $3 billion in state tax credits the company will receive. Gov. Scott Walker on Friday called a special legislative session next week focused on the incentive package.The package awarded is reminiscent of the deal Mr. Trump and Vice President       Mike Pence       helped engineer during the transition period when Indiana offered Carrier             United Technologies                   $7 million in tax incentives to keep 1,069 jobs at its factory in Indianapolis.Some independent analysts see a White House approach to job creation that is more a matter of public optics than smart or sustainable economic policy.\u201cThe White House calling out Carrier and other employers is more about public relations than great economic impact,\u201d said Adam Kamins, senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, who noted: \u201cThe amount of taxpayer money being thrown at these firms to attract them to certain states is pretty exorbitant. That creates a high bar in terms of the number of jobs that need to be created for the investment to pay off.\u201dThe administration\u2019s moves come against the backdrop of an economy that is growing steadily but not spectacularly. The \u00a0U.S. economy expanded at about 2% annual pace in the first half of 2017, essentially matching the average rate since the recession ended in 2009.Through the first half of this year, the economy added 1.08 million jobs, just 2,000 below the total of the first 6 months of 2016. The steady gains beat the forecasts of many economists who had expected employers to slow the pace of hiring as the labor market became tighter and wages rose. Still, it was the smallest number of jobs added in the first half of a year since 2010.June\u2019s unemployment rate was 4.4%, a slight uptick from the 4.3% May reading, which was the lowest rate since 2001.Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t shy away from framing economic data in terms that are favorable to him. The president during a speech to the National Scout Jamboree\u00a0Monday\u00a0talked up \u201cthe best jobs report\u00a0in 16 years,\u201d even though June\u2019s 222,000 new jobs amounted to the 52nd best month in terms of job growth in the last 16 years.The White House\u2019s particular focus is on manufacturing activity, which Mr. Trump has promised to revive. That sector has grown by 53,000 jobs during the first half of 2017. The gain is an improvement from the first half of 2016, when it declined by 12,000, but is broadly in line with the modest gains recorded for the sector since 2011.\u201cThe survey-based data shows manufacturers are very optimistic, but in terms of hiring, there\u2019s not been much of a change,\u201d Mr. Kamins said.While Mr. Trump has prodded and praised individual companies, Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, said passage of a tax-overhaul bill and an infrastructure spending package would do more to spark economic growth and hiring among manufacturers.\u201cThe numbers are now trending in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as strong as we\u2019d like to see.\u201dNotwithstanding the economic reality, Mr. Trump\u2019s team points to private polling that shows the president\u2019s positive economic messaging connecting with voters in critical swing states.In Wisconsin, a survey of voters conducted two weeks ago and shared by an administration official with The Wall Street Journal showed that 57% of residents believe more jobs are being created now than a year ago, compared to just 34% who disagree\u2014a 24-point net positive spread.Similarly, a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of counties Mr. Trump carried in last year\u2019s election found that residents there cited the president\u2019s bargaining with companies to keep jobs in America as the action Mr. Trump has taken that they most strongly support.\u201cA lot of this is a feeling of hope and optimism,\u201d Mr. Stepien said. \u201cOne of the reasons the president won last year is he gave hope to people who haven\u2019t had it in a long time, people who feel like they have been passed over for jobs.\u201dIn Wisconsin, the optimism isn\u2019t unwarranted.The state added 3,600 manufacturing jobs during the first six months of this year, the 10-best total gain among states. Manufacturing employment in the state accelerated this year after mostly plateauing since early 2014. The sector grew this year at a similar pace as overall job creation in the state.In other critical Trump states, the economic data is mixed.Michigan showed an even larger increase in manufacturing jobs than Wisconsin, but the 4,000 positions added in the first six months of 2017 are fewer than the 5,400 added to the state\u2019s economy over the same period a year ago.Pennsylvania lost 11,200 manufacturing jobs so far this year, the most of any state. Employment in the sector also fell in Ohio.\u201cI hear we\u2019re doing better in the polls, even right now, than we were even on election night, in so many different places\u2014swing states, etc.\u2014because they see what we\u2019re doing with jobs,\u201d Mr. Trump told supporters at a rally in Youngstown, Ohio,\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0night. \u201cThe jobs are the best they\u2019ve been\u00a0in 17 years.\u201dWrite to Eli Stokols at eli.stokols@wsj.com and Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.comAppeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'President Tailors Jobs Message to Rust Belt.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-tailors-jobs-message-to-its-base-in-rust-belt-1501282569", "keywords": ["donald trump,economy,foxconn,jobs,michigan,ohio,pennsylvania,wisconsin,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 18:53:00", "news_title": "CBS Adds Redstone\u2019s Lawyer to Board of Directors ", "content": "CBS Corp.

Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska,       Susan Collins       of Maine and       John McCain       of Arizona instead tapped into their strong political brands in their home states when they joined Democratic senators in blocking a slimmed-down Senate repeal measure, effectively ending the GOP repeal push for now.The 49-51 defeat cut off Republicans from fulfilling a longtime campaign promise to dismantle the 2010 health-care law. And it exposed the difficulty Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and Mr. Trump could face in the coming push to rewrite the U.S. tax code, as they can only afford to lose two GOP votes. Vice President       Mike Pence       holds the tiebreaking vote in the case of a 50-50 deadlock.Many Republicans and conservatives criticized the three defectors Friday, depicting them as rogue lawmakers who went back on their word and prevented the party from reaching a long-sought goal.\u201cI am deeply disappointed in the handful of Republican Senators who are the reason for this unacceptable outcome\u2014many of whom claimed they supported eliminating this flawed law,\u201d said Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas).But ACA supporters praised the senators as independent-minded and true to their principles. All three have strong political identities and histories of dissenting from party orthodoxy.Ms. Murkowski had indicated from the start of the health-care debate that she had concerns with the GOP approach. As a defender of Planned Parenthood, she opposed stripping funds for the women\u2019s health organization, and she objected to the bill\u2019s cuts to federal funding for Medicaid, which Alaska expanded under the ACA.As Friday\u2019s vote approached, the Trump administration turned up the pressure on Ms. Murkowski, especially after she voted Tuesday against a Senate procedural motion to begin debate on the health bill.\u201cSenator @lisamurkowski of the Great State of Alaska really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Too bad!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on his Twitter account Wednesday.Ms. Murkowski has been willing for years to operate independently of the GOP. In 2010, after losing the GOP primary to a Tea Party candidate, she was re-elected with an unusual write-in campaign. She was re-elected in 2016, meaning she doesn\u2019t face re-election until 2022.After the vote, Ms. Murkowski, like her fellow holdouts, suggested neither party had acquitted itself well in the health-care debate. \u201cI voted \u2018no\u2019 on the health care proposal last night because both sides must do better on process and substance,\u201d she said.Ms. Collins has also had significant electoral success, winning re-election in 2014 with more than 68% of the vote, and she has said she is considering running for Maine governor.Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski, two of five women GOP senators, received pointed criticism on Capitol Hill for their high-profile role in the health-care debate. Rep.       Blake Farenthold       (R., Texas) suggested he would challenge them to a duel were they men from Texas.\u201cThere are some female senators from the Northeast,\u201d Mr. Farenthold said on a Texas radio station last week. \u201cIf it were a guy from South Texas, I might ask him to step outside and settle this       Aaron Burr       style,\u201d he said, referring to the vice president who fatally shot       Alexander Hamilton       in 1804.Mr. Farenthold later said his comments were \u201cclearly tongue-in-cheek.\u201dMs. Collins, long known as the Senate\u2019s most centrist Republican, voiced concerns similar to those of Ms. Murkowski about the Senate legislation. She came out against the Senate GOP bill hours after the first analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated it would leave 22 million more people uninsured than the ACA.Her early opposition signaled she would not easily be flipped and White House officials and GOP leaders expended less energy trying to do so. Even in the midst of the GOP push, Ms. Collins met with Democrats to discuss potential bipartisan proposals.\u201cNeither party has a monopoly on good ideas, and we must work together to put together a bipartisan bill that fixes the flaws in the ACA and works for all Americans,\u201d she said in a statement explaining her Friday vote.Mr. McCain, recently diagnosed with brain cancer, returned to Washington on Tuesday, receiving a standing ovation as he entered the Senate floor and cast a vote to allow the Senate to begin debate on health care. He followed that with a speech lamenting what he called the Republicans\u2019 one-sided process to the health-care debate.\u201cLet\u2019s trust each other,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.\u201dIn his long career, Mr. McCain established a political identity as an independent-minded voice, especially during his initial campaign for president in 2000. His recent actions in some ways mirrored those of his friend, the late Sen.       Edward Kennedy       (D., Mass.), seven years earlier at a similar point in the debate over the ACA.Mr. Kennedy, too, was diagnosed with brain cancer and returned at a during the debate. But he supported his party\u2019s health-care push, while Mr. McCain, in the end, opposed it.After casting her vote early Friday morning, Ms. Collins hopped on a plane to return home. When she arrived back at the Bangor, Maine, airport at noon on Friday, according to one witness, she was greeted with applause as she walked through the waiting area.Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'Three Senators Show Challenge Ahead for Republicans.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/three-republican-senators-look-to-clout-in-home-states-to-end-health-care-repeal-1501282000", "keywords": ["affordable care act,affordable care act repeal,centrists,health care overhaul,health care reform,mavericks,obamacare,republican senators,senate,John McCain,Lisa Murkowski,Susan Collins,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,elections,upper house,welfare,social services,health care,life sciences"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 18:27:00", "news_title": "The Agony of Venezuela", "content": "Three more Venezuelans were killed Wednesday in protests against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s plan for elections Sunday for an assembly that will rewrite the constitution.

But then that\u2019s what       Anthony Scaramucci       was supposed to do for the communications team, only to blow up in adolescent fashion this week by trashing Mr. Priebus and others in public. White House leakers then let it be known that Mr. Trump liked Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s X-rated rant.The reason Mr. Priebus wasn\u2019t as effective as he could have been is because Mr. Trump wouldn\u2019t listen to him and wouldn\u2019t let him establish a normal decision-making process. Mr. Trump has a soft spot for military men so perhaps he\u2019ll listen more to Mr. Kelly.

This is a historic debacle that will echo politically for years.A divided GOP Senate could not muster a majority even for a simple bill repealing the individual and employer mandates they had long opposed. Nor were they able to repeal the medical-device tax that some 70 Senators had gone on record wanting to repeal in previous Congresses.The so-called skinny bill that failed in the Senate would have gone to a conference with the House, which had signaled its willingness to work out a compromise. That arduous process is the way the American legislative system works. A strong majority of the GOP caucuses on both chambers supported the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare, but that was undone by an intransigent and petulant minority.Where to begin in comprehending       John McCain\u2019s       last-minute defection? Early Friday morning Senator McCain turned his thumb down on the bill, which doomed this long effort. Explaining that vote, Mr. McCain said the bill \u201coffered no replacement to actually reform our health care system and deliver affordable, quality health care to our citizens.\u201d This is hard to credit, because his \u201cno\u201d has left the American people with ObamaCare in toto.On Thursday, with three other Senators, Mr. McCain said he wanted assurances that House Speaker       Paul Ryan       would negotiate in conference. Mr. Ryan said he would, and the other three voted yes. Senator McCain nonetheless chose to cast the decisive vote that broke the GOP promise.The Arizona Senator\u2019s politics has always been more personal than ideological. His baffling, 11th-hour vote makes us recall       Donald Trump\u2019s       infamous campaign slight about Mr. McCain\u2019s war imprisonment. Whatever his motives, the greater shame is that his vote keeps the edifice of ObamaCare in place with all of its harm to patients, the health-care system and the national fisc.There were many other contributors to this debacle. The Freedom Caucus dragged out the process in the House, which created time for opposition to build. Alaska Senator       Lisa Murkowski       betrayed her many previous votes and public statements. Two GOP Governors, Ohio\u2019s John Kasich and Nevada\u2019s Brian Sandoval, grandiloquently assaulted the bill for their own political gain, which made life difficult for their states\u2019 Senators, Rob Portman and Dean Heller.The Senate\u2019s GOP moderates conspired to kill both a historic Medicaid reform and repeal of ObamaCare\u2019s myriad taxes. Senators       Rand Paul       and Mike Lee worked to defeat Majority Leader       Mitch McConnell\u2019s       compromise draft to no good end. We cannot recall a similar effort by so many to subject their own party to such an abject public humiliation.Mr. Trump in a tweet blamed the three GOP Senators who voted no, but he was also an architect of his own defeat. Mr. Trump was elected in no small part on his promise to do big deals like this one. In the end he couldn\u2019t close. He never tried to sell the policy to the American public, in part because he knows nothing about health care and couldn\u2019t bother to learn.His chaos theory of White House management, on morbid public display this week, also means no one on Capitol Hill knows who is in charge. As his approval rating sinks below 40%, few in politics fear him and increasingly few will step forward to defend him.What next? The Senate failure has burned the reconciliation process available from last year and thus the ability to pass anything with 50 votes. The next reconciliation bill is earmarked for tax reform, if the hapless GOP can first pass a budget outline. Meanwhile, the ObamaCare exchanges will continue to deteriorate. This means the Trump Administration will face a choice of how much money to spend to keep some of them from collapsing. HHS Secretary       Tom Price       can give insurers more flexibility, but premiums will keep rising while choices for consumers decline.The Republicans who did so much to kill repeal and replace will now clamor for bipartisan action. And it would be nice to think Democrats would meet Mitch McConnell halfway. But Democratic leader Chuck Schumer knows he has Republicans on the run, and his price for 60 votes will be a costly bailout of ObamaCare, which liberal health-care academics are already proposing. Good luck repealing the law\u2019s mandates and taxes, or deregulating insurance markets.Mr. Schumer knows that a \u201cbipartisan\u201d Senate insurance bailout will further divide the GOP and put the House on the spot if it fails to go along. With the House majority in jeopardy in 2018, Speaker Ryan could face an excruciating choice: Attempt to save the seats of his party\u2019s moderates by voting with Democrats to bail out the exchanges, or get blamed by Democrats and the press for all of ObamaCare\u2019s ills.Republicans will now try to salvage what is left of this Congress with tax reform. But the tragedy remains: Republicans in their selfish political and personal interests squandered a once in a generation chance to show that their principles can make life better for Americans.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-republican-obamacare-crack-up-1501280459", "keywords": ["political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,commentaries,opinions,editorials,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 18:15:00", "news_title": "Illinois Convention Center Project Enters Prearranged Bankruptcy   ", "content": "A Chicago suburb\u2019s convention center project corporation entered chapter 11 bankruptcy on Friday, starting a court-supervised process to settle a $183 million municipal default.Lombard Public Facilities Corp., a public financing entity in the village of Lombard, Ill., entered court protection having already hammered out a restructuring deal with its largest creditors, municipal bond giants Nuveen Asset Management LLC and OppenheimerFunds Inc.The corporation\u2019s $183 million in debt was issued to finance an 18-story building project that opened in 2007 with a Westin-branded hotel, convention space and restaurants.The catalyst for the bankruptcy was the village\u2019s refusal, starting in late 2011, to appropriate funds to cover shortfalls between what the project generated in revenue and the scheduled payments due to bondholders.Reserve funds covered LPFC\u2019s debt obligations until January 2014, when the municipal debt fell into default, trashing the credit ratings of both the village and the bond issuer.Counting accrued interest and principal, the outstanding balance has ballooned to $247 million, according to court documents.Under the restructuring deal, the village agreed to contribute $3 million to boost bondholder recoveries. It would also hand over the proceeds from a 1% increase in its restaurant tax that went into effect in January.Subject to court approval, the plan would restructure some bonds into senior and subordinate securities and extend debt maturities until as late as 2069. A $69.5 million slice of the debt would be extinguished.LPFC is required under the agreement to meet a series of milestones, such as filing a plan of reorganization by Sept. 29 and securing court approval for that plan by Dec. 15.

Commissioner       Scott Gottlieb       said the agency was taking steps to render cigarettes \u201cminimally addictive.\u201dPerhaps some users simply like their taste or the image cigarettes project, but nicotine\u2019s addictiveness is undoubtedly a big part of the appeal for a product that can cost upward of $12.00 a pack, faces sharp advertising restrictions and carries warnings of its deadly effects on each pack.Fretting about tobacco companies such as Altria,             Philip Morris International        PM -1.25%       and             British American Tobacco        BTI -3.88%       has proved costly in the past. The decadeslong public health battle against smoking has reduced per capita consumption of cigarettes in the U.S. by around 80%, but, paradoxically, the profitability of the business is near a peak both at home and abroad.This resilience is most remarkable considering the fact that excise taxes and other cost pressures as well as plain old price increases have pushed the price per pack to about four times what it was in cigarette smoking\u2019s U.S. heyday. An economist would say that the \u201cprice elasticity of demand\u201d is low for tobacco\u2014a trait usually shared by essential products, not discretionary ones. Addictiveness is key.There are caveats that might make an investor want to pounce once again on a spot of bad news. The measures may never be enacted due to effective lobbying or legal challenges or get watered-down. Even then, they may take some time, during which big tobacco will continue to rake in profits. Even then, many people will continue to smoke. Finally, as analysts at             Wells Fargo                   point out, the news could be \u201can opportunity for reduced risk products\u201d which can be quite profitable too.Curb your enthusiasm, though. Newer products introduced after August 2016 face scrutiny. Furthermore, back in 2003 when regulatory worries were last so acute about plain old cigarettes, Altria sported a dividend yield of over 5% and traded at less than 6 times trailing earnings. It recently sported a yield of barely 3% and a trailing P/E ratio around 28 times. Furthermore, 14 years ago domestic leader Altria had big exposure to international tobacco sales and to food. Those businesses now reside in Philip Morris International, Kraft Heinz and             Mondelez International.Famed value investor       Warren Buffett       often spoke of \u201ccigar butt\u201d stocks that looked bad due to a declining or threatened business but still had a few puffs left in them.

Now Islamabad\u2019s attention to that problem could be sapped by its own political crisis. The world\u2019s sixth-most populous country, Pakistan is also locked in a tense, nuclear-armed, standoff with another neighbor, India, with which Mr. Sharif had repeatedly called for making peace.The court disqualified Mr. Sharif, a third-time prime minister, for not being \u201chonest,\u201d a requirement for lawmakers under Pakistan\u2019s constitution. The court also ordered a corruption trial against Mr. Sharif, whose family is accused of amassing wealth through corrupt means and purchasing expensive overseas properties with that money. His daughter and preferred political heir, Maryam, and his two sons also face a corruption trial. So does the finance minister,       Ishaq Dar,        who has been caught up in the allegations as well.Mr. Sharif, who along with his family denies any wrongdoing, hasn\u2019t been convicted of any crime, and some of his supporters voiced defiance in the face of the court\u2019s action. \u201cJustice hasn\u2019t been done with us,\u201d said Khawaja Saad Rafique, the railways minister. \u201cNawaz Sharif will be more lethal now for the enemies of democracy.\u201dMr. Sharif\u2019s exit bolsters the electoral prospects for his main opponent, former cricket star and current member of parliament Imran Khan. Though Mr. Sharif\u2019s party is expected to name a new prime minister, the court\u2019s action effectively launched an early start to the campaign for an election expected next year.But with political parties, the military and an activist judiciary competing with one another for power, analysts said the prime minister\u2019s removal on nebulous grounds of dishonesty could further complicate Pakistan\u2019s efforts to consolidate democracy. Some lawyers criticized the court for not waiting for the outcome of the corruption case, instead ousting Mr. Sharif on moral grounds that courts\u2014perhaps in common interest with the military\u2014could use to unseat other lawmakers.\u201cTo strengthen institutions, you have to make sure you don\u2019t open Pandora\u2019s boxes in immature democracies,\u201d said Moeed Yusuf of the United States Institute of Peace, a Washington think tank. \u201cThe political class can discredit itself so much now, by going after each other\u2019s throats over the next year, that even the street would again start saying that this democratic system cannot deliver.\u201dNo prime minister in Pakistan has ever completed a full five-year term. Mr. Sharif\u2019s previous two tenures as prime minister, in the 1990s, were both cut short by military intervention. He was most recently elected in 2013.At times during its handling of the case, the court compared the Sharifs to the mafia depicted in the book \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d a parallel the family angrily rejected. The case centered on questions over how the family acquired four apartments in one of London\u2019s most upscale areas, offering views over the city\u2019s Hyde Park, where Mr. Sharif is said to like to walk.Mr. Sharif\u2019s party said he stepped down immediately following the court\u2019s judgment, but stressed he hadn\u2019t been found guilty of any act of corruption. Mr. Sharif\u2019s party, which has a majority in parliament, said it would complete his term through to June of next year, after which elections are due to be held.There is speculation Mr. Sharif\u2019s party could seek to replace him with his brother, Shehbaz, who is chief minister of Punjab province, the Sharifs\u2019 homebase. That appointment, however, would require an interim prime minister for some weeks as Shehbaz would have to be elected to the national parliament first.Washington, having supported military dictatorships in Pakistan in the past, has backed democracy here in recent years. Some U.S. officials believe strengthening civilian authority is the way to eventually rein in the Pakistani military, which Washington accuses of supporting jihadist groups as proxies, including the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Pakistani military denies the accusation.\u201cWhile some here in Washington will praise the Supreme Court\u2019s aggressive anticorruption agenda, the dramatic return of judicial activism in Pakistan has a dark side,\u201d said Joshua White, a former member of the National Security Council under the Obama administration. \u201cI expect it will spur greater political instability, further consolidate military power, and likely stall the government\u2019s modest economic reform efforts.\u201dAs the Trump administration considers sending thousands more troops to Afghanistan, Pakistan\u2019s role becomes all the more important.\u201cThis is an internal matter,\u201d a State Department spokeswoman said Friday, referring to the court\u2019s removal of Mr. Sharif. \u201cWe look forward to a smooth transition as Pakistan\u2019s parliament selects the next prime minister.\u201dThe case against Mr. Sharif sprang from the huge leak of documents from a Panamanian law firm last year known as the Panama Papers, which revealed the offshore holdings of people around the world. Documents showed London apartments registered in the name of Mr. Sharif\u2019s children. Mr. Sharif said the apartments were acquired as part of a settlement of an old family business deal with a Qatari prince, and belonged to his children, not him.During a court-ordered investigation into the London property, it was discovered that Mr. Sharif was chairman of a company in Dubai owned by his son, and was entitled to a salary that he says he never took. It was this role that the court referred to in disqualifying him as not honest, saying the post should have been declared in filings to stand for election in Pakistan, the salary being an asset whether it was paid out or not.Mr. Sharif\u2019s aides said it was unfair to punish him over money that he never received, unseating the country\u2019s leader over what they called a legal technicality.The investigation found that Mr. Sharif and his children weren\u2019t \u201cable to justify assets and the means of income.\u201d The probe also alleged that the family had provided fraudulent documents to the court. Mr. Sharif had denounced those findings as \u201cslander.\u201dThe requirement for lawmakers to be \u201chonest\u201d and \u201ctrustworthy\u201d was introduced into the constitution by the 1980s military dictatorship led by Zia-ul-Haq, an Islamic fundamentalist general.The opposition party led by Imran Khan brought the case against Mr. Sharif, saying that holding politicians accountable, including for their personal wealth, would strengthen democracy in Pakistan and clean up its politics.\u201cThis is a great day; it\u2019s just the beginning. The biggest robbers will be caught,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cThis verdict has strengthened democracy. It has furthered Pakistan\u2019s democratic evolution.\u201dMr. Sharif\u2019s aides say the military establishment was pushing the court behind the scenes, to prevent Mr. Sharif\u2019s re-election with another parliamentary majority. The armed forces reject the accusation. Mr. Sharif and the military have clashed repeatedly over the past four years, especially over his outreach to India.Mr. Sharif says Pakistan had stabilized under his government, with a pickup in economic growth, a buildup of infrastructure and a reduction in terrorism.\u2014Qasim Nauman contributed to this article.Write to Saeed Shah at saeed.shah@wsj.comAppeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'Pakistan Court Unseats Prime Minister.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pakistan-prime-minister-nawaz-sharif-ousted-over-panama-papers-case-1501227329", "keywords": [" pakistan corruption,pakistan political turmoil, pakistan prime minister, panama papers,Nawaz Sharif,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,elections,national,presidential elections,judicial branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 18:01:00", "news_title": "\u2018Embarrassing\u2019 Health-Bill Defeat Casts Doubt on GOP\u2019s Can-Do Pledge", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The collapse of Republicans\u2019 drive to repeal the Affordable Care Act is prompting a wave of GOP anger and anxiety across the country, as the defeat has widened divisions within the party and emboldened Democrats hoping for major gains in the 2018 midterm elections.The implosion of legislation to remake the U.S. health-care system has Republicans worried not just because they have failed to deliver on a marquee campaign pledge, but because it casts doubt on the broader promise to be a can-do governing party after years in the opposition.\u201cIt is embarrassing,\u201d said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. \u201cIt sends a message to the country that we are very good at complaining and being the party of opposition, but we haven\u2019t quite figured out how to govern.\u201dThe party splintered and turned on itself in the hours after the predawn Senate vote rejecting a last-ditch GOP health-care bill. House Republicans grumbled about their Senate counterparts. Conservatives complained about centrists who cast the deciding votes. And the chasm between congressional Republicans and President       Donald Trump,        who has threatened to help mount primary challenges to wayward Republicans, widened.\u201cThe anger is palpable,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, who said she got 200 emails from irate conservatives within hours of the vote.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge disappointment,\u201d said Rep. Richard Hudson (R., N.C.). \u201cHow dare these senators not deliver on the promise we all made, they all campaigned on. They can\u2019t stop now.\u201dBut many Republicans saw the Senate vote as the death knell for the party\u2019s seven-year-old promise to repeal the Obama-era health law. It was a triumph for the Democratic Party and the anti-Trump \u201cresistance\u201d movement, whose demonstrations supporting the Affordable Care Act at congressional town-hall meetings pressured Republicans and helped boost the public\u2019s once-tepid support for the law.\u201cPoliticians only see the light when the people turn up the heat,\u201d said Rep. Keith Ellison (D., Minn.), praising activists who organized against the GOP overhaul.Democrats in Congress now face the question of whether to work with Republicans on bipartisan legislation to fix looming problems of the Affordable Care Act. Efforts to strike a compromise with the GOP risk angering liberal activists who want far broader changes such as a \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d single-payer system.\u201cThe hunger from the base is to stop the worst, but then reach for the visionary change we need\u2014both on the substance and in order to inspire voters,\u201d said Anna Galland, executive director of the liberal group Moveon.org.But the bigger splits now are within the GOP. Mr. Trump said in a             Twitter                   message that Congress should now let the health-care system fall into disarray, and hope that will drive Democrats to compromise. Congressional Republicans aren\u2019t happy with that approach, and worry that the problems of the health-care system will weigh on their electoral prospects.Chris Wilson, a GOP pollster who advises Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, says that the party can\u2019t walk away from its promise to overhaul the health-care system.\u201cThe GOP base won\u2019t stand for being lied to for seven years,\u201d said Mr. Wilson. \u201cThe GOP has to do something that they can defend next fall. \u2018We tried and failed, now re-elect us\u2019 isn\u2019t going to work.\u201dThe seeds of future primary challenges were implicit in the angry response of conservative activists.\u201cRepublican moderates are the ones standing in the way of Obamacare repeal,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cIt is time to \u2018crush\u2019 the moderates and \u2018punch them in the nose,\u2019\u201d she said, quoting the words once used by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) about the Tea Party.Republican National Committee Chairwoman       Ronna McDaniel       invoked the big loss in a Friday fundraising email for the 2018 midterm elections. \u201cWe need to elect conservatives to the Senate who will SUPPORT President Trump,\u201d she said.Ken Blackwell,        an Ohio conservative activist who worked in the Trump transition team, said the health-care defeat puts a \u201chigher value\u201d on Congress quickly passing tax cuts, an issue more likely to unify the party. But he said that GOP effort will be hobbled by the intramural battles within the White House staff such as the rivalry between communications director       Anthony Scaramucci       and Reince Priebus, who was chief of staff until Mr. Trump intervened in the feud Friday and named Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to replace him.\u201cThe internecine skirmishes are not unique to this administration; they are just more drastic and more debilitating,\u201d Mr. Blackwell said. \u201cSomebody has to have a decisive win.

The agency\u00a0said it would begin shutting down the services for good at Sioux San next July.The IHS has faced mounting criticism from members of Congress and tribal leaders over conditions at its hospitals, which have been beset by unnecessary deaths, misdiagnoses and neglect,\u00a0according to public documents and numerous interviews by The Wall Street Journal.IHS had temporarily stopped offering emergency services at the Rapid City hospital last September following a May 2016 report by federal regulators that found dangerous problems there. But Friday\u2019s announcement both expands and makes permanent the closures.In one case cited by regulators at the hospital, a six-month-old baby with an upper respiratory virus was sent home from the emergency room without any medical history taken or laboratory tests conducted. When the baby\u2019s mother brought him back the next day, his conditioned having worsened, a provider found the baby\u00a0had been born about three months premature\u00a0and had experienced serious respiratory problems for months. The baby was transferred to a different facility and ended up suffering a seizure.In a statement, the IHS said it made the decision to permanently close the hospital\u2019s emergency room and inpatient departments because of the age of the facility and its close proximity to Rapid City Regional Hospital, a non-IHS medical center where patients can be diverted.The IHS said it would continue to offer nonemergency urgent care and outpatient services at Sioux San and had plans to build\u00a0an outpatient\u00a0health-care clinic to ultimately take the hospital\u2019s place.\u201cSioux San Hospital has a strong commitment to urgent care and we will continue to focus on improving patient care to meet the needs of our patients and to enhance their quality of care,\u201d said Jim Driving Hawk, the acting director of IHS\u2019s Great Plains service area.\u00a0\u201cBy providing the services the vast majority of our patients require, we will be able to serve those patient populations more efficiently and effectively.\u201dTribal leaders were taken aback by the announcement, noting that the IHS hospital in Rapid City served people from dozens of tribes who live in the area, which is close to several large reservations.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty significant decision about a major IHS facility, and there was no consultation with tribes,\u201d said       Jerilyn Church,        chief executive of the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen\u2019s Health Board.In its statement, the agency said it had consulted with tribal leaders about how best to serve patients in the area and on plans to build a new clinic.Willie Bear Shield, a tribal councilor with the Rosebud Sioux, said tribes in the Great Plains region had been working on plans to reopen the facility\u2019s emergency room and improve its inpatient capabilities\u2014but those plans were now uncertain.Mr. Bear Shield said the Rosebud tribe planned to push both members of Congress and the IHS to reverse the agency\u2019s decision to shut down the hospital\u2019s main services.Write to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.comAppeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'Cutbacks Planned For IHS Hospital.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/indian-health-service-to-close-more-services-at-south-dakota-hospital-1501279019", "keywords": ["closing permanently,er,ihs,indian health service,rapid city,sd,sioux san hospital,south dakota,Indian Health Service,political,general news,society,community,ethnic minorities,social issues,health care,life sciences,hospital care,healthcare provision"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 17:54:00", "news_title": "Europe\u2019s Investment Banks Suffer American Envy", "content": "Life isn\u2019t getting any easier for Europe\u2019s investment banks.A string of results on Friday showed they are falling further behind U.S. rivals in the key business of trading bonds and currencies, although some are doing better in equities. Low volatility at home and a lack of scale in the more active and profitable U.S. market are taking their toll.In investment banking, advising on deals and capital raising, Europeans are performing worse, too, with only UBS getting close to the revenue gains reported by the U.S. banks.The trouble for the Europeans is that the more money U.S. banks make in their domestic market, the more firepower they will have to deploy on winning business elsewhere. As banks like             Morgan Stanley                   and             Citigroupreturn to strength, the White House\u2019s deregulatory agenda for banks might give this extra impetus.Credit Suisse                   stood out as having a particularly rough second quarter, mainly due to a much worse performance in both equity and bond trading in Asia, a market on which it is pinning its turnaround story.Low volatility in currencies and weak activity among clients in interest-rate related trading hurt all banks. Only             Deutsche Bank,which reported Thursday, did marginally better than the U.S. average, although the German bank fell down on its equities business, which saw the biggest revenue fall among its peers.One bright spot for several banks was the business of funding equities trades for hedge funds, which makes Deutsche\u2019s major loss of ground there look doubly painful.             BNP Paribas                   appeared to benefit most from Deutsche\u2019s woes with its equities revenue up 24% from the second quarter of 2016 in dollar terms, although it said strong equity derivatives results were also a big part of that.BNP\u2019s revenue gains were far ahead of the pack.             Barclays                   and UBS both managed to do a little better than the U.S. average of a 1% increase. Barclays\u2019 equity revenue was up 4% in dollar terms and UBS\u2019s up 3%.There is a further threat to European banks in the form of planned changes to global capital rules that could increase equity requirements. This has become somewhat less of a concern since rule makers announced banks are likely to have up to 10 years to meet updated rules.Meanwhile, European banks\u2019 best hope is that U.S. regulators don\u2019t loosen the leash on American banks too much.

The program is set to run out of funding by Aug. 15.

The latest airline\u2019s decision further disconnects a nation mired in deadly civil unrest as countries around the region increase pressure on its authoritarian government.\u201cEvery day we\u2019re more and more isolated,\u201d said travel agent       Nelly Corral,        frustrated that prices for tickets to the U.S. with the few remaining carriers servicing Venezuela\u2014among them Panama\u2019s             Copa Holdings SA      \u2014have nearly quadrupled since Avianca\u2019s departure Thursday.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s total chaos,\u201d she said.An internal company memo seen by The Wall Street Journal said Avianca faced chronic problems with power outages that limit the use of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar International Airport\u2019s runway as well as \u201cpoor-quality fuel\u201d and inadequate jet refueling equipment. The company several months ago had stopped refueling in Venezuela or leaving aircraft there overnight, a person familiar with the company\u2019s operations said, citing security risks.The memo also noted concerns over airport technicians with expired licenses that are needed to handle plane equipment. Flights, it said, are often delayed for hours due to arbitrary inspections by the Venezuelan National Guard, which maintains security there.\u201cThis is reflected in the highest level of theft and irregular intervention into travelers\u2019 luggage,\u201d the memo said, adding that Avianca\u2019s crew has also been subjected to robbery and assault on a number of occasions in the crime-ridden capital.A spokeswoman for Venezuela\u2019s aviation authority couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.The suspension by Avianca, which according to FlightGlobal had the second-highest seat capacity among international carriers flying to Venezuela, sent the company scrambling to accommodate or reimburse thousands of passengers who had bought tickets through mid-August, when the company had initially planned to stop flights before accelerating its pullout.The lack of flights has also left Venezuelans stranded abroad and disrupted exit plans for the many looking to flee the country\u2019s collapsing economy and street violence fueled by daily demonstrations against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s autocratic rule.Other carriers are also eyeing the exit.             Delta Air Lines                   this week notified Venezuelan travel agencies that they would stop their once-weekly flight to the country on Sept. 16.\u00a0The company didn\u2019t return calls seeking comment.On Thursday, the U.S. State Department said it had ordered the evacuation of family members of embassy workers ahead of a vote organized by Mr. Maduro for Sunday to redraw the country\u2019s constitution. The controversial measure has heightened the risk of violent clashes in the polarized nation and has drawn swift condemnation from human-rights organizations and governments around the region. Mexico and Colombia this week followed the Trump administration\u2019s move to blacklist 13 Venezuelan government officials accused of corruption and rights abuses.Immigration authorities in Colombia and Peru on Friday announced plans to review visa statuses for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in their countries to allow for longer stays on humanitarian grounds.\u201cThe moment I saw the U.S. workers and the airlines leaving, that\u2019s when I really started worrying that it may be too late to get out,\u201d said 31-year-old Caracas political consultant       Marcela Zaro       who lost tickets for a planned trip to the U.S.Rigid currency controls in Venezuela haven\u2019t only made it hard for individuals like Ms. Zaro to access dollars to travel, but they have also prevented airlines from repatriating $3.8 billion in ticket sale revenues they have trapped in Venezuela, according to the\u00a0International Air Transport Association. The industry group says carriers are further squeezed because Venezuela\u2019s government forces them to pay for jet fuel in dollars, leaving them with few ways to spend the holdings they have locked in the local bolivar currency, whose value is in free fall.\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy what\u2019s happening in Venezuela,\u201d said IATA spokesman       Jason Sinclair.       \u201cGlobal economies need aviation and connectivity to run.

The so-called harm-reduction strategy is a break by the U.S. government from an abstinence-only approach to fighting tobacco-related diseases and deaths.Shares of major tobacco companies, which have been reaping growing profits in the U.S. market even as the number of smokers dwindles, tumbled Friday on the surprise move. Marlboro maker             Altria Group Inc.        MO -2.64%       fell 10%, while         British American Tobacco               PLC, maker of Camel cigarettes, dropped 8.5%, erasing tens of billions of market value.\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t just nicotine, the problem is the delivery mechanism,\u201d FDA Commissioner       Scott Gottlieb       said at a press conference Friday.\u201cCigarettes will likely remain incredibly toxic\u2026. We may be able to reach a day when the most harmful products will no longer be capable of addicting our children,\u201d he said.Dr. Gottlieb said the FDA\u2019s new approach would consider \u201ca continuum of risk for nicotine delivery,\u201d from combustible products such as cigarettes to replacement therapies like nicotine gums. Nicotine hooks people on cigarettes, but nicotine itself doesn\u2019t cause cancer, heart disease or lung disease, he noted. It is other harmful compounds in cigarette smoke that kill 480,000 people in the U.S. each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In addition to pursuing regulation to \u201crender cigarettes minimally addictive,\u201d Dr. Gottlieb said the FDA would consider a ban on menthol cigarettes.The announcement is the biggest step by the U.S. government to curb smoking since a landmark legal settlement in 1998. In addition to paying more than $100 billion to help states pay for health care, tobacco companies agreed to restrictions on the use of cartoons in marketing, as well as transit advertising, billboards and free product samples.\u201cThis is a huge switch from the \u2018tobacco-free world\u2019. approach to tobacco and nicotine by U.S. government agencies,\u201d said David Sweanor, a Canadian law professor and tobacco expert who supports the harm-reduction approach.The FDA began regulating the industry in 2009 but that move in some ways proved beneficial to Big Tobacco by grandfathering in cigarettes already on the market and eliminating regulatory uncertainty. The FDA\u2019s new stance \u201crepresents a paradigm shift in regulatory risk for U.S. tobacco companies,\u201d Stifel analyst Christopher Growe told clients in a note Friday.Altria, which supported the 2009 legislation that gave the FDA authority to reduce nicotine levels, said \u201cany proposed rule such as a nicotine product standard must be based on science and evidence, must not lead to unintended consequences and must be technically achievable.\u201dBAT\u2019s U.S. subsidiary Reynolds American, which also sells nicotine gum, e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, said: \u201cWe are well prepared and look forward to participating in a thorough process to develop a comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation.\u201dImperial Brands               PLC, which sells the Winston and Kool brands, said \u201cit\u2019s too early to understand the practical implications\u201d of the FDA\u2019s new position.             Philip Morris International Inc.,        PM -1.23%       which doesn\u2019t sell products in the U.S. but has applications pending before the FDA, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Some tobacco analysts were skeptical, saying such regulation would take years to develop and would likely be litigated. Others questioned the public-health benefit, suggesting smokers would just smoke more cigarettes to compensate for the lower levels of nicotine.Citigroup analyst Adam Spielman said he doesn\u2019t believe the FDA will be able to lower nicotine to nonaddictive levels because defining that level would be difficult and there would be political opposition. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe the proposal to reduce nicotine in cigarettes dramatically is practical,\u201d Mr. Spielman said.Nicotine levels in cigarettes can be reduced in different ways. Manufacturers can adjust the blend of tobacco leaves or use different types of paper or filters. Nicotine can also be stripped from the leaf in the manufacturing process.But products with very low levels of nicotine have never garnered a significant share of the U.S. market. In 1989, Philip Morris Cos., the company now known as Altria, introduced an ultralow-nicotine cigarette called Next De-Nic, created through a process that stripped the majority of the nicotine from the tobacco leaf similar to the way caffeine is removed from coffee beans.The FDA also said Friday it will allow more time for makers of e-cigarettes and vaping products to submit products for agency review. Those that were on the market in August 2016 won\u2019t be subject to review until 2021 or 2022.The FDA\u2019s shift comes as the agency considers whether to approve new health-related marketing claims for several cigarette alternatives. In April, Reynolds American submitted applications to market six styles of Camel Snus tobacco pouches as being less harmful than cigarettes. Philip Morris International also has a health-claim application pending for a new device that heats tobacco instead of burning it. Analysts said the FDA\u2019s new position could bode well for such products.\u2014Saabira Chaudhuri contributed to this articleWrite to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Shares of major tobacco companies tumbled on the move by the Food and Drug Administration.

Unfortunately cruise control is about 2%,\u201d said Diane Swonk, founder of DS Economics.The U.S. emerged from recession in mid-2009. Since then, GDP growth has averaged 2.1%. In contrast, growth averaged 3.6% during a 10-year span in the 1990s and 4.9% during a nearly nine-year stretch in the 1960s, the only two expansions with longer durations.Slow and steady has produced a long stretch of job creation and left the economy on mostly stable footing, with few signs of the kind of excess that in the past have derailed long periods of growth.In the 1960s, for example, runaway inflation led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and curtail growth. Today, broad measures of inflation are historically weak. The price index for personal-consumption expenditures\u2014the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge\u2014rose at an annual rate of 0.3% in the second quarter. That is well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.9% at an annual rate during the quarter.After the 1990s stock boom, a tech bubble burst, crashing markets and ultimately sending the economy into recession and an expansion that didn\u2019t produce many jobs. There are signs today that stocks are fully valued, one potential risk for investors. But the stock boom lacks the fervor of the 1990s, when outsize internet company valuations proved unsustainable.Absent such forces, underlying economic growth appears locked in for the foreseeable future, with both households and businesses helping to propel modest growth. Forecasts for the remainder of the year are mixed.             J.P. Morgan                   expects a second-half growth rate of 1.75%, NatWest Markets around 2.5% and Capital Economics 2.5% to 3.0%. The Federal Reserve in June estimated full-year GDP growth would register at 2.2%.Forecasters in The Wall Street Journal\u2019s July survey of economists pegged the odds of a recession at just 15%, little changed from last month and down 22% from a year ago.Against that backdrop, stocks and corporate profits are marching higher and volatility in markets is low. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is less than 200 points shy of the 22000 mark after rising 0.15% Friday 21830.31.On Friday, the biggest U.S. energy companies reported robust profits.             Exxon Mobil Corp.       nearly doubled its net income compared with a year ago and             Chevron Corp.       saw profits jump to $1.45 billion in the second quarter. Earlier in the week,             Caterpillar Inc.,       the world\u2019s largest heavy-machinery maker, delivered an upbeat earnings report amid growing demand in China\u2019s construction sector and a revitalization of the mining industry.\u201cThe outlook is that businesses and consumers are becoming more confident in the future,\u201d       Christopher Martin,        chairman and CEO of Jersey City, N.J.-based             Provident Financial Services,       told investors Friday. \u201cAnd notwithstanding the headlines from Washington and the partisanship in Congress, overall, we are bullish on the U.S. and our local economy and its potential for stronger growth.\u201dFriday\u2019s GDP report showed that consumer spending rose at a 2.8% pace, an improvement from the first quarter\u2019s 1.9% rate. Consumers stepped up spending on both goods and services, though there are signs households do have some concerns about the future.The University of Michigan on Friday said its final reading on overall consumer sentiment in July fell slightly from the prior month. An index that tracks expectations about the future declined to 80.5, its lowest level since last October. An index tracking confidence in the current economic situation jumped to 113.4, its highest level since July 2005 and the second-highest reading since November 2000.Businesses also have been upbeat. A measure of corporate spending, nonresidential fixed investment, climbed at a 5.2% pace. While that was down from the previous quarter, it is still one of the best readings since 2014. Investment in equipment was even stronger; it grew at 8.2% pace.Investment this year has been particularly strong in the energy sector. The number of oil and gas rigs in the U.S., a proxy for activity in the sector, is up by 44% to 958 since the start of the year, according to oil-field services company             Baker Hughes.Friday\u2019s GDP numbers showed that investment in mining exploration, shafts and wells more than doubled at an annual pace in the second quarter. Businesses also spent heavily on computers and industrial equipment in the second quarter, investments that could lift productivity and help further spur economic growth.And in a sign of an improving global economy, U.S. exports expanded faster than imports. That made trade a small contributor to overall growth after a long stretch of negative effects on output from 2014 to 2016. A weaker dollar may also be contributing to the export sector\u2019s improvement.Government outlays rose, led by a surge in federal military spending, while spending on home building and improvements was the biggest drag in the second quarter. Residential fixed investment dropped at a 6.8% pace, the sharpest decline since 2010.President       Donald Trump,        who took office in January, has pledged to return the nation to the above-3% growth by overhauling the tax and regulatory systems and negotiating better trade deals. There is little to suggest a breakout is imminent.\u201cIf a well-constructed tax reform deal is enacted this year or next, the economy may fire on all cylinders and accelerate to closer to President Trump\u2019s 3% goal,\u201d said       Stephen Stanley,        chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.

The case garnered international attention and offers of intercession from both U.S. President       Donald Trump       and the pope.The 11-month-old was thought to be one of 16 children in the world suffering from mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare and incurable genetic condition that rendered him unable to cry or to see, swallow, hear, move or breathe without assistance. Doctors felt that keeping him on a ventilator was causing him pain, but his parents were hopeful for a chance to help him improve.In the U.K., courts are tasked with protecting a child\u2019s rights, giving them the final say on the fate of grievously ill children and not the child\u2019s parents.Three different U.K. courts\u2014including the Supreme Court\u2014sided with Charlie\u2019s doctors, arguing that the experimental therapy would merely prolong the boy\u2019s suffering and that his life support should be withdrawn so he could die with dignity.

The couple had raised over $1.7 million to fund the cost of travel and treatment in the U.S.But they abandoned their fight Monday after new scans of Charlie\u2019s muscles revealed that the damage was much worse than feared, and that there was no meaningful prospect of the treatment working.\u201cAs Charlie\u2019s devoted and loving parents, we have decided that it\u2019s no longer in Charlie\u2019s best interests to pursue treatment and we will let our son go be with the angels,\u201d Ms. Yates said during the tearful court hearing. \u201cWe are so sorry that we couldn\u2019t save you,\u201d she added.Charlie\u2019s parents initially wanted to spend his last few days at home, but a judge ordered Thursday that he be taken to a hospice because the intensive care he needed wasn\u2019t possible at home.\u201cWe\u2019ve had no control over our son\u2019s life and no control over our son\u2019s death,\u201d Ms. Yates said Thursday.The hospital said it regretted that \u201cprofound and heartfelt differences between Charlie\u2019s doctors and his parents have had to be played out in court over such a protracted period.\u201d\u201cEveryone at Great Ormond Street Hospital sends their heartfelt condolences to Charlie\u2019s parents and loved-ones at this very sad time,\u201d it said in a statement Friday.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/charlie-gard-terminally-ill-child-at-center-of-u-k-court-debate-dies-1501264815", "keywords": ["british infant,charlie gard,charlie gard dies,charlie gard passes away,terminally ill british infant,Charlie Gard,Chris Gard,Connie Yates,political,general news,society,community,ethical issues,demographic health,health,infant,child,teenage health,social issues,medical treatments,procedures"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 16:46:00", "news_title": "U.S. Sanctions Six Entities Related to Iran\u2019s Ballistic-Missile Program   ", "content": "The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned six Iran-based entities that officials said Friday are central to Tehran\u2019s ballistic-missile program, a move coming one day after the country tested a rocket designed to carry a satellite.The Treasury, calling the rocket launch part of a broader series of provocations by Tehran, said the new measures target subsidiaries of Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group that make components, provide fuel, research and ground support for Iran\u2019s missile program.U.S. Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       said the sanctioned entities underscore the administration\u2019s concern over Iran\u2019s continued development and testing of ballistic missiles.\u201cThe U.S. government will continue to aggressively counter Iran\u2019s ballistic-missile-related activity, whether it be a provocative space launch, its development of threatening ballistic-missile systems, or likely support to Yemeni Houthi missile attacks on Saudi Arabia such as occurred this past weekend,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Attempts to reach Shahid Hemmat were unsuccessful. Iranian officials have defended recent rocket and missile launches, saying they don\u2019t violate the provisions of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, including the U.S.The text of the 2015 agreement makes no mention of missiles, although a United Nations Security Council resolution connected to its implementation called on Iran not to develop ballistic missiles designed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads.On Friday, before the announcement of new U.S. sanctions, Iranian Foreign Minister       Javad Zarif       wrote on his Twitter account that Iran doesn\u2019t develop such missiles, and has complied in good faith with both the letter and spirit of the nuclear deal.\u201cRhetoric and actions from the U.S. show bad faith,\u201d he wrote.The rocket launch came the same day the Senate voted 98-2 to approve a new package of sanctions targeting Iran, Russia and North Korea.

An Ohio officer also overdosed on fentanyl after responding to a traffic stop. And in Florida, three trained police dogs overdosed while searching a house with suspected narcotics. Law-enforcement officials worry that such risks will rise as fentanyl proliferates across the nation.Kevin Phillips,        a deputy sheriff in Harford County, Md., recently felt the drug\u2019s wrath when he responded to an increasingly routine call of drug overdose, opening a nightstand in the home while searching for heroin.\u201cAbout two or three seconds after I shut it, my face started burning. I broke out in a sweat,\u201d said Cpl. Phillips, who was rushed to the hospital for treatment after overdosing on fentanyl that had been mixed into the heroin.Authorities swiftly set a new policy: officers must treat drug seizures like an active shooter incident\u2014slow down and evaluate the scene before rushing inside. They must also wear protective gear.Law-enforcement encounters with fentanyl nationwide rose to more than 14,000 in 2015 from about 1,000 in 2013, according to federal data. Fentanyl, which is 50 times more powerful than heroin, has been used legally for decades, including as a painkiller for cancer patients. But in the past five years, illegal forms of the drug, often produced in China and Mexico, have quickly spread throughout the country and contributed to a broader opioid epidemic that has killed tens of thousands of people.Two to three milligrams of fentanyl\u2014the equivalent of five to seven grains of table salt\u2014is enough to cause respiratory depression, cardiac arrest or death, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which issued new guidelines for first responders in June. Overdosing can occur from inhaling or touching fentanyl, which drug dealers often mix with heroin because it is cheaper and has a higher potency.\u201c[Fentanyl] is a new challenge, a game changer for law enforcement,\u201d said Harford County Sheriff       Jeffrey Gahler.       \u201cIt could be anyone exposed.\u201dIt\u2019s not just humans at risk.While executing a narcotics search warrant in October, officers from Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office in Florida directed three trained dogs\u2014Primus, Finn and Packer\u2014to sniff around a house. The dogs soon became drowsy, found it difficult to stand and eventually adopted blank stares and became unable to move, said Det.       Andy Weiman,        the head dog trainer. The dogs, who were later found to have overdosed, were treated at an animal hospital and returned to work the next day, he said.Law-enforcement officials are swiftly overhauling their procedures for handling fentanyl and other forms of the drug.About a year ago, New York Police Department detectives routinely tested narcotics at a crime scene. Now, they wear protective gloves to package the drugs and drive it to a Queens laboratory to be tested. There, workers with white safety suits, respirator masks and the antidote naloxone stand by as an analyst tests the drug, which lies within a glass tank.NYPD officials estimate they will find fentanyl in more than 2,200 narcotics cases by the end of the year, up from nine cases in 2013, said Deputy Chief       Emanuel Katranakis,        head of the force\u2019s forensic investigations division. The NYPD recently began urging officers to request backup from specially trained units wearing safety gear if they suspect heroin is present.The Philadelphia Police Department is requiring officers to take a class on safety precautions for fentanyl and arming all officers with naloxone.In May, police officers in East Liverpool, Ohio, stopped a car because they suspected the occupants were selling drugs. When the officers approached, wearing gloves and masks, the car\u2019s occupants dispersed a white powder so the officers wouldn\u2019t find it.\u201cThey smashed it into the floor, into a pop can, anywhere they could hide it,\u201d said       Brian Allen,        the city\u2019s director of public safety and service.Later back at the police station, one of the officers,       Chris Green,        brushed powder off the back of his shirt and within minutes became faint and collapsed before being rushed to the emergency room. Subsequent testing showed the powder contained fentanyl. Officer Green recovered.Even some medical examiners, who investigate deaths, are using new protective measures like nitrile gloves and Tyvek suits in autopsy rooms and morgues to protect themselves from fentanyl because dead bodies could contain traces of the drug. The challenge is that dangerous substances can unknowingly be transported on a dead body, said a spokesman for the West Virginia medical examiner.Fears of unintentional overdose extend to prosecutors offices as well. Some are now hesitant to store evidence like cellphones or laptops in their offices, as they customarily do. Prosecutors also are introducing new policies to protect investigators and handle evidence.Ron O\u2019Brien,        prosecuting attorney of Franklin County, Ohio, said people on each floor of his office are trained to administer naloxone. \u201cWe have witnesses that show up in our lobby that may themselves be [drug] users,\u201d he added.Prosecutors are discussing how to keep fentanyl out of courtrooms. In typical cases, drugs like crack cocaine, heroin and marijuana are used as trial exhibits and wheeled into a courtroom on a dolly. Mr. O\u2019Brien said prosecutors are preparing for the inevitable questions over how to handle fentanyl in the courtroom, where he hopes it will be banned.\u201cYou can take as many precautions as you want, but it\u2019s still very dangerous stuff,\u201d he said.Bridget Brennan,        New York City\u2019s special narcotics prosecutor, said prosecutors in the city had discussed the logistical concerns of a fentanyl case going to trial. The judge would ultimately decide how to handle the evidence, she said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not sure anybody would want to sit in a courtroom with it, regardless.\u201dStill, some law-enforcement officials say these new policies and procedures conflict with the daily realities of their jobs.Undercover detectives can\u2019t ask a dealer to wait until they put on a nitrile glove before purchasing drugs, said Deputy Chief Katranakis of the NYPD. Sheriff Gahler, of Maryland, said safety procedures can only go so far for police aiming to save lives.\u201cIf someone is there not breathing,\u201d he added, \u201cno police officer I know is going to spend five minutes in the driveway putting on personal protective equipment.\u201dWrite to Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.com and Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.comAppeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'Police Confront Growing Peril: Fentanyl.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-american-scourge-fentanyl-is-now-stinging-law-enforcement-1501234203", "keywords": [" drug addiction, drug epidemic, drug scourge, illegal drugs, law enforcement and drugs,opiate abuse, opioids, police,drug,substance usage,political,general news,national,public security,society,community,crime,legal action,drug trafficking,dealing,law enforcement,medication abuse,misuse,social issues,trafficking,smuggling"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:48:00", "news_title": "Trump Eyes Columbia Professor for SEC Seat", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The White House is preparing to nominate Columbia University law professor Robert Jackson to a Democratic slot on the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the matter.The White House is currently vetting Mr. Jackson after he was recommended by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), these people said.The selection process isn\u2019t complete and could still change, one of the people said.A White House spokeswoman and Mr. Jackson didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Mr. Schumer declined to comment.The five-seat commission is required to have a partisan balance. Mr. Jackson\u2019s candidacy suggests the Trump administration is willing to defer to Senate Democratic leaders when filling regulatory seats reserved for Democrats. While that practice mirrors one adopted by the Obama administration\u2014which typically deferred to Senate Republicans for slots reserved for Republican individuals\u2014it was unclear if the Trump administration would continue that tradition for high-profile regulatory posts.If Mr. Jackson is nominated, Senate lawmakers would likely seek to speed up his confirmation by pairing him with       Hester Peirce,        a Republican tapped earlier this month to fill another SEC vacancy. Both would join an SEC down to just three members: Democrat       Kara Stein,        Republican Michael Piwowar, and       Jay Clayton,        the chairman, who is an independent.Mr. Jackson has written on securities topics such as executive compensation and corporate governance. In 2014, he helped uncover a flaw with the SEC\u2019s corporate-filing system that allowed hedge funds and other rapid-fire investors to gain access to certain market-moving documents ahead of other users of the system. The SEC pledged to correct the flaw.A 2015 research paper he co-wrote suggests corporate insiders might trade on material, nonpublic information before their companies are required to publicly report the information. He is also among a group of 10 academics to petition the SEC in 2011 to require public companies to disclose their political-spending activities.Mr. Jackson\u2019s effort to persuade the SEC to regulate corporate political spending is notable, because the issue helped torpedo a previous nominee for the same post. When the Obama administration nominated an academic for the same SEC slot in 2015, Senate Democrats, including Mr. Schumer, helped block her nomination when she didn\u2019t take a clear stand on the issue. Mr. Schumer said she was \u201cfence-sitting\u201d on whether public companies should have to disclose they money they give to political groups.Democrats believe more transparency could prompt some companies to spend less on politics if shareholders or other influential groups protest the giving. Still, the effort is unlikely to gain traction during the Trump administration.Republican officials generally oppose such a rule, saying the SEC shouldn\u2019t compel firms to report political donations because securities laws require companies to report only information that helps shareholders make investment decisions. Such judgments usually turn on a company\u2019s prospects for earning profits or cash flow, not whether a business has donated money to a politically active group, they say.\u2014       Dave Michaels       contributed to this article.Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-eyes-columbia-professor-for-sec-seat-1501271290", "keywords": ["robert jackson,sec,securities and exchange commission,Securities and Exchange Commission,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:43:00", "news_title": "Oil Gains on OPEC Cuts, Rising Demand", "content": "Oil prices rose every day this week, their best since December, as renewed optimism about falling supply and rising demand refuel a rally.U.S. crude is bumping up against $50 for the first time in almost two months, retracing about half of the ground it lost during an unexpected selloff that started in March. Traders and analysts had widely predicted a rally toward $60 in part from continued demand growth and a new deal from exporters to cut output; these same factors are pushing oil higher now, though several months later than many expected.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bullish factors for sure out here,\u201d said John Macaluso, trader at Tyche Capital Advisors LLC, which oversees $8 million in assets.

Brent crude, the global benchmark, gained $1.03, or 2%, to $52.52 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Both have had gains in 12 of the past 15 sessions, hitting their highest settlements since the last week of May.U.S. crude gained 8.6% and Brent gained 9.3% for the week. That is their biggest weekly gain since the week ended Dec. 2, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced a deal that would eventually include Russia and other major exporters and aim to cut output by around 1.8 million barrels a day.While that deal seemingly failed to ease a glut for most of the year, there are signs that is changing. U.S. inventories have now fallen in 14 of the last 16 weeks, sometimes dramatically. Lower imports into the country have played a role, with Saudi Arabia intentionally lowering its shipments to the U.S. Imports from Saudi Arabia to the U.S. are now at a two-year low, down by about a third since January, data-tracking firm ClipperData said Friday morning.\u201cIt\u2019s providing some confidence to the market they really mean business here at trying to whittle down these inventories and rebalance the market,\u201d said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.Demand also has been strong in the U.S. and abroad.

But demand has been strong, making him hesitant. And he is expecting another, unusual surge of gasoline demand from people in August going to see the first total solar eclipse in the continental U.S. since 1979.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a lot of people driving,\u201d Mr. Waggoner said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see bigger draws (from storage) like we saw this last week, and that\u2019s going to hold the price up.\u201dFriday\u2019s updated rig count from             Baker Hughes Inc.       showed just two new rigs drilling for oil.

When the phrase was introduced in the 18th century, literature was considered, at its best, beautiful. Devotees tried to emulate that beauty in their response to it.Modernism was a turning point, when literature became more alienated and combative with respect to society. American literature, with its muscular, democratic associations, contributed to the change. Belles lettres seemed too elitist, not to mention too French, to describe early-20th-century writing.The prestige of belles lettres was further impaired by the rise of science as civilization\u2019s potential savior. Science was necessary to defend democracy, first during World War II and then during the Cold War. Now, it is the means of moving ahead in a competitive, technological society. Who has time for beauty when there is serious work to be done?The death knell for belles lettres came with a 1959 lecture by the scientist and novelist       C.P. Snow,        \u201cThe Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution.\u201d Snow seemed to call for cooperation between science and the humanities, but he was really decrying the scientific illiteracy of writers and critics who, unlike him, didn\u2019t happen to be scientists as well. His lecture touched a nerve. It spoke to the insecurity of the humanist who wished to have the hard knowledge and social status of the scientist.The eminent literary critic       F.R. Leavis       delivered a rebuttal in 1962. He took issue with Snow\u2019s tone and sense of superiority. But his critique was not so much about Snow himself (though it was taken this way) as about the assumption that science and the humanities could be judged by the same standards. Literature, according to Levis, had a role in society that had no bearing on what science\u2014a focused, fact-based discipline\u2014could do.Leavis\u2019s argument met with mockery and abuse. It was labeled foolish, intemperate and overly personal\u2014which is to say original, emotional and subjective, the very qualities associated with the human condition that are central to the humanities.He had few supporters at the time, but he never retreated from his position\u2014and he turned out to be prescient. Snow\u2019s scientific bias has infected all humanities disciplines at all levels. We have seen the prestige of numbers and facts take precedence over imagination and discernment.The problem, as Leavis understood, is that science and the humanities are inherently incommensurate endeavors. Science builds on its discoveries. It moves forward, so that the past is the literal foundation for the present and future. Literature does not move forward in this way. Poets and writers may be influenced by their predecessors, but they do not have to be. One need not read       Shakespeare       to write a play or a poem. By the same token Shakespeare is as relevant today as he was when he wrote. That cannot be said of       Ptolemy.The simple truth that progress is central to science but not to the humanities is difficult to grasp for people who seek improvement in every walk of life. It fuels the drive to render the humanities scientific\u2014through the use of technical jargon, general theories about social texts, and quantitative tools to analyze word choice, sentence structure and other aspects of literature. There are even efforts to measure the imagination using functional magnetic resonance imaging.All this is fine as it pertains to political science, linguistics and neuroscience. But literature and literary criticism\u2014belles lettres\u2014ought not to be usurped in the process. Their purpose is different. Literary study ought to be concerned with the search for meaning and value in life. The humanities teach wisdom\u2014or at least exercise the faculty that leads to that elusive end. Without wisdom, so-called progress can lead to corruption and devastation.When the humanities desert their mission and seek to ally themselves with progress, they become dangerous adjuncts to ideological agendas. Students come to feel there is a definitive, \u201cvirtuous\u201d reading of an event or a text; they excoriate great authors of the past for not abiding by the standards of the present; they come to see the world as divided into victims and oppressors. They create a climate that arouses opposition from those who feel excluded or demeaned by such thinking but who lack the humanistic training to do more than lash out.The unique role of the humanities is to recognize genius, revere complexity, and be deliberative in judging character and action, in life as in art. Without training in this habit of mind, we become a polarized society with no tools to communicate across difference. Nothing happens except name-calling and retribution.The 19th-century poet       John Keats,        ended his most famous poem \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn\u201d with the lines: \u201c\u00a0\u2018Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\u2014that is all\u00a0/ Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\u2019 \u201d Are these words the smug pronouncement of a dead artifact, the oracular invocation of a higher power, the commentary of a poet interrogating the value of his work? They are all these things. We need to be skeptical of beauty and its relationship to truth, but we also need to need to see truth as beautiful, and to look with skepticism upon the products of a culture that speak to us in ugly, pseudoscientific ways.Ms. Cohen       is a dean and English professor at Drexel University.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-danger-of-progressives-inhumanity-to-the-humanities-1501270819", "keywords": ["academia,critical theory,humanities,literature,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:37:00", "news_title": "Chipotle Seeks a \u2018Kill Step\u2019", "content": "In Virginia this month, a county health director took complaints over the phone and web from customers saying they got sick at a local             Chipotle Mexican Grill.       Chipotle management swept in and temporarily closed the store for what it calls a \u201csanitizing.\u201dIs this the right approach? Maybe health inspectors need to get in there with swabs and black lights and then hold accountable the employee who brought norovirus into the store if Chipotle ever is to escape the stigma of the 2015 food-poisoning outbreaks.Some dwell on the presence of       Wall Streeter Bill Ackman,        who subsequently bought a sizable stake in the chain. Now either he\u2019s Typhoid Mary, the bringer of bad luck, or else the most important thing about this story is another Ackman investing pratfall.Smart stock pickers often say their worst miscues come from being wrong for the right reason. Mr. Ackman, in explaining his purchase to clients of his       Pershing       Square fund, clearly believed he was buying a solid company under a temporary cloud.But here\u2019s why the clean-up-and-move-on approach taken by Chipotle may be delivering a different message. It\u2019s possible that Chipotle tummy has, in fact, always been a significant risk for a Chipotle customer, as sickness is always a bit of a risk for patrons of any restaurant where fresh, unprocessed ingredients are handled by fallible human beings.The real problem is Chipotle\u2019s more-daring-than-it-seems business model of serving up fresh, raw ingredients in a fast-food chain, at fast-food prices, using a fast-food workforce. A fancy, one-off restaurant in your favorite city doesn\u2019t lend itself to a national media firestorm the way a 2,250-store chain does. The media will always pick up the scent (unpleasant metaphor) of a Chipotle incident and publicize it. And making sure an employee doesn\u2019t bring norovirus into your eatery is never going to be a 100% endeavor.All this comes as the wider food-handling community increasingly is calling for a \u201ckill step\u201d in handling raw vegetables and produce.Cooking (properly) is a kill step that works for food that is cooked. In most restaurants and grocery stores, raw greens and vegetable usually are just washed with tap water before being served to the customer. Thanks to America\u2019s interest in healthier eating, fresh produce now exceeds beef, poultry and seafood as a source of illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.After the 2015 disaster, Chipotle hired Prof.       James Marsden       of Kansas State University\u2019s renowned food safety program. By the details released so far, the company has indeed begun experimenting with kill steps. These include blanching\u2014dipping produce in boiling water\u2014or spritzing with \u201cnatural\u201d pathogen-neutralizers like lemon juice. Certain tasks have also been shifted to a central,             McDonald\u2019s                  -style kitchen and away from the local restaurant, though the company says certain steps were reversed when customers complained about the taste or appearance of their meals.Prof. Marsden, when he was hired, promised the company eventually would publish details of its innovations. Many in the food-safety camp are already keen on more-energetic kill steps, such as irradiation, chemical treatment with ozone or chlorine compounds, or the use of high-barometric-pressure systems.To be sure, it\u2019s not wrong to expect diners to accept some risk. Even the best sushi restaurant sends away a few unhappy customers. Raw meats and quite a few prepared foods from the supermarket rely on an unreliable consumer to supply a kill step. A 2007 KSU study put volunteers in a test kitchen to see if they could follow directions safely to prepare frozen, uncooked, breaded chicken products. Many couldn\u2019t. Among the findings: 100% of adolescents (the kind that work in fast-food restaurants) claimed they washed their hands when video monitoring showed they hadn\u2019t.So here\u2019s a question: How far can Chipotle go in this direction without undermining its fans\u2019 faith? Presumably the food, not the propaganda, is the main reason diners come. But the propaganda is important too. Chipotle founder       Steve Ells       wouldn\u2019t constantly harp on the horrors of \u201cartificial\u201d and \u201cprocessed\u201d ingredients if he didn\u2019t believe such talismanic claims were critical to bringing customers to his stores.The Food and Drug Administration could help: It continues to drag out an investigation and possible rule making on the use of the word \u201cnatural\u201d in food marketing. A 50-page entry in the Federal Register is surely due sometime between now and 2075 A.D., when all that\u2019s really needed is an official statement, in block letters, saying the word \u201cnatural\u201d is not a synonym for \u201csafe,\u201d \u201chealthy,\u201d \u201cnutritious\u201d or even \u201cecologically sound.\u201dIt is a junk word, all too tempting to Mr. Ells and every other marketer seeking to appeal to the reptilian brains of millennials, liberals and others for whom natural = good = me = good.At which point their consciences are liberated to enjoy a burrito with more fat, salt and calories than a Big Mac.Appeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chipotle-seeks-a-kill-step-1501270669", "keywords": ["agriculture,public health,Chipotle Mexican Grill,CMG,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility closures,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,commentaries,opinions,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,full-service restaurants,limited-service eating places,leisure,arts,hospitality"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:36:00", "news_title": "\u2018God\u2019s ACLU\u2019 Seeks Freedom for the Faithful", "content": "WashingtonClose your eyes and try to picture an activist for religious liberty. Maybe you imagine a noisily assertive Baptist, a beleaguered but intransigent Catholic nun, a militant rabbi or imam, or even a peyote-ingesting Native American. You\u2019d be unlikely, I wager, to think of an amiable 30-year-old Mexican-American woman, who sees herself as a defender of all religion, on the front lines of America\u2019s culture wars.Montse Alvarado       is the executive director of the       Becket       Fund for Religious Liberty, a Washington-based nonprofit law firm. It\u2019s named for Thomas Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury who was assassinated in 1170 for refusing to let the church in England do the bidding of       King Henry II.Advocates for religious liberty in America are part of what might be seen as the second wave of rights activism in the courts, the first being the wave that began in the 1950s and \u201960s with litigation over the rights of minorities, women and criminal suspects, among others. In the past 25 years, conservative and libertarian groups have applied lessons that the liberal vanguard learned about how to select test cases for litigation as a way to steer the law. The focus today is still on the individual, but on his right to own guns, send his children to the school of his choice, or\u2014Ms. Alvarado\u2019s field of concern\u2014worship freely and live a full religious life uncramped by the state.\u201cOur first case at Becket was in 1996,\u201d Ms. Alvarado says. \u201cA boy name       Zachary Hood       wanted to bring a \u2018Beginner\u2019s Bible\u2019 to his first-grade class on share-your-favorite-story day. His teacher said, \u2018No, you don\u2019t get to do that.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The family sued the school board but lost the case, and the Supreme Court declined to hear their appeal. But the board eventually settled in a related matter\u2014having to do with a Thanksgiving poster the 6-year-old had drawn saying he was \u201cthankful for Jesus\u201d\u2014and the federal Education Department issued official guidance shortly thereafter, affirming a student\u2019s right to express religious beliefs in all schoolwork.This past year\u2019s Supreme Court term included a landmark decision in support of religious liberty, Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer. The justices ruled that Missouri could not turn down a church\u2019s application for a public grant to resurface its playgrounds merely because of its status as a religious institution.Missouri had asserted its authority to deny the grant by citing its state constitution, which includes a \u201cBlaine amendment\u201d\u2014a provision 38 states adopted in the late 19th century to prohibit public funding of religious institutions. The Trinity Lutheran ruling \u201cis not the end of Blaine, as many people like to say,\u201d explains Ms. Alvarado. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work to be done there, but we\u2019re very positive about it.\u201dThe history of the Blaine amendments\u2014named for       James Blaine       of Maine, who introduced a similar measure in the U.S. House in 1875\u2014reveals they were intended to discriminate. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at anti-Catholic laws, based on the sentiment of the majority of the population at the time,\u201d Ms. Alvarado says. \u201cWhy we still have them today knowing their history,\u201d she says, \u201cI really don\u2019t understand.\u201dAlthough the Blaine amendment isn\u2019t yet dead, Ms. Alvarado sees the 7-2 ruling in Trinity Lutheran as \u201ca great win, a landslide win. For religious liberty, it\u2019s huge. But if you think about what it does for parental choice, and associational rights, it\u2019s also very powerful.\u201d The day after the justices decided Trinity Lutheran, they sent two other Blaine amendment cases back to state courts for reconsideration.\u201cThere were other cases in the court\u2019s last term that were a little quieter on religious liberties, but just as important,\u201d Ms. Alvarado says. She refers, somewhat improbably, to Matal v. Tam, popularly known as the \u201cSlants\u201d case, after the Asian-American musicians who asserted the right to trademark an ethnic slur as the name of their rock band. The 8-0 ruling permits citizens to register terms that are \u201cdisparaging.\u201d It regards any government attempt to prohibit such expression, however offensive it may be, as a straightforward violation of the First Amendment\u2019s free-speech protection.\u201cIt\u2019s also a religious liberties case,\u201d says Ms. Alvarado, whose organization filed a friend-of-the-court brief. I ask her to elaborate on what seems a novel analysis. \u201cOh,\u201d she exclaims, as if she\u2019s been asked to explain something much too obvious, \u201cbecause any time the government can limit speech for one side or another, you\u2019re in trouble. In \u2018Slants,\u2019 they said you can\u2019t say your name is something because it\u2019s disparaging to a specific group. Well, anything that I say as a Christian or a Jew could be disparaging to someone else. Individuals want to say things from the pulpit about any kind of cultural issue, like abortion or same-sex marriage. If they don\u2019t have the right to express themselves on moral issues, you\u2019re limiting freedom of religion to a freedom of worship alone.\u201dMs. Alvarado\u2019s point goes to the heart of the different ways in which religious liberty is perceived in America. The progressive or liberal approach is to equate free exercise of religion with the freedom to worship and to deny that it has anything to do with how a person organizes his life. The Becket Fund and others assert that most religions have complete codes governing not only worship but other aspects of conduct. This comprehensive Way of Life\u2014which leads a devoutly Christian baker to decline to decorate a cake for a same-sex wedding, for instance\u2014commands much more from believers than progressives will allow.This thrust of Matal v. Tam would seem relevant to a case on the Supreme Court\u2019s menu for the coming term, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The justices will decide whether Colorado\u2019s attempts to compel a patissier to make a cake for a same-sex wedding, in contravention of his religious beliefs, violates his free-speech or free-exercise rights under the First Amendment. Ms. Alvarado believes the state\u2019s position is logically untenable. Colorado is \u201carguing that baking a cake is not expressive,\u201d and therefore not protected speech. \u201cBut at the same time, not baking a case is obviously an expression. Is it one or the other?\u201dMs. Alvarado is optimistic about the case, in which Becket plans to file a brief. \u201cSpeech right now has been very, very protected by the court in the past four terms,\u201d she says. \u201cThey seem to have an understanding of the importance of speech for individuals, for institutions. That\u2019s an opening where you want to follow through as much as you can to expand rights.\u201dYet in Masterpiece Cakeshop the American Civil Liberties Union is doggedly on the side of the state. Why is the left hostile to religious liberty? \u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally a misunderstanding of the role of religion,\u201d Ms. Alvarado says. \u201cBesides, the only way to expand government is to edge yourself into all aspects of an individual\u2019s life, starting with how they can and cannot participate in the market.\u201d She also cites       Burwell v.       Hobby Lobby, the 2014 case in which the high court held that the craft store\u2019s owners, who object on religious grounds to certain types of contraceptives, could not be forced to provide them to employees.\u201cThe ACLU has a sadly checkered record on religious liberty,\u201d Ms. Alvarado says. \u201cIt\u2019s sometimes with us, and sometimes against, but the moment that a lot of the sexual-morality issues came into play, it seems they lost the live-and-let-live philosophy that was so fundamental to them.\u201d The ACLU, she says, supports religious liberty only for the groups it likes. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-too-common error that undermines the First Amendment standard of equal protection for all religions.\u201d This broader view is why legal scholar       Viet Dinh       has described the Becket Fund as \u201cGod\u2019s ACLU.\u201dOn the whole, Ms. Alvarado is buoyant \u201cwithout being complacent\u201d about the future of religious liberty in the U.S. The end of the Obama administration, she believes, should bring some respite to the faithful. \u201cHis administration was definitely hostile to conscience rights,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at a lot of the writings his administration put out, you\u2019ll see they were really focused on worship, the importance of being able to practice within the four walls of a church. But they were hostile to religious speech, hostile to religious exercise, anything within the workplace. They\u2019d say, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t have this job. You\u2019re a second-class citizen if you\u2019re unwilling to perform same-sex marriage services, or to accept the contraceptive mandate, or hand out these drugs. That makes you unfit for a specific position in the market.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMs. Alvarado describes this kind of hard line on religious exercise as \u201cunprecedented, unlike anything we\u2019d seen before in our country.\u201d While not all American presidents have great track records on religious liberty, the others in her lifetime do. \u201c      Bill Clinton,        obviously, was the one who signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law, so he gets a gold star,\u201d she says. (RFRA was the law under which Hobby Lobby prevailed in 2014.) \u201c      George W. Bush       gets a gold star as well. He did a lot of great work to make sure religious communities had expressive rights.\u201d The Obama administration, by contrast, authorized \u201cdirect, government-enforced action, and a wielding of the force of the state against conscience.\u201dOne of the Becket Fund\u2019s best-known victories was a case that originated under Mr. Bush\u2019s presidency and was resolved during       Mr. Obama\u2019s      . Pastor       Robert Soto,        the Native American head of the McAllen Grace Brethren Church in Texas, asserts the right to use eagle feathers in his syncretic religious services. In 2006 undercover agents attended and confiscated the feathers under the Eagle Protection Act. As Ms. Alvarado lays out the facts, she is as close to apoplectic as it\u2019s possible for a woman of her poise to be: \u201cI mean, the Wildlife       Service       going after people\u2019s eagle feathers that you can find on the ground, and you can be jailed when you want to use them to practice your religion! Isn\u2019t that a little heavy-handed?\u201d The case dragged on until June 2016, when a settlement allowed the church to keep its feathers.Does the       Trump       administration offer better prospects for religious freedom? Ms. Alvarado pauses before answering: \u201cThis administration isn\u2019t necessarily one way or another on these issues. But Trump\u2019s campaign promises were awesome.\u201d She cites an executive order President Trump issued that should protect the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Catholic nuns, from the ObamaCare contraceptive mandate. But she also says the Justice Department has yet to \u201cwork out the kinks\u201d in the matter. The Little Sisters\u2019 predicament was litigated all the way up the judicial chain, until a presumably divided Supreme Court kicked it back to the lower courts in 2016.A cursory search of the subject on the internet reveals a great deal of consternation on the political right over the lack of legal relief for the Little Sisters, largely as a result of the chronic dysfunction in the Trump Justice Department. Even so, Ms. Alvarado is hopeful about the new administration. \u201cThe way they talk about religion is as religious liberty, not as freedom of worship,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re not limiting the right. For religious freedom, you\u2019re looking at the robust version.\u201dMr. Varadarajan       is a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gods-aclu-seeks-freedom-for-the-faithful-1501270613", "keywords": ["becket fund,religious liberty,u.s. supreme court,political,general news,society,community,human rights,civil liberties,religion,commentaries,opinions,interviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:36:00", "news_title": "In Praise of the Regional Museum", "content": "San Antonio, TexasWhat type of museum might display fossilized animal feces, a state flag carried on a moon walk, a grass mat perhaps 6,000 years old, an enormous stuffed feral hog and models of circus wagons? What kind of museum would let visitors test the effects of rain on handmade topographical landscapes and then view a gown glittering with Swarovski crystals, worn in a parade by the \u201cDuchess of the Splendors of the Earth\u201d? How do we characterize a museum that seems encyclopedic, but is so eccentric? It offers the preserved body of a rare fish that lives in aquifers more than 1,300 feet below the earth. It gives visitors lessons in weaving\u2019s warp and weft. It offers weekly tours of ancient rock art paintings outside of town. And it offers a rooftop \u201cserenity space\u201d with wind chimes. (On my visit, serenity didn\u2019t stand a chance in hundred-degree heat.)Such is the Witte Museum, which has just completed a $100 million renovation and expansion that began in 2012. It is now a prime example of a type of museum too often ignored: the regional museum. The regional museum takes the word \u201cprovincial\u201d as praise, even though, in our era, the word \u201cnational\u201d is more often coveted. A national museum seems to promise objectivity, immensity and authority. The regional museum may have similar ambitions but a different function, illuminating a region\u2019s distinctive experience and perspective. The American founders created a bicameral legislature for a reason; we also need a bicameral view of museums.In this case, the region is South Texas. And in keeping with that culture\u2019s expansive vistas, renovations have more than doubled the Witte\u2019s size, giving it 174,000 square feet of exhibitions on a 10-acre campus on the banks of the San Antonio river. While a national museum might claim a more systematic cast, a regional museum is usually closer to the passions of the collector and the curiosity cabinets of old. That spirit remains here. Everything we see is from this region and, in that, becomes more compelling.Thus, in the newly created entrance space (Lake | Flato, architects) we seem to be entering a world of great spectacle. An animated vision of a soaring Quetzalcoatlus is projected on the entryway\u2019s ceiling; at the far end of a towering atrium, a locally found skeleton of this pterosaur\u2014the largest animal to have ever flown\u2014is suspended. We see, too, replicas of the enormous footprints of a giant Acrocanthosaurus embedded deep in rock, a trace left as the creature sauntered some two miles an hour along an ancient shoreline that is now in San Antonio\u2019s Government Canyon State Natural Area. All of the museum\u2019s dinosaur displays, it might be said, are locally sourced.In fact, the museum grew out of such sources. In the Northeast, regional museums have tended to evolve out of European-style \u201chistorical societies\u201d founded by gentlemen with natural-history collections or libraries. Here, strata are more intricate (Texas history unfolded under six national flags: Spain, France, Mexico, the Texas Republic, the Confederacy and the U.S.). The Witte was begun in 1923 in a San Antonio high-school classroom as a teacher, Ellen Schultz, raised funds to purchase a local natural-history collection. A $65,000 bequest by a businessman,       Alfred W. Witte       (pronounced \u201cwitty\u201d), allowed the museum to begin its institutional life in 1926; it grew, adding collections of local paintings and historical artifacts.Exhibit designs by Gallagher & Associates leave the founding classroom far behind, though each of the new galleries also includes a \u201cLab\u201d with activities aimed at educating young visitors in the practice of paleontology, say, or basket weaving. One gallery is devoted to the ecological habitats of contemporary Texas, most notably with curved and elevated \u201cislands\u201d dividing the space into regional dioramas which can seem uncanny because of the lack of intervening glass. Scenes are vividly enacted in tall grass or brush; an ocelot, a pronghorn, an armadillo, an alligator\u2014everywhere we look are such creatures, accompanied by other denizens of the river valley, desert or prairie of Texas landscapes.On a second floor is an exploration of the Pecos cultures who dwelled here thousands of years before American Indian tribal identifications, leaving behind elaborate cave paintings. An interactive screen helps us begin to understand their techniques and symbols. And in displays beside human-scale dioramas are artifacts\u2014baskets, sandals\u2014preserved for millennia in the arid air. For a variety of reasons, Native American displays have become the most sentimental exhibits in museums, but not here, perhaps because this world is definitively prior to contemporary identity narratives.An adjoining building focuses on the last two centuries of South Texas history, telling the complicated story with too much haste and compression. I was least enamored of a major interactive exhibit about the human body and health, which was overladen with homilies about nutrition and exercise. But several galleries also sample the museum\u2019s 300,000 artifacts, including an imposing Texas-oriented art collection. Overall, the result is extraordinary, and much of this has come into being since 2012 under the watch of the Witte\u2019s president and CEO,       Marise McDermott.       The annual attendance of 350,000 is expected to grow. And Ms. McDermott plans to raise another $200 million before the centenary, creating yet another pavilion along with an endowment. Over all, the approach is so true to its origins that in the midst of South Texas ambition, the model of a regional museum still stakes its enduring claim.\u2014Mr. Rothstein is the Journal\u2019s Critic at Large.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-praise-of-the-regional-museum-1501270596", "keywords": ["arts in review,regional museum, witte museum,political,general news,arts,entertainment,theaters,entertainment venues,museums,historical sites,gardens,leisure,hospitality"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:34:00", "news_title": "Uber Approaches GE CEO Jeff Immelt About Top Role ", "content": "Uber Technologies Inc. is considering General Electric Co. Chief Executive       Jeff Immelt       among a handful of candidates for its top position, according people familiar with the matter.The ride-hailing company\u2019s five-member search committee has had active discussions with Mr. Immelt, who has expressed interest in the job, these people said. Mr. Immelt is relinquishing his role as GE\u2019s leader at the end of the month and will remain chairman through year-end.Mr. Immelt is among the most-seasoned executives that Uber has approached in the past five weeks since investors orchestrated a dramatic revolt to\u00a0push out co-founder       Travis Kalanick       following a series of scandals at the eight-year-old company. Mr. Kalanick remains on the board and is a member of the search committee.The hurried search process, which Uber hopes to wrap up by Labor Day, has whittled the candidates down to just a few names, people familiar with the matter said, including       Meg Whitman,        the chief executive and chairman of             Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.On Thursday night, Ms. Whitman took her name out of the running, writing on her Twitter account that she won\u2019t be the next chief executive at Uber. \u201cNormally I do not comment on rumors, but the speculation about my future and Uber has become a distraction,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo let me make this as clear as I can. I am fully committed to HPE and plan to remain the company\u2019s CEO\u2026Uber\u2019s CEO will not be Meg Whitman.\u201dThe Uber chief executive role would be a change for the veteran executive who runs a business that dwarfs Uber by revenue. It is possible Mr. Immelt or the other candidates could withdraw their names from consideration, these people said. Bloomberg News earlier reported the executive names as candidates.Uber\u2019s chief executive spot is potentially tantalizing for executives seeking a role in remaking a global powerhouse and a once-in-a-lifetime payout if Uber were to seek an IPO. But the company is grappling with the fallout from a former software engineer\u2019s allegations it tolerated sexism and sexual harassment, and it is still seeking a new independent board chairman, as well as chiefs of operations, finance and marketing, among other top positions.During his 16-year tenure at GE, Mr. Immelt significantly reshaped the industrial giant. He sold off many divisions\u2014including plastics, financial services and virtually all of its consumer-facing products\u2014steering it toward its industrial operations of power turbines, jet engines and medical equipment.Mr. Immelt\u2019s tenure was marred by GE\u2019s stock underperforming both peers and the broader market. So far this year, the stock is down nearly 20%.But, at 61 years old, the globe-trotting salesman isn\u2019t expected to sit still in retirement. He spent his entire career with GE, but some observers expect him to remain active in the business and possibly political world.Uber\u2019s search committee consists of five board members, including Mr. Kalanick;             Nestl\u00e9 SA       executive       Wan Ling Martello      ; venture capitalist       Matt Cohler      ; media magnate       Arianna Huffington       and private-equity partner       David Trujillo.San Francisco-based Uber was valued at nearly $70 billion following a fundraising round about a year ago, making it the most world\u2019s most valuable private company, and has raised about $15 billion in venture and debt financing.\u2014Thomas Gryta contributed to this article.Write to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Uber Weighs Immelt At GE as Next Chief.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-considering-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-for-top-role-1501204518", "keywords": ["ge,general electric,jeff immelt,jeffrey immelt,uber,venture capital people,Uber Technologies,Jeff Immelt,David Trujillo,Meg Whitman,Wan Ling Martello,Matt Cohler,Arianna Huffington,political,general news,living,lifestyle,retail,wholesale,etailing,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,e-commerce,online service providers,technology,sharing economy services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:34:00", "news_title": "For Alabama\u2019s Junior Senator, What a Long Strange Trip It\u2019s Been", "content": "In late June, a seemingly blockbuster article appeared in the Alabama Political Reporter. It accused       Luther       Strange\u2014now the Yellowhammer State\u2019s junior U.S. senator\u2014of being present when a coal company attempted to bribe a state legislator. The transaction, which supposedly occurred in 2014 when Mr. Strange was Alabama\u2019s attorney general, sounded implausible. The next day, the alleged bribe recipient, Democratic Rep.       John Rogers,        said Mr. Strange \u201cwas not there and there was no bribe.\u201dThat normally would have ended this tale of political corruption, but the accusation came in the midst of a nasty GOP primary for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Attorney General       Jeff Sessions.       Not only did the Alabama Political Reporter refuse to retract the story; two rival candidates began using it against Mr. Strange.Before he was appointed by then-Gov.       Robert Bentley       to the Senate in February, 6-foot-9 \u201cBig Luther\u201d was a popular, crusading attorney general. He set up Alabama\u2019s Public Corruption and White Collar Crime Division. His crack team of investigators prosecuted more than 20 officials statewide, including Gov. Bentley, who was forced to resign under a cloud in April. Mr. Strange didn\u2019t exempt members of his own party from scrutiny, but his success created enemies.Mr. Strange recused himself from the prosecution of       Mike Hubbard,        the Republican House speaker convicted on felony ethics charges in June 2016. That didn\u2019t spare him the wrath of an entire wing of the Republican party that includes former Gov.       Bob Riley       and timber tycoon       Jimmy Rane,        considered Alabama\u2019s richest citizen. Mr. Hubbard\u2019s supporters wanted state Senate President Pro Tempore Del Marsh to challenge Mr. Strange in the special election, but he declined. Without a candidate, the anti-Strange faction is still pursuing its real priority: stopping Mr. Strange.The primary takes place Aug. 15, and if no one gets 50% a runoff of the top two vote-getters is set for Sept. 26. The general election, in which Republicans are expected to prevail, comes Dec. 12. The winner will serve until the regularly scheduled Senate election in 2020.\u201cIt\u2019s possible to get to 50 percent,\u201d Mr. Strange told me last week. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult with 10 people in the race.\u201d Two of them, U.S. Rep.       Mo Brooks       and suspended Alabama Supreme Court justice       Roy Moore,        have a shot at making the runoff, as does Mr. Strange.Mr. Strange likely would be in better shape were it not for his association with Mr. Bentley, who initially called for a 2018 special election to replace Mr. Sessions. \u201cI knew I\u2019d be criticized one way or the other,\u201d the senator acknowledged. Still, Mr. Strange followed Mr. Sessions\u2019s advice and said yes when the governor offered him the job.Criticism erupted instantly. Yet with the election 19 months away, Mr. Strange thought he would have time to overcome the Bentley connection and build a record as a capable, reliable and popular senator. But the scandal-scarred governor resigned three weeks later, and his replacement,       Kay Ivey,        was eager to distinguish herself from her predecessor. She moved up the dates of the primary and runoff to this year, leaving the new senator less time to build an independent reputation.Worse, Mr. Strange\u2019s opponents have insinuated he negotiated a quid pro quo deal with the departing governor. Never mind that this made no sense because there was no quo. Mr. Strange became a senator because he was the obvious choice\u2014the person with the most impressive background. The governor got nothing in return: He resigned and pleaded guilty to two campaign violations.There\u2019s no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Strange, but the link to Mr. Bentley has proved damaging to his primary campaign. Had Mr. Strange turned down the appointment, \u201che\u2019d be running in 2018 as a white knight from the outside against somebody with the stench of a Bentley association,\u201d according to       Quin Hillyer,        a prominent Alabama writer and columnist.Mr. Strange has plenty to talk about today. He was the lead attorney general in the case against BP after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. He fired the private lawyers the previous attorney general had hired, saving Alabama $180 million in legal fees. The state was awarded $2.3 billion in damages. He also joined other Republican attorneys general in challenging Obama administration policies from energy regulation to health care.Mr. Strange is being treated in Washington like any Republican incumbent. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the National Republican Senate Committee, the political arm of GOP senators, support him. He\u2019s backed by his Alabama colleague, Republican Sen.       Richard Shelby.       A poll, conducted for eight businesses and business group earlier this month, put Mr. Strange in the lead with 33%. Mr. Moore had 26% and Mr. Brooks 16%. The question is whether anyone can get past 50% in August.Mr. Barnes,        executive editor of the Weekly Standard, is a Fox News commentator.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-alabamas-junior-senator-what-a-long-strange-trip-its-been-1501270469", "keywords": ["political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:33:00", "news_title": "Metals: Gold Climbs to Six-Week High", "content": "Gold prices gained for the third consecutive week on Friday, boosted by slower-than-expected U.S. economic growth and increased worries over political risks.Futures for December delivery settled up 0.7% at $1,275.50 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, trading at the highest level since June 14.U.S gross domestic product rose 2.6% in the period from April to June, the Commerce Department said Friday, coming in just shy of economist expectations for 2.7%.

Dangerfield\u2019s brilliantly written book charts the escalating level of violence, disconcerting and dynamic, in the richest country in the world from 1910 to 1914. The chaos came from both left and the right. The Liberal Party had inaugurated a comparatively modest welfare system and then increased taxes on the well-off to help pay for it. The House of Lords vociferously objected and then capitulated, which only led to more confrontational action. Society was further challenged by the remarkable violence related to the women\u2019s suffrage movement, which included demonstrations, arrests, hunger strikes and forced feedings. A huge increase in labor unrest and strikes contributed to the chaos. There was agitation, on the right, against Home Rule in Ireland, with the Tories pledging to support armed resistance by Ulster Protestants, who were militantly opposed to a semi-independent Ireland. There was a growing danger of a civil war between Protestants and Catholics. It was only the greater violence of World War I that prevented it.By       William Morris       (1890)2. William Morris\u2014poet, designer, businessman, socialist, novelist, printer\u2014was an extraordinary Victorian. In his visionary book \u201cNews From Nowhere,\u201d he imagined a post-revolutionary British utopia, an ideal world achieved after a violent mid-20th-century civil war between the forces of capitalism and labor. In this Britain there is no longer any need for law courts, prisons or a central government: There are self-governing communes based on participatory direct democracy. Work hours are minimal, and leisure and communal activities are paramount. Here the alienation from society caused by capitalism no longer exists. The world is very much as if Morris & Co. had designed everything; its inhabitants have learned that pleasure in work results in the creation of beautiful objects. It is a bucolic society, a British dream come true. The book\u2019s last line is: \u201cIf others can see it as I have seen it, then it may be called a vision rather than a dream.\u201dBy       Paul Fussell       (1975)3. With penetrating insight, Paul Fussell examines not only how World War I transformed British writers\u2019 views of the world but also how that transformation affected the work of many of America\u2019s outstanding writers a generation later. He describes, eloquently, how the attitudes of the British writers changed as the war proceeded. At first poets,       Rupert Brooke       among them, had found it possible to romanticize the struggle. Then came the carnage\u2014the British experience on the Western Front in France. With that came a profoundly different rendering of war\u2019s terrors. In Fussell\u2019s telling, the works of writers like       Siegfried Sassoon,       Robert Graves,       Wilfred Owen      \u2014the war poets\u2014had a liberating influence on the great American novelists of World War II. The novels of Norman Mailer,       James Jones,       Joseph Heller       and       Thomas Pynchon       portray war\u2019s realities as brutal, absurd, outrageous: a view that the poets of the earlier war had come to know well.By Edward Upward (1938)4. Edward Upward, the novelist and short-story writer, was a crucial figure in left-wing literary circles in the 1930s. His vivid first novel depicts a day in the life of an unnamed young man as he entertains thoughts on how he might make a violent break from the course of his life. He imagines running off to the Empire, eloping to Iceland, etc. In proper 1930s style, he sees beauty in a steam roller: \u201cIt was simple and bold and powerful . . . thumping with its pistons like a thumping heart.\u201d He ultimately resolves matters by committing himself to helping the workers create a better world. \u201cYour life would not have been altogether wasted and worthless, as it would have been if you made no effort at all to help.\u201d Written at a time when Britain faced a desperate economic plight, the novel combines a fantasy world that Upward and       Christopher Isherwood       created when they were Cambridge undergraduates with a call for action.By       George Orwell       (1938)5. The promise of revolution and how easily it is betrayed are vividly evoked in George Orwell\u2019s tale of his experience of the Spanish Civil War. He had gone to Spain in 1936 intending to report on the war but once there found what seemed to him to be a new egalitarian society achieved through violent action. This was a world, in short, that he felt he must fight for, and so he joined the anti-Stalinist POUM militia. He would then soon see how internecine warfare, driven by Soviet policy, destroyed the revolutionary new society. It is Orwell\u2019s view, in this work, that societies should be made socialist, by violence if necessary. He is no less clear about his understanding of the ease with which such societies can be destroyed by their power-hungry leaders. His \u201cHomage to Catalonia\u201d ends with his return to his beloved homeland, to \u201csleeping the deep, deep sleep of England, from which I sometimes fear that we shall never wake till we are jerked out of it by the roar of bombs.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-stansky-1501270167", "keywords": ["bookcar0729,book review,books,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:27:00", "news_title": "The Best New Children\u2019s Books", "content": "To create his frightful, dread-soaked short stories and poems, Edgar Allan Poe combined and recombined certain literary elements, much as a poisoner might use toxins from different vials to achieve his own murderous effect. For Poe (1809-49), these ingredients included fire, insanity, confinement and death. Each grim motif gets its own symbol in \u201cPoe: Stories and Poems\u201d (Candlewick, 120 pages, $14), a graphic-novel translation of seven of Poe\u2019s best-known works, and artist       Gareth Hinds       includes the relevant symbols at the start of each story or poem to hint at the horrors to come.For the grisly 1842 tale \u201cThe Masque of the Red Death,\u201d for example, Mr. Hinds warns that we will encounter death, disease and scary sounds. These portents have the twin effects of engaging both our critical and our imaginative faculties so that we are aware of what Poe is doing even as he is doing it to us, just as the poor bound victim in \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum,\u201d also from 1842, watches as the \u201ccrescent of glittering steel, its bottom edge evidently as sharp as a razor,\u201d descends toward him in inexorable sweeps. Brilliant and terrifying, this collection shows in pictures much of what Poe revealed only through words. Still, Mr. Hinds has retained sufficient ambiguity to leave brave young readers with many of their own dark imaginings.Just as a graphic-novel presentation may ease a young reader\u2019s access to the eldritch world of Poe, so art books for children use informality to make fine art accessible to the potential young connoisseur. Pictures are made to seem friendly and undemanding. In the picture book \u201cMasterpiece Mix\u201d (Holiday House, 32 pages, $16.95),       Roxie Munro       achieves this effect by setting great paintings amid her own cartoon-style drawing.\u201cToday I will make a new painting,\u201d the unnamed adult narrator announces, showing 4- to 7-year-olds how she prepares a large canvas and assembles her tools. But what to paint? This question produces a series of possible answers in the form of pictures borrowed from the National Gallery of Art, sorted into categories such as landscapes, portraits, still lifes and figure studies. A final two-page spread shows the results of the artist\u2019s labors: a witty seek-and-find city scene that incorporates all the pictures. The flag outside Al\u2019s Gym shows the boxers from Bellows\u2019s \u201cBoth Members of This Club,\u201d for instance, and a bridal salon advertises its wares with Whistler\u2019s \u201cThe White Girl.\u201dA larger and more detailed collection of artwork designed to awaken aesthetic interest fills the pages of \u201cOld Masters Rock\u201d (Pimpernel, 109 pages, $22.95), a chatty guide to looking at pictures for children and parents by art dealer Maria-Christina Sayn-Wittgenstein Nottebohm. The author, who goes by the nickname Puppa, has assembled a distinctive collection of 50 paintings, some of which, like an otherworldly Arcimboldo head made of animals and an Ingres portrait, are drawn from private collections. Each picture\u2014including a 16th-century watercolor by       Hans Hoffmann       showing a furry boar piglet (above)\u2014comes with a page of text that include questions to consider, details about the artist and invitations to notice telling details. Of a       Frans Hals       picture of a laughing fisher boy, for instance, the author asks: \u201cIs he hardworking or lazy?\u201d A moment later she reveals that, according to the syntax of 17th-century Dutch painting, the boy\u2019s pose and sidelong look convey that he is \u201ca lazybones.\u201dMaking fine art available to children is a noble cause, and I\u2019m all for it, though here and there (including the title) \u201cOld Masters Rock\u201d feels a bit too breezy.

The rest of us more cautious types watch from afar and marvel uncomprehendingly. Among the vast literature of aquatic endurance\u2014stories of sailing in search of treasure or an unknown island or a rumored passage, or just from one side of an inhospitable sea to the other\u2014a small but strong strand is the quest to catch the monster. Melville\u2019s Ahab and Hemingway\u2019s Old Man spring to mind.       Morten Str\u00f8ksnes\u2019s       account of how he and a friend set about trying to haul in one of the world\u2019s most outlandish giant predators from the inky depths of the Norwegian sea is a worthy addition to the subgenre.The author, an Oslo-based literary journalist, casts \u201cShark Drunk\u201d as a quest, arbitrary in direction by definition and, in practical terms, completely pointless. The Greenland shark is huge\u2014bigger than a Great White\u2014and hideous. It can live up to 500 years and does not have sex until into its second century. Parasites eat its eyes, blinding it. The shark flesh smells of urine and is imbued with a toxin that induces a state akin to extreme intoxication in anyone dumb enough to eat it\u2014hence the title of the book.A Greenland shark swims very slowly through the depths, feeding off sleeping seals and the blubber of dead whales. To say that it has limited sporting appeal would be overstating the case. For bait, Mr. Str\u00f8ksnes and his friend use a chunk of whale meat or a thighbone covered in rotting meat from a Highland bull carcass, having previously dumped to the bottom of the sea sacks of stinking bull guts or the waste from cod livers.By Morten Str\u00f8ksnesKnopf, 307 pages, $26.95Obviously no one in their right mind would go after this creature for the fun of the fishing. The pursuit of the Greenland shark becomes a kind of literary curtain-rail upon which Mr. Str\u00f8ksnes suspends his collection of musings and diversions. \u201cOur thoughts have slipped their moorings and are drifting with the current,\u201d he writes as the two adventurers sit patiently in their inflatable, waiting day after day for a shark to bite. And drift they do, far but rarely too far, from the matter at hand. The sea and its infinite wonders remain the main focus. Mr. Str\u00f8ksnes makes a telling point\u2014one that had not occurred to me before\u2014about the vertical dimension, with life from top to bottom. \u201cThe vast majority of living space on earth, so to speak, can be found in the sea.\u201dDuring one of several periods of non-fishing enforced either by the weather or the malfunction of the outboard engine essential to shark fishing, Mr. Str\u00f8ksnes delves deep into works of the 16th-century Swedish bishop       Olaus Magnus,        and in particular his epic ocean map, Carta marina, with its depictions of red-eyed, fanged sea monsters. The sea swine, for instance, had four dragon\u2019s feet and an eye in its navel. The ziphius had an owl\u2019s face and a dorsal fin it used to cut into ships to eat their crews.When the age of science dawned, men of reason tended to mock the ancients for their childish credulity. But, as Mr. Str\u00f8ksnes vividly shows, nothing Olaus Magnus and the others ever dreamt up exceeded the strangeness of the creatures of the deep marine biologists found when they finally caught up with them. Consider the vampire squid, which bites off one of its own arms when under attack, leaving the limb to drift off with its minute blue lights blinking as a diversion.Mr. Str\u00f8ksnes and his partner encounter their own wonders as they hunt their shark. A sperm whale\u2014the first his friend has seen in 50 years of living by the sea\u2014spouts, dives and resurfaces. \u201cA thunderous sound rumbles across the surface of the water,\u201d Mr. Str\u00f8ksnes writes. \u201cIt reminds me of the deepest tones of a church organ, but wetter and with a trace of heavy gurgling.\u201d On their last trip out, the two run into a group of orcas, racing and diving \u201cas if they have an appointment to keep and yet have enough time to play a little along the way.\u201dIn between all this, there is a challenging expedition to catch spawning cod\u2014successful, in that they weigh down the boat with fish, but highly perilous after they get lost in a snowstorm on the way home. \u201cThe deep, salty black sea rolls towards us, cold and indifferent, lacking all empathy,\u201d Mr. Str\u00f8ksnes records. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t care about our hopes and fears\u2014nor does it give a damn about our descriptions.\u201d The men make it back to safety, just, and then spend days preparing the fish for drying, detaching the livers for oil and making use of every part of the cod (just as his companion\u2019s fishing forebears once did)\u2014out of respect for a resource too precious to waste.That respect for the past\u2014for the isolated fishing villages of northern Norway and for the hard lives of their people\u2014runs like a powerful current through the book. In general the tone is cheerful, almost chatty, which makes the story all the more unsettling when the friends come close to falling out, the tensions between them heightened while stuck on shore waiting for the ever-unreliable outboard engine to be repaired. It roars back just in time, and they sally forth once more to find the shark.This rich and fascinating book, translated from the Norwegian by Tiina Nunnally, reaches its climax abruptly and surprisingly, and takes its leave rapidly. Morten Str\u00f8ksnes\u2019s clever trick is to remind us for one last time that the catching of the big fish is the least important part of the story.\u2014Mr. Fort\u2019s books include \u201cThe Book of Eels\u201d and \u201cThe Far From Compleat Angler.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hunting-a-500-year-old-shark-1501269989", "keywords": ["bookcar0729,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:25:00", "news_title": "Maybe Cities Were a Bad Idea", "content": "\u2018My name is Ollie,\u2019 said the waitress, before boring me with her life story. The effect on my digestion was similar to that of       Brenna Hassett\u2019s       intrusiveness on her book: The author affects intimacy as tiresomely as the most egocentric table-server, and it is hard, amid all the chatty distractions, to admire her history of the effects of sedentarism on the bodily well-being of farmers and city-dwellers. If you want to know why she likes tents, or how she used an egg carton to make 18th-century fancy dress, or how she got in line behind       Pamela Anderson       at a Starbucks in Malibu, or how she \u201cended up locked in a . . . box full of things that go beep,\u201d pick up this book. Her cultural allusions include       Eddie Izzard,        Hannibal Lecter and \u201cRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves,\u201d but she does not expect readers to know that \u201ca man called       Edward Jenner      \u201d pioneered inoculation. Her humor is flippant or facetious, as when she calls the sacrifice of Isaac \u201ca miraculous kid-ram switcheroo.\u201d Footnotes reference Chunky Monkey ice cream and the Daily Mail. Some authors think that no book can succeed unless demotic and dumb. It is a shame to find Ms. Hassett among them, because she has gifts of scholarship and wordsmithery that could, with more discipline and respect for her readers, contribute mightily toward knowledge and debate.The problem this archaeologist author addresses is one of the most absorbing in the history of the last 14,000 years or so: why, when sedentary ways are obviously destructive of health, have so many people abandoned foraging for farming and rural for urban life\u2014or, as she says, why have we \u201cmoved to no longer moving?\u201d She focuses on the evidence of bones, and so psychological sickness and social malaise are under-represented in her tally. But, on most calculations, there is no doubt that farming is bad for you. Populations that adopt it die earlier than hunter-gatherers, exhibiting more stunted and distorted bones, more tooth decay, more exposure to viruses and more evidence of malnutrition than their foraging predecessors. Concentrated populations are accident-prone niches for epidemics, where filth and pollution accumulate, while deprivation ensues from widening inequalities.Yet farming and urbanization conquered most of the world, with rapidity that, as Ms. Hassett points out, seems astonishing by comparison with the rate of transmission of earlier technological innovations. A way of life that brought \u201cdebilitating, spine-crunching diseases\u201d zoomed across the globe during the Neolithic revolution, whereas two-edged flints took perhaps half a millennium to reach Europe from Africa. Populations grow at the expense of individual health and happiness; resources increase, but so do risks of wipe-out.By Brenna HassettBloomsbury Sigma, 320 pages, $27\u200bThe paradox is important, because it helps to show how cultural adaptations can defy evolution: instead of promoting the survival of organisms and populations that transmit them, cultural change often kills them off. That is why most farming and urban peoples are one with Nineveh and Tyre, and history is a path picked amid their ruins. To avoid future annihilation, we need to understand past errors.At times, Ms. Hassett gets close to doing so. She distrusts a \u201cprogressive narrative of increasing \u2018complexity\u2019 reaching an apex in agrarian states.\u201d She is good at undermining collective complacency. \u201cUniversalising philosophers who can\u2019t quite picture themselves anywhere else but the pinnacle of human achievement\u201d dismay her. She misses, however, the most promising ways of resolving the contradictions she exposes. She is strangely indifferent to the effects of ancient climate change, which, at the inception of agriculture, forced people either to domesticate and cultivate the threatened species on which they depended, or to follow the retreating ice-edge. Nor does she notice the convergence of the late medieval and early modern \u201cage of plague\u201d with the low temperatures that help to explain the microbial mutations of the time.She dismisses, moreover, the importance of key decision-makers: elites who benefited from tillage and herding at the expense of peasants and workers. She seems reluctant to admit that ancient rulers imposed \u201can institutionalised programme of forced labour,\u201d but that is more or less what happened in highly regulated \u201chydraulic civilisations\u201d that organized subject-peoples for irrigation, tillage, monumental building and war. Ms. Hassett notices what she calls a Neolithic \u201c \u2018spike\u2019 in violence\u201d but overlooks the political changes that enhanced rulers\u2019 power: the accumulation of surpluses that allowed them to augment followings and cement loyalties; the opportunity to warehouse harvests and therefore to mobilize police; and the need to defend fields and therefore to raise armies.Ms. Hassett gropes for, but does not grasp, a useful analogy. Industrialization was, like agriculture, an innovation favorable to the elite but immiserating for early workforces. The boss class victimized them as surely as the pharaohs exploited peasants and slaves. Ms. Hassett has a laudable dislike of inequality but errs, I think, in seeing its excesses as the results of farming and city-building, rather than as part of their cause. Claiming that there were \u201cno young tortoise princesses\u201d\u2014that is, no youngsters buried with signs of heritable status\u2014before the Neolithic period, she misdates the earliest evidence of hereditarily transmitted power by at least 10,000 years. In as much as human agency\u2014rather than environmental constraints or the co-evolution of humans and the domesticated species we depend on\u2014was responsible for propelling our species into farms and cities, the effort was accomplished by a power caste, making decisions for its own benefit.\u200bAfter Ms. Hassett\u2019s imprecations against cities, her final optimism seems misplaced. \u201cThe secret of the modern city\u2019s success,\u201d she thinks, is its capacity for democratic self-rectifications. \u201cSo many eyes on so many problems will, however grindingly slowly, force action.\u201d But I know of only three influences that have ever checked the egotism of elites: the constraints of war (which does more harm than good), the threat of revolution (which is underrated in our current world) and the beneficence of religion (which, in the face of fanaticism and secularism, now seems hopelessly feeble and fading).\u2014Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto is a professor at Notre Dame and the author, most recently, of \u201cA Foot in the River: Why Our Lives Change\u2014and the Limits of Evolution.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/maybe-cities-were-a-bad-idea-1501269935", "keywords": ["bookcar0729,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:23:00", "news_title": "Lizzie Borden Revisited", "content": "Raymond Chandler once said of the       Lizzie Borden       case that \u201cits fascination is its extreme gruesomeness against a background of extreme respectability.\u201d Anyone who knows the old rhyme\u2014\u201cLizzie Borden took an ax . . . \u201d\u2014might well assume that she had been found guilty of hacking her father and stepmother to death. In fact, after a trial in June 1893, she was acquitted, though the evidence, admittedly circumstantial, pointed to her guilt. It\u2019s not hard to understand why the Fall River, Mass., jury could not quite believe a 32-year-old spinster and Sunday-school teacher capable of so hideous a crime.With \u201cSee What I Have Done,\u201d       Sarah Schmidt       has made a novel of the case, basing her narrative on what facts we know but adding in details of her own. She undoubtedly faced two distinct challenges: first, creating an atmosphere in which, granting the family\u2019s gentility, the crimes become believable; and second, leaving the question of \u201cwhodunit\u201d teasingly open as long as possible. She has met both challenges splendidly.Ms. Schmidt tells the story through different voices: those of Lizzie herself; her elder sister, Emma (who was staying with friends at the time of the murders); a maid, Bridget; and a violent hobo, Benjamin, recruited by the young women\u2019s uncle to confront, beat up and\u2014perhaps\u2014kill       Andrew Borden,        their father, because he has been treating his daughters harshly.By Sarah SchmidtAtlantic Monthly Press, 328 pages, $26The novel begins with Lizzie telling Bridget of her \u201cdiscovery\u201d of her father\u2019s body, moves back to the day before, then forward again, then back into the two sisters\u2019 childhood and adolescence. The novel\u2019s denouement is in Benjamin\u2019s voice, the reliability of which may be questionable. The shifting time scale works well: It\u2019s a neatly patterned novel, deftly done.Chandler may have been right in speaking of the \u201cbackground of extreme respectability\u201d; that was certainly the appearance presented to the world. But in the novel it is a home in which ill feelings fester. Both daughters have come to resent their stepmother, whom they address as \u201cMrs. Borden.\u201d As for their well-to-do father, he is, despite moments of generosity, a domestic tyrant. His relationship with Lizzie seems now disturbingly close, now brutal. On the day before the murders he decides to get rid of Lizzie\u2019s pigeons, on the grounds that they bring disease into the house. So he chops off their heads with a hatchet, leaving Lizzie to find the bodies. Extreme respectability hides horrors behind locked doors.Ms. Schmidt nicely handles the somewhat bumbling police investigation. Their initial reluctance to regard Lizzie as the most likely suspect is made understandable: Such a well-brought-up young woman, they thought, could not commit such a deed unless she were insane, and Lizzie, though high-strung, shows signs of shock, not madness. Yet there seems to be no one else who could have hacked Mrs. Borden and Andrew to death. So Lizzie is arrested and brought to trial.It\u2019s a gripping and still puzzling story, and Ms. Schmidt contrives to make her version persuasive. In some respects the novel is over-written. Blood jumps. Words are snarled or spat out. When Lizzie eats cake, she says that she lets \u201cthe deliciousness form soft pyramids in my cheeks.\u201d Ms. Schmidt\u2019s intelligent treatment of the story makes such strained writing feel irritatingly superfluous.That said, \u201cSee What I Have Done\u201d is a credible imagining of a bizarre episode. It also offers a convincing explanation of why, a dozen years after the murders, Emma suddenly left the house that she and Lizzie had bought and lived in together since the trial and never spoke to her again.\u2014Mr. Massie is the author of many novels, most recently, \u201cEnd Games in Bordeaux.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lizzie-borden-revisited-1501269813", "keywords": ["bookcar0729,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:22:00", "news_title": "Uber\u2019s CEO Search Reaches New Degree of Difficulty", "content": "Five weeks after       Travis Kalanick\u2019s       surprise resignation as chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc., the board of the now-leaderless company is wrestling with a thorny question.Should it negotiate with             SoftBank Group Corp.      , which has in recent weeks approached Uber with a multibillion-dollar investment offer that could alter the course of the ride-sharing powerhouse? Or should it wait until after it hires a new chief executive to consider the offer?The puzzle points up the delicate situation Uber\u2019s eight-member board is in as it rushes to find a chief executive to head a depleted executive suite and help navigate a litany of legal challenges, fierce competition and a contentious investor base angling to preserve the company\u2019s nearly $70 billion valuation.On Thursday, Uber\u2019s board met to discuss chief executive candidates and the offer from the Japanese tech giant, a potential deal that ultimately could affect the recruiting. Uber has set a Labor Day deadline to name a new chief executive, but the board faces an unprecedented array of obstacles, uninvolved recruiters say.The board is also trying to find an independent chairman to replace the incumbent, Garrett Camp, an Uber co-founder who is expected to remain a director. At the same time, the board is integrating three new directors, all of whom serve on its five-member chief executive search committee.And Mr. Kalanick, known for his tight grip on the company that he co-founded, sits on the board\u2019s search committee, something of a rarity. It is unusual for an ousted chief executive to serve on the board committee seeking a replacement, according to       Margot McShane,        a managing director in the San Francisco office of executive-search firm Russell Reynolds Associates Inc.Meanwhile, Uber\u2019s board is still contending with the fallout of an internal investigation into allegations of sexism and sexual harassment and a list of 47 proposed reforms from former U.S. Attorney General       Eric Holder,        whose law firm oversaw the monthslong probe.Some people who have been approached about the chief executive job and some investors said the search process seemed haphazard, particularly in the early stages when Uber hadn\u2019t taken certain steps. For example, it was slow to create a detailed multipage job description, known as a \u201cspec.\u201d Board members and investors also sought out candidates on their own, leading to an occasionally scattershot approach.An Uber spokesman declined to comment.Uber lost one big-name prospect Thursday when             Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.       Chief Executive       Meg Whitman       said on her Twitter account she wouldn\u2019t be leaving to take the job. General Electric Co. Chief Executive       Jeff Immelt      has met with Uber and expressed interest in the job, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr. Immelt\u2019s fellow directors may raise questions about his Uber flirtation during a GE board meeting Friday. He relinquishes his chief executive role at the end of the month but remains chairman through year-end.Others who had been approached for the job early on include       John Donahoe,        the former head of             eBay Inc.,       and       Thomas Staggs,        the former Walt Disney Co. chief operating officer, according to people familiar with the matter.Some investors privately said they were disappointed Ms. Whitman ruled herself out, viewing her as the most qualified of the candidates on Uber\u2019s short list. Several investors said they believe it was the result of a divide developing on the board, with some directors, including media magnate       Arianna Huffington,        seeking a leader in the mold of Mr. Kalanick, while the newer board members angle for a chief executive who will set a different course.In the weeks before he was pushed out, Mr. Kalanick frustrated some investors by blackballing numerous candidates for the position of chief operating officer before that search was suspended in June after about three months, according to people familiar with the matter. He and the other search-committee members each get one vote, and Uber\u2019s board is striving for a unanimous decision though it isn\u2019t necessary, said a person familiar with the matter. A strong chief executive prospect might balk at taking Uber\u2019s top job without unanimous board support.SoftBank, which shares a board member with Uber in       Yasir Al Rumayyan,        head of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund, approached the San Francisco company in recent weeks with a possible multibillion investment offer.A massive capital injection would help a new chief executive sustain the company\u2019s breakneck growth, which led to losses of more than $3 billion last year.But Uber isn\u2019t exactly in need of a big capital infusion with some $7 billion in cash on hand, and recently it has shown signs it could retreat from fiercely competitive markets. It did so this month in Russia when it combined its operations with Yandex.Taxi, and last year in China in joining with Didi Chuxing Technology Co.SoftBank is a big investor in three of Uber\u2019s Asian rivals, including Singapore\u2019s GrabTaxi Holdings Pte., which some investors view as a likely merger candidate for Uber in Southeast Asia.Uber\u2019s accelerated search timeline of about 2\u00bd months\u2014chief executive searches typically run about three to six months\u2014befits a company that embraced the Silicon Valley ethos to \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d in becoming the world\u2019s most highly valued private company. But Uber faces challenges including repairing the company\u2019s tarnished reputation after a series of scandals this year and a continuing lawsuit over what rival             Alphabet Inc.       alleges was the theft of self-driving car trade secrets.\u201cThey\u2019re in desperate need of a culture change and that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said       Steve Nilsen,        a partner at executive search firm Boyden.\u2014Thomas Gryta contributed to this article.Write to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.com and Joann S.

The woman seems uncommonly excited about the encounter, showering Maria with extraordinary compliments. And then all is explained when she invites Maria to take the notorious personality test administered by the Church of Scientology.It\u2019s at this point that most people would hurl themselves into, if not in front of, the next arriving train. But Maria has a fascination with cults. She happens to be completing a dissertation on the ethnomusicology of the Peoples Temple in Jonestown. And she herself belongs to a group that, Ms. Senna suggests, can feel much like an exclusive social order: Both she and her fianc\u00e9 Khalil are biracial. In the eyes of others their beige skin is the consummation of enlightened racial attitudes. \u201cMaybe she and Khalil are some kind of solution,\u201d she thinks, \u201cthe beautiful blend that happens four hundred years after humanity\u2019s collision.\u201d The two have been selected to star in a documentary called \u201cNew People\u201d about the future of American coupledom. When Maria wonders why their wedding announcement is being featured in the New York Times, Khalil answers, only half joking, \u201cWe\u2019re mulatto. Everybody loves mulattos. Nobody will grow bored of us, ever.\u201dA charmed future seems to lie ahead: \u201cA Brooklyn brownstone, a tribe of butterscotch dream children, a fancy tenure-track job.\u201d But Maria is having severe doubts about her membership in the tribe. Her pre-wedding jitters have taken the form of a ruinous obsession with a writer friend of Khalil\u2019s she thinks of only as \u201cthe poet.\u201d The poet isn\u2019t a New Person\u2014he\u2019s \u201cold-school,\u201d meaning he\u2019s simply a black guy, someone who endures the slights and persecutions that come with his skin color but feels no confusion about who he is.Maria\u2019s confusion is central to the breakdown that follows her obsession, and Ms. Senna deftly draws it out in the way of an espionage thriller, peeling back her characters\u2019 racial personas as though they were so many disguises. During the Scientology personality test, Maria realizes she has no idea how to answer the question \u201cCan you remember a time when you were really real?\u201d She was raised on       Whitney Houston       and LL Cool J and now she watches \u201cSeinfeld\u201d reruns every night. Khalil grew up a preppie\u2014\u201cthe only black guy at the frat party\u201d\u2014before undergoing a road-to-Damascus conversion in which he embraced his blackness and changed his clique of friends. The frankness with which \u201cNew People\u201d treats race as a kind of public performance is both uncomfortable and strangely cathartic.Being a performance, it transforms easily into deception, and the story hinges on two hallucinatory sequences in which Maria falsifies her identity in order to sneak into the poet\u2019s apartment. The ending of this brittle, provocative novel carries the fated sense of a utopia heading inexorably toward collapse.Christopher Swann\u2019s       first novel, \u201cShadow of the Lions\u201d (Algonquin, 356 pages, $26.95), takes place in another closed society prone to delusions of self-importance, an elite Virginia prep school called Blackburne. Our narrator, Matthias Glass, was a cocky upperclassman at Blackburne when his roommate Fritz suddenly went missing. Extensive investigations turned up no trace of him. The disappearance remains unexplained 10 years later when Matthias, now a washed-up novelist facing insolvency in New York, takes a one-year position teaching English at his alma mater.As a student, Matthias once cheated on a test and he irrationally fears that knowledge of the peccadillo prompted Fritz to run away. Now back on campus, he guiltily takes up the search for his friend, desperately hoping \u201cto find the narrative that made sense of the facts.\u201d His amateur sleuthing puts him in contact with an assortment of local law enforcement officers and Blackburne staff and alums, with some unexpectedly nefarious figures among them.Mr. Swann spins out an enjoyable little potboiler from this premise, and his ending comes alive with action and intrigue. What\u2019s most memorable about the book, however, is its expos\u00e9 of the dishonorable behavior hidden inside the ivy-covered walls of an institution that prides itself on its honor code. Mr. Swann makes a few half-hearted gestures at portraying the camaraderie and self-worth fostered at Blackburne, but like countless prep school novels before it, \u201cShadow of the Lions\u201d exudes an odor of rot. What is it about wealth and privilege that smells so strongly of death?The presiding absence in       Kristen Iskandrian\u2019s       debut is the unnamed mother of the novel\u2019s 18-year-old narrator, Agnes. As \u201cMotherest\u201d (Twelve, 279 pages, $26) opens, Agnes has started her freshman year at college and her mother has gone off the map, part of a continued reaction to the death of her son, Simon, Agnes\u2019s brother, some years earlier. But as her daughter observes, this woman was a remote figure in the best of times (\u201cEven as you entered a room, you were already halfway out of it\u201d), and Agnes has learned to cope with the desertion by keeping up a vigorous pen-pal correspondence\u2014\u201cThough \u2018pen pal\u2019 suggests a back-and-forth that\u2019s impossible here,\u201d she forlornly admits.Ms. Iskandrian divides each chapter between these letters and sharp first-person depictions of the hedge maze of college life, as Agnes navigates the usual obstacles of roommates and romance. Timorous and passive in her everyday interactions, she\u2019s an unfailingly witty chronicler of her unhappiness. \u201cI feel a general lack of volition,\u201d she writes as she falls into a relationship with a callow classmate. \u201cBeing filled with emptiness is its own kind of being full.\u201dFullness arrives in an unplanned way when Agnes becomes pregnant from the fling shortly before getting dumped. Choosing to keep the baby\u2014\u201cI want to possess and be possessed. I don\u2019t like giving away and I don\u2019t like cutting out\u201d\u2014she moves back home with her overwhelmed father and prepares to raise a child in the rooms haunted by the phantoms of her brother and mother.It\u2019s a rewarding turn of events. One of the better trends of recent fiction, exemplified by novels like       Elisa Albert\u2019s       \u201cAfter Birth\u201d and       Pamela Erens\u2019s       \u201cEleven Hours,\u201d is that pregnancy and childbirth are being treated as the epic subjects they plainly are, and that have been neglected largely out of squeamishness. \u201cMotherest\u201d transforms from a smart but broody meditation on abandonment into an emotionally brimming story of new life and new responsibility. It becomes saturated with hope, a thing Agnes calls \u201cthat most violent softness\u201d\u2014which is also a wonderfully apt way of describing a baby.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-sacks-on-the-best-new-fiction-1501269726", "keywords": ["bookcar0729,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:16:00", "news_title": "Treasury, IRS Delay Part of Rule on Corporate Tax Avoidance ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service delayed part of an Obama-era rule intended to combat corporate tax avoidance, giving companies an additional 12 months to comply with regulations requiring them to document internal loans.The decision, announced Friday, gives companies a reprieve while the Trump administration considers whether to amend or withdraw the broader regulations, which were designed to fight earnings stripping. That is a practice that multinational corporations use to lower their U.S. tax bills. They load up U.S. subsidiaries with intracompany debt and make deductible interest payments that effectively push profits to lower-tax countries.The Obama administration finished the rules in October 2016. They were the most controversial part of the government\u2019s attempt to curb corporate inversions, transactions in which U.S. companies took foreign addresses, often through mergers.The rules, citing broad powers granted by Congress under Section 385 of the tax code, would reclassify some internal debt as equity investments, ruining the potential tax benefits for companies. The documentation section of the regulations was meant to urge companies to make bona fide internal loans and to help the IRS to enforce the regulations.Instead of filing documentation about their internal loans starting in January 2018, companies will have until January 2019 to comply, according to Friday\u2019s notice from the IRS.The earnings stripping regulations were one of eight items the Trump administration identified this month as part of its deregulatory efforts.

Joe Barton (R., Texas). \u201cBut hope springs eternal.\u201dThe party\u2019s leaders remain optimistic, and there are reasons to think a tax overhaul could be easier than health care.\u00a0Republicans have more common ground, ideologically, and they won\u2019t be quite as bedeviled by Senate rules complicating passage of nonfiscal legislation. And the White House has been articulating clearer principles and showing deeper, more consistent interest.The so-called Big Six\u2014a team of negotiators from the Senate, House and Trump administration\u2014released a set of principles\u00a0Thursday\u00a0that entailed lower tax rates and simplification of the tax code while omitting the House\u2019s \u201cborder adjustment\u201d plan for taxing business income. A border-adjusted tax would have exempted exports while taxing imports.The Business Roundtable, a group of corporate leaders that had largely sat on the sidelines because its members were divided on border adjustment, announced a multimillion-dollar ad campaign\u00a0on Friday\u00a0aimed at making the case that lower corporate tax rates would boost economic growth.\u00a0Conservative groups that had criticized border adjustment, including those tied to the billionaire Koch brothers, are working more closely with the administration. Representatives from the groups\u00a0are holding a public event in Washington\u00a0on Monday\u00a0to promote the tax plan alongside Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       and White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short.However, not far beneath that newfound unity are some tough realities.In the coming months Congress may take another stab at a health-care overhaul, and lawmakers will soon confront deadlines on spending and the debt limit\u00a0that will distract them. Congress hasn\u2019t rewritten the tax code in 31 years because the task\u00a0is hard, demands\u00a0unpleasant trade-offs and sows divisions that\u00a0are often more parochial than partisan.\u00a0For example, some Republicans oppose tax breaks for renewable energy, but representatives from states with wind and solar energy disagree.Distrust lingers between senators and House members. And while Republicans may agree on the broad strokes of tax policy\u2014such as lower rates and lighter taxes on U.S. companies\u2019 foreign income\u2014they are bound to divide on the details.\u201cIt\u2019s going to take patience to do the right thing,\u201d said Rep. Mike Bishop (R., Mich.) \u201cIf you want to get it right, you\u2019ve got to take your time to do it. I\u2019m not equipped with this kind of patience. It\u2019s a learned thing.\u201dPresident Donald Trump says he wants to prioritize taxes for middle-class families, but his plan features tax cuts for businesses and high-income households. In an interview this past week, he knocked down speculation of a top ordinary income-tax rate exceeding 40%. \u201cThat was not right,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was not a correct statement.\u201dRepublicans don\u2019t agree on whether they are aiming for tax cuts or for a plan that would be revenue-neutral. They probably need an answer to that question\u00a0before voting on a tax bill, because that decision must be baked into the congressional budget. A budget unlocks the so-called reconciliation procedures that would allow the Senate to pass a tax bill with only Republican votes.\u201cThey can\u2019t have spent all these years pontificating about deficits and debt and then embrace huge tax cuts that only contribute to debt,\u201d said Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass), the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. He and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) urged a bipartisan approach on taxes. Mr. Schumer has warned that a partisan tax bill would end in the same place as the failed Senate health-care bill.The positive\u00a0reaction to the Big Six\u2019s statement of principles\u00a0Thursday\u00a0from retailers, manufacturers and technology companies papers over the many hard choices that have been postponed until the fall. A tax system like the one Republicans envision, in which deductions vanish to pay for lower tax rates, will yield new winners and losers, and not every group will be happy.\u201cThey have to recognize that whatever plan they come up with, the moment it hits the desk for a markup and goes public, there\u2019s going to be controversy over something,\u201d said economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum. \u201cThe famous line of Mike Tyson applies here. Everyone has a plan until they get hit. And they\u2019re going to get hit.\u201dThe health-care\u00a0overhaul\u00a0was supposed to repeal taxes on health industries and investment income. With those taxes remaining, Republicans must decide whether to include those provisions in the tax bill or set them aside.Rep.       Kevin Brady,        chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,\u00a0said\u00a0Friday\u00a0that\u00a0he didn\u2019t want to import\u00a0provisions to repeal\u00a0the\u00a0Affordable Care Act\u2019s taxes\u00a0into the\u00a0upcoming\u00a0tax bill because that would make it harder to lower other tax rates.Republicans also need to find a replacement for border adjustment, which would have raised about $1 trillion over a decade to pay for lower rates and discouraged companies from shifting profits abroad.\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0statement hinted at an emerging \u201cviable\u201d option.\u201cAs I\u2019ve always said, without border adjustment it means you\u2019re going to have a lot higher rates, and I think it makes it complicated to solve the overseas issues,\u201d said Rep.       Devin Nunes       (R., Calif.).With border adjustment gone and some other major changes proposed by the House looking less likely, the GOP tax effort may be more concentrated on tax rates and simplification, said Rep. Kenny Marchant (R., Texas).\u00a0That\u2019s still a tall order, he said.\u201cIt looks to me at this point the Senate needs some very straightforward-type stuff to vote on,\u201d Mr. Marchant said.Rep. Tom Reed (R., N.Y.) said the health-care failure showed the need to be open to what he called \u201cPlan B.\u201d\u201cMaybe we look at a situation where it\u2019s 51 senators, regardless of what party they\u2019re from, and we put a coalition together of the governing who want to solve problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to me that could be a winning combination rather than just going shirts and skins.\u201d\u2014Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) is the Senate minority leader.

Across six generations, until their precipitous 18th-century decline, the Mughals conquered much of the subcontinent and synthesized Central and South Asian aesthetic, spiritual and social traditions, leaving behind splendid miniature paintings, exquisitely proportioned tombs and fresh-as-paint chronicles of court life.By Audrey TruschkeStanford, 136 pages, $19.95The first Mughal emperor,       Babur,        wrested power from the Lodi dynasty in 1526 and wrote one of the world\u2019s outstanding memoirs; the second, Humayun, rallied from defeat and exile to restore Mughal sovereignty in 1555; the third, Akbar, promoted an exemplary religious syncretism, abolishing the poll tax for non-Muslims in 1564; the fourth, Jahangir, was Mughal portraiture\u2019s keenest patron and connoisseur; and the fifth,       Shah Jahan,        built Delhi\u2019s Red Fort and the Taj Mahal. His son,       Aurangzeb,        the last of the so-called great Mughal emperors, whose reign spanned nearly 50 years (1658-1707), enlarged the empire\u2019s borders to their furthest extent. Yet today Aurangzeb is remembered for razing Hindu temples, forcibly converting nonbelievers and banning music outright. In \u201cAurangzeb: The Life and Legacy of India\u2019s Most Controversial King,\u201d       Audrey Truschke,        of Rutgers University, re-examines the evidence and questions the severity of the verdict.Aurangzeb\u2019s formative years were shaped by the bloody, fratricidal dynamic of Mughal succession, with childhood competition among princes culminating in do-or-die struggles for kingship. (\u201cEither the throne or the grave,\u201d as the Persian saying went. Babur\u2019s advice to Humayun was decidedly more encouraging: \u201cThe world is his who hastens most.\u201d) So, from ages 16 to 38, Aurangzeb campaigned tirelessly abroad, gaining martial and administrative experience while his eldest brother,       Dara Shukoh,        in Ms. Truschke\u2019s telling, \u201cleisured at court\u201d and basked in their father\u2019s favor. In September 1657, Shah Jahan \u201cawoke gravely ill\u201d and failed to appear before his subjects. He would live for an additional nine years, but hastily spread rumors of his demise brought the long-simmering rivalry between Aurangzeb and his three brothers to its lurid conclusion.A staggered series of victories delivered Aurangzeb the throne\u2014and provoked controversy. He had his brother Dara paraded through Delhi in rags and beheaded; ordered Dara\u2019s son,       Sulayman,        overdosed on opium water; double-crossed and executed his youngest brother, Murad; and imprisoned his father in Agra Fort for the remainder of his life. Ruthlessly snuffing out rival claimants wasn\u2019t necessarily unusual; shunting one\u2019s father aside was. As Ms. Truschke acknowledges, this unjust and unnatural betrayal \u201chaunted\u201d Aurangzeb\u2019s rule.Pious, teetotal and painfully earnest, Aurangzeb felt the weight of his responsibilities keenly. Not for nothing had Babur warned that \u201cthere is no bondage like the bondage of kingship.\u201d Aurangzeb practiced an austere and, by most accounts, impartial brand of justice and prosecuted overreaching, Pyrrhic wars, attempting to subdue the Marathas, Hindu warriors from what is now the state of Maharashtra, and the recalcitrant kingdoms of the Deccan plateau. To this end, he relocated his court south to the Deccan in 1681, where it remained until his death in 1707.By contemporary standards, Aurangzeb\u2019s record leaves something to be desired. In 2015, his name was removed, with tellingly little dissent, from an important Delhi thoroughfare. All the more reason, Ms. Truschke contends, why we should judge him by his lights and those of his time. Aurangzeb destroyed, in Ms. Truschke\u2019s estimation, only \u201ca few dozen [temples] in total,\u201d belying his reputation for systematic Hindu oppression (though, in Varanasi and elsewhere, Aurangzeb targeted particularly sacred sites); he employed more Hindu officials than any other Mughal emperor; and he didn\u2019t ban music, merely regulating select types at court. On these points and others, Ms. Truschke argues with wit and enthusiasm, even if the latter occasionally runs away with her.The oft-repeated story of 14-year-old Aurangzeb coolly spearing an elephant, which Ms. Truschke relates without qualification, seems dubious or at least exaggerated. It\u2019s possible\u2014just as it\u2019s possible that Kim Jong Il really invented the hamburger\u2014but smacks of the mythologizing she pushes up against elsewhere. The rub, above all, lies in the book\u2019s slender format\u2014not so much brevity itself as the glibness such brevity invites. Ms. Truschke\u2019s concision is admirable; the moral judgments she takes for granted, less so. Assertions that the Raj willfully bred communal mistrust (\u201cpositing timeless Hindu-Muslim animosity embodied the British strategy of divide and conquer\u201d) or that the Hindu right trades in ahistorical, divisive fictions may contain an element of truth; they nevertheless require unpacking. A like-minded readership tends to be assumed in \u201cAurangzeb,\u201d which is too bad. Liberal historians and readers might applaud Ms. Truschke\u2019s approach; those who stand to benefit most from her biography won\u2019t.The neglect and contempt the Mughals have lately suffered reflect present political symptoms more than past maladies. While their conquest of India was cynical\u2014Babur was drawn to plunder, not the climate or customs, which he disparaged\u2014and sometimes brutal, Mughal administration was, in certain respects, enlightened, rooted in the land and its people. The tragedy of partition can\u2019t be laid at Aurangzeb\u2019s door; nor were the Mughals alien overlords bent on Hindu persecution. Inasmuch as he did away with formal court histories, Aurangzeb is himself partly to blame for the paucity of sources and uninformed attacks on his character. Ms. Truschke\u2019s \u201cAurangzeb\u201d will go some way toward his rehabilitation, yet there is more work to be done.\u2014Mr. Carter is the head of the Impressionist and modern art department at Christie\u2019s in New York.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/last-of-the-great-mughal-emperors-1501269181", "keywords": ["bookcar0729,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:06:00", "news_title": "Athens Today and Yesterday", "content": "During the Greek War of Independence (1821-32), the Ottoman Turks held the Acropolis in Athens. Running short of ammunition, they supposedly threatened to melt down the lead-coated iron clamps that held the Parthenon\u2019s columns together. The Greek fighters below, horrified at the threat of destruction, negotiated to send them more ammunition, with the message: \u201cHere are bullets, don\u2019t touch the columns.\u201dJohanna Hanink       relates the story a few chapters into \u201cThe Classical Debt,\u201d which cleverly connects Western Europe\u2019s investment in ancient Greek origins with the decade-old Greek debt crisis. Ms. Hanink is an associate professor of classics at Brown who in 2014 lived in Thessaloniki. Her stay coincided with an exciting\u2014or nerve-racking\u2014time to be in Greece, on edge and on the cusp of dramatic changes. \u201cGrexit\u201d was in the air. Would Greece leave the euro and return to the drachma? Elections in January of 2015 swept Syriza, the Coalition of the Radical Left, and its young, untried leader,       Alexis Tsipras,        to power on the slogan of \u201cHope Is Coming.\u201d By July, they had painted themselves into a corner with their creditors, and Mr. Tsipras called a referendum.By Johanna HaninkBelknap/Harvard, 337 pages, $29.95While the referendum was worded in such a way as to mean different things to different people, the resounding \u201cNo\u201d vote was interpreted as a rejection of punitive bailout conditions. Head-spinningly, within days of this populist victory, Mr. Tsipras capitulated to even more severe demands than had just been on offer; Greek banks went into capital controls, allowing the withdrawal of only 420 euros a week; and pensioners queued up weeping at bank branches. Ms. Hanink found, in short, that she knew actual Greeks who were suffering in the crisis\u2014people who had lost their jobs or whose jobs had simply stopped paying. She became (as this book demonstrates) involved.But back to the Parthenon story. When Ms. Hanink related the anecdote to her Modern Greek teacher, he accused her of na\u00efvet\u00e9. \u201cWhy,\u201d he asked, would the Greeks have \u201creadily given such aid\u201d to their Turkish foes? Ms. Hanink responded (with echoes of John 3:16), \u201cbecause they loved the Parthenon so much that they would rather lose the whole Acropolis than see it destroyed.\u201d \u201cWrong!\u201d the teacher said. They did it because \u201cforeigners love stuff like that, and they knew that if they played the part of good Hellenes, the Europeans would send them money.\u201d She found both the story and his reaction illuminating.In the classical era, Ms. Hanink argues convincingly, Athenians systematically set out to persuade not only themselves but also the world (and posterity) that they were exceptional. The Spartans may have been valiant on their suicide mission at Thermopylae, but it was the Athenians who held off the Persian invasion at Marathon and at Salamis in 480 B.C. For this, all Greece owed Athens, and Athens would not let them forget it. Byron, millennia later, distills this notion in verses about Marathon and Salamis from \u201cDon Juan\u201d: \u201cFor standing on the Persians\u2019 grave / I could not deem myself a slave.\u201dEven today, a few iconic columns are visual shorthand for Democracy, Justice, the Rule of Law. (The book is richly illustrated with cartoons and magazine covers, as well as images of Athens through the centuries.) Yet the Parthenon is less a monument to democracy than an advertisement for empire, the massive fore-gates to the Acropolis framing the view to Salamis and promoting the Athenian victory there (a brilliant insight put forth in 2012 by the scholars Samantha Martin-McAuliffe and       John Papadopoulos      ).Although other Greek cities and regions produced great art, Athenian philosophy, history and plays predominated, along with Attic, their particular flavor of Greek. Thus when Greek works were reintroduced to Western culture during the Renaissance, they were already colored with the idea of Athenian exceptionality and an indebtedness that could never be paid off. Meanwhile, the Greeks themselves had fallen under the Ottoman \u201cyoke\u201d and seemed to exist in a state of degradation and ruin. As a result, when it comes to modern Greece, the West ends up with a marble chip on its shoulder. When contemporary Greeks fail to live up to their glorious ancestors, Ms. Hanink argues, they are the ones who are compelled to repay, with interest, not only in actual money but in punitive austerity measures. As one Greek cartoonist has quipped when asked about the future of the country: \u201cWe have a great past. You can\u2019t ask for everything.\u201dMs. Hanink plots a convincing argument over the course of centuries that Greece and the rest of Europe have been lashed together in a \u201ccomplex push-and-pull that constantly interweaves . . . the relative values of money, history and culture.\u201d She is excellent on ancient Athens; this book might have been titled \u201cThe Athenian Debt,\u201d since she has much less to say about non-Athenian Greeks. Laconophilia (being wild for all things Spartan) comes in for barely a paragraph, although the British public school system, that builder of empire, was in some sense modeled on the Spartan ethos. Nor did the Athenians dream up out of nowhere the idea that things had been better in the past. The Boeotian poet Hesiod, at the very dawn of Greek letters, spoke of the five ages of man, descending from Gold to the present Iron, with a brief flash of glory in the generation preceding his own, the sons of Oedipus and the heroes of the Trojan War. The Homeric epics share the concern that things aren\u2019t what they used to be\u2014Hector can lift a huge stone with ease that the two of the strongest men \u201cof these times\u201d could scarcely budge with a wagon.Ms. Hanink is also very good on classical reception, and the history of Western travelers (and the occasional Ottoman) to Greece and their impressions. She is also masterly on the troubled birth of Hellas in the 19th century; on the disastrous loans to support Independence that British philhellenes secured from London at exorbitant interest, and with Greece itself as collateral; and the early history of the independent-but-only-on-European-terms early Greek nation-state (a regency with a Bavarian teenager on the throne).\u201cThe Classical Debt\u201d came out of an article that Ms. Hanink wrote in 2015 that took classicists wittily to task for their facile Greek tragedy metaphors. The book seems to have taken shape quickly, which might explain some unevenness as Ms. Hanink approaches the present. These flaws are mostly minor. Good on cultural debt, she is vaguer on the fiscal nuts and bolts and the bailouts, for example, mentioning the IMF only in passing and the European Central Bank not at all.Readers might also be leery of her comparisons of Islamic State\u2019s media-savvy destruction of antiquities at Palmyra, Syria, with Greece\u2019s heavy-handed use of a photograph of Nazi soldiers pulling ancient artifacts from the ground. Yes, both exploited images of antiquity for rhetorical purposes (the Greek Ministry of Defense was making a plea, doomed but not unfounded, for the Germans to pay war reparations and repay the loan they extracted from the Greeks during the Occupation). But the effect is tone-deaf in a book concerned with actual human suffering, especially considering that the Occupation is in living memory (my mother-in-law saw German tanks trundle down Athens\u2019s Patission Street) and that the human victims of Islamic State continue to fetch up daily on Greece\u2019s shores.Ms. Hanink is a classicist but also, although she might balk at the label, a philhellene. It is a mild irony that, though she criticizes \u201ctravelers\u201d who \u201cwere convinced that because of their classical education and personal passion for antiquity, they understood and appreciated Greece better than Greeks themselves could,\u201d she does not herself entirely escape the charge, if that is what it is, of a \u201cproprietary attitude toward Greece.\u201d She too wants to show the West what the Greeks are really like, as when she tells the story of her Greek tutor with his authentic, cynical reaction to her clich\u00e9d sentimentality.The Parthenon anecdote returns, some 60 pages later, with a twist. It turns out that the young Greek warrior in charge of the negotiations with the Ottomans was       Kyriakos Pittakis,        later an antiquities official for the new Greek state. As Ms. Hanink admits: \u201cBy all accounts . . . Pittakis really was tireless in his devotion to protecting antiquities.\u201d One contemporary recalled that when Pittakis saw people approach antiquities he became anxious, leaping \u201cover stick and stone to the place where the greatest danger threatened.\u201dCounterintuitively, even if the Acropolis story is apocryphal, elements of it are essentially true: Pittakis, a veteran of the War of Independence, cared about the Parthenon for itself and not as a way to cynically extort European money. The story, like most stories about Greece, is more complicated than it seems, escaping the author\u2019s attempt to allegorize it. Or maybe the allegory is there after all, Greeks continuing to send up bullets to those who have taken the high ground and laid claim to the columns.\u2014Ms. Stallings is an American poet and translator based in Greece.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/athens-today-and-yesterday-1501268781", "keywords": ["bookcar0729,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:03:00", "news_title": "Election Officials, Homeland Security Begin to Formalize Cybersecurity Efforts    ", "content": "Officials from a dozen states and the federal government took preliminary steps this week toward more formal cooperation regarding election-security efforts at a two-day meeting near Albany, N.Y.Attendees at the meeting Tuesday and Wednesday discussed coordinating information-sharing about potential cyberthreats among the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the Department of Homeland Security and state and local election offices. The meeting followed months of sometimes contentious back-and-forth between federal and state officials. State election officials of both political parties have criticized the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s decision in January to formally designate election systems \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201dFederal officials said the designation will help DHS place a higher priority on election-security efforts, amid reports of potential hacking attempts against election computer systems during the 2016 general election. But many state officials said they are worried about whether the sharing of sensitive cybersecurity information could occur in a two-way manner.Jim Condos,        Vermont\u2019s secretary of state and a Democrat, attended the meeting and said it facilitated \u201cbaby steps\u201d toward cooperation in safeguarding the election process.\u201cI think there is more clarity, but we still have a long way to go,\u201d said Mr. Condos, who also is president-elect of the National Association of Secretaries of State.The meeting was attended by state and local election officials from 12 states as well as EAC and DHS officials, according to a statement by the EAC. Representatives from several associations for government officials and technology experts also attended the meeting at the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which provides cybersecurity services to government entities.\u201cAmong the most notable next steps was preliminary agreement about the structure of the sector\u2019s coordinating council\u201d to facilitate planning, the EAC statement said. The preliminary plan is that a combination of state, local and federal officials would serve on the council, three meeting attendees said.In August 2016, DHS began offering cybersecurity assistance to state and local officials, after federal agencies detected potential hacking attempts against election systems. Systems used to tally votes weren\u2019t affected by any malicious cyber activity, federal and state officials said.By the November election, 33 states and 36 cities and counties had used DHS tools or sought advice from the agency,       Jeh Johnson,        the former Homeland Security Secretary, told the House Intelligence Committee on June 21.Last week, an association representing many state election officials sent a letter voicing concerns about the \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d designation to Homeland Security Secretary       John Kelly.\u201cSecretaries of State have been quite vocal in their frustration about the lack of transparency and clarity that has been provided on this new federal designation thus far,\u201d said the letter, sent by the National Association of Secretaries of States on July 20.A DHS spokesperson declined to comment directly on the letter, saying that the agency doesn\u2019t comment on correspondence to the secretary.\u201cGoing forward, we plan to work with Secretaries of State and senior election officials to determine how best to share this information while protecting the integrity of investigations and the confidentiality of system owners,\u201d a DHS official familiar with the matter said in a statement to the Journal.State and local officials are typically in charge of the operation of elections.The New York meeting was attended by state and local election officials from California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington, according to the EAC statement.\u201cAll of us at the federal level heard from those officials about the challenges,\u201d said EAC Chairman       Matthew Masterson,        who attended the meeting. \u201cI think there was a very candid conversation.\u201dWrite to Alexa Corse at alexa.corse@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/election-officials-homeland-security-begin-to-formalize-cybersecurity-efforts-1501268605", "keywords": ["computer systems,cooperation,cyberthreats,dhs,election security,homeland security,u.s. election assistance commission,political,general news,crime,legal action,privacy issues,information security,cybercrime,hacking,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,department of homeland security,executive branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 15:02:00", "news_title": "Raging Against the Machine", "content": "More than a decade before       Joe Strummer       of The Clash declared \u201canger can be power,\u201d       Bob Dylan       channeled the smoldering fury of generational revolt in his seminal 1965 hit, \u201cLike a Rolling Stone.\u201d \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d Mr. Dylan sneered, his nasal twang sounding to many listeners like a battle cry against bourgeois conformity. \u201cHow does it feel, to be on your own?\u201dIn \u201cGrown-Up Anger: The Connected Mysteries of Bob Dylan,       Woody Guthrie,        and the Calumet Massacre of 1913,\u201d author and songwriter       Daniel Wolff       blasts through layers of American history to uncover the rage animating Mr. Dylan\u2019s classic song, tracing its origins back through the life and music of Woody Guthrie and, even further, to a violent confrontation in Michigan decades before. Mr. Wolff\u2019s claim is that the death of dozens of striking copper miners and their children reverberates, like an earthquake\u2019s aftershocks, half a century later in Mr. Dylan\u2019s music. \u201cFollow that darkish vein back to find . . . what?\u201d he writes. \u201cThe history of anger. Hope. The truth.\u201d\u201cGrown-Up Anger\u201d is an associative\u2014rather than a chronological\u2014history, its narrative pieced together from seemingly disparate events and personalities. Tying together the book\u2019s various strands is another Dylan tune, \u201cSong to Woody,\u201d written several weeks after the aspiring songwriter arrived in New York in 1961 and visited Guthrie, who was confined to a New Jersey psychiatric hospital. He had been admitted with Huntington\u2019s chorea after his family could no longer take care of him. As Mr. Dylan later recalled: \u201cIt was one of them freezing days . . . a February Sunday night. . . . And I just thought about Woody, I wondered about him, thought harder and wondered harder. I wrote this song in five minutes.\u201dBy Daniel WolffHarper, 354 pages, $26.99In classic folk-singer tradition, Mr. Dylan borrowed the melody for \u201cSong to Woody\u201d from one of Guthrie\u2019s own songs, \u201c1913 Massacre,\u201d a haunting ballad about the death of dozens of Polish and Italian copper miners and their children in Calumet, Mich. Guthrie learned about the tragedy from Mother Bloor, a longtime labor activist and Communist Party member, who said that the massacre occurred at the newly built Italian Hall during a Christmas party when someone falsely shouted \u201cfire.\u201d The panicked crowd tried to flee, and 60 children and 13 adults were crushed to death. Guthrie\u2019s song, one of the saddest he ever wrote, begins with an invitation\u2014\u201cTake a trip with me in 1913\u201d\u2014but quickly adopts the voice of the grieving community: \u201cWe carried our children back up to their [Christmas] tree.\u201dWhat the song doesn\u2019t say outright is that the copper miners in Italian Hall were on strike and that whoever was responsible for yelling \u201cfire\u201d was almost certainly affiliated with the mining company. In the process of recounting this episode, \u201cGrown-Up Anger\u201d excavates America\u2019s long and often bloody history of labor strikes and union organization, implicitly arguing that these sporadic conflicts better capture the nation\u2019s democratic soul than the more familiar and triumphant accounts of upward mobility and material success. Along the way, we learn of the accidental discovery of copper in Michigan, its prompt seizure and exploitation by New England financiers, and the birth of the labor movement at various coal and copper mines throughout the country.Mr. Wolff populates his story with activists from early in the 20th century, including       Joe Hill,        the Swedish immigrant who became a popular cartoonist and songwriter for the Industrial Workers of the World (or Wobblies) and who was executed in 1915 after being falsely accused of murder in Utah. Also making appearances are the song collector Alan Lomax and folk icon       Pete Seeger,        both of whom aligned themselves with Popular Front radicals and worked on behalf of Depression-era unions.These juxtapositions prove remarkably fruitful. For instance, Mr. Wolff traces Mr. Dylan\u2019s \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d to Joe Hill\u2019s rhyming last will and testament: \u201cMy will is easy to decide / For there is nothing to divide / My kin don\u2019t need to fuss and moan / \u2018Moss does not cling to a rolling stone.\u2019 \u201d And he is especially good at recapturing the radical fervor that characterized much late 19th- and early 20th-century labor history\u2014a period when it seemed genuinely unclear whether capitalism or some brand of socialism would prevail as the American way of life.But \u201cGrown-Up Anger\u201d is at its best when discussing Guthrie and Mr. Dylan, especially the way in which each invited history to seep into his finest work. Both song writers were middle-class kids from the heart of the country. Both fashioned musical personae\u2014and voices\u2014that allowed them to distance themselves from their upbringings while identifying with America\u2019s poor and oppressed, whether African-American sharecroppers, immigrant copper miners, Okies or bums. As Guthrie told Lomax in a letter: \u201cMusic is some kind of electricity that makes a radio out of a man.\u201dIn telling their story, Mr. Wolff hopes to effect something similar\u2014to encourage his readers to reimagine American history as a continuing struggle to live up to its promise of equality of opportunity. What is not addressed in \u201cGrown-Up Anger\u201d is whether anger at social injustice is more effectively mobilized as political action or articulated by singular poets. Is the bracing outrage of \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d all that is left of the 20th century\u2019s various labor movements? Are popular songs capable of reawakening the struggle for workers\u2019 rights at a time when those rights are out of favor in the country?For Guthrie, the Calumet Massacre was one of countless injustices that fueled his vast corpus\u2014a body of work he hoped would chronicle \u201cthe struggle of working people in bringing to light their fight for a place in the America that they envisioned.\u201d For Mr. Dylan, anger would become detached from political movements by 1965, evolving into a deeply individual fury that lashed out with equal force against racism, war, the smug pieties of the folk movement and the betrayals of unnamed women.\u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d is now as remote from our time as the Calumet Massacre was from Mr. Dylan\u2019s when he wrote the anthem. Mr. Wolff\u2019s gripping account reminds us of an important, if submerged, reality of American life\u2014that the rich and powerful have often exploited labor in the name of economic freedom, upward mobility and (that most sacred word in the national lexicon) democracy. The story of the Calumet Massacre as it was passed along from Woody Guthrie to Bob Dylan is also a record of the gradual erosion and burying of hope for labor equality.\u2014Mr. Fuller is the       Herman Melville       Distinguished Professor of 19th-Century American Literature at the University of Kansas.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/raging-against-the-machine-1501268527", "keywords": ["bookcar0729,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 14:55:00", "news_title": "John Quincy Adams on Paper", "content": "John Quincy Adams (1767-1848) was the sixth president of the United States, chosen by the House of Representatives after the chaotic contest of 1824, crushed in his re-election bid by Andrew Jackson in 1828. But his public career stretched decades before and after his single term. His diplomat father, John Adams, took him on his first European trip when he was 10; he suffered a fatal stroke on the floor of the House of Representatives when he was 80. In the seven decades in between he served as ambassador to four countries, senator, secretary of state, congressman and advocate before the Supreme Court.He also kept a diary, with a juvenile start in 1779 called \u201cA Journal by Me, J Q A, Vol: 1st.\u201d It grew, as he entered adulthood, into an almost daily record. An electronic facsimile of this running autobiography, comprising 14,000 digitized pages of JQA\u2019s original handwriting, can be found at the website of the Massachusetts Historical Society.       David Waldstreicher,        professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, has distilled 1,200 pages of it, plus chronology and notes, into two volumes in the Library of America\u2019s handsome format. It will be the standard reader\u2019s edition of this masterpiece, which gives an account of both a fascinating life and a thrilling, disastrous period of American history.JQA is a masterly diarist. He could write in sentences and paragraphs, unlike modern politicians. (Sad!) His style is always clear, often elegant, informed by his reading in Latin, French and German (not Austrian). He has a sharp eye for people, things and places. While he was representing the United States in St. Petersburg he described a Russian Orthodox baptism: \u201cAnother singularity was that at one part of the ceremony they were all required to spit on the floor.\u201d Throughout his life, he noted sunrises (he himself typically rose at 4 a.m.), sunsets and eclipses.Edited by David WaldstreicherLibrary of America, 1,488 pages, $75Although public affairs consumed him, he had a variety of quirky interests and habits. He had a garden at home in Quincy, Mass., where he tried to start the seedlings of trees, usually with no luck. When he was in Washington he swam (he called it \u201cbathing\u201d) in the Potomac; he once nearly drowned, and on another occasion saw a drowned body pulled from the river. He was forever writing verse, and scolding himself for its poor quality. \u201cIt is with poetry as with Chess and Billiards\u2014There is a certain degree of attainment, which labour and practice will reach, and beyond which no vigils and no vows will go.\u201dHis signal deficiency as a chronicler is that he had almost no sense of humor. Whatever seriousness was not drilled into him by his Puritan heritage, history and Adams family history supplied. When he was 7 he saw the smoke and heard the cannon of the Battle of Bunker Hill across Boston Harbor; his childhood friends were heroes\u2014      Benjamin Franklin,       Thomas Jefferson       and Lafayette; his father, the second president, was the hero at home. The private history of the Adams family was somber: JQA\u2019s two brothers, and two of his three sons, were alcoholics.The gusto that sunnier temperaments draw from humor, JQA got instead from bile. He knew everybody, and hated almost everybody. The diary is a cavalcade of vituperation:       Stephen Douglas       \u201ccast away his cravat, unbuttoned his waistcoat and had the awkward aspect of a half naked pugilist.\u201d       Daniel Webster       had \u201cgigantic intellect,\u201d \u201cenvious temper,\u201d \u201cravenous ambition\u201d and a \u201crotten heart.\u201d       Ralph Waldo Emerson       was \u201ca crack-brained young man.\u201d       Alexander Hamilton\u2019s       death in a duel was \u201cdivine retributive justice\u201d for his opposing JQA\u2019s father. He acknowledged Martin Van Buren\u2019s \u201ccalmness,\u201d \u201cgentleness of manners\u201d and \u201cconciliatory temper\u201d but flayed his \u201cobsequiousness,\u201d \u201csycophancy\u201d and \u201cfawning servility.\u201d The sternest rebuke was reserved for Jefferson, who \u201ccombined a rare mixture of infidel philosophy, and Epicurean Morals\u2014Of burning Ambition, and of Stoical self-controul\u2014of deep duplicity and of generous sensibility, between which two qualities and a treacherous and inventive Memory, his conduct towards his rivals and opponents appears one tissue of inconsistency.\u201d JQA ticked off some instances, then struck off this epigram: Jefferson had \u201ca memory so pandering to the will that in deceiving others he seems to have begun by deceiving himself.\u201dJQA had the vices that hobbled his father: wrath and aggression, cast as righteousness. \u201cMy cause is the cause of my Country, and of human liberty. It is the cause of Christian improvement\u2014the fulfilment of the prophesies.\u201d His canting rage was stoked by the punishments he administered to himself: for being a mediocre poet; for getting up as late as 6 a.m.; for reading for pleasure when he should have been doing research; for a hundred shortcomings, almost all of them magnified by relentless self-scrutiny. Back of the implacable internal judge lay a profound internal fear: I am not worthy\u2014of my father; of the founding fathers; of the opportunities I have been given. Sometimes sheer loss released him from the prison of himself, if only into grief: The death of his mother, and of his drunkard sons, touched him to the core. And day by day, poems, plants and heavenly bodies momentarily soothed him, even if he called them distractions. Otherwise the vise of his personality stayed tight.Much of Volume I is taken up with JQA\u2019s career as a diplomat. His crowning achievement was his part in procuring the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812. JQA belonged to a five-man American negotiating commission, which also included the young       Henry Clay.       The shuffling and bluffing of their British counterparts, and their own internal bickering, shows how the sausage of a treaty gets made. There is unintentional comedy in the clash of JQA\u2019s earnest temperament with that of the smiling, spouting Clay; Clay\u2019s all-night card parties broke up just when JQA was starting his day.In 1817 James Monroe tapped JQA to be secretary of state. Monroe\u2019s eight years in the White House became the original permanent campaign as Adams, Treasury Secretary       William Crawford,        Secretary of War John C.       Calhoun,        House Speaker Clay and Gen. Andrew Jackson jockeyed to succeed him. JQA\u2019s account of these years, which straddles Volumes I and II, is the ultimate inside baseball. (JQA learned that, at one point, a frustrated Crawford, seeing his chances slip away, threatened to beat Monroe with his cane.) It is a tribute to JQA\u2019s public-spiritedness that in the midst of these brawls he crafted the principle of mutual European/American non-interference, known as the Monroe Doctrine, that would guide our foreign policy for 90 years.JQA beat his competitors for the White House and served a damp term as president. The most important subject in the diary\u2014much more important than this sterile victory\u2014is slavery.Joseph Ellis       believes that John Adams, at the end of his life, told JQA that the founders of the North had made a tacit bargain with their brothers of the South: End slavery in your own way. Since the South hadn\u2019t done so, it would be fair, and necessary, for JQA to push hard against it.I see an earlier turning point in the diary, after Missouri applied for statehood in 1819. The House, dominated by free states, wanted Missouri to be free; the Senate, split between free and slave states, balked.JQA recorded a conversation he had with Calhoun in March 1820, as the two walked home from a cabinet meeting at which Missouri had been the topic. JQA had argued for freedom, citing the Declaration of Independence. Calhoun, who was from South Carolina, told him \u201cthat the principles which I had avowed were just and noble; but that in the Southern Country, whenever they were mentioned, they were always understood as applying only to white men.\u201d Slavery, he went on, had \u201cmany excellent consequences. . . . It was the best guarantee to equality among the whites.\u201dJQA wrote it all down, then ruminated: \u201cWhen probed to the quick,\u201d slaveholders \u201cshow at the bottom of their Souls, pride and vain-glory in their very condition of masterdom. . . . They look down upon the simplicity of a yankey\u2019s manners because he has no habits of overbearing like theirs, and cannot treat negroes like dogs.\u201dThe power of this encounter comes from the fact that, at that moment, Calhoun was one of the few people JQA respected. \u201cCalhoun thinks for himself,\u201d he wrote, \u201cindependently of all the rest.\u201d If, even so, he thought as he did, what hope was there for the country? You might as well jump straight to Antietam.JQA did nothing with this prophetic insight\u2014he still had the greasy pole of ambition to climb. But after winning and losing the presidency, then taking a brief time-out in private life, he returned to politics, winning a House seat in 1830, and the slavery issue returned to him. The climax of Volume II is his double resistance to the annexation of Texas, a future slave state, and to the gag rule, which required anti-slavery petitions to the House to be tabled, unread and unrecorded. His struggle against the latter employed all his qualities, bad and good: he was bitter, resourceful, smart and brave. He gave orations, and he wrangled over points of order. What rendered his campaign all the more splendid were the rants and threats of his slave-holding opponents. In that long-ago conversation with Calhoun he had seen their nature, and he forced them to show it again and again.The gag rule went down in 1844, but Texas was annexed the following year; the road to disunion and war ran clear and straight.

By its 50th anniversary, in 1946, this slim collection had gone through 48 editions in Britain, making       Grant Richards,        the publisher, a rich man and       A.E. Housman       (1859-1936) a famous one. In the United States, it was sold in many pirated editions with the author\u2019s tolerant acquiescence until its first authorized American publication, in 1922.Housman\u2019s melancholy lyrics of lost love and early death, set in an imagined Eden of rural England, are among the most familiar poems in English, often quoted and set to song, memorized by generations of schoolchildren, and carved in the stone of village war memorials. By one reckoning, Housman\u2019s lapidary phrases have been used as titles for more books than any other source except the Bible and       Shakespeare.       From the start, \u201cA Shropshire Lad\u201d was a cultural more than a literary phenomenon.       George Orwell       called Housman \u201cthe writer who had the deepest hold upon the thinking young,\u201d; at Eton, he said, he memorized the whole of the \u201cLad,\u201d adding \u201cthese are the poems that I and my contemporaries used to recite to ourselves, over and over, in a kind of ecstasy.\u201d Poems such as \u201cTo an Athlete Dying Young\u201d unite a young man\u2019s dream of success and dread of failure in polished stanzas:Smart lad, to slip betimes away  From fields where glory does not stay  And early though the laurel grows  It withers quicker than the rose.In \u201cHousman Country,\u201d       Peter Parker,        the author of biographies of       Christopher Isherwood       and J.R. Ackerley, offers a sensitive, well-researched study of the poet and his time. He takes as his subject Housman\u2019s readers as much as the writer\u2014an extraordinarily broad mission, given the popularity of \u201cA Shropshire Lad.\u201d Mr. Parker is an unabashed enthusiast who makes a spirited case for the artistic merit of the work, all the more persuasive because he frankly concedes its limits.Housman\u2019s position as a literary giant was a part-time occupation; he held down a day job as one of the most eminent classical scholars of his day. As its title makes explicit, Mr. Parker\u2019s book is not a biography, though his comprehensive sketch of Housman\u2019s life and publishing career, running to 135 pages, is a model of brief biography, detailed enough for most readers. Housman\u2019s life was as uneventful as that of most classical scholars, rarely ranging beyond the placid confines of universities. After an idyllic childhood in Worcestershire (near but not Shropshire), he studied at a school founded by       Edward VI       and in 1877 won a scholarship to St. John\u2019s College, Oxford, where he became an atheist and the most brilliant Latinist of his class. He got a first in \u201cMods,\u201d the preliminary undergraduate examination. His studies were entirely absorbed in the dry minutiae of textual scholarship; he scorned any interest in the philosophical and literary content.By Peter ParkerFarrar, Straus & Giroux, 530 pages, $30The great, almost the only, event in Housman\u2019s private life was an unrequited love for a roommate at Oxford named       Moses Jackson,        which would become a major source of the melancholy that pervades his poetry. Like all Housman biographers, Mr. Parker faces an insurmountable task in plumbing the murky depths of this passion, conceived during the high tide of Victorian moral hypocrisy, for the archival cupboard is nearly bare. From the tortured hints that survive, it would appear that Housman provoked a crisis in his friendship with Jackson by openly declaring his love and then suffered a breakdown of some sort.As a result of his emotional turmoil and disdain for studying anything that did not capture his fancy, Housman failed his final exam and did not earn a degree. To support himself, he passed the civil-service examination and took a post with a miserable salary at the patent office, where he could work alongside Jackson, who had a much better job there. Housman succeeded in repairing the breach, and the two men remained close friends even after Jackson moved to India and married (though he did not invite Housman to the wedding). Housman also stayed true to his classical vocation. He toiled nights and weekends at the British Library, writing a series of scholarly articles that brought the offer of a professorship at University College London in 1892. Nineteen years later, he was appointed to a named chair at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he remained until his death at age 77.Housman\u2019s life followed the paradigm of the cold, aloof don with a caustic wit and buried emotions. His brother, Laurence, a playwright and illustrator, was a leading campaigner for the acceptance of homosexuality, but Alfred led a solitary life, shunning public honors as resolutely as personal entanglements. His unsuspected passionate sensitivity emerged, fully blown, when \u201cA Shropshire Lad\u201d was published a month before his 37th birthday. Housman is almost unique among poets in that he published virtually no verse until midlife.The book\u2019s 63 poems (printed in full at the end of \u201cHousman Country\u201d) are short, most of them 20 lines or fewer, and remarkably homogeneous in style, composed in cantering iambs with perfect end rhymes. Vocabulary and syntax are spare and relatively simple. Remarkably, apart from a brief poem about Narcissus, the \u201cLad\u201d is devoid of specific classical or other literary allusions. Echoes of antiquity are there for the attentive reader:       Robert Lowell,        who said that Housman was the poet \u201cwho most moves me to tears,\u201d noted the affinity between Housman\u2019s \u201ciron quatrains\u201d and \u201cthe tomb inscriptions for the Athenian youths who died at Marathon.\u201d Housman\u2019s poetry constitutes a little self-sufficient world, perfect and changeless, which welcomes all readers regardless of their educational background. It might be noted that Housman said on many occasions that his poems were aimed at \u201cyoung men\u201d; the only female fan of note mentioned in \u201cHousman Country\u201d is       Willa Cather,        who called on Housman uninvited and found him \u201cthe most gaunt and gray and embittered individual\u201d she had ever met.\u201cA Shropshire Lad\u201d was enormously popular with soldiers in World War I; cheap editions of the book were found in the pockets of many men who died in battle. Yet by the war\u2019s end, modernism was the reigning mode, and Housman\u2019s elegies of doomed youth began to acquire a reputation as maudlin and dreary.       Ezra Pound       epitomized this contemptuous attitude in a parody, \u201cMr. Housman\u2019s Message,\u201d which begins:O woe, woe,  People are born and die,  We also shall be dead pretty soon  Therefore let us act as if we were  Dead already.In its earnest way, Housman\u2019s poetry is almost as remote and difficult of access to modern readers as Pound\u2019s \u201cCantos,\u201d a relic of an era when heartfelt sentiment sold books. Housman published a second collection, ominously titled \u201cLast Poems,\u201d in 1922, which is entirely continuous in theme and style with the \u201cLad.\u201d With his narrow range and indifference to experimentation and stylistic growth, Housman must be classed a minor poet, as even his most ardent admirers admit.Yet, as Mr. Parker demonstrates in his skillful, judicious analysis of the work, Housman\u2019s virtues as a poet are all too easily overlooked. There is, after all, a lot to be said for a perfect expression: The reader may ransack the poems for hours without finding a flaw, a prosodic bobble or a word slightly misused. Housman\u2019s message, too, has an enduring resonance, even if it becomes monotonous in a straight read-through. W.H. Auden, a major poet by any measure, was strongly under Housman\u2019s influence. In 1938, at the height of his powers, Auden wrote an elegy to Housman, and as late as 1972 he published a poem in the New Yorker that began: \u201cHousman was perfectly right: / our world rapidly worsens.\u201d\u201cHousman Country\u201d sets itself the goal of being the definitive study of the distinctively English culture that formed the poet\u2019s sensibility and the reciprocal imprint he left on that culture. This mission inspires Mr. Parker to embark on a series of merry excursions, such as brief disquisitions on country walks, English folk music, the evolving usage of the word \u201clad\u201d and as much information about the Morris-dancing revival as most readers will ever want. However, the pages devoted to Housman\u2019s cultural influence sink under the weight of their comprehensive intention.The book\u2019s weakest section is the one devoted to musical settings of Housman\u2019s verse. Hundreds of songs have set poems from the \u201cLad,\u201d and by the end of this long chapter the reader feels as though every one of them has been catalogued. Most of Housman\u2019s poems are untitled and thus are identified by the opening line, which makes sentences that list as many as 15 songs, including the composers\u2019 names and the dates of the first performances (and, in many cases, the musicians and venues), read like a long index entry. Mr. Parker has a fine talent for analyzing poetry but a meager gift for writing about music; frequently, he substitutes a complimentary phrase from a newspaper review for his own judgment.In its final chapter, \u201cHousman Country\u201d compiles an exhaustive collection of tidbits from popular culture that make reference to Housman\u2019s poetry. It is amusing to know that Shpetim Zogaj, a performer on \u201cAlbanians Got Talent,\u201d set \u201cWhen I was one-and-twenty\u201d to music, but when Mr. Parker goes on to enumerate commemorative plaques and record the auction price for the nameplate from a locomotive called A Shropshire Lad, and to compile stray quotations from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cInspector Morse,\u201d compendious becomes tedious.Yet despite these sporadic excrescences of zeal, \u201cHousman Country\u201d finally achieves its principal goal. Mr. Parker\u2019s labor of love is enriched by a remarkable breadth of research and is guided by keen intelligence, and only a foolhardy writer would have the hubris to undertake another book of its kind.\u2014Mr. James is the author of \u201cThe Glamour of Strangeness.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/housmans-world-in-miniature-1501267969", "keywords": ["bookcar0729,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,education,arts,entertainment,reviews,printing,publishing,media"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 14:12:00", "news_title": "American Airlines Profit Falls, But Revenue Rises", "content": "American Airlines Group Inc.\u2019s        AAL -0.32%       profit fell in the second quarter, even as the carrier said strong revenue and demand trends would lift performance through the rest of the year.American said second-quarter unit revenue, a closely watched measure of the amount taken in for each seat flown a mile, rose 5.7% annually.Unit revenue improved for most airlines in the quarter, breaking a yearslong slump in performance by that measure.             United Continental Holdings Inc.,Southwest Airlines Co.       and             Delta Air Lines Inc.       also reported improved second-quarter unit revenue this month thanks in part to wider fare and fee offerings.American said it expects unit revenue to increase up to 2.5% annually in the third quarter and possibly more in the fourth, in part because new no-frills fares and premium products are expected to boost revenue.\u201cWe are enthusiastic about our prospects for the second half of 2017,\u201d Chief Executive       Doug Parker       said in a news release.Mr. Parker, on an earnings call Friday, said his optimism about the fourth quarter was based not on data showing just 15% of seats already booked.

These cheaper tickets, also widely available from Delta and United, are a way for big airlines to selectively match prices offered by low-cost rivals while at the same time generating more revenue.Roughly half the customers who look at these low fares ultimately upgrade to a higher ticket price that includes some perks, according to American. The company, which offers Basic Economy in only 78 markets in the U.S. and Canada, said the typical up-sell is $23 a ticket.The largest U.S. airline by traffic has also launched a Premium Economy product on its international widebody flights. This separate cabin of 20 to 28 seats offers more perks than coach, but is less costly than business class. Premium Economy will be available on 77 planes by March of 2018 from 10 today. American said the typical buy-up by passengers is worth $400.Fort Worth, Texas-based American said its second-quarter profit fell despite a 7.2% increase in total revenue to $11.1 billion, from $10.4 billion a year ago. The gain was due in part to higher ticket pricing and improved business domestically and in Latin America. Revenue beat Wall Street estimates.Profit was $803 million, or $1.63 a share, down 15.5% from year-ago $950 million, or $1.68 a share. The decline was due to a jump in costs, mostly higher fuel and labor expenses. Excluding $205 million pretax in special items, American earned $944 million, or $1.92 a share, beating estimates.

XOM 0.92%       nearly doubled its second-quarter profit compared with a year ago, to $3.35 billion, and             Chevron Corp.        CVX 1.57%jacked up its bottom line to $1.45 billion.The gains came even as oil prices fell again in the quarter, dipping below $50 a barrel, and questions about future demand continue to weigh on producers, underscoring the dramatic transition under way in the industry to curb ambitions, cut costs and focus on smaller-scale opportunities.Friday\u2019s tallies echoed results at             Royal Dutch Shell        RDS.B 1.84%       PLC, Norway\u2019s             Statoil AS      A and France\u2019s             Total SA      . Collectively, the five energy companies this year are off to their best start since 2014, generating excess cash and profits that outstrip any two consecutive quarters in the past two years.They generated more than $30 billion in cash and managed to avoid sliding deeper into debt, an increasingly important barometer of an oil producer\u2019s ability to survive the crisis.In addition to cutting costs by tens of billions, many energy companies have reoriented their businesses toward projects that can be completed quickly and produce profits within a few years rather than after more than a decade of upfront, billion-dollar spending.\u201cFor us to compete and win,\u201d Exxon Vice President       Jeff Woodbury       told analysts on a call, \u201cwe have got to be the lowest cost-of-supply producer out there.\u201dWhile the sector\u2019s improved performance doesn\u2019t yet match precrash levels, it does back up executives who have told investors in the downturn that the largest Western producers can thrive in a lower-price era.\u201cThe companies are at different stages of learning how to deal with this low-price environment,\u201d said       Brian Youngberg,        an energy analyst at Edward Jones. \u201cThey will need to remained disciplined with their spending or investors will shun them.\u201dOil prices have risen recently to two-month highs on momentum furthered by recent inventory declines. Market observers have long said a sustained reduction in the amount of oil being stored would point to a partial price recovery as it would indicate greater demand. U.S. prices this week settled above the $49 mark for the first time since May 30.The push to a \u201cshort cycle\u201d strategy has helped companies such as Exxon, Chevron and Shell prepare for a world in which prices don\u2019t return to $100 a barrel for many years, if ever.Shell Chief Executive       Ben van Beurden       said Thursday that the company had adjusted to a world in which prices could remain \u201clower forever\u201d due to the potential for declining demand.While Exxon and Chevron don\u2019t share the view that falling oil demand is a threat to their business before 2040, the companies have nonetheless pivoted toward investments that pay off quickly, especially in the U.S.Through 2020, the U.S. units of big oil companies such as Exxon are expected to grow by about 7% a year, adding about 800,000 barrels a day of oil and gas production, largely from fracking operations in West Texas and deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, according to Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.One challenge is coaxing the same returns out of shorter-term projects that the companies enjoyed with high-price, multibillion-dollar developments. Both Chevron and Exxon lost money in their U.S. drilling operations in the quarter.Chevron said its land in West Texas and New Mexico could be worth as much as $50 billion. The company\u2019s wells in that area\u2014one of the hottest for drilling in the world\u2014can bring a 30% return, even including all associated costs such as overhead, said Executive Vice President Jay Johnson.\u201cWe continue to look for the next best development areas,\u201d he said Friday in a call with analysts. \u201cWe\u2019re using technology and the experience of others. And we are seeing continued improvement.\u201dExxon\u2019s second-quarter profit of $3.35 billion came to 78 cents a share; a year earlier, the company posted a profit of $1.7 billion, or 41 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting earnings of 84 cents a share in the latest period. Exxon shares fell 1.5% Friday, marking a nearly 12% decline for the year.Chevron\u2019s profit of $1.45 billion compares with a year-earlier loss of $1.47 billion, stemming largely from asset write-downs.

He soon realized that no one was buying cookies before noon, so he began to stock breakfast pastries from a small chain called Au Bon Pain. Mr. Shaich soon merged Au Bon Pain with his cookie company.Ten years later, in 1991, he took Au Bon Pain public. In 1993, Au Bon Pain acquired Saint Louis Bread Co. to form what is now Panera Bread. And on July 18, Mr. Shaich sold Panera for $7.5 billion in one of the biggest restaurant deals ever. His ownership of nearly 6% of the company\u2019s stock netted him an estimated $400 million pretax payout.Such a windfall once seemed unlikely. In 2010, Mr. Shaich, who had stepped down as Panera\u2019s CEO and became executive chairman, was worried enough about the soup-and-sandwich chain\u2019s trajectory that he drew up a \u201cpre-mortem\u201d to explain how a competitor could beat it. Walking into a Panera branch was like a \u201cmosh pit,\u201d he said. As lines and waits grew, customers often found ordering so frustrating that they would just leave. The company\u2019s growth slowed.Panera adopted the strategies that Mr. Shaich devised for its would-be competitors, such as Starbucks and Chipotle Mexican Grill. In 2012, he returned as CEO to help lead an overhaul known as Panera 2.0, including an estimated $100 million investment in better technology to speed up service. Last year, the firm\u2019s revenue grew to $2.8 billion, up from $2.7 billion in 2015.All 2,000 restaurants are now slated to get a new look, including sleeker drive-throughs and digital screens, and a menu of \u201cartisanal\u201d offerings that Panera says are preservative-free, including a steak and white-cheddar panini and a watermelon feta salad. Customers at revamped stores can now order on an iPad, and many can get deliveries at their homes or offices.The high-tech refurbishing of Panera is just the latest act for Mr. Shaich, a 36-year veteran of the restaurant business. This spring,         Whole Foods Market               named him to its board of directors, further increasing his influence in the food industry. Mr. Shaich, 63, will stay on as CEO of Panera and help guide its new owner, JAB Holding Co., a European investment fund that owns Krispy Kreme, Keurig Green Mountain and other food and retail chains.Growing up in Livingston, N.J., amid the social and cultural ferment of the 1960s, Mr. Shaich initially wanted to go into politics. The son of an accountant father and a homemaker mother, he went to Clark University, where he became treasurer of the student body. In that role, he opened a nonprofit convenience store. \u201cFor a kid who can\u2019t dance and can\u2019t sing\u2026this was the most creative thing I had ever done in my life,\u201d he laughs.After graduation, he went to Washington to work in campaign consulting\u2014and realized that he\u2019d rather start his own business. He attended Harvard Business School and then opened that first cookie store. Since then, he has been a keen observer of trends in the food industry.In the mid-1990s, he started seeing a move away from baked goods and ready-made sandwiches and toward healthier, fresher food. He noticed that while many customers once ordered their baguettes sliced crosswise in circular pieces, people were starting to ask to have the loaves sliced lengthwise to use for sandwiches. That made him think that customers wanted to come in for real meals, not just to buy baked goods on the run.Modern chains such as         McDonald\u2019s               once met that need for a more complete food experience, he says, but by the mid-1990s, fast-food restaurants had become \u201cself-service gasoline stations for the human body.\u201d Sensing an opening, Mr. Shaich became one of the founders of the \u201cfast-casual\u201d movement: restaurants that aim to provide fresh, high-quality food swiftly and affordably\u2014with a serving of self-esteem on the side.Over the years, he says, he began to see \u201cpeople waking up and saying, \u2018I want to feel special in a world in which I\u2019m not.\u2019 \u201d Panera, he concluded, answered that desire better than Au Bon Pain. So in 1999, he sold Au Bon Pain to focus on growing Panera into a fast-casual pioneer. As that market has become more competitive, with the Sweetgreen salad chain and       Tom Colicchio\u2019s       \u2019Wichcraft sandwich shops expanding nationally, Mr. Shaich is relying on his digital plan to compete by giving customers easier ways to get their lunches, including an app for advance orders.Mr. Shaich says that he hasn\u2019t thought about how to spend his enormous payout from the deal, but he plans to keep his current routine. When he isn\u2019t traveling, he wakes up at his home in Brookline, Mass., at 4:30 a.m., reads the news for 45 minutes and sees his fitness trainer three to four days a week. (\u201cMy favorite part of the trainer is saying goodbye,\u201d he says.) Afterward, he checks Panera sales and heads to work, stopping at a branch to pick up a Greek yogurt parfait and cappuccino before a day of meetings. After work, he likes to have dinner with his wife and their teenage son and daughter around 6:30 p.m.He hopes to use his family vacation this winter for another, more personal \u201cpre-mortem.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve watched both my mom and dad pass away and\u2026I learned we each have an opportunity if we have a chronic disease to reflect on our own lives,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m convinced that the time to reflect is not in the ninth inning, on your death bed.

While some individuals are members of interdisciplinary scientific consortia that have received EPA funding, not all of them have.Mr. Milloy employs misdirection when he argues recipients of EPA funds should be disqualified from being science advisers. He does not mention that many EPA advisers, like me, have also received research support from industry. Under EPA rules, a scientist cannot be disqualified for receiving industry or EPA support. Indeed, if industry support were grounds for disqualification, there would be zero EPA science advisers representing corporate America, including my Scientific Advisory Board colleague, Michael Dourson,       Donald Trump\u2019s       pick for the EPA\u2019s toxics chief.Mr. Milloy also implies there\u2019s a shortage of industry representatives among EPA\u2019s advisers. EPA boards contain a healthy mix of experts from regulated industries. For example, every SAB advisory panel includes significant and valuable industry representation. The recent fracking review panel had more than 200 years of collective industry experience.Finally, Mr. Milloy calls for tighter conflict-of-interest rules for EPA advisers.

Those payments are likely to be a major focus as the industry pushes Congress to pass legislation aimed at stabilizing the exchanges.What are cost-sharing reduction payments?The cost-sharing reductions, often referred to as CSRs, are subsidies\u00a0that help people who get health plans through the health law\u2019s exchanges and whose income is between 100% and 250% of the federal poverty level. The federal poverty level is around $12,000 for a single person. The subsidies reduce out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles for these people, potentially saving them thousands of dollars when they need health care. Under the ACA, the federal government is supposed to pay for the subsidies, at a cost estimated at around $7 billion this year.Why are the payments such a big deal for insurers?The federal cost-sharing payments don\u2019t go directly to the consumers who benefit from them. Instead, insurers effectively advance the money, making sure that people eligible for the subsidies don\u2019t have to pay their full deductibles. Then, the insurers are supposed to be reimbursed by federal payments. But if the federal money doesn\u2019t flow, the law forces the insurers to keep covering out-of-pocket charges on behalf of the low-income enrollees anyway. That money comes out of the insurers\u2019 own pockets and, companies say, could lead to severe financial losses.What will insurers do if the cost-sharing reduction payments stop?If the payments stop before the end of the year, insurers may try to immediately pull back their exchange plans to head off financial losses.\u00a0Under the contract that many signed with the federal exchange, HealthCare.gov, they have the right to pull out if the CSRs stop. But other laws, both at the federal and state level, may slow or block their exit, according to\u00a0      Timothy S.\u00a0Jost,        an emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University. Generally, insurers are required to give 90 days notice to consumers if they are going to stop offering a product, among other requirements, though this requirement may not apply if the product is still being offered outside the ACA marketplace.If the insurers know that the payments are set to stop next year, they may choose not to offer exchange plans for 2018. Alternatively, insurers say they would raise premiums to cover the extra cost of enrollees\u2019 out-of-pocket charges. The Kaiser Family Foundation has suggested those increases could amount to 19% on average for the marketplaces\u2019 middle-tier \u201csilver\u201d plans. Because federal subsidies cover much of the cost of premiums for people with lower incomes, a Kaiser analysis suggested that if the Trump administration stops the cost-sharing payments, federal costs will actually be higher overall due to the larger premium bills.Why is this an issue?The CSRs were the crux of a suit filed by House Republicans in 2014 that argued that lawmakers never appropriated funds for the payments, which thus shouldn\u2019t have been made by the Obama administration. Last year, a federal judge agreed with the GOP lawmakers, saying the payments were improper. The effects of the ruling were stayed, and the payments continued, while the Obama administration appealed.What is happening now?The Trump administration hasn\u2019t declared a stance in the continuing legal suit, instead repeatedly requesting delays. President Donald Trump has threatened to halt the payments.\u00a0Insurers want Congress to officially allocate the money and lock in the funding, which may never be completely secure otherwise because of the court ruling that threw their legitimacy into question.Insurers must file rates by mid-August and make final decisions about participation by late September. Without certainty on the future of the CSRs by then, some insurers say they would exit or pull back in the marketplaces next year, and others would request large rate increases on exchange plans for 2018.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/key-issue-in-health-care-battle-insurance-subsidies-1501263987", "keywords": ["affordable care act,cost sharing reduction payments,csrs,health exchanges,health insurers,regulation,government policy,government aid,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,health,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid,medicare"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 13:41:00", "news_title": "\u2018Dunkirk\u2019: On Point or Missing the Point?", "content": "In \u201cThe Dumbing Down of \u2018Dunkirk\u2019\u201d (op-ed, July 21) Dorothy Rabinowitz criticizes Director Christopher Nolan for not including Winston Churchill in his film.

There is very little back story to the characters. The dialogue rarely reveals as much as the visuals. It avoids most genre conventions of a war film.Yet for all its restraint, it is still a powerful experience to watch. Why? Mr. Nolan deconstructs the experience of soldiers and civilians and reassembles it in a tense, non linear film about vulnerable people struggling to survive and save lives. He takes the background details as a given. Instead, we get details like fuel gauges, propeller engines, oil leaks and the ever-present bombs.Chandler RydColorado Springs, Colo.In \u201cDunkirk,\u201d the director and script writers have taken one of the most inspiring events of the 20th century and made it mundane, almost to the point of boring. The movie is uneven and disjointed and fails to convey the desperation of the British Empire that made it so important to save as many soldiers as possible to fight another day. It barely mentions the Germans and gives even less attention to Churchill.If you didn\u2019t know history, this movie would have you believe the Royal Air Force and Navy basically abandoned 400,000 soldiers on the beaches of Dunkirk, and that the civilian flotilla showed up at the last minute to save the day.Jim BarberMesa, Ariz.Hopefully, \u201cDunkirk,\u201d with its story of ordinary citizens risking all to save soldiers, will help stir a populace that takes its military for granted.Sam KodaHershey, Pa.The fact that Churchill is missing from \u201cDunkirk\u201d would come as no surprise to anyone aware of what is being taught in most history classes today.While Mr. Nolan is not wrong that the evacuation of Dunkirk owed much to \u201ccommunal heroism,\u201d he is short-sighted to worry that putting \u201cDunkirk\u201d into political context might make the heroism less relevant.Anna Bray DuffClyde Hill, Wash.I was born in southern England at the start of World War II and remember all too well being bombed, as well as how we hung on the words of Churchill coming out of our crackly radio broadcasts to exhort us to keep up our spirits against terrible odds, without sugarcoating or lies.

The company said net income rose 61% to $1.95 billion, or 71 cents a share, from $1.2 billion, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding acquisition-related costs and other items, earnings for the quarter were $1.01 a share, well above the 87-cent-per-share mean estimate among analysts surveyed by FactSet.Second-quarter global sales rose 1% to $9.93 billion, topping Wall Street\u2019s expectation of $9.75 billion.

Prior to the recent court proceedings, Mr. Sharif was considered hard to beat in the election.Mr. Khan pursued Mr. Sharif over the London property so aggressively that, after threatened street protests by his party last year, the Supreme Court took up the case, hearings that snowballed into Friday\u2019s historic verdict.\u201cWe\u2019ve been given hope, because the Supreme Court has stood up and held the powerful accountable,\u201d Mr. Khan said, as he savored the moment at a news conference at his hilltop mansion outside Islamabad. \u201cThis is the beginning.\u201dMr. Sharif denies any wrongdoing.

And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s so puzzling.So with training camps underway, people are still wondering: Will Colin Kaepernick, arguably the game\u2019 s most polarizing active player, find his way onto a roster?The question looked as if it might finally reach a resolution when Ravens coach John Harbaugh mentioned him as a possibility Thursday.\u201cHe\u2019s a guy right now that\u2019s being talked about,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a really good football player.\u201dHarbaugh added that he believes Kaepernick will play this season. But it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to say where, though it is not clear whether that has more to do with football, finances or the firestorm the quarterback generated with his national-anthem protests last year.Kaepernick\u2019s agent didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The Ravens had an obvious need, with Joe Flacco\u2019s status uncertain because of a back injury. It seemed to make perfect sense\u2014the injury, plus Harbaugh\u2019s familiarity with Kaepernick through his brother Jim, the University of Michigan coach who was Kaepernick\u2019s former coach with the 49ers.Then Friday the Ravens signed quarterback       David Olson,        who has no NFL game experience. In college as a backup at Clemson, he threw a career total of three passes for -1 yards.Kaepernick by contrast acquitted himself reasonably well as an NFL starter as recently as last year. On a 49ers team with few bright spots\u2014they went 2-14\u2014Kaepernick threw 16 touchdowns and four interceptions, with a 90.7 passer rating. That rating was 17th in the league, ahead of entrenched starters like Philip Rivers,       Eli Manning       and even Flacco.There\u2019s no consensus explanation for why the Ravens or anybody else hasn\u2019t snatched Kaepernick up. (And, surely, signing Olson doesn\u2019t rule out signing Kaepernick too.)There could be different explanations for different teams. Some may consider him an imperfect backup because his mobile playing style differs significantly enough from their current starter. It could also be financial\u2014Kaepernick played like a quality starter last year, and that might make him cost more than the typical No. 2 quarterback.Then there\u2019s the factor that made Kaepernick a lightning rod a year ago: his national-anthem protests and, more broadly, his outspoken comments on a range of issues, which sparked support and derision in different circles. Kaepernick has said he wouldn\u2019t take a knee this season, according to several media reports, but his case for employment probably wasn\u2019t helped by a survey released by J.D. Power this week that found the protests by Kaepernick and others were a contributing factor for those fans who watched fewer games last season. (The number was relatively small, and roughly equal to the number of fans who stayed away because of domestic-violence arrests involving NFL players.)Now with the first preseason games creeping up on the calendar, time is ticking for Kaepernick to find a landing spot\u2014or for an injury to send a team to his doorstep.Write to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kaepernick-is-nfls-biggest-offseason-puzzle-1501261584", "keywords": ["american football,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 12:49:00", "news_title": "Great Lighthouses of America", "content": "Lighthouses have exchanged their once-crucial role in shipping and American coastal security for a new one as maritime monuments.

It\u2019s easy enough to drape the neckband over your shoulders and leave it there until the end of the day.Although the band itself does add weight, it rests mostly on your collarbone; after a while, you don\u2019t notice it. Most important, that little bit of bulk allows manufacturers to pack in larger batteries that last all day. These are also pretty much the only category of headphone to vibrate when you get an alert on your smartphone (available on all models shown here except the BeatsX).LG\u2019s Tone series of neckband headphones feature earbuds whose wires can be retracted by giving them a tug, like a roll-up shade. If you\u2019re looking for active noise cancellation, the Bose QuietControl 30 ($300) offers that perk, but we found that simply making sure that the earpieces of standard earbuds are seated firmly in your ear canal does a pretty good job of blocking outside noise, too.Here, four models that not only sound great but are sleek and comfortable enough to hang out with all day.This is the outlier of the bunch: Unlike other earbuds shown here, the BeatsX has no bulky neckband to house a large battery, yet it delivers eight hours of playback (and yields two hours of playtime with a five-minute charge). Even better, for owners of an iPhone, iPad or Mac running a newer operating system, the BeatsX eliminates much of the headache associated with Bluetooth pairing. Your first device will automatically sync with the BeatX with just a tap. After that, all of your other Apple devices associated with the same iCloud account get paired in the background. A thicker cable does make these \u2019buds feel heavier than the others, and as with other Beats products, the sound is aggressively bottom-heavy. But for Apple devotees, the convenience makes up for the minor trade offs. $150, beatsbydre.comExpecting pristine sound quality when using earbuds in public is rather misguided, since subtle sonic improvements are easily obliterated by background noise. That said, this pair does sound heavenly, delivering airy, shimmery high and mid frequencies plus plenty of measured and musical-sounding low end. The austere neckband, clad in sheepskin leather with a contrasting red stitch, houses an 1,100 mAh battery that provides 10 hours of playback and can be fully recharged in 90 minutes. A little known feature that will appeal to audiophiles: If the compressed sound of Bluetooth gets you down, you can connect these earbuds to a computer via a micro-USB cable to listen using a purely digital audio path. $200, sennheiser.comIf draping a neckband over your shoulders all day will detract from your meticulously put-together look, fear not. The Forza Metallo Wireless\u2019s lightweight titanium neck band is slim enough to hide under your shirt collar. Sound is open and uncolored, with a crispness that shimmers and bass that never veers toward boomy. It\u2019s also sport-friendly. In addition to being water resistant, it has a nanocoating that protects against sweat\u2019s corrosive properties. Three sizes of earfins, which lock into the folds of your ear to keep the \u2019buds secure, are included. The Forza Metallo has a 10-hour battery life (and a 15-minute quick charge that yields two hours of playback). $170, v-moda.comThe X12\u2019s neckband is the most ornate. Clad in leather with copper-colored caps, it houses not one but two 110-mAh batteries, thus these headphones\u2019 impressive 18 hours of battery life. Although at 3.25 ounces, it\u2019s the heaviest model of those shown here, the X12 is still comfortable to wear. Music comes across as neutral and colored, and a wide range of eartips makes it easy to get a good seal: Three sizes of single-flange tips are included, as well as two sizes of double-flange (for superior noise isolation), and a pair of audiophile-grade expanding foam eartips that are superlative at blocking background noise. The dedicated switch to toggle vibration alerts on and off is a nice touch, too. $399, klipsch.comCorrections & Amplifications   The Klipsch X12 Neckband uses two 110-mAh batteries. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said it uses 1,100-mAh batteries. Also, the article was updated to give a price of $399 for the product.

That has created an opportunity for any investors who can remain calm in the face of its threat.Since its early days as a bookseller, Amazon has demonstrated the ability to siphon the growth out of a variety of businesses and take market share. It has spent billions to do so and plans to continue in that vein as evidenced by its second-quarter earnings report Thursday. So when the e-commerce giant announced plans June 16 to acquire             Whole Foods Market,        WFM -0.14%       shares of leading grocery chain             Kroger        KR 0.93%       fell 9%. Kroger, which already had lowered its guidance for full-year profit ahead of a price war, was now poised to be Amazon\u2019s latest victim\u2014or at least that is what investors feared.But the effect of Amazon\u2019s deal on Kroger\u2019s business won\u2019t be immediate and may ultimately not be as big as feared. Amazon bought Whole Foods because it needed an established business with physical stores to achieve scale in groceries, not because it had already figured out how to dominate that business. Indeed, shares of Kroger have climbed 7% since the Amazon announcement, suggesting the initial selloff was overdone.There have been other prematurely buried Amazon victims. Shares of             Best Buy                   got hit twice, falling more than 6% on July 10 after a report that Amazon was launching a competitor to the chain\u2019s Geek Squad service and about 4% on July 20 after             Sears Holdingssaid it would sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon. Shares of             Home Depot                   and             Lowe\u2019s                   also fell. All three have since regained ground, with Best Buy trading roughly where it was before the first report.Investors may have realized that Amazon\u2019s service\u2014reportedly aimed at helping consumers set up smart-home gadgets, many linked to its Alexa virtual assistant\u2014could have a narrower focus than Best Buy\u2019s. The Geek Squad accounts for only about 3% of Best Buy\u2019s sales, Loop Capital Markets estimates. It estimates major appliances are less than 9% of sales. Moreover, neither Best Buy nor the home-improvement stores have ever sold the Kenmore brand.The Amazon threat shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly, of course. Still, many of the companies that have suffered the most already appeared vulnerable. Even before department stores started selling apparel, they were facing challenges as brands were selling more online and younger shoppers were gravitating toward fast fashion from companies such as             Inditex\u2019s       Zara.There are also survivors of Amazon\u2019s onslaught.             Netflix                   is still adding subscribers, despite Amazon\u2019s push into video streaming. Indeed, if a company has a strong position in its market or won\u2019t be immediately impacted by competition from Amazon, investors should consider buying the dip created by the e-commerce giant\u2019s entrance.The Amazon threat is real, but it isn\u2019t always a sure thing.Write to Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-too-wary-of-the-amazon-effect-1501256617", "keywords": ["competition,deals,investors,threat,victims,Amazon.com,AMZN,Kroger,KR,Whole Foods Market,WFM,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,retail,wholesale,food retailing,supermarkets,grocery stores,specialty stores,etailing,e-commerce,online service providers,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 12:28:00", "news_title": "Republicans Search For Answers; Can They Find Any Across the Aisle?

Amazon founder       Jeff Bezos       bought the Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million.             EBay                   founder       Pierre Omidyar       created First Look Media, which operates the Intercept, and Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes had owned a majority stake in New Republic magazine before selling it last year to Win McCormack.The deal includes the magazine and its website, a live-events business and consulting services but doesn\u2019t include Atlantic Media\u2019s other properties, including National Journal and business news website Quartz.The move cements long-term ownership for the Atlantic, founded in 1857. The news organization had 33 million monthly unique visitors for the first half of this year and now generates annual profits \u201cwell above\u201d $10 million, the Atlantic said in its news release. Total circulation, including print editions and online subscribers, was 505,155 in 2016, compared with 467,693 in 2011, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.Emerson Collective was founded in 2011 as a limited liability corporation and aims to remove barriers to opportunity and promote reform across education, immigration, the environment and other social-justice initiatives.       Mark Zuckerberg       similarly organized his foundation as an LLC to provide more flexibility in making private investments and participating in policy debates.Emerson has invested in a number of media companies\u2014including Axios, the media outlet from Politico co-founder Jim VandeHei, and the production company behind \u201cSpotlight,\u201d the film about the Boston Globe\u2019s role in exposing the child sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church\u2014and gives grants to nonprofit journalism enterprises.Ms. Powell Jobs is buying the stake from owner and chairman,       David Bradley,        founder of the             Advisory Board Co.      , who bought the magazine in 1999.

The framework was to be scrapped under the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed 12-nation trade deal that included the U.S. and Japan. Mr. Trump formally pulled the U.S. out of the TPP before it was submitted to Congress for approval.The tariff increase to 50% from the regular 38.5% will take effect in August and hit frozen beef imports from countries that don\u2019t have an economic partnership agreement with Japan, the Ministry of Finance said. That includes the U.S., Japan\u2019s second-biggest foreign supplier of beef after Australia, as well as Canada and New Zealand.The move doesn\u2019t affect Australia, which has a free-trade deal with Japan, and doesn\u2019t cover refrigerated or fresh beef.The higher beef tariff will likely reduce American beef exports, boost the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, and \u201charm our important bilateral trade relationship with Japan on agricultural products,\u201d U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement.The U.S. Meat Export Federation said Japan\u2019s action would have negative implications for both U.S. beef producers and Japanese restaurant chains that rely on frozen American beef. The group \u201cwill work with its partners in Japan to mitigate the impact\u201d of the move, Chief Executive Philip Seng said.While not entirely unexpected, Tokyo\u2019s move struck a nerve in Washington, where Trump officials have spent months finalizing a small but widely hailed opening for some U.S. beef exports to China.\u2018This wouldn\u2019t happen if TPP was in force.\u2019\u201cThe measure disproportionately falls on U.S. exporters because we don\u2019t have a free-trade agreement with Japan, and this wouldn\u2019t happen if TPP was in force,\u201d said       Jeffrey Schott,        an expert on Washington-Tokyo trade ties at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank that backs trade liberalization. \u201cIt\u2019s a narrowly focused measure, one that\u2019s legal\u201d under the rules of the World Trade Organization, he said.\u201cI am not surprised,\u201d said Darci Vetter, the former chief agricultural trade negotiator in the Obama administration. \u201cIf we had the TPP we would be exempt.\u201dOn Wednesday farm groups converged on Capitol Hill to lament the U.S. withdrawal from the TPP in a hearing before the House agriculture committee. U.S. lawmakers from farm districts favored the Asia-Pacific deal as a way to send more American farm products to Japan, Canada and other signatories.\u201cWe hope the Trump administration and Congress realize that this unfortunate development underscores the urgent need for a bilateral trade agreement with Japan absent the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\u201d said Craig Uden, president of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, in a statement Friday.Trump administration officials say they are seeking to use U.S. leverage the open markets in the Asia-Pacific region through a series of bilateral talks.But some U.S. farm lobbyists worry Tokyo won\u2019t open its agricultural markets significantly through the administration\u2019s bilateral trade and economic talks because Washington has few barriers to Japanese exports that could be lifted in return.Under Japanese law, an additional tariff known as a safeguard is triggered when frozen-beef imports from all countries and frozen-beef imports from countries lacking free-trade deals with Japan\u2014or \u201cnon-EPA countries\u201d\u2014both increase by more than 17% from the same period a year earlier. The import volumes are reviewed each quarter.In the April-June quarter, Japan imported 89,253 tons of frozen beef, 37,823 tons of which came from non-EPA countries. Both numbers surpassed the safeguard volume, the Ministry of Finance said.Frozen beef is widely used at restaurants to make hamburger patties and bowls of beef over rice, a popular fast-food item in Japan. The safeguard duty affects around 12% of Japan\u2019s total beef supply, Finance Ministry tariff official Koyu Izumi said.Recently, frozen beef imports from the U.S. have been on the rise, partly because Japanese importers likely sought to secure the meat before China resumes U.S. beef imports as a part of a trade deal, said Mr. Izumi.Japan is the largest overseas purchaser of U.S. beef, overtaking Canada and Mexico four years ago. In 2016, Japan made up about one-quarter of fresh, frozen and chilled beef exports, according to data compiled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\u2018All this is going to do is cause the Japanese customer to pay more for the beef. As long as they don\u2019t mind paying up for it, it\u2019s not going to be a problem.\u2019The higher tariff comes as wholesale beef prices have gained 3% this year, lifted by booming exports. U.S. cattle ranchers and meatpackers are counting on continued overseas demand as cattlemen expand their herds and dry conditions in some U.S. plains states force more steers and heifers to slaughter.For now, \u201call this is going to do is cause the Japanese customer to pay more for the beef,\u201d said       Tom Leffler,        head of Augusta, Kan.-based Leffler Commodities LLC. \u201cAs long as they don\u2019t mind paying up for it, it\u2019s not going to be a problem.\u201dIn late 2003, Japan banned imports of U.S. beef after the discovery of a case of mad-cow disease. It resumed imports in late 2005, halted them again shortly afterward, then fully restarted them in mid-2006.\u2014Jacob Bunge contributed to this article.Write to Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com and William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-slaps-50-tariff-on-some-u-s-beef-1501224760", "keywords": [" beef, beef imports, donald trump,japan, tariffs, u.s. beef,management,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,economic performance,indicators,trade figures,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,food,beverages,tobacco,animal slaughtering,processing,meat processing,consumer goods,food products"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 12:12:00", "news_title": "The Shark\u2019s Pretty Teeth", "content": "For all the enduring success of their other collaborations,       Bertolt Brecht       and       Kurt Weill       are both best remembered for \u201cDie Dreigroschenoper\u201d (\u201cThe Threepenny Opera\u201d), their caustically witty 1928 adaptation of       John Gay\u2019s       1728 \u201cBeggar\u2019s Opera,\u201d which portrayed low life in 18th-century London. But it was not until 1955 that the American public at large first heard any part of \u201cThe Threepenny Opera\u201d\u2014and it was Louis Armstrong, the most important figure in the history of jazz, who introduced them to it.In September of that year, Armstrong and His All Stars recorded \u201cMack the Knife,\u201d       Marc Blitzstein\u2019s       English-language version of \u201cDie Moritat von Mackie Messer,\u201d a \u201cmurder ballad\u201d about the vicious exploits of the show\u2019s principal character that was the most popular number in \u201cThe Threepenny Opera.\u201d Armstrong\u2019s deliciously swinging cover version became a hit single, one of a handful of small-group jazz recordings ever to do so, and he would perform it the world over until he died in 1971.Armstrong was introduced to \u201cMack the Knife\u201d by       George Avakian,        his producer at Columbia Records. Mr. Avakian, who was determined to put his beloved Satchmo back on the pop charts, had recently seen the 1954 off-Broadway revival of \u201cThe Threepenny Opera.\u201d While the original 1933 Broadway production had closed after just 12 performances, this small-scale staging, newly translated by Blitzstein, the author of \u201cThe Cradle Will Rock,\u201d became a sleeper hit, ultimately running for six years. Mr. Avakian came home certain that \u201cMack the Knife\u201d had the makings of a hit single, but he was unable to persuade any of Columbia\u2019s other artists to play his hunch.       Dave Brubeck,       Erroll Garner       and       Gerry Mulligan       all turned him down flat, finding the simple tune to be too repetitious.It was       Turk Murphy,        a San Francisco trombonist, who suggested that the song might suit Armstrong. Murphy wrote and recorded a combo arrangement that Mr. Avakian brought to the trumpeter, who agreed on the spot to record it. His attraction to \u201cMack the Knife\u201d was easy to understand. Not only was Weill\u2019s riff-like melody instantly appealing, but Blitzstein\u2019s rendering of Brecht\u2019s lyric, an acid-etched portrait of a switchblade-wielding street thug, was no less immediately memorable: \u201cJust a jack-knife has Macheath, dear / And he keeps it out of sight.\u201d Armstrong found the song richly evocative of his New Orleans childhood, laughing out loud as he listened to the demo. \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to love doing this!\u201d he told Mr. Avakian. \u201cI knew cats like this in New Orleans. Every one of them, they\u2019d stick a knife into you without blinking an eye!\u201dMurphy\u2019s arrangement was a spare sketch well suited to the talents of the All Stars, the instrumental combo that accompanied Armstrong. \u201cDig, man, there goes Mack the Knife!\u201d the trumpeter rasped genially by way of introduction.       Arvell Shaw       and Barrett Deems laid down a springy, pulsing two-beat accompaniment on bass and drums over which       Billy Kyle,        the All Stars\u2019 pianist, strewed Basie-like twinkles. A muted Armstrong played the penny-plain melody, with the clarinetist Edmond Hall and the trombonist Trummy Young riffing softly behind him. Then he put down his horn and told the tale of the bloodthirsty Macheath with a glee that had nothing whatsoever to do with the grim lyric, translating it into New Orleans-flavored Satchmo-ese: \u201cOh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear / And he shows them a-poi-ly white.\u201d Armstrong also overdubbed a trumpet obbligato behind his vocal. At the end he pulled out his mute, shouted \u201cTake it, Satch,\u201d and led the band through a rocking out-chorus.The results were irresistible, and no one tried to resist them. Released as fast as Mr. Avakian could slap it onto vinyl, \u201cMack the Knife\u201d rose to No. 20 on Billboard\u2019s pop chart. Though       Bobby Darin\u2019s       cover version, cut three years later, sold even better, it was Armstrong who turned \u201cMack the Knife\u201d into a jazz and pop standard that has since been recorded by such artists as       Tony Bennett,       Ella Fitzgerald,       Bill Haley       and the Comets, Peggy Lee,       Sonny Rollins       and       Frank Sinatra.

Similar patches are planned for 2014-2016 diesel models cited by the EPA and California Air Resources Board, the company said.\u201cThe approvals announced today represent a significant step toward resolving the issues raised by EPA and ARB,\u201d       Sergio Marchionne,        Fiat Chrysler\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.The fate of the 2017 model year diesel vehicles had been in limbo after the EPA earlier this year accused the auto maker of failing to disclose emissions-control software on nearly 104,000 diesel-powered Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicles and Ram pickup trucks in violation of the federal Clean Air Act. In May, the Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler and accused the auto maker of using so-called \u201cdefeat devices.\u201dThe company has denied seeking to intentionally undermine emissions testing and using any illegal devices on its vehicles.EPA officials alerted Fiat Chrysler as early as November 2015 that regulators suspected it of using illegal emissions software. It followed a             Volkswagen AGadmission to using defeat devices to pass government tests and then pollute the air far beyond legal limits.Volkswagen in March pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the U.S. for rigging nearly 600,000 diesel-powered vehicles with illegal software that is on some 11 million vehicles globally.

What sparked the crisis?Millions of documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack & Fonseca Co. were leaked in April last year, and published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Some of the documents showed       Mr. Sharif\u2019s       children as owners, through offshore companies, of expensive apartments in London\u2019s upscale Mayfair area. Mr. Sharif\u2019s political opponents accused him of laundering ill-gotten wealth abroad to buy the properties and demanded he step down and face trial.The Sharif family, which faced scrutiny in the late 1990s and early 2000s too for its wealth, said it own the flats, but said they were acquired from the proceeds of their legitimate businesses. The Panamanian documents related to the Sharifs didn\u2019t allege any wrongdoing, and it is not illegal in Pakistan to own offshore companies.2. How did the case end up in the Supreme Court?Following opposition outrage over the Panama Papers, Mr. Sharif said he would cooperate with any investigation but wouldn\u2019t step down. Former cricket star Imran Khan, his main rival, said the Supreme Court should hear petitions against Mr. Sharif, as it was the only institution free from government influence.The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in November last year after Mr. Khan threatened to march against the government and paralyze the capital, Islamabad.The ruling party said it would cooperate in any investigation, but several\u00a0aides to Mr. Sharif\u00a0labeled the proceedings a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d.3. What did the Supreme Court find against Mr. Sharif?After months of hearings, Mr. Sharif barely escaped ouster in April this year, with two out of five judges on the panel ruling that he should be disqualified. The other three appointed a team of investigators to look into the allegations against the Sharif family. The investigators questioned members of the Sharif family, including the prime minister, in person.Earlier this month, the\u00a0investigation\u00a0team submitted its report, which said the Sharifs\u2019 wealth and lifestyle don\u2019t match their known sources of income, and pointed at discrepancies in the Sharifs\u2019 financial records, including undeclared sources of income. The Sharif family\u2019s lawyers argued that the investigators ignored evidence, and that the family can explain its finances if given a fair trial.4. Why exactly was Mr. Sharif ousted?Court-appointed investigators found that Mr. Sharif became chairman of a United Arab Emirates-based company called Capital FZE in 2007, and was entitled to a salary. While Mr. Sharif\u2019s lawyers argued that it was a ceremonial position and he never drew that salary, the Supreme Court ruled that it was still an asset that he didn\u2019t declare in his nomination papers for the 2013 elections. The court said that because Mr. Sharif failed to disclose this asset, his papers were a \u201cfalse declaration\u201d, which means he\u2019s no longer \u201chonest\u201d. The court also ordered a trial of Mr. Sharif, his children, and finance minister       Ishaq Dar       over allegations of corruption against them.Pakistan\u2019s constitution requires lawmakers to be \u201chonest\u201d and \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d a vague provision inserted under the rule of Islamist military dictator Gen. Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s.5. What is next for Mr. Sharif and Pakistan\u2019s government?The ruling party, Mr. Sharif\u2019s Pakistan Muslim League-N, still has a majority in Pakistan\u2019s parliament, and can elect another prime minister. Khawaja Saad Rafique, the railways minister and a close aide to Mr. Sharif, said after the verdict that the party plans to continue until the next election, due next year.There was speculation\u00a0Friday\u00a0that with Mr. Sharif disqualified from public office, his younger brother Shehbaz is the favorite to succeed him as the party\u2019s next candidate for prime minister. Shehbaz Sharif is currently the chief minister of Punjab, Pakistan\u2019s richest and most populous province and a stronghold of the ruling party. Mr. Sharif\u2019s aides didn\u2019t comment on specific candidates, but said an announcement will be made in the next few days.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-things-to-know-about-the-ousting-of-pakistan-prime-minister-sharif-1501257769", "keywords": ["narwaz sharif ouster,narwaz sharif removal,pakistan prime minister ousted,pakistan ruling family,panama papers,sharif corruption,sharif family holdings,International Consortium of Investigative Journalists,Mr. Sharif,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 12:00:00", "news_title": "At Boston\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts, Rival Woodcut Artists Face Off", "content": "Japanese woodcut artists Utagawa Kuniyoshi and Utagawa Kunisada were fierce rivals in the 19th century. Nearly 200 years later, they\u2019re competing again.A new exhibition starting Aug. 11 features 100 of the artists\u2019 colorful images of Kabuki theater actors, beautiful women, dueling warriors and battles between heroes and monsters. \u201cShowdown! Kuniyoshi vs. Kunisada\u201d will give visitors at Boston\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts the chance to decide\u2014on an iPad in the gallery or online\u2014which artist they prefer. Organized thematically by subject, the prints of each artist sport a different colored frame\u2014black for Kuniyoshi (1797-1861) and cherry wood for Kunisada (1786-1864).In the 19th century, both artists made their living in large part by illustrating fashionably dressed people and, especially, Kabuki theater actors. Kabuki was a rich dance-drama tradition then already several centuries old. Plot-heavy and stylized, with an emphasis on vivid costumes and makeup, it was the main form of entertainment, especially in big cities. \u201cIf you wanted a picture of your favorite star, you bought a color woodblock print,\u201d says exhibition curator       Sarah Thompson.Each woodblock artist created thousands of designs. Fans could buy a print in a bookstore for the price of a bowl of noodles. The artists\u2019 prints of celebrities were like today\u2019s glossy magazine covers.Both Kuniyoshi and Kunisada, who was 11 years older, came from Edo, the city that is now Tokyo. In contrast to Kunisada, whose family owned a successful ferry service, Kuniyoshi came from a modest background. His father is thought to have been a textile dyer, leading some scholars to connect his father\u2019s profession with the bright colors that he used in his works.The two artists apprenticed with the same teacher, Utagawa Toyokuni, who headed the top school of the time for woodblock artists. (The first part of their names, \u201cKuni,\u201d comes from Toyokuni.) His specialty was teaching how to draw the faces of actors so that they would be recognizable. \u201cThe business they were in was very commercial and competitive,\u201d Dr. Thompson says.Kuniyoshi and Kunisada often competed for the same kinds of commissions from publishers. Dr. Thompson says that one story\u2014possibly apocryphal\u2014holds that when Kuniyoshi was a struggling young artist, he saw the older Kunisada passing by on a boat surrounded by gorgeous women. The vision motivated Kuniyoshi to work harder.In their lifetimes, Kunisada was the favorite. He rendered actors more realistically than Kuniyoshi did, says Dr. Thompson, so the actors\u2019 fans preferred the older man\u2019s works. In his woodcut design \u201cActor Onoe Kikugor\u00f4 III as a Cat Monster,\u201d Kunisada depicts an angry man-beast with a fearsome expression and a sumptuous kimono. Three actors have a lively conversation in Kunisada\u2019s triptych \u201cPlum: Actors Arashi Kichisabur\u00f4 III, Ichikawa Kodanji IV, and Iwai Kumesabur\u00f4 III, from the series \u2018A Modern Shuihuzhuan.\u2019\u201d Cherry-tree blossoms and branches stretch across all three images of the actors, each wearing clothing with different animal motifs.With the advent of photography, such artistic realism lost much of its value. Today, collectors tend to prefer Kuniyoshi\u2019s works, depicting hard-charging heroes and frightening monsters, Dr. Thompson says. Kuniyoshi tended to fill his whole image with movement, such as his circa 1851-1852 triptych, \u201cThe Rescue of Tametomo,\u201d in which ghostly bird-men, amid raging waves, save the hero from a giant fish with a gaping mouth full of teeth. In Kuniyoshi\u2019s 1830 \u201cHayakawa Ayunosuke,\u201d the hero blocks a massive wave with part of a wooden wall as fish leap in the white foam on top of it.In the 1840s, a brief government crackdown set back both artists\u2014at least at the start. Declaring that \u201cto make woodblock prints of Kabuki actors, courtesans and geisha is detrimental to public morals,\u201d political leaders banned extravagant images. New designs were supposed to reflect \u201cloyalty and filial piety.\u201dEventually, though, says Dr. Thompson, the decree provoked the artists into more creativity\u2014especially Kuniyoshi. He started designing \u201ccomplicated pictures that looked as though they had hidden meaning,\u201d she says. In 1843, for example, he designed a battle between monsters that many people thought represented citizens angry about the new laws. \u201cHe escaped punishment because there was no proof of deliberate wrongdoing,\u201d says Dr. Thompson.Today, Kuniyoshi\u2019s prints bring in anywhere from a few hundred dollars for a simple print to five figures for an elaborate triptych. Scholars see his imaginative storytelling and fantastical subject matter as an influence on today\u2019s anime, or Japanese animation. Contemporary manga comic-book artists use the same imagery of ghosts, monsters and giant skeletons that Kuniyoshi and Kunisada did, Dr. Thompson says.She adds with a laugh: \u201cThere are still a lot of people having fun with monsters.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-bostons-museum-of-fine-arts-rival-woodcut-artists-face-off-1501257614", "keywords": [" art, boston tourism, boston travel, galleries, kunisada,kuniyoshi, museum of fine arts, museums, showdown,Sarah Thompson,art,political,general news,celebrities,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,calendar of events,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 11:52:00", "news_title": "Will We Soon See Singing, Acting Politicians?", "content": "For the stars of stage and screen, the dream of another audience\u2014the one in the voting booth\u2014lives on. Celebrities as varied as Dwayne Johnson (The Rock), Kid Rock and Caitlyn Jenner have been making noises recently about running for public office.If tweets are to be believed, the Michigan-born rocker Kid Rock might challenge Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow for her seat in 2018. Meanwhile, wrestler-turned-matinee-idol Mr. Johnson told GQ that he could imagine himself in the White House one day. And onetime Olympic star and transgender heroine Ms. Jenner has been talking about running for the U.S. Senate out in California.As a Republican, no less.If anything comes of all this, the three would be following in the footsteps of such resounding successes as Ronald Reagan (actor), Al Franken (comic) and Donald Trump (television host, real-estate developer, impresario). They would also be following the trails blazed by the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jesse Ventura and Sonny Bono.The chutzpah that pop-culture icons display when they talk about manning the hustings must be maddening to politicians, who man the hustings for a living. Politicians are committed professionals with real talents. They\u2019re not amateurs or clowns. And they did not enter politics as a stunt, to see if anyone would bother listening to them (well, perhaps some of them did).So the obvious question is: How would the Messrs. Rock and Ms. Jenner like it if politicians responded to any incursion on their turf by suddenly waltzing into the performers\u2019 chosen fields?The results would not be pretty. Can we imagine House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Sen. Susan Collins hatching conspiracies as leading ladies in \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d? Can we envision a scenario in which the preternaturally uncool Gov. Chris Christie fills in for Keanu Reeves in \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 3\u201d? Would we sign off on Sen. Chuck Schumer taking over for Flea in the Red Hot Chili Peppers? Or Congressman Steny Hoyer hitting the arena circuit in place of Eminem?Does anyone want to see Sen. Paul Ryan thundering across the stage like Angus Young of AC/DC? Sen. Elizabeth Warren decked out like Beyonc\u00e9? Attorney General Jeff Sessions playing a fearsome hit man in \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d? Newt Gingrich recording the Patti Smith songbook?Because the truth is, such obviously implausible role reversals are tantamount to Kid Rock and The Rock deciding that what the U.S. Senate really needs is their own bombastic, opinionated presence. (Then again, considering the antics of that august body lately, maybe no one would notice.)Are there figures in the rich, varied world of American politics who could handles such career shifts with aplomb? Sure. Sen. Bernie Sanders has the wise, well-traveled look needed to replace Ian McKellen as Gandalf in any future \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d remake. And many who saw \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d would agree that a tough-talking chrome dome like Gov. Jerry Brown would be a vast improvement over the cartoonish The Rock, whose only virtue in the latest installment of that crash-and-noise fest is to make The Vin Diesel seem like The Laurence Olivier as Hamlet.That said, the very notion of having both a Sen. Rock and a President The Rock is tempting.

Lately, however, the strategy has run into an obstacle few people saw coming: a legion of foodies who think skinny pigs make for dry, bland meat.The growing clamor for greasy bacon, sausages stuffed with supple lard, and pork chops oozing with deep, scrumptious, oleaginous flab is so strong, in fact, that a problem has developed. America has a shortage of flabby pigs.After deciding to search for a new local source of pork chops in December, Mr. Foster had to patiently woo an upstate New York farmer just to get his hooks on a single portly Ossabaw Island hog. \u201cHe sent us a pig. Then two pigs,\u201d Mr. Foster says of the courtship. \u201cIt was \u2018Let\u2019s feel this out.\u2019\u00a0\u201dFinally, in May, the farmer agreed Mr. Foster was worthy of the four a week he wanted. The regular supply \u201chas been a huge, huge weight off my mind,\u201d he says.\u201cPeople are taking a good hard look at their pork chops,\u201d says farmer       Mike Yezzi,        49, whose Flying Pigs Farm supplies Mr. Foster, \u201cand realizing there\u2019s no way to cook this pork chop and not wind up without it being tough.\u201dMore back fat is what discriminating pork lovers want, inches of it, along with redder meat. And thick, greasy bacon, and more supple lard in sausages. That\u2019s the attraction of meat from fatty \u201cheritage\u201d breeds that can be hard to come by.Penn TenEyck, a restaurant owner in tony Dataw Island, S.C., two years ago wanted to add pork chops to his menu but says \u201c99% of the time they are dry.\u201dHe found the breed of his desire\u2014huge Tamworth hogs\u2014at a farm an hour from Charleston. But \u201cthey had more chefs than hogs,\u201d says Mr. TenEyck, 33. \u201cTo get in the doors was a little bit of a struggle.\u201dHe persuaded another chef to put in a good word with the farmer,       Marc Filion.       Then he kept showing up at the local farmers market to chat up the farmer. After six months of Mr. TenEyck\u2019s wooing, Mr. Filion agreed to sell him a pig.Mr. TenEyck\u2019s restaurant now trims the fat before serving $25 pork chops, using the lard in chicken p\u00e2t\u00e9. \u201cYou get that nuttiness, that creamy flavor,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fat cap on these things is like an inch and a half.\u201dMr. Filion, 61, began raising Tamworths\u2014nicknamed \u201cbacon pigs\u201d\u2014at the urging of a local chef. \u201cWhat really surprised me was when we started getting calls from chefs that were not in Charleston,\u201d he says. \u201cThese chefs were in Columbia, Atlanta, Charlotte.\u201dFor millennia, farmers bred pigs to be fat, prized partly for the lard used for meals and lubricants. Then synthetic oils and competition from leaner meats had many American hog farmers avoiding the fattiest breeds.By 2000, the number of stubby-legged Berkshire pigs registered in the National Swine Registry had dramatically declined. Some lardier hogs have gone extinct, says the Livestock Conservancy, a nonprofit that aims to conserve endangered farm-animal breeds.The pork industry created a better-quality meat by breeding leaner hogs, says       Steve Meyer,        an economist who analyzes pork markets at Express Markets Inc., a Fort Wayne, Ind., research firm.With the rise of low-carb high-protein diets, fatty bacon made a comeback. Elite chefs began to cook with oilier pork chops and sausages.Fattier cuts are now consistently pricing above leaner cuts. Pork bellies, used to make bacon, are so popular their prices have risen around 80% this year.Among breeds making a comeback are the compact-sized guinea hog, known for its generous back fat. In 1990, conservationists located just 50 guineas in the U.S., says the Livestock Conservancy. Over 3,000 have been registered since 2007.\u201cChefs started to discover that you could make some really good charcuterie with these little pigs,\u201d says       Jeannette Beranger,        the conservancy\u2019s senior program manager.Cathy Payne,        64, had never raised pigs when she decided to raise guinea hogs on her Elberton, Ga., farm. After months of research in 2013, she found a few in Mississippi and brought them back in two crates in her Toyota Prius.Her pigs are now so sought-after she put an electric gate on her driveway to keep out would-be rustlers. She interviews prospective owners to make sure they are committed to proliferating the breed, saying: \u201cI\u2019m selective about who keeps them.\u201dIn Fort Collins, Colo.,       Harvey Blackburn,        coordinator for the U.S. Agriculture Department\u2019s National Animal Germplasm Program, oversees a facility preserving the frozen semen, embryos, oocytes and ovaries of 1,500 different pigs. He says the expansion of farmers markets is creating a fatty-hog-semen revival.One farmer, 48-year-old Gra\u2019 Moore of Carolina Heritage Farms in South Carolina\u2014\u201cThe Hogfather\u201d to chefs\u2014is working with USDA sperm to bring back the fatty American Spot pig. \u201cThe pork chops at the grocery store,\u201d he says, \u201ctaste like cardboard.\u201dThe rare floppy-eared Large Black and the outdoor-foraging Gloucestershire Old Spots are so desired in America that in 2015 a U.S. group imported semen from the U.K., says Professor and State Swine Breeding Specialist       Tim Safranski       at University of Missouri-Columbia, who helped with the project.The revival has inspired what hog experts call \u201cbad actors,\u201d breeders who pass off skinny pigs as fattier types by crossing lardy and lean breeds. \u201cPeople will take a pig you can basically find on Craigslist, cross it with a guinea hog and most people can\u2019t tell the difference,\u201d says Mr. Safranski.Big companies are bellying up, including Perdue Farms Inc., whose Niman Ranch unit advertises heritage hogs. Niman expects its farmers to produce hogs with twice the fat of typical commercially grown pigs, says Niman general manager       Jeff Tripician.\u201cCardiac doctors were against eating pork\u2026So the pork industry responded to that by genetically beginning to produce leaner hogs,\u201d says       Bob Darrell,        vice president of retail fresh-pork sales for Smithfield Foods Inc., a major U.S. pork producer that says it has been breeding fatter commercial pigs over the past decade.\u201cNow we\u2019ve done a U-turn.

The bad news is that life is full of suffering and we humans are full of illusions. The good news is that these two problems are actually one problem: If we could get rid of our illusions\u2014if we could see the world clearly\u2014our suffering would end.And there\u2019s more good news: Buddhism offers tools for doing that job. A good example is the type of meditation known as mindfulness meditation, now practiced by millions of people in the U.S. and other places far from Buddhism\u2019s Asian homeland. Mindfulness meditation, Buddhists say, can change our perspective on feelings such as anxiety and rage and thereby sap their power to warp our vision and make us suffer.These claims\u2014the bad news and the good\u2014are more than two millennia old, but they\u2019re now getting important support from evolutionary psychology, the modern study of how natural selection engineered the human mind. Evolutionary psychology gives Buddhism\u2019s diagnosis of the human predicament a back story. It explains why humans are prone to illusions and to suffering and why the two problems are related. And this explanation can strengthen the Buddhist prescription, adding to the power of mindfulness meditation in particular.Mindfulness meditation is an exercise in attention. It involves calming the mind\u2014typically by focusing on the breath\u2014and then using the resulting equanimity to observe things with unusual care and clarity. The things observed can include sounds, physical sensations or anything else in the field of awareness. But perhaps most important is the careful observation of feelings, because feelings play such a powerful role in guiding our perceptions, thoughts and behavior.And here is where an evolutionary perspective can be helpful. Mindfulness calls for a kind of skepticism toward feelings. Rather than automatically following their guidance, you critically inspect them and decide which ones to trust. Evolutionary psychology helps to explain why this skepticism is warranted\u2014why so many human feelings are unreliable guides. We don\u2019t generally think of Darwin and the Buddha as being on the same wavelength, but in this and other ways their worldviews turn out to harmonize nicely.The Darwinian account of the human situation, like the Buddhist account, begins with bad news. The process that created us, natural selection, is indifferent to whether we are happy or sad, enlightened or deluded. Ultimately, natural selection only cares about one thing (or, I should say, \u201ccares\u201d\u2014in quotes\u2014since natural selection is just a blind process, not a conscious designer). And that one thing is getting genes into the next generation. Genetically based mental traits\u2014including particular feelings\u2014that in the past contributed to genetic proliferation have flourished, while traits that didn\u2019t have fallen by the wayside. Whether those feelings\u2014and the thoughts and perceptions those feelings shape\u2014give us a true view of reality is, strictly speaking, beside the point. So is whether they make us happy or miserable.Take anxiety, for example. Evolutionary psychologists consider anxiety to be natural, grounded in our genes. After all, worrying about things can lead you to do something about those things. If you worry that your toddler, who seems to have wandered off somewhere, may get devoured by a beast, you\u2019ll go make sure your toddler is safe\u2014which, not incidentally, means making sure that copies of your genes are safe.\u2018Anxiety is unpleasant. But natural selection doesn\u2019t care about that.\u2019Of course, anxiety is unpleasant. But natural selection doesn\u2019t care about that. It doesn\u2019t even care that some of this unpleasantness will be for naught\u2014that your toddler turned out to be in the hut next door, and the nightmare scenario that for a moment seemed so real was all in your head. Better safe than sorry, from natural selection\u2019s point of view. \u201cFalse positives\u201d are a feature, not a bug, even though they make you suffer by fostering an illusion.According to evolutionary psychology, our natural anxieties include social anxieties. The ancestral environment\u2014the hunter-gatherer milieu in which humans evolved\u2014featured lots of social interaction, and this interaction had consequence for a person\u2019s genes. If you had low status in the group and few friends, that cut your chances of spreading your genes, so impressing people mattered.Similarly, if your offspring didn\u2019t thrive socially, that boded ill for their reproductive prospects, and hence for your genes. So it made sense, in Darwinian terms, for our ancestors to worry about what people thought of them and their offspring.Here, too, false positives could arise. Our ancestors presumably worried about some things in their social environment that turned out not to be worth worrying about. But we moderns have things even worse. The false-positive problem can be compounded by the fact that anxiety no longer operates in the environment for which natural selection designed it.Consider an artifact that has never been found by archaeologists unearthing the remnants of a Paleolithic hunter-gatherer village: PowerPoint. One thing our hunter-gatherer ancestors didn\u2019t do was give presentations to an audience consisting largely of people they didn\u2019t know. Maybe that\u2019s why the prospect of doing this fills some people with overwhelming anxiety: Anxieties designed for a small and fairly intimate social environment get amplified by an environment that is neither.This doesn\u2019t mean that anxiety about public speaking is worthless. Worrying about your PowerPoint presentation can lead to a better presentation.But let\u2019s face it: Though this anxiety is sometimes productive, it often isn\u2019t. There are people who, before a presentation, are beset by images of themselves spontaneously vomiting while talking to a crowd\u2014even though, come to think of it, they\u2019ve never spontaneously vomited while talking to a crowd. In a particularly perverse twist on PowerPoint anxiety, I\u2019ve been known to lie awake the night before a big presentation worrying that if I don\u2019t get to sleep I\u2019ll do a bad job the next day.I defy anyone to argue that this is natural selection\u2019s way of increasing my chances of surviving and reproducing. So too with other modern social anxieties: a sense of dread before going to a cocktail party that, in fact, is unlikely to lead to anything worth dreading; or worrying about how your child is doing at her first slumber party, something you\u2019re powerless to influence. Our hunter-gatherer ancestors didn\u2019t have to navigate roomfuls of people they had never met, or send their children off to sleep in homes they had never seen\u2014and that, presumably, is why these occasions can bring powerful yet typically unproductive anxiety.\u2018Our hunter-gatherer ancestors didn\u2019t have to navigate roomfuls of people they had never met.\u2019This mismatch between our evolved nature and the environment in which we find ourselves isn\u2019t just a modern phenomenon. For thousands of years, there have been social environments that weren\u2019t the ones people were designed for. The Buddha was born to a royal family, which means that he lived in a society with clusters of population much bigger than a hunter-gatherer village. And there is evidence that people were being called on to speak before large audiences and that something like PowerPoint anxiety had taken shape. In one discourse, the Buddha\u2019s list of common fears included the \u201cfear of embarrassment in assemblies.\u201dThat people were, even in the Buddha\u2019s day, experiencing an uncomfortable mismatch between the environment their feelings were engineered for and the environment in which they found themselves may help to explain Buddhism\u2019s early emphasis on meditative practice. The meditation that is described in ancient texts would have made people more aware of their feelings\u2014in a sense more objectively aware of them\u2014and so less reflexively governed by them. This remains a central goal of mindfulness meditation today.And it can work. I have a daily meditation practice\u2014periodically recharged by silent meditation retreats of a week or more\u2014and I have more than once used meditation to deal with intense anxiety. In the middle of the night before a big talk, I have even sat up in bed, meditated, and gotten to a point where I viewed a knot of anxiety with such calm objectivity that it might as well have been a piece of abstract art I was contemplating in a museum. It entirely lost its grip on me, after which it disappeared. Perhaps Buddhists more than two millennia ago had much the same experience when meditating on \u201cfear of speaking in assemblies.\u201dThere is no doubt, however, that the modern environment surpasses the Buddha\u2019s environment in its power to warp our feelings about, hence our perception of, the world. Consider powdered sugar doughnuts.I have warm feelings toward them\u2014so warm that, if I were guided only by my feelings, I would eat them for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and between-meal snacks. Yet I\u2019m told that eating that many doughnuts would be bad for me\u2014that my feeling of attraction to powdered-sugar doughnuts is not to be trusted. This is hard news to take.How could natural selection let something like this happen\u2014give me feelings that don\u2019t even do a good job of taking care of the body containing my genes? Well, natural selection designed our feelings for an environment with no junk food, an environment in which the sweetest thing available was fruit. So a sweet tooth, and the feelings it inspires, served us well. But in the modern world, which features the achievement of culinary science known as \u201cempty calories,\u201d these feelings become misleading.Or, I should say, more misleading. Fundamental to Buddhism is the idea that craving in general\u2014tanha, as it\u2019s called in ancient texts\u2014is inherently misleading. Regardless of what we thirst after\u2014junk food, healthful food, sex\u2014the thirst, the tanha, fosters an illusion of enduring gratification. When I see anything tasty, I imagine how good it will taste, not how that satisfaction will inevitably fade, leading to the desire for more.\u2018The pleasures we seek evaporate quickly and leave us thirsting for more.\u2019This was one of the Buddha\u2019s main messages: that the pleasures we seek evaporate quickly and leave us thirsting for more. We spend our time looking for the next gratifying thing\u2014the next doughnut, the next sexual encounter, the next status-enhancing promotion, the next online purchase. But the thrill always fades, and it always leaves us wanting more. The old Rolling Stones lyric \u201cI can\u2019t get no satisfaction\u201d is, according to Buddhism, the human condition. Though the Buddha is famous for asserting that life is full of suffering, some scholars say that\u2019s an incomplete rendering of his message and that the word translated as \u201csuffering,\u201d dukkha, could be translated as \u201cunsatisfactoriness.\u201dFrom natural selection\u2019s point of view, dooming an animal to relentlessly recurring unsatisfactoriness is a wonderful idea. After all, if pleasure didn\u2019t subside, we\u2019d never seek it again. Our first meal would be our last, because hunger would never return. So too with sex: a single act of intercourse, and then a lifetime of lying there basking in the afterglow. That\u2019s no way to get lots of genes into the next generation! Contentment is nice while it lasts, but it evaporates by design.Much in the modern world\u2014from junk food to pornography to nicotine to the             Facebook                   algorithm that governs your news feed\u2014has been engineered to intensify tanha, our unquenchable desire for more.What to do? One approach is to meditate: Observe particular cravings mindfully, thus weakening them. This is challenging\u2014more challenging than meditating on anxiety, I\u2019d say\u2014but there\u2019s evidence that it can work. A study involving 88 smokers, published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence in 2011, found that this kind of mindfulness training more effectively treated nicotine addiction than the American Lung Association\u2019s Freedom From Smoking program, which offers group counseling and a menu of therapies such as nicotine patches.\u2018Regular mindfulness meditation can also undermine craving in a more general way.\u2019Regular mindfulness meditation can also undermine craving in a more general way. It can lessen the urgency of finding the next big thing by deepening your appreciation of things that you already have.Buddhism\u2019s list of unfortunate human illusions is long. It includes misconceptions about the \u201cself\u201d that we think of as being at our core and misconceptions about the nature of the things that we see in the world, including other humans. And many of these illusions can plausibly be explained as having been implanted in us by natural selection to serve its agenda\u2014an agenda that doesn\u2019t put a priority on seeing the world as it actually is or on finding lasting happiness in the world that we do see.It is a tribute to Buddhism that it sized up the human predicament more than two millennia before science got around to discovering the origins of that predicament. But it would be unlike the Buddha to boast about this. If he were around today, he might instead thank Darwin for the corroboration, for explaining how humans wound up being prone to illusion and to attendant suffering. And if Darwin were around today, and joined the mindfulness meditation movement, he might thank the Buddha for coming up with a way to address the problem.This essay is adapted from Mr. Wright\u2019s new book, \u201cWhy Buddhism Is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment,\u201d which will be published by Simon & Schuster on Aug. 8.

With the rebound in growth owing more to temporary factors and measurement issues than anything fundamental, the average of the two figures of 1.9% is probably the better reflection of GDP\u2019s underlying trend.It is a trend investors have gotten used to. Since the recession ended, GDP has grown at a 2.1% annual rate. Everybody would have liked, and many people expected, growth to be stronger. Then again, the economy weathered a lot, including Europe\u2019s crisis, the 2011 debt-ceiling imbroglio and last year\u2019s global credit strains, during those years. Sometimes being stuck in a rut isn\u2019t such a bad thing.Moreover, slow as growth has been, it has been sufficient for the economy to keep adding jobs. Even though wage growth has been lackluster, the pace of hiring has bolstered household income, helping to repair some of the damage inflicted by the financial crisis while supporting steady growth in consumer spending. Next Friday\u2019s jobs report will likely show that hiring remains strong.Half of the message for investors is that they shouldn\u2019t expect the economy to suddenly shift into higher gear, particularly with the stimulus hopes that accompanied President       Donald Trump\u2019s       move to the White House looking increasingly doubtful. But the other half of the message is that the economy can absorb a lot, and despite all the political uncertainties the U.S. faces, the risk of recession\u2014typically the stock market\u2019s biggest danger\u2014remains low.

Cannondale-Drapac also announced late in the Tour it had picked up a significant new sponsor\u2014the digital media company Oath, which is part of Verizon and oversees brands such as AOL, TechCrunch and HuffPost. Jason Gay spoke to Oath CEO       Tim Armstrong       about the sponsorship deal.Why sponsor a cycling team?Oath, as a part of Verizon, is very [invested] in sports overall and we have a growing global presence. The Tour is the largest-watched annual sporting event, behind only the Olympics and World Cup. And in the tech community, in the customer community we serve, and in the countries that we\u2019re in, the Tour is a very global, high-reaching opportunity for us at a high scale, a high frequency in terms of hitting the target audiences we want to talk to.And the second thing is we really want content. We want to be the company that brings inside content from the world\u2019s most exciting sporting events, like the Tour, directly to our consumers. So it\u2019s a combination of the right global audience and right global insider content. It\u2019s exciting.Let\u2019s talk a bit more about the content part of it, because it seems that cycling, like every sport, is looking at new ways to get content to fans.You know, fan is short for \u201cfanatic.\u201d Fans want a fanatically deep experience in sports and they want to have direct relationships with the people they care about the most. And one interesting thing in terms of our sports coverage overall is we\u2019re starting to go to the fanatical level. I think the Tour de France is a great example. If you\u2019re a fanatical fan of biking, you want to get directly to the team, you want to get directly with the riders and directly with the strategy. And this deal is going to allow us to put the fans on the bikes.Are you much of a cycling fan?You know, I\u2019ve watched the Tour de France, I have two Cannondale bikes, I do triathlons. And then I\u2019ve been really interested in how the Tour coverage has changed over time. It\u2019s exploded in terms of television, obviously, but there\u2019s other amazing things happening now, with podcasts around the sport, and so I\u2019ve been paying attention to that as well. Even at this year\u2019s Tour, things like       Lance Armstrong\u2019s       pod, which was an insider\u2019s view, I think media\u2019s kind of changing around the tour quickly.Whenever anybody gets involved with a cycling team, invariably the question of doping comes up and the history of drug scandals in the sport. That\u2019s obviously a concern for anybody with a financial interest in cycling. How much of a caution was that for you?Yeah, our case is really about serving our fans. It\u2019s been very highly publicized what\u2019s happened in the sport, and the clean up of the sport. I think from our standpoint, we want to super-serve our fans and we\u2019re trusting the sport is going to continue to be cleaned up over time. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019re concerned about, and we\u2019re starting this as an experiment to see how it goes. We\u2019re starting with our fans and working backwards from that. The fans love the Tour. My guess is they\u2019ll keep their fans as long as they keep it a clean sport, and we\u2019re relying on them to move in that direction.Do you get to have a say in the team uniform [kit] for next year?I stick to my bike lane\u2014and we have some of the world\u2019s best marketing people here, [like Oath] CMO Allie Kline. I think the only place we want to put our logo is where it\u2019s going to help the team win. We\u2019ll rely on the team to make sure they do what\u2019s best for them, and we\u2019ll all win together.Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-cyclings-new-oath-1501255052", "keywords": ["Verizon Communications,VZ,Tim Armstrong,cycling,sports,commentaries,opinions,routine general news,media,entertainment"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 11:17:00", "news_title": "Germany Confronts the Forgotten Story of Its Other Genocide", "content": "SHARK ISLAND, Namibia\u2014Just over a century ago, Germany built one of its first concentration camps on a narrow peninsula jutting into the Atlantic.A 1904 uprising in what was then called German South-West Africa turned into a war of annihilation against the Herero and Nama peoples. At least 60,000 are believed to have died, including some 2,000 in the Shark Island camp, where inmates were starved, beaten and worked to death.That episode of colonial brutality, considered by many historians to be the first genocide of the 20th century, is now testing the limits of historical apologies.Namibia says it wants Germany to officially recognize that its actions constituted genocide, to issue a formal apology and to pay reparations. Berlin says it is willing to meet the first two demands and to pay some form of compensation. The two countries have been negotiating for more than a year.Other governments have expressed regret or sorrow for past atrocities. What makes the current situation novel is that most have stopped short of any official apology, and financial payments have been rare.The talks \u201care being watched very closely by other countries,\u201d says Germany\u2019s ambassador to Namibia, Christian Schlaga.Debate has surged in recent years about whether and how nations should take responsibility and make amends for horrors inflicted generations ago.Belgium apologized for its role in the 1961 assassination of Congo\u2019s first post-independence prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, but not for its colonial abuses in that country. In 2006, then-U.K. Prime Minister       Tony Blair       expressed \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d for Britain\u2019s role in the slave trade, but didn\u2019t apologize.Former French President       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande       recognized the suffering of Algerians under France\u2019s \u201cbrutal and unfair\u201d colonial rule, but again there was no official apology. Last year, U.S. President       Barack Obama       paid homage to the victims of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, but didn\u2019t apologize.Japan has come the closest to what Germany is trying to do now. In 2015, it settled a long-running dispute with South Korea by agreeing to pay about $9 million in support funds for surviving Korean \u201ccomfort women\u201d used as sex slaves by the Japanese military in the 1930s and 1940s. Japanese Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe       extended an apology.The question has exquisite historical resonance for Germany in particular. Countless museums and memorials throughout the country act as reminders of Germany\u2019s genocidal slaughter during World War II. Because most Germans accept their history has dark chapters, and are proud of how they have been handled, they might find it easier to face colonial atrocities than citizens of other European powers, says J\u00fcrgen Zimmerer, professor of global history at the University of Hamburg and president of the International Network of Genocide Scholars.Following World War II, Germany acknowledged its responsibility for the Holocaust and agreed to pay damages to survivors, but not to the families of those who were killed.A successful conclusion to the negotiations between Germany and Namibia \u201cwould be a signal, and an invitation, to other former colonial powers to deal with their past,\u201d says Medardus Brehl, a historian at the Institute for Diaspora and Genocide Studies at the \u200bRuhr-University Bochum in Germany.At the same time, \u200ba growing number of Germans are beginning to bristle at constantly carrying their historical guilt. Right-wing parties have recently called for the country to move beyond its past and develop a new sense of patriotism.Complicating the talks are a multitude of constituencies with their own agendas. In addition to the two governments, there are tribal chiefs angry about being excluded from the talks, German-Namibians nervous about their standing in modern-day Namibia and citizens in both countries who want to leave the past in the past.David Frederick       is an 84-year-old local Nama chief who lives in Bethanie, a small desert town three hours by car from Shark Island. In a recent interview, he said German negotiators\u00a0should visit his home so they could hear about the genocide from members of his family and the community\u201cThey must hear it straight from someone who was affected,\u201d said Mr. Frederick. \u201cThe Nama people, from generation to generation, told the story, and that is the story they need to hear.\u201dAbout a year and a half into the talks between the two governments, the chief said he and his people feel sidelined.In January, Mr. Frederick joined a class-action lawsuit against Germany filed on behalf of the Herero and Nama peoples in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. (The Alien Tort Claims Act allows foreigners to seek remedies in U.S. courts for human-rights violations outside of the U.S.) They are seeking unspecified reparations, arguing their exclusion from the negotiations between the two governments \u201cis yet another \u2018taking\u2019 or attempt to strip [them] of their property rights.\u201dGerman officials declined to comment on the suit, and the Namibian government says it is committed to the negotiations with Germany. A previous attempt by members of the Herero community to seek reparations from Germany in a U.S. court failed.Germany\u2019s effort to put down the Herero and Nama uprisings, sparked by expropriation of land and cattle, was waged by soldiers using artillery and machine guns against the rifles, clubs and knives of tribal warriors. Within five years,\u00a0an estimated 80% of the Herero and 50% of the Nama, herdsmen who populated much of central and southern Namibia, were dead or had fled the country.A disastrous Herero defeat at the Waterberg, a mountainous plateau on the edge of the Kalahari, pushed tens of thousands of men, women and children deep into the desert. On Oct. 4, 1904, German Gen. Lothar von Trotha declared: \u201cThe people of the Herero have to leave the country\u2026Within German borders, every Herero, with or without a rifle, with or without cattle, will be shot.\u201d Six months later, a similar order was issued for the Nama.Those who survived and didn\u2019t escape into modern-day Botswana were herded into concentration camps, of which Shark Island, off the colonial town of L\u00fcderitz, was the most notorious.angolanamibiaWindhoekAtlanticOceanbotswanaBethanieSHARKISLAND100 miles", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-confronts-the-forgotten-story-of-its-other-genocide-1501255028", "keywords": ["german concentration camps,german reparations,germany,herero,holocaust,kenya,nama,namibia,shark island,tanzania,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,risk news,military action,war crimes"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 11:10:00", "news_title": "U.S. Consumer Sentiment Fell in July", "content": "American consumers\u2019 confidence in the current state of the economy is at a 12-year high, but their optimism about the future is deteriorating.The University of Michigan on Friday said its final reading on overall consumer sentiment during July was 93.4, up from a preliminary reading of 93.1 but down from 95.1 in June.

The Commerce Department on Friday said overall economic growth picked up in the second quarter after a slowdown in early 2017.Richard Curtin, the Michigan survey\u2019s chief economist, said a partisan gap persists in expectations about the future between cheerful Republicans and downbeat Democrats. \u201cImportantly, the partisan gap has narrowed in the past six months, mostly due to Republicans tempering their optimism,\u201d Mr. Curtin said. \u201cThe recent declines among Republicans were somewhat predictable, but the maintenance of extreme pessimism among Democrats is more surprising.\u201dIn a separate report released Tuesday, the Conference Board said its index of U.S. consumer confidence rose in July to 121.1 from June\u2019s 117.3, reflecting more positive assessments of both the current situation and the outlook. The overall index peaked in March at 124.9, its highest level since December 2000.Friday\u2019s report also showed public expectations about future price growth firmed somewhat, with average inflation of 2.7% expected over the next year and 2.6% inflation expected in five to 10 years.

Officials at the time touted myRA as a way to teach more workers the importance and ease of saving for retirement, and the initiative received support from retirement experts and groups including the AARP.The accounts are structured much like Roth IRAs, where account holders contribute money after income taxes are paid. Investment gains and withdrawals are tax-free after that. Employees can fund the accounts from their paychecks, bank accounts or from federal tax refunds.

Security forces shot the assailant dead.The additional precautions came after skirmishes flared Thursday, as Israel removed a series of security measures it had implemented at the Temple Mount after Arab gunmen killed two Israeli policemen there on July 14.The measures had sparked widespread protests among Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank. Clashes last weekend left three Palestinians dead, while three Israeli settlers were stabbed to death by a Palestinian assailant in their home during dinner.During the past two weeks, Palestinians had refused to pray at the compound, in Jerusalem\u2019s ancient Old City, until Israel removed the metal detectors, metal railings and cameras it said it had implemented for security. Israel dismantled the detectors on Tuesday and all other measures by Thursday afternoon.Despite many Palestinians seeing the measures\u2019 removal as a symbolic victory over the Israeli government, security personnel on Thursday had to disperse crowds of young Palestinians who became violent at the holy compound, Israeli police said.

But robots increasingly come in all shapes and sizes\u2014including, now, in the guise of a vine.Researchers at Stanford University and the University of California, Santa Barbara, have come up with a flexible new plastic robot that \u201cgrows\u201d from the tip without moving the rest of its body. The device can penetrate tight spaces, overcome punctures and sticky spots and expand dramatically to cover a lot of ground.One model with a 2-inch diameter started out a foot long and quickly grew to 236 feet. As the device lengthens, wires can grow with it, attached to a sensor or a camera that can provide information about the robot\u2019s environment as it progresses.How does all this happen? The robot, made of soft plastic, usually has three wires running its length. The device starts out compressed into a cylinder that includes a spool containing additional tubing from which \u201cgrowth\u201d can occur at the tip. The plastic \u201cvine\u201d is driven by air pumped into the stationary end. Controllers can steer the robot\u2014based on the video it sends back\u2014by adding air to one or another of the long control chambers running along the walls. This causes the emerging tip to bend, changing the direction of growth.In a new scientific article about their work, the scientists report taking their cues from nature, which is filled with creatures that \u201cnavigate their environments not through locomotion but through growth.\u201dAmong the uses for the robot envisioned by its inventors are emergencies requiring access to confined spaces. For example, the robot can traverse various obstacles to worm its way into a cavern or the remains of a collapsed building, where it can use a carbon-dioxide sensor at the tip to detect whether anyone remains alive. The tube could also deliver water to those who are trapped or, in a thicker version, carry water to douse a fire. More mundanely, the scientists used their device to snake a wire across the top of a dropped ceiling. They also foresee medical uses for smaller versions that could get into the human body\u2019s nooks and crannies without dragging the entire tube along.As is so often the case with modern inventions, an important part of the job was getting the software right. Controlling a soft robot is harder than controlling a rigid one, and the scientists also needed to process its camera images as they were produced. \u201cA lot of work went into designing algorithms that both ran fast and produced results that were accurate enough for controlling the soft robot,\u201d says       Joseph Greer,        one of the scientists.The researchers have made versions with diameters ranging from a fraction of an inch to more than a foot, and they have achieved a maximum expansion speed, over short distances, of 10 meters a second, or about 22 miles an hour. They have guided prototypes through obstacle courses studded with nails and run the robot under a 220-pound crate\u2014which it lifted. It also can be formed into shapes, such as a standing spiral.The team even managed to snake the robot through an opening just 10% of its diameter. \u201cThe body can be stuck to the environment or jammed between rocks,\u201d says       Elliot Hawkes,        the paper\u2019s lead author, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t stop the robot, because the tip can continue to progress as new material is added to the end.\u201d\u201cA soft robot that navigates its environment through growth,\u201d Elliot W.

Butcher Jr.\u00a0Their banking empire swiftly collapsed amid allegations that they had concealed bad loans by transferring them between banks ahead of routine examinations. Investigators determined that one concealed loan was used to finance a 60-foot yacht for Jake Butcher.Both brothers were convicted of bank fraud and other offenses and served nearly seven years apiece in federal prison.\u201cI got a lot of misery at the end,\u201d Jake Butcher said in a television interview to mark the 25th anniversary of the fair. \u201cIt was my fault. I have no one to blame but myself.\u201dBefore his fall, Mr. Butcher ran twice for governor of Tennessee. The first time, in 1974, he failed to get the Democratic nomination. The second time he ran as the Democratic nominee in 1978 and lost to Lamar Alexander.Mr. Butcher died July 19 of cancer. He was 81.As he built up his banking and other business interests in the 1970s, borrowing heavily became a habit. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you start going barefooted in the spring,\u201d he said in a 1976 interview. \u201cFor the first few days, the gravel really hurts. But then your feet toughen up and you don\u2019t notice it.\u201dRead a collection of in-depth profiles at WSJ.com/Obituaries.Jacob Franklin Butcher was born May 8, 1936, in the small town of Maynardville, Tenn. His father was a banker. The younger Mr. Butcher studied agriculture at the University of Tennessee but dropped out in his senior year. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps, including postings in Korea and Japan.In the early 1960s, Mr. Butcher founded an insurance company and an oil-distribution business. He and his brother C.H. began buying banks in the late 1960s. In 1978, Jake Butcher\u2019s United American Bank moved into a new 27-floor building, the tallest in Knoxville.He and his wife, the former Sonya Wilde, an actress whose credits include the \u201cBonanza\u201d and \u201cPerry Mason\u201d television series, lived in a 40-room white brick mansion called Whirlwind. Their guests included Jimmy Carter and Imelda Marcos. In the 13 bathrooms, some toilet seats were made of a transparent plastic encasing gold coins, according to \u201cWhirlwind,\u201d a history by Sandra Lea.Some loans by the brothers\u2019 banks proved controversial. A loan to Bert Lance, budget director in the Carter administration, was one issue in a federal investigation of his financial dealings. In 1980, Mr. Lance was tried in a federal court for bank fraud and making false financial statements. A jury deadlocked on three charges in that trial and acquitted Mr. Lance of nine others. Loans from Butcher-owned banks also featured in a federal investigation of U.S. Rep. Harold Ford, a Tennessee Democrat, in the mid-1980s. Rep. Ford was acquitted of fraud and conspiracy charges in 1993.The surge of interest rates to double-digit levels in the early 1980s and an economic slump contributed to problems with shaky loans from the Butcher brothers\u2019 banks. Regulators declared United American insolvent in February 1983, leading depositors in the brothers\u2019 other banks to pull out cash and forcing the Butchers to sell the banks.Jake Butcher initially lashed out at regulators. He told a             New York Times                   reporter that the regulators had \u201cdefamed\u201d him by closing his Knoxville bank. \u201cWhen they cut your head off, it is hard to keep your arms and legs moving,\u201d he said.He also suggested that political rivals may have thwarted him: \u201cYou can\u2019t be in both politics and business at the same time. They just won\u2019t let you.\u201dA federal grand jury indicted Mr. Butcher on 44 counts of bank fraud, falsifying bank records and conspiracy in November 1984. \u201cI am innocent,\u201d Mr. Butcher told reporters. Five months later, he reached an agreement with federal prosecutors to plead guilty.Mr. Butcher sought leniency, saying he wanted to save his marriage and work to repay victims of the collapse. Judge William K. Thomas of the Federal District Court in Knoxville told him: \u201cThe fact that you used multiple frauds to illegally obtain millions from your own banks warrants a sentence comparable to one that would be imposed on a person who used violence or the threat of violence to obtain a smaller amount of money from one of your banks.\u201dHe was sentenced to 20 years but released on parole after serving about a third of that. In prison, he did kitchen and clerical work. When the family visited, \u201che always cheered us up,\u201d said his son Brad. \u201cHe was a man of strong faith and was the king of hope.\u201dAfter his release, he worked for a Toyota dealership owned by a friend and consulted on real estate and finance issues.Mr. Butcher is survived by Sonya Wilde Butcher, four children, eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. His brother C.H. died in 2002.In a 1996 interview with the Knoxville News Sentinel, Mr. Butcher said he had put in more than 2,000 hours of community service, including work with the Special Olympics. \u201cI really feel like God has forgiven me,\u201d he said, \u201cand I really hope and trust that the people I\u2019ve offended have forgiven me, too.\u201dWrite to James R.

What he learned there inspired him to introduce Japan\u2019s first comprehensive annual medical examination system at St. Luke\u2019s in 1954.Dr. Hinohara had a personal part in some of the 20th century Japan\u2019s most dramatic events. As a young doctor, he treated victims of the American firebombing of Tokyo in World War II. Traveling to a medical conference in 1970, he was on a plane that was hijacked by terrorists who later sought asylum in North Korea. He was freed, and said later that he told himself, \u201cFrom now on, I will devote this second life that I have been given to something other than myself.\u201dWhen members of a doomsday cult released nerve gas on the Tokyo subways in 1995, one of the worst-hit stations was right near Dr. Hinohara\u2019s hospital. As survivors flooded into St. Luke\u2019s by the hundreds, Dr. Hinohara took charge, clearing out a chapel to handle the overflow.Until the turn of the century, Dr. Hinohara was known mainly in the medical profession. Then, at age 90, he published \u201cHow to Live Well,\u201d a collection of commentaries on life with his gentle visage on the cover, wearing a doctor\u2019s coat and holding a stethoscope. The book said people over 75 shouldn\u2019t be shunted to society\u2019s margins, and he exhorted his fellow elderly citizens to consider themselves \u201con the job\u201d of living even if they were retired from paid work.\u201cAnimals can\u2019t change how they crawl or run, but humans can change how they live. This is because humans alone know from the beginning that life has an ending,\u201d wrote Dr. Hinohara, \u201cGenius without limit sleeps within everyone and awaits its moment of flowering.\u201dIn a country where many companies still force their employees to retire at 60, the message resonated widely. Even after passing 100, Dr. Hinohara was flying around the country giving speeches and writing a regular column in the Asahi newspaper.He said the elderly shouldn\u2019t worry too much about their diet\u2014he himself was accustomed to making a lunch out of milk and cookies\u2014and told the story of an artist who stopped painting after being warned to lay off sweets because of high blood sugar. Dr. Hinohara relaxed the restrictions, and the artist lived until 105.\u201cEspecially when [doctors] are young, they give strict guidance to patients according to what the textbooks say. But when you tell elderly people, \u2018Stop this, reduce that,\u2019 and severely restrict their lives, you can practically see their spirit wither away,\u201d he wrote in \u201cHow to Live Well.\u201dHis causes were many\u2014hospice care, improved status for nurses and music therapy. His love of music had begun at age 10 when, kept homebound for a year by illness, he took piano lessons from the wife of a foreign missionary.\u201cHe was active his entire life. In an aging society such as Japan, I think many looked up to Dr. Hinohara as a model to be emulated and a symbol of hope,\u201d said Misako Konno, an actress who appeared with him in a documentary about nursing care.In late May, less than two months before his death from respiratory failure, he dictated his final column, expressing thanks to his readers, the Asahi said.\u201cWhen you die, you lose all your status and honors. Even the financial assets you leave behind merely sow the seeds of discord,\u201d he wrote in \u201cHow to Live Well.\u201d \u201cBut the single phrase \u2018Thank you\u2019 can save the souls of those who are left.

He crisscrossed America in corporate jets and starred in the company\u2019s goofy TV ads.Outside a distribution plant near Pittsburg, the company erected a 37-foot-high bust of Mr. Pilgrim wearing a pilgrim-style buckled hat.Yet the self-made entrepreneur, whose education ended with high school, insisted that his success was entirely due to God\u2019s guidance. In each of his three corporate jets, he placed a Bible, inscribed: \u201cJesus, thank You for the plane.\u201dHe handed out 12-page booklets on how to become a Christian\u2014and tucked a $20 bill into each one. The cash, he said, was \u201ca sign that I\u2019m serious about what I\u2019m saying.\u201dHe admitted to the occasional error. In 1989, while lobbying for changes in workers\u2019 compensation law, he handed $10,000 checks to eight members of the Texas Senate. \u201cWhat I did was neither a bribe nor illegal, but the incident was considered questionable,\u201d he wrote in a memoir. He called it a \u201cbonehead mistake.\u201dAs head of a company built largely through acquisition, he believed in seizing opportunities rather than binding himself to strategic plans. In 2006, at age 78, he agreed to pay $1.1 billion for rival Gold Kist Inc. The Lord, Mr. Pilgrim said, \u201chad foreordained the deal.\u201dWithin two years, chicken prices dropped, feed prices soared and the economy slid into recession, leaving Pilgrim\u2019s Pride overloaded with debt. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in December 2008, and the next year             JBS SA       of Brazil bought control of the firm Mr. Pilgrim had built up over six decades.Read a collection of in-depth profiles at WSJ.com/Obituaries.He died July 21 at his home in Pittsburg, about 120 miles east of Dallas, at age 89.Lonnie Pilgrim, known as Bo, was born May 8, 1928, in Pine, Texas, a town with fewer than 100 residents. He was the fourth of seven children; two others died in infancy. His father was a grocer and dealer in cotton and potatoes. The family attended the local Baptist church.Young Bo sold             Coca-Cola                   from a homemade wagon for a nickel a bottle.His father died of a heart attack when Bo was 10. The boy was so angry at his mother when she remarried three years later that he moved into a farmhouse, lacking electricity and running water, with a grandmother and an aunt. The move yielded his first experience with raising chickens. He also earned money shoveling dirt into dump trucks.His older brother Aubrey became part owner of a feed and seed store in Pittsburg in 1946.       Bo Pilgrim       drove a truck for the feed store and became a partner in the business. The brothers began buying chickens from farmers and hauling them to the Dallas-Fort Worth area for resale.In 1951, he was drafted by the Army. Though he expected to be sent to Korea, he was stationed in California and given training duties.The big animal-feed trucks and mills he saw in the West impressed him. \u201cI could hardly wait to get back to Texas to tell Aubrey about all that could be done,\u201d he wrote.After his military service, the brothers\u2019 business evolved into chicken and turkey processing as demand for lean white meat grew. Aubrey Pilgrim died of a heart attack in 1966, leaving Bo Pilgrim to press on as head of a company eventually listed on the New York Stock Exchange and exporting to 70 countries.During a rough patch in 1988, when Pilgrim\u2019s Pride was losing about $1 million a week, Mr. Pilgrim came close to selling his firm to             Tyson Foods Inc.,       but Tyson backed away. A director of Pilgrim said, \u201cBo, the Lord has given your company back to you.\u201d It recovered to profitability within five months.Mr. Pilgrim was proud of creating jobs at processing plants in rural areas, though that sometimes exposed him to criticism. A 1994 investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that breaks at one Pilgrim\u2019s Pride plant were brief and infrequent, and exhausted workers \u201cappeared to be sleepwalking through the latter part of their shift.\u201dMr. Pilgrim, who taught Sunday school for more than 50 years, is survived by his wife of 61 years, Patty. She was still a teenager when he met her at a wedding. He was a decade older and had to overcome her parents\u2019 initial doubts about his suitability. Survivors also include a sister, three children, six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.Mr. Pilgrim\u2019s habit was to get up around 5 a.m. and make a breakfast of two eggs and turkey sausage. \u201cI\u2019m always eager to find out what God has on my schedule and agenda,\u201d he wrote.Write to James R.

It was borrowed from the Dutch word \u201cbelegeren,\u201d which in turn comes from the word \u201cleger\u201d meaning \u201cmilitary camp.\u201d The \u201cbe-\u201d prefix means \u201caround\u201d (also seen in words like \u201cbeset,\u201d \u201cbesiege\u201d and \u201cbesmear\u201d), so the verb suggests a sieging force encircling its target on all sides, preventing escape.The word \u201cleger\u201d had previously entered Old English from an earlier Germanic source, with the related meaning of \u201ca place to lie down.\u201d That gave rise to the modern word \u201clair,\u201d for a place where wild animals dwell. On another branch of the tree from the same Germanic root is \u201clager,\u201d named after the storehouse where the beer is slowly fermented.\u201cBeleaguer\u201d came in from Dutch at a time when England and Holland were often involved in military entanglements, which ended up enriching the English lexicon. Other words taken from Dutch around the same time include \u201cfurlough\u201d (from \u201cverlof\u201d) and \u201cknapsack\u201d (from \u201cknapzak,\u201d literally a \u201csnack bag\u201d).A 1587 treatise by a soldier named       Barnabe Rich,        \u201cA Pathway to Military Practice,\u201d included \u201cobservations as well for those that shall beleaguer, as for the besieged.\u201d Soon after its entrance into English, \u201cbeleaguer\u201d (like \u201cbesiege\u201d before it) became applied to nonmilitary situations for more metaphorical assaults.In modern political parlance, \u201cbeleaguered\u201d has become\u2014along with \u201cembattled\u201d\u2014a common description of officials embroiled in scandals or other predicaments. A 1991 book by the political scientist       Aaron Wildavsky,        surveying the crises faced by presidents from       Lyndon Johnson       onward, was entitled \u201cThe Beleaguered Presidency.\u201d And just last week, after       Sean Spicer       resigned as White House press secretary, the Los Angeles Times referred to Mr. Trump as \u201cthe beleaguered president.\u201dBy directing the word at Mr. Sessions, Mr. Trump may have decided it is better to be the beleaguerer than the beleagueree.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-dutch-based-beleaguered-ended-up-in-a-trump-tweet-1501252127", "keywords": [" attorney general, beleaguered, ben zimmer, etymology, politics, sessions, trump,white house, word usage,political,general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 09:48:00", "news_title": "Sears Canada\u2019s Largest Stockholders Call Off Joint Bankruptcy Bid   ", "content": "Eddie Lampert       and       Bruce Berkowitz       called off a potential joint bankruptcy deal for Sears Canada Inc., clearing the way for other bidders to challenge its two largest shareholders.The two hedge-fund managers on Friday terminated a joint legal engagement ahead of an Aug. 31 bid deadline.

The figures were in line with economists\u2019 expectations.Firming growth should help Mr. Macron as he attempts to address France\u2019s gaping deficits and high unemployment, which have left its economy trailing Germany\u2019s and other European peers.The 39-year-old president has prescribed deep spending cuts to close the deficit and a loosening of labor laws to encourage businesses to hire. Stronger growth could help smooth the possible disruption to the job market from the changes and support incomes and employment as the state tightens its belt.\u201cIt\u2019s not the worst moment for these policies because we are in a positive phase in the economic cycle,\u201d said       Xavier Timbeau,        an economist at publicly funded economic observatory OFCE.Friday\u2019s GDP figures\u2014the first covering a period of Mr. Macron\u2019s presidency\u2014showed a strong rise in exports after a contraction in the first three months of the year. Consumer spending picked up, rising 0.3% on the quarter, after 0.1% growth in the first three months of 2017.Business investment continued to grow, although at a slower rate than the start of the year, when companies rushed to make use of expiring tax incentives.The strength of the underlying economy is a relief for the government after Mr. Macron\u2019s economic plans recently ran into obstacles.In June, a report by the state auditor revealed a wider-than-expected deficit, pushing the government to make additional spending cuts. The cuts sparked a public row with the army that ended with the resignation of France\u2019s top military commander.Mr. Macron\u2019s approval ratings have dropped since he came to power, reaching 54%, according to a survey last week by Ifop, down from 64% in June.Still, consumer and business surveys have improved to multiyear highs since Mr. Macron\u2019s election, raising hopes for a stronger economic rebound. France is also benefiting from the European Central Bank\u2019s record low interest rates and vast asset-purchase program, which the Bank of France says has boosted growth and jobs.Business leaders say Mr. Macron must now deliver on labor overhauls to sustain the economic uptick and bring down the 9.6% unemployment rate.Schneider Electric\u2019s       chief executive       Jean-Pascal Tricoire       said his company had a relatively flat first half in its home market, as it was waiting for renewed confidence after Mr. Macron\u2019s election in May to translate into sales. Only a fraction of the electrical equipment maker\u2019s business is in France, but it is exposed to a broad cross section of industrial clients.\u201cFrance is doing better in terms of morale after the election; now reforms need to happen to generate investment and business development,\u201d Mr. Tricoire said.Mr. Macron\u2019s government is currently consulting with labor and business unions to prepare decrees that would make sweeping changes to labor laws as part of a fast-track parliamentary procedure. The government aims to give businesses greater latitude to work around rules set by unions and encourage hiring by limiting the costs and legal uncertainties of laying off staffSome businesses are concerned Mr. Macron will bow to resistance from labor unions and water down the plans.       Fran\u00e7ois Asselin,        the head of business lobby CPME that is negotiating with the government on behalf of small companies, said that even as the economy picks up pace, many of the executives he represents might still avoid hiring.\u201cIf the government really reforms the labor code in a courageous, significant way, there will be a positive impact,\u201d Mr. Asselin said.The pickup in French growth has aided the eurozone\u2019s economic recovery in the first half of 2017. The currency area\u2019s growth has surprised this year, as it outpaced the U.S. in the first quarter and may have accelerated further in the three months to June. Growth figures for the second quarter will be released Aug. 1.Data from Spain also released Friday showed the economy grew at 0.9% on the quarter in the three months through June. This is a pickup from the first three months of the year that puts the eurozone\u2019s fourth-largest economy on track for growth of more than 3.1% in 2017.The currency area\u2019s faster recovery appears set to continue in coming months, with a measure of business and consumer confidence for July released Friday rising to its highest level since August 2007.As 2017 began, many economists expected eurozone growth to slow in response to high levels of political uncertainty ahead of elections in France, the Netherlands and Germany and a fall in exports to the U.K. as a consequence of the pound\u2019s depreciation after the June 2016 Brexit vote.Ireland was expected to be one of the eurozone economies to suffer most, given its close ties to Britain. But the country\u2019s central bank raised its growth forecast for 2017 to 4.5% from 3.5% on Friday, and for 2018 to 3.6% from 3.2%.\u201cRevised projections for growth this year and in 2018 reflect both stronger momentum in the domestic economy and improved prospects for external demand, especially from our European trading partners,\u201d Gabriel Fagan, the central bank\u2019s chief economist, said.\u2014Paul Hannon in London and Jeannette Neumann in Madrid contributed to this article.Write to William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-economys-growth-in-second-quarter-boosts-macron-after-setbacks-1501219816", "keywords": ["bond markets,economic news,economy,emmanuel macron,employment,european union,foreign exchange,france ,french economy,french government,gdp,gross domestic product,growth,investors,labor,politics,statistics agency Insee,Emmanuel Macron,personnel,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,political,general news,general labor issues,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,debt,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 09:35:00", "news_title": "Chevron Swings to Profit, Buoyed by Cost Cuts", "content": "Chevron Corp.

This marked the seventh straight monthly gain in economic output, a feat last achieved in 2010.Traders had anticipated a smaller 0.2% rise in Canadian GDP, according to economists at             Royal Bank of Canada.\u201cThere appears to be no holding back the Canadian economy,\u201d said       Brian DePratto,        economist at TD Bank, of the May report.On a one-year basis, the economy grew 4.6% in May, or the fastest pace in nearly two decades. In May of last year, the economy contracted steeply due to wildfires in western Canada that forced the shutdown or curtailment at energy-production plants.Fourteen of the 20 sectors tracked posted month-over-month advances. Overall, the goods-producing sector drove the surprise result, climbing 1.6% in May, while the services component climbed 0.2%.The better-than-expected performance in May comes weeks after the Bank of Canada opted to raise its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point, to 0.75%, marking the first rate increase in seven years. The central bank cited an improving economy that is soaking up unused labor and production capacity at an accelerated pace. It added that growth is broadening on an industrial and regional basis.\u201cThe fact is that every single major surprise for the economy this year has been to the upside,\u201d said       Doug Porter,        chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cWith this powerful momentum, even if some of it is a passing phase, it will take a lot to knock the Bank of Canada off its gradual tightening path.\u201dBank of Canada watchers generally expect at least one more rate increase in 2017 and possibly more next year.Canada\u2019s GDP rose 3.7% annualized in the first quarter, or tops among Group of Seven developed economies.

Mr. Porter said following the May report, second-quarter GDP growth is now on track to hit 3.5%, and the economy as a whole could expand 3% in 2017.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department released preliminary second-quarter GDP data, and they indicated that U.S. economic growth accelerated in the second quarter, rising at a 2.6% annual rate.In the May GDP report, Statistics Canada said the energy sector rose 4.4% from the previous month, partly attributable to a rebound in activity at an upgrader that was forced to shut down earlier this year due to a fire.Manufacturing rose 1.1% on increased production of motor vehicles and parts, and industrial machinery.Financial services grew 0.9%, on increased lending activity. Retail and wholesale trade also posted strong results, rising 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively, in May.One notable sector that weighed on results was construction, which declined 0.6% in May from April.

Beset for years by negative interest rates, hefty legal settlements and bumpy strategy changes, the sector appears to have turned a corner, although a strong recovery isn\u2019t at hand yet.UBS said its net profit rose 14% during the second quarter to 1.17 billion Swiss francs ($1.21 billion), as its wealth management unit saw 7.5 billion francs in net new money. Credit Suisse posted net income of 303 million francs, above market forecasts and compared with a year-earlier profit of 170 million francs. Net new assets increased by nearly 23 billion francs in the first half of the year, pushing assets under management to a record high.Meanwhile, on Monday, Swiss private bank Julius Baer said assets under management grew to 355 billion francs midyear, up 6% from the end of 2016.Credit Suisse delivered a \u201cstrong set of results against weak expectations,\u201d said analysts at             Morgan Stanley,       adding that the outlook for the bank\u2019s risk-weighted assets needed clarification.Morgan Stanley said UBS\u2019s results were \u201cfundamentally strong\u2026yet also against elevated expectations.\u201dCredit Suisse shares were up 2.6% Friday afternoon in Europe. UBS shares were down 2.1%, but had increased more in the run-up to Friday\u2019s results.UBS and Credit Suisse have turned their focus to wealth management and scaled back investment banking, which can be profitable, but is also volatile and costly to operate. UBS started this process years ahead of Credit Suisse, which is midway through a three-year strategic program launched by Mr. Thiam.UBS CEO       Sergio Ermotti       said Friday that the institution had \u201czero regret\u201d for gearing its portfolio more toward wealth management and maintaining a more focused and capital-light investment bank. He cited independent experts who expect the wealth-management industry to grow twice as fast as global gross domestic product in the next five to 10 years.And while operating revenues in UBS\u2019s investment banking unit were flat last quarter, \u201canyone who says our investment bank is dilutive is nuts,\u201d Mr. Ermotti said.The refocusing process at Credit Suisse has been rocky and exposed internal divisions. The low point came one year into Mr. Thiam\u2019s tenure, when Credit Suisse shares dipped below 10 francs a share. The stock has recovered to 15 francs, well below the level around 25 francs when Mr. Thiam took the helm.Mr. Thiam said Credit Suisse\u2019s share performance was typical of banks doing major restructuring and that Credit Suisse had the added headwind of starting the process during a rocky period in financial markets. The capital hike also diluted share value.\u201cI never doubted the outcome, it [the early phases of restructuring] was just unpleasant,\u201d Mr. Thiam said.Credit Suisse lost 2.4 billion francs last year, mostly due to a legal settlement with the U.S. over crisis-era mortgage-backed securities. Still, its financial position was strong enough in the spring for the bank to shelve plans to sell a chunk of its profitable Swiss unit and raise capital by listing additional shares instead. The Swiss unit posted a strong profit last quarter.The prospects for UBS, Credit Suisse and other Swiss banks are key to the Alpine country\u2019s economy.Although the number of banks has fallen sharply in the past 20 years, the financial sector still generates\u2014directly and indirectly\u2014about 13% of Swiss GDP, according to a study by BAK Basel.One positive from the reduction in banks\u2014particularly the number of private banks\u2014is there are fewer bankers chasing wealthy clients.

According to data from 2015, the most recent available, 7% of investment managers in the $15 trillion mutual-fund industry were female, according to Morningstar Inc. That is down from 10% in 2009.Among its efforts, the nonprofit group organizes an intensive summer educational program, joining with professors at several large universities and executives at asset-management firms. Following this four-week education program, where these college students receive what Ms. Hingorani calls a \u201ccrash-course M.B.A.,\u201d the students\u00a0then embark on\u00a0six-week paid internships at firms such as             Bank of America Corp.      ,             Oaktree Capital Group                   LLC and Wellington Management Co.This summer, about 60 women are taking part in the program, which began on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. Next year, the group hopes to have about 100 women at Penn and the University of Notre Dame.\u201cMore gender diverse teams get better outcomes. The firms believe that, they just don\u2019t know how to get it,\u201d said Ms. Hingorani, who has had a long career working for such firms as\u00a0Pyramis Global Advisors, a unit of Fidelity Investments, and             T. Rowe Price Group Inc.She said when she had asked most investment executives why they don\u2019t have more women, the most common answer was they don\u2019t get resumes from women.Within the asset-management industry, alternative assets\u2014which includes private equity, real estate and hedge funds\u2014has the lowest percentage of female representation. Adding a few more women to these areas, which run large pools of money, could help Girls Who Invest reach its goal of having 30% of the world\u2019s investible\u00a0capital managed by women by 2030, Ms. Hingorani says.The issue of women in management\u00a0was in focus\u00a0this week\u00a0after index-fund giant State Street said it voted against the re-election of directors at 400 companies this year on grounds they failed to take steps to add women to their boards.\u00a0The money manager, a unit of State Street Corp., said it discovered that 476 companies whose shares it owned lacked a single female board member. Of that group, the Boston-based firm said 400 companies failed to make any significant effort to address the issue.State Street, which oversees more than $2.5 trillion in assets, had pledged in March to throw its weight behind the issue of gender diversity this year. The firm commissioned and placed a bronze statue of a young girl across from the iconic bull on Wall Street.Ms. Hingorani, over the past few years, met with industry executives, endowment chairs, college professors and college students directly to launch the program. Many of the asset-management firms that financially back the program\u2014which is free for the students\u2014also take on a student as an intern.Ms. Hingorani\u2019s hope is to expand the program to a total of 150 students and three locations within the next few years. Students don\u2019t have to be finance majors to apply, with liberal arts, engineers and other majors accepted.The one thing she doesn\u2019t want is too much expansion.\u201cIt\u2019s more than just educating women.

In that 82-degree environment, the shrimp will be harvested into nine different sizes\u2014the largest being 35 grams, or \u201cextra-jumbo\u201d shrimp.The last step in the process will be trucking the shrimp back to Marshall, where they will be prepared for consumers at the processing facility. The first harvest is set to take place in July 2019.But others in the shrimping industry caution that the new venture will have a tough time matching the prices of Southeast Asian growers who control roughly 90% of the U.S. market and have faced criticism for polluting ponds with chemical waste.\u201cThe person going into a             Wal-Mart                   looking for the cheapest package of shrimp\u2014if that\u2019s the buying decision, what it\u2019s going to cost\u2014it\u2019s tough to compete,\u201d said C. David Veal, executive director of the American Shrimp Processors Association, which advocates for the wild-caught shrimping industry in Gulf Coast states and the South Atlantic.Mr. Ziebell said tr\u016b Shrimp\u2019s operation is different because their production sites will be highly controlled, indoor facilities completely free of antibiotics.Marshall Mayor Robert Byrnes said raising shrimp won\u2019t be as foreign to local workers as it might seem\u2014they are already raising hogs and turkeys.\u201cThe veterinary needs, the medical needs, the biosecurity and disease control\u2014that\u2019s all very important for all animal production, and it would be especially important for shrimp production,\u201d Mr. Byrnes said.The roughly 14,000-person city in southwest Minnesota, about 70 miles north of Luverne, is the homebase for both Ralco and Schwan Food Co. With a below-average unemployment rate, the community functions as the regional center for employment, health care and education.\u201cMarshall is a community that really is based on food production and agricultural value-added production,\u201d Mr. Byrnes said.Appeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'Jumbo-Size Dreams for Minnesota Aquaculture.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/minnesota-firm-hopes-to-make-a-big-splashwith-shrimp-1501246802", "keywords": ["Ralco,Michael Ziebell,political,general news,natural environment"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 08:38:00", "news_title": "U.S. Employment Costs Decelerated in Second Quarter", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A broad gauge of U.S. wages and benefits advanced only modestly this spring, the latest sign of little pressure on labor costs despite what appears to be a tight labor market.The employment-cost index for civilian workers increased a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in the second quarter, the Labor Department said Friday.

Have you made your Friday lunch plans yet? How about a yacon salad with a side of kohlrabi slaw? No idea what I\u2019m on about? Feast your eyes on this WSJ feature about the marketing efforts behind the making of the next \u201cit\u201d vegetable.For all of marketers\u2019 moaning about the perennial problems of the online advertising ecosystem\u2014bots, fraud, ad tech tax, viewability, measurement\u2014spend on digital ads keeps going up and up. But Procter & Gamble is one advertiser that has been protesting those issues with its budget. P&G said it pulled $100 million in digital marketing spend in its most recent quarter and its business was largely unaffected, CMO Today reported. Digital platforms will wheeze at this quote from P&G\u2019s finance chief, Jon Moeller, who said the cut ads were \u201cineffective, where either we were serving bots as opposed to human beings or where the placement of ads was not facilitating the equity of our brands.\u201d Will P&G\u2019s cutbacks have an impact on the big digital players? Probably not. As GroupM Chief Digital Officer Rob Norman sardonically pointed out on Twitter, Google and Facebook managed to \u201ceke out a little growth\u201d despite these \u201cheadwinds\u201d (their ad revenues were up 18% and 47%, respectively, in the most recent quarter).Many people in Adland think Amazon is the player best positioned to challenge the so-called \u201cduopoly\u201d of Google and Facebook. But Amazon\u2019s ad unit is relatively modest: eMarketer predicts it will take just a 0.8% share of the global digital ad market this year. Amazon\u2019s execs were once again predictably mum on its ad business on the company\u2019s earnings call yesterday, but we did find out a couple of things. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said the hiring rate within Amazon\u2019s ad sales team is exceeding the company\u2019s growth rate because, while it has built some self-service tools recently, \u201cwe realize that we will need actual sales contact with the accounts as well.\u201d Amazon lumps its advertising division in its \u201cother\u201d segment. Net sales in that segment (most of which is thought to consist of ad sales) grew 51% from a year ago to $945 million in the second quarter. But that growth rate slowed from the 58% posted in the first quarter. Mr. Olsavsky said advertising revenue has been \u201cstrong and fairly consistent over the past three quarters,\u201d but didn\u2019t offer more detail. Throw us a bone, Amazon!We\u2019ve heard a lot about joint ventures in the digital ad business recently, whether it\u2019s publishers and broadcasters setting aside their rivalries to form combined sales units, or Adobe launching its \u201ccross-device co-op\u201d to help marketers track customers as they switch between devices. Now here\u2019s another: Ad tech firm Criteo is asking retailers, brands and publishers to share their data to help them better target customers and track sales online and offline, I reported for CMO Today. It\u2019s pitched as an effort to encourage consumers to shop outside the Amazon ecosystem. Will it work? That depends on whether Criteo manages to sign up enough partners to create a network effect and whether its technology can accurately decipher all the different ways brands store their data in order to create universal identifiers that work for everyone. Criteo will also need to prove that the benefits of entering a data pool with their rivals outweighs the risks. And with Amazon\u2019s growing Prime membership ranks dissuading those members from shopping outside Amazon, will ads on the wider web be able to change consumer habits?We\u2019re all so \u201cbusy,\u201d aren\u2019t we?

He chewed an inordinate amount of gum on the course.Spieth\u2019s impromptu decision to chew his way through his first and second rounds at Royal Birkdale sparked an unlikely debate about whether gum plays a role in sports performance. It became a wide-ranging discussion both on the Golf Channel broadcast and on social media.And it left most observers seemingly unsure what to make of it. Was this a meaningless quirk unrelated to Spieth\u2019s victory? Or should pro shops around the world start pushing aside Titleists to clear a shelf for Trident?\u201cI think mint has some sort of effect on nerves,\u201d Spieth said, though he wasn\u2019t sure that was true for him, since he said after his opening round that he still felt nervous.There is some science behind Spieth\u2019s suggestion. A 2012 study published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition examined the impact of peppermint on sports performance. It compared the athletic performance characteristics of a dozen college students on a treadmill before and after they consumed peppermint essential oil for 10 days.The result: Subjects showed significant improvement in performance, with lower blood pressure and lower heart rates, after their peppermint binge. But the mint oil they consumed was mixed with water. What about chewing gum?There is evidence to suggest that can be helpful to a golfer, too. In 2011, researchers from St. Lawrence University published a study that explored the cognitive advantages of chewing gum. It found a positive correlation between chewing gum and the speed at which the brain processes information. It also suggested that chewing gum increases the brain\u2019s ability to hold and manipulate spatial information.\u201cFor instance, in golf, in planning a complex shot,\u201d said Serge Onyper, a co-author of the study.There is a caveat, however. The study indicated that those benefits are realized only after the gum is chewed and discarded\u2014not while it is being chewed. If Spieth was aided by continuing to chew the gum for hours, then, it would likely have been a placebo effect.Spieth did not disclose the particular type of gum he was chewing. By the time he got out on the driving range to warm up for his opening round, he said he had already eaten breakfast and brushed his teeth. But his swing coach, Cameron McCormick, offered him a piece of gum, so he took it.After two holes, already at 1 under par, Spieth said he figured he might as well just leave it in his mouth. At a news conference more than five hours after taking McCormick up on his offer, Spieth was still chewing it.\u201cIt\u2019s still in now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably time for a new piece.\u201dIn basketball, Michael Jordan was a prolific gum-chewer. Major League Baseball dugouts have long been stocked with gum for every game. But the sight of Spieth chomping away in high-definition over 18 holes was unusual for golf. Though the late, three-time major winner Payne Stewart was a known gum-chewer, the habit has never widely caught on.Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee said it was hard to say why. \u201cPerhaps because one might find it hard to swing a club and not swallow or spit out the gum,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps because no one has invented a gum where the flavor lasts five hours and handing your caddie a piece of chewed gum is, in a comical way, borderline degrading.\u201dDuring the British Open broadcast, Spieth surpassing the five-hour mark was treated with almost as much awe as Branden Grace posting the lowest score in major championship history in the third round.\u201cThe same piece of gum for five hours?\u201d the analyst and three-time Open champion Nick Faldo said. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. That\u2019s impossible.\u201dThe gum marathon prompted one reporter to jokingly suggest to Spieth that it may have been performance-enhancing gum, to which Spieth responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think that exists.\u201dBut actually, it does, if one considers caffeine to be a performance aid.Caffeine, which is perfectly legal in golf and other sports, has been shown in numerous studies to boost athletic performance and\u2014yes\u2014is available in the form of chewing gum. It has become popular among some endurance athletes because it does not pass through the digestive system, meaning it delivers an energy boost faster than coffee.Carl Paton, an associate professor at New Zealand\u2019s Eastern Institute of Technology, has conducted three studies on the impact of caffeinated gum on athletes in two other sports: cycling and rugby. He said he has found a consistent performance boost of between 2% to 4% in athletes that chew the gum.While his research did not touch on golf, he said caffeinated gum would likely help there too, given other studies that show the benefits of caffeine in general on amateur golfers.A 2015 study published by the American College of Sports Medicine found that caffeinated golfers drive the ball further, hit their irons with greater accuracy and score better than their non-caffeinated peers.To be sure, there is no evidence that Spieth\u2019s gum was caffeinated or beneficial in any way. He did not appear to chew gum during his Saturday and Sunday rounds. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s beneficial at all,\u201d he said. To win the Claret Jug, his stellar play, his ability to think his way around the course and his stirring finish were more than enough.For everyone else, the science is clear: Drink peppermint essential oil, load up on caffeine and if at all possible, find a stick of gum that combines the two. Just don\u2019t chew it for five hours.Write to Brian Costa at brian.costa@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-chewing-gum-boost-your-golf-game-1501242000", "keywords": ["british open,chewing gum,golf,golf gum,jordan spieth,pga tour,spieth,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 07:30:00", "news_title": "LPs Bless Bessemer\u2019s Move Into Crypto Investing", "content": "Institutional investors are throwing their weight behind the crypto-tokens craze.Bessemer Venture Partners has received approval from its limited partners to use its fund to buy digital currencies directly, according to a person familiar with the situation.The move comes as Union Square Ventures and other big venture firms, open up to using their funds to buy crypto-tokens, while their institutional backers give managers some leeway in the nascent market for digital currencies. A flurry of tech startups have raised funding by launching crypto-tokens that can be redeemed for services and can be a tradable asset.Most venture firms that have started investing in crypto-tokens say they are being cautious, citing regulatory concerns and the froth in the market of new-coin generation. But they also fear missing out on a potentially lucrative opportunity.At the same time, venture firms need to loop in their limited partners about using investment funds in this uncharted territory. Crypto-tokens don\u2019t confer ownership of a company, nor do they come with investor protection like liquidation preferences.Larchmont, N.Y.-based Bessemer, which manages a $1.6 billion fund, has put some capital into two funds that trade digital currencies, according to       Alex Ferrara,        a partner with the firm. One of these funds is managed by Metastable Capital, and the other by Polychain Capital. Mr. Ferrara declined to say how much Bessemer invested.For its part, Metastable has also received investments from other venture funds, including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Union Square Ventures, and Founders Fund, according to another person familiar with the situation. Pantera Capital, a crypto-focused venture fund that has raised $35 million in a venture fund dedicated to coin offerings, aims to cap the fund at $100 million.Bessemer is considering making investments in initial coin offerings, Mr. Ferrara said. He declined to comment on the firm\u2019s agreements with its LPs.For Bessemer, the decision to get involved in cryptocurrencies marks a shift for a firm that has long stayed on the sidelines as other investors placed bets on blockchain technology, which underlies bitcoin, ethereum and other digital currencies.Mr. Ferrara said that about three years ago, he and other partners at Bessemer concluded that it made more sense to buy bitcoin itself than to invest in startups built for the currency\u2019s ecosystem. But they also decided that Bessemer, as an institutional fund, couldn\u2019t easily trade in bitcoin and therefore stayed out of the market.\u201cEarly on we thought that bitcoin would be the one and only digital currency to emerge and there would be some strong network effects that would result,\u201d Mr. Ferrara said. \u201cThen we realized with the coin offering of ethereum that we were wrong.\u201dEthereum, he added, is spurring new tech development and a proliferation of new coins.New funds like Metastable that are specially designed to evaluate and safely hold crypto-tokens are also helping to make digital-currency investments more palatable to the firm.Mr. Ferrara said most issuers of tokens are only \u201cresearch projects,\u201d not conventional companies. There\u2019s little evidence to date, he said, that any of them have effectively competed with businesses that aren\u2019t based on blockchain.Write to Yuliya Chernova at yuliya.chernova@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lps-bless-bessemers-move-into-crypto-investing-1501241400", "keywords": ["bitcoin,blockchain,btc,ethereum,icos,initial coin offerings,Bessemer Venture Partners,Sequoia Capital,founders fund,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,banking,credit,financial services,financial technology,investing,securities,technology,venture capital,virtual currencies"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 07:00:00", "news_title": "Sapphire Reserve Cards Aren\u2019t Very Rewarding for J.P. Morgan ", "content": "J.P. Morgan        JPM 0.90%       Chase & Co.\u2019s Sapphire Reserve credit card has been popular with consumers\u2014maybe too popular.Some at J.P. Morgan are raising concerns that Sapphire Reserve won\u2019t make money for the bank, due in part to high demand and the card\u2019s generous rewards. Meanwhile, the lender is pushing for\u00a0about\u00a0$200 million in fresh cost cuts in the unit that oversees the card, people familiar with the matter say.The scrutiny inside the bank reflects changing economics of the competitive premium card market. Rewards for consumers\u2014paid for by the bank\u2014have gotten sweeter. Spenders, meanwhile, are growing savvier about maximizing\u00a0benefits\u00a0and avoiding balances that pad banks\u2019 profits.J.P. Morgan says it is making a long-term bet on the millennial customers who favor the card. Prospects will become clearer in August, one year after its launch, when the first Sapphire Reserve customers will decide whether they want to spend $450 on the card\u2019s annual renewal fee. If many flee, it would add to the anxiety.Gordon Smith, head of J.P. Morgan\u2019s retail-banking business, this month ordered up cost trims at the unit overseeing cards, the people familiar with the matter said.\u00a0A bank spokeswoman, Trish Wexler, said any midyear cuts would take into account overall expense targets regardless of specific products.\u201cAs part of any planning process you\u2019re always looking for ways to eliminate waste,\u201d she said. \u201dThat\u2019s just good fiscal hygiene.\u201dStill, internal concerns about the card are growing\u2014surprising for what has been seen as a blockbuster at the nation\u2019s largest bank\u00a0by assets. At recent\u00a0meetings, senior J.P. Morgan\u00a0employees\u00a0reviewed models questioning whether\u00a0the card would\u00a0make money and when, the people familiar with the process said.Banks including J.P. Morgan generate credit-card revenue from the annual fees customers pay, the interest charged on their balances and the fees merchants pay when the card is used at their businesses. The bank\u00a0pays out\u00a0when it offers rewards, such as the\u00a0100,000-point sign-up bonus that J.P. Morgan\u00a0initially offered on Sapphire Reserve.The bank offered the bonus for about five months after the card\u2019s launch. It estimated\u00a0the reward was worth about $1,500 per customer if used on travel, along with an additional $300\u00a0annual travel credit.J.P. Morgan doesn\u2019t disclose how many Chase Sapphire Reserve cards it has issued. The bank said it exceeded its 12-month sales\u00a0target\u00a0in two weeks and temporarily ran out of the metal used to make the cards.J.P. Morgan\u2019s second-quarter card income, as reported, fell 15% from the year-earlier period to\u00a0$1.06 billion. Credit-card account openings, excluding commercial cards, totaled 2.1 million, down 22% from the year-earlier quarter.Bank executives acknowledge that it doesn\u2019t immediately make money on each new card and customer. \u201cYou expense the acquisition costs over 12 months. The benefit comes over seven years,\u201d J.P. Morgan Chairman and Chief Executive       James Dimon       said on a conference call this month.\u201cThese are the customers that everybody wants to acquire,\u201d       Marianne Lake,        the bank\u2019s chief financial officer, said on the call. \u201cWe now have them, and we intend to deepen relationships with them.\u201dThe big question is whether the consumers want to stay in this relationship. Customer renewal rates for premium credit cards can range from 60% to 90%, said Robert Hammer, founder and CEO of credit-card industry consultant R.K. Hammer. Some 5% to 10% of card holders tend to \u201cshop around,\u201d looking for new rewards, he adds.American Express Co.\u2019s       Platinum card and             Citigroup Inc.\u2019s       \u00a0Prestige card have been pushing to win over Sapphire Reserve customers.\u00a0J.P. Morgan has tried to avoid signing up potential defectors by rejecting\u00a0applicants who have opened up five new credit cards in the previous 24 months, known internally as the \u201c5-24 rule.\u201d\u201cThey\u00a0may\u00a0need to recalibrate those benefits\u201d\u00a0that come with the Sapphire Reserve card,\u00a0said\u00a0RBC Capital Markets banking analyst Gerard Cassidy \u201dThere\u2019s always that risk of having benefits to the card customer that are greater than needed.\u201dOne problem for Sapphire Reserve: Fewer customers than the bank initially imagined are holding balances, according to the people familiar with the matter.\u00a0That lowers interest income generated by the card and forces the bank to focus on merchant-driven \u201cinterchange\u201d revenue\u2014which at about 2.5% of dollars spent is generally less lucrative than interest income.Cardholders have proven adept at squeezing the most rewards out of Sapphire Reserve, often using it for travel and dining, categories where J.P. Morgan\u00a0generally pays more to cover rewards. Consumers also are likely to book travel through Chase\u2019s rewards website for an additional 50% bonus that the bank covers.Sapphire Reserve customers have been helping the bank in other ways, though.\u00a0About 4,300 cardholders have applied for new mortgages with J.P. Morgan under a program offering 100,000 reward points. That\u2019s about twice the number of mortgage applications from other Sapphire card customers last year, Ms. Wexler said.\u201cMore than 95% of our customers are spending actively, are digitally engaged, and are retaining their relationship with us,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s still early, but we\u2019ve never seen numbers like this.\u201d\u2014AnnaMaria Andriotis contributed to this story.Write to Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sapphire-reserve-cards-arent-very-rewarding-for-j-p-morgan-1501239601", "keywords": ["marketing to millennials,millennials,millennials favorite products,sapphire,sapphire rewards,sapphire rewards card,J.P.

The average price U.S. consumers paid for a dozen eggs last month was $1.33, down 48% from two years ago, according to federal data.\u201cThis is historic,\u201d said Brian Moscogiuri, an analyst who tracks the egg market for Urner Barry.Earlier in the decade, the egg market enjoyed a strong run thanks to consumers\u2019 growing appetite for protein and all-day breakfast offerings at restaurant chains. But bird flu led to the destruction of 34 million egg-laying hens as it struck farms in 2015.The resulting egg shortfalls and record high prices drove producers to quickly refill their barns, bringing the nation\u2019s egg-laying hen population to an all-time high of 319 million in December 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. flock overall has shrunk since then, but egg production in June still totaled about 7.5 billion, close to the monthly record of 8 billion reached late last year.Demand for U.S. eggs hasn\u2019t rebounded nearly as quickly.U.S. egg exports have picked up this year, but they remain below levels seen before the onset of bird flu as buyers such as Mexico and Canada import eggs from alternative suppliers or produce more themselves. According to the USDA, the U.S. exported the equivalent of 170 million dozen eggs last year, or 55% less than the 375 million dozen shipped overseas in 2014.Some U.S. food makers like bakeries and other companies that use egg products also have been slow to embrace eggs again. High prices compelled some to reformulate their recipes, substituting in ingredients like soy or whey protein or simply making do with fewer eggs.Recent bird flu outbreaks on farms across Europe and Asia have given food companies further cause to stick with egg alternatives rather than risking another supply disruption, industry officials say. Another deterrent is the time and expense of changing their labels back to include eggs.\u201cA couple of years ago, people were sometimes pretty desperate to make changes,\u201d said       Mark Matlock,        head of food research for             Archer Daniels Midland Co.        ADM 1.45%      , which makes grain- and soy-based egg alternatives for products like cakes, cookies and pasta. \u201cThere\u2019s a cost associated with changing back.\u201dStockpiles of dried eggs, an egg product used in goods like cake mixes, topped 30 million pounds earlier this year, the highest level in a decade, according to Urner Barry\u2019s Mr. Moscogiuri.Cal-Maine said higher supplies have pressured prices for both commodity eggs and the premium varieties, such as cage-free, that Cal-Maine has prioritized in recent years.Post Holdings Inc.       in May reported a $4.2 million quarterly loss after profit from its Michael Foods subsidiary, which sells precooked eggs and liquid egg whites to restaurants and grocery stores, declined by nearly half.Even in a business prone to booms and busts, \u201cthis is pretty severe,\u201d said       Bob Krouse,        chief executive of Indiana-based Midwest Poultry Services LP. The company raises about 10 million birds and says it is one of the 10 biggest U.S. egg producers. Mr. Krouse said he is trying to rein in costs, though many of his company\u2019s expenses are related to animal health and welfare and can\u2019t be pared back.For producers able to weather a prolonged period of losses, some see relief in sight, with low egg prices triggering an increase in demand from some export markets. U.S. grocery chains, locked in a fierce battle for shoppers, also are discounting eggs as a way to get shoppers through the door.Mr. Krouse said he recently saw eggs on sale for 49 cents a dozen at discount grocery chain Aldi, adding: \u201cEggs as a value item at stores are moving quite well.\u201dWrite to Jesse Newman at jesse.newman@wsj.com and Jacob Bunge at jacob.bunge@wsj.comAppeared in the July 31, 2017, print edition as 'Glut of Eggs Shells U.S. Farmers.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cheap-eggs-flood-u-s-grocery-stores-1501239602", "keywords": ["Cal-Maine Foods,CALM,Midwest Poultry Services,Aldi,Post Holdings,POST,Archer Daniels Midland,ADM,Bob Krouse,Brian Moscogiuri,corporate,industrial news,animal health,animal influenza,political,general news,health,commodity markets,agricultural commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,livestock,meat markets,poultry,eggs markets,selection of top stories,trends,analysis,suggested reading   industry news,suggested reading \u2013 food,beverages,tobacco,agriculture,farming,poultry farming,food,retail,wholesale,food retailing,specialty stores,consumer goods,livestock farming"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 06:43:00", "news_title": "The Great Transatlantic Bond Divergence Unwind   ", "content": "Many of the trades embraced by markets after President       Donald Trump\u2019s       election have been slowly unwinding in 2017. Here\u2019s an important one that could have further to go: the gap between U.S. and German government bond yields.The spread between 10-year Treasurys and bunds ballooned after Mr. Trump\u2019s November victory to a level not seen since before the fall of the Berlin Wall, around 2.3 percentage points by the end of 2016. U.S. yields rose sharply on the idea of reflation and stimulus, while Europe appeared stuck in a rut. At 1.75 percentage points, the gap is close to its pre-election level.But even that is unusual by historical standards. Between 1990 and 2014, the spread was only rarely wider than one percentage point, and over that period averaged just 0.2 point, according to data from FactSet.Such a tight relationship between German and U.S. bonds reflected the long global bull market for bonds in the glory years of globalization. Relatively synchronized monetary policy meant yields fell on both sides of the Atlantic together. The Fed\u2019s 2013 taper, followed by signals of coming European Central Bank bond buying helped set the bond markets apart. That both helped weaken the euro and encouraged a rush of bond issuance by U.S. companies in European markets as borrowing costs fell.Where policy goes now is key. Markets doubt how far the Fed might get with its tightening, and seem unflustered by the prospect of the central bank shrinking its balance sheet. Investors may be too relaxed, but in the absence of fiscal stimulus and inflation, much higher yields for Treasurys might be hard to achieve in the near term.The European Central Bank, meanwhile, is set to move out of emergency-policy territory. Support for low yields on German bunds is likely to diminish as the ECB starts to move gently towards an exit from its bond purchases. While policy rates are likely to remain ultra-low for a long time to come, that implies a steeper yield curve in Germany, with the central bank exerting less influence over longer-term interest rates.An important constraint on the ECB\u2019s continuing bond purchases is in Germany; even though the ECB is talking about the flexibility of the program, any tweaks seem unlikely to result in larger purchases of bunds. Meanwhile, the eurozone economy is growing strongly, reducing the allure of German debt as a safe haven; the rise in the euro this year suggests that faith in the currency bloc is recovering. German yields still look out of sync with economic good news such as the record high in the influential Ifo business climate index.The spotlight moves to ECB President       Mario Draghi\u2019s       speech at the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole conference in August. His last appearance there in 2014 foreshadowed eurozone QE, sending the U.S.-German spread wider.

In a 49-51 vote, the Senate rejected a measure to roll back a handful of elements of the law, dubbed the \u201dskinny\u201d repeal, with Republicans John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska siding with Democrats to oppose it. The bill\u2019s failure exposed the difficulty Senate Republicans faced in trying to corral 50 votes for any legislation making changes to the ACA. It also leaves Republicans without any clear next step in their monthslong effort to roll back the ACA and with no significant legislative accomplishment during President Trump\u2019s first months in office.A pickup in global growth and a weakening dollar are boosting profits at many U.S. exporters, helping support the yearslong rally in the stock market and tipping major indexes to new records.

Amazon reported a $197 million second-quarter net profit that was down sharply from a year ago, the WSJ\u2019s Laura Stevens reports, even as sales jumped another 25% to $38 billion. The sales growth is a big contrast with financial reports from the big store-operating retailers, but Amazon also saw the costs of getting those online orders delivered soar. Shipping expenses rose 36% and fulfillment costs jumped 41%, measures that reflect both Amazon\u2019s growing share of the retail market and its drive to control its own logistics and shipping operations. The retailer is plowing its cash back into product development, warehouse building and delivery infrastructure, as well as overseas expansion and video content. The logistics investment will continue as the company gets its fulfillment operation aligned with sales for the fourth quarter holiday rush, when Amazon\u2019s promises of faster delivery times could push the company\u2019s spending on shipping beyond $7 billion.United Parcel Service Inc.       expects retailers to get behind higher shipping prices this fall, and the package carrier\u2019s latest results suggest why UPS is so confident. Revenue in the company\u2019s U.S. domestic business picked up faster than even the strong growth in parcel volumes, the WSJ\u2019s Paul Ziobro reports, signaling UPS is already getting paid more for the extra packages it delivers. Parcel carriers have struggled to turn stronger shipping volumes from online sales into profits, and UPS last month detailed a new add-on fee aimed at the flood of shipments that rises in the period leading up to Christmas. Prices are holding up even without the fees: Average revenue per piece in UPS\u2019s domestic package network rose 3%, and rose slightly more in the ground operations that carry most of the e-commerce shipments. The bottom line was a 9% gain in profit to $1.38 billion, but the 14.3% improvement in domestic operating margin may be more important in the long run.U.S. exporters are riding higher on a weaker dollar. Companies reporting on second-quarter earnings say they are benefiting from growing demand for goods and services by foreign buyers, the WSJ\u2019s Ben Eisen reports, along with expectations for faster global growth with continued low inflation. The dollar edged up on Thursday, but one measure of the dollar against other big currencies shows its value off about 8.6% this year to its lowest level in 13 months.             CSX Corp.      executive Fredrik Eliasson       said the weaker dollar is helping drive some of the resurgent growth in the company\u2019s coal volumes, with more loads heading into export channels. CSX expects to see more outbound flows as the weaker dollar affects more global purchasing decisions. Export volumes at major U.S. ports overall were relatively tepid in June, according to researchers at Panjiva. But South Carolina\u2019s Port of Charleston says growth in its outbound volumes has been accelerating, and jumped 12.9% in June.France\u2019s President       Emmanuel Macron       is providing a stark sign of how important the shipping business is to the government. The administration is temporarily nationalizing the STX France shipyard to stop Italian company             Fincantieri                   SpA from taking majority control of the business, the WSJ\u2019s William Horobin and Giovanni Legorano report, a move the economy minister says will \u201cdefend France\u2019s strategic interests in ship building.\u201d Mr. Macron\u2019s first major industrial move since coming to power in May runs counter to his pro-business campaign rhetoric and highlights the ongoing turmoil in shipbuilding following the historic downturn in recent years in the shipping business. STX Saint-Nazaire was a piece of STX Offshore and Shipbuilding, the South Korean shipyard that recently left receivership with help from the government-run Korea Development Bank. Seoul considers STX a strategic asset, and now France is demonstrating with its move to nationalize the shipyard there that it also doesn\u2019t want to see the local operation\u2019s jobs and work drift away.Amazon is trying to find out if going after a narrow band of higher-spending consumers will make international expansion more profitable. The e-commerce company is moving into Southeast Asia with service in Singapore by initially offering Prime Now, Amazon\u2019s fast-delivery option that offers a smaller selection of goods, the WSJ\u2019s Laura Stevens and Liza Lin report. That will likely put more pressure on the logistics side of the operation at the outset, as the company tries to meet the tight delivery windows that are part of the service. But Amazon expects to learn whether turning its usual market approach upside down provides a better return. Singapore is attractive because of its tight geography, business-friendly environment and affluent population. It also carries logistics challenges, with warehouse space at a premium, that will test just how much Amazon and its customers will pay for fast delivery.Years after placing a big bet on scale in the airline business, Airbus SE                   is backing away from the table. The European jet maker is cutting production of its A380 superjumbo to just eight a year, the WSJ\u2019s Robert Wall reports, bringing nearer to an end the era of big, four-engine long-haul aircraft that have defined aviation\u2019s jet era. Airbus rolled out the double-decker A380 as what the manufacturer would be the next step in bringing economies of scale in the airline industry. But the plane hasn\u2019t caught on in the way ocean carriers have rushed to buy megaships.

The eight years in which short-term interest rates languished at zero may be over for Americans, but returns on deposits are yet to eke out discernible gains.Nor was the Fed\u2019s latest signal that it will start slowly shrinking its asset holdings in the months ahead particularly good news for thrifty households. Shrinking the balance sheet is expected to cause long-term rates to rise, but that is unlikely to boost the returns paid on consumers\u2019 savings products in the short term, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst       Greg McBride.He likened the Fed\u2019s four short-term rate increases since late 2015 to \u201cwater building under the dam,\u201d increasing pressure on banks to boost the rates they pay on deposits. If savers have to wait months for another short-term rate increase, some of that momentum could be lost.The national average for savings accounts is still a puny 0.09%, according to Bankrate.com.The U.S. isn\u2019t even a country with a particularly high saving rate. American households socked away 6% of their disposable income in 2015, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Germans, by contrast, saved 9.7% that year even though the benchmark deposit rate in the eurozone was below zero. The Swiss put away a whopping 19% of their disposable income despite negative rates in Switzerland then, too.Monetary policy makers in the eurozone appear to be the most worried about the plight of savers. Analysis of speeches given by European Central Bank officials show the word \u201csaver\u201d or \u201csavers\u201d was mentioned in 16 speeches over the past year.Federal Reserve policy makers, by contrast, mentioned \u201csaver\u201d or \u201csavers\u201d in 12 speeches, it came up 10 times in Bank of England officials\u2019 remarks, and got just one mention from the Bank of Japan over the past year.But before everyone gets too downbeat about savers\u2019 problems, a speech late last year by Bank of England Gov.       Mark Carney       makes a salient point: \u201cTo a large extent, the thrifty saver and the rich asset holder are often one and the same.\u201d\u201cThe vast majority of savers who might have lost some interest income from lower policy rates have stood to gain from increases in asset prices, particularly the recovery in house prices,\u201d he said.Write to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/torrys-take-for-savers-prioritizing-a-smaller-balance-sheet-isnt-water-under-the-bridge-1501237695", "keywords": ["Federal Reserve,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 06:12:00", "news_title": "Saudi Coalition Says Intercepted Missile Fired at Mecca by Houthi Rebels", "content": "DUBAI\u2014A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition said it shot down a ballistic missile fired at Saudi territory by Houthi rebels in Yemen.The interception occurred late Thursday in Taif province, some 43 miles from Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, the coalition said in a statement published by Saudi Arabia\u2019s official news agency.The missile targeted Mecca, Islam\u2019s holiest city, the coalition said.It aimed to disrupt the hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca that begins at the end of August, it said.The Houthis\u2019 official Saba news agency said the group had fired a number of medium-range Scud-type missiles at Saudi Arabia on Thursday, but that the target was the King Fahad air base in the city of Taif.The missiles hit their targets and caused large losses, Saba\u2019s report said.The Houthis have attacked Saudi Arabian military installations with missiles in the past, and the Saudi coalition has on previous occasions accused the rebels of targeting Mecca.The coalition said in October that it took down another ballistic missile aimed at Mecca, although the Houthis said they were targeting the international airport in Jeddah on Saudi Arabia\u2019s western coast.The attack comes more than two years into a conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis.The U.S.-backed coalition, composed mainly of the Kingdom\u2019s Sunni Muslim allies, wants to unseat the Shiite militant group, which controls Yemen\u2019s capital, San\u2019a, and is backed by Iran, the region\u2019s main Shiite Muslim power.

The Bureau of the Treasury in the Philippines didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Why the interest, given that the flow of money out of China is restricted by capital controls?For starters, the bond sales are largely symbolic. The $148 million raised by Hungary in China is a drop in its planned total gross bond issuance of \u20ac26.2 billion ($30.6 billion) for 2017.Like most countries that raise funds overseas, Hungary plans to repatriate the proceeds of its panda-bond sale. In China that is less of a problem for countries than for companies, according to experts, who say such plans are typically disclosed to regulators before the deal is completedEmerging-market countries, seeking cheap and diversified sources of cash, often issue debt in a number of currencies. China\u2019s bond market is the third-largest in the world, so it makes sense for some countries to try it out, especially as Chinese bonds are eventually expected to be included in major bond indexes. That would bring in index funds and other passive investors.\u201cIf it proves a success, they open up another channel for their government to tap at any time,\u201d said       Sean Chang,        head of Asian debt investment at Baring Asset Management in Hong Kong, who owns Hungarian dim-sum bonds, which are yuan-denominated bonds sold outside of China. \u201cThere is a lot of appetite [for bonds] in the onshore market,\u201d he added.Interest from foreign governments in China\u2019s bond market can be politically motivated too, meant to improve relations with the world\u2019s second-largest economy, according to bankers and investors.China is working to attract foreigners to its bond market. Trading began earlier this month through its bond-connect program, which enables global investors with trading accounts in Hong Kong to access the interbank bond market. Last year China opened its interbank bond market to foreigners with trading accounts in China.\u201cThe Chinese financial market is expanding, and we believe it makes sense for Portugal to participate in the development of this market from its early stages,\u201d a representative of Portugal\u2019s Ministry of Finance said in an email.Foreign companies and governments have been able to tap the panda-bond market since 2005. Chinese authorities broadened access in late 2015, and foreign companies took advantage of that last year.But obstacles remain: \u201cOne of the hurdles that foreign issuers going in face is the uncertainty of execution timing,\u201d said       Agnes Tsang,        a partner at law firm Allen & Overy in Hong Kong, who worked on Poland\u2019s sale of panda bonds last year. \u201cIt takes time for local regulators to review [the deals] and give feedback.\u201dWrite to Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-pandas-are-becoming-popular-in-hungary-1501236408", "keywords": ["china bond market,china debt market,china onshore bonds,dim sum bonds,emerging-market bonds,panda bonds,yuan-denominated bonds,yuan-denominated debt,Portugal's Ministry of Finance,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 06:00:00", "news_title": "J.P.

Morgan plans deals that will both offset its own consumption\u2014its 5,500 properties in more than 60 countries cover 75 million square feet\u2014and provide excess power that can be sold to customers or in markets. In November it signed a deal with a wind farm in Texas that will eventually provide electricity equal to about 75% of J.P. Morgan\u2019s consumption in that state.The 20-year deal, struck with a subsidiary of             NRG Energy Inc.,        NRG -2.01%       will give J.P. Morgan access to the plant that produces 100 megawatts of electricity. The project is expected to come online this year.J.P. Morgan said it expects in coming years to invest $600 million to $700 million in such initiatives.Additionally, the bank is making changes in branches and some corporate buildings, such as installing LED lights in a partnership with             General Electric Co.       and separately adding solar panels to some locations.Daniel Pinto,        head of J.P.

Net interest income was \u20ac8.61 billion compared with \u20ac7.57 billion. Those figures include its acquisition of Banco Popular.The figures were in line with those it had pre-announced early this month when it launched a capital increase to fund its cleanup of Banco Popular, which was beset by souring loans.The acquisition makes Santander Spain\u2019s leading bank in loans and deposits at a time when the country\u2019s economy is resurgent. Economists expect growth to top 3% this year for the third consecutive year, outpacing most major eurozone countries.Santander Executive Chairman Ana Bot\u00edn said that executives are \u201cextremely confident that the acquisition of Popular will deliver a return on investment of 13%-14% by 2019.\u201dSantander\u2019s capital ratio was 9.58% in June compared with 10.66% in March under international regulations known as \u201cfully loaded\u201d Basel III criteria. Santander has among the lowest ratios of major European banks and investors are closely attuned to how it builds its capital.Taking into account Santander\u2019s \u20ac7.07 billion capital increase, which closed Wednesday, its \u201cfully loaded\u201d capital ratio was 10.72% as of June 17, which the bank said keeps it on track to meet its target of above 11% in 2018.Santander\u2019s ratio of bad loans to total loans edged up with the acquisition of Banco Popular to 5.37% in the second quarter from 3.74% in the first quarter. Excluding Banco Popular, that ratio would have fallen to 3.55%. Banco Popular\u2019s balance sheet was weighed down by tens of billions of euros worth of foreclosures, unsold land and other nonperforming assets accumulated when Spain\u2019s real estate boom went bust starting in 2008.Concerns about how Banco Popular was coping with its soured assets, and whether it would be able to find a buyer or raise capital, accelerated into an outright bank run earlier this year. Banco Popular was rescued by Spanish and European Union authorities and sold to Santander for a token \u20ac1 on June 7.Santander executives said Friday they had to inject \u20ac13 billion of liquidity into Banco Popular the day they took it over. Its deposits had fallen by about \u20ac20 billion from December 2016 through June to around \u20ac51 billion, Santander executives told analysts. Since Santander acquired Banco Popular, deposits have increased by more than \u20ac5 billion, they said.Santander is likely to sell 51% of Banco Popular\u2019s real-estate assets, pending regulatory approval, Chief Executive       Jos\u00e9 Antonio \u00c1lvarez       told analysts.\u201cThat is what I see as the central scenario for us,\u201d he said.While Mr. \u00c1lvarez acknowledged that Spain\u2019s real-estate market is recovering, Santander already has enough property assets to capitalize on price increases, he said. After taking on the assets from Banco Popular, Santander has a \u201chigh real estate exposure, which if possible, we want to reduce very quickly,\u201d Mr. \u00c1lvarez said.In Santander\u2019s Brazil unit, net profit rose strongly year-over-year in the second quarter.

As such, Mr. Xi\u2019s speech, which was widely publicized by state media, offers a window into his priorities for the next few years.Beyond tightened control of the party, Mr. Xi committed to sustaining \u201csupply-side economic reforms\u201d\u2014a broad program to slash industrial overcapacity and debt that are pressuring an economy whose growth has slowed markedly since he took power in late 2012.Mr. Xi appears all but assured of securing a second five-year term as party leader at the coming congress, expected later this year though specific dates have yet to be announced. During his time in office, Mr. Xi has consolidated his authority much more rapidly than his predecessors, using the anticorruption drive to shake up the party, reorganizing the military and playing a more dynamic role in world affairs.The president is looking to the congress to reinforce his authority by packing allies into top leadership bodies, sidelining rivals and, according to some party insiders, avoiding the elevation of a potential successor. In July, the party removed a senior official once seen as a candidate for top office, placing him under investigation for suspected \u201cserious disciplinary violations\u201d and appointing an ally of Mr. Xi\u2019s to the official\u2019s former post.By emphasizing the need for \u201cstrengthening party governance\u201d in his speech, Mr. Xi is signaling his intention to further centralize power and \u201cdemand that party officials show loyalty to his agenda,\u201d said       Wu Qiang,        a current-affairs commentator and former politics lecturer at Beijing\u2019s Tsinghua University.The president Thursday hailed what he called \u201chistoric changes\u201d over the past five years, which have led to China entering a \u201cnew development stage\u201d while offering \u201cChinese wisdom\u201d and \u201cChinese solutions\u201d for dealing with global problems. Though his published remarks didn\u2019t specify those problems, Mr. Xi in the past has mentioned economic development and climate change, among other issues.As China\u2019s leader, Mr. Xi has sought to revitalize the 89-million-member ruling party with stern discipline and a sense of nationalistic purpose. His goal is to forge a more-agile government that can tackle China\u2019s economic challenges and the growing demands of a more prosperous population, analysts have said.Along the way, Mr. Xi has also used his disciplinary campaigns to neutralize rivals and demand loyalty. His detractors have said he is eroding China\u2019s collective leadership, in place for decades, as he focuses on political goals rather than economic restructuring.Officials have blamed resistance to Mr. Xi\u2019s agenda on corrupt, feet-dragging bureaucrats trying to protect vested interests.A state-media publicity blitz has been busy extolling Mr. Xi\u2019s record. In the run-up to Thursday\u2019s speech, China Central Television aired a 10-episode series titled \u201cCarrying Out Reforms Through to the End,\u201d a review of his policies over the past five years.Some observers said Mr. Xi\u2019s speech, as well as the surrounding fanfare, telegraphs plans for the party to honor him as a great socialist thinker at the coming congress\u2014elevating his stature to that of revolutionary leader Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, the late reformist leader.Mr. Xi, in his remarks, said the party should produce \u201ca new summation\u201d of socialist theories suited for the next stage of China\u2019s development.A newspaper run by the elite Central Party School published a commentary Friday praising Mr. Xi as a compassionate leader who has offered fresh ideas on governance.\u201cWhat new breakthroughs in the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s theoretical work will emerge at the 19th party congress?\u201d said a posting on the             WeChat                   social-media account Xiakedao, which is run by People\u2019s Daily, the party\u2019s flagship newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s worth looking forward to.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   A newspaper run by the elite Central Party School published a commentary Friday praising Mr. Xi as a compassionate leader who has offered fresh ideas on governance.

The 18-year-old recent high-school grad and her mother, Kimberly, 47, who is also a fan, ended up buying regular weekend passes instead, at around $100 each. Clad in costumes based on Rooster Teeth characters, they flew to Texas earlier this month from their home in Milan, Ind., for the packed gathering.High-profile events like Comic-Con International and Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, have for years attracted upward of 100,000 fans to a range of comic and film franchises. Now, niche entertainment businesses are getting into the convention trade.Once sequestered to YouTube and other web spaces, online entertainers like Rooster Teeth are breaking into new sources of revenue, and events, which can draw tens of thousands of loyal fans, are becoming a key component of their growing franchises.Longtime web comic Penny Arcade, for example, has spun its original business into new series, a merchandise line and its own gaming convention, Penny Arcade Expo. Podcast network Maximum Fun hosts its convention, MaxFunCon, at least twice a year on the East and West coasts.Rooster Teeth won a loyal following with online videos in which people play videogames in front of audiences, with witty banter that evokes improv comedy and British game shows. Its personality-driven content has spawned a universe of microbrands, including podcasts, live-action shows, animated series, videogames and even a feature film, \u201cLazer Team\u201d (2015).Kaitlin Mattis, a 20-year-old student at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire who flew to Austin in early July to work as a volunteer at RTX, said she often turns to Rooster Teeth after a long day.\u201cJust listening to them laugh and talk about how much their audience means to them and how they love the content they make\u2026it fills a void. It makes you feel like one of them. It makes you feel like family,\u201d Ms. Mattis said of Rooster Teeth\u2019s gaming videos and podcasts. \u201cWhen I watch a Tom Hanks movie, I don\u2019t feel like Tom Hanks and I are best buds.\u201dMs. Mattis, Ms. Bowling and her mother were among 62,000 Rooster Teeth fans who descended on the Austin Convention Center earlier this month for the seventh RTX Austin, the largest yet.Most of the company\u2019s material is available free on its website and YouTube, but superfans\u2014200,000 of them, according to the company\u2014pay up to $35 a month to watch new material before anyone else, among other perks. On YouTube, the company boasts about 38 million subscribers across its network of channels.The company\u2019s first RTX in 2011 drew 600 people. By the next year, 4,500 people came to the event, which moved into the Austin Convention Center to accommodate the larger crowd. Last year, Rooster Teeth expanded the franchise to Sydney, Australia, where 11,500 attended, the company said. A sold-out London event is set to draw 15,000 attendees this October.\u201cWe saw that there was so much pent-up demand,\u201d said       Matt Hullum,        co-founder and chief executive of Rooster Teeth. \u201cWe very quickly realized this is something we need to take seriously as a business and grow.\u201dRooster Teeth was born in 2003 when Mr. Hullum and four friends started making an animated series about gaming in a spare bedroom in Austin. \u201cRed vs. Blue,\u201d a comedic spinoff of hit videogame \u201cHalo,\u201d garnered nearly 1 million downloads for four episodes by the end of its first month.\u201cAfter that first month, we got stuck with a $13,000 bill for hosting [the website] and knew we had to find a way to make money or the show wasn\u2019t going to survive,\u201d said Burnie Burns, co-founder and chief creative officer.Rooster Teeth was acquired in 2014 for an undisclosed sum by Fullscreen Inc., which manages and markets YouTube content creators and is now owned by a joint venture between             AT&T Inc.       and the Chernin Group.Peter Chernin,        the veteran Hollywood executive and producer behind the Chernin Group, said Rooster Teeth was already profitable when Fullscreen acquired it, thanks in large part to advertising revenue from YouTube.Today, as Rooster Teeth continues to branch out, advertising makes up 31% of the company\u2019s revenue. Less than half of that comes from YouTube ads; the rest comes from sponsorship relationships.One-fifth of revenue comes from sales of merchandise. Its online store features more than 3,000 products including T-shirts, pillows, posters and figurines with the company\u2019s show characters, staffers and inside jokes from its videos. Last year, Rooster Teeth sold 250,000 T-shirts, the company said. It declined to disclose exact revenue figures.At this year\u2019s RTX, the exhibit hall teemed with fans shopping for memorabilia, playing videogames and mingling between events including live podcasts, panel discussions on Rooster Teeth shows and \u201clet\u2019s play\u201d performances where show stars trade playful barbs and raunchy jokes while playing videogames in front of a boisterous crowd.Amaury Navarro,        a 26-year-old marketer, said he became a Rooster Teeth fan after watching \u201cRed vs. Blue\u201d in 2003. He now has a 10-year DVD box set for the show as well as Rooster Teeth-branded shirts, a blanket, beanie, socks, jersey and an adult-size onesie. Mr. Navarro met his girlfriend at the first RTX convention he attended, in 2013. He hasn\u2019t missed one since.\u201cIf you cut me open, I\u2019m going to bleed orange and black like the \u2018Funhaus\u2019 colors, or green and black like \u2018Achievement Hunter\u2019 colors,\u201d Mr. Navarro said, referring Rooster Teeth\u2019s gaming channels.Such loyalty among millennials distinguishes Rooster Teeth from most traditional television shows and legacy entertainment, said Mr. Chernin.For many, events like RTX provide a venue to find like-minded people. \u201cEverywhere you go, you can make a new friend,\u201d Ms. Bowling said, standing in the lobby of Austin Convention Center. \u201cLast year, I made friends just by waiting in line for a panel\u2026. This year, I have an entire group to meet up and hang out with already.\u201dBut she wasn\u2019t waiting in the long lines this time around. When Ms. Bowling arrived in Austin, she ran into a friend who gave her extra VIP passes he had from friends who couldn\u2019t make the convention.\u201cThis is a Holy Grail,\u201d Ms. Bowling said. \u201cI\u2019m going to cherish it for a long time.\u201d She has already started saving to make another pilgrimage next year.\u2014Ben Fritz contributed to this article.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-entertainment-companies-discover-the-pros-of-cons-1501234204", "keywords": ["burnie burns,comic-con,cons,cosplay,e3,fullscreen,matt hullum,maxfuncon,maximum fun ,penny arcade,penny arcade expo,peter chernin,red vs. blue,rooster teeth,rtx, the chernin group,Fullscreen,Peter Chernin,Amaury Navarro,Ashley Bowling,Matt Hullum,conferences,exhibitions,corporate,industrial news,games,political,general news,arts,entertainment,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,dolls,toys,video game consoles,conventions,trade shows,advertising,marketing,public relations,business,consumer services,consumer goods,computing,durable household products,games software,home electronics,appliances,leisure,travel goods,media,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 05:30:00", "news_title": "War-Torn Syria\u2019s Battered Economy Marked by Inflation and Poverty", "content": "After the Syrian government recently introduced a 2,000-pound bank note\u2014the largest denomination it has ever issued\u2014a satirical obituary circulated online for a currency that has lost 90% of its value over more than six years of war.\u201cThe Central Bank of Syria is accepting condolences,\u201d it announced.The introduction of the note, worth less than $4, comes as Syria\u2019s economy is in tatters, grappling with wartime inflation, lost production and widespread poverty that could threaten stability even in regime-held areas.Syria\u2019s consumer-price index soared more than 500% between 2010 and 2016, according to Syrian economists and local news reports that cited the Syrian government\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics.Incomes haven\u2019t kept pace. The average civil servant\u2019s salary was worth at least $200 a month before the conflict; now, even with raises, it is only worth less than $60, because of the falling currency.The World Bank estimates that Syria\u2019s gross domestic product has fallen by more than half this decade.The sharp fall in economic activity has cost at least two million people their jobs and about 60% of Syrians are unable to buy food and essential nonfood items, according to the Bank.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a pretty nightmarish economic situation for a long time to come,\u201d said       David Butter,        an economic analyst at U.K.-based think tank Chatham House.Syria has been divided, in effect, by the fighting. The Syrian regime of President       Bashar al-Assad,        antigovernment rebels, U.S.-backed Kurds and the militant group Islamic State all control parts of the country.But the faltering economy spans those areas, and the war has altered consumer behavior.

Over all, the study found that about 20% of taxpayers would owe more after tax reform than before it.The issue of\u00a0tax reform\u2019s\u00a0winners and losers\u00a0has resurfaced after top congressional Republicans and the Trump administration released a set of broad principles for tax policy\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0containing few details.In an\u00a0interview with The Wall Street Journal this week, Mr. Trump affirmed that a major overhaul could bring \u201cupward revisions\u201d that raise taxes for some people.\u00a0He also struck a new tone, stating\u00a0that he doesn\u2019t like it that a \u201crich guy who made\u2026$25 million last year is going to pay less\u201d after tax reform than before.But based on his proposals and statements,\u00a0that is exactly what would happen.It\u2019s important to note that the one-page tax proposal released by the White House in April\u00a0omitted many important details. And\u00a0the Big Six, a small group of Republican law- and policy makers now working on an overhaul plan, are meeting in secret.A final deal, if any, could include many changes. But the Tax Policy\u2019s\u00a0Center\u2019s\u00a0estimates provide a useful marker in the interim.\u201cThe broad conclusions are likely to be stable because they are based on the tax cuts Trump has promised,\u201d\u00a0says       Joe Rosenberg,        an economist with the Tax Policy Center.The study assumed a tax plan that loses revenue overall but has tax increases to stem losses. The provisions that would hurt revenue include changing individual income-tax rates to 10%, 25% and 35%; doubling the \u201cstandard deduction\u201d; repealing the alternative minimum tax; reducing to 15% the tax rate on corporate income and business income of \u201cpass-through\u201d entities such as partnerships; and repealing the estate tax.The provisions that would boost revenue include repealing \u201citemized\u201d deductions other than for charitable giving and mortgage interest; repealing personal exemptions; repealing the head-of-household filing status; taxing payouts of large pass-through entities as dividends; and taxing capital gains at death above an exemption of $5 million a person.The effects of these changes aren\u2019t constant across income tiers, so the percentage of tax reform\u2019s net losers varies greatly among people with different incomes.The affluent are at the greatest risk of owing more for several reasons. Compared with the working poor, they have more ability to pay higher taxes. Compared with the highest earners, they often derive a large chunk of their tax benefits from a host of deductions and exclusions that could be cut back.The highest earners are more likely to reap additional benefits from favorable rates on investment income, such as long-term capital gains, than the affluent are. Unlike in the 1986 tax reform, which raised rates on capital gains, there are no current plans to do that this time. The highest earners also stand to gain greatly from provisions taxing business income at lower rates.The Tax Policy Center didn\u2019t break out which changes would contribute most to tax increases for the affluent. But it\u2019s a good bet that a big one is eliminating deductions for state and local taxes. These write-offs currently cost Uncle Sam $103 billion a year, far more than the mortgage-interest deductions at $64 billion and charitable deductions at $61 billion.Loss of the state and local tax deduction could raise taxes for many even if the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, is repealed, according to a different study by Tax Policy Center economist       Frank Sammartino.This result might seem surprising because currently the AMT curtails the benefit of deducting state and local taxes for taxpayers who owe AMT. Because of complex interactions in the two provisions, however, about three-quarters of those who owe AMT and also deduct state and local taxes would see a net tax increase if both provisions are repealed.In this case, the affluent taxpayers at risk of owing more after an overhaul are especially likely to live in high-tax states such as California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.With luck, we\u2019ll learn more about the actual plan soon\u2014and\u00a0see if the losers have changed.Write to Laura Saunders at laura.saunders@wsj.comAppeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'The Winners and Losers of a Tax Overhaul.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bad-news-if-you-make-150-000-to-300-000-higher-taxes-for-many-1501234200", "keywords": [" alternative minimum tax , big six, capital gains, donald trump, tax increase, tax policy center,tax reform,tax report, tax revenue, trump tax plan,Frank Sammartino,Joe Rosenberg,government finance,government budget,taxation,direct taxation,alternative minimum tax,economic news,income tax,political,general news,personal finance,tax strategies,advice"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 05:30:00", "news_title": "Buyout Firm Blames China-Bashing for Stalled Semiconductor Deal ", "content": "A China-backed firm whose deal to buy an American semiconductor company has stalled before a U.S. government panel is taking the unusual step of going public with its frustrations, saying China-bashing in the U.S. is holding up the acquisition.Principals with Canyon Bridge Capital Partners Inc. said their interest in Portland, Ore.-based             Lattice Semiconductor Corp.        LSCC 1.02%       is purely commercial and that they have tried to address the national-security concerns of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Still, nine months after Canyon Bridge said it first approached the panel, the $1.3 billion deal remains stuck, a delay the partners said is chiefly political.Since the presidential campaign, \u201cthe concerns about all things China has been put under a very harsh light and emphasized in a very unfortunate way,\u201d Canyon Bridge partner       Ray Bingham       said in an interview. He said politics \u201cmore than anything\u201d accounted for the scrutiny the deal is facing.Mr. Bingham\u2019s willingness and that of his fellow partners to talk about their deal\u2019s troubled review is unusual. Companies rarely discuss dealings with CFIUS, the secretive multiagency committee that screens foreign investments for national security risks.The Canyon Bridge-Lattice tie-up has been a lightning rod in an intensifying struggle between the U.S. and China over semiconductors\u2014the chip technology that powers computers, mobile phones and much military hardware.Washington grew very wary last year following repeated attempts by Chinese companies to buy U.S. semiconductor makers. Canyon Bridge\u2019s structure\u2014a Palo Alto, Calif.-registered private-equity firm funded by the Chinese government\u2014raised red flags among members of Congress. Then came the presidential campaign when       Donald Trump       portrayed China as a trading predator, further souring the atmosphere for Chinese deals, which have been facing more scrutiny from CFIUS in recent months.Canyon Bridge is now on its third attempt to get approval from CFIUS, after twice failing to win it within the review period, each roughly 2\u00bd months long. The committee is led by the Treasury Department and includes representatives from the Defense, State, Justice and Commerce departments, among others.\u201cProtecting our national security is the primary focus of CFIUS, and we take that responsibility very seriously,\u201d a Treasury spokesman said.Canyon Bridge managing partner Ben Chow said he and his partners were always transparent with CFIUS about the source of their funding, which he said is 99% from China Reform Holdings Corp., a state-owned investment company funded by China\u2019s national government.\u201cWe have never hidden anything,\u201d Mr. Chow said in the interview.Lattice Chief Executive       Darin Billerbeck       said in a separate interview that the companies have offered to tighten safeguards on intellectual property to prevent it from being transferred to China and that in an initial meeting with CFIUS, the panel \u201cgave zero indication\u201d of any problems. \u201cThey said, \u2018Looking at the data you\u2019re presenting, that shouldn\u2019t be a big deal,\u2019\u201d he said.CFIUS has since communicated to the companies that it doesn\u2019t intend to grant approval due to what it said were unresolved national-security concerns, according to people familiar with the matter. After the latest setback, the companies considered taking the deal directly to Mr. Trump, these people said. It would have been a risky move given that presidents typically accept the recommendations of CFIUS, and such a high-level rejection could have damaged other deal prospects. The deal makers ultimately decided to withdraw and refile their application again in June.Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said Canyon Bridge\u2019s decision to go public would likely benefit Beijing even if the deal fails.\u201cThis could be a win-win for the Chinese government,\u201d said Mr. Scissors. If the strategy helps the deal gain approval, China gets a semiconductor company. If it fails, he said, the deal becomes a talking point for Beijing in a fraught U.S.-China trade relationship.\u201cIf they get turned down, it\u2019s something the Chinese could bring up again and again and again,\u201d said Mr. Scissors. \u201cGet ready to hear about Lattice and Canyon Bridge for the next three years. They\u2019ll be pounding it into the ground.\u201dScrutiny of China\u2019s chip ambitions in the U.S. gathered steam last year. In December, following an investigation by CFIUS, then-President       Barack Obama       blocked a Chinese investment fund\u2019s purchase of German semiconductor-equipment supplier             Aixtron SE,       which has a factory and other offices in the U.S. In January, an Obama administration advisory panel published a report warning of the economic and military dangers posed by China\u2019s 10-year, $150 billion effort to build a cutting-edge semiconductor sector. The report called for policies to ensure the U.S. remains a global leader in semiconductors.A bipartisan group of 22 House lawmakers led by Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.) wrote to CFIUS in December to flag the Lattice deal, expressing concern that it could provide China with critical military technology and accusing Canyon Bridge of initially trying to obscure its Chinese government backing.Lattice sold its military design unit in 2012, the same year the Federal Bureau of Investigation charged two Chinese residents for conspiring to acquire military-grade chips from the company. Lattice says it now solely makes civilian-use chips\u2014largely for consumer electronics\u2014which lack heat shields and other features needed for military use.Mr. Billerbeck remained optimistic about Mr. Trump\u2019s openness to the deal, which he could technically approve over any CFIUS objection. \u201cI know that President Trump is a really intelligent businessman,\u201d Mr. Billerbeck said. \u201cI know that if you had 10 minutes to explain this deal to him, he would say it\u2019s a good deal.\u201dWrite to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/buyout-firm-blames-china-bashing-for-stalled-semiconductor-deal-1501234202", "keywords": ["cfius,china trade,national security,pe deals,semiconductors,trump china,u.s. china trade,Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S,Canyon Bridge Capital Partners,Lattice Semiconductor,LSCC,U.S. government,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,financial services,industrial electronics,industrial goods,investing,securities,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 05:30:00", "news_title": "Venezuela to Hold a Vote Many \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tDon\u2019t Want, Others Don\u2019t Understand", "content": "RIO CHICO, Venezuela\u2014Most Venezuelans have told pollsters they don\u2019t want a new constitution.

But it\u2019s not clear that any bill can move forward fast enough to affect the markets for next year, as insurers must file rates by mid-August and make final decisions about participation by late September.\u201cWe really are right now up against it, as far as the deadline is concerned,\u201d said       Gary Cohen,        a vice president at Blue Shield of California. Even if lawmakers from both parties work to pull together a bill to bolster the exchanges, \u201cmy concern is that for 2018, it\u2019s going to be too late.\u201dCapital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.The industry had opposed the Senate bill voted down early Friday partly because it would kill the ACA\u2019s requirement for individuals to have insurance, which they say is important in prodding young, healthy enrollees into the markets. However, many companies have said that even if Congress never formally repeals the coverage mandate, they fear the       Trump       administration won\u2019t strongly enforce it\u2014or consumers will ignore it, figuring that it will likely be toothless.President Donald Trump likely added to the industry\u2019s alarm with a Friday-morning tweet in which he wrote: \u201cAs I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!\u201dInsurers have been equally focused on other policy moves that they say are vital to propping up the exchanges. Most urgently, they want a guarantee that the federal government will continue making payments that reduce out-of-pocket costs for low-income ACA enrollees. Without those payments, insurers\u00a0say that premiums will be far higher, and more companies may simply pull out of the exchanges. The industry also wants new funding aimed at blunting the cost of covering the sickest consumers.With their ideas getting little traction so far in Congress, insurers have been issuing increasingly-public warnings about the consequences of inaction.Late Thursday, before the Senate vote,       Daniel\u00a0J.\u00a0Hilferty,        chief executive of Independence Blue Cross, said the insurer is now \u201cfor the first time, asking, if the [cost-sharing funds] aren\u2019t paid and the individual mandate isn\u2019t enforced, are we going to be in the markets.\u201d Independence is the only exchange insurer in the Philadelphia area and Mr. Hilferty is a prominent voice in the industry, serving as chairman of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.The company hasn\u2019t made a final decision, but it would \u201cstrongly consider not participating\u201d in the exchanges without the cost-sharing payments and enforcement of the mandate, he said. \u201cIt just really begs the question, is this marketplace sustainable.\u201d Independence has asked for a rate increase of around 8.5% on average for next year for its Pennsylvania marketplace plans, and the loss of the cost-sharing payments would add about 4.5 percentage points to that, while lack of enforcement of the mandate would add another 17 percentage points, he said.Anthem\u00a0Inc.      , which has around 1.5 million ACA-plan enrollees,\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0during a call with analysts that if it doesn\u2019t quickly get more certainty about the future of the exchanges, it will likely further pull back its planned participation for next year. Chief Executive\u00a0Joseph R. Swedish\u00a0said that without greater clarity, particularly around the cost-sharing payments, \u201cwe will need to revise our rate filings to further narrow our level of participation.\u201d He added that the\u00a0insurer\u00a0may make decisions \u201cin a relatively short period of time\u201d and in September at the latest.Anthem, which has already disclosed plans to leave three of the 14 state exchanges where it offers plans, also said that if the cost-sharing payments are killed, it will need to seek rate increases of around 18% to 20% on exchange plans. The\u00a0insurer\u00a0said those increases would come on top of significant hikes it is already requesting, which it said were 20% or more.A number of insurers, including Anthem, have already cited uncertainty around the future of the marketplaces as a major factor in already-announced decisions to pull back or exit exchanges in 2018. Such moves have left an estimated 38 counties in Nevada, Indiana and Ohio at risk of having no exchange insurers next year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.Among insurers so far planning to remain in the exchanges, many already assumed in their 2018 rate requests that the cost-sharing payments won\u2019t be locked in, and the mandate may not be enforced. Oliver Wyman, a consulting\u00a0unit of             Marsh & McLennan,       has projected that premiums might be roughly 9% higher on average if the mandate weren\u2019t enforced, while the loss of the cost-sharing payments might mean an 11% to 20% boost.In some rate filings that have already become public,\u00a0insurers\u00a0offered different estimates. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina said that of its 22.9% proposed increase for 2018, 14.1 percentage points were from assumed loss of the cost-sharing payments. BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee said that of its 21% boost, about 14 percentage points were tied to the lack of cost-sharing payments and 7 percentage points to the loss of enforcement of the mandate.Insurers\u00a0say the worry is that such significant rate increases might create a cascading dynamic, as more healthy people leave the market, pushing rates up even more in the future for the shrinking pool of increasingly unhealthy enrollees. Actuaries say this effect might be blunted by the ACA\u2019s premium subsidies, since those protect many consumers from bearing the full brunt of rate increases.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurers-relieved-as-skinny-health-bill-fails-but-warn-of-rising-rates-exits-from-exchanges-1501231683", "keywords": ["Blue Shield of California,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 04:36:00", "news_title": "Barclays Pushed to Loss by Africa Write-Down", "content": "LONDON\u2014            Barclays        BCS -1.02%       PLC on Friday said it swung to a second-quarter net loss as it took a hit on the disposal of its Africa operations and higher provisions for conduct costs.Overall the bank\u2019s results were mixed. Revenue fell on the back of muted trading at its investment bank and lower sales at its retail operations. But the investment bank performed better than some analysts had expected.Impairments increased at its credit-card division and the bank took a \u00a3700 million charge to compensate customers who were sold insurance products they didn\u2019t need.

The quarter \u201cessentially closed the restructuring of Barclays,\u201d he said.The bank has completed a retreat from Africa, retrenched its investment bank and closed its noncore division, which held billions of unwanted assets.However, shares have fallen in the last three months as investors fret whether the new-look Barclays can produce returns. Dividend rises are still over the horizon, although the bank said it would update investors at its full-year results in February. It said Friday it is now targeting a greater than 10% group return on tangible equity \u201cover time.\u201d The group\u2019s second-quarter tangible equity was minus 11%.The British bank said total income came in at \u00a35 billion for the quarter, compared with \u00a35.97 billion a year ago. Excluding one-offs, profit before tax was \u00a3659 million, which was below analysts expectations. Shares inched up 0.6% in morning trading.Over the past year, the focus has been shoring up Barclays\u2019s balance sheet. Cutting its stake in its Africa division has helped push the bank\u2019s capital ratio up to 13.1%. Now the bank is focusing on becoming more efficient, Mr. Staley said. The lender hopes \u00a31 billion of costs will fall away in the next two years.Barclays\u2019s closely watched investment bank reported another fall in revenue, with its macro-trading division suffering another poor quarter as sales fell heavily. However, sales at its bond-trading and equities-trading divisions rose.Analysts at Jefferies said returns at the investment bank were \u201creasonable given peers\u2019 performance.\u201d Barclays is reallocating capital within that division from its corporate loan book to its markets business, in particular its prime-brokerage division.A series of regulatory issues still hang over the bank.

The bill\u2019s failure exposed the difficulty Senate Republicans faced in trying to corral 50 votes for any legislation making changes to the ACA, whether modest or major.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.Friday\u2019s vote leaves Republicans without any clear next step in their monthslong effort to roll back the ACA and with no significant legislative accomplishment during President       Donald Trump\u2019s       first seven months in office.\u201cThis is clearly a disappointing moment,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said on the Senate floor moments after the vote. \u201cI regret that our efforts were simply not enough this time.\u201dDays earlier,       Mr. McConnell       had pulled off a come-from-behind victory to begin debate on the bill, boosted by Mr. McCain\u2019s return from Arizona after recently being diagnosed with brain cancer. But Mr. McCain\u2019s defection Friday morning helped bring down the bill, despite an intense lobbying effort to win him over by GOP leaders.\u201cOne of the major failures of Obamacare was that it was rammed through Congress by Democrats on a strict-party line basis without a single Republican vote. We should not make the mistakes of the past,\u201d Mr. McCain said in a statement after the vote, urging GOP leaders to hold hearings and solicit Democratic ideas.The defeat left Senate Republicans with little to show for their weeks of difficult deliberations. Although the House overcame a setback to pass a sweeping health-care overhaul in May, the Senate GOP\u2019s narrow majority and deep internal divisions made such a comeback difficult.Mr. McConnell said after the vote that it was now Democrats\u2019 turn to propose fixes to the ACA. \u201cIt\u2019s time for our friends on the other side to tell us what they have in mind and we\u2019ll see how the American people feel about their ideas,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Democrats were ready to work with Republicans to shore up the health-care law. \u201cObamacare was hardly perfect. It did a lot of good things, but it needs improvement,\u201d       Mr. Schumer       said.President Donald Trump, who\u2019d exhorted Republicans to pass a bill in recent days, tweeted after the vote, \u201c3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let Obamacare implode, then deal. Watch!\u201dMr. Trump has often mulled letting fragile insurance markets collapse, but some members of his own party, who represent states where markets have had trouble, oppose this approach. Democrats, meanwhile, have accused Mr. Trump\u2019s administration of undermining the ACA and its exchanges.After weeks of internal debate over how to dismantle and replace the health-care law, often called Obamacare, Senate Republicans had settled on a stripped-down plan to pare back pieces of it, after a series of broader proposals failed earlier this week to secure the 50 votes needed to pass.But support even for the bare-bones measure foundered Thursday, when Senate Republicans became nervous that the House would take the bill up and pass it, rather than using it to start fresh negotiations between the two chambers.\u201cThe skinny bill as policy is a disaster. The skinny bill as a replacement for Obamacare is a fraud,\u201d Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) said Thursday evening. \u201cNot only do we not replace Obamacare, we politically own the collapse of health care.\u201dHouse Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.) responded late Thursday with a cautious statement saying the House would be willing to negotiate, and he spoke later over the phone to a handful of concerned senators, including Mr. Graham, who ended up voting for the bill.\u201cIf moving forward requires a conference committee, that is something the House is willing to do,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a statement signaling frustration with the Senate Republicans\u2019 difficulty in coalescing around a health bill.The \u201cskinny\u201d repeal would have undone the ACA\u2019s requirement that most people purchase health insurance or pay a penalty, and it would have suspended enforcement through 2025 of a related requirement that most employers offer coverage. An unpopular tax on medical devices would have been delayed through 2020, and funding would also be rescinded for a $1 billion public-health program run through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The bill also attempted to expand the use of ACA state waivers to get rid of some insurance regulations, such as a requirement that health plans cover mental-health services and maternity care, though lawmakers are limited by budget rules in how much flexibility they can write into the legislation. Republicans blame the ACA\u2019s regulations for inflating the cost of insurance premiums, while Democrat say they provide needed protections to consumers.A Congressional Budget Office estimate released late Thursday said the bill could result in 16 million more people losing insurance in a decade and premiums rising roughly 20%.Health and Human Services Secretary       Tom Price,        said after the vote that he would continue his agency\u2019s steps to relax the ACA\u2019s regulations, citing an executive order signed by the president that called for using the maximum discretion that the law allowed.\u201cSince day one of the Trump administration, the team at HHS has taken numerous steps to provide relief to Americans who are reeling from the status quo, and this effort will continue,\u201d his statement said.Democrats criticized the GOP legislative process that led to a bill unveiled only hours before the unsuccessful vote.\u201cThis is nuclear-grade bonkers what is happening here tonight,\u201d said Sen.       Chris Murphy       (D., Conn.). \u201cWhen you get rid of the mandate, every single insurance company will tell you that rates skyrocket because you\u2019re not getting rid of the provision that requires insurance companies to price sick people the same as healthy people.\u201dHealth insurers warned this week of the danger of ending the requirement that individuals buy insurance. If younger, healthier people aren\u2019t prodded to buy insurance, offsetting the costs of less-well individuals, costs would rise and premiums would jump, they fear.On Thursday morning, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry\u2019s largest trade group, sent a letter to Mr. McConnell opposing skinny repeal.Lawmakers will now likely be under pressure to take steps to shore up the individual market, where people can buy insurance if they don\u2019t get it through work or the government.\u2014Louise Radnofsky and       Natalie Andrews       contributed to this articleWrite to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com, Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/skinny-repeal-of-obamacare-fails-in-senate-1501220543", "keywords": [" aca, gop senate, health freedom act, health mandate,obamacare,republicans,Paul Ryan,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,health care policy,political,general news,society,community,health,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid,private health insurance"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 03:11:00", "news_title": "Rising Ticket Prices Help British Airways Parent Fly High ", "content": "LONDON\u2014            British Airways        ICAGY -2.41%       parent company International Consolidated Airlines Group SA said second-quarter net profit surged 20%, with the carrier benefiting from rising ticket prices, in common with its European and U.S. rivals.Net profit rose to \u20ac540 million ($631 million) from \u20ac450 million in the second quarter of 2016.

Yet it still needs to attract more eyeballs.Baidu in the second quarter delivered its best quarterly revenue ever, with a 14% increase. Its net profit in turn jumped 83% thanks to less spending on marketing. That is a welcome turnaround from last year, when the company\u2019s advertising revenue was badly hit following the death of a student after using alternative treatments found on the search engine. The results were a relief for shareholders: Baidu\u2019s Nasdaq-listed shares rose 5% in after-hours trading.Yet the anemic growth in Baidu\u2019s core advertising revenue, which rose just 5.6%, indicates it hasn\u2019t solved its deeper problem: People just aren\u2019t spending much time on its apps, which provide things like search, news and video. The company\u2019s revenue growth still pales in comparison to that of its two biggest domestic rivals, Alibaba and Tencent, which are both expected to report more than 40% growth in revenue for the June quarter, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.Their relative success reflects the fact that mobile users spend most of their time on social media and games, areas both dominated by Tencent in China. Meanwhile Alibaba reigns supreme in e-commerce, which accounts for the lion\u2019s share of mobile advertising.The more time people spend on Alibaba or Tencent apps, the more data those companies can gather on user behavior, helping them to show more relevant ads and charge advertisers more in turn.

Many protesters traveled from neighboring provinces to gather at the location near the heart of Beijing, where police are typically expected to quickly quash any signs of social unrest.Security in the capital has been tightened in recent weeks as China prepares to host a sensitive congress of the ruling Communist Party later this year.Beijing\u2019s public security department said on its Weibo social media account late Wednesday that the protest was an \u201cillegal gathering\u201d incited by group members. The post said police released those who showed remorse after \u201cre-education,\u201d but would take harsh measures against others suspected of incitement.Chinese authorities have struggled for decades to contain the proliferation of pyramid and Ponzi schemes and other types of fraud conducted on a large scale. Similar to a pyramid scheme, a Ponzi scheme is an operation that pays returns to early investors using money obtained from later ones, typically leading to its collapse.The growth of such fraudulent operations has only accelerated in recent years with the spread of mobile banking and social-media platforms that can quickly pull in elderly or less-educated investors.\u201cKindness Exchange\u201d was set up in May 2013 and advertised itself as a campaign against social inequality, according to state media reports.Members who characterized themselves as \u201cpoor\u201d and contributed 3,000 yuan ($445) would get returns of as high as 50% after only one month, while \u201crich\u201d members who gave 50,000 yuan ($7,400) would receive returns of 10%, graphics from its now-defunct website showed.In another well-known case, the government has described Ezubao, a peer-to-peer lending platform based in central China that was shut down in late 2015, as having run a massive Ponzi scheme.

CEA -0.70%      , strengthened their partnership through a series of share transactions, amid mounting competition on lucrative international routes.Delta said Thursday that it intends to buy a 10% stake in Air France for \u20ac375 million euros, about $437 million, as the longtime partners aim to strengthen their position on the lucrative trans-Atlantic market. China Eastern, a Delta partner in China, intends to buy 10% of Air France. The two carriers will spend a total of \u20ac751 million to acquire the stakes in Air France.Delta said the expanded joint venture will offer nearly 300 daily nonstop trans-Atlantic flights.Air France said it also will acquire a 31% stake in Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. for \u00a3220 million ($287.5 million) from majority owner       Richard Branson\u2019s       Virgin Group Holdings Ltd. Delta already owns 49% of the niche long-haul carrier. The three carriers\u2014Delta, Air France and Virgin Atlantic\u2014intend to create a global joint venture. Each transaction is subject to shareholder, board and regulatory approvals.After the transaction, Air France would become the second-largest shareholder in Virgin Atlantic behind Delta. The French government\u2019s stake in Air France-KLM will be reduced from around 18% to 14%, Air France-KLM Chief Executive       Jean-Marc Janaillac       saidMany airlines have made equity investments recently to strengthen their partnerships amid increasing competition. In the lucrative, high-volume trans-Atlantic route, Middle East airlines and low-cost entrants such as             Norwegian Air Shuttle                   are putting increased pressure on the U.S. and European carriers that long dominated.Delta Chief Executive       Ed Bastian       said airlines need stronger partnerships to compete in an increasingly \u201cdynamic global landscape.\u201dAir France and Delta have been trans-Atlantic partners since 1999, predating the French airline\u2019s merger with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in 2004. The airlines received U.S. antitrust immunity in 2009 to coordinate fares and schedules and share revenue. Such immunity is the closest thing to a merger allowed under U.S. and European rules that limit foreign shareholding in airlines.Other airlines also are partnering more closely. Qatar Airways is the largest shareholder in             British Airways                  \u2019 parent, International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, and recently said it wants to take a 10% stake in             American Airlines Group Inc.despite the U.S. carrier\u2019s opposition.             United Continental Holdings Inc.       has a 5% stake in a low-fare Brazilian carrier and is negotiating to invest in Colombian flag carrier             Avianca Holdings SA      .Such investments can backfire. Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways on Thursday reported a $1.9 billion net loss, in part because of write-downs on failed European airline investments.Mr. Janaillac said its strengthened partnerships would help the airline \u201cregain the offensive again\u201d after a difficult restructuring. Air France has recently battled high costs and labor turmoil, losing money for six consecutive years through 2014. The carrier plans to launch a lower-cost airline named Joon this fall to appeal to millennial customers.Delta has fared better. The No. 2 U.S. airline by traffic is profitable and has pared its net debt to $8.8 billion today from $17 billion in 2009. Its largest shareholder is             Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,       the investment vehicle controlled by longtime airline skeptic       Warren Buffett.Delta has a history of forging partnerships with foreign airlines. The Atlanta-based airline recently acquired 49% in Grupo Aeromexico SA, Mexico\u2019s flag airline. Delta said Thursday that it is discussing ways to bring             Grupo Aeromexico                   into the expanded global partnership, too. Delta also has a minority stake in a Brazilian carrier and already owns 3.5% of China Eastern. Delta recently entered a joint venture with             Korean Air Lines Co.Air France said it hopes to complete the Virgin Atlantic stake purchase this year and receive regulatory approval for the expanded joint venture in early 2018. The partnership would give the joint venture more control over the lucrative London market for trans-Atlantic flights.Air France, Delta and Virgin Atlantic will pursue antitrust immunity for the joint venture, allowing them to closely coordinate prices and schedules.Virgin Atlantic\u2019s chief commercial officer,       Shai Weiss,        said Mr. Branson will retain a 20% stake and remain involved in the airline he founded.

Analysts say it will still be years before driverless cars and other AI products make the company money. Mr. Lu said the firm was still figuring out the best way to monetize such products.But there is concern that Baidu still isn\u2019t a leader in some of its endeavors, such as newsfeed and mobile payments. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said that some key Baidu customers are shifting part of their budgets away to other advertising formats, such as newsfeed Toutiao and             Twitter                  -like Weibo.A day before releasing its earnings, Baidu announced a strategic partnership with U.S. payment processor             PayPal,       which will enable Baidu Wallet users to buy goods online outside of China via PayPal\u2019s 17 million merchants. The tie-up comes as Baidu Wallet tries to catch up to dominant payment systems Alipay, run by             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.       affiliate Ant Financial, and Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay.For the current quarter, Baidu projected revenue of 23.13 billion yuan to 23.75 billion yuan, compared with analysts\u2019 estimates of 23.17 billion yuan.Write to Alyssa Abkowitz at alyssa.abkowitz@wsj.com and Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/baidu-profit-rises-in-rebound-from-chinese-government-crackdown-1501195105", "keywords": ["apps,baidu,china internet,china sales,internet,mobile apps,search advertising,Baidu,BIDU,Tencent Holdings,0700.HK,Qi Lu,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,personal technology,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,internet search engines,computing,online service providers,mobile applications software,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-28 00:09:00", "news_title": "What\u2019s News: World-Wide", "content": "The Republican effort to dismantle the ACA collapsed early Friday when a slimmed-down Senate measure to pare back selected pieces of the 2010 health-care law failed, undermining GOP leaders\u2019 last-ditch effort to deliver on a long-time campaign promise.Senate Republicans moved to block every path Trump might try to use to fire and replace Sessions as attorney general.Scaramucci acknowledged his White House power struggle with Priebus and said their differences may be unbridgeable.The Senate approved new sanctions on Russia for alleged interference in the U.S. election, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote.House Republicans passed legislation funding Trump\u2019s Southwest border wall without having to vote directly on the proposal.Top congressional Republicans and the Trump administration dropped a GOP plan to tax imports and exempt exports.North Korean hackers are increasingly focused on funneling stolen funds to the secretive nation, a South Korean report said.Israel removed the remaining security measures at the entrance to one of Jerusalem\u2019s holiest sites following Arab protests.Japan\u2019s defense minister, an Abe prot\u00e9g\u00e9, announced her resignation over a dispute involving peacekeeping operations in South Sudan.Appeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-news-world-wide-1501214969", "keywords": ["political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,page-one stories,news digests"]}]
