But at least one senator who has voiced concerns about the bill\u2019s Medicaid cuts said Ms. Verma has taken a careful approach by providing data without overselling her proposal.\u201cShe\u2019s not in the business of lobbying, but she\u2019s in the business of getting us good information,\u201d Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) said.Sen.       Bill Cassidy       (R., La.) said, \u201cShe\u2019s obviously a knowledgeable person who\u2019s implemented innovative programs...That gives a great deal of street credibility.\u201dSen.       Susan Collins       of Maine, one of the Republicans who is opposed to the GOP bill, said she wasn\u2019t convinced by the pitch because the amount going to consumers would fall far short of the bill\u2019s $756 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid funding over a decade. Under the plan, up to $200 billion from the taxes would go to support affected low-income people.\u201cIf you\u2019re still going to take more than $700 billion out of the Medicaid program, you still have significant problems,\u201d Ms. Collins said.Administration officials, including Mr. Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary       Tom Price,        have visited Capitol Hill in recent days. Republican senators have frequently cited Ms. Verma as providing detailed arguments for the GOP bill.Still, Medicaid cuts are only one issue cited by Republicans concerned about the bill. Some worry about losing consumer protections; others fear premiums won\u2019t be reduced enough.Under the latest version of the Republican health bill, the number of uninsured would increase by 22 million in 2026, compared with the current law, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office released Thursday. Federal deficits would shrink by $420 billion over the coming decade, the CBO estimated.With President       Donald Trump       signaling Wednesday that the administration will play a more aggressive role in wrangling 50 senators to support the bill, it appears Ms. Verma, a 46-year-old daughter of Indian-American immigrants, will play a large role in the coming days.Ms. Verma cut her teeth professionally as a consultant to states, including Indiana, that introduced conservative changes to their Medicaid programs through a complex waiver process.On Monday, Ms. Verma met with Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.) and Mr. Portman. She met Wednesday morning with Sen.       Shelley Moore Capito       (R., W.Va.), and that evening with about 20 senators gathered in the Capitol.At White House and Senate meetings Wednesday, Ms. Verma discussed the Medicaid provision at length. She has also been showing every senator numbers to illustrate how funds and waivers could affect their state, according to a person close to Ms. Verma. The goal is convincing them that the program could be put on a stable footing without hurting individuals, this person said.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who presides over the chamber\u2019s 52 Republicans, can lose only two GOP votes, with Mr. Pence casting a tiebreaking vote if necessary. His task has been complicated by Wednesday\u2019s announcement that Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.) has been diagnosed with brain cancer; it isn\u2019t clear when he might return to Washington.The health debate has drawn Ms. Verma into an unfamiliar limelight, and White House officials said they are counting on her persuasiveness. They said they struggled in early phases of the House debate because Ms. Verma hadn\u2019t yet been confirmed, and they credit her with winning over House members at later stages.But many remain skeptical of her Medicaid proposal. Democrats and some Republicans said a one-time infusion of money, which aides and lawmakers said would likely be between $160 billion and $200 billion, wouldn\u2019t make up for far larger cuts to Medicaid over a longer period.\u201cThat\u2019s one of those tiny Band-Aids that you use for a child\u2019s cut,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.). \u201cI would hope that won\u2019t win over any votes just to postpone the pain for a couple years or a couple months.\u201dSenate leaders say they expect to vote next week on a motion allowing them to begin debate on a health bill. But if Ms. Verma\u2019s proposal looks like it is picking up votes, GOP leaders could delay the vote to gather more support.One of Ms. Verma\u2019s few public appearances not related to health care came at a White House event in May celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month.She talked about growing up in the U.S. at a time when people confused Indians with Native Americans, asking her what tribe she was from.She remembered her mother ruining silk saris by putting them in a U.S. washing machine. And she joked about her father\u2019s criticism of her 95% score on a test and\u2014years later\u2014her son\u2019s score of 89% on a math test that her daughter dubbed an \u201cAsian fail.\u201dThe U.S. is different now, she said. People now ask her which part of India her family is from, and they associate India with yoga and meditation, \u201cwhich I can say I haven\u2019t done much of\u201d lately.\u2014Stephanie Armour contributed to this article.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition."}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/special-counsel-investigating-possible-money-laundering-by-paul-manafort-1500587532", "news_title": "Special Counsel Investigating Possible Money Laundering by Paul Manafort ", "news_time": "2017-07-20 17:52:00", "keywords": "election ,fbi,hacking,intelligence committee,manafort,money laundering,russia,special counsel,trump,Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,The Senate,the Treasury Department,Paul Manafort,Jared Kushner,Donald Trump,Robert Mueller,political,general news,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Special Counsel       Robert Mueller       is investigating possible money laundering by       Paul Manafort,       Donald Trump\u2019s      \u00a0former campaign manager, as part of his criminal investigation into what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Kremlin-backed campaign to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, according to a person familiar with the matter.The inquiry into the issue by Mr. Mueller, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and his team began several weeks ago, this person said.\u00a0A spokesman for Mr. Manafort,       Jason Maloni,        declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Mr. Mueller.Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation is focusing on Russian meddling as well as whether any members of the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion and described investigations into the issue a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Russia has denied meddling.The Senate and House intelligence committees also are probing possible money laundering by Mr. Manafort, according to people with knowledge of those investigations.The Senate committee also has received reports from the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which tracks illicit money flows, to learn if any of Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses may have financial ties to Russian interests, these people said. Mr. Trump has said he has no such ties.Mr. Manafort, a Republican political consultant, spent years working for a pro-Russia party in Ukraine. He served as Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign manager for roughly three months in 2016 before resigning.New York Attorney General       Eric Schneiderman       and Manhattan District Attorney       Cyrus Vance Jr.       also are investigating Mr. Manafort\u2019s real-estate transactions, The Wall Street Journal has reported, with both offices examining his dealings for possible money-laundering and fraud. Messrs. Schneiderman and Vance are Democrats.Mr. Manafort has spent and borrowed tens of millions of dollars in connection with properties in the U.S. over the past decade, including a Brooklyn, N.Y., townhouse and California properties being developed by his son-in-law, the Journal has reported.Through his spokesman, Mr. Manafort has said his \u201cpersonal investments in real estate are all ordinary business transactions.\u201dIn April, before Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel, the Justice Department requested Mr. Manafort\u2019s banking records as part of the Russia probe that is now being led by Mr. Mueller, the Journal reported.And earlier this month, the Journal reported that the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office had subpoenaed records relating to up to $16 million in loans that a bank run by       Steve Calk,        a former campaign economic adviser to Mr. Trump, made to Mr. Manafort.Mr. Manafort and two other top Trump campaign aides\u2014Donald Trump Jr. and the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser,       Jared Kushner      \u2014are expected to speak with Senate committees next week as part of their inquiries.\u2014Shane Harris and Aruna Viswanatha contributed to this article.Write to Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'Mueller Probes Manafort Finances.'"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/financier-anthony-scaramucci-to-be-named-white-house-communications-director-1500607948", "news_title": "Financier Anthony Scaramucci Likely to Be Named White House Communications Director", "news_time": "2017-07-21 01:00:00", "keywords": " communications director,the mooch, trump administration, white house press office,Anthony Scaramucci,Donald Trump,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,audiovisual production,alternative investments,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities,media,entertainment", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Financier       Anthony Scaramucci,        a top donor to President       Donald Trump       during the campaign, is expected to be named White House communications director on Friday, two White House officials said.Mr. Scaramucci, 53 years old, is the founder of hedge-fund investing firm SkyBridge Capital and a hedge-fund conference known as SALT. Known as \u201cThe Mooch,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci previously hosted a financial TV show on             Fox Business Network                   and has been a frequent guest advocating for Mr. Trump on cable news shows.Mr. Scaramucci didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Separately,       Marc Kasowitz,        Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney who is representing him in Special Counsel       Robert Mueller\u2019s       probe of the links of the president\u2019s associates to Russia, is expected to take on a lesser role on Mr. Trump\u2019s outside legal team, according to a person familiar with the shift.Mr. Kasowitz\u2019s spokesman, Mark Corallo, resigned from his post this week after less than two months on the job, according to a person familiar with his decision, after privately expressing frustration over the administration\u2019s handling of episodes such as the revelation of a meeting Donald Trump Jr. arranged in June 2016 between top campaign aides and a Russian lawyer.Mr. Corallo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Scaramucci, who worked at             Goldman Sachs                   and graduated from Harvard Law School, would join a communications office that has been a target of criticism from Republicans in Washington and Mr. Trump himself.The White House has been seeking a communications director since       Mike Dubke      resigned from the role at the end of May, \u200bas the president aimed to reset his administration amid expanding probes into his associates\u2019 ties to Russia. Mr. Scaramucci had been a top candidate for the role of director for the Office of Public Liaison before it was given to       George Sifakis.Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s new job was first reported by Axios.com.The president has complained privately that the press team has been at times too slow or ineffective in defending him, most notably following his firing of former FBI director       James Comey.       But some White House officials counter that the West Wing has a problem with decision making, not public relations. Several people approached by White House officials have turned down offers to join the team, people familiar with the conversations said.Since Mr. Dubke resigned, press secretary       Sean Spicer       has been filling in for the role of communications director, while deputy press secretary       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       has taken over at the podium for most White House briefings, which have been off-camera since late last month.Mr. Scaramucci was active during the 2016 presidential race. After having originally supported Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker for the Republican presidential nomination, and then former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, he threw his support behind Mr. Trump and became one of his most vocal supporters.Mr. Scaramucci is serving as chief strategist at the U.S. Export Import Bank. His appointment to that role followed months of uncertainty about Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s prospects of joining the White House, after a promised role in the White House was handed to someone else.The move to shift Mr. Scaramucci to the communications team comes as Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are crafting a strategy that aims to contain Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation and ensure it doesn\u2019t veer into Mr. Trump\u2019s private business dealings.\u201cThe special counsel\u2019s investigatory activities are limited by his mandate. And looking at a real-estate deal from 10 years ago would exceed that mandate,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, referencing a Bloomberg story that said Mr. Mueller is looking into Trump business deals dating back years.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers also would be looking at potential conflicts of interest in the Mueller legal team, Mr. Sekulow said. \u201cConflict of interest issues, if they arise, will be addressed in due course through the normal legal channels if we get to that stage. Any lawyer would look at potential conflicts,\u201d he said.The recourse for Trump\u2019s legal team would be to first approach Mr. Mueller and then the deputy attorney general overseeing the investigation,       Rod Rosenstein,        Mr. Sekulow said. \u200bMr. Mueller\u2019s office declined to comment.Write to Michael C.
