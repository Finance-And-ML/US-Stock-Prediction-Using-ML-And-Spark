His filing also acknowledged that his firm, DMP International, was paid more than $17 million for his lobbying work for a Ukrainian political party.Ukraine was the longtime battleground where Russia and the West sought influence in the years before Moscow seized the country\u2019s Crimean peninsula and Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014.Lobbying work on the behalf of foreign governments to influence political activities in the U.S. is tightly controlled by the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The law includes substantial criminal penalties for violations but hasn\u2019t been aggressively enforced.Mr. Manafort, a lobbyist and Republican operative who has cultivated an international client list over the years, is one of several aides to Mr. Trump facing scrutiny by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and several congressional committees, according to people familiar with the matter. Both Mr. Manafort and former Trump administration national security adviser Mike Flynn are being investigated for potential criminal violations of FARA, these people said.The FBI has also said it is investigating allegations that Russia interfered in last year\u2019s presidential campaign. Russia has denied meddling in the election.Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn have both denied any wrongdoing.Mr. Flynn\u2019s attorney declined to comment.Jason Maloni,        a spokesman for Mr. Manafort, has previously said that Mr. Manafort has asked for and followed guidance from authorities on how to appropriately account for his lobbying work.\u201cToday, Paul Manafort registered with the Department of Justice\u2019s FARA unit for his work on behalf of Ukraine\u2019s Party of Regions,\u201d Mr. Maloni said Tuesday. \u201cHe started this process in concert with FARA\u2019s unit in September, before the outcome of the election and well before any formal investigation of election interference began.\u201d\u201cPaul\u2019s primary focus was always directed at domestic Ukrainian political campaign work, and that is reflected in today\u2019s filing,\u201d he added. \u201cPaul has appreciated the professionalism and guidance of the FARA unit throughout this process.\u201dIn the filings, Mr. Maloni noted that Mr. Manafort\u2019s firm also reported that it paid out nearly $4 million in expenses to various vendors and consultants in its Ukraine work.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to detail Manafort\u2019s net pay, but it was in line with what political consultants earn for this type of work,\u201d he said.\u201dThe White House referred questions to Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney, who didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Mr. Manafort\u2019s ties to the former Ukrainian\u2019s presidential campaign were first reported last summer based on emails obtained by journalists. The disclosure led to his resignation as the top official on the Trump campaign.Mr. Manafort has previously insisted he didn\u2019t need to file as a foreign agent for his work with the Ukrainian president because his expertise as a political consultant was applied in Ukraine, not the U.S. But a sliver of that work ultimately did take him to Washington, when he became involved in a 2012-14 effort by a Brussels-based nonprofit with links to the Ukrainian leader\u2019s political party to burnish Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s image as a pro-European leader despite his close ties to Moscow.Tuesday\u2019s filings detailed Mr. Manafort\u2019s involvement in the Washington-based campaign and disclosed a small number of U.S. contacts. Mr. Manafort contracted with several pollsters and consultants as part of the work. He also reported a $1,000 contribution to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R., Calif.), the only member of Congress to receive such a donation.Mr. Rohrabacher didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Mr. Manafort also reported paying roughly $1.3 million to contractors and consultants as part of the campaign, as well as reported spending more than $2.6 million on travel, meals and living expenses. It is unclear if those expenses were reimbursed by his Ukrainian client, Party of Regions, or were spent out of the roughly $17 million paid to Mr. Manafort\u2019s company.Mr. Manafort\u2019s reported work appeared to end in early 2014, when Mr. Yanukovych was ousted by violent demonstrations in Kiev, according to the documents filed under FARA.To perform the work on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych, Mr. Manafort helped advise the Brussels-based nonprofit, European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, which then hired two U.S. lobbying firms, the Podesta Group and Mercury.Those firms both filed as foreign agents earlier this year after they concluded, following consultations with the Justice Department, that their work could be construed as having benefited a foreign government. The firms said they believed at the time they were working for a nonprofit unconnected to the Ukrainian regime.Both had originally registered with the U.S. House and U.S. Senate under less restrictive lobbying rules that govern corporate and nonprofit lobbying.U.S. lobbying law doesn\u2019t apply to American political consultants who work on foreign election campaigns or advise political parties and figures in foreign countries. But lobbying work that aims to influence political activity in the U.S. on the behalf of foreign governments, foreign political parties and other entities linked to foreign regimes is tightly controlled by FARA.The law dates back to the World War II-era and was first aimed at curbing foreign propaganda before evolving into the primary tool to regulate foreign government lobbying in the U.S.The law requires foreign agents to file regular updates with the DOJ on contacts with U.S. media outlets and lawmakers, as well as to publicly make available any propaganda materials created and disseminated as part of a campaign on behalf of foreign governments.Corporations, individuals and nonprofits that hire lobbyists, by contrast, generally register under the less restrictive Lobbying Disclosure Act, where only minimal information about issue-based lobbying campaigns, such as tax reform or immigration, are publicly disclosed.As part of the FBI\u2019s investigation, grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia have been issued to associates of Mr. Flynn, ordering them to hand over any information concerning his Turkey-related activities. The FARA probe of Mr. Flynn is running parallel to a similar probe looking at Mr. Manafort\u2019s work for Ukraine, people familiar with the matter said.Those probes now are being overseen by Robert Mueller, a special counsel hired by the Justice Department.Write to Alan Cullison at alan.cullison@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Manafort Files as Agent Of a Foreign Government.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 22:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-trump-campaign-manager-paul-manafort-registers-as-foreign-agent-1498611196", "news_title": "Ex-Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort Registers as Foreign Agent", "keywords": "manafort russia,manafort ukraine,russia investigations,russia u.s. election,trump campaign officials,trump russia,Paul Manafort,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "SINTRA, Portugal\u2014The euro soared to its biggest one-day gain against the dollar in a year and eurozone bond prices slumped after European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi       hinted the ECB might start winding down its stimulus in response to accelerating growth in Europe.Any move by the ECB toward reducing bond purchases would put it on a similar policy path as the Federal Reserve, which first signaled an intent to taper its own stimulus program in 2013. But the ECB is likely to remain far behind: The Fed has been raising interest rates gradually since December 2015, while the ECB\u2019s key rate has been negative since June 2014.Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments, made Tuesday at the ECB\u2019s annual economic policy conference in Portugal, were laced with caution and caveats. But investors interpreted them as a cue to buy euros and sell eurozone bonds, a reversal of a long-term trade that has benefited from the central bank\u2019s \u20ac60 billion ($67.15 billion) of bond purchases each month.\u201cAll the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Following Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments, the euro jumped 1.4% against the dollar, the largest daily percentage rise since June 2016, to end U.S. trading at $1.1340. It is the euro\u2019s highest level against the greenback since August 2016.The yield on government debt in countries such as Germany and Italy alsorose sharply. Bond yields rise as prices fall.The \u20ac2.3 trillion bond-buying program has had a large impact on financial markets, and Tuesday\u2019s moves indicate that investors are girding for the day it ends. The bond purchases helped drive down borrowing costs, which economists say aided growth and investment.Until now, the ECB\u2019s top officials have carefully avoided discussing the future of their bond-buying program, also referred to as quantitative easing, which is due to continue through December. They worry that such a discussion could lead to a repeat of the turmoil in financial markets four years ago, known as the taper tantrum, when the Fed signaled it would wind down its QE. That might upset the region\u2019s economic recovery.On Tuesday, though, Mr. Draghi appeared to shift course. He argued that leaving the ECB\u2019s policy unchanged as the euro area\u2019s recovery strengthened would amount to increasing its stimulus\u2014a hint that policy makers will instead start to reduce their bond purchases rather than maintain the status quo.\u201cToday Draghi moved his first step towards indicating that ECB monetary policy will become less [stimulative] in 2018,\u201d said       Marco Valli,        an economist with             UniCredit                   in Milan.Pressure has been mounting on the ECB to change course as evidence accumulates that its aggressive stimulus is bearing fruit and as political uncertainty in the region fades following       Emmanuel Macron\u2019s       election as French president.\u201cPolitical winds are becoming tailwinds,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cThere is newfound confidence in the reform process, and newfound support for European cohesion, which could help unleash pent-up demand and investment.\u201dThe eurozone has notched 16 straight quarters of economic growth, creating more than six million jobs, and business- and consumer-confidence indicators have risen to multiyear highs.The change comes as the Fed signals it will continue to raise interest rates over the coming years. Fed officials indicated earlier this month they are on course to raise borrowing costs once more in 2017, after increasing the bank\u2019s benchmark rate twice this year to the current range between 1% and 1.25%. The U.S. central bank also plans to begin reducing the amount of bonds it holds.Earlier this month, the ECB took a tiny step toward ending its stimulus by signaling it probably wouldn\u2019t cut interest rates any further below zero. Many analysts expect the central bank to announce in September or October that it will start early next year to taper, or wind down, its QE program.Mr. Draghi didn\u2019t directly address the question of timing. He instead emphasized the positive developments in the eurozone, including quickening economic growth and reduced political uncertainty.Michael Schubert,        an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said the latest remarks were \u201canother sign suggesting that the central bank is moving towards an exit\u201d from its stimulus.\u2018For us to be assured\u00a0about the return of inflation to our objective, we need\u00a0persistence\u00a0in our monetary policy.\u2019Still, the ECB chief stressed that moves to stop bond purchases would \u201chave to be made gradually,\u201d and only when the path of growth and inflation was \u201csufficiently secure.\u201dSome analysts called for caution. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we should be surprised by\u201d Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments, economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a research note. \u201cWhat he said today is also consistent with a very slow exit.\u201dIf so, that would disappoint officials in Northern Europe, who have been pressing for a swift end to the ECB\u2019s monetary stimulus. In Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, officials have called for years for an end to policies they complain hurt savers and pensioners.The dilemma for ECB officials is that while eurozone growth is accelerating, outpacing the U.S. in the first quarter, the area\u2019s inflation rate remains weak. It slid to 1.4% in May, some way below the ECB\u2019s target of just under 2%.Nevertheless, Mr. Draghi said fears of deflation, a destructive cycle of price and wage declines, had passed. These worries played into the ECB\u2019s decision to launch QE in the first place.\u201cDeflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones,\u201d he said.Mr. Valli of UniCredit said the ECB might reduce its monthly bond purchases to \u20ac40 billion in the first half of next year, followed by a further reduction to \u20ac20 billion a month in the second half of the year. That would be a slower pace of stimulus reduction than many analysts expect.However, the ECB is expected to face a challenge if it wants to extend QE much beyond the middle of next year. The central bank is soon expected to start running short of bonds to buy, particularly German debt, due to self-imposed constraints in the design of QE.Write to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Draghi\u2019s Outlook Boosts Euro.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 22:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecbs-draghi-says-hes-in-no-rush-to-end-easy-money-1498556533", "news_title": "ECB\u2019s Draghi Hints at Possible Winding Down of Eurozone Stimulus", "keywords": " central banking, ecb, ecb rates, euro, eurozone, eurozone economy, eurozone growth, eurozone interest rates, eurozone monetary policy, mario draghi, monetary policy,qe in europe,European Central Bank,Federal Reserve,Mario Draghi,Marco Valli,Michael Schubert,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,inflation,prices,monetary policy,central bank intervention,interest rates,euro zone,currency,economic news,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Another big investor is calling for revisions to the landmark proposed merger of             Dow Chemical Co.        DOW 1.55%       and             DuPont Co.        DD 1.61%Glenview Capital Management LLC recently met with leaders of both companies and pushed for changes in a plan to break the combined group into three parts, according to a letter the hedge fund sent to its investors late\u00a0Tuesday.The fund also criticized Dow\u2019s decision to delay the retirement of Chief Executive       Andrew Liveris,        who was originally supposed to step down around now but now plans to stay on longer, according to the letter, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Glenview believes the delay and the current split plan will impact Dow\u2019s ability to find a new leader.The chemical giants announced their roughly $60 billion merger in December 2015. Shareholders approved it last July and after a delay winning regulatory approval are now expected to complete the deal in August.\u00a0Within 18 months\u00a0of completion, the behemoth is supposed to split into three companies: one agricultural, one focused on materials and another on specialty-chemical products.Investors have grown wary of the details of the breakup plan and the companies said in May they would review it. Dow and DuPont have said they \u201care fully aligned regarding the objective of the review\u201d and would consult with investors.In a statement, the two companies said Mr. Liveris and DuPont Chief Executive       Edward Breen       are in \u201cdaily communication working collaboratively along with the companies\u2019 lead independent directors to advance a strategic review of the portfolio mix and alignment across divisions.\u201dThe companies added the boards were committed to maximizing the value of all the spinoffs and welcomed investor feedback.Glenview\u2019s letter says it owns about $1 billion of Dow stock, amounting to less than 1% of the company\u2019s total value. The fund, which isn\u2019t typically a public activist, said in the letter that it largely supports the roadmap       Daniel Loeb\u2019s       Third Point LLC detailed last month in a presentation. The activist, another Dow investor, called for shifting nearly a third of the earnings from the proposed materials business to the specialty-products operation.Trian Fund Management LP, another activist that\u2019s a big DuPont shareholder, has also privately pushed for changes, as have other investors and analysts, people familiar with the matter have said.In general, the investors argue that the materials company should be a more commodity-focused business that would trade at lower multiples, while the specialty business could comprise a mix of higher-margin chemical and other products.Glenview\u2019s letter raises Mr. Liveris\u2019s tenure as a concern too, saying it voted for the deal in part because Dow had announced he would step down this month. Earlier this year, Dow said Mr. Liveris would stay on as CEO until next year as a way to see the deal through and help with the formation of the materials business.\u201cThe change in the committed timeline that was clear prior to shareholder approval of the transaction is inappropriate and creates the appearance of conflict between personal and communal goals,\u201d Glenview wrote.Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 21:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dow-investor-glenview-calls-for-changes-in-post-dupont-merger-breakup-1498604008", "news_title": "Dow Investor Glenview Calls for Changes in Post-DuPont Merger Breakup ", "keywords": "agricultural,chemical,divestiture,materials,merger,post merger,specialty products,Dow Chemical,DOW,DuPont Fabros,DD,Glenview Capital Management,Andrew Liveris,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,management,management moves,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,chemicals,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,basic materials,resources,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump       said\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0he intends to nominate Christopher Campbell, a Republican Senate staffer, to be the Treasury Department\u2019s assistant secretary for financial institutions.Mr. Campbell currently serves as the staff director for the Senate Finance Committee, where he oversees the Senate GOP agenda on issues related to taxes, Trade, Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security and the national debt. He previously served as a legislative director for Finance Committee Chairman       Orrin Hatch       (R., Utah).Mr. Campbell\u2019s nomination is an important step toward filling the upper ranks of the Treasury Department, which has few Senate-confirmed officials.

Nomura has estimated that the current residential fiber-optic coverage was around 66% as of December 2015, but is estimated to be around 96% by the end of 2018.The IPO would also strengthen Singtel\u2019s balance sheet and give it more scope to undertake mergers and acquisitions. In 2015,\u00a0the company spent US$810 million to buy Trustwave, a U.S.-based company that specializes in managed security services used for protection of IT infrastructure and dealing with cyberthreats.SingTel is Southeast Asia\u2019s largest telecommunication company in terms of subscribers.

The company described itself as a victim of Tuesday\u2019s attack, saying the virus had disrupted its own operations. It said that when it released its latest software on June 22 it didn\u2019t contain any virus.Some experts disagreed with that assessment. The software was pushed out to customers five days ago and then quietly spread within corporate networks before being triggered on Tuesday, said       Craig Williams,        security outreach manager with             Cisco Systems Inc.,       a networking hardware company, Kaspersky Lab ZAO, an antivirus company, also cited Intellekt Servis as a main source of the outbreak but saw no evidence of triggering mechanism.The cyber security department of Ukraine\u2019s national police warned on its             Facebook                   page that preliminary analysis suggested the accounting software was \u201conly one of the vectors of the attack.\u201d The Russian security firm Group-IB agreed, saying it saw companies infected via malicious email attachments.Many victims of the ransomware were told to pay a $300 ransom demand in the digital currency bitcoin. Still, others saw not only financial but political motivations behind the attack, which struck the day before Constitution Day, a Ukrainian national holiday.\u201cI think not only is it out there trying to make a profit, but it\u2019s also making a very clear political statement: it\u2019s intentionally trying to damage businesses that interact with the Ukrainian tax system, \u201c Mr. Williams said.Anton Gerashchenko,        an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, said the cyberattacks could be connected to the holiday and blamed Russia.Mr. Gerashchenko didn\u2019t address why Russian companies would have been victims of an alleged Russian attack. But security experts say it only would have taken one customer of the tax software within a Russian company to have spread the virus.Ukraine is locked in a bitter proxy war with its larger neighbor. Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and has backed separatists in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region. In parallel, the country has been besieged with what Ukrainian government officials and cybersecurity experts describe as a concerted Russian cyberoffensive.Russia denies state hacking.During the May attack, a virus dubbed WannaCry inflicted damage by locking computer systems that were old or weren\u2019t adequately patched, demanding ransom. That attack hit hospitals in the U.K., car factories in France and smaller businesses across the continent.WannaCry was stopped in part because the virus included a \u201ckill switch\u201d that allowed security researchers to stop its spread. But many computers likely remain vulnerable to the underlying Windows computer flaw that WannaCry leveraged. Although security experts said that Petya may not jump from infected company to infected company as quickly as WannaCry, the new virus uses new techniques that allow it to spread more quickly within corporations.\u201cThis is going to continue,\u201d said       Mikko Hypponen,        chief research officer with cyber security company             F-Secure Corp.       \u201cThis is going to go on all night. This is going to go on tomorrow.\u201dIn Ukraine, the Infrastructure Ministry, a telecom company, the state postal service, the airport in Kiev, energy firms and several banking institutions have been hit by the virus, Ukrainian authorities said. The extent of the operational disruption was unclear at the affected companies.By midday on Tuesday, the attack had infected more than 100 institutions in Ukraine, Russia and other former soviet Republics, security experts said.\u201cIt does not seem to be targeting anyone in particular,\u201d said       Catalin Cosoi,        chief security strategist of computer security vendor BitDefender LLC. \u201cThey seem to be infecting as many people as possible.\u201dThe ransomware was designed to spread within corporate networks running             Microsoft Corp.\u2019s       Windows operating system, but didn\u2019t appear to be harming consumers, security experts said. A Microsoft spokeswoman said that the company was investigating the outbreak.Victims are told to pay a $300 ransom demand, payable in bitcoin, Mr. Cosoi said. BitDefender has tracked 27 payments to the digital bitcoin wallet used by the attackers.Russia\u2019s state-controlled oil company Rosneft said it was under a \u201cmassive hacker attack\u201d that could have serious consequences but said its oil production wasn\u2019t affected.Rosneft, the world\u2019s largest publicly listed oil company by production, said it had contacted law-enforcement authorities about the attack. The company\u2019s website was down on Tuesday, but its official             Twitter                   accounts spread news of the attack. The company said it had recently switched to a different oil reserve-control system, so \u201cneither oil production nor preparation processes were stopped.\u201dStill, U.S. crude-oil prices surged, rising above $44 a barrel for the first time in almost a week on news of the attack on Rosneft.Russia\u2019s central bank said several banks had been hit by the virus, but that there was no indication that banking systems had been damaged, Interfax news agency reported.As the day unfolded, more big companies became victims of Tuesday\u2019s cyberattack.Merck, one of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies, said its \u201ccomputer network was compromised today as part of global hack.\u201dWPP,       the London-based advertising conglomerate, said its IT systems across several companies were affected by a \u201csuspected cyberattack.\u201dDLA Piper, DLA Piper, a large U.S. business law firm, and TNT, a delivery service owned by             FedEx                   Corp., also said they were being hit by cyberattacks.Denmark\u2019s shipping giant Maersk said Tuesday that its computer systems had been brought down by a cyberattack. The breakdown was affecting multiple computer systems across several business units, a Maersk spokeswoman said.The computer outage had real-life fallout around the world, affecting more than a dozen of Maersk\u2019s port-operating units, said a person with knowledge of the situation, including in Rotterdam and at ports on the U.S. East Coast.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said Maersk\u2019s terminal facility in Elizabeth, N.J., was closed for the day after saying it was \u201cexperiencing system issues.\u201d\u2014Costas Paris, Jennifer Smith, Joseph Walker, Paul Ziobro and Jacob Gershman in New York and Lara O\u2019Reilly in London contributed to this article.Write to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com, David Gauthier-Villars at David.Gauthier-Villars@wsj.com and James Marson at james.marson@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Cyberattacks Spread Across Globe.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 20:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cyberattacks-hit-global-companies-in-europe-1498575793", "news_title": "Cyberattacks Hit Major Companies Across Globe", "keywords": "Merck,MRK,MRK.XE,DLA Piper,Merck &,Rosneft Oil,RU:ROSN,WPP,UK:WPP,FedEx,FDX,Maersk,Catalin Cosoi,Mikko Hypponen,Craig Williams,Anton Gerashchenko,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,legal action,malware,cybercrime,hacking,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,pharmaceuticals,legal services,health care,life sciences,business,consumer services,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "Senate Republican leaders abruptly postponed a vote Tuesday on a sweeping health-care bill until after Congress\u2019 July 4 recess, setting off a high-stakes lobbying sprint that could determine the fate of the GOP\u2019s legislation to topple most of the Affordable Care Act.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who worked for weeks in closed-door sessions to craft a bill, told lawmakers that a vote wouldn\u2019t happen until Congress returns from recess the week of July 10.The delay came after efforts stalled to tweak the legislation and garner support from the nine Republican senators who now oppose the bill. The Republican opposition was significant enough that even a routine procedural motion allowing the vote to proceed faced potential defeat.In a test of his leadership, Mr. McConnell now will need to bridge a divide between conservative Republicans, who say the bill retains too many of the ACA\u2019s regulations to significantly lower premiums, and GOP centrists, who worry the legislation goes too far in cutting funding to Medicaid.From now until Congress\u2019 return from the recess, there is likely to be a run of deal-making, arm-twisting and lobbying, with voters voicing their opinions in town-hall meetings, Republican leaders offering changes and organizations trying to sway senators on all sides.The delay is a setback for President       Donald Trump       and Mr. McConnell, who had promised a vote this week. On Monday, Sen.       John Cornyn       of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, tweeted that \u201cI am closing the door\u201d on a delay because \u201cwe need to do it this week.\u201d On Tuesday, asked if the door was back open, Mr. Cornyn tweeted, \u201cJust a crack.\u201dStill, Senate leaders took comfort from the experience of House Republicans, whose own health bill was initially declared dead. They were then able to regroup, bring it to the floor and pass it in May.Senate Republicans say they must pass the legislation before Congress\u2019 August recess. If that doesn\u2019t occur, the path ahead would become more difficult and other parts of the GOP agenda would be at risk. Success, on the other hand, could boost momentum for other Republican priorities such as a tax overhaul.Republican senators said the delay had become unavoidable, especially after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found the bill would result in 22 million more people uninsured than the ACA over the next decade.\u201cIt\u2019s the only way forward. People have issues that need to be addressed,\u201d said Sen.       Bob Corker       (R., Tenn.) Tuesday, who has said he has some concerns about the bill but hasn\u2019t come out against it. \u201cI read the CBO report this morning at about 4 a.m., and as you go through it, it raises questions and they\u2019re legitimate.\u201dGOP leaders will try to hammer out a compromise in coming days. \u201cThe hope is that we can at least have an agreement on what we can get enough votes on this week and turn to it when we get back,\u201d said Sen.       Marco Rubio       (R., Fla.). \u201cIt\u2019s possible. I can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s likely until we know more about what options are to address people\u2019s concerns.\u201dOthers were less optimistic. Sen.       Shelley Moore Capito       (R., W.Va.), who objected to the level of Medicaid cuts in the bill, said senators are \u201ccoming at it from all angles.\u201d She said she isn\u2019t sure \u201chow or if\u201d Republicans can come together behind a final version.Democrats said Republicans\u2019 struggles reflected the bill\u2019s underlying problems, particularly the fact that it would reduce health coverage while giving a tax cut to the wealthy.\u201cWhile I\u2019m glad that Senate Republicans have delayed the vote on their health plan, this isn\u2019t cause for celebration,\u201d said Sen. Al Franken (D., Minn.). \u201cThis bill, which has been misguided from the start, needs be thrown out.\u201dMr. McConnell\u2019s challenge is that the bill\u2019s GOP opponents come from both wings of his party, and appeasing one faction could harden the other side\u2019s resistance.Conservative Sens. Mike Lee of Utah,       Rand Paul       of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin are pushing for more deregulation and lower premiums. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas also joined the bill\u2019s opponents on Tuesday, saying the sprint to a vote should be slowed down.Centrist senators opposing the bill are especially concerned about cuts to the Medicaid program, including Sens.       Susan Collins       of Maine, Dean Heller of Nevada, Rob Portman of Ohio and Ms. Capito.Mr. McConnell can only afford to lose two of the 52 Republicans in the chamber, with Vice President       Mike Pence       able to break a 50-50 tie. No Democrats are expected to support the health-care bill.Securing the votes would be a major coup for Mr. Trump, who largely stayed on the sidelines of the Senate discussions until recently. After the vote was postponed Tuesday, the president summoned all Republican senators to the White House.Key centrists\u2014including Ms. Collins, Sen.       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska and Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado\u2014were seated near the president. Mr. Trump opened the meeting with exhortations to get the bill passed, saying \u201cwe\u2019re getting very close.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe have really no choice but to solve the situation,\u201d arguing the ACA, sometimes called Obamacare, is collapsing, an assertion disputed by Democrats.Mr. McConnell, speaking outside the White House, said \u201cwe made good progress\u201d inside. He said the president had heard from conservative Republicans about their calls for insurance-market changes, and from others about the future of Medicaid.\u201cThe one thing I would say is that I think everybody around the table is interested in getting to yes,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we know the status quo is simply unacceptable and unsustainable, and no action is simply not an option.\u201dSeparately, Mr. Pence had half a dozen meetings Tuesday afternoon, including with Messrs. McConnell and Portman, and hosted another four senators for dinner at the vice president\u2019s residence in the evening.Both chambers have to pass the same legislation, and there are several paths to do that. The fastest way would be for the House to vote on the version that passes the Senate. Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of three dozen conservative House Republicans, said Tuesday that amendments would need to be added to get enough Republicans there to support it.\u201cIf it\u2019s predominantly the bill that\u2019s currently in the Senate without significant amendments, there would not be enough votes in the House or the Senate to pass it,\u201d Mr. Meadows said.The Senate bill would strike down much of the ACA, including a requirement that most Americans have insurance or pay a penalty. It would provide smaller tax credits than the ACA\u2019s to help people buy insurance, and it would impose steep spending cuts to Medicaid as well as phasing out enhanced federal funding to the 31 states that expanded the program under the current health law.Republican leaders hope the delay gives them time to reverse the defections and build support, but they acknowledge it could give opponents time to mobilize against the bill. \u201cThe politics of this doesn\u2019t get any easier the longer you wait,\u201d said Sen.       John Thune       (R., S.D.). But he added, \u201cIf we can make some changes that improve the policy in a way that makes it more likely that we can get 50 of our senators to vote for this, then this was a good judgment on behalf of the leader.\u201dAt the same time, some Republican governors continue to express concern.Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a frequent critic of the GOP health efforts, said the Senate bill was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Echoing Democratic complaints, Mr. Kasich said the bill didn\u2019t provide adequate funding for resources such as Medicaid and tax credits that help low-income people obtain insurance, in exchange for tax breaks to the \u201calready very wealthy.\u201d\u2014Louise Radnofsky, Natalie Andrews, Byron Tau and Michelle Hackman contributed to this article.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Short on Backers, GOP Delays VoteOn Health Bill.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 20:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-health-bill-vote-delayed-until-after-congress-july-4-recess-1498586899", "news_title": "Short on Backers, GOP Delays Vote on Health Bill", "keywords": "aca,delay,delay vote,health,health law,law,mitch mcconnell,obamacare,senate,senate health bill, vote delay,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,health care policy,political,general news,society,community,health planning,personal finance,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "Passengers aboard a New York City subway train that derailed Tuesday morning in Manhattan first felt the violent lurch of the train cars. Then there was darkness.In the next several minutes, some passengers said they were forced to make what felt like a life-or-death decision: Wait for help or escape the train to the subway tunnels.According to the Fire Department of the City of New York, 39 people were injured in the derailment that happened at about 9:40 a.m. on an A train traveling southbound between 135th Street and 125th Street stations in Harlem. None of the injuries were life-threatening.But inside the train cars, tensions rose among panicked riders, with some breaking through windows to enter other cars and with many others weighing whether to stay on the train or \u201ctake my chances on the track,\u201d said Manhattan resident Kirk James, who was aboard the derailed train.\u201cIt literally was a horror movie,\u201d said Mr. James, who decided to stay.Joseph Lhota,        the new chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said the train derailed after the emergency brakes automatically engaged, not because of a problem on the tracks.The train \u201cbucked forward, it bucked backwards\u201d and then two cars derailed, scraping a side wall, Mr. Lhota said during a news conference.The agency\u2019s interim executive director, Veronique Hakim, said a preliminary visual inspection of the scene showed that the derailment damaged the track, switch and the concrete wall.Mr. Lhota said that the derailed train had to be removed before the MTA could assess the full extent of the damage to the tracks and other equipment. On Tuesday afternoon, there were still service suspensions and delays on A, B, C, D, E, F, and M train lines.Passengers were able to exit from the derailed train via two cars that came to a rest inside the 125th Street station. Still, some panicked passengers evacuated through the rear of the train onto the tracks, \u201cwhich we never encourage,\u201d Mr. Lhota said.In addition to the derailed train, three other trains, carrying an estimated 800 people, were stuck in tunnels between 110th and 135th streets. Some 200 firefighters and 100 police officers went down to the tracks to escort passengers.FDNY commissioner Daniel Nigro said some 500 people \u201cdecided to leave the trains\u201d and walk through tunnels to escape.\u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous thing,\u201d Mr. Nigro said.Mr. James, the passenger aboard the derailed train, said he was deep into a podcast, riding in a car in the back of the train when suddenly the train \u201cbraked really hard\u201d and \u201ceveryone went flying.\u201dAfter the train stopped, according to Mr. James, a clinical assistant professor of social work at New York University\u2019s Silver School of Social Work, there was no announcement of what happened or any direction on what to do next. That caused tensions to rise, he said.\u201cFolks started to panic,\u201d said Mr. James.Passengers in the car ahead of his started violently banging on the window, ultimately breaking it, Mr. James said. As passengers from the next car started to climb through the window, they reported smelling smoke and seeing fire, he said. During the news conference, Mr. Lhota said the smoke was caused by sparks from the brakes that ignited garbage on the tracks.Sarah Cline, a 27-year-old actress who lives in Upper Manhattan, was riding in the last car of the derailed train on her way to work. After the train came to a \u201cscreeching halt,\u201d there was about 20 minutes of panic and confusion as some passengers helped fellow straphangers, while others broke open the last window of the train to escape onto the tracks.\u201cPeople were making executive decisions because, eventually, the car started to smell like smoke and the smell was getting worse and worse,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a woman in my car having a full-blown panic attack.\u201d\u201cI was definitely scared,\u201d said Ms. Cline. \u201cWhen you go from not knowing if the train is hijacked\u2026to a smoke-filled car, you don\u2019t know what to think.\u201dThe situation recalled for some riders a June video of passengers trying to pry their way out of a disabled F train after being trapped for more than 40 minutes without light or air-conditioning, said Jackie Faherty, 38, who was aboard the second car of the derailed train.Passengers in her car and the one before hers were at the train platform, but not able to immediately exit through the train\u2019s doors. That caused many riders in the car to grumble, \u201c\u2019Oh no, you don\u2019t want to get stuck on one of these trains,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Faherty, a physicist who works at the American Museum of Natural History.Tuesday\u2019s derailment follows a recent spate of incidents in which passengers have let themselves out of stalled trains in tunnels. The MTA appealed to passengers to stay inside cars and to wait for directions from train crew.Beth DeFalco, a spokeswoman for the MTA, said customers should never leave a train on their own, but wait for first responders. The third rail has 750 volts of direct current.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous and potentially deadly and it requires us to shut down power to even more of the system, causing additional delays everywhere because of the safety hazard it presents,\u201d she said.\u2014Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed to this article.Write to Melanie Grayce West at melanie.west@wsj.com and Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Riders Panic as Train Derails, 39 Injured.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 20:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/harlem-subway-derailment-snarls-commute-1498577676", "news_title": "Harlem Subway Derailment Snarls Commute", "keywords": "a train derailment,harlem train derailment,new york city subway derailment,political,general news,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,transport accidents,transport"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Supreme Court term that ended this week was marked by caution emanating from the court\u2019s center, a dynamic that saw the justices move in a relatively modest manner as they sought consensus on high-profile cases.The court\u2019s conservatives prevailed in most of the cases during the term, but their liberal colleagues\u2014who lost the chance to direct the court\u2019s long-term trajectory following President       Donald Trump\u2019s       election\u2014gave up more ground than they might have preferred, winning some influence over outcomes.This move toward consensus could be seen in the term\u2019s two final opinions, which Chief Justice       John Roberts       steered in a way that produced decisions viewed as measured, forgoing rulings that conservatives would have championed as total wins.This week, there were seven votes to open a state grant program to church-run schools on the same terms as public and private schools; two of the most liberal justices,       Ruth Bader Ginsburg       and       Sonia Sotomayor,        dissented, but two other left-leaning justices joined the majority opinion.There also were seven votes\u2014and not the same seven\u2014to confine that decision narrowly to programs similar to the playground-resurfacing fund in dispute in the case. The justices left the \u201creligious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination\u201d for another day. Two deeply conservative justices,       Clarence Thomas       and       Neil Gorsuch,        dissented from that part, but other conservatives signed the majority opinion.The same dynamic could be seen in the court\u2019s decision on Mr. Trump\u2019s temporary travel ban on residents of six predominantly Muslim countries.Ahead of arguments next term over the ban\u2019s legality, the court allowed Mr. Trump to temporarily exclude \u201cforeign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d But it left intact lower-court orders blocking the president from categorically banning other foreign citizens with qualifying relationships, such as those who have relatives, job offers or invitations to study in the U.S.The majority opinion was unsigned. Justices Thomas, Gorsuch and Samuel Alito stated they would let Mr. Trump\u2019s administration implement the full ban, making it clear that six other justices chose compromise.The court\u2019s search for consensus on decisions intensified after Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death in February 2016. That left the justices divided into four-member conservative and liberal camps for an extended period when Senate Republicans declined to consider then-President       Barack Obama\u2019s       court nominee.Several justices have publicly said that a 14-month span with no natural majority on divisive issues forced them to search for common\u2014and therefore, narrower\u2014ground on which five or more of the eight could comfortably stand.The court did find agreement on some rulings that could have a considerable impact on the law, including in a unanimous decision that bolstered the rights of disabled students to expect more than a bare-bones education from public schools.It also endorsed robust protections for free speech, notably in a case that found the government couldn\u2019t refuse to register trademarks that some may deem disparaging or offensive.On the court\u2019s business docket, the justices in several cases tightened rules for where lawsuits can be filed against corporations, with little dissent.It is unclear, however, whether the court\u2019s recent comity will continue when the justices reconvene in October. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers said the president selected Justice Gorsuch because he believed his nominee would stake out sharply conservative positions rather than seek consensus, and so far he has met expectations.Moreover, as conservatives grow more comfortable in their restored majority, the impulse to compromise on defining issues may fade.\u201cI think we could get a sense of the character of the court with Justice Gorsuch on it very soon,\u201d said Vikram Amar, dean of the University of Illinois College of Law.Already, the court has placed on the fall docket cases that trigger deeply held\u2014and conflicting\u2014legal views. The justices are set to decide whether the First Amendment allows a retail business to deny services to gay couples whose marriages offend the owner\u2019s faith.At the center of the court stands Justice       Anthony Kennedy,        an appointee of former President       Ronald Reagan       whose maverick views on some issues, including abortion rights, same-sex marriage and capital punishment, have flustered fellow conservatives.Through the spring, some Republicans hoped that Justice Kennedy, 80 years old, would retire this month, clearing the way for Mr. Trump to fill his seat with a more ideologically consistent conservative. Justice Kennedy hasn\u2019t announced any plans to retire.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very illuminating term for getting a sense of what the dividing lines on the court are at this point,\u201d said       Leonard Leo,        executive vice president of the Federalist Society, a conservative-leaning group, and an adviser to Mr. Trump.Write to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com and Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Consensus Marks High Court Term.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 20:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/consensus-marks-supreme-court-term-1498608657", "news_title": "Consensus Marks Supreme Court Term", "keywords": " chief justice john roberts, church playgrounds, clarence thomas, consensus, conservatives, liberals, neil gorsuch, president donald trump, ruth bader ginsburg,supreme court, term, travel ban,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,elections,national,presidential elections,judicial branch"}, {"content": "The U.S. military stepped up preparations on Tuesday for a possible strike against the Syrian regime after Washington said it picked up signs that President       Bashar al-Assad       was preparing to use chemical weapons again.The White House set the stage for a new showdown with Mr. Assad and his allies with an unusual warning late Monday that the Syrian regime would pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d if it launches another chemical-weapons attack on its own people.turkeyAleppoRaqqaDeirEzzoursyriaHoms", "news_time": "2017-06-27 20:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pentagon-sees-signs-syria-is-preparing-for-chemical-attack-1498571456", "news_title": "U.S. Warns Syria Over Chemical Weapons", "keywords": "arms,bombing,chemical,defense department,department of defense,donald,pentagon,russia,shayrat,strike,syria,syrua,threat,trump,weapns,weapons,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,armed forces,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,government bodies,executive branch,military action,war crimes,weapons programs"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Republican-controlled Congress is struggling to overcome intraparty fissures that have been expanding since the rise of the Tea Party in 2010, threatening to derail their legislative ambitions this year.On Tuesday, Senate GOP leaders opted to delay a vote on their bill that would dismantle and replace much of former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       Affordable Care Act in the face of resistance among Senate Republicans over the bill\u2019s policy planks.Just hours earlier, across the Capitol, House Republicans decided to punt until after the July 4 recess on unveiling their budget for fiscal 2018\u2014a necessary prerequisite for their push to overhaul the tax code without Democratic votes\u2014to iron out their own differences.The delays bogging down marquee elements of the GOP agenda left Republicans and President       Donald Trump       with little legislative achievements after nearly six months in power. Republicans, who control the executive and legislative branches for the first time since early 2007, have dwindling time to make significant policy changes before the 2018 midterm-election politics overwhelm the Capitol.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like we\u2019re serving in the minority right now. We just simply don\u2019t know how to govern,\u201d said Rep. Steve Womack (R., Ark.). \u201cHow we\u2019ve been given this opportunity to govern and we are finding every reason in the world not to is absolutely incredible to me.\u201dDemocrats, who are united in opposition to GOP plans, said Republicans\u2019 stalled agenda reflected GOP leaders\u2019 inability to wrest compromise from the dueling factions of their party.\u201cThere\u2019s virtually nothing to show for six months of so-called Republican leadership\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), noting that House Republicans need the support of their most conservative wing to pass a budget. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have a tough time doing it.\u201dThe biggest setback Tuesday came in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he would move a vote expected this week on the GOP health-care bill until after next week\u2019sJuly 4 recess in the face of continued opposition from both centrist and conservative Republicans. Just hours before that decision, his top lieutenant, Sen.       John Cornyn       of Texas, was insisting that the first vote would happen Wednesday.Lawmakers will now have to face energized opponents of their bill at home next week, compounding the political challenge of securing the support of 50 GOP senators to pass the bill. After its own fits-and-starts, the House passed its own version of the bill last month, and it\u2019s far from certain that House members would rubber-stamp a Senate bill and send it to Mr. Trump.Asked about the possibility that members could bolt over recess under pressure from activists at town halls, Mr. McConnell, emerging from a hastily called meeting at the White House with Senate Republicans, all but shrugged. \u00a0\u201cSome members have town halls and some don\u2019t, we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he said.Mr. McConnell has aimed to pass the GOP bill with only Republican votes. Senate Democrats support the ACA and argue that Congress should fix its glitches. On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell warned his colleagues that voting against this plan will give Democrats more sway in future legislative efforts.Pushing the contentious Senate health-care vote into July likely moves action on all of the GOP\u2019s other legislative priorities to later in the year. Most notably, the effort to revamp the U.S. tax system may slow as a result, despite Republicans\u2019 insistence they can complete a major tax bill this year.To get to a tax bill that can also pass on a party-line vote, Republicans have to finish the health bill, one way or the other, and then complete a budget resolution that unlocks the speedier procedures known as reconciliation for the tax bill.Senate Finance Committee Chairman       Orrin Hatch       (R., Utah) said the longer the health debate, \u201cthe more difficult it is going to be to do true tax reform.\u201dOne other roadblock in the tax effort is the intraparty dispute slowing the progress of the House GOP budget.Although House Republicans have agreed on the overall spending levels for military and non-military spending for fiscal year 2018, they remain divided over how big a cut to include for mandatory spending, the federal government\u2019s spending on big safety-net programs such as Medicaid, food stamps and welfare.Many House Republicans want to trim at least $200 billion over 10 years from mandatory spending, with some conservatives pushing for as much as $300 billion. But lawmakers said GOP leaders are concerned that if they set an ambitious goal and then fail to meet it, that could derail the budget process that would enable Republicans to pass a tax-code overhaul without Democratic support.\u201cTo the extent that we put in significant entitlement changes, particularly for low and moderate income people, that would make the task of tax reform much harder,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent (R., Pa.), a key GOP centrist.But conservatives argued that the budget process and the procedural shortcuts it offers may be the only way to lock in spending cuts they have long sought but rarely secured from the biggest portion of the federal budget, where spending cuts are politically difficult.Republicans said they were confident they would resolve the budget dispute early next month.\u201cChairman Black is 100% committed to getting a budget done,\u201d William Allison, a spokesman for Budget Committee Chairwoman Diane Black (R., Tenn.) said Tuesday. \u201cThe committee plans to keep this process moving after the July 4th recess.\u201dWith Congress in session only three weeks in July, lawmakers will face a crush of major policy deadlines before their August recess.In addition to the health-care debate in the Senate and the budget action in the House, Treasury Department officials have urged lawmakers to raise the federal government\u2019s borrowing limit before August to avoid any threat of defaulting on the debt. Many Republicans in recent years have balked at raising the debt limit, giving Democrats leverage in the vote.GOP leaders are also expected to negotiate with Democrats over spending bills needed to keep the government running after its current funding expires on Oct. 1. And Republicans haven\u2019t yet agreed on either the broad strokes or fine details of their tax agenda.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d said Rep. Roger Williams (R., Texas). \u201cWe\u2019ve got to begin to get things done.\u201d\u2014Siobhan Hughes  and Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Intraparty Disputes Stall GOP\u2019s Agenda.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 20:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/intraparty-disputes-stall-republicans-legislative-agenda-1498608305", "news_title": "Intraparty Disputes Stall Republicans\u2019 Legislative Agenda ", "keywords": "budget bill,donald trump,health bill,house,mitch mcconnell,republicans,senate,tax reform,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,elections,upper house,welfare,social services"}, {"content": "The European Union\u2019s antitrust watchdog has handed down a string of big decisions in recent years against top U.S. technology firms, in what might look to U.S. companies and officials like a trend by Brussels to train investigations on large American companies.EU officials deny any bias.\u201cWe don\u2019t go against Google because it\u2019s an American company but because it\u2019s a company abusing its dominant position in our market.\u2026 If it were in Brazil, we wouldn\u2019t care,\u201d a senior EU official said, referring to the EU\u2019s \u20ac2.42 billion ($2.71 billion) fine Tuesday against Google for unfairly favoring its shopping ads in its search results.EU competition officials are, to a large extent, constrained by antitrust rules and legal precedents when making decisions against any companies, be they American, European or otherwise. But unlike Washington, where U.S. enforcers need to prove their cases before a judge, the EU\u2019s competition directorate acts as prosecutor, judge and jury in competition cases\u2014and only needs to convince itself.Experts say American tech companies are currently getting increased scrutiny because they happen to dominate the industry. This comes at a time when one of the top priorities for the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive body, is to ensure the EU\u2019s common market functions more efficiently online and across borders.Asked Tuesday about the perception by some American officials and companies of an anti-U.S. bias in the bloc\u2019s decisions, EU antitrust chief       Margrethe Vestager       said she had reviewed recent cases in different enforcement areas and consistently found that only a small number of the companies affected were American.\u201cI can find no facts to support any kind of bias,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.The EU\u2019s decision on Tuesday to fine             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s        GOOGL 0.59%       Google follows other recent tough decisions against large tech firms.The EU last August ordered             Apple Inc.        AAPL 0.63%       to pay Ireland \u20ac13 billion in allegedly unpaid taxes and in May fined             Facebook Inc.       \u20ac110 million for providing incorrect information or misleading authorities over the acquisition of its messaging unit WhatsApp. A spokesman for Facebook, which didn\u2019t appeal the decision, said at the time: \u201cWe\u2019ve acted in good faith since our very first interactions with the commission and we\u2019ve sought to provide accurate information at every turn.\u201dThe series of decisions come at a time when European tech firms have fallen behind their U.S. counterparts. While Europe led the way in the global smartphone push, it hasn\u2019t been able to foster its own Apple, Facebook or Google.That backdrop has critics of the EU\u2019s moves crying foul.Apple said in December when it appealed the EU\u2019s tax decision that regulators were unfairly targeting the company. \u201cIt\u2019s been clear since the start of this case that there was a predetermined outcome,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said at the time.Former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2015 said the EU\u2019s investigations into U.S. tech companies like Google and Facebook were \u201cmore commercially driven than anything else.\u201d\u201cTheir service providers who, you know, can\u2019t compete with ours\u2014are essentially trying to set up some roadblocks for our companies to operate effectively there,\u201d tech news website ReCode reported Mr. Obama as saying in an interview.The European approach to regulating tech companies clashes with that of authorities in the U.S., which have recently used a more hands-off approach, experts say.\u201cThe vast success of Silicon Valley has been fostered by a deregulated marketplace, but this causes problems when these businesses do business against the very different legal backdrop operating in Europe,\u201d said       Susan Hall,        a Manchester, England-based partner at law firm Clarke Willmott LLP who specializes in intellectual property and information technology. Ms. Hall represents clients ranging from multinationals, government departments, universities to start-ups.Particularly in cases involving tech firms\u2019 handling of personal data, Europe\u2019s more ingrained sensitivities about privacy have taken precedence over what, in the U.S., would be deference to the First Amendment in regard to the freedom of speech and press. For instance, French regulators have ordered Google and other search engines to comply when a European asks the companies to remove links in searches for their own name, if the information is old, irrelevant or infringes on their privacy.In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission closed its own probe into Google\u2019s search practices in 2013, after the company agreed to voluntary changes. That decision came despite internal recommendations by the agency\u2019s bureau of competition to bring a lawsuit challenging three Google practices. A separate report from the FTC\u2019s economic bureau didn\u2019t favor legal action.The FTC appears unlikely to restart an investigation of Google soon, in part because the commission\u2019s leadership remains uncertain and three of the five commissioner slots are vacant. Acting Chairwoman       Maureen Ohlhausen,        a Republican, voted to close much of the antitrust investigation into Google four years ago. An FTC spokesman declined to comment.Still,       Trump       administration officials have considered Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, a vocal Google critic, for the leadership post, and he has been backed by several firms opposing Google, including             Yelp Inc.,Oracle Corp.       and             News Corp,       the owner of The Wall Street Journal and an interested third party in the shopping case, meaning it can participate in the investigation. News Corp has also formally complained to the EU about Google\u2019s handling of news articles in search results. The EU doesn\u2019t have an active case/probe of Google\u2019s handling of news stories.The nominee for the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has also pledged to make international antitrust issues a priority, but his nomination is one of many awaiting confirmation from the Senate.Some U.S. senators have also been critical of Google in recent months. Sen.       Richard Blumenthal,        (D., Conn.) called on the FTC to investigate the tech giant. The EU action is the latest \u201cevidence suggesting Google has repeatedly and consistently abused international competition law,\u201d he said. \u201cHere in the United States, the FTC must confront the mounting evidence that Google is manipulating search results in anticompetitive ways and possibly running afoul of our antitrust laws.\u201dSen.       Amy Klobuchar       (D., Minn.) said Tuesday that dominant internet platforms increasingly affect users\u2019 information and shopping choices and small businesses\u2019 economic opportunities. She said she is committed to ensuring \u201cthe internet is an engine to increase economic opportunity and protect consumers in the 21st century economy.\u201dThe beneficiary of the regulatory moves in Brussels often aren\u2019t just European firms. Many of the complainants in the EU investigations into Google, for instance, are U.S. companies that have sought antitrust action in Europe after the FTC closed its investigation of Google.Yelp, Oracle, News Corp,             Expedia Inc.       and             TripAdvisor Inc.       have all filed formal complaints in some of the EU\u2019s cases against Google. And there are more unnamed U.S. companies lobbying European regulators for action, said       Luther Lowe,        Yelp\u2019s head of public policy.\u201cThe not-so-well-kept secret of this process is that U.S. companies have been doing the lion\u2019s share of the work,\u201d Mr. Lowe said in an interview. Yelp has complained that Google\u2019s use of its own user reviews in its search results, instead of those of Yelp or other user-review sites, is bad for consumers.Mr. Lowe said U.S. firms could push for action in their home country, making the case that European internet users enjoy better protections than American consumers. \u201cSuddenly the FTC or state attorneys general must be asking themselves: Why don\u2019t consumers in my state or country have those same protections?\u201d he said.\u2014Valentina Pop and Brent Kendall contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Tech Firms Feel the Heat in Europe.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 19:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-tech-firms-feel-the-heat-in-europe-1498607105", "news_title": "U.S. Tech Firms Feel the Heat in Europe ", "keywords": " alphabet ,apple, facebook,federal trade commission,google,google antitrust,google eu,margrethe vestager ,tech regulation,Apple,AAPL,European Union,Google,GOOGL,Alphabet Inc.

When you\u2019re going to attack the institution of the presidency, it\u2019s necessary to have the utmost caution and have robust evidence, proof. The charges can\u2019t be an insinuation.\u201dThe charges and the president\u2019s defiant response escalated a conflict that has raged in Brazil\u2019s capital since Mr. Batista\u2019s allegations became public in May. On one side are Mr. Temer and the mostly conservative career politicians who make up his main support base. On the other are prosecutors leading the most significant corruption purge in the country\u2019s history, allied, at the moment, with opposition legislators seeking to force a Brazilian president from office for the second time in little more than a year.The two sides will face off over the coming weeks in Congress, where two-thirds of legislators must vote to allow Mr. Temer to be put on trial before the Supreme Court for the case to go forward. If that happens, the president would be suspended from office for up to 180 days.Many analysts believe Mr. Temer currently has the political support he needs to stave off prosecution. \u201cBut new facts could emerge and change the scenario,\u201d said       Thiago Vidal,        a political scientist at Bras\u00edlia\u2019s Prospectiva consulting firm.Mr. Janot is expected to file additional charges in coming days for obstruction of justice and criminal conspiracy, a move that would force legislators to vote multiple times to save the president from prosecution. In the document released Monday, he requested permission from the Supreme Court to investigate Mr. Temer for money laundering as well.\u2018It\u2019s not those who have voted who are calling the shots anymore.\u2019Some of Mr. Temer\u2019s supporters cast the charges as an antidemocratic push by the attorney general and prosecutors. \u201cIt\u2019s not those who have voted who are calling the shots anymore,\u201d Sen. Jarder Barbalho said on Tuesday.Opposition politicians seized on the charges, ridiculing Mr. Temer for becoming the first Brazilian president ever charged with a criminal offense while in office.The distinction may be a fine one, however. President       Dilma Rousseff       was impeached last year and ousted from office on charges of manipulating the budget\u2014a move she criticized as politically motivated.\u201cResult of the 2016 coup: the country is left in the hands of the only [sitting] president charged with corruption,\u201d she said in a tweet Tuesday.\u2018I don\u2019t know how God put me here, you know, facing such a difficult task, but surely it was for me to finish it.\u2019Other former presidents, including       Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva       and       Fernando Henrique Cardoso,        have encouraged Mr. Temer to call early elections and step down before his term concludes at the end of next year.But the president and his staunchest allies say such a scenario would derail economic reforms, including an overhaul to the pension system, at a time when Brazil is emerging from its deepest recession on record.\u201cIn the year I\u2019ve been in office, we\u2019ve worked to lower inflation, to reduce interest rates, to create jobs\u2026and for the end of the recession,\u201d Mr. Temer said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how God put me here, you know, facing such a difficult task, but surely it was for me to finish it.\u201dOpposition politicians, and many analysts, argue that a successful pension reform is increasingly unlikely in light of Mr. Temer\u2019s legal troubles and 7% approval rating.\u201cThe country won\u2019t stabilize without elections. There\u2019s no way,\u201d said       Jos\u00e9 Guimar\u00e3es,        a Workers\u2019 Party congressman. \u201cYou will see when the charges land here, no lawmaker will stand up and make passionate speeches to defend Temer.\u201dThe charges against Mr. Temer are based largely on a taped conversation at the president\u2019s house in March with Mr. Batista. In it, the businessman is heard telling Mr. Temer of his various attempts to hamper investigations into his company, including by paying hush money to a jailed witness. Prosecutors say the president encouraged Mr. Batista continue the measures.\u2018I can\u2019t say for sure that he\u2019s corrupt. But he\u2019s mixed up with all those other people who are.\u2019Federal police subsequently videotaped a close aide of Mr. Temer running out of a S\u00e3o Paulo restaurant with a bag containing about $150,000 from Mr. Batista\u2019s company. Prosecutors say the aide was an intermediary and that the money was intended for the president.Mr. Temer denied ever receiving illicit money, a defense his supporters echoed.\u201cThis was a trap from Joesley Batista,\u201d said       Alfredo Kaefer,        a congressman from a small party aligned with Mr. Temer. \u201cWhat type of man records a chat with another man?\u201dFor many ordinary Brazilians, though, the meeting\u2014which took place after 10 p.m. and wasn\u2019t recorded on Mr. Temer\u2019s agenda\u2014was incriminating enough.\u201cI can\u2019t say for sure that he\u2019s corrupt,\u201d said 46-year-old Fatima Meira, an unemployed human-resources worker in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cBut he\u2019s mixed up with all those other people who are.\u201dAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Brazil Leader Rejects Calls to Quit.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 19:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-president-michel-temer-vows-to-fight-charges-1498607009", "news_title": "Brazil President Michel Temer Vows to Fight Charges ", "keywords": "brazil car wash, brazil corruption, brazil crisis , brazil politics,JBS SA ,JBSS3.BR,Michel Temer,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,bribery,political,general news,corruption,crime,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,food,beverages,tobacco,animal slaughtering,processing,meat processing,consumer goods,food products"}, {"content": "New Jersey Governor       Chris Christie       made his reputation prosecuting political corruption, but he now sees nothing unseemly about shaking down the state\u2019s largest health insurer to backfill the budget and fund new anti-opioid spending.The lame-duck Governor has given up fixing New Jersey\u2019s tax-and-spend culture, but he still hopes to achieve some success rehabilitating drug addicts. That\u2019s laudable. But since the state is short on cash, he\u2019s bludgeoning the not-for-profit Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield to pay the bill.Horizon is the state\u2019s sole health services corporation, meaning it pays state and federal taxes\u2014$543 million last year\u2014but doesn\u2019t make distributions to shareholders. The insurer covers about 3.8 million Garden State residents including 900,000 Medicaid recipients and controls about 55% of the individual market.In February Mr. Christie demanded that Horizon hand over $300 million annually of its $2.4 billion reserve to expand addiction treatment. Many states are expanding rehab programs with Medicaid funds and taxpayer dollars, and the Republican U.S. Senate health-care reform includes an additional $2 billion for opioid treatment.Mr. Christie accuses Horizon of maintaining an excessive surplus\u2014in New Jersey, any surplus appears excessive\u2014but Horizon\u2019s reserve hews to industry standards and is smaller on a risk-adjusted basis than those maintained by most state Blue Cross Blue Shield affiliates. A healthy cushion is particularly critical amid ObamaCare uncertainty. If the federal individual mandate is lifted while New Jersey maintains a guaranteed-coverage requirement, the reserve could prevent premiums from soaring.When Horizon undershot the Governor\u2019s bid by offering $135 million, Mr. Christie began targeting the insurer in terms that recall       Barack Obama\u2019s       tirade against Wellpoint for raising premiums after ObamaCare passed. Last week the state Department of Human Services, which answers to the Governor, slapped Horizon with a $15.5 million fine for mishandling Medicaid claims and misreporting its finances. Horizon disputes the charges.Now Mr. Christie is offering schools a $125 million boost if Democrats turn Horizon into a public charity. The state Senate this week is debating legislation that would give the Department of Banking and Insurance wide latitude to determine if Horizon has breached its \u201ccharitable commitment.\u201d If the state insurance commissioner deems that its reserve is \u201cinefficient,\u201d Horizon would be required to produce a plan to \u201cimprove the overall health status of all New Jersey residents\u201d that would include \u201cresponding to emerging health care issues in New Jersey\u201d like substance abuse.To add injury to insult, Democrats are also proposing to deem Horizon \u201can insurer of last resort.\u201d The designation would require the insurer to cover the state\u2019s sickest patients without compensation from other insurers or the state. Horizon would have no choice but to increase premiums to comply.Mr. Christie\u2019s raid is a tax and regulatory mugging masked as public charity. If this succeeds, is any business or nonprofit\u2014perhaps Princeton\u2019s $22 billion endowment is also excessive\u2014safe in New Jersey?Appeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-27 19:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/christies-insurance-shakedown-1498606104", "news_title": "Christie\u2019s Insurance Shakedown", "keywords": "Chris Christie,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,editorials,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "Good news: Monday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling on religious liberty was even better than we thought. The Justices ruled 7-2 that a church could not be banned from a public benefit program merely because it is a church. On Tuesday the Justices extended that principle by overturning a ruling that struck down Colorado\u2019s school voucher program on religious grounds.In 2011, Colorado\u2019s Douglas County adopted a Choice Scholarship Program to let 500 students attend a local private school. But groups including the American Civil Liberties Union sued. The Colorado Supreme Court killed the program citing the state\u2019s version of the Blaine Amendment, one of many state anti-Catholic laws from the 1800s to prevent public money from funding religious schools (      Doyle       v. Taxpayers for Public Education).The Douglas County School District and the Institute for Justice, which represents three families in Colorado, appealed to the Supreme Court in 2015, but the Justices held the petition pending the resolution of Trinity Lutheran v. Comer on Monday. On Tuesday the Court vacated and remanded Doyle to the lower court for reconsideration in keeping with Trinity Lutheran\u2019s holding that Missouri\u2019s application of the Blaine Amendment violated the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause.The High Court typically vacates and remands only when the Justices think there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the lower court got it wrong. Colorado\u2019s do-over is a warning to other states that might use Blaine Amendments to derail school choice programs that threaten teachers unions and the public school monopoly.The win comes at a good time for school choice advocates who have been building momentum in the states. In May three families successfully challenged a Montana rule that prevented a voucher program from being used at religious schools. On Monday the Georgia Supreme Court unanimously upheld a program of tax credits for scholarships to some 13,000 students to attend private schools.School choice is spreading because parents want the chance to get their child a better education than they receive in local public schools. Sometimes that enhanced opportunity is offered by religious schools, and the First Amendment does not allow the state to discriminate on the basis of religion.Judicial liberals have interpreted Monday\u2019s Trinity Lutheran ruling as applying only to school playgrounds. But in his concurrence Justice       Neil Gorsuch       wrote that the Court\u2019s playground decision should be understood broadly because jurisprudence must be governed by general principles. \u201cThe general principles here do not permit discrimination against religious exercise,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhether on the playground or anywhere else.\u201dAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-27 19:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-religious-bonus-1498605879", "news_title": "Supreme Court Religious Bonus", "keywords": "American Civil Liberties Union,political,general news,society,community,education,politics,international relations,domestic politics,private education,religion,school,government bodies,judicial branch,editorials"}, {"content": "Senate Republicans on Tuesday delayed a vote on their health-care bill until after the July 4 recess, and the timidity and opportunism of too many Senators suggest they may never get 50 GOP votes. We hope they understand that if they fail, Republicans will be entrusting their political health-care future to the brutal generosity of Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.The idea persists in some media and GOP ranks that if the Senate bill dies, this will produce a blossoming of bipartisanship. The left will have been repudiated by ObamaCare\u2019s woes, and the right by the GOP Congress\u2019s failure. Everyone can then sit down in the glorious middle and work out a compromise. It\u2019s a lovely thought\u2014like peace on Earth and the end of original sin. It is also a fantasy.If Republicans fail, Democrats will have zero political incentive to cooperate except on their policy terms. Americans know that Republicans run Congress and the White House, and that they promised to do something about the problems of ObamaCare. Do Republicans really believe voters in 2018 will blame GOP failure on the President who left town two years ago? Democrats can tell you how well that strategy worked in 2010.Then there\u2019s who Republicans would negotiate with\u2014and over what. Last week Governors       John Kasich       (R., Ohio) and       John Hickenlooper       (D., Colo.) offered a five-point bipartisan reform outline that was laughable in its lazy generalities: \u201cImprove affordability . . . Restore stability to insurance markets.\u201dWell, sure, but how? Reaching these goals requires hard policy choices on which the parties are philosophically divided. Democrats want to stabilize markets with more taxpayer money and federal rules. Republicans want to deregulate markets and let insurers offer more plans that better suit the variety of insurance consumers. Democrats want to expand Medicaid to cover ever-more Americans. Republicans, or at least most of them, want to put Medicaid on a budget to provide better coverage to the neediest.When Senate Republicans reached out to       Heidi Heitkamp       this spring to negotiate on health care, the North Dakota Democrat told Politico she had these demands: No per capita Medicaid block grants to the states and no rollback in ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. And that was merely \u201cthe price of admission for me sitting down.\u201d Ms. Heitkamp is the second most conservative Senate Democrat after West Virginia\u2019s       Joe Manchin.Ms. Heitkamp would never get a real chance to negotiate in any case. If their current effort fails, Republicans would then need 60 Senate votes to pass anything, and that gives Mr. Schumer the whip hand. His price for cooperating would include the Medicaid status quo; preserving the individual and employer mandates; tens of billions in higher subsidies to lure insurers back into the failing exchanges; and probably a limit on the policy flexibility the       Trump       Administration could allow states.Does that sound like something       Rand Paul       might support? Or       Mike Lee      ? The more conservative Republicans who defect, the more Mr. Schumer would demand in return for more Democratic votes. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would have to scramble to find even 15 Republicans to vote with Democrats as the GOP majority splinters.This is the Senate reality, not some Kasich Kumbaya circle. Republicans can either set aside their narrow self-interest and fix ObamaCare on their terms, or they can collapse in disarray and bail it out on Mr. Schumer\u2019s. In 2018 they can defend an accomplishment or try to explain away a failure.

In \u201cRadicals Chasing Utopia,\u201d the British journalist Jamie Bartlett sets out to describe and understand this new spirit of radicalism. The consensus that defines \u201c \u2018normal\u2019 political ideas,\u201d he says, has been blown apart\u2014and that\u2019s a good thing. Not everyone will agree.Mr. Bartlett provides a series of profiles of radicals in action. First up: the \u201ctranshumanists,\u201d technophiles who believe that man and machine should merge and that \u201cany rational person should spend their every waking moment on a quest to stay alive.\u201d Mr. Bartlett joins       Zoltan Istvan Gyurko,        the Los Angeles-based presidential candidate of the Transhumanist Party, as he campaigns across several states in an \u201cimmortality bus\u201d remade to look like a coffin. The trip culminates in Washington, where Zoltan posts a Transhumanist Bill of Rights on the Capitol Building. It demands government support for life extension, the elimination of physical disabilities and rights for cyborgs.It all seems a bit silly. The beat-up bus leaks oil, and Zoltan has little hope of getting on ballots, let alone winning many votes. But in Mr. Bartlett\u2019s view, the transhumanists are at least talking about the social implications of the technologies coming our way, fast, including artificial intelligence and genetic manipulation. What would happen if, as Zoltan desires, we \u201csolve\u201d the problem of aging? Soon, Mr. Bartlett argues, we won\u2019t be able to ignore such questions.Mr. Bartlett also hits the road with Pegida, an anti-Islamist organization founded in Germany in 2014 and now branching out into other European countries. Pledged to defend \u201cFortress Europe\u201d from Islamic terror and meddling continental bureaucrats alike, and often using inflammatory rhetoric, Pegida has drawn crowds of 30,000 to its demonstrations in Germany. Chancellor       Angela Merkel       has denounced the group as having \u201chatred\u201d in its heart, yet Mr. Bartlett finds the Pegida members he meets in Britain and Denmark to be multiracial, polite and capable of saying things that, \u201con the face of it, were explicitly anti-fascist.\u201d At one Pegida rally that Mr. Bartlett attends, it\u2019s the left-wing activists protesting the event who ignite violence.By Jamie Bartlett  Nation Books, 390 pages, $18.99Pegida is woefully misguided, in Mr. Bartlett\u2019s view. In part, he blames the \u201cself-reinforcing bubbles\u201d of social media for the group\u2019s exaggerated sense of the Islamist threat and for its belief that the Muslim faith and a free society are incompatible. But he concedes that the movement has raised genuine concerns about immigration and terrorism levels that most European political parties haven\u2019t been addressing.Pegida\u2019s ideas have become increasingly mainstream, Mr. Bartlett notes. A strong believer in the threat of climate change, he wishes that environmental activists could be as effective. Of all the movements vying for attention these days, he says, \u201cclimate-change activism has arguably the most persuasive casus belli.\u201d He participates in an illegal direct-action occupation of the U.K.\u2019s largest coal mine but sees it as a largely symbolic gesture. Without mass support, putting the fossil-fuel industry out of business is a fantasy, he concedes, however popular green causes may be among entertainers, journalists and professors.What makes winning broad democratic backing unlikely, Mr. Bartlett says, is the \u201cactivists\u2019 paradox\u201d: the tendency of radical groups to create powerful subcultures that can be off-putting to the unconverted. In the case of the greens with whom he is protesting, they\u2019re mostly white, college-educated and similarly attired, and they share a range of insider references and practices, including wiggling fingers to signal agreement in group meetings. \u201cYou might have heard it expressed like this,\u201d Mr. Bartlett writes: \u201cI\u2019m all for the environment, but those eco-warriors are weird.\u201d\u201cRadicals Chasing Utopia\u201d introduces us to other colorful characters. We meet the Tamerians, residents of a back-to-nature village in the Portuguese countryside, started in the 1990s by a German psychoanalyst and his partner, a self-declared medium. Mr. Bartlett finds the group\u2019s free love, communal child rearing and animal whispering too cultish but commends its eco-friendly Stirling engines and solar batteries. He details the dramatic success of Italy\u2019s populist Five Star Movement, established by the comedian       Beppe Grillo       in 2009 to protest political corruption and now the second-largest party in the country. And he hangs out with the libertarian optimists who want to found the Free Republic of Liberland, located in a (currently) uninhabited swamp on the Croatian side of the Danube. Throughout, Mr. Bartlett is a friendly guide, with a reporter\u2019s eye for detail and a willingness to engage with his subjects.Citizens of liberal democracies should listen to radicals, Mr. Bartlett says, because \u201cthey might be right,\u201d and radicalism \u201cis the source of new ideas, renewal and change.\u201d This can be true, as the American civil-rights movement showed. But an equally important reason to listen, Mr. Bartlett thinks, is that radicals might be wrong, which is also instructive. He even suggests that free societies should accept in their midst radical Islamists, whose hatred of democracy can give \u201clife and meaning to the arguments in defence of individual liberty.\u201dIt\u2019s a noble claim, but too sanguine. The liberal-democratic idea has achieved freedoms and widespread prosperity wherever it has taken root. From its inception, though, it has had fierce critics who have despised it for its messy political compromises and its supposed spiritual emptiness. These critics have dreamed of futures beyond conventional liberties, beyond bourgeois values, and they have inflicted enormous harm on decent societies in the name of their utopias. We should remember this lesson of history, especially now.Mr. Anderson is the editor of the Manhattan Institute\u2019s City Journal and the author of \u201cDemocratic Capitalism and Its Discontents.\u201dAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'A Parade Of Discontent.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 19:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/they-think-we-can-do-better-1498605512", "news_title": "They Think We Can Do Better", "keywords": "book review,books,political,general news,society,community,arts,entertainment,social issues,reviews"}, {"content": "My 16-year-old son loves to read as much as I do, but unlike me, he prefers to savor his nonfiction and novels on an electronic reader. Although I\u2019m thrilled when any young person enjoys reading regardless of format, I wonder if my teenager is missing out on the joys of used books.This came to mind recently when I attended a used-book sale. I go every year, and I often spot complete sets of Dickens,       Twain       or       Poe       labeled with the personal library seals of their former owners. When I find several volumes from the same donor, I can\u2019t help but wonder if a household bookshelf has been emptied, perhaps because someone died or moved into a nursing home. I\u2019ve come to regard the hints of personal history in these books as a sheltering presence, like lingering in an old church for an hour or two.This year, for three bucks, I took home a first-edition copy of the American anthropologist       Loren Eiseley\u2019s       1975 memoir, \u201cAll the Strange Hours.\u201d The first page bore an inscription: \u201cTo Gar. Christmas 1976. From Mickey.\u201d\u201cGar\u201d sounded like a nickname, which made me feel as if I were eavesdropping on an intimate conversation. Within the fourth chapter, I found a longer message from Mickey, written in cursive on a yellowing sheet of loose-leaf paper: \u201cGar\u2014I ended up having to send you my very own copy (still crackling new) of this because, believe it or not, I haven\u2019t been able to get to the bookstore to get you a copy. Getting ready to wrap it for you, I started reading parts of it again. I know you will enjoy reading every page of it. Have a nice Christmas. Hope to see you soon. Greetings also to Peggy. Love, Mick.\u201dSecondhand books remind me that the world of reading spans time as readers reach across the years to shake hands with each other. Eiseley isn\u2019t read much today, but before his death in 1977, he was a big deal. His books sold well and were eagerly anticipated, which Mickey\u2019s note conveys. My vintage copy of \u201cAll the Strange Hours\u201d had landed me in a yuletide some four decades ago, when       Jimmy Carter       had just defeated       Gerald Ford       for the presidency, and readers raw from raging inflation and Watergate would surely have found respite in reading a naturalist\u2019s memoir.In \u201c84,       Charing Cross       Road,\u201d       Helene Hanff       celebrated old books as torches passed between generations. \u201cI do love secondhand books that open to the page some previous owner read oftenest,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe day Hazlitt came he opened to \u2018I hate to read new books,\u2019 and I hollered \u2018Comrade!\u2019 to whoever owned it before me.\u201dLike Hanff, I\u2019ve opened old books and found some path a prior pilgrim has worn through the text. In my tattered copy of       Virginia Woolf\u2019s       \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own,\u201d a reader I\u2019ll never know penciled \u201cintegrity\u201d throughout one chapter, inviting me to consider to what degree that single word might summarize Woolf\u2019s sensibility.I\u2019ve been thinking about how I might extend my own greeting to some future soul through the books I\u2019ll leave behind, as I turn each page of my old Eiseley, hoping, as I always do when I read, to touch the eternal.Mr. Heitman, a columnist for the Advocate in Baton Rouge, La., is author of \u201cA Summer of Birds:       John James Audubon       at Oakley House.\u201dAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-27 19:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-secondhand-book-is-a-3-time-machine-1498605454", "news_title": "A Secondhand Book Is a $3 Time Machine", "keywords": "books,reading,secondhand books,used books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "The fate of the Affordable Care Act may be determined this week, and no one can claim ignorance of the stakes. Republican leaders in the Senate drafted their proposed replacement, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, behind closed doors without hearings or committee consideration. But the Congressional has pierced the Orwellian packaging to make clear the consequences of the coming vote. Senators cannot say they weren\u2019t warned, and neither can the American people. Here are the highlights:If the BCRA becomes law, 22 million fewer people will be insured by 2026 relative to current law\u2014about the same reduction as the American Health Care Act passed by the House\u2014increasing the uninsured total by about 75%. The BCRA does more than repeal the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion; it changes the structure and funding of the entire program. Spending on Medicaid would be reduced by $772 billion\u201426%\u2014below the current baseline over the next decade. As a result, 15 million would lose their coverage under Medicaid, which is the main safety net for poor and near-poor Americans as well as for the elderly in nursing homes.Subsidies for health insurance purchased on the individual market would be cut by $408 billion, reducing participation by a projected seven million. The benchmark insurance plan under the BCRA would cover, on average, 58% of health-care costs, down from 70%. This means much higher deductibles. Because the BCRA allows insurance companies to charge older Americans five times as much as young adults, up from only three times as much under current law, people 50 to 64 would be hit especially hard. For those in this age bracket making $30,000 a year or less, the share without insurance coverage would more than double, from about 12% to 26%.The Republican mantras of \u201cflexibility\u201d and \u201cchoice\u201d can no longer conceal the underlying reality: Cutting public support for health care by $1.2 trillion over the next decade means depriving vast numbers of Americans of health security. These people would be forced to rely on the kindness of strangers. They would turn to small-town and rural hospitals that already run on thin margins. Hospitals that cannot absorb the costs of uncompensated care will shut down, worsening the already serious shortage of health care in sparsely populated regions, which voted overwhelmingly for       Donald Trump       in 2016.Twenty-one Republican senators represent 14 states that have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. This June, the Urban Institute estimated the effects of the AHCA, which BCRA closely resembles, on insurance coverage. To help these senators\u2019 hard-pressed staffs, let me summarize the Urban Institute\u2019s findings:Alaska\u2019s       Dan Sullivan       and       Lisa Murkowski      : 18,000 of your state\u2019s residents would lose health coverage.

West Virginia\u2019s       Shelley Moore Capito      : 195,000.Some Republican voters may like that the BCRA lowers taxes on manufacturers and high-income people by $541 billion over a decade. But I wonder how many GOP senators will present this spreadsheet, showing massive reductions in coverage, to their constituents during the July 4 break.As Speaker       Paul Ryan       might say, there is a better way: scrap this entire approach and write a new bipartisan bill. Last week Republican Gov.       John Kasich       of Ohio and Democratic Gov.       John Hickenlooper       of Colorado offered a roadmap. \u201cAs governors from opposite sides of the political aisle, we feel that true and lasting reforms are best approached by finding common ground,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAll Americans will come out on the losing end if we simply replace one divisive plan with another.\u201dThis week a bipartisan group of health-care experts, represented by       Lanhee Chen       of the conservative Hoover Institution and       Ron Pollack       of the liberal Families USA, presented their consensus in an op-ed for this newspaper. Messrs. Chen and Pollack suggested means-tested subsidies for low-income Americans, \u201creasonable limits\u201d on the tax-exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance, \u201ccarefully developed state testing\u201d as a \u201cprimary engine\u201d for Medicaid reform, and increased flexibility for states, subject to \u201csafeguards\u201d to prevent funds intended to help the poor from being diverted up the income scale or for other purposes. Overall, they wrote that these \u201cincremental policies\u201d would \u201chelp families of limited means secure the care they need.\u201dIf Republicans are serious about improving health care rather than scoring ideological points at their constituents\u2019 expense, this is the path they will pursue.Appeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-27 19:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tear-up-the-gop-health-bill-and-start-over-1498605433", "news_title": "Tear Up the GOP Health Bill and Start Over", "keywords": "health care,health care bill,health care exchanges,health care reform,health insurance,medicaid,medicare,Bill Cassidy,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "America faces an urgent crisis in its health-care system. Costs are skyrocketing and choices are disappearing on the individual and small-group markets. Many people now confront the real challenge of having no choice in their health coverage.One of them is       Doug Lake,        an Iowa radiologist who came to the White House last week to share his story. His daughter, who suffers from a rare cardiac condition, is covered by an insurer that plans to pull out of ObamaCare\u2019s exchange in their state next year. Only one insurer remains in their county, and that company has requested a 43% increase in premiums.The situation is even worse elsewhere. As of this week, 49 counties across the country do not have a single insurer offering plans on the exchanges next year.This year more than 1,000 counties had only one insurer in the ObamaCare market, meaning millions of Americans had no meaningful choice. Meanwhile, the insurers that did stay in the market increased premiums for their midlevel plans by an average of 25%. Premiums on the individual market are up about $3,000 since ObamaCare was implemented. Think about what else that money could buy!It is too early to know how much premiums will rise next year, but reports so far indicate that double-digit increases again will be the norm.These are not simply numbers on a page: They represent real people with real stories, facing real health-care and financial crises.Dudley Bostic,        a pharmacy owner in Tennessee, can no longer afford to provide health insurance for her employees because of ObamaCare\u2019s mandates.       Candace Fowler,        a Missouri homemaker who was recently diagnosed with a serious neurological condition, lives in a county where there are slated to be no insurers selling ObamaCare plans next year.       Tommie McClain,        a student in Clinton, Mo., who suffers from chronic migraines, faces the possibility of zero choices in his county, too.The good news is that Congress has the chance to help Doug, Dudley, Candace, Tommie and the millions of other Americans suffering under this law by undoing the damage done by ObamaCare and fulfilling the promises President Trump has made.The bill recently introduced in the Senate would get rid of the individual mandate, which in 2015 alone caused 6.5 million Americans to pay $3 billion in penalties to the IRS because they did not want or could not afford a government-dictated health plan. It would directly repeal some of ObamaCare\u2019s most costly regulations while giving states flexibility to waive others if they develop innovative ways to provide coverage and bring down costs.The Senate\u2019s plan also would repeal hundreds of billions of dollars in onerous taxes. It would put Medicaid on a sustainable spending path and give states a real chance to reform the program to make it work for the people who rely on it.The Trump administration, recognizing the need for urgent action, began offering Americans relief from ObamaCare starting in February. The Department of Health and Human Services has reviewed thousands of pages of ObamaCare rules and taken more than a dozen distinct actions, with additional positive steps in the works.But administrative action is constrained by the failed law Americans all live under. If Congress acts this summer, the Trump administration will have significantly expanded ability to offer relief, and the country will have taken a huge step toward truly patient-centered health care.Under ObamaCare, insurers are either running for the exit doors or proposing huge premium increases. Americans instead deserve a market where companies clamor to offer competitive plans to as many customers as they can.

You\u2019ve promised to rebuild America\u2019s crumbling roads, bridges and airports, and you\u2019ve proposed to privatize air-traffic control. Now privatize the interstate highway system, including all those bridges in need of repair and major upgrading.The stimulus programs of 2008-09 both fell short of their promise to rebuild. And how many times do we have to learn that the gasoline tax, intended exclusively for highway construction and maintenance, isn\u2019t used that way? The government keeps failing even to fill potholes and resurface bumpy roads.But the richly interconnected highway network really could be auctioned. Between major highway intersections there are alternative routes that could be auctioned to different bidders, assuring drivers of a choice of toll roads, along with state and local freeway alternatives. That competition would keep tolls affordable.Perhaps most important, surface transportation rights of way would be opened to new mass-transit innovations at a time when driverless vehicles are making their entrance. A few autobahns might also compete more effectively with short- to medium-haul airline routes, but you will need to resist airline opposition.You should also consider auctioning off the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s extensive grazing lands. Better incentives through ownership, or long-term leases, mean better stewardship and innovation. But neighboring farmers and ranchers won\u2019t like the impact on their land prices.How could you use the money from highway and land sales to benefit all Americans\u2014and improve your own popularity? By creating a new Permanent Citizens Fund, invested in stocks, bonds and real estate world-wide. Every citizen would hold an equal share, with annual dividends paid in cash.Better highways, more land for productive development plus a permanent fund sending checks to every citizen. A guaranteed basic income financed from public assets waiting to be monetized and put to work. You might even get the progressives\u2019 vote. Have you ever made such a great deal?If you think it\u2019s pie in the sky, ask an Alaskan. The Alaska Permanent Fund, initiated in 1976 to distribute oil revenue, has a market value I estimate at $72,000 for each Alaskan citizen. Annual dividends began in 1982, when the public corporation that administers the fund cut the first checks for $1,000. Little wonder that Alaska is second among all the states in income equality.After highways, bridges and federal acreage, your next project would be to start auctioning all U.S. mineral, oil and gas resource rights for deposit to the fund.

Yet the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.198% on Tuesday, below the 2.269% where it settled before the Fed\u2019s first rate increase since 2006. Yields fall as bond prices rise.The tension reminds some investors of the \u201cconundrum\u201d described by Alan Greenspan, then Fed chairman, in February 2005. Mr. Greenspan was puzzled by long-term Treasury yields that were ticking lower despite increases in the federal-funds target rate.\u201cI think it\u2019s part of the same conundrum, maybe just a bond-market conundrum redux,\u2019\u2019 said       Michael Collins,        senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income.Resolving that quandary is key to investors and Fed policy makers because of concerns the central bank\u2019s moves to normalize interest rates could dent the economic expansion, already the third longest in U.S. history. Some worry it could also affect asset-allocation strategies at a time when many are concerned that stock valuations could be stretched.If low interest rates push investors into excessive risk-taking, the \u00a0Fed may need to tighten monetary policy more drastically, a scenario that could cause a sharp pullback in stocks and other riskier assets and raise the threat of a U.S. recession, some investors said.Recently,       Eric Rosengren,        president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said that the era of low rates in the U.S. and elsewhere poses financial-stability risks. And Fed Vice Chairman       Stanley Fischer       said the world \u201ccannot afford another pair of crises of the magnitude of the Great Recession and the global financial crisis.\u201dFed officials don\u2019t want to see a sharp rise in bond yields either, some analysts said. The 10-year Treasury yield is a benchmark for global finance, so a big rise would push up long-term borrowing costs for consumers and businesses and tighten financial conditions sharply, a scenario central bankers are trying to avoid, several said.The Fed\u2019s conundrum is partly a result of investors\u2019 confusion about how to respond to the central bank\u2019s plans, which also include paring back its large balance sheet later this year.Yields have risen on short-term government debt, which is more sensitive to the central bank\u2019s policy outlook. But yields on long-term debt are influenced by a variety of factors, including the economic and inflation outlook in both the U.S. and abroad.In previous tightening cycles, a popular trade was to sell short-term debt and put money into long-term bonds, betting on the gap between the two yields to fall, which is known as a flattening yield curve. The 10-year Treasury\u2019s premium relative to the two-year note is trading near the lowest level since 2007.But some investors are concerned that this trade may be getting crowded and could be vulnerable to a reversal if the Fed surprises investors with an aggressive approach in unwinding its balance sheet.That balance-sheet reduction could push up the term premium for the 10-year note, say some analysts and investors. The term premium is the extra compensation investors demand to hold the 10-year Treasury note instead of buying a series of shorter-term debt over the next 10 years.The premium has fallen below zero since March, a sign of heightened demand for the 10-year note. The premium traded at around negative 0.4% on June 23, according to the latest data from the New York Fed\u2019s website, near a record low of negative 0.77% in July 2016, when the 10-year yield closed at a record low of 1.366%.Some money managers said the Fed\u2019s slow and cautious approach could reduce the chances of a repeat of the 2013 \u201ctaper tantrum,\u201d when the bond market was spooked by then Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke\u2019s comment in May 2013 over a possible cut in bond purchases.Several said they planned to wait for the actual implementation of the Fed\u2019s balance-sheet reduction before making wagers on the yield curve.\"The old playbook may not work,\u2019\u2019 said       Jason Evans,        co-founder of hedge fund NineAlpha Capital LP.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'A Bond-Investing Conundrum Returns.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 19:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-bond-investing-conundrum-returns-1498605010", "news_title": "A Bond-Investing Conundrum Returns ", "keywords": "federal reserve,u.s. government bonds,Federal Reserve,Eric Rosengren,Stanley Fischer,Jason Evans,Michael Collins,economic performance,indicators,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "The political wreckage from       Theresa May\u2019s       election gambit keeps growing.

By 2016, BLM activists were being hosted by President       Obama       and disrupting campaign events for       Hillary Clinton       and       Bernie Sanders.       Today, major news organizations such as National Public Radio and the Washington Post turn to BLM representatives for comment on race-related stories.An obituary for a movement that has become so prominent so fast seems premature, but a recent BuzzFeed article that included interviews with dozens of BLM-linked activists was pessimistic about the group\u2019s future. Factions have formed, infighting is common and objectives are unclear. \u201cBlack Lives Matter is still here. Its groups are still organizing. But Black Lives Matter is on the verge of losing the traction and momentum that sparked a national shift on criminal justice policy,\u201d wrote reporter       Darren Sands.       And \u201cactivists largely agreed that the identity of the movement, its existential purpose and aim, remains unresolved.\u201dSome BLM leaders want to integrate political institutions further. Others want the organization to expand its focus to immigrants\u2019 rights. Still others want to create a society \u201cfree from pain being inflicted on it by police, racist structures, and capitalism.\u201d Apparently, there are places in the world where blacks living in noncapitalist societies are thriving in comparison with their U.S. brethren.On a certain level, the decision by BLM activists to single out policing as a major obstacle to black advancement has always defied comprehension. Police shootings have fallen dramatically in recent decades. In New York City, for example, cops shot 314 people in 1971, 93 of them fatally. In 2015, New York police shot 23 people, killing eight. Which means that police shootings and fatalities in the nation\u2019s most populous city have declined by more than 90% over the past 4\u00bd decades. A 2016 paper released by Harvard economist       Roland Fryer       examined the use of force by police since 2000 in some of the country\u2019s largest urban areas and found that \u201cblacks are 23.8 percent less likely to be shot at by police relative to whites.\u201dIn theory, there is no reason these activists couldn\u2019t play a more useful role in helping blacks overcome obstacles and take advantage of opportunities that were unavailable to previous generations. But that would mean abandoning nonsensical narratives that scapegoat law enforcement for high black crime rates and instead picking more substantive fights with fellow progressives.Why not side with the hundreds of thousands of black children nationwide who linger on waiting lists for charter schools that have a proven record of narrowing the achievement gap? Why side with progressive politicians who stunt the growth of charters out of deference to powerful teachers unions that oppose school choice?A University of Illinois at Chicago paper released earlier this month reports that 85% of black teenagers in Chicago are out of work, versus 73.4% of whites. Among 20- to 24-year-olds, the black jobless rate is 60%, or more than double the rate for comparable whites. In 2014, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel approved legislation that raises the minimum wage in increments by more than 57% by 2018. Studies have long shown that younger and less experienced workers are particularly sensitive to rises in the wage floor. And even minimum-wage hikes that don\u2019t put people out of work can leave them worse off.A new National Bureau of Economic Research report looked at the consequences of Seattle\u2019s decision to raise its minimum wage to $13 last year from $9.47 in 2015. The researchers concluded that the increase \u201creduced hours worked in low-wage jobs by around 9 percent, while hourly wages in such jobs increased by around 3 percent. Consequently, total payroll fell for such jobs, implying that the minimum wage ordinance lowered low-wage employees\u2019 earnings by an average of $125 per month in 2016.\u201d When are BLM activists going to take the Democrats to task for promoting policies that harm minority workers disproportionately? When the unemployment rate for black teens reaches 100%?Of course, improving educational and employment prospects for the black underclass would lower black crime rates and thus go a long way toward reducing encounters with police, the goal that is so near and dear to the Black Lives Matter movement. It\u2019s a win-win, but first the activists have to decide whether the real goal is to help black people or to help themselves.Appeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-27 19:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-better-direction-for-black-lives-matter-1498604674", "news_title": "A Better Direction for Black Lives Matter", "keywords": "black crime rates,black employment,black lives matter,black unemployment,blm,Black Lives Matter movement,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,workers pay,political,general news,crime,legal action,murder,manslaughter,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "House Republicans have delayed the rollout of their budget for the 2018 fiscal year until after members return from a July 4 recess, according to lawmakers and aides, amid continuing negotiations over proposed mandatory spending cuts.House Republicans are close to wrapping up a deal that would set base military spending at $621.5 billion, surpassing the $549 billion limit under current law, House GOP aides said earlier this week. They are likely to set nonmilitary spending at $511 billion, which is below the limit of $516 billion under current law. The new fiscal year begins in October.Lawmakers said the biggest remaining issue was how big a mandatory spending cut they want to lock themselves into in the budget document. The budget blueprint is needed to allow them to pass an overhaul of the tax code without Democratic support, through a process called reconciliation.Budget Committee Chairwoman       Diane Black       (R., Tn.) said Tuesday that the committee is working hard and is \u201cvery close\u201d to a budget resolution, but she wouldn\u2019t say when it would release the finished product.\u201cThere are a lot of moving pieces, this is a little bit of a different budget than we have traditionally seen,\u201d Ms. Black said. \u201dWe are adamant that we are going to get a budget, we\u2019re going to get a budget to the committee and we\u2019re going to get a budget to the floor.\u201dThe committee had planned to release and adopt the budget resolution later this week, but lawmakers said they learned Monday night that the process would be pushed back until after the July 4 recess as negotiations continue.Rep.       Tom McClintock       (R., Calif.), a member of the House Budget Committee, said the budget would be considered in July once lawmakers had finished their deliberations.\u201cWe come to a decision when we\u2019re tired of talking and we\u2019re not tired of talking yet,\u201d he said.The budget resolution is largely a symbolic document, but it carries particular significance this year because Republicans plan to use it as a tool to advance their tax overhaul legislation without Democratic support.If you set goals that are too ambitious and can\u2019t reach them, \u201cthen you blow up reconciliation if you don\u2019t get there,\u201d said Rep.       Steve Womack       (R., Ark.)The spending levels in the budget resolution are likely to change, but other directions could eventually become law. For example, Republicans are planning to include instructions to shave off at least $200 billion over a decade from mandatory spending, including major safety-net programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps.Ms. Black said no decisions had yet been made on what those cuts would look like, adding that \u201cthe numbers may move around a little bit.\u201dA GOP aide close to the budget process said the committee is still trying to determine how to allocate the proposed mandatory spending cuts across the committees that will write spending bills to implement them.

Nowhere in the Post\u2019s lengthy tick-tock is Mr. Obama presented with evidence of, or described as worried about, Trump collusion with Russia.Moscow intervened in the election eight ways from Sunday, but it\u2019s clearer than ever that what\u2019s occupied Americans for the past six months are baseless accusations about the Trump campaign.Among the evidence on Mr. Obama\u2019s desk was proof that       Vladimir Putin       was personally directing the Russian espionage effort. For a variety of sensible reasons, though, the White House and U.S. intelligence also concluded that Russia\u2019s meddling was \u201cunlikely to materially affect the outcome of the election.\u201dPresident Obama made at least one inevitably political calculation:       Hillary Clinton       was going to win, so he would keep relatively mum on Russian interference to avoid provoking \u201cescalation from Putin\u201d or \u201cpotentially contaminating the expected Clinton triumph,\u201d in the Post\u2019s words.Strangely missing from the Post account, however, is one Russian intervention, revealed by the paper\u2019s own earlier reporting, that may really have, in farcical fashion, elected Donald Trump.This was FBI Director       James Comey\u2019s       ill-fated decision to clear Hillary Clinton publicly on intelligence-mishandling charges. His choice, it now appears, was partly shaped by a false intelligence document referring to a nonexistent Democratic email purporting to confirm that then-Attorney General       Loretta Lynch       had vowed to quash any Hillary charges.On April 23, the             New York Times                   first alluded to the document\u2019s existence in an 8,000-word story about Mr. Comey\u2019s intervention.On May 24, the Post provided a detailed description of the document and revealed that many in the FBI considered it \u201cbad intelligence,\u201d possibly a Russian plant.On May 26, CNN adumbrated that Mr. Comey \u201cknew that a critical piece of information relating to the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email was fake\u2014created by Russian intelligence\u2014but he feared that if it became public it would undermine the probe and the Justice Department itself.\u201d\u201cIn at least one classified session [before Congress],\u201d CNN added, \u201cComey cited that intelligence as the primary reason he took the unusual step of publicly announcing the end of the Clinton email probe. .\u00a0.\u00a0. Comey did not even mention the other reason he gave in public testimony for acting independently of the Justice Department\u2014that Lynch was compromised because       Bill Clinton       boarded her plane and spoke to her during the investigation.\u201dWhy has this apparently well-documented, and eminently documentable, episode fallen down the memory hole, in favor of a theory for which there is no evidence, of collusion by the outsider Mr. Trump?The alternative history is incalculable, but consider: If Mr. Comey had followed established practice, the Hillary investigation would have been closed without an announcement, or the conflicted Ms. Lynch or an underling would have cleared Mrs. Clinton. How would this have played with voters and the media? Would the investigation\u2019s reopening in the race\u2019s final days, with discovery of the Weiner laptop, have taken place? Would the reopening have become public knowledge?The noisy, obnoxious ways Russia meddled amounted to nothing. The public was able to discount them. It was only through a bumptious act of our own law-enforcement community, in a way the public didn\u2019t know at the time may have been influenced by planted Russian intelligence, that the Kremlin conceivably really may have affected an extraordinarily close race in the Electoral College.What also emerges from the Post\u2019s tick-tock, as well as from public testimony by U.S. intelligence chiefs, is that Russia did not seek to hide its meddling. The Russian goal was to sow confusion and bring disrepute on the U.S. leadership class. If so, any investigation of Russian meddling that fails to focus on the Comey actions will amount to a coverup.Expect a coverup: The truth is absolutely unacceptable to the establishment that Special Counsel       Robert Mueller       represents. There is no appetite for the truth among Democrats: They cling to Mr. Comey\u2019s legal exoneration of Mrs. Clinton in the server matter.There is no appetite among Republicans: Messrs. Comey and Mueller are Republicans, promoted in their careers by Republican presidents. There is no appetite in the Trump White House, which doesn\u2019t want its win tainted in history by a Russian dirty trick.There is no appetite in the Kremlin: Mr. Putin knows that relations with the American superpower are slipping toward an all-out hostility that he can\u2019t afford.In the U.S., to acknowledge the truth would be to complete the task Russia set itself in discrediting the U.S. leadership class.A coverup is the only way to go.Appeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-27 19:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/expect-a-coverup-1498604425", "news_title": "Expect a Coverup", "keywords": "donald trump,election 2016,james comey,russia,russian interference in the election,vladimir putin,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Justice       Neil Gorsuch       early on has lined up consistently with the Supreme Court\u2019s most conservative justices, much as President Donald Trump promised.Justice Gorsuch didn\u2019t join the court until April, after the justices had already conducted much of their business this term, which began last October.

There may be issues down the line where he diverges from other conservative justices, but such issues haven\u2019t come up yet, Mr. Amar said.Given the new justice\u2019s lengthy record as a federal appeals court judge, \u201cI don\u2019t think there are many surprises,\u201d said       Leonard Leo,        executive vice president of the Federalist Society, who advised Mr. Trump on Justice Gorsuch\u2019s selection.The new justice already is showing his commitment to deciding cases by sticking closely to the text of statutes, \u201cand he is very skeptical of an overly expansive judicial role,\u201d Mr. Leo said.Justice Gorsuch on several early occasions has framed his opinions as exemplifying judicial restraint. In his one majority opinion, which was unanimous, the new justice wrote that companies that purchase debts aren\u2019t subject to provisions of a consumer-protection law when seeking to collect on their own behalf.If changes in the law, which was designed to rein in the \u201crepo man\u201d and other third-party collectors, need to be made to address the advent of a new industry that purchases debt to collect for itself, \u201cthese are matters for Congress, not this court, to resolve,\u201d Justice Gorsuch wrote.His first dissent came in a case that examined which court is the proper home for an appeal when federal employees are raising both civil-service claims and discrimination claims. Justice Gorsuch said the Census Bureau worker who brought the case was asking the court \u201cto tweak a congressional statute\u2014just a little\u2014so that it might (he says) work a bit more efficiently. No doubt his invitation is well meaning. But it is one we should decline all the same.\u201dJustice       Ruth Bader Ginsburg,        who wrote the court\u2019s 7-2 opinion, sided with the worker\u2019s approach, suggesting Justice Gorsuch\u2019s formalistic reading of the law was at odds with practical realities.\u00a0The worker \u201casks us not to tweak the statute, but to read it sensibly,\u201d Justice Ginsburg wrote.Justice Thomas was the one other member of the court to side with Justice Gorsuch in the case, and the two have been almost perfectly aligned so far. Both are committed textualists and proponents of originalism, a legal method that attempts to interpret the Constitution according to the text\u2019s original meaning. Justice Antonin Scalia, whom Justice Gorsuch replaced, embraced a similar approach.Among the other instances when the two joined forces, both Justices Thomas and Gorsuch in May wanted to take up a campaign-finance challenge to the limits on the use of soft-money donations. The court turned it down.There was much debate during Justice Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation hearings about whether he would go to bat for the so-called little guy. Senate Democrats questioned whether he would, while the nominee insisted that he applied the law faithfully, ruling for everyday men and women when they had the better argument.The new justice went his own way in a pair of cases Monday, both of which were arguably of the little-guy variety. In one, he objected to the court\u2019s announcement that it wouldn\u2019t consider a case about the competence of Department of Veterans Affairs medical examiners who render opinions against veterans seeking compensation for disabilities.In another, he expressed concerns for a drug defendant who may \u201clinger longer in prison\u201d after he was wrongly given a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence under a now-defunct statute.Despite Justice Gorsuch\u2019s flurry of activity early on the high court, legal observers said it would take time to discern his place on the court spectrum.\u201cIt\u2019s too early to make definitive judgments about anything,\u201d said Adam Charnes of Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP, a former law clerk to Justice       Anthony Kennedy.       \u201cThere are hints,\u201d Mr. Charnes said, \u201cbut a new justice can take several years to find their voice and their place on the court.\u201dWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com and Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Gorsuch Shows Promise for The Right.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 19:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-neil-gorsuch-leans-conservative-fulfilling-expectations-1498604442", "news_title": "Justice Neil Gorsuch Leans Conservative, Fulfilling Expectations", "keywords": "Neil Gorsuch,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "Leading congressional Republicans have lately been working to scale back the President\u2019s plan to cut taxes. They don\u2019t seem to appreciate how much markets expect it and the economy needs it.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been doing yeoman\u2019s work in trying to move a rewrite of ObamaCare, which includes a tax cut of roughly $700 billion. But when it comes to the more significant tax reform that is supposed to occur after a health insurance vote, Mr. McConnell told Bloomberg last month that the plan has to be revenue-neutral. Unless he can persuade Republican colleagues to support spending reductions, this means that he\u2019s determined to raise other taxes to offset the ones he\u2019s going to cut.Now along comes Senate Finance Committee Chairman       Orrin Hatch      telling Fox Business that instead of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to cut the corporate income tax rate to 15% from 35%, a corporate rate as high as 25% would make the country \u201cturn around overnight.\u201d That\u2019s debatable, especially if he agrees with Mr. McConnell and decides to offset the rate cut by limiting deductions as a way to keep tax collections right on Beltway schedule.Take a federal rate as high as 25% and add state levies and you have a total corporate income tax rate in the U.S. of close to 30%. According to KPMG, that would still be nearly nine percentage points higher than the average in Asia and ten points above the European average. That doesn\u2019t look like a game-changer.Some senators had been hoping they could blame the House Freedom Caucus for killing a big tax cut. But as much as House conservatives oppose deficit spending, they realize that the economy will never be able to generate the cash to pay Washington\u2019s unfunded liabilities without faster growth.And U.S. equity prices strongly suggest that investors are expecting faster growth in the future. By most historical measures, stocks are not cheap. The Journal\u2019s Lev Borodovsky highlights a chart from             Bank of America                   showing that U.S. stock market capitalization is near a record high as a percentage of GDP. As of Monday the Dow Jones Industrial Average index traded at more than 20 times trailing earnings while the S&P 500 stood at more than 24.The Journal\u2019s Jason Zweig explains that, partly due to the regulatory burdens of being a public company, there are now fewer than half as many U.S. stocks as there were 20 years ago. And among those that remain, it\u2019s not easy to find a bargain. Mr. Zweig writes:It\u2019s a reasonable expectation. Markets fluctuate, as Ace Greenberg famously said when asked to explain the 1987 stock crash. This is not to say that tax cuts should be done simply to meet investor expectations and prevent market declines, although preventing Americans from becoming poorer is a reasonable goal of public policy.Whether or not they own any stocks, workers are still waiting for the breakout from the Obama pattern of slow economic growth and job creation. The Journal\u2019s Paul Vigna observes:The drop was largely driven by aircraft orders, which can be volatile. But Mr. Vigna notes that nondefense capital goods orders excluding aircraft didn\u2019t look so hot either:It\u2019s time for Republican legislators to think bigger when it comes to tax-cut legislation. Workers need it, investors want it, and we finally have a President who will sign it.***Bottom Stories of the DayRetraction, And Now This  \u201cNew O\u2019Keefe video shows CNN producer calling Russia coverage \u2018mostly bull----\u2019,\u201d The Hill, June 27Another Housing Bubble?  \u201cThe McMansion, ultimate symbol of the pre-recession boom, is back,\u201d             Chicago Tribune,June 26Questions Nobody Is Asking  \u201cWhat Does It Mean To Be a Hamburger?,\u201d Der Spiegel, June 26Justice Garland  \u201cWhere Would We Be Politically If       Hillary Clinton       Had Won?,\u201d New York, June 23Hey There, Tough Guy  \u201cThe \u2018Progressive Liberal\u2019 Is Maybe The Perfect Wrestling Heel,\u201d Deadspin, June 26***On the Steps of St. James\u2019sBereft of the Web,We wait for our daily alms\u2014A small piece of \u201cBest\u201d.-- Myles C.

The justices\u2019 unanimous ruling in Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project upholds both the integrity of the judiciary and the Supreme Court\u2019s own authority.The case came to the justices from two federal appellate courts. They had upheld trial judges\u2019 orders halting enforcement of President Trump\u2019s \u201ctravel ban\u201d executive order, which temporarily limits entry to the U.S. by nationals from six countries. The court will hear the appeal on the merits in October. On Tuesday it held unanimously that the executive order can be immediately enforced, with narrow exceptions, until they address the merits of these cases in the fall.The challenges to the order claimed it violated the First Amendment\u2019s protection of religious freedom and exceeded the president\u2019s authority under immigration law. Both the substance and tone of these decisions created an unmistakable impression that a portion of the judiciary has joined the anti-Trump \u201cresistance.\u201d Not only did the lower-court judges defy clear and binding Supreme Court precedent, they based much of their legal analysis, incredibly, on Candidate Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric.The high court didn\u2019t rule entirely in the administration\u2019s favor. By a 6-3 vote, with Justices Clarence Thomas,       Samuel Alito       and       Neil Gorsuch       dissenting, it held that the individuals who originally challenged the order could continue to do so, as could a carefully defined class of \u201csimilarly situated\u201d persons with \u201cclose familial\u201d relationships to individuals in the United States, along with institutions that can show a \u201cformal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course\u201d relationship to a U.S. entity.That, the court specifically cautioned, is not an invitation for evasion by immigration advocates: \u201cFor example, a nonprofit group devoted to immigration issues may not contact foreign nationals from the designated countries, add them to client lists, and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion.\u201dThat exception, Justice Thomas noted for the dissenters, was a \u201ccompromise\u201d\u2014most likely the product of Chief Justice       John Roberts\u2019s       effort to achieve a unanimous decision. Given the circumstances, this was a good outcome. It lends the imprimatur of the full court to the rebuke of the lower courts, and avoids the kind of partisan split that prevailed in both the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals. All nine justices are also now on record supporting the proposition that the vast majority of foreign nationals cannot claim a constitutional right to enter the United States.When the court reviews the merits of the case in the fall, however, such considerations will be out of place. While courts can adjudicate cases involving immigration and other foreign affairs issues, judicial engagement in this space is fundamentally different than in domestic affairs. In an area of decision-making that involves both institutional knowledge of international affairs and continuous access to classified information, great deference is in order from the courts. If the courts wade into this area, they would undermine both national security and respect for the judiciary. The perception that judging is swayed by political or ideological considerations would be particularly calamitous in this area. Better a 5-4 decision articulating this view clearly than a unanimous but equivocal one.The odds of a clear outcome are good. As Justice Thomas pointed out, his colleagues\u2019 \u201cimplicit conclusion\u201d is that the administration is likely to prevail on the merits. The high court\u2019s own precedent in this area is clear. Nonresident aliens have no constitutional right to enter the U.S. When denying entry, the president need only provide a \u201cfacially legitimate and bona fide\u201d justification. As the court held in Kleindienst v. Mandel (1972), once that justification is established, there is no further inquiry or balancing for the courts to make.Any other decision would be both inconsistent with the court\u2019s precedent and injurious to the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers. It would also compromise the president\u2019s ability to defend the nation at home and abroad and cause grave harm to the judicial branch in maintaining its own critical constitutional role.Messrs.

The fund is also significantly larger than the $18.4 billion flagship fund Apollo raised in 2013.Mr. Black said on a February earnings call that the Apollo flagship fund would be the biggest \u201csingle driver\u201d of assets under management at the firm. The company, which has $197 billion in assets under management, is also raising $3.5 billion for a distressed-debt fund.The fund adds to the mound of uninvested capital that private-equity firms are sitting on.Faced with increasing competition for assets from sovereign-wealth and pension funds, buyout houses have slowed the rate at which they have deployed capital. The value of deals struck by buyout firms fell 14% in 2016, while deal count dropped 18%, according to Bain & Co.\u2019s Global Private Equity Report 2017.This, coupled with a strong fundraising environment, resulted in firms accumulating a record $1.5 trillion of dry powder, according to the same report.The rate at which Apollo has been able to deploy the money it raises is likely to have played a role in encouraging investors to back the fund.Despite a wider slowdown, Apollo spent $9.6 billion on private-equity deals in 2016, a record for the firm. The flagship strategy can switch between buyout deals and distressed investments, boosting its capacity to spend.Adding to the dry powder, London-based CVC Capital Partners gathered \u20ac16 billion ($18.14 billion) earlier in June, the biggest fund ever raised by a European manager, while U.S. buyout giant             KKR                   & Co. closed record Asia and North American funds at $9 billion and $13.9 billion, respectively.Private-equity firms have generated consistently strong returns over the past decade, a performance that has fueled investor demand.Over the past five years buyout shops have delivered an average net internal rate of return of 15.84%, according to data provider Preqin Ltd. Buyout firms have failed to deliver double-digit returns in just two years since 2000, including 2008 and 2011.Hedge funds, which compete with buyout firms for money allocated to alternative assets, delivered net returns of 7.56% over the same period, according to Preqin.\u2014Dawn Lim  contributed to this article.Write to William Louch at william.louch@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Apollo Raises Record Total for Buyouts.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 18:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apollo-breaks-record-as-investors-flock-to-buyout-funds-1498588118", "news_title": "Apollo Breaks Record as Investors Flock to Buyout Funds ", "keywords": "apollo, apollo global management, blackstone capital, buyout fund, cvc capital, funds,kkr, leon black,pe fund news, private equity,Apollo Global Management,APO,Leon Black,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,leveraged buyouts,management buyouts,fund markets,commodity,financial market news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "American Airlines Group Inc.

Those capabilities, American and Analogic and said, could help airlines detect explosives or detonators hidden inside laptops and other small electronics.For three months the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has been considering whether to expand a ban on laptops and other devices in aircraft cabins, after intelligence suggested terrorists were working to smuggle explosives onto planes that way. The DHS banned devices on U.S.-bound flights from 10 airports in the Middle East and North Africa in March.Homeland Security Secretary       John Kelly       has suggested a broader ban that could cover all flights to the U.S. from Europe or all international flights in and out of the U.S. DHS has told European Union officials that airlines there may need to do additional security screening to avoid an electronics ban. Such steps could be implemented over time, a DHS spokesman said, and final plans haven\u2019t been set.American began testing one of the more powerful screening devices in Phoenix this month with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. Most U.S. airports and many overseas already use the technology to screen checked luggage. The technology, similar to a medical CT scan, is called \u201ccomputed tomography\u201d and hasn\u2019t been used for carry-on bags in the U.S.TSA intends to test a similar machine from another manufacturer at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport.Steve Karoly,        a TSA acting assistant administrator, said in a recent interview that the agency tested this technology with carry-on bags several years ago. But the scanners were large, costly and required a lot of power to operate. \u201cThe technology has just blossomed in the past year,\u201d Mr. Karoly said.It isn\u2019t clear how long TSA\u2019s review of the new machines could last.

SAFE -0.56%       that is expected to raise $250 million from an initial public offering and concurrent private placement.The shares started trading last Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.Pulling apart and structuring the components of the real estate asset, that is, the ground lease from the building itself, would be a more efficient use of capital, said Jay Sugarman, chairman and chief executive officer of iStar and the CEO of Safety.\u201cDifferent risk profiles should be owned by different investors,\u201d said Mr. Sugarman. He said a ground net lease is akin to a double-A bond and occupies \u201ca very safe place in the capital structure.\u201dThe REIT projects to pay an annualized dividend of 60 cents, which translates to a yield of 3% at the IPO price of $20, according to the prospectus.The REIT is the first publicly traded company tied directly to leases on the land underlying commercial real estate. In many commercial developments, ownership of the land is separate from ownership of the building on top, and landowners collect income from the owners of the brick-and-mortar buildings. Owners of hotels and office buildings, for example, often must pay ground leases.The leases generate steady income for landowners, potentially making them attractive to investors looking for safety at a time when real-estate and stock-market valuations are high and interest rates remain near historic lows.\u201cGround leases are real estate\u2019s analogy to buying Treasurys,\u201d said       Jim Sullivan,        president of Green Street\u2019s Advisory Group. \u201cWhen structured properly, they are perhaps the safest form of real estate that an investor can own.\u201dThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates in March and June as the economy continued to show signs of strength. Yet yields on 10-year Treasurys still hover around 2.2%. At the same time, an eight-year bull market for U.S. commercial property is fueling concerns that a correction is due.Ground net leases are typically \u201ctriple net leases,\u201d in which tenants are responsible for development costs, property-operating expenses, taxes and insurance. In the event of an economic downturn, the last thing tenants likely default on is the ground lease because it could result in the landowner taking back the land as well as the building on top of the land.\u201cThe upshot of this is that you\u2019re not buying the part of real estate that loses value, you\u2019re getting the good part,\u201d said       Michael Underhill,        chief investment officer at asset-management firm Capital Innovations LLC. \u201cWhile the building on your land might be obsolete in 20 years, the land itself shouldn\u2019t be.\u201dCapital Innovations isn\u2019t planning to invest in Safety because its business model doesn\u2019t meet the firm\u2019s corporate-governance standards, which include a dedicated management team, Mr. Underhill said.Safety has a portfolio of 12 ground leases that are signed by operators of hotels in Seattle, Salt Lake City and Dallas, as well as office buildings in Detroit, a medical office building in Cumming, Ga., a multifamily apartment building in Milwaukee and a self-storage facility in Bloomington, Minn.\u201cWe believe that rental income from ground net leases can provide us with a safe, secure and growing cash flow stream,\u201d said Safety\u2019s prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Two farmland REITs have similar models,             Gladstone Land Corp.       and             Farmland Partners,       which rent undeveloped land to farmers on a net-lease basis.

When the deal closes, SiriusXM will name three directors to Pandora\u2019s board, with one of the picks serving as chairman.Pandora also announced a deal to sell Ticketfly to Eventbrite Inc. for $200 million, down significantly from what Pandora originally paid in 2015.Pandora board member       Tim Leiweke       praised Mr. Westergren for stepping in \u201cat a critical time\u201d to \u201creset relations with the major labels, launch our on-demand service, reconstitute the management team and refortify our balance sheet by securing an investment from Sirius XM.\u201dShares of Pandora, down 35% so far this year, rose 0.4% to $8.49 in Tuesday trading.Pandora also on Tuesday said it named       Jason Hirschhorn,        founder and CEO of digital-content curation company ReDEF Group, to the company\u2019s board.

Mr. Hagan is a majority member of WealthColony.Filed Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., the lawsuit cites a number of \u201charassing\u201d text messages Mr. Hagan allegedly sent to the Soupman\u2019s chief executive asking for money.\u201cDon\u2019t forget me[.] I need love and so does soup,\u201d the lawsuit quotes Mr. Hagan saying in a message to Soupman Chief Executive Jamieson Karson, in one alleged attempt to receive cash from the company.A Soupman attorney said Tuesday that to the best of his knowledge Mr. Hagan was simply a shareholder, but his past with the company remains unclear.A lawyer for WealthColony\u2019s management team on Tuesday denied the allegations made in the lawsuit, saying it \u201cstrongly disagrees with its characterization of numerous facts.\u201dThe alleged extortion entreaties from Mr. Hagan began last summer, according to the lawsuit, well before federal prosecutors charged Soupman\u2019s former Chief Financial Officer Robert Bertrand with tax evasion. Mr. Bertrand has since pleaded not guilty.After Mr. Bertrand was indicted, Soupman\u2019s lawyers allege WealthColony\u2019s communication with the company \u201cturned from \u2018give me money\u2019 to \u2018give me the company.\u2019\u201dWealthColony used the indictment and Soupman\u2019s \u201cdire financial straits,\u201d as part of a smear campaign, the lawsuit claims.For its part, WealthColony says in court papers it has concerns regarding Soupman\u2019s management and \u201chas also been advised that other principals of the debtor are being investigated as well.\u201dJeremy Johnson, a lawyer for Soupman, denied Wealth Colony\u2019s allegations.\u201cTo our knowledge no one else is being investigated,\u201d Mr. Johnson said Tuesday.Soupman, which distributes its soups to about 6,500 grocery stores as well as New York City public schools, filed for chapter 11 protection two weeks ago and put its business on the auction block. The company licenses the recipes, likeness and name of       Al Yeganeh,        the man who inspired the \u201cSoup Nazi\u201d character in the television show.The lawsuit claims WealthColony is petitioning Soupman\u2019s shareholders to replace the company\u2019s board and management in a bid to derail the proposed restructuring.The company\u2019s stock, which had been traded over-the-counter, hasn\u2019t traded since June 14, and its price currently stands at less than a penny a share.Soupman is asking a bankruptcy judge to issue an injunction barring WealthColony\u2019s interference in the case.

Andrew Cuomo       on Tuesday called for an extraordinary legislative session Wednesday to extend mayoral control of New York City public schools for one year.His office said he had discussed the special session with legislative leaders but didn\u2019t detail any specific conditions attached to the extension.A spokeswoman for the Democratic-controlled Assembly said its members had been called back to Albany for a session at 1 p.m. and would review whatever proposal the governor sends.Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Republican-controlled Senate, said late Tuesday afternoon that negotiations were continuing. \u201cIs there a deal? No,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point there is no bill to consider.\u201dA spokesman for New York City Mayor       Bill de Blasio       said the special session was \u201ca big step in the right direction.\u201dLawmakers ended their legislative session officially last Wednesday with no agreement on renewing mayoral control of New York City schools, which expires Friday.If lawmakers don\u2019t renew it, the nation\u2019s largest school district would revert to a decentralized system. Many have called that system dysfunctional, but some critics of mayoral control say it gives Mr. de Blasio too much power, he hasn\u2019t done a good enough job fixing the schools and parents have too little say.Mr. de Blasio argues it is crucial for one person to be fully accountable for the district of 1.1 million children, and the authority allows for systemwide change, such as his expansion of free preschools.One of the main sticking points hinged on charter schools. A bill promoted by the Senate would lift the cap on the number of charter schools that could open in New York City, a condition the Assembly balked at.Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan, a Republican from Long Island, has no charters in his district but he has been backed by donors who see them as escapes from failing district schools. Charters aren\u2019t usually unionized and operate free from many constraints of district bureaucracy.Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat from the Bronx, has been backed by teachers unions, whose leaders charge that charters drain money from traditional public schools and don\u2019t take their fair share of hard-to-serve students.While the state cap on charters has been part of Albany horse-trading, there is still room for New York City\u2019s charter sector to grow under current limits. The New York City Charter School Center says there are 23 charters left to be issued in the city, and 124 elsewhere in the state.Charter advocates want the cap eliminated, saying tens of thousands of children are on waitlists for seats at the city\u2019s 216 operating charters. Some want a change in state statute so that contracts for charters that were closed or never opened wouldn\u2019t count against the cap.The charter sector scored a likely win last week when the SUNY Charter Schools Institute, which helps oversee many charters, proposed regulations that would let charters certify their own teachers. That change would help the city\u2019s largest charter network, Success Academy Charter Schools, and other schools grow and deal with teacher turnover.Susie Miller Carello, executive director of the institute, said currently most faculty at charters must be state certified. She said she expects the SUNY board of trustees\u2019 charter school committee to pass the proposal this fall after public comment. Supporters say charters need more flexibility and state certification doesn\u2019t reflect teaching talent, but opponents say the change would water down standards.Some observers have tied the proposal\u2019s appearance last Wednesday, during last-minute negotiations over mayoral control, to efforts to smooth the friction over charters. Ms. Carello said that her agency has been working on the changes since legislative language passed a year ago paved the way.The dragged-out negotiations over mayoral control have been an embarrassment to Mr. de Blasio. His predecessor,       Michael Bloomberg,        got a seven-year period of control in 2002 and then a six-year round.

It will give closer consideration to the case in October, when it will hear oral arguments.Joining Mr. Zarif in criticizing the decision,       Hossein Naghavi-Hosseini,        the spokesman for the Iranian parliament\u2019s national-security and foreign-policy commission, said Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cracist\u201d policies would backfire, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.Mr. Naghavi-Hosseini said the restrictions were a violation of the nuclear deal in 2015 between Iran and six world powers including the U.S., although he didn\u2019t specify how. Under that deal, Iran got relief from international sanctions in exchange for new curbs on its disputed nuclear program.\u201cHalting visa issuance is a type of human-rights violation that contradicts all the U.S. officials\u2019 claims and statements regarding respect for human rights,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t clear if Mr. Naghavi-Hosseini\u2019s views reflected those of the parliamentary body as a whole.Foreign Ministry spokesman       Bahram Ghasemi       said the decision to allow the partial ban was evidence of discrimination embedded in the U.S. system, IRNA reported.\u201cThe Islamic Republic closely examines the recent decision of the U.S. Supreme Court and will take proportional and reciprocal measures in this regard,\u201d he said, without specifying what those actions would be. Iran responded to previous versions of the ban by barring Americans from getting visas to visit the country.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah       Ali Khamenei       has been critical of the travel ban, saying in February that it exposed the \u201creal face\u201d of the U.S.Average Iranians also took to social media to criticize the ruling. Twitter user Ghazale Asgharin pointed out that few Iranians were allowed to travel to the U.S. even before the ban. \u201cTrump has ostensibly adjusted the visa issuance rules\u2014as if most Iranian honeymoon destinations had been the U.S.,\u201d she said.A spokesperson for the Libyan parliament based in the eastern port city of Tobruk said the House of Representatives condemned the decision. \u201cWe believe the ruling should be more specific to certain groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and individuals,\u201d said       Abdullah Blieheg.       \u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable to class all Libyans as a threat,\u201d he added.Other Middle Eastern ministers and heads of state have yet to react to the Supreme Court ruling, however, underlining a muted regional response to the latest development in the legal fight over the ban.The limited version of Mr. Trump\u2019s travel restrictions can take effect as soon as three days after the court\u2019s decision. The first version of the travel ban caused chaos as legal challenges mounted, families were divided and people from designated countries were left in limbo at airports.Under the Supreme Court ruling, travelers who have \u201ca bona fide relationship\u201d with people or organizations in the U.S., such as family, schools and employers, won\u2019t be impacted by the travel ban. The justices narrowed the ban on refugees in the same way.Muslim-majority countries that aren\u2019t affected by the ban haven\u2019t publicly opposed it. Many of them, including Saudi Arabia, the leading Sunni Muslim power in the Middle East, are staunch U.S. allies who have courted Mr. Trump in their battle against terrorism and the expansion of Iranian regional influence.\u2014       Hassan Morajea       in Tunis  contributed to this article.Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 17:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-foreign-minister-blasts-u-s-travel-ban-after-supreme-court-move-1498571613", "news_title": "Iran Foreign Minister Blasts U.S. Travel Ban After Supreme Court Move", "keywords": "extremism,muslim travel ban,terrorism,terrorists,travel ban court ruling,trump travel ban,political,general news,national,public security,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,government bodies,executive branch,judicial branch"}, {"content": "Nursing-home executives are intensifying their opposition to the Senate\u2019s health-care overhaul, concerned that the proposed multibillion-dollar cuts to Medicaid would gravely wound the industry.Before Senate Republicans postponed a vote on the legislation Tuesday, a conference call organized by the American Health Care Association drew nearly 800 participants. They were asked to contact their senators and representatives to discuss the bill\u2019s potential impact, and to involve employees and family members of residents in the lobbying effort.\u201cThis is the biggest threat that the sector has faced in at least 20 or 25 years,\u201d said       Mark Parkinson,        the trade group\u2019s president.The call\u2019s high turnout is a sign of the concern over how the reforms could hurt the industry. Medicaid covers expenses of more than 60% of the U.S.\u2019s roughly 1.4 million nursing-home residents, according to the nonprofit Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. At least 21% of Medicaid funding goes directly to pay for nursing homes and other long-term care providers.Nursing-home care typically costs $82,000 a year per resident, according to Kaiser estimates.LeadingAge, a national association of 5,600 nonprofit nursing homes and other providers of aging services, plans to alert members on Wednesday to use the July 4 recess to set up meetings with legislators in their district offices and to invite them to communities to speak with residents.\u201cFrom our perspective, the recess comes at a great time,\u201d said LeadingAge Chief Executive Katie Smith Sloan.Since January, LeadingAge members have sent more than 18,000 letters to Congress opposing the cuts. \u201cThis is heads and shoulders above anything we have generated on any other issue, probably by a factor of 10,\u201d said Ms. Sloan. \u201cThe level of intense concern is acute.\u201dThe Senate bill would reduce federal spending on Medicaid by $772 billion over the next decade, according to an analysis released by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office Monday.\u201cThose are pretty deep reductions,\u201d said       Barbara Lyons,        a senior vice president at Kaiser Foundation. \u201cAs states try to manage the deep reductions in federal Medicaid spending, it\u2019s hard to see how nursing-home facilities could escape.\u201dStates may respond by limiting eligibility for people who need long-term care, she said. They may also reduce payments, which could jeopardize efforts to improve nursing-home care.At Holly Heights Nursing Center in Denver, Medicaid covers at least part of the costs for more than 80% of the home\u2019s 130 long-term residents. Most of them are living on Social Security or exhaust their savings within a few months of arrival, said Janet Snipes, executive director of the privately owned home.Medicaid cutbacks would likely force her to cut workers and pull back on recent efforts to provide more personalized care.

A grand jury had voted on the three-count indictment Monday.\u201cThe indictment makes it clear that these defendants did more than merely obey an unofficial \u2018code of silence,\u2019 rather it alleges that they lied about what occurred to prevent independent criminal investigators from learning the truth,\u201d Ms. Holmes said.According to court documents, Detective March and Officers Walsh and Gaffney conspired to \u201cconceal the true facts of events surrounding the killing of Laquan McDonald\u2026to shield their fellow officer from criminal investigation and prosecution.\u201dThey \u201clied about what occurred and mischaracterized the video recordings\u201d of the shooting to keep the video from investigators and the public, the document added, and the officers created police forms \u201cthat contained important false information.\u201dOfficer Van Dyke, who is white, shot Mr. McDonald 16 times in October 2014 after officers responded to reports of a man breaking into vehicles. The officer has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges.A police dashboard camera video, was released more than a year later after a court order. It showed a dramatically different account of the shooting than was described by officers.A police report said Mr. McDonald had swung a knife at officers \u201cin an aggressive manner\u201d and that Officer Van Dyke continued firing because Mr. McDonald was attempting to get up and was still armed, according to court documents.The video, however, shows Mr. McDonald veering away from officers before he was shot, while holding a small knife at his side. When shot, Mr. McDonald immediately dropped to the ground.The indictment alleges the officers failed to locate, interview or identify witnesses whose information would contradict accounts of Chicago police.Lawyers for the three officers could not be immediately reached Tuesday. Only Officer Gaffney is still with the Chicago police, a department spokesman said, and he will be suspended per department policy.The officers could each be facing up to five years in prison and a $25,000 fine.The shooting and the alleged coverup, including the lengthy delay in releasing the video, led to widespread protests in Chicago and fallout within the police department. A new superintendent recommended that several officers be fired for allegedly lying over the incident.\u201cThe shooting of Laquan McDonald forever changed the Chicago Police Department and I am committed to implementing policies and training to prevent an incident like this from happening again,\u201d said Chicago Police Superintendent       Eddie Johnson.       \u201cThroughout this investigation, CPD has fully cooperated with prosecutors and will continue to do so.\u201dThe police department was also investigated by the Justice Department, which found a systemic practice of excessive force, particularly against minorities.Ms. Holmes, the special prosecutor, added that the grand jury investigation is continuing.

Brent gained 82 cents, or 1.8%, to $46.65 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Both made their largest daily gains in the past month.The market had already been getting a boost from bargain hunters and momentum from recent trading sessions. Prices are up for four straight sessions now, more than 4% since they hit their low point of the year on Wednesday. It is the longest winning streak in a month.Gains accelerated amid growing reports that computer systems at businesses, including shipping giant             A.P.

The market could be vulnerable to a snap back up because of how crowded the trade betting on lower prices had become.For several weeks, money managers have piled into bearish positions on U.S. oil, which reached their highest point in nearly 11 months a week ago, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Their bullish positions outnumber their bearish positions by the smallest amount since Aug. 9.When trades get that crowded, they can become prone to a reversal. Because so few traders may be left to take the opposite side of the trade, it can cause bids to rise quickly if something happens to trigger many sellers to stop\u2014or to close out bearish bets by buying back contracts they had sold\u2014at once.And traders will find reports of cyberattacks \u201cunsettling,\u201d said Ric Navy, senior vice president for energy futures at brokerage R.J.

Other unknown factors, or even forecast declines in both stocks and supply in the official U.S. data due Wednesday, could have been the spark for a reversal. A tropical system in the Gulf of Mexico forced some oil rigs and platforms to shut down temporarily last week, and some traders may also be opting to stop selling or close out bearish bets ahead of a government report Wednesday on U.S. stockpiles.\u201cSeasonally you expect a draw, and I guess there\u2019s been so much focus on supply, and now you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s seasonally normal\u2026I guess that\u2019s supportive,\u201d said Michael Hiley, a trader at LPS Futures LLC. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of position management.\u201dThe American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said late Tuesday that its own data for the week showed an 800,000-barrel increase in crude supplies, a 1.4M-barrel rise in gasoline stocks and a 700,000-barrel increase in distillate inventories, according to a market participant.Gasoline futures gained 2.11 cents, or 1.5%, to $1.4598 a gallon.

N.V.      \u2019s nuclear construction business.Westinghouse, the nuclear construction arm of Japan\u2019s             Toshiba Corp.      , is operating under chapter 11 protection due to the cost overruns and delays in the business. It had been counting on getting a favorable ruling in a fight over the purchase price. Tuesday\u2019s decision restricts Westinghouse\u2019s ability to raise the bulk of its challenges to Chicago Bridge\u2019s calculations when an independent auditor is called upon to set a price on the deal.The dispute concerns how to calculate the purchase price for Chicago Bridge\u2019s nuclear unit, CB&I Stone & Webster. Originally hired in 2008 to build nuclear power plants in South Carolina and Georgia, Stone & Webster was sold to Westinghouse to resolve disagreements over how the construction was going.Tuesday\u2019s ruling leaves to an independent auditor the question of how the final purchase price will be calculated. Westinghouse says Chicago Bridge owes it $2 billion. Much of the Westinghouse calculation, however, is based on the challenges that the Delaware Supreme Court barred it from raising before the auditor. Chicago Bridge, meanwhile, contends Westinghouse owes it more than $400 million.Delaware\u2019s top court said the governing sale documents prevent Westinghouse from raising claims with the auditor that Chicago Bridge financial statements didn\u2019t comply with generally accepted accounting principles. The prohibition is in line with protections Chicago Bridge bargained for in the deal, which shielded it from accusations that it breached the terms of the purchase agreement, the ruling said.\u201cCB&I looks forward to quickly resolving any remaining disputes between the parties, which we believe should be immaterial in light of the court\u2019s ruling,\u201d said CB&I Chief Executive       Philip K. Asherman.A Westinghouse spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately return a message seeking comment on the ruling.The decision reverses a Delaware trial court that ruled against Chicago Bridge in December.The litigation was initially halted when Westinghouse filed for chapter 11 but the companies later agreed the dispute would continue moving during the bankruptcy.\u2014Peg Brickley contributed to this article.Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 16:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/delaware-supreme-court-rules-against-westinghouse-in-chicago-bridge-fight-1498596905", "news_title": "Delaware Supreme Court Rules Against Westinghouse in Chicago Bridge Fight ", "keywords": " bankruptcy, bankruptcynews,chapter 11, chicago bridge, chicago bridge & iron, court, lawsuit, nuclear,nuclear construction, toshiba,westinghouse,Chicago Bridge & Iron,CBI,Westinghouse Electric,Stone & Webster,Toshiba,6502.TO,corporate crime,legal action,bankruptcy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,government bodies,judicial branch,energy,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,nuclear power generation,computers,consumer electronics,personal electronics,heavy construction,power station construction,technical services,business,consumer services,construction,real estate,electric utilities,technology,utilities"}, {"content": "The Golden State Warriors\u2019 Andre Iguodala, a savvy startup investor and former NBA Finals MVP, is making a late-night TV show.Fresh off winning a championship, Mr. Iguodala is teaming up with Cheddar, the startup founded by former BuzzFeed       executive Jon Steinberg,        to create a late-night-style variety show called \u201cEvenings with Andre.\u201d It will feature interviews with guests from business, technology, sports and entertainment.The two hope to sell the show to a premium TV network or streaming service like             Netflix                   or Amazon, and split the proceeds.

He also plans to have a cooking segment on the show. \u201cI\u2019m a foodie,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you look at a lot of the diseases the body goes through and the reasons, the majority of it has to do with our diet. I\u2019m still doing more and more research.\u201dIn Cheddar\u2019s predominantly under-30 audience, Mr. Iguodala says there are \u201ca lot of people who are trying to find their way and this show will give them inspiration that anything can be done.\u201dAthletes have been making their stamp in media in a bigger way, using direct platforms to communicate with fans and tell their stories outside of traditional media. Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James owns a media startup called Uninterrupted, which offers documentaries, web series and a podcast network. Mr. James also struck a production partnership in 2015 with Warner Bros. spanning movies, television and digital content.Mr. Iguodala\u2019s show will be shot during the off-season. Mr. Steinberg believes the show will be produced at a budget of between $50,000 and $200,000 per episode, running to the more expensive end if a partner wants higher production values.The partnership marks the first foray by Cheddar into creating original TV network-style shows that could be sold to other outlets. A big sale could help pad Cheddar\u2019s financials as it seeks to become profitable.Mr. Steinberg said the company will eke out a small profit in June but is pretty much operating at break-even, generating $1 million a month in revenue that\u2019s offset by about $1 million in costs.

Meanwhile, utility stocks, often a refuge for nervous investors, have rallied this year, with another move up Monday helping to lift the broader market.Other signs of anxiety abound: A measure that shows investors expect big swings in the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, rose to an all-time high this month. The VIX, known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, has been stuck near an all-time low. The cost of insuring against a drop in the S&P 500 has climbed steadily since the beginning of the year. And currencies typically considered havens, such as the Swiss franc, have appreciated against the dollar since last month.So far this month, investors have pulled $235 million from the two largest exchange-traded funds that profit from declining volatility, on track to be the biggest monthly outflow since November, according to FactSet.The moves illustrate a bind ensnaring many investors. Stocks have soared to records this year, even as anxiety mounts over a cluster of issues that could derail the rally. Those include fears that a mistimed interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve could dent economic growth, an accelerating drop in oil prices could hurt wagers on emerging markets, or China\u2019s economy could slow, with consequences beyond its borders.Although money managers are loath to sit out a market rally, many have opted to increase their allocations to investments that would take the edge off a sharp decline in markets.Erik Knutzen,        chief \u200einvestment officer for multiasset-class portfolios at Neuberger Berman, has recently trimmed his exposure to assets that have soared in price, such as U.S. large-capitalization stocks, concerned that lofty valuations could take a hit if there\u2019s a threat to global growth. Mr. Knutzen has also been selling put options on stocks, a strategy that enables his funds to make extra income but one that could also require a pay out on the options in a market downturn.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety about where to put money to work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the VIX won\u2019t stay low forever.\u201dSome investors worry the Fed\u2019s pace of interest-rate increases will further slow a U.S. recovery that appears to have shifted into low gear. While the Fed\u2019s decision earlier this month to raise rates was widely expected, many investors were surprised that Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen gave little weight to a series of weak inflation readings and indicated the central bank remains on track to tighten monetary policy for a third time this year.Stocks fell an average of 7.4% in the six months after the Fed raised rates during a quarter in which GDP growth was 1.2% or below, according to data from UBS Group AG that analyzes three decades of Fed policy.Some wariness is already apparent in the bond market, several analysts said. The yield premium investors demand to hold the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note relative to the two-year note shrank this month to the smallest since September, approaching a 2007 low. A falling premium is known as a flattening yield curve and typically happens when worries rise that economic momentum is slowing.\u201cThe bond market is already pricing in a Fed policy mistake,\u201d said David Woo, head of global interest rates and foreign exchange at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.While riskier assets such as emerging markets are rising on hopes that a global recovery is sparking long absent inflation, \u201cthe bond market believes that rates will go up and inflation...will get crushed,\u201d Mr. Woo said.He is also worried that a recent drop in oil prices will rout investors from emerging-market trades that have delivered big gains this year. The Russian ruble, which tends to move with oil prices, is down about 3.7% this month. Mr. Woo is advising his clients to buy the Japanese yen, a popular haven for investors during turbulent times. The yen has strengthened around 2% from its May lows against the dollar.Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy EMEA at             State Street Global Markets,       which manages $2.56 trillion, is using an options strategy that would benefit if a bout of uncertainty caused sharp declines in comparatively volatile major currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars.A Chinese economic slowdown is clients\u2019 top concern, according to a poll his firm recently conducted. Moody\u2019s Investors Service cut China\u2019s sovereign credit rating for the first time in nearly three decades last month, even as Beijing has intensified a campaign to rein in risky investment and financing practices that pose a threat to the world\u2019s second-largest economy.Even though risky assets have lately performed well, \u201cthere is a desire to hedge,\u201d Mr. Graf said. \u201cInvestors are trying to guess where the next crisis will come from.\u201d\u2014Gunjan Banerji and Asjylyn Loder contributed to this article.Write to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   A Neuberger Berman money manager has been selling put options on stocks, a strategy that enables his funds to make extra income but one that could also require a pay out on the options in a market downturn.

So far, it looks like the struggles will continue.Sprint        S -0.47%       is in talks with             Comcast        CMCSA 0.41%       and             Charter Communications        CHTR 0.57%       on a deal that could lead the cable companies to invest in the wireless company\u2019s network for the right to use its network at a reduced rate and might even result in the total purchase of Sprint, The Wall Street Journal reported. The talks come after a May 8 announcement by Comcast and Charter of the formation of a yearlong partnership during which the two cable companies will coordinate their wireless strategies.Either way, Sprint needs a deal. With a market value roughly equal to its $33 billion in net debt, a tie up may be the only way for Sprint to get the resources to invest enough in its network to remain competitive. A deal with cable would be bad for Sprint\u2019s wireless competitors because it would reduce the likelihood of industry consolidation through the hoped-for merger of Sprint and             T-Mobile.       It also would lower the cost of offering wireless service for the two cable companies, further exacerbating wireless competition. The optimistic view is that Sprint is talking to the cable guys to get T-Mobile and its majority owner             Deutsche Telekom                   to agree to a deal on more favorable terms.Shares of T-Mobile fell 3% Tuesday while shares of             Verizon                   and             AT&T                   declined 2% and 1%, respectively.Comcast and Charter, both of which have a deal with Verizon to use its network for their wireless services, would get another national network to use at terms that could be significantly more favorable. By using their existing infrastructure, the cable companies could cut the amount that Sprint needs to invest. That would account for the bulk of the $35 billion to $40 billion in savings that would come from a deal, according to New Street Research. A deal between Sprint and T-Mobile could save around $44 billion, New Street says.T-Mobile may still be Sprint\u2019s first choice for a partner, but even under a Republican administration, a merger with a close rival would come with significant regulatory risk. Sprint abandoned its earlier pursuit of T-Mobile in 2014 when regulators signaled they would block a deal. T-Mobile may be pushing for a high breakup fee, in addition to greater control over the combined company. By talking with cable, Sprint is showing T-Mobile it too has leverage.Investors need to watch for signs that the cable talks are merely a distraction from a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile.

The report, produced by former U.S. federal prosecutor Michael J. Garcia, also provided a number of previously undisclosed examples showing rampant favor-mongering among members of FIFA\u2019s ruling executive committee and the culture of entitlement that led to the demise of the body\u2019s top officials.Garcia described a \u201cculture of expectation and entitlement\u201d on the committee, adding that \u201ca number of Executive Committee members displayed a disregard for ethical guidelines and an attitude that the rules do not apply to them.\u201dFIFA made the sudden decision to publish the report on its website despite its years under wraps after a German newspaper said on Monday that it had obtained a copy. In a statement, the organization said the newly appointed leaders of its Ethics Committee had planned to discuss publishing the report at meeting next week, a move their predecessors had opposed.The Garcia report, when it was first delivered in the late summer of 2014, in many respects marked the beginning of FIFA\u2019s modern turmoil. That December, Garcia resigned in protest from his role as FIFA\u2019s independent investigator, claiming FIFA\u2019s leaders had made \u201cnumerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of facts and conclusions\u201d in their summary of his report. The following May, Swiss police descended on FIFA\u2019s favorite hotel in Zurich to arrest several FIFA executive committee members as part of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation.More than half of the 22 sitting executive committee members at the time of the Russia and Qatar awards have since been dismissed amid allegations of ethical wrongdoing. Many of the individuals in the report have also left FIFA or been disciplined by the organization since Garcia delivered it in the late summer of 2014.Former president Sepp Blatter, meanwhile, was not accused of any ethical wrongdoing by Garcia. The report predates the allegations of financial impropriety made by Swiss authorities in 2015, which would ultimately result in him being banned from FIFA and removed from the presidency after 18 years as the most powerful man in world soccer. But the report saddles Blatter, who has denied wrongdoing, with at least some blame for FIFA\u2019s ills.The report alleges that Blatter maintained his lock on power by essentially buying the loyalty of the organization\u2019s all-powerful executive committee. In the fall of 2010, as the vote neared as the scandals surrounding the upcoming vote on the World Cup bids, Blatter proposed giving a bonus of $200,000 for each member of the executive committee, including Amos Adamu of Nigeria and Reynald Temarii of Tahiti, who at the time were provisionally suspended for seeking bribes in exchange for their votes. Just weeks before, Blatter had called the two men \u201cdevils\u201d of the sport.The report is filled with sordid details of other alleged pay-for-play schemes among the sport\u2019s top officials, bid leaders, consultants and hangers on.There are extensive email exchanges in which Harold Mayne-Nicholls, former chairman of the Bid Evaluation Group for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups and former Chilean Football Association President, sought training for his sons and a coaching job for his brother-in-law at the Aspire Sports Academy in Qatar while he is evaluating the Qatar bid.Michel D\u2019Hooghe, an executive committee member from Belgium, allowed a family friend to use his name while he sought a business relationship with Qatar during the campaign, then claimed to have known nothing about it. Garcia concluded that was nearly impossible.Temarii, the executive committee member from Tahiti, opted to appeal his banishment from FIFA just days before the vote. That prevented that vote from going to another member who likely would have chosen Australia. Weeks later, Mohamed Bin Hammam, an executive committee member from Qatar, paid Temarii \u20ac300,000.The FIFA committee members have previously denied wrongdoing.The most astounding revelation in the report has little to do with payoffs or favors. According to the report, the executive committee never discussed the overwhelming heat in Qatar in June, where temperatures regularly reach 120 degrees. That later forced the organization to shift the 2022 tournament to December, costing FIFA hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. media rights fees.Write to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com and Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'FIFA Releases Secret Report.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 16:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fifa-releases-secret-report-on-internal-corruption-1498585347", "news_title": "FIFA Releases Secret Report on Internal Corruption ", "keywords": "political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,financial crime,soccer,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing how to alleviate the harshest side effects of a European Union law that could have U.S. repercussions for banks trying to comply with it.The EU law, which goes into effect in January, will require investors to pay directly for investment research provided by banks\u2019 brokerage arms. The EU measure aims to make research costs more transparent for end investors by breaking them out separately from the trading commissions that investment firms pay.Yet U.S. law discourages paying for research directly by imposing stricter legal obligations on brokers that accept separate payment for research. U.S. rules have for many years accommodated the current arrangement, which dates to an era when commissions were fixed by exchange rules and brokers competed by offering extra services such as research reports. The extra responsibilities would entail higher legal costs and complicate brokers\u2019 roles as sellers of stocks and bonds, according to industry officials.Wall Street wants to avoid that outcome, and two Republican lawmakers took up their cause on Tuesday at a Senate budget hearing by urging SEC Chairman       Jay Clayton       to find a solution.Sens. Jerry Moran (R., Kan.) and John Boozman (R., Ark.) both asked Mr. Clayton to help U.S. firms avert the worst outcome\u2014brokers withholding their research from European clients to avoid the repercussions of the European regime, known as Mifid II, for Markets in Financial Instruments Directive.\u201cI am not certain that the power we have will be able to facilitate all relief that people might want, but this is something that the staff is very much looking to do,\u201d Mr. Clayton said, adding that the SEC needs the cooperation of European regulators to fully ease the impact on U.S. firms.\u201cWe are looking to ensure the fear that people have\u2014that research becomes restricted\u2014does not occur,\u201d said Mr. Clayton, who didn\u2019t give details on how the SEC might provide the relief.The rules targeting how research is financed are one of the most controversial aspects of Mifid II. Industry officials say it is especially murky how Mifid II\u2019s rules would apply to global asset managers that have significant operations in Europe but also invest in the U.S. and Asia.One likely outcome of the proposed rules will be a significant scaling down of banks\u2019 investment-research divisions as they struggle to find customers willing to pay for research directly. Some banks and brokers already are taking a hard look at their less used analyst and research teams, according to industry officials.The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the biggest trade group of U.S. broker-dealers, wants the SEC to clarify that complying with the European rules won\u2019t trigger stricter obligations in the U.S., such as restricting their ability to trade with customers who buy their research.The SEC could temporarily exempt brokers from the fallout while U.S. and European regulators hash out how their rule sets can coexist without disrupting the business model of U.S. firms. In the longer term, the agency also could issue legal guidance that grants more certainty to Wall Street that they can charge European clients separately for research without having to comply with stricter U.S. requirements.\u201cIt\u2019s a European rule that is in direct conflict with U.S. law\u2026and could have some very negative consequences domestically and globally,\u201d said       Kenneth Bentsen,        Sifma\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe are glad to see the Senate raise the issue and we are glad to hear Chairman Clayton is focused on it because the clock is ticking to January.\u201dWrite to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Wall Street Presses SEC Over EU Law.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 16:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-faces-cross-border-conflict-on-analyst-research-1498595227", "news_title": "Wall Street Faces Cross-Border Conflict on Analyst Research", "keywords": "analyst,asset manager,brokerage,eu,investment research,investors,markets in financial instruments directive,midfid,sec,European Union,Jay Clayton,Jerry Moran,John Boozman,analysts' comments,recommendations,corporate,industrial news"}, {"content": "About two-thirds of the contractors who are struggling with the labor shortages gripping the construction industry say it has become a challenge to finish jobs on time, according to a new survey.More than one-third of contractors said they are being forced to turn work down and 58% said they are putting in higher bids, said the survey sponsored by             USG Corp.

It was designed to gauge such trends as backlogs, revenue projections, access to financing and labor issues.Two-thirds of the contractors surveyed predicted there would be more workers in the next six months.

The analysis also showed the bill would lower the federal deficit by $321 billion over 10 years.A similar CBO estimate for the increase in uninsured under the House bill weighed heavily on members of that chamber and played a large part in its failure there. The House eventually passed a revised bill\u2014before a CBO score was released.       Susan Collins       of Maine, a moderate Republican, voiced her opposition to the Senate bill after the CBO score came out Monday.Less than 24 hours after the CBO report was released, Mr. McConnell delayed a vote on health care until after Congress\u2019s July 4 recess. GOP leaders had wanted to hold a vote this week but struggled to placate party\u2019s different wingsQ: Which GOP Senators are not ready to vote yes?To get a bill passed, Mr. McConnell can only afford to lose two votes from his slim 52-48 majority. With no Democrats expected to vote for the measure, losing two Republican votes would lead to a 50-50 tie, with Vice President       Mike Pence       standing by to break a tie. As of now, at least nine Republicans said they are opposed to the Senate bill:Sen.       Rand Paul,        KentuckySen. Ted Cruz, TexasSen. Mike Lee, UtahSen. Ron Johnson, WisconsinSen. Susan Collins, MaineSen. Dean Heller, NevadaSen.       Shelley Moore Capito,        West VirginiaSen. Rob Portman, OhioSen. Jerry Moran, KansasThe conservatives say the Senate GOP plan doesn\u2019t go far enough to lower health-care costs for consumers, and that the Republicans should offer a more robust Obamacare repeal bill.Some of the centrists in opposition say the bill doesn\u2019t do enough to protect the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, while others are concerned about restrictions on funding for women\u2019s health organization Planned Parenthood, among other reasons.Q: So is the bill dead?No. Some of the more conservative members\u2014Messrs. Johnson, Lee and Cruz\u2014are seen as more likely than the centrist members are to come around with some negotiation with the White House and GOP leadership. Those members and Mr. Paul say they are willing to negotiate. If these three members came to support the bill and no other GOP senators came out against the measure, Mr. McConnell would need the support of just one more current holdout, as long as he loses no one else.The task is somewhat daunting at this point, but not impossible. President       Donald Trump       himself said the Republicans face a \u201cnarrow path\u201d to passage in the Senate. Mr. Paul may withhold support for anything less than an outright repeal of Obamacare, and the Senate isn\u2019t keen to go that far\u2014the GOP plan does keep some aspects of the 2010 law. Mr. Heller may face a tough re-election challenge in 2018, and Mr. McConnell is known to work to shield those in his caucus from politically tough votes when possible.That may lead to some serious negotiating with Ms. Collins to get her to a \u201cyes,\u201d but she has shown a willingness to stand against her party before. She was one of two GOP Senators to vote against the confirmation of       Betsy DeVos       as Education Secretary, forcing Mr. Pence to cast the first-ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a cabinet member.If Ms. Collins\u2014as well as Messrs. Johnson, Lee and Cruz\u2014is persuaded to vote for the Senate health bill, that would stand to put the tally in the Senate at 50-50, leading to Mr. Pence\u2019s tie-breaker.Q: What is the schedule?Mr. McConnell was expected to push for a vote on Thursday but the party ran into a procedural hurdle, as it appeared Mr. McConnell lacked the Republican votes to proceed to debate the bill. Mr. McConnell delayed plans for a vote after Ms. Collins and others had signaled they would vote no on a \u201cmotion to proceed\u201d if the bill hit the Senate floor in its current form.Mr. McConnell had really wanted to wrap up this process before the July 4 break, but the real deadline seems to be before the August recess. Congress goes to recess for the month of August and during that time many Republicans may face tough town halls with constituents in their districts. The Republican effort to roll back Obamacare comes as the law, passed by Democrats in 2010, is seeing some of its best approval ratings from the public. GOP leaders fear political pressure over the recess\u2014as well as the fact that Republicans leaders will want to move on to other business such as a tax overhaul -- could doom the bill.Write to Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 16:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-republican-health-bill-whats-next-in-the-process-1498583867", "news_title": "Senate Republican Health Bill: What\u2019s Next After Delay?", "keywords": "affordable care act,cbo analysis,gop health bill,health bill dead,health care bill,obamacare,repeal,repeal and replace,republican health bill,senate health bill,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "President       Donald Trump\u2019s       administration is moving ahead with plans to dismantle another piece of the Obama administration\u2019s environmental legacy, the rule that sought to protect clean drinking water by expanding Washington\u2019s power to regulate major rivers and lakes as well as smaller streams and wetlands.The Environmental Protection Agency, Department of the Army and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are proposing a new rule that would rescind the Obama administration\u2019s Waters of the United States, or WOTUS, rule and \u201crecodify the regulatory text\u201d that existed before its adoption in 2015, according to a press release obtained by The Wall Street Journal that will be sent out\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0afternoon.That action, the agencies contend, \u201cwould provide certainty in the interim\u201d while a new rule-making process is undertaken.Coming almost a month after Mr. Trump announced plans to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord,\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0move is another sign the new administration and the EPA under administrator       Scott Pruitt       intend to prioritize the economic concerns of industry and agricultural interests over environmental concerns and, more broadly, to erase significant pieces of former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       legacy.\u201cWe are taking significant action to return power to the states and provide regulatory certainty to our nation\u2019s farmers and businesses,\u201d\u00a0Mr. Pruitt said in a statement.Aimed at clearing up decades of jurisdictional and legal uncertainty and protecting more American\u2019s drinking water from contamination, the rule, which was tied to a provision of the Clean Water Act of 1972, greatly expanded the federal government\u2019s authority to limit pollution in major bodies of water like Chesapeake Bay and the Mississippi River, as well as in small streams and wetlands.It was immediately met with legal challenges, which has delayed its implementation, and has been a source of consternation to many in farm country who complained about another layer of onerous Washington regulations.\u201cIn Iowa, 97% of the land is subject to extensive overregulation by the EPA and unnecessarily hamstrings our farmers, businesses and manufacturers,\u201d said Sen. Joni Ernst (R., Iowa), who called the EPA\u2019s announcement that it will eliminate an \u201coverreaching\u201d rule \u201cgood news\u201d for her state.For the last two years, property developers, chemical manufacturers and oil-and -gas producers also have voiced opposition to the rule, which they argued is an intrusion on property owners\u2019 rights and an impediment to economic growth.Mr. Trump, who agreed with that view, signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0in late February directing the EPA to review WOTUS and to do so based on a much narrower interpretation of \u201cnavigable waters\u201d as outlined in a 2006 Supreme Court opinion by Justice       Antonin Scalia.In that case, which stemmed from a suit filed by a Michigan developer who challenged federal authority over patches of wetlands on his property, the court reached an impasse as three other conservative justices joined Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion while four more liberal justices concluded that the EPA should be able to regulate anywhere that water flowed at some point throughout the year.The ninth justice,       Anthony Kennedy,        attempted to split the difference by calling for the rules to cover any wetlands with a \u201csignificant nexus\u201d to navigable waters, wording that the Obama administration seized on in 2015 as it wrote a 400-page document laying out all the ways in which various water features affect larger rivers.Environmental groups uniformly blasted the EPA\u2019s announcement on Tuesday, promising to challenge the agency\u2019s move in the courts.\u201cRolling back clean water safeguards and weakening protections for the drinking water of more than one-third of all Americans is alarming,\u201d said Rosemary Enobakhare, a former deputy associate administrator at the EPA. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s intentional disregard for the public support around the 2015 clean water rule is disheartening.\u201dBut the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Farm Bureau and a number of GOP lawmakers from states reliant on agriculture all cheered the announcement.The chamber, which is among the dozens of business associations that filed lawsuits over the WOTUS rule, issued a statement praising the EPA for taking an \u201canalytical\u201d approach to fixing a \u201cmisguided\u201d rule.\u201cNow, all stakeholders will have an opportunity to provide public comment, and the agency will have the proper time to analyze the input and unwind a confusing rule that impacted America\u2019s businesses, farmers, and land owners,\u201d said Bill Kovacs, U.S. Chamber of Commerce senior vice president for environment, technology, and regulatory affairs.The American Farm Bureau Federation also applauded the announcement.\u201cWe know the importance of clean water, and farmers and ranchers work hard to protect our natural resources every day,\u201d said Zippy Duvall, the bureau\u2019s president. \u201cBut this rule was never really about clean water.

That tax extender went unapproved when lawmakers linked it to deadlocked legislation extending mayoral control of New York City schools.The legislature also failed to pass measures affecting tax revenues in 53 counties and three other cities outside New York City.New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       has summoned Albany lawmakers back to session to reach a deal on mayoral control. The ratings firms said they expected the tax extenders would eventually be approved before they were allowed to sunset in November and December. But they said any lapse of the extenders could have a severe impact on local governments.If the measure allowing New York City to levy personal income tax isn\u2019t approved by\u00a0Dec. 31, when it expires, the city could lose $2.9 billion in personal income tax revenue, Fitch said, leading to an immediate budget gap. Moody\u2019s said\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0the city\u2019s personal income tax revenue would decline by more than 60%.Fitch said a lapse could also ultimately affect credit ratings for New York City municipal bonds, and those of several other cities across the state secured by personal income taxes.\u201cFitch expects the extensions to ultimately be extended before they expire, but Fitch will take any rating actions it deems appropriate if this expectation is not met,\u201d the ratings firm said June 23.On Tuesday, S&P said it estimated revenues for the Transitional Finance Authority, which funds the city\u2019s capital projects, could decrease by 15% in fiscal year 2018 if the tax extender is allowed to lapse.

The yield on the 10-year German bund, the benchmark for the eurozone\u2019s debt markets, posted the biggest one-day rise since Dec 2015, according to Tradeweb. Yields rise as bond prices fall.The selling pressure spread to government bonds in Denmark, Sweden, the U.K. and the U.S., pushing up the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note from its 2017 low set Monday. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.198%, up from 2.135% on Monday.Mr. Draghi hinted Tuesday that the ECB might start winding down its large monetary stimulus as the eurozone economy picks up speed, even as he warned against an abrupt end to years of easy money.The comment surprised many investors because Mr. Draghi appeared to be more hawkish compared with his comment earlier this month, fueling anxiety that the value of government bonds would fall when the central bank starts reducing its monthly large bond purchases.\u201cIt is the risk that policy accommodation may be removed sooner than previously thought, spelling trouble for investors,\u201d said Christopher Sullivan, chief investment officer at the United Nations Federal Credit Union.The yield on the 10-year German bund rose to 0.37%, the highest close since May 24, compared with 0.249% Monday, according to Tradeweb.Italy\u2019s bond market was the hardest hit with the 10-year bond yield soaring to 2.052% from 1.893% Monday, according to Tradeweb.The ECB\u2019s large bond buying program, along with that from the Bank of Japan, has been a big factor pushing down global government bond yields to their historically low levels over the past few years. The buying has helped keep a lid on the U.S. Treasury bond yields even as the U.S. labor market is approaching full employment and the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times since Dec. 2015.Tuesday\u2019s selling reminds bond investors the broad ripples from central bank policies as these banks are becoming a large presence in the world\u2019s major government debt market. As the world\u2019s financial markets are increasingly correlated and with trading increasingly automated, a selloff or rally in one market easily transmits into other peers.Investors remember the 2013 taper tantrum in the Treasury market. The 10-year Treasury yield soared after bond investors were spooked by then Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke\u2019s comments that the central bank may start reducing bond buying soon. The selloff rippled to other bond markets, pushing up long-term borrowing costs for consumers and businesses and undercut the growth momentum.The German government bond market led a broad selloff in 2015 when concerns grew over the ECB\u2019s bond buying program, showing how vulnerable these haven bond markets\u2014among the world\u2019s most liquid assets\u2014have become due to unconventional monetary policy. Critics have said that the bond buying program has distorted bond market signals, and investors are finding it hard to put a price tag on bonds\u2019 valuation.Brian Brennan, portfolio manager at             T. Rowe Price,       said the risk of a tantrum type of selloff is low at the moment. Still, Mr. Brennan said government bonds are rich in valuation and investors tend to \u201cfrontrun\u201d central bank policies, which leaves bondholders vulnerable when sentiment sours.Central bankers have been careful in managing market expectations to avoid another bond market rout that would hurt the broader economy. Fed Chair       Janet Yellen       said Tuesday that the central bank intends to \u201cvery gradually and predictably\u201d shrink its balance sheet, another step in its plan to normalize interest rate policy.Officials from the ECB and BOJ have been cautious too. So far, top ECB officials have avoided discussing the future of their bond purchases after December, when the program is currently set to end.Mr. Draghi said Tuesday that the ECB\u2019s stimulus policies are working and will be slowly withdrawn as the economy accelerates. However, he warned that \u201cany adjustments to our stance have to be made gradually, and only when the improving dynamics that justify them appear sufficiently secure.\u201dWrite to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 15:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/draghi-sparks-selloff-in-global-bonds-1498576194", "news_title": "Draghi Sparks Selloff in Global Bonds", "keywords": "bonds,ecb,european central bank,government bonds,mario draghi,treasurys,treasury yields,Mario Draghi,Brian Brennan,Christopher Sullivan,monetary policy,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014The European Union\u2019s antitrust regulator on Tuesday fined             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s        GOOGL 0.59%       Google a record \u20ac2.42 billion ($2.71 billion), saying its search engine stacks the deck in favor of its own comparison-shopping service.The move, which follows more than seven years of investigations, threatens far-reaching ramifications not just for Google, but for the design of products and services from other increasingly dominant tech giants.If the ruling sets a precedent that sticks, Google and other large tech firms may be forced to rethink how they plan to profit from some of their most popular offerings.Antitrust experts and tech executives say that question arises in areas where tech giants have introduced major innovations\u2014like Google\u2019s search engine\u2014that become gateways to the internet. EU regulators worry that tech firms, by inserting themselves into such a key role of funneling and directing consumer traffic, could take unfair advantage.In her announcement of the Google decision, EU antitrust chief       Margrethe Vestager       stressed that dominant companies have special \u201cresponsibilities\u201d not to hinder competition. \u201cThey are not allowed to abuse their power in one market to give themselves an advantage in another,\u201d she said.Google General Counsel       Kent Walker       said \u201cwe respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today.\u201d The company said it will review the decision and consider an appeal.How Google ends up changing its business model to comply with the EU ruling \u201ccould eventually apply to any way that Amazon,             Facebook                   or anyone else offers to search for products or services\u201d depending on \u201cwhat sort of bottleneck they impose on the process,\u201d said Michael A. Carrier, a law professor at Rutgers University.Tuesday\u2019s fine is the latest broadside by European authorities against Silicon Valley, at a time when tech firms face few regulatory challenges in the U.S. or elsewhere. The EU has already indicated it is looking at the same potential issue in relation to some of the newest innovations Silicon Valley is pushing, including voice-activated digital assistants, which often provide a sole answer in response to a query.At the heart of the EU\u2019s case is what regulators believe is Google\u2019s outsized control over internet traffic. Google handles about 92% of global internet searches, according to research firm StatCounter. For product-related searches, such as \u201cgas grill\u201d or \u201csmartphones,\u201d Google often returns a series of ads atop its search results that link to retailers\u2019 sites. Merchants pay Google each time a user clicks on their respective ad.Comparison-shopping sites operate similarly, charging merchants for clicks, but they say their traffic has plummeted in recent years as Google expanded its own shopping service. Links to those shopping sites typically appear much lower in Google search results, which the EU says gives Google an illegal advantage.Google says users prefer links that send them directly to a merchant\u2019s site to buy a product, rather than another comparison-shopping site. Mr. Walker said the company believes its service benefits users and helps European merchants compete against e-commerce giants Amazon and             eBay Inc.       He added that regulators also erred in not considering Amazon and eBay as competitors to Google, pointing to a 2016 study by marketing firm BloomReach that said more than half of internet users start their shopping searches on Amazon.The EU\u2019s fine is more than double what had been the bloc\u2019s previous record penalty for a company it found had abused its market position\u2014a \u20ac1.06 billion fine on Intel Corp. in 2009. While the penalty is larger than many had expected, it\u2019s one Alphabet can easily afford, considering its $92 billion in cash and liquid securities on hand.As part of its decision, the EU ordered Google to treat rival comparison-shopping services equally in its search results, but it left it up to Google to figure out how. Google has 90 days to comply with the order to change its services, or faces penalties of up to 5% of average daily global revenue for each day it doesn\u2019t comply.That could mean no more shopping ads in Europe. More likely, analysts said, Google will propose rebuilding the service. EU regulators may require Google to retool the system in a way that would allow results from competing comparison-shopping sites to get mixed in and be as easy to click through as Google-hosted ads.Losing those ads would deliver a hit to Google revenue. Company executives have repeatedly highlighted the ads in recent quarters as a growth driver for its core search-ad business. Such ads now account for roughly 52% of clicks on retailers\u2019 Google search ads, up from about 25% three years ago, according to digital-marketing firm Merkle Inc.Google will need to comply with the order regardless of any appeals or court action. Google has three months to pay Brussels. If it chooses to appeal, it has the option of transferring a bank guarantee pending the outcome of the appeal.The fine and broad remedy order mark an escalation in Brussels\u2019 fight over whether the Mountain View, Calif., firm has used its dominance as a cudgel to promote its own services at the expense of competitors.They are also the first to come from multiple probes the commission has opened into Google. Three have resulted in formal charges: on comparison shopping, on Google\u2019s Android mobile operating service and on its AdSense advertising service. Google has rejected accusations it breaches EU competition law and said it disagrees with the concerns in other areas.News Corp,       owner of The Wall Street Journal, is an interested third party in the shopping case, meaning it can participate in the investigation. The company has also formally complained to the EU about Google\u2019s handling of news articles in search results.The EU\u2019s decision in the shopping case could expedite its probes into Google\u2019s conduct with other services. Ms. Vestager said the finding of Google\u2019s dominance in search in the shopping case would be a starting point for a legal review in other search services.Tuesday\u2019s move also highlights its divergence with U.S. regulators in their approach to Google. The Federal Trade Commission closed a probe into Google\u2019s search practices in 2013 after the company agreed to voluntary changes. Some firms have been lobbying U.S. regulators to reopen the case.\u2014Jack Nicas contributed to this article.Write to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com and Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'EU Slaps Google With Record Fine.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 15:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-slapped-with-2-7-billion-eu-fine-over-search-results-1498556971", "news_title": "Google Slapped With $2.7 Billion EU Fine Over Search Results", "keywords": " alphabet, eu, european union,google, google eu, google fine,European Union,Alphabet Inc.

The skunk works project has been kept secret even from many employees not directly involved in the product.The approach to so-called clean meat, in development for the last nine months, sets the startup apart from its established competitors, he said.Hampton Creek says it has a \u201cplant library\u201d with species from more than 51 countries, which skilled technicians and robots test in a lab. The plants are tested to create the \u201cmedia\u201d that helps the meat cells grow in a controlled environment.\u201cIf you can\u2019t solve the media problem, you cannot figure out a way to make it sustainable meat and seafood [that\u2019s affordable], if not more affordable,\u201d Mr. Tetrick said. \u201cThere are a lot of challenges. The most significant challenge out of the many challenges is how do you figure out a way for the cells to grow economically and sustainably.\u201dThe San Francisco company, currently valued at $1.1 billion, according to Mr. Tetrick, has raised more than $200 million from investors such as Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund and Powerplant Ventures, including $10 million in the last nine months.Rival meat makers such as Memphis Meats Inc. and Mosa Meat B.V. use serum from unborn calves\u2019 and chicks\u2019 blood to grow cells.But Mr. Tetrick said that process is tedious, expensive and gruesome, and is hampering competitors\u2019 business growth.Several competitors say, however, that they are close to rolling out a similar new approach. Memphis Meats CEO Uma Valeti said that the company plans to replace its animal-based serum with a plant-based alternative \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d and he also expects to eliminate the animal-based approach altogether.\u201cWe\u2019re about 80% there,\u201d Peter Verstrate, CEO of Netherlands-based Mosa Meat, said about its efforts to replace animal-based serum with plants. \u201cWe have tried 400 different media compositions that are non-animal-based,\u201d he said.Producing clean meat is expensive. Memphis Meats, which in March unveiled what it called the first chicken strips grown from self-reproducing cells, estimates that its can grow a pound of chicken for less than $3,000.Both Memphis Meats and Mosa Meat CEO\u2019s said that it will take them about three to five years until they can produce cultured meat for sale. Hampton Creek aims to release its meat product by the end of 2018, Mr. Tetrick said.He declined to say what kind of meat the new product would be made out of, but he said it would cost at most 30% more than the same product from major food manufacturers. Hampton Creek\u2019s goal is simple: aim for a product more affordable and tastier than the animal protein you can find on shelves.Hampton Creek has been dogged with questions about its existing businesses, including a Bloomberg report that the company had employees buy its own product at stores to artificially boost sales. The company denied wrongdoing.In another blow, last week             Target Corp.       began removing Hampton Creek products from its shelves, citing food safety concerns. \u201cPending a full review, Target started a market withdrawal of Hampton Creek products, which are being removed from Target stores and Target.com,\u201d Target said in a statement.In response, a Hampton Creek\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe have robust food safety standards, and as such, we remain confident about the safety of all products we sell and distribute. We look forward to working with Target and the FDA to bring this to a quick resolution.\u201dHampton Creek says it isn\u2019t abandoning its other products\u2014and it touted the growth of its mayonnaise product.\u201cWe\u2019re not planning to shelve anything,\u201d Mr. Tetrick said.

Although the former chancellor of Germany is widely considered to be a political genius, conventional wisdom holds that his economic policy was a failure. It\u2019s time to reassess that view. Kohl was smarter on economics than many professional economists are willing to admit.The arguments that Kohl was a brilliant statesman and a bad economist are closely intertwined. His overarching political goal was to quickly reunify Germany after the collapse of communism in the East and then unite much of Europe under a new single currency.Kohl\u2019s center-left opponent in the 1990 elections,       Oskar Lafontaine,        and many German academics argued against immediate reunification. They believed the East German economy was too different from the West and needed time to adjust. East German companies had outdated products that had no chance of competing in Western markets and market regulations were mostly absent.Kohl ignored his critics. His central economic insight was that reunification would be the cause, not the result, of economic alignment. East Germany\u2019s best hope was to quickly adopt the strong institutions of the West.He has been proved right by history. This is true even of perhaps the most controversial aspect of his reunification policy\u2014the one-to-one conversion of East German marks to deutschemarks. Most German economists argued that this would distort relative prices and destroy the East\u2019s competitiveness. The president of the Bundesbank at the time,       Karl Otto P\u00f6hl,        resigned in protest over Kohl\u2019s decision.But the truth is that East Germany\u2019s economy was obsolete and couldn\u2019t be competitive at any price. No one would have bought a car from the East German auto maker Trabant, or \u201cTrabi,\u201d even at a 10-to-one exchange rate.So Kohl took a different approach. His one-to-one conversion amounted to a large stimulus that helped East Germans survive several years of high unemployment and low incomes as their economy reconfigured along market principles.Kohl wasn\u2019t infallible. He was too optimistic when he promised \u201cblossoming landscapes within a few years.\u201d And he was wrong on labor-market and competition policies during his chancellorship. He raised taxes and expanded the welfare state, which inhibited investment and deteriorated the economy\u2019s international competitiveness.But the economic convergence of the East is a remarkable success. Today the average productivity per capita in what used to be East Germany is around 80% of the West. That compares well to massive regional differences elsewhere in Europe. The north-south economic divide in Italy and Spain today, for instance, is much greater than the east-west divide in Germany.Even the financial transfers to the East of around 30% to 40% of gross domestic product over 25 years seem modest.Central to the economic success of German reunification was the immediate adoption of the West\u2019s institutions\u2014its governance, including both its democracy and its administrative agencies, and also its currency\u2014which forced economic structures and actors to adjust. This gradually and endogenously created an optimal currency area. Kohl intuited that if instead East Germany waited until it was ready to adopt Western institutions, it might never adopt them at all.There is an important lesson here for Europe today. Institutions are more important than relative prices. The eurozone\u2019s problem isn\u2019t that relative prices are wrong, but that it lacks credible institutions and adjustment mechanisms.Just as for East Germany in 1990, the problem of Greece or Italy today isn\u2019t a lack of price competitiveness but one of poor or missing national and European institutions. A weak currency isn\u2019t a durable strategy to ensure competitiveness and prosperity.Eurozone countries have benefited from adopting a strong and credible euro, which has created more favorable financing conditions and more stable prices than most members enjoyed before. And it has deepened trade and competition, benefitting particularly open economies, including Germany\u2019s.Member states should take the lesson from German reunification and focus on reforming domestic institutions as well as completing the monetary union. That requires finally completing Europe\u2019s capital-market and banking unions under a single regulatory structure and creating a fiscal union with both more risk sharing and a stricter adherence to joint rules. Just as in Germany in 1990, sharing sovereignty in Europe today will ultimately make it stronger and more resilient and everyone better off.Helmut Kohl was a visionary, not just about the politics of German reunification and European integration but also on its economics. He didn\u2019t consider the euro the price for German reunification, but as an essential prerequisite for his vision of a strong and united Europe. He lived to see his dream come true for Germany, but not for Europe. It can still come true now.Mr. Fratzscher is president of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) in Berlin.", "news_time": "2017-06-27 15:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/helmut-kohl-was-right-1498592169", "news_title": "Helmut Kohl Was Right", "keywords": " democracy, euro, european union, germany,helmut kohl, trabant, unification,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "After performing in August at the FYF Festival in Los Angeles,       Sam Shepherd,        who writes, records and performs as Floating Points, stopped outside of Joshua Tree National Park in the Mojave Desert to rehearse with his band. So smitten was he with the environment that he decided to practice outdoors, letting the sound reverberate amid the rocks and flora. The music echoed back at the quintet as if delayed electronically, and the rustling wind altered the instruments\u2019 sounds. Intrigued, Mr. Shepherd decided to record his new music in this natural setting.The result is \u201cReflections\u2014Mojave Desert\u201d (Luaka Bop), out on Friday. Mr. Shepherd and group play music that draws from the forward motion, skittish rhythms and synthetic colors of electronica, but their performances also feature elements of prog rock and, with Mr. Shepherd on a Fender Rhodes electric piano, \u201970s jazz and funk. The desert\u2019s ambient sounds are present too, both in their original form\u2014with a parabolic microphone, Mr. Shepherd captured the wind careening through the rock formations\u2014and as electronic samples. Crossing genres with ease, \u201cReflections\u2014Mojave Desert\u201d doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any category and it\u2019s never less than absorbing.The album reflects Mr. Shepherd\u2019s growth as a musician and bandleader. He studied piano at Chetham\u2019s School of Music in Manchester, England, and performed in jazz combos. While studying for his doctorate in neuroscience and epigenetics from University College London, he played piano every day. \u201cMusic was my release from science,\u201d he said when we spoke by phone last week. While an academic environment that encouraged free thought was satisfying, Mr. Shepherd said he never thinks in scientific terms when composing or performing, instead relying, however subconsciously, on earlier musical training.His first singles and EPs are solo efforts\u2014high-quality electronic music that revealed his skills as a pianist as well as a producer. But while recording his first full-length album, 2015\u2019s \u201cElaenia,\u201d Mr. Shepherd said he yearned to play with accomplished musicians rather than make all the sounds himself. Bassist       Susumu Mukai,        guitarist Alex Reeve and drummer       Leo Taylor       sat in on those sessions. Along with guitarist       Matthew Kirkis,        they now constitute Mr. Shepherd\u2019s unit on tour and the new disc. While \u201cElaenia\u201d emerged as a supple collection of jazz-funk, \u201cReflections\u2014Mojave Desert\u201d leans more often toward rock. When Messrs. Kirkis and Reeve send stinging guitar solos above the soundscape, the music soars as Mr. Shepherd, deploying a battery of synthesizers and electric pianos, improvises discreetly and adds accents when the opportunity arises. Though several of the tunes were composed in advance of the recording sessions, Mr. Shepherd said they all rely on improvisation for added life.On \u201cReflections\u2014Mohave Desert,\u201d several songs tilt heavily toward prog rock, particularly \u201cSilurian Blue\u201d and \u201cKelso Dunes,\u201d with Mr. Taylor pounding away effectively in the latter. The 31-year-old Mr. Shepherd told me he knew very little about prog rock; he recently visited the exhibition \u201cPink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains\u201d at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, not so much to learn about their music as to check out their gear from the \u201860s and \u201870s. (He says he now appreciates the band\u2019s \u201cMeddle,\u201d released in \u201971.)Though tracking down hard-to-get albums in U.S. record shops while on tour is a favorite activity, he said, \u201cmy music references are abysmal.\u201d He acquired the 1970 self-titled record by the British jazz-fusion group Affinity, and later, as he was listening to one track, his girlfriend entered the room and began to sing along. When Mr. Shepherd expressed his surprise that she knew such obscure music, she pointed out that Affinity was playing \u201cI Am the Walrus\u201d by the Beatles. Mr. Shepherd had never heard it before.But prog rock and jazz fusion are part of contemporary music\u2019s vocabulary, Mr. Shepherd and band draw from them with ease. Following the mid-2016 stint in the Southern California desert, the band continued to tour, performing the new material. Mr. Shepherd said they grew bolder as improvisation reigned.\u201cReflections\u2014Mojave Desert\u201d is accompanied by a film directed by       Anna Diaz Ortu\u00f1o       that presents scenes from the environment in which the music was recorded. (Keen-eared listeners will note that some of the tracks in the film differ from what\u2019s on the album.) Mr. Shepherd said he and the group will continue to explore recording in various spaces to capture how the setting shapes its music. Drawing for a moment on his background as a scientist, he said the new album is \u201cproof of concept\u201d that his music can be informed by external forces. In the case of \u201cReflections\u2014Mojave Desert,\u201d nature is a co-conspirator, helping Mr. Shepherd and band press his music beyond where it had been before.\u2014Mr. Fusilli is the Journal\u2019s rock and pop music critic.

On Tuesday, Ms. Merkel\u2019s challenger for the chancellorship in the September election,       Martin Schulz       of the center-left Social Democrats, demanded a vote by the end of the week, when the lower house of parliament adjourns for the summer.Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats criticized the swiftness of Mr. Schulz\u2019s move but signaled they wouldn\u2019t try to block a vote. The chancellor repeated in a closed-door meeting with her party\u2019s lawmakers Tuesday that they shouldn\u2019t feel bound by the party line, a person who was in the meeting said.The unexpected flurry of events means that Germany, the European Union\u2019s most populous country, is now on its way to legalizing same-sex marriage after years of opposition by Ms. Merkel\u2019s party.\u2018There are many countries in Europe in which this is already legal reality. This will now happen in Germany.\u2019VIEW InteractiveThe vote is expected to pass the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, where parties that support same-sex marriage control more than half the seats. Because the Social Democrats are the junior partners in Ms. Merkel\u2019s governing coalition, they had so far refrained from acting unilaterally.\u201cThere are many countries in Europe in which this is already legal reality,\u201d       Thomas Oppermann,        the Social Democratic leader in parliament, said Tuesday. \u201cThis will now happen in Germany.\u201dAround a dozen EU countries, including France, Spain and Belgium, allow same-sex marriage.Ms. Merkel was under pressure to update her views on the issue because all her potential coalition partners after the September election\u2014the Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens, and the business-friendly Free Democrats\u2014had voiced their support for same-sex marriage, which polls show a broad majority of Germans approve.\u2018\u2018Marriage\u2019 between two people of the same sex...it will depart fully from the traditional, church understanding of marriage.\u2019The chancellor\u2019s move was the latest example of her ideological flexibility and her willingness to move her conservative party to the center, analysts said. Conservatives in her party, which for years was dominated by Catholics from the western party of the country, have been frustrated by the way Ms. Merkel has strayed from core party dogma, abandoning nuclear energy, ending mandatory military service, and accepting refugees, among other changes.\u201cIf politicians now plan to approve the possibility of \u2018marriage\u2019 between two people of the same sex, it will depart fully from the traditional, church understanding of marriage,\u201d a lawmaker in Ms. Merkel\u2019s party,       Martin Patzelt,        said in a statement. \u201cI believe that changing this position is strategically motivated.\u201dMs. Merkel told lawmakers in their closed-door meeting Tuesday that she had discussed the change in position on same-sex marriage with other party elders before she made her Monday comments, the person who was in the meeting said. She said she would have preferred to have held a vote after the Sept. 24 election, the person said.But her dropping opposition to gay marriage means the parties opposing Ms. Merkel as she seeks a fourth term will have one less issue to campaign on.\u201cThis confirms her strategy: \u2018I don\u2019t want unnecessary disputes,\u2019\u201d said       Gero Neugebauer,        a political scientist in Berlin. \u201cIt takes a point away from the Social Democrats.\u201dAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Germany Opens Path To Vote on Gay Marriage.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 15:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/angela-merkel-opens-way-for-vote-on-gay-marriage-in-germany-1498591143", "news_title": "Angela Merkel Opens Way for Vote on Gay Marriage in Germany ", "keywords": "germany same-sex marriage,Angela Merkel,political,general news,society,community,same-sex marriage,civil union,human rights,civil liberties,lgbt rights,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,marriage,divorce"}, {"content": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill.\u2014This is what happens when a major American state lets its bills stack up for two years.Hospitals, doctors and dentists don\u2019t get paid for hundreds of millions of dollars of patient care.

But the odds of salvaging the existing restructuring deal are thin given that Prepa owes a $453 million debt payment on July 1 to creditors who have grown increasingly mistrustful of the oversight board.The debt agreement, three years in the making, has failed so far to gain sufficient support among the oversight board\u2019s seven voting members, leaving the agreement wobbling on the brink of collapse, The Wall Street Journal reported this month.Members of Congress who wrote Puerto Rico\u2019s federal rescue package and control its relationship with the U.S. are divided on the merits of the deal. Republican Rep.       Rob Bishop       (Utah) said this month the board was powerless to disapprove the settlement, while Democrats       Nydia Velazquez       (N.Y.) and       Raul Grijalva       (Ariz.) said no creditor deal should be off-limits to board review.The territorial government itself has already entered a court-supervised restructuring proceeding in San Juan, where creditors are battling to increase their share of government revenues.Prepa is a political flashpoint in the territory\u2019s financial rehabilitation due to unreliable energy service that drags down economic growth and costs consumers more than in every U.S. state but Hawaii. The oversight board has been searching for ways to bring down power rates that fluctuate based largely on commodity prices.Together, National and Assured guarantee some $2.2 billion in Prepa bonds. Their lawsuit said that Puerto Rico \u201ccannot afford to endure a Prepa bankruptcy that could turn the lights off.\u201dThe potential collapse of the utility deal comes at an inopportune moment for National, which was downgraded by S&P Global Ratings on Monday. Shares in parent MBIA rallied from $8.48 a share to $9 early Tuesday morning on speculation the ratings cut would cause it to seek a buyer for National.Bonds issued by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority have lost value since April, when creditors revised their restructuring terms at the request of Puerto Rico Gov.       Ricardo Rossello,        who sought additional concessions to mitigate politically unpopular rate increases on consumers. Puerto Rico\u2019s rescue law empowered the oversight board to write down Puerto Rico bonds either consensually through negotiated settlements or nonconsensually with the help of the courts.Bondholders under the deal would accept a 15% reduction on their claims in exchange for new debt paid from a special customer surcharge. Critics including local manufacturers say the deal would impose new costs on utility ratepayers that risk stifling economic growth and crowding out private generation projects. Meanwhile, creditors argue that reworking Prepa\u2019s debt will lower costs and bolster its creditworthiness, enticing investment capital to upgrade its outdated generation assets.The oversight board unveiled a counteroffer this week that would further revise the proposed terms, according to a person familiar with the matter. There is no forbearance agreement to prevent an outright default if Prepa doesn\u2019t pay its creditors on July 1, this person said. The oversight board is scheduled to meet publicly in San Juan on Friday.Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 15:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-insurers-sue-puerto-rico-board-to-enforce-9-billion-utility-deal-1498574356", "news_title": "Bond Insurers Sue Puerto Rico Board to Enforce $9 Billion Utility Deal ", "keywords": "assured guaranty ltd.,bankruptcy,debt restructuring, mbia inc.,national public finance guarantee corp.,prepa,puerto rico,restructuring,san juan,Assured Guaranty,AGO,MBIA,MBI,Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority,plans,strategy,corporate actions,bankruptcy reorganization,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,corporate restructuring,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,electricity,gas utilities,insurance,non-life insurance,financial services,guarantee insurance,utilities"}, {"content": "It has been three years since a major new shopping mall opened in the U.S. Despite some early success, the project could be the last of its kind.Luxury mall operator             Taubman Centers Inc.        TCO 0.55%       constructed the 862,000-square-foot Mall at University Town Center in Sarasota, Fla., after years of planning and a number of studies showed the region was underserved by retail and would continue to enjoy population growth.Taubman started working on the project in 2004 but had to pause during the financial crisis, and conducted another study in 2010 before plunging ahead.\u00a0The mall had space for four department stores, but in the end Taubman went with three\u2014            Macy\u2019s,       Saks Fifth Avenue and             Dillard\u2019s                  \u2014and devoted the remaining space to parking.The upscale mall is doing well, thanks in part to strong tenants such as Apple and Tesla Motors, which are reliable traffic generators. Taubman Centers, which doesn\u2019t publish sales numbers for individual malls, said the sales per square foot there is comparable with the average of its entire portfolio, which was around $776 for the year ending in March. Grade A malls typically have sales per square foot above the $600 mark.Despite the strong performance, however, Taubman, a real-estate investment trust based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., doesn\u2019t have any other mall projects planned in the U.S.\u201cWe have every expectation that not many malls are going to be built, but we didn\u2019t expect this to be the last,\u201d said Bill Taubman, chief operating officer of Taubman Centers.Appetite for building enclosed malls of more than 800,000 square feet has dried up.\u00a0Department stores, once dependable foot-traffic generators, are closing locations amid stiff competition from off-price retailers and the growth of online shopping.A mall construction spree in the 1970s and 1980s has left in its wake aging properties at a time when there is little capital available for upgrades. As anchor stores close, more mall space sits idle and foot traffic wanes, hastening the march toward death.In all, there are roughly 1,200 malls in the U.S., and some analysts see the figure bottoming out at 500 to 800.As of the current quarter, there were 612 so-called superregional malls, which typically have a gross floor area of 800,000 square feet or more, only two more than there were in 2010. Between 2002 and 2009, there were 37 such malls built. The number of smaller enclosed malls of 400,000 to 800,000 square feet stands at 599, up by 16 since 2010. Between 2002 and 2009, 40 such malls were constructed.But other categories of retail are flourishing. The number of neighborhood shopping centers and strip centers has jumped by 2,303 since 2010 to 114,683. These centers typically offer a narrower range of goods and feature tenants such as grocery stores, laundromats and other necessity-based services that cater to nearby residents.Grade A malls in dense neighborhoods with above-average household incomes are still doing well, and their landlords argue that consolidation in the industry works in their favor.The Mall at University Town Center, for instance, is benefiting from the recent closure of the Macy\u2019s store at a competing mall, Sarasota Square, located 14 miles south.\u201cMost markets are already served by existing retail centers,\u201d said Mr. Taubman. He said there will be major retail development projects in the future, but with a different model from the boxy, enclosed suburban malls of the past few decades.In the New Jersey Meadowlands, mall owner and developer Triple Five Worldwide Group of Companies is building the American Dream, a long-delayed 3 million-square-foot mall expected to focus mainly on entertainment-focused tenants.Another niche mall project is the Westfield World Trade Center mall located in a transport hub that opened in 2016.But unless department stores figure out a way to reverse their sales slumps, it\u2019s unlikely that many traditional enclosed malls will be built in the years ahead, analysts said.The building of superregional malls has fizzled in part because of retailers pulling back expansion plans.\u201cThere was a time you had a deeper bench of anchors, said       Jeffrey Donnelley,        managing director of real estate and lodging equity research at Wells Fargo. \u201cBut now not all of those anchors are in expansion mode, and even if they were, not every site works for them.\u201dWrite to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'This Mall Could Be the Last of Its Kind.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 14:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/has-america-built-its-last-major-mall-1498589803", "news_title": "Has America Built Its Last Major Mall?

Anyone who isn\u2019t thrilled by the high-wire theatricality of a virtuoso performer needs to have his hypothalamus examined. I also love the Fourth of July, the national holiday on which it\u2019s customary to set off skyrockets of the nonmusical kind. Alas, the classical musicians of today seem increasingly disinclined to display the heart-on-sleeve patriotism that led Van Cliburn to open his recitals with \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d and to play it with the utmost splendor and conviction. Were an American pianist to lead off a recital with the national anthem nowadays, he\u2019d surely toss it off with a slyly ironic wink.This is undoubtedly one of the reasons why I\u2019ve never heard a concert performance of either of the two most spectacular exercises in flag-flying pianistic patriotism that I know,       Louis Moreau Gottschalk\u2019s       \u201cThe Union\u201d and       Vladimir Horowitz\u2019s       transcription of \u201cThe Stars and Stripes Forever.\u201d The other reason is that both pieces are monstrously, knuckle-crunchingly hard to play. But they make for irresistibly pleasurable listening, and you can hear them whenever you want via Amazon or on YouTube.Gottschalk\u2019s given names obscure the fact that he was America\u2019s first important native-born composer. In \u201cThe Union,\u201d composed in 1862, he proudly wore his nationality on his sleeve. The piece\u2019s subtitle, \u201cConcert Paraphrase on National Airs,\u201d situates this seven-minute medley of three patriotic songs in its proper musical context: It\u2019s an all-American version of a Liszt-style operatic fantasy, a showpiece in which familiar melodies are cleverly woven together, then festooned with fantastically complex technical stuntwork. In \u201cThe Union,\u201d though, the melodies are not arias by       Rossini       or       Verdi       but \u201cHail, Columbia,\u201d \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and \u201cYankee Doodle.\u201d Gottschalk chose these songs because he wrote \u201cThe Union\u201d as an act of musical homage to the Northern side in the Civil War. A fervent opponent of slavery, he dedicated \u201cThe Union\u201d to Gen.       George B. McClellan       and, two years later, performed it for       Abraham Lincoln       at the White House.While we don\u2019t know what Lincoln thought of \u201cThe Union,\u201d it\u2019s hard to imagine that he was anything other than delighted by the unabashedly elaborate ruffles and flourishes with which Gottschalk decorated his homely tunes. Were his purpose not so self-evidently sincere, one might almost call the results campy. Indeed, I can\u2019t help but wonder whether       Tony Kushner       might possibly have had \u201cThe Union\u201d in the back of his mind when he subtitled \u201cAngels in America\u201d \u201ca gay fantasia on national themes.\u201d But Gottschalk was both a notorious ladies\u2019 man and a patriot, and it is impossible to doubt the wholeheartedness with which he composed \u201cThe Union.\u201d As any fan of the Fourth of July will hasten to assure you, patriotism can be fun.Vladimir Horowitz brought off a comparable feat of patriotic prestidigitation when he transcribed \u201cThe Stars and Stripes Forever,\u201d the most famous and beloved of       John Philip Sousa\u2019s       137 marches for military band.       Arturo Toscanini,        Horowitz\u2019s father-in-law, started performing \u201cThe Stars and Stripes Forever\u201d with the NBC Symphony in 1943 as a wartime tribute to the U.S. armed forces. Horowitz, a refugee from Soviet Russia who became a naturalized U.S. citizen the following year, heard a Toscanini performance and decided to arrange the march as a gesture of gratitude to his new-found homeland. The results were an instant hit when he unveiled the piece in Minneapolis in 1945.For pianists, the most remarkable aspect of the transcription comes in the repeat of the march\u2019s trio section, in which a solo piccolo plays a sparkling obbligato over the second theme (long known to children of all ages as \u201cBe kind to your web-footed friends / For a duck may be somebody\u2019s mother\u201d). In one of his most sensational pieces of fingerwork, Horowitz simultaneously plays the theme, the piccolo obbligato and the oom-pah accompaniment\u2014with only two hands. (Pro tip: He plays the theme with his thumbs.) Then he does it all over again, this time cranking up the volume so high that you\u2019d swear you were hearing a brass band.Horowitz never published his \u201cStars and Stripes Forever\u201d transcription, but various admirers have taken it down by ear, and at least one of their versions is available in sheet-music form. Don\u2019t bother trying to play it yourself, though, unless you\u2019re a super-virtuoso\u2014or unless you happen to have three hands. Better to listen agog to Horowitz\u2019s 1951 recording, or to       Leonard Pennario\u2019s       equally spectacular 1974 recorded performance of \u201cThe Union.\u201d Fireworks have never sounded so good.\u2014Mr. Teachout, the Journal\u2019s drama critic, writes \u201cSightings,\u201d a column about the arts, every other week.

Daniels\u2019 report stopped short of looking at the organization\u2019s actions in specific cases\u2014including a wave of sexual assault claims made against the women\u2019s Olympic team physician Larry Nassar and civil litigation against the organization in California and Michigan.The sweeping set of 70 recommendations painted an ugly picture of the circumstances that have rocked USA Gymnastics, prompting the resignation of its president, casting a cloud over its run of Olympic glories in 2012 and 2016, and leaving its future uncertain.USA Gymnastics said its board unanimously accepted the report, recommendations, and a new policy to protect the welfare of participants.Board chairman Paul Parilla said he offered \u201cour deepest regrets\u201d that athletes had been harmed but did not address the report\u2019s specific findings.\u201cUSA Gymnastics is very sorry that anyone has been harmed during his or her gymnastics career, and we offer our deepest regrets to any athlete who suffered abuse or mistreatment while participating in the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are determined to do better.\u201dDaniels\u2019s report called for USA Gymnastics\u2019 board to take a more active and independent approach to overseeing the organization and\u2014in one of many rebukes of the organization\u2019s leadership under former president Steve Penny\u2014called out the \u201cexcessive\u201d and at times \u201cinappropriate power\u201d the president has over the organization.Penny resigned earlier this year under pressure from the U.S. Olympic Committee, after 12 years in charge; he received an approximately $1 million severance package when he left in March. In a statement Tuesday, he said \u201cthe gymnastics community is filled with people who care about the safety of the young athlete, and recognize that a safe environment is a prerequisite to enjoyment and success in the sport. I am hopeful and optimistic that the Daniels report helps USA Gymnastics build on the previous efforts of the organization.\u201dFormer Olympic champion Dominique Moceanu, a longtime critic of the gymnastics federation and the abusive atmosphere that has pervaded the sport\u2019s elite levels, said the report should have come out a decade ago. She criticized USA Gymnastics for only taking the step to pursue an independent investigation not by choice, but rather in the face of public pressure from the controversy surrounding Dr. Nassar.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for that, they would have let all this other stuff go and been happy,\u201d Moceanu said of the federation\u2019s leaders. \u201cThey have lost a lot of trust in the community, and it\u2019s going to take them a long time to gain it back.\u201dThe report described the potential for a \u201cfollower\u201d mentality among board members, with few in-person meetings, and a perception that had arisen that the board\u2019s members were a self-perpetuating clique with limited experience or willingness to address issues such as preventing child abuse.Conflicts of interest are also a problem, the report said. While board members are not paid for their service, they may receive payment from USA Gymnastics for other services performed on the organization\u2019s behalf.The board\u2019s \u201cindependence, and its ability to hold USA Gymnastics\u2019 management accountable for meaningful actions to protect children, can be threatened when a member of the Board is reliant on USA Gymnastics for income,\u201d the report said.This finding was bolstered by a review of board meetings, according to the report, which found that the board\u2019s \u201cEthics, Grievance and Safe Sport\u201d committee of the board \u201cappears\u2026to spend much of its time reviewing compensation arrangements of Board members to determine whether to permit them under the Board\u2019s conflicts of interest policy.\u201d\u201cWe see no focus on the existence of reports of misconduct, the conduct of investigations of reported misconduct, or the resolution of such investigations,\u201d the report said.It also said the organization had been incorrect in its assumption that it could not do more to require member gyms to screen coaches they hired or demand they adhere to stricter guidelines about physical and isolated contact with child athletes. The report called on the board to do more now.The report said that some of the national governing body\u2019s employees had been promoted because of \u201cfamiliarity rather than qualifications,\u201d and said the entire process by which they handled allegations of abuse had to change.Daniels\u2019s report said USA Gymnastics and every adult involved in the sport had previously operated under rules that said they \u201cmay notify\u201d the governing body if abuse was suspected, with officials often believing they could only take reports directly from a victim or victim\u2019s parents, and sometimes attempting to investigate them themselves first.Going forward, every adult in the sport must notify law enforcement \u201cpromptly\u201d if they have any reason to believe abuse may have occurred, or have their membership of the organization revoked, the report said.The Wall Street Journal reported in February that USA Gymnastics had waited five weeks to report a national team member\u2019s concerns about Nassar to law enforcement, after conducting its own investigation first.\u201cA delay is impermissible,\u201d Daniels said Monday evening, adding that in her definition, \u201cpromptly\u201d should mean \u201cnot even hours\u201d go by, and that \u201cyou don\u2019t go and investigate it\u201d first.Daniels\u2019s report also called for changes to the role played by the organization\u2019s president, particularly in responding to member claims of abuse, saying that in the new process the president should not be allowed to have a \u201ccontrolling role in determining disposition of allegations.\u201dDaniels said the entire culture of gymnastics had left athletes vulnerable to abuse.\u201cEverything about this environment, while understandable in the context of a highly competitive Olympic sport, tends to suppress reporting of inappropriate activity,\u201d the report said.\u201cThe athlete and her parents are not certain what behavior is inappropriate; the athlete is expected to bear pain and emotional stress without complaint; the young female athlete in particular is highly desirous of gaining the approval of adult authority figures; and the athlete\u2019s opportunity for success in competition hinges on pleasing her coach,\u201d the report said.Among specific changes, Daniels said that the national team\u2019s training center at the Karolyi Ranch\u2014deep in a national forest outside Houston\u2014needed to watch more closely over gymnasts as young as 11, training there without their parents, and make it possible for them to call home despite the lack of reliable cellular service there. She specifically called on the group to stop using a treatment room in an isolated area \u201cpotentially conducive to abuse\u201d in favor of a more centrally located common room, at which multiple people should be present at any time.The report also concluded that even the national team selection process should change, to ensure athletes did not fear retaliation for speaking out.\u201cElite gymnastics is not truly a team environment; while some friendships form, each individual is in competition with every other individual gymnast. In this environment, it is highly unlikely that the athletes themselves will report abusive activity to others. In addition, we have learned that some athletes who did report abuse were ostracized by coaches, fellow athletes and even those athletes\u2019 parents, who either did not believe the reports or simply did not want a popular and purportedly effective coach sidelined,\u201d the report said.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 14:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/usa-gymnastics-report-calls-for-sweeping-changes-in-wake-of-sexual-abuse-scandal-1498578053", "news_title": "USA Gymnastics Report Calls for Sweeping Changes in Wake of Sexual Abuse Scandal", "keywords": "gymnastics,usa gymnastics,USA Gymnastics,political,general news,child abuse,society,community,crime,legal action,olympics,sex crimes,social issues,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for the U.S. economy Tuesday, saying it could no longer assume the Trump administration will be able to deliver pledged tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending.The IMF, in its annual review of the American economy, questioned the White House\u2019s plan to accelerate output and said it was skeptical the administration would be able rev up the world\u2019s largest growth engine to a sustained 3% annual rate.That target is \u201can extremely optimistic growth assumption,\u201d the IMF\u2019s economists said.Instead, the fund forecasts the growth rate will steadily fall over the next five years to around 1.7%, assuming no major policy changes.In April, the IMF said President Donald Trump\u2019s tax-overhaul plans and spending stimulus could boost the growth rate to 2.5% next year, up from 2.3% this year. But after talks with administration officials amid still-evolving policy plans, the fund says it can no longer factor such fiscal stimulus into its forecasts. The IMF now says the economy will expand by 2.1% this year and next.The White House and congressional leadership are still looking at a tax overhaul this year. But initial optimism about the administration\u2019s ability to get a tax revamp and infrastructure spending has faded in the face of mounting political hurdles.Meanwhile, buoyant stock prices, one of the longest expansions in U.S. history and a precrisis jobless rate belie an economy facing considerable challenges ahead, the fund warned.Technology is reshaping product and labor markets, but productivity growth isn\u2019t picking up. An aging workforce is keeping a lid on labor-market expansion, a growth-sapping dynamic that may be exacerbated by more restrictive immigration policies. High government debt prevents spending-led stimulus. And a strong dollar\u2014estimated by the IMF to be 10% to 20% over a value economic fundamentals warrant\u2014is weighing on U.S. competitiveness.\u201cAll in all, in our judgment, the U.S. economic model is not working as well as it could in generating broadly shared income growth,\u201d said       Alejandro Werner,        head of the IMF\u2019s Western Hemisphere department.The Trump administration says its economic platform\u2014including cutting corporate and income taxes, boosting infrastructure spending and reducing regulations\u2014will push growth up to a sustained rate of 3% to 4% a year and cut unhealthy government debt levels.The IMF disagreed, questioning whether the package as proposed will deliver the administration\u2019s long-term growth targets, balance the budget and cut public debt.\u201cEven with an ideal constellation of progrowth policies, the potential growth dividend is likely to be less than that projected in the budget and will take longer to materialize,\u201d the IMF said. International experience and U.S. history suggest a sustained acceleration in annual growth of more than 1 percentage point is unlikely, the IMF said.The U.S. Treasury said in a statement Tuesday, \u201cWe appreciate the IMF\u2019s support of the administration\u2019s broad policy objectives, including the need to stimulate infrastructure investment, simplify the tax system, and boost educational opportunities.\u201dThe fund backs an overhaul of the U.S. tax code, cutting corporate taxes, and getting rid of exemptions. It also supports budget belt-tightening to slim the deficit and trim public debt, and boosting infrastructure spending. But the fund says the administration\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t add up.\u201cThe consultation revealed differences on a range of policies and left open questions as to whether the administration\u2019s proposed policy strategies are best suited to achieve their intended purpose,\u201d the fund said.To put the country\u2019s finances back on a healthy path, the IMF said, some sort of consumption tax would be necessary, such as a tax on carbon emissions or gasoline. And, it said, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed budget cuts would disproportionately affect the poor and middle class and should be moderated.The fund also warned against a White House plan to invoke national security to raise tariffs on steel imports, saying there was room for renegotiating trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement in a way that was mutually beneficial.\u201cThe U.S. ought to be judicious in its use of import restrictions on national security grounds and avoid measures that inadvertently weaken, rather than strengthen, the overall economy,\u201d it said.Given the weaknesses in the economy, the fund said the Federal Reserve should aim to temporarily overshoot its 2% inflation target by gradually easing into its planned interest-rate increases.Write to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 14:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-lowers-forecast-for-u-s-economy-amid-rising-policy-uncertainty-1498568402", "news_title": "IMF Lowers Forecast for U.S. Economy Amid Rising Policy Uncertainty ", "keywords": " american economy, growth, growth projections,imf, infrastructure, international monetary fund, tax plan, us economy,us treasury,Federal Reserve,International Monetary Fund,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,government finance,government budget,taxation,government borrowing,economic news"}, {"content": "Prominent hedge-fund investor       Steven A.

His recommendations include a formal margin target, more share buybacks and a sale of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s stake in French cosmetics giant L\u2019Or\u00e9al SA.Mr. Loeb began amassing shares in Nestl\u00e9 early this year, according to a person familiar with the matter, and now owns 1.25% of the company making him Nestl\u00e9\u2019s fourth-biggest shareholder. Nestl\u00e9 shares jumped following Mr. Loeb\u2019s letter, which promised the company\u2019s growth and earnings would \u201cdramatically improve\u201d if his recommendations were followed.\u201cAll seems to have happened very quickly, but probably not a huge surprise given the strength of the balance sheet and pressure from Third Point and others,\u201d said Jon Cox, head of Swiss equities at Kepler Cheuvreux.Nestl\u00e9 applied for Swiss regulatory approval of its share buyback last week, and received the go-ahead on Tuesday.Under new Chief Executive       Mark Schneider,        Nestl\u00e9 has already dropped a sales-growth target that investors had labeled as outdated after the company fell short for four straight years. Mr. Schneider also recently said Nestl\u00e9 would look to sell its U.S. confectionery business, which lags behind rivals             Hershey Co.      , Mars Inc. and             Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Spruengli AG      .Nestl\u00e9 on Tuesday indicated it could make more divestitures, saying it \u201cwill continue to adjust its portfolio in line with its strategy and growth objectives.\u201d There have been calls for Nestl\u00e9 to consider selling its frozen-food arm, which includes brands like Lean Cuisine and Stouffer\u2019s, another business that has struggled as consumers increasingly look to fresh options. Mr. Loeb suggested that Nestl\u00e9 sell its 23% stake in L\u2019Or\u00e9al.Nestl\u00e9 will kick off a share buyback of up to 20 billion Swiss francs next week that will run through June 2020. In addition to investing in beverages, infant nutrition and other high-growth categories, the company said it would also look to make acquisitions in consumer health care that \u201cbuild on\u201d the faster-growing parts of its core food and drinks business. It didn\u2019t specifically refer to its frozen and prepared-foods business, although Nestl\u00e9 is the world\u2019s largest packaged-food company.\u201cThe company is likely to exit more commoditized packaged food in favor of nutrition,\u201d Mr. Cox said.The Vevey, Switzerland-based company said it would examine ways to boost margins through cost cuts but cautioned that it would not do so at the expense of its growth categories.Mr. Schneider has criticized as unsustainable the aggressive cost-cutting that Brazilian investment firm 3G has backed for companies it owns, like             Kraft Heinz Co.       and             Anheuser-Busch InBev                   NV. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s announcement on Tuesday echoes that of rival             Unilever                   PLC, which in April unveiled a \u20ac5 billion ($5.7 billion) share buyback and plans to sell its spreads division after fending off a takeover approach by Kraft.Nestl\u00e9, Unilever and other consumer-goods stalwarts have struggled to deliver the consistent growth that investors had come to expect. The industry headwinds include weaker global growth, volatile currencies and interest rates, higher commodity costs, rapidly changing consumer tastes and difficulty raising prices in a low-inflation environment.Nestl\u00e9 said the buyback could be curtailed should it make a big acquisition before 2020 and that most of the monthly share repurchases will be made in 2019 and 2020 to allow it to pursue deals. The buyback is Nestl\u00e9\u2019s biggest since 2007. It has bought back 47 billion francs in shares since 2005.The company said it had been examining its capital structure and ways to deliver higher shareholder returns since the start of the year, when Mr. Schneider became CEO.Mr. Loeb has had several conversations with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s investor-relations team, and more recently met with Mr. Schneider to convey his recommendations, according a person familiar with those talks. Third Point declined to comment on Tuesday.Corrections & Amplifications   Nestl\u00e9 will buy back up to $20.8 billion of its shares.

GOOGL 0.59%       But the implications of the case are anything but puny for Google and other tech giants.Antitrust experts and tech executives say the EU\u2019s \u20ac2.42 billion ($2.71 billion) ruling against Google\u2019s search engine could be precedent-setting for a host of other products and services.One prominent possibility: the voice-enabled assistant, which many tech executives are betting will replace the search engine. Silicon Valley executives regularly talk about a future of \u201cambient tech,\u201d where digital assistants slowly replace all of our devices and answers come from Google\u2019s digital assistant, or others like             Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s        AMZN 0.24%       Alexa or             Apple Inc.\u2019s        AAPL 0.63%       Siri.At issue in Tuesday\u2019s decision is the EU\u2019s contention that Google must give \u201cequal treatment\u201d in its search results to businesses that might compete with the company in other ways.Because the EU says Google\u2019s search engine is dominant, the bloc says it is illegal for Google to hurt shopping competitors by putting its own product ads for, say, new barbecue grills, on top of any search results from other sites that offer links to buy the same products.Now, imagine a world where relevant grills come not atop a written list, but as suggestions in users\u2019 ears.In the U.S., Amazon has more than 25 million users for its voice-enabled Echo speaker devices, giving it 71% of the smart-speaker market, ahead of Google Home, which has 24%, according to research firm eMarketer. Earlier this month, Apple announced its own smart speaker device called HomePod. Including smartphones with voice assistants, research firm Ovum predicts that there will be some 7.5 billion digital assistant devices in use globally by 2021, up from 3.5 billion in 2016.A spokesman for             Microsoft Corp.      , which operates the voice assistant Cortana, declined to comment. Spokesmen for             Facebook Inc.,       Amazon and Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.There are big hurdles to subjecting digital assistants to antitrust scrutiny. In particular, antitrust regulators would have to determine that one of them is dominant in a certain market for them to be able abuse that dominance.In the wake of the decision, the EU said it was planning to explore how it could apply elsewhere. And       Margrethe Vestager,        the EU\u2019s competition chief, has said she thinks voice-enabled assistants are the next frontier for online search.\u201cWe\u2019re on the brink of doing more oral search, which of course poses new challenges, when it comes to enabling people to have a choice, when it comes to search results, to make sure they get the right answer to their queries,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in a March interview. \u201cWhich is why, instead of being specific on page design or screen design, I think it\u2019s very important to focus on how to allow competition, how to enable that to happen.\u201dIn three cases over the past two years, the EU has made charges against Google ranging from complaints that it abused the dominance of its operating system Android to force phone makers to promote Google\u2019s mobile applications, to complaints it restricted how a website that offers a Google search function can show advertisements sold by other companies. Google is fighting or responding to all these charges and complaints.News Corp,       owner of The Wall Street Journal, is an interested third party in the shopping case, meaning it can participate in the investigation. The company has also formally complained to the EU about Google\u2019s handling of news articles in search results.Complainants in Tuesday\u2019s decision, including Yelp Inc., are hoping the shopping case will have broader implications for Google. Complainants also say the precedent should extend to technologies from other companies.\u201cThe principles in this decision are likely to be employed in the digital-assistant context,\u201d said       Thomas Vinje,        a lawyer for FairSearch, a group of complainants against Google. \u201cThese technologies seem likely to be an important part of our lives going forward, and the application of these principles to results delivered by voice assistants is extremely important.\u201dUnaffiliated experts also believe the questions raised in this Google case will be sticking around for some time. \u201cSoftware platforms with functions attached to them are going to be the future of every kind of product,\u201d said       Keith Hylton,        an antitrust professor at Boston University. \u201cThis whole issue is going to multiply.\u201d\u2014Natalia Drozdiak contributed to this article.Write to Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 14:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-big-european-fine-could-be-just-the-start-for-silicon-valley-1498568666", "news_title": "Google\u2019s Big European Fine Could Be Just the Start for Silicon Valley", "keywords": " eu, european union,google, google fine, vetagher,Amazon.com,AMZN,Apple,AAPL,Alphabet Inc.

Several funds in Europe\u2019s nascent market for shareholder activism are already creating a nuisance for the region\u2019s companies for much less money.A number of managers have recently made trades in which they\u2019ve snapped-up shares in a European company controlled by a larger owner\u2014often one trying to buy up the remaining shares of that company.Using tactics ranging from letters to the board to threats of legal action, funds often allege unfair or abusive practices by the majority owner that they say could depress the value of their stakes. One possible outcome is that the bigger owner, either on merit, or simply to put matters to bed, buys out the investor at a favorable price.Hedge funds\u2019 calls for change are often strengthened because rules in some European countries can offer minority shareholders greater protection than they may be afforded elsewhere.\u201cThe bet by the activist is that the bidder has got so much face invested in the company, are they really not going to pay an extra few percent?\u201d said a senior executive at one of Europe\u2019s largest hedge funds, which runs more than $10 billion in assets.Elliott Advisors, the European affiliate of       Paul Singer\u2019s       Elliott Management Corp., is involved in a number of such battles. These include a dispute with Japanese electronics maker             Hitachi Ltd.      , the majority owner of Italian rail signaling firm STS Ansaldo.STS didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.The hedge fund, which this year set up a website to put forward its case, has highlighted what it says \u201cappears to be the collusive nature\u201d of Hitachi\u2019s purchase. \u201cHitachi has vigorously contested this claim at each possible occasion. No evidence of collusion has ever been provided,\u201d said a Hitachi spokesman.Paris-based activist CIAM, already involved in a long-running legal dispute with             Walt Disney Co.       over its actions in relation to Euro Disney, has this month filed a criminal lawsuit over the way Altice NV has used the assets of telecoms company SFR Group, which it majority owns. Last month CIAM wrote to SFR\u2019s board, expressing concerns about a fee it said would be paid to use Altice\u2019s brand. A spokesman for Altice said this issue had been \u201canswered in a precise and complete manner without raising any comment\u201d from CIAM.\u201cMajority shareholders often consider that minority shareholders don\u2019t exist,\u201d said       Catherine Berjal,        CEO of CIAM, speaking more broadly. \u201cWe have to remind them that they do.\u201d She said the proportion of her portfolio focused on minority rights trades had risen in recent years.Reade Griffith,        who is founding partner at London-based Polygon Global Partners LLP and who runs $850 million in event-driven assets, said minority-rights trades was an area he currently sees as particularly attractive.\u201cEuropean regulatory regimes are generally more protective of minority shareholders than you see in U.S. We keep a particularly close eye on changes in the ownership stakes of majority shareholders as part of our investment process,\u201d said Mr. Griffith.While individual situations will vary, these trades can be particularly attractive when markets are rising and the economy is improving, as has been the case in a resurgent Europe since the start of the year. A large investor trying to buy a majority stake or the entire company may be a signal to a hedge fund that the target company\u2019s underlying business is improving more quickly than the market realizes.Meanwhile, rules in Europe, while fragmented across countries, tend to give smaller shareholders more protection than in the U.S. Thresholds at which minority shareholders can be forcibly \u2018squeezed out\u2019 of a company tend to be higher.\u201cA rising economy, in which people and companies are more confident about what\u2019s going on and where financing is readily available, is a perfect environment for squeezeouts,\u201d said       Christopher Rossbach,        managing partner of London-based investment company J. Stern & Co. Squeezeouts is a term sometimes used to describe these trades.Europe could see more of such trades because the different rules in different countries make for greater opportunities for arbitrage, he said. \u201cInvestors are getting better at understanding and standing up for their rights,\u201d he said.In Europe\u2014traditionally seen as hard work for little return for activists\u2014campaigns are on the rise, helped by cheap valuations and a greater willingness among institutional investors to cooperate with activists.Last year 61 companies in mainland Europe were publicly subjected to activist demands, according to data firm Activist Insight, up from 48 the previous year and 28 in 2014. So far this year, as of June 26, 35 companies have already been targeted.\u2014David Benoit contributed to this article.Write to Laurence Fletcher at laurence.fletcher@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Activist Funds Take Aim at Europe.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 14:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-activists-see-more-opportunities-in-european-companies-1498587442", "news_title": "Hedge Fund Activists See More Opportunities in European Companies", "keywords": " activists,hedge funds, minority shareholders, shareholder activists,Elliott Management,Nestle,Third Point,Hitachi,JP:6501,Walt Disney,DIS,Altice N.V.

The other half is earmarked for a separate victim compensation fund administered by the Justice Department that plans to distribute money to thousands of indirect investors who lost money in the Ponzi scheme but didn\u2019t recover anything in bankruptcy court.Bernard Madoff is now serving a 150-year federal prison sentence related to the Ponzi scheme.The bankruptcy trustee had filed a lawsuit demanding the return of more than $153 million in allegedly tainted funds from the brothers, who were executives at Bernard Madoff\u2019s firm. In July 2014, a third amended version of the complaint alleged that they deleted or altered records during an audit to conceal the fraud from regulators. It added information that the trustee said demonstrated the brothers\u2019 complicity in the fraud and how they allegedly benefited from it by engaging in an array of sham transactions.The judge presiding over Mr. Picard\u2019s liquidation is slated to consider approving the settlement on July 26.The Justice Department fund that would receive the other half of the money has roughly $4 billion earmarked for victims but hasn\u2019t paid out anything more than four years after its creation. Its administrator, former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman       Richard Breeden,        announced this month that payments would begin flowing later this year, without offering an exact date.Unlike Mr. Picard, Mr. Breeden plans to distribute money to individuals who invested in the Ponzi scheme indirectly through feeder funds and other pooled vehicles. Hedge funds who bought victims\u2019 recovery rights have lobbied the Justice Department to change its distribution model to more closely match Mr. Picard\u2019s, the Wall Street Journal reported this month.

S -0.47%      , two big cable operators,             Comcast Corp.        CMCSA 0.41%       and             Charter Communications Inc.,        CHTR 0.57%       are seeking the ability to sell Sprint\u2019s wireless service under their own brands.Such reseller offerings allow a company to provide wireless service without owning or operating a network. There are dozens of companies in the U.S. that piggyback on others\u2019 networks. These include TracFone and Straight Talk, which run on multiple carriers, and Consumer Cellular, which uses AT&T Inc. and             T-Mobile US Inc.These arrangements are becoming increasingly important as bigger companies with more serious wireless ambitions consider offering them.The companies that act as mobile virtual-network operators, or MVNOs, traditionally don\u2019t invest in network improvements because, as resellers of cellular service, they don\u2019t own the infrastructure.The big four carriers dictate prices so there is a limit to how low resellers can set their own fees. Some high-profile MVNOs failed years ago, including earlier attempts by cable companies.In the U.S., MVNOs manage the wireless connections for 38 million devices. T-Mobile is the biggest provider of connections to resellers with 12 million, followed by Sprint with 5 million, according to UBS.For wireless carriers, MVNO agreements offer an additional source of revenue but the decision to enter into one can be tricky. Providing lines to an MVNO is highly profitable because the wireless carriers don\u2019t have to pay for marketing or acquisition costs. But an MVNO\u2019s customers don\u2019t bring in as much revenue as customers who sign up directly.A carrier could even find itself losing its own subscribers to a popular MVNO using its own network.In 2015, Google launched an MVNO called Project Fi. Unlike other MVNOs, Project Fi loads special software on its phones that allows devices to bounce between Sprint and T-Mobile networks, depending on which carrier has the faster connection. The goal is to encourage the carriers to build fast networks.When Sprint decided to sign on with Google, it didn\u2019t take the decision lightly. But the fear was that if Sprint didn\u2019t do the deal, one of the other three carriers would, The Wall Street Journal has reported.Earlier this year, Comcast launched an MVNO that uses             Verizon Communications Inc.\u2019s       network, and Charter says it plans to launch a similar MVNO soon.Verizon agreed to enter into MVNO deals with the cable operators in 2011 as part of a $3.6 billion agreement to buy access to wireless airwaves the firms owned.Comcast and Charter already play a major role in the U.S. wireless industry thanks to their ubiquitous Wi-Fi networks, which many people have in their homes via their cable broadband internet connections. They could gain an edge on telecom rivals by marketing \u201cquad play\u201d service with an MVNO on top of phone, TV and broadband.Write to Ryan Knutson at ryan.knutson@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Wireless Reseller Model Is Spotty.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 13:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-a-sprint-deal-with-comcast-and-charter-would-mean-for-the-wireless-industry-1498586112", "news_title": "What a Sprint Deal With Comcast and Charter Would Mean for the Wireless Industry", "keywords": "cable wireless deal,charter,comcast,mvno,quad play,sprint,straight talk,telecom,telecom news,tracfone,Charter Communications ,CHTR,Comcast,CMCSA,Sprint,S,T-Mobile US,TMUS,marketing,markets,branding,corporate,industrial news,generic products,telecommunication services,wireless telecommunications services,mobile telecommunications,internet service providers (discontinued from 11th july 2017),broadcasting,cable broadcasting,internet,online,media,entertainment,technology"}, {"content": "As Maine lawmakers try to avoid a government shutdown, they are debating whether to keep a new tax on high-income earners that voters backed seven months ago.If lawmakers can\u2019t hash out a deal during budget negotiations before the fiscal year ends Friday night, the state known as \u201cVacationland\u201d risks shutting down just ahead of Independence Day.So lawmakers in Maine, where the legislature is closely split between Democrats and Republicans, will have to decide soon what to do with a 3% additional tax on household income topping $200,000 that voters endorsed in November to help pay for education. The tax went into effect Jan. 1.State House and Senate Republicans as well as Republican Gov.       Paul LePage       want to eliminate the tax, while Democrats want to retain it but have offered to lower the rate.Mr. LePage said Tuesday he was willing to risk a shutdown to avoid passing a two-year budget he believes would cause lasting damage. In his weekly message Tuesday, Mr. LePage called it a \u201cjob-killing surtax\u201d that he said was already affecting small businesses. \u201cI believe we\u2019re going to shut down Friday night,\u201d he said on a radio show.\u201cWe\u2019re in a very precarious place right now,\u201d said       Sara Gideon,        the Democratic speaker of the Maine House, in an interview late Monday. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t been able to land on an agreement.\u201dA spokeswoman for the speaker said the impasse continued on Tuesday after a morning meeting among a conference group including leaders from both legislative chambers.The debate over taxing the wealthy is also percolating in other states. In Massachusetts, lawmakers recently voted to put a proposed surtax on income over $1 million on the 2018 ballot. Meanwhile, in Connecticut, Democratic Gov.       Dannel Malloy       has backed off from additional taxes on higher income earners because previous increases haven\u2019t solved the state\u2019s persistent fiscal problems.In Maine, the conflict goes back to a ballot referendum last November in which voters endorsed adding the high-income tax with the goal of raising $320 million for education funding over two years. The National Education Association, a union with more than three million members, was a significant financial backer for the campaign.Detractors of the tax, including the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, which urges an outright repeal, say the tax will hurt small businesses and harm a tight labor market. The tax pushed Maine\u2019s top marginal individual income-tax rate to 10.15%, the second highest state rate after California, according to data compiled by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation. Many businesses pay taxes through their owner\u2019s individual returns instead of through the corporate tax and thus would be affected by the increase.\u201cThis tax gives our competition in other states an edge in recruiting,\u201d said       Melissa Smith,        chief executive at             Wex Inc.,       a payment-processing firm based in South Portland, Maine.Supporters, meanwhile, argued it would force Maine to finally live up to another voter-backed measure from 2004 that the state keeps missing: a requirement that state government cover 55% of the tab for education.When the state misses its education-funding target, \u201cyou either cut back on programs for kids, you don\u2019t maintain your schools, or you raise property taxes, which is a real regressive burden for middle-class families,\u201d said       Ethan Strimling,        the Democratic mayor of Portland, Maine\u2019s largest city. He supports the new tax.Proposals to scrap the tax irk supporters who say this violates the will of Mainers who went to the voting booth last November.\u201cWe\u2019re going to defend what the people voted on,\u201d said       John Kosinski,        the campaign manager at Stand Up for Students, the ballot-initiative group. He is also legislative director for the Maine Education Association.The situation remains fluid as both sides negotiate.The House GOP said their recent proposal would repeal the 3% tax altogether while raising $125 million in new education funding over the two-year budget. A recent Democratic offer would lower the tax to 1.75% while raising the income threshold to $300,000 with a goal of raising $200 million over two years, said Ms. Gideon, the House speaker.There is room to negotiate and close the gap, \u201cbut we have to be in the realm of fulfilling the spirit of what the voters\u201d supported, she said. Democrats are also pushing for a stable funding source.A spokeswoman for the Senate Republican Office\u2014the GOP holds a narrow majority in that chamber\u2014said they have presented a budget proposal that includes a $110 million education-funding boost without the 3% tax. The Senate GOP plan also includes $65 million in funding for other priorities that could also be applied to education, she said.The Senate Republican Office is confident lawmakers can meet the Friday deadline and avoid a state shutdown if all parties remain willing to negotiate, the spokeswoman said.State rules require the budget pass with two-thirds majority, which means enough to override a veto from Mr. LePage, but if he waits long enough to issue that veto, the shutdown could still happen.

But collecting the judgment, which the victims won by default when Iran failed to respond, has proven difficult.Federal law generally follows age-old international doctrines that shield governments from liability in foreign courts. Congress has, however, carved out narrow exceptions, including provisions that in limited circumstances can allow suits against foreign governments over terror attacks.Frustrated at several turns, the victims, who filed their suit in Illinois, focused their attention on several collections of Persian antiquities that, starting in the 1930s, were lent or acquired by two Chicago museums, the University of Chicago\u2019s Oriental Institute and the Field Museum of Natural History. They sought to seize the artifacts, alleging they were Iranian property that could be taken to satisfy their judgment.The artifacts principally at issue are known as the Persepolis Collection, after the magnificent city founded by the Persian emperor Darius the Great in the Sixth Century B.C. and destroyed by Alexander the Great in 331 B.C.Iran lent the collection to the Oriental Institute in 1937 \u201cfor research, translation, and cataloging, and nearly all of the collection has remained in the possession of the Oriental Institute since then,\u201d the University of Chicago said in legal papers. It includes some 30,000 clay tablets and fragments that \u201ccontain some of the oldest examples of human writing in the world.\u201dLower courts have sided with the museums. Among other reasons, the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found last year that the artifacts didn\u2019t qualify for an exception to foreign immunity because the Iranian government wasn\u2019t using the artifacts for commercial activities.The court, in an opinion by Judge Diane Sykes, rejected the victims\u2019 argument that Congress had authorized seizure of assets used by any entity, including the museums, for commercial activities, rather than solely by the foreign government itself.The Supreme Court agreed to review whether the statute allows attachment of assets used by third-parties.The Trump administration urged the justices to hear the appeal, but in its brief, the Justice Department sided with the museums and the Iranian government to argue that artifacts cannot be seized.Because another appeals court, the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, has reached a different conclusion in another terror victims lawsuit, the government said the justices should hear the case to resolve the issue in line with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s approach.The case, Rubin v.

That fight includes a separate lawsuit filed by             Apple Inc.        AAPL 0.63%       against Qualcomm which makes legal arguments similar to the U.S. government\u2019s.Judge Koh\u2019s decision that the government\u2019s case could move forward rejected Qualcomm\u2019s claim, filed in April in a Northern California federal district court, that the FTC\u2019s complaint failed to support even basic elements of an antitrust violation.The FTC says Qualcomm, whose technology is used in almost all smartphones,\u00a0acts unfairly by refusing to sell its chips to handset makers that don\u2019t buy a license to use its patents\u2014which are deemed essential to cellular communications\u2014and by refusing to sell licenses to competing chip makers. The government says Qualcomm further impaired competition by using its dominant position to compel Apple to use its chips exclusively.Motions to dismiss such suits generally have slim chances of acceptance, legal experts said, because the judge is required to accept the plaintiff\u2019s factual allegations as true and the defendant must persuade the judge that a lawsuit presents no grounds to argue the case.\u201cWe respect the Court\u2019s decision, which is based on the legal standards that apply at this early stage of the case,\u201d said Qualcomm general counsel       Don Rosenberg       in a statement, adding that \u201cthe FTC will have the burden to prove its claims which we continue to believe are without merit.\u201dThe FTC\u2019s action faces an uncertain future despite the judge\u2019s ruling. The case was filed during the waning days of the Obama administration, and       Maureen Ohlhausen,        then the commission\u2019s lone Republican, dissented from the FTC\u2019s move to file the lawsuit.

The S&PCoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices, which cover the entire nation, rose 5.5% in the 12 months ended in April, after a revised 5.6% year-over-year increase in March.Prices in San Francisco increased 5% in April, making the Bay Area one of the slowest growing markets in the U.S. and well behind markets such as Atlanta, Boston, San Diego, Las Vegas and Phoenix.San Francisco\u2019s apartment market also is sluggish. Average rents decreased 0.3% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to data released this week by Reis Inc.Economists said the weakening is being caused by a confluence of factors: slowing job growth, less demand from new buyers put off by high prices and, on the rental side, an increase in new apartment supply as developers try to cash in on a multiyear boom.\u201cSupply gets the headlines,\u201d said       Conor Wagner,        an analyst at Green Street Advisors, a research firm. \u201cIf we had the same level of tech job growth and this (new) supply, there probably wouldn\u2019t be an issue.\u201dTechnology-sector employment is still expanding but at a much slower rate. Jobs in the technology, media and information sector were growing by about 15% two years ago but now there is roughly 1% growth, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors.That means fewer high-paid workers are able to snap up pricey homes and rentals.\u201cTech is growing more slowly than the rest of the economy and tech has been the thing that has been driving the economy forward the last decade,\u201d said       Ted Egan,        chief economist for the city of San Francisco. \u201cWe are in the middle of a notable slowdown.\u201dIn many ways San Francisco is a unique market. The average home price has more than doubled since 2009, according to Case-Shiller, making a slowdown virtually inevitable. The economy is overwhelmingly driven by the technology industry, unlike most other big cities.But there are parallels with the rest of the U.S.Economists, for instance, said the rate of price growth across the nation is unsustainable and a significant slowdown in home-price gains or even falling prices in some places is inevitable, especially if job growth slows.The number of home sales in the Bay Area in February sank to its lowest level since 2008, down 3.5% from a year ago and off 12.5% since 2015, according to PropertyRadar, a California real-estate research firm.\u201cYou\u2019re just seeing the grinding higher of prices weighing on sales,\u201d said       Madeline Schnapp,        Director of Economic Research for PropertyRadar.Nationally, home prices hit a fresh record in September and the pace of growth accelerated steadily through March. But in April, just seven of 20 cities reported greater year-over-year price increases than a month earlier.\u201cThe question is not if home prices can climb without any limit; they can\u2019t,\u201c said       David Blitzer,        managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \u201cRather, will home price gains gently slow or will they crash and take the economy down with them? For the moment, conditions appear favorable for avoiding a crash.\u201dThe price gains across the U.S. in recent years were driven by rising wages, a large demographic of people entering their 30s and looking to buy homes, and limited supply. Economists have said they are concerned that price growth that continues to outpace income growth isn\u2019t sustainable.Despite the slight slowing this month, prices are still growing much faster than incomes. But home-price growth remains less than half of what it was during the housing bubble in the mid-2000s. For much of 2005, for example, prices increased by more than 14% annually.Economists are concerned, however, about a handful of markets that have been seeing double digit or near-double digit growth. Seattle led the way in April with a 12.9% home-price increase and Portland reported a 9.3% year-over-year gain. Dallas, which recently replaced Denver in the top three, posted an 8.4% annual increase in home prices.After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.2% month-over-month, the 10-city measure also rose 0.2% and the 20-city index rose 0.3%. After seasonal adjustment, 13 of 20 cities saw prices rise in April.Sales of previously owned homes increased in May, in a sign that demand remains strong despite a shortage of homes for sale. Existing home sales rose 1.1% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.62 million, the National Association of Realtors said last week.Write to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 13:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/san-franciscos-housing-slowdown-could-spread-1498583304", "news_title": "San Francisco\u2019s Housing Slowdown Could Spread ", "keywords": " home price growth, hot housing markets, housing markets, slowing home prices,u.s. home prices, u.s. homes,corporate,industrial news,corporate social responsibility,economic performance,indicators,home sales,housing affordability,economic news,housing prices,real estate markets,political,general news,real estate,property,construction"}, {"content": "The apartment market delivered a mixed performance in the second quarter as rents increased along with the number of empty apartments.The national vacancy rate climbed to 4.4% for the quarter from 4.2% a year earlier, according to data released by Reis Inc.

At $2.7 billion, the fine amounts to about 3% of parent company             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s        GOOGL 0.59%       net cash\u2014or less than one month\u2019s operating cash flow. So affordability isn\u2019t the issue. The real question is how Google does business in a world where its massive scale conveys distinct advantages, along with some costs.The answer is that business will stay big and will go on, though perhaps a bit more slowly and carefully. Google is likely to appeal the EU\u2019s decision, so the ultimate changes resulting from the case still won\u2019t be apparent for a while. But something can be learned from past crackdowns on big U.S. tech companies.             Microsoft                   and             Intel Corp.       have been penalized by past EU rulings. But those penalties didn\u2019t cost nearly as much as some of their own bad business decisions\u2014specifically ones that caused them to miss the first wave of the smartphone revolution.Nor was the damage permanent. Microsoft\u2019s current market value of $540 billion is approaching the peak it enjoyed when it ruled the PC market in the late-90s. It is also double the company\u2019s value from when the EU handed down its first big fine in 2004. That is because Microsoft has been able to use the scale of its network to propel its business forward, even in a world where Windows doesn\u2019t power all the computing devices on that network. Google, for its part, enjoys the scale of a global network that powers a search business with no real challengers.And that is the reality for Big Tech. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and             Facebook                   are now of a size that will invite scrutiny by regulators. That scrutiny won\u2019t always be flattering, and will sometimes bear a cost.

As a result, its marketing costs as a percentage of revenue rose to 25% in the first quarter from 15% a year earlier, contributing to a $53 million loss compared with a small profit in last year\u2019s first quarter. Multiple potential investors in the IPO said they found the high marketing costs concerning.A Blue Apron spokeswoman declined to comment. The company said in securities filings that it expects marketing costs as a percentage of revenue to be lower in coming quarters as it is in the midst of implementing a new strategy to spend heavily.This predicament strikes at the heart of countless startups that sell products online, offer monthly subscription boxes or deliver just about anything at the tap of an app. Venture capitalists have collectively pumped billions of dollars into these startups over the past few years with the promise that exciting new brands and convenience would lure a new generation of millennial customers.Despite two decades of internet retailing, roughly 90% of U.S. shopping still takes place in brick-and-mortar stores, according to various estimates. And consumers are easily able to jump from one app to another, making it difficult for a company to spread into the mainstream.\u201cWith hyper adoption also comes hyper abandonment,\u201d said Brendan Witcher, an analyst at             Forrester Research Inc.       \u201cWhat the market needs to do with these startups is wait until the novelty effect has worn off\u2014that is really the key.\u201dFood delivery has been particularly tough. Well-funded startups that have shut down in this business include cooked meal-delivery companies such as Maple, SpoonRocket and Sprig Inc., which closed last month.Aside from Amazon and             eBay Inc.,       few e-commerce companies have become giant successes. Many venture capital and other investors have been burned as niche hits haven\u2019t translated to wide-scale adoption as expected.Companies including discount clothier Zulily Inc., high-end clothing site Gilt Groupe and home d\u00e9cor business One Kings Lane\u2014which together raised more than $700 million\u2014were sold at fractions of their peak valuation as buyers tired of their offerings.New York-based Blue Apron, meanwhile, is grappling with numerous meal-box imitators\u2014with two-word names like Purple Carrot, HelloFresh and Sun Basket\u2014that not only compete for customers, but also bid up advertising rates on             Facebook Inc.       and             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google.Blue Apron launched in 2012, after       Matthew Salzberg       left his investing job at venture-capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners and started the food company with two friends. Customers receive a box of food with just the right amount of ingredients, and can start or cancel the service weekly.Blue Apron quickly took hold among a variety of age groups and geographies\u2014not just urban millennials. By 2015, the company had raised nearly $200 million from marquee investors such as Bessemer and mutual-fund company Fidelity Investments and was valued at $2 billion despite having only 300,000 customers.Over time, Blue Apron has lowered the cost of buying and delivering food\u2014to 69% of the company\u2019s revenue in early 2017 from 93% in 2014\u2014in part by building warehouses and owning its own wine label and beef farm.But profits haven\u2019t followed as expected. When the company sought investors in 2015, it projected it would book $24 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in 2016 and $137 million in 2017, according to people who viewed the company\u2019s projections. Instead, the company reported a loss of $44 million on that basis last year and $46 million in this year\u2019s first quarter, even as revenue grew roughly as projected.To find more customers, Blue Apron has recently blanketed consumers with advertising and deals like $40 worth of discounts. In its IPO filing, Blue Apron says it has spent $94 to acquire each customer on average since 2014, although the fact that marketing spending is increasing significantly faster than customers shows that newer customers are proving far more expensive to find.Another problem is that Blue Apron appears to be churning through customers. The company doesn\u2019t disclose specifics, data in its securities filings about marketing spending and customer growth. But Daniel McCarthy, a professor of marketing at Emory University who has analyzed Blue Apron\u2019s numbers, estimated that at least 60% of customers stop using the service after six months.Blue Apron said in its IPO filing that its ability to retain customers presents a risk\u2014and that it would need to keep making new products to maintain their interest.\u201cThe retention at Blue Apron seems particularly troubling\u2014very much out of the norm,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said, adding a more reasonable drop rate would be 30% to 40% after six months. \u201cIt becomes hard to see how they\u2019re going to grow their way into profitability.\u201d\u2014Corrie Driebusch contributed to this article.Write to Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Blue Apron Spends to Tighten Customer Ties.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 12:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stir-fry-on-sale-blue-apron-turns-to-deals-to-draw-customers-1498561202", "news_title": "Stir Fry on Sale?

As the second anniversary of the so-called 709 Crackdown approaches, the unprecedented steps being taken by China\u2019s security apparatus to crush these activist-lawyers betray the deep anxiety beneath the Communist Party\u2019s self-confidence.The 709 Crackdown ushered in a humiliating parade of public confessions by lawyers including       Wang Yu,        Xie Xang and       Zhang Kai.       They are being forced to mouth wooden words far removed from the values they expressed in my research on China\u2019s defense lawyers.The Chinese authorities are taking advantage of extended disappearances, known euphemistically as \u201cdesignated residential surveillance,\u201d to apply an expanding repertoire of torture. This includes both psychological and physical pressure, some of it medieval in its primitive methods.In addition to life-threatening denials of medical treatment, lawyers are being forcibly injected with excruciatingly painful and disorienting drugs, presumably to force them to make false confessions. The most recent reports come from lawyer-brothers       Li Chunfu       and       Li Heping.Moreover, Chinese authorities often replace a persecuted lawyer\u2019s chosen counsel with a government-friendly substitute. Secret trials are held for those accused of betraying \u201cstate secrets.\u201d And lawyers whose representation would be considered standard in a society living under the rule of law are now accused of subverting state power. China is repudiating global standards for the practice of law and the protection of human rights.Why does China take such risks on the Party\u2019s domestic standing, its international reputation and its bid for soft power?China once encouraged its citizens to turn to the law. It raised legal consciousness and promised that the law would be a peaceful path to the redress of grievances. But as grievances began to accumulate for hundreds of millions of Chinese across China, the promise of peaceful resolution ultimately proved hollow.Pollution, property-takings, religious persecution, suppression of minorities, forced abortions, exploited labor, rampant corruption, unjust treatment by police, tainted food. China\u2019s leaders know there is a pot of discontent ready to boil over at any moment.Lawyers often have their hands on the lid because they are the persons of last resort when all other forms of redress have failed. But ever since       Xi Jinping       ascended to power, the law and its practitioners are no longer the channels for redress, or the restraint on the abuse of power, that they once were.What Beijing fears most are the ideals championed by these activist lawyers and the voice they can give to disempowered citizens. Activist lawyers fight for basic legal freedoms. They demand procedural protections for their clients, such as the freedom to choose or meet with a lawyer, the protection of clients from coerced confessions, and standards of fairness in court, including the examination and cross-examination of evidence. They want fair trials and neutral judges. As one lawyer said, \u201cI hate unfairness.\u201dThese lawyers seek an open political society where there is freedom of speech and association, including the ability of lawyers to form bar associations independent of state control. Many leading activists are Christians; they press for freedom of religion and protections for all believers, including the brutally repressed adherents of Falun Gong. They want open exchanges of views and beliefs, where citizens are freed from stifling censorship.Perhaps most dangerously for a one-party state, activist lawyers want political power to be divided. They insist that the executive be restrained by the other branches of government, especially the judiciary. They want political influence taken out of the courts, with many calling for the abolition of the Party\u2019s Political-Legal Committee, the ultimate decider in sensitive cases.In short, China fears freedom. Its leaders know that in many former dictatorships, including South Korea and Taiwan, lawyers led the march toward basic legal and political freedoms. China fears potential lawyer-leaders and the substantial proportion of its citizens who want those lawyers to be their spokespersons.China\u2019s leaders are gambling that its citizens don\u2019t long for freedoms, that they don\u2019t want open access to the wider world. They bet that China\u2019s pervasive and feared security apparatus can indefinitely subjugate and distract citizens and lawyers into quiescence.It\u2019s a gamble that may not pay off. Previous crackdowns hardened these lawyers\u2019 resolve and widened their appeal, especially to a younger generation of lawyers imbued with the ideals inscribed in international treaties.China\u2019s leaders are thus caught in a trap: The more harshly they treat the lawyers, the greater publicity these lawyers will generate from opinion-shaping international and social media, the closer the monitoring by international bar associations and rights organizations, the more vigorous the mobilization by the international civil society, and the more pressure placed on leaders of open political societies to take a moral stand.The China Dream is becoming a deepening China Nightmare. As a now-silenced Chinese legal academic recently said, \u201cto punish by way of trampling all over the law . . . is a process of sowing hatred. You get temporary peace, but sooner or later the volcano will erupt, the flood will drown all.\u201dMr. Halliday is co-director of the American Bar Foundation\u2019s Center on Law and Globalization and author of \u201cCriminal Defense in China: The Politics of Lawyers at Work\u201d (Cambridge, 2016).

But these cities, goaded by environmental groups, are emerging as the leaders of an antidiesel movement that is forcing Europe\u2019s car industry to rethink its future.Among the cities considering or seeking a ban on diesel vehicles or an environmental tax are             BMW AG\u2019s             hometown Munich, and Stuttgart, which hosts         Daimler AG       and         Porsche SE.       Their message to Europe\u2019s car makers: If you can\u2019t clean diesel, we will.\u201cCities are sending a signal to the public and manufacturers that there is a preference for clean vehicles,\u201d said       Ray Minjares,        a researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation. The group uncovered emissions cheating by German car maker Volkswagen AG that has drawn attention to the issue over the past two years.The scandal, which has since spread to other auto makers, started in the U.S. But less than 5% of U.S. cars are diesels, compared with half of all new European cars sold\u2014some 85 million on the road.The European Union took center stage after it set aggressive targets to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions to fight climate change.European auto makers, especially the Germans, bet big on diesel as their main tool to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. Diesel burns more efficiently than gasoline, so it gets better mileage and emits less carbon dioxide. The industry pushed it and won support from European governments, which have subsidized diesel through lower taxes since the 1990s.Climate change isn't the only issue. A study co-authored by Mr. Minjares concluded that just one pollutant from diesel engines caused 107,600 premature deaths world-wide in 2015. Around 80% of them were in Europe, China and India.But car makers will be hard-pressed to shift from diesel and still meet European greenhouse-gas targets. Demand for electric cars is still less than 2% of global auto sales. All sales of new electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, accounted for just 1% of the 14.6 million new cars sold in the EU last year.German car makers and unions are worried about the impact on their livelihoods. More than half the European sales of Germany\u2019s top brands, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz,         Audi               and Porsche, sport diesel engines.Dieter Zetsche, CEO of Daimler, which owns Mercedes, said this week that \u201cdriving bans are a political response, but will not lead to real change because they can\u2019t really be implemented.\u201dGermany\u2019s largest industrial union, IG Metall, also objects, in part because they say bans would disproportionately hurt poorer drivers. Car makers, it says, should make older engines cleaner while politicians should promote electric vehicles and invest in technology to improve traffic flows.\u201cSuch a sweeping demand is nonsense,\u201d Roman Zitzelsberger, head of IG Metall\u2019s southwestern Germany chapter, said this week.The German auto industry is offering a trade off: It has offered to update software on middle-age diesel vehicles on the road in Germany to bring them in line with modern emissions standards if bans are dropped. But nearly half of the 15 million diesel cars on the road in Germany are too old to fix.The mayors driving the movement say they have little choice. As traffic hubs, they suffer some of the world\u2019s most toxic air. And since the Volkswagen scandal discredited \u201cclean diesel,\u201d a barrage of court orders is forcing them to address the issue.In car-crazy Germany, where Rudolf Diesel invented the eponymous engine, Stuttgart will begin next year to ban all but the most modern diesels, around 90% of them. Munich, which is considering a similar step, must present a plan by week\u2019s end to drastically cut the city\u2019s chronic pollution, in response to a court ruling.Paris, which prohibits any diesel vehicle made before 1997 from driving in the city, will extend the ban in July to diesel vehicles made before 2001. That will affect nearly a fifth of the nation\u2019s heavy goods vehicles and a smaller percentage of passenger vehicles.London Mayor       Sadiq Khan       is creating an ultralow-emission zone with a system of prohibitive road tolls. \u201cThe air in London is lethal,\u201d Mr. Khan said in April as he unveiled plans to steeply raise the toll on the most polluting vehicles starting in 2019.Oslo, the Norwegian capital, enacted a diesel ban in January as winter smog smothered the city, fining violators nearly $180. The ban, in effect from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., was lifted once winds picked up and the air cleared.The strategy is gaining traction beyond Europe. Mexico City joined Paris, Athens, and Madrid at a mayors' conference in December in a pledge to ban all diesel vehicles from their cities by 2025. Seoul plans to ban diesel made before 2006 from driving in the city\u2019s central districts.\u201cIt is correct and important to discuss driving bans,\u201d       Dieter Reiter,        Lord Mayor of Munich, said this month.Write to William Boston at william.boston@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 12:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/european-cities-are-just-saying-no-to-scandal-tinged-diesel-vehicles-1498558921", "news_title": "European Cities Are Just Saying \u2018No\u2019 to Scandal-Tinged Diesel Vehicles", "keywords": "BMW,BMW.XE,Daimler,DAI.XE,Porsche Automobil Holding,PAH3.XE,corporate,industrial news,air pollution,political,general news,natural environment,air,water,land quality,motor vehicles,passenger cars,motor vehicle parts,automotive,vehicle engine,engine parts"}, {"content": "INDIANAPOLIS\u2014Charles Fox was walking between stacks of shipping containers this week in a storage yard near Interstate 465, when he spotted just what he hoped for\u2014a unicorn.Forty feet long and 9\u20196\u201d high, sandwiched between two rust-colored boxes of the same dimensions, was a container with a logo for Gateway Management Services, a fleet taken over more than 10 years ago by Textainer Group.And it was blue.\u201cNobody even knew these existed,\u201d said Mr. Fox, 31. He had seen Gateway containers in gray, never blue. He took carefully composed photos to submit to a website that serves as an unofficial encyclopedia of shipping containers.Containers may seem pretty uniform, riding trains and trucks or stacked near ports and warehouses.People like Mr. Fox know better. A small group of connoisseurs has taken up \u201ccontainer spotting,\u201d hanging around shipping yards to identify the globe-trotting metal boxes by color, size, vintage, origin country and other details.Rare finds are what \u201cmakes it all worth it,\u201d said Mr. Fox, an Indianapolis-based logistics-company salesman. \u201cBlue Gateway container!\u201dFinding an unusual box \u201cis analogous to the satisfaction that bird watchers get from spotting a very rare breed of bird,\u201d said Matt Hannes, who maintains the Intermodal Container Web Page, where he catalogs photos from container spotters around the world, including Mr. Fox.Rare containers are often a product of the continuing consolidation in the global shipping industry. Names and logos disappear off the boxes as companies get bought or go bankrupt, but a few oldies manage to sneak by. Savvy spotters may get excited by an old Polish Ocean Lines logo or a rust-colored container labeled UES.Other unusual containers include ones from the world\u2019s smallest shipping companies. Spotters also prize first sightings of new logos, such as the bright blue boxes of the newly formed China Cosco Shipping, or the alligator logos on MOL containers.For more-casual container watchers, there\u2019s \u201cThe Container Guide,\u201d a waterproof field guide that fits in the average pants pocket. Published by Craig Cannon and Tim Hwang, it tells the stories behind dozens of big shipping companies whose containers are commonly seen\u2014Maersk,             Hapag-Lloyd,Hanjin\u2014though it doesn\u2019t get into many rare containers.Modeled after the National Audubon Society\u2019s \u201cField Guide to North American Birds,\u201d the book\u2019s renderings show container logos and hues.Mr. Hwang said the book appeals to \u201ctwo types of infrastructure nerds.\u201d For some it is visceral\u2014they are awe-struck by the massive scale of seaports and container shipping. For others, it is scientific. \u201cThey get really into the data element of it\u2014mapping and tracking containers in and out of Oakland port terminals, for example.\u201dTo Joe Romano, the Container Guide is a way to make sense of the constant hum of activity at the Port of Tacoma, Wash., near his home. When he is out for a run or a bike ride and sees a container he isn\u2019t familiar with, he goes home and gets out the guide to look it up.\u201cI\u2019ve threatened friends with picnics on the waterfront where we take binoculars and spot containers,\u201d said Mr. Romano, a 36-year-old school librarian, adding that he is \u201csort of a lone wolf\u201d among his friends and family.He has been keeping his eyes out for a refrigerated Maersk box, which he has never seen. \u201cMaersk might not be the most boutique one to spot,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s my favorite as a layperson in the world of container spotting.\u201dFor many of the Container Guide\u2019s readers, the HBO detective series \u201cThe Wire\u201d raised the container\u2019s profile when the show\u2019s 2003 second season followed longshoremen. Containers, of both the 20-foot and 40-foot variety, have also become more visible in daily life as they are increasingly being repurposed in backyard storage, retail spaces and even housing.At Fast Lane Transportation\u2019s Southern California container-storage facility, President Patrick Wilson said he occasionally sees people taking photographs of his yard from the adjacent highway, which he has found odd.\u201cI never thought it might be somebody that\u2019s just an enthusiast,\u201d he said. Mr. Wilson conceded \u201cit\u2019s a little interesting\u201d when he sees markings on a container he\u2019s never spied before.Mr. Fox, on a spotting trip this week in what he called \u201cthe industrial armpit of Indianapolis,\u201d strolled through a yard of containers stacked up to four high. \u201cThey\u2019re so mesmerizing, so beautiful, so strange,\u201d he said, gazing up at a stack of forest green, teal, red, yellow and brown containers.His rare finds that day, other than the blue Gateway, were a brand-new blue Cosco 20-footer and a Seaco refrigerated box with an HNA logo.None of those matched his prize of a few years ago. \u201cThere was a Holy Grail for me,\u201d he said, a container with the letters \u201cCAST\u201d in a checkbook bank-routing-code font, from an old Canadian shipping company. One day, a container-yard gatekeeper he had befriended called, telling him there were some CAST boxes on the lot headed for the scrapyard.Mr. Fox rushed over to document them. \u201cThat was just the height for me. I mean, it was one of them.\u201dMr. Fox\u2019s wife, Kaylyn, said her husband\u2019s container spotting wasn\u2019t amusing on their honeymoon last year when the couple met up in Brussels with an avid enthusiast who runs a website where users can look up containers\u2019 alphanumeric codes.He drove the newlyweds to the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam, where Mr. Fox spent two 12-hour days photographing a variety of boxes: A beat-up MOL open-top, a Containerworld 20-footer he calls \u201can incredible unicorn,\u201d a CATU 20-footer that \u201chad eluded me for years.\u201d\u201cWe ate at many Belgian truck stops,\u201d Mrs. Fox recalls. \u201cI got a little tired of shipping-container talk.\u201dWrite to Erica E.

The idea is to motivate consumers to maintain continuous coverage, rather than jumping into the market when they get sick or need a medical procedure.The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said Monday that the legislation\u00a0\u201cincludes several urgently needed and important steps to help make the individual market for insurance more stable and affordable in 2018 and 2019,\u201d among them \u201cstrong incentives for people to stay covered continuously.\u201dBut insurers and experts also said it wasn\u2019t clear that the new six-month lockout period or other provisions would fully make up for the impact of another important part of the Senate bill: dumping the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that requires most people to have insurance.Many insurers feel that the ACA requirement, and the tax penalty associated with it, helps bring young, healthy enrollees into the market. Healthy enrollees help offset the costs of sicker consumers and hold down premiums.\u201cAny loosening up in the mandate is detrimental to the risk pool,\u201d said       Dave Dillon,        a vice president at Lewis & Ellis, an actuarial consulting firm, and fellow at the Society of Actuaries. \u201cI don\u2019t see that six-month waiting period as being very effective to encourage enrollment.\u201dPaul Markovich, the chief executive of Blue Shield of California, said the new continuous-coverage provision is \u201chelpful,\u201d but he would \u201clike to see more.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s as strong an incentive for individuals to stay in the pool\u201d as the individual mandate, he said.Overall, he said, the Senate legislation could help steady the marketplaces in the short term, partly by including two years of federal payments for cost-sharing subsidies and providing new federal stabilization funding that could help blunt costs for insurers. But \u201cwhen you get to the longer term, it will be much more challenging\u201d to keep the individual market steady.Martin Hickey, chief executive of New Mexico Health Connections, a nonprofit insurer, said that getting rid of the individual mandate would likely push his company\u2019s rate increase on marketplace plans for next year up by 10 to 20 percentage points, and he didn\u2019t expect that amount would be reduced by the inclusion of the six-month lockout requirement. In fact, he said, the continuous-coverage penalty might \u201cactually drive more sick people into the pool and lead to even greater rate increase.\u201dMaine Community Health Options, another insurer, has said its 19.6% requested premium increase for next year is linked closely to what it had already expected to be a lack of enforcement of the individual mandate.       Kevin Lewis,        chief executive, said it was too soon to tell whether the Senate bill\u2019s continuous-coverage rule, if it became law, would alter its rate proposal. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to determine to what extent it encourages participation,\u201d he said.The Congressional Budget Office, in its analysis of the Senate bill\u2019s effects, suggested that, largely due to the elimination of the individual mandate, premiums for individual plans would be 20% higher in 2018 than under the ACA, and 10% higher in 2019.After that, average premiums would be lower than under the ACA\u2014but a major driver of that drop-off would be the Senate bill\u2019s premium subsidies, which go toward far skinnier plans than the ACA\u2019s subsidies. Skimpier plans have lower premiums but higher out-of-pocket costs like deductibles.The CBO also projected that the lockout requirement would ultimately \u201cslightly increase the number of people with insurance,\u201d though the Senate bill as a whole would leave the individual insurance market smaller by around seven million people.Under both the ACA and the Senate bill, the CBO suggested, insurance markets would be stable in \u201cmost parts of the country.\u201dConsumer advocates and some insurance regulators have long raised concerns about the idea of tough continuous-coverage requirements, which they say can penalize people who are unable to afford insurance for a time after losing a job. But insurers have defended the idea, and a number of companies have argued that the ACA\u2019s relatively loose rules around so-called special-enrollment periods in the past have allowed consumers to buy plans when they needed medical care, then drop coverage once they didn\u2019t, knowing they could sign up again down the road.Still, federal regulators have moved to tighten those rules already, aiming to make it harder for people to get coverage outside the annual fall open enrollments.Jon\u00a0Kingsdale, a managing director with Wakely Consulting Group, said he didn\u2019t think the six-month lockout would have much more effect than the current open enrollment rules. \u201cIt should encourage a small increase in continuity of coverage,\u201d said Mr. Kingsdale, who said it was an improvement in the Senate bill. Still, \u201cI don\u2019t think this by itself will be nearly as effective as saying, \u2018you need to get coverage or you will owe us some money at tax time.\u2019\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-27 12:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-insurers-uneasy-with-senates-approach-to-continuous-coverage-1498580450", "news_title": "As Health Bill Proceeds, Insurers Regret Loss of Individual Mandate", "keywords": "affordable care act,health care overhaul,health exchanges,senate republicans,Blue Cross Blue Shield Association,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,health maintenance organizations,private health insurance"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Scotland\u2019s chief minister\u00a0reversed her earlier plans to push for a second independence referendum before Britain departs the European Union, saying instead she would revisit the issue once Brexit negotiations are completed, likely toward the end of next year.Tuesday\u2019s about-face came after the Scottish National Party, which went into the June 8 election with a pledge to hold a second vote on Scottish independence, saw an electoral setback and lost seats in the U.K. Parliament, mainly to the Scottish Conservative Party. SNP won 35 of the 59 Scottish seats in London\u2019s Parliament, down from the 56 seats it won in the previous election.Nicola Sturgeon,        leader of the SNP and head of Scotland\u2019s semiautonomous government in Edinburgh, originally said she wanted the fresh vote on independence to be held between the fall of 2018\u2014when the terms of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union are likely to be broadly agreed\u2014and before the spring of 2019 when the U.K. is expected to formally exit the EU.But U.K. Prime Minister       Theresa May       refused to enter negotiations on the subject, saying that Britain needed to focus on its negotiations with Brussels. U.K. government approval is needed in order for the referendum to be binding.Speaking to the Scottish parliament\u00a0Tuesday, Ms. Sturgeon said that while her party remained committed to holding another independence referendum, she wouldn\u2019t seek it \u201cimmediately.\u201d\u201cInstead, we will\u2014in good faith\u2014redouble our efforts and put our shoulder to the wheel in seeking to influence the Brexit talks in a way that protects Scotland\u2019s interests,\u201d she said, adding she would seek to keep the country in the European single market and strengthen the role of the devolved parliament.Ms. Sturgeon said she would lay out her views on the second referendum\u2019s timing once Brexit negotiations are concluded.\u00a0Her decision takes away any remaining doubts that the U.K. would be confronting its breakup even as it was negotiating its departure from the EU.The SNP\u2019s renewed push for Scottish independence was spurred by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union in the referendum last year.The vote revealed a rift between the countries that constitute the United Kingdom, with England and Wales voting to leave the bloc, and Scotland and Northern Ireland backing a continued membership.In the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, 55% voted against independence from the U.K. and 45% in favor.Write to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 12:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/scotland-delays-plan-for-second-independence-referendum-1498580163", "news_title": "Scotland Delays Plan for Second Independence Referendum ", "keywords": "brexit,brexit negotiations,independence referendum,scottish referendum,second independence referendum,snp,Scottish National Party,Nicola Sturgeon,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "Beer and Belgian waffles could be a delicious pair.

His latest cookbook includes a recipe for a michelada. \u201cIt\u2019s a Bloody Mary with beer,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, light and refreshing.\u201dMr. Husbands says his restaurant\u2019s beer sales at brunch are on the rise in part because customers appreciate beer\u2019s lower alcohol content compared with cocktails made with spirits. \u201cI\u2019m a 47-year-old man\u2014you give me two Bloody Marys and I\u2019m taking a nap,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can have a beer and still accomplish the honey-do list.\u201dLast Sunday at 10 a.m., Harpoon Brewery in Boston hosted 130 attendees at a brunch of eggs, homefries, huckleberry-candied bacon, pretzel bagels, fruit salad and its UFO Huckleberry beer. \u201cYou know it\u2019s the perfect brunch-time beer,\u201d the company says in its promotion for the $40 ticket.\u201cI don\u2019t think that enough brewers have paid attention to the fact that brunch is now a significant drinking occasion,\u201d says Harpoon CEO       Dan Kenary.       \u201cIt\u2019s become a ritual where people sit at a table for extended periods, and a flavored beer really complements those brunch foods.\u201dDogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton, Del., this year started offering brunch at its Rehoboth Beach pub every weekend after doing so occasionally for the last decade or so. Dogfish Head, long known for culinary-inspired beers, makes several breakfast-inspired versions, including its Beer for Breakfast stout, named after The Replacements song and brewed with maple syrup, roast coffee, and scrapple, a pork-and-spice mash. \u201cThat\u2019s the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance,\u201d says       Sam Calagione,        Dogfish Head\u2019s founder and chief executive.On Thursday, Snooze an A.M.

The shandy joins beer cocktails including brewmosas and micheladas on Snooze\u2019s extensive \u201cmorning cocktails\u201d list.Founders Brewery Co. in Grand Rapids, Mich., makes breakfast stouts including a Kentucky breakfast stout, called KBS, which is brewed with coffee and chocolates and then cave-aged in oak bourbon barrels for a year.

Brazil can\u2019t live with this anymore,\u201d said       Jos\u00e9 Guimar\u00e3es,        a congressman from the opposition Workers\u2019 Party. Former President       Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva,        also of the Workers\u2019 Party, said on his             Twitter                   account that Mr. Temer should call early elections and step down.In charges filed\u00a0against the president,\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Janot alleged Mr. Temer took about $150,000 in bribes from\u00a0the former chairman of\u00a0            JBS\u00a0SA,       the world\u2019s biggest meatpacker,\u00a0and agreed to accept about $11.5 million more.\u00a0Mr. Janot also requested permission from the Supreme Court to further investigate Mr. Temer for money laundering.\u201cThe spurious practices aimed at serving private interests with voluminous public resources aren\u2019t restricted to those reported in the charges hereby presented,\u201d Mr. Janot wrote in his indictment, saying Mr. Temer \u201cswindled\u201d Brazil\u2019s citizens. \u201cThe criminal organization didn\u2019t just operate in the recent past but remains in full activity today.\u201dA representative for Mr. Temer declined to comment. Mr. Temer\u00a0has previously denied any wrongdoing\u00a0and has said he wouldn\u2019t step down from the presidency.\u00a0On Tuesday, local daily Folha de S. Paulo reported that Mr. Temer and his aides were planning a counterstrike against Mr. Janot\u2019s allegations.Two-thirds of Congress must vote to allow the case against Mr. Temer to go to a trial, which would occur before\u00a0the country\u2019s Supreme Court\u00a0and result in a 180-day suspension of the leader\u2019s mandate.\u00a0That sets the stage for a high-stakes showdown between Brazil\u2019s crusading law-enforcement apparatus and an entrenched political class at a time of growing tension between the two sides.\u201cAt the end of the day, lawmakers will choose stability over sending a president to trial,\u201d predicted       Alfredo Kaefer,        a congressman from a small party aligned with Mr. Temer.Launched in 2014, the so-called Operation Car Wash has expanded from a narrow money-laundering probe into Brazil\u2019s most significant anticorruption push ever. In a country where the rich and powerful historically faced few consequences for wrongdoing, the investigation has led to the jailing of scores of high-profile businessmen and politicians, yielded more than $7 billion in settlements and stirred broad hopes for a fairer society.But it hasn\u2019t magically given Brazilians a new roster of honest politicians, something even the most optimistic political scientists say would take years. Instead, the investigations have fueled a state of nearly constant political turmoil, contributing to Brazil\u2019s deepest economic downturn in more than a century and leading to\u00a0the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff\u00a0in 2016.\u201cSo far, the confrontation of systemic corruption has basically been the work of law enforcement: police, prosecutors and judges, with strong support from civil society and public opinion,\u201d       Sergio Moro,        the judge spearheading Car Wash who is widely seen as a national hero, told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt needs to become part of the political agenda.\u201dBut with a second president in little more than a year teetering, some Brazilians are beginning to wonder if the costs of cleaning up corruption outweigh the benefits. Brazil\u2019s per capita economic output has contracted by some 11% since Car Wash began, forcing millions of layoffs.The instability has been compounded by growing evidence of corruption\u2019s omnipresence in Brazilian politics.In a videotaped testimony he gave as part of a plea deal earlier this year,       Marcelo Odebrecht,        the former chief executive of Latin America\u2019s largest construction company, said he was unaware of any politician managing to get elected without illegal cash. Undeclared contributions, he estimated, account for some three-fourths of all campaign money.\u201cEven if the guy says he didn\u2019t know, he still received money from his party that was [illegal],\u201d Mr. Odebrecht said.But with a budget deficit in excess of 9% of\u00a0gross domestic product, Brazil desperately needs to pass sweeping reforms to avert a potential debt crisis, economists say. Mr. Temer, who is deeply unpopular with ordinary Brazilians but enjoys cozy relations with much of Congress, was seen a capable negotiator until the latest scandal erupted.Growing numbers of politicians, and some members of the judiciary, have said Brazil should focus on fixing the economy under Mr. Temer, whose term ends in 2018. The president\u2019s governing coalition in Congress has remained largely intact even after the attorney general placed Mr. Temer under investigation in May.Brazil\u2019s electoral court, known as the TSE, this month acquitted Mr. Temeron charges of receiving illicit campaign funds in the 2014 election, a case that could have forced him from office. To reach its ruling, the court tossed out evidence from Car Wash showing that the campaign had taken clandestine money from Mr. Odebrecht\u2019s firm.\u201cYou can\u2019t replace a president every hour, even if you want to,\u201d TSE President       Gilmar Mendes       said as he cast the tiebreaking vote to absolve Mr. Temer.That decision was roundly criticized. \u201cTSE Ignores Proof,\u201d blared a headline in Rio\u2019s O Globo newspaper. Activists placed funeral wreaths outside the TSE\u2019s building in Bras\u00edlia.But tellingly, street protests on the scale of those that shook Brazil in 2013 and 2016 didn\u2019t materialize. Nor were there major demonstrations following\u00a0last month\u2019s release of a taped conversation\u00a0in which Mr. Batista told Mr. Temer of his efforts to obstruct investigations into JBS and its parent company.Prosecutors worry the public\u2019s apparent fatigue is giving politicians the cover they need to undermine Car Wash.\u201cWithout the support of the population, Car Wash wouldn\u2019t have happened, and without the support of the population it will die sooner than it should,\u201d said       Carlos Fernando dos Santos Lima,        a prosecutor on the original task force, in an interview.Mr. Lima, like many here, sees law enforcement as only part of the solution to Brazil\u2019s corruption problem. He says Congress should also seek to reduce the number of parties\u2014currently around 35\u2014to make politics less transactional. An electoral system that awards congressional seats to parties rather than individual candidates makes it possible for unpopular legislators to remain in office. Elected officials and cabinet members also enjoy special legal protections, such as a rule that they can only be tried in the Supreme Court for criminal offenses.Instead of making its members more accountable to voters, Congress is working on a bill that would expose law-enforcement officials to lawsuits for \u201cabuse of authority.\u201d Legislators have been talking openly of giving themselves amnesty for undeclared campaign cash. Mr. Temer\u2019s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, or PMDB, is working behind the scenes to influence the choice of a new attorney general to succeed Mr. Janot when his term ends in September, according to one of the party\u2019s senators.\u201cWe will vote the necessary reforms and purge the dictatorship of the prosecutors,\u201d said Darc\u00edsio Perondi, a PMDB congressman and staunch ally of the president. \u201cTemer is indispensable.\u201dThe stakes have risen since Mr. Batista\u2019s bombshell testimony shattered many politicians\u2019 complacent belief that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government was a \u201csacrificial lamb to prosecutors\u201d rather than a milestone in a probe seeking even deeper political change, said       Chris Garman,        a political analyst at Eurasia Group.\u201cThey are seeing investigations as reaching a politically dangerous tipping point,\u201d Mr. Garman said, noting that PMDB politicians have been openly trying to discredit Car Wash in recent weeks.Against that backdrop, some analysts say Mr. Janot is unlikely to secure the Supreme Court votes necessary to indict the president, who is cozy with much of the political class.But Mr. Temer\u2019s dismal popularity\u20147% of Brazilians approve of his government, according to a poll released Saturday by Datafolha\u2014sets limits on how far legislators are willing to stick their necks out for him.\u201cA lot of deputies are very nervous about their reelection possibilities,\u201d said       David Fleischer,        a political-science professor at the University of Bras\u00edlia.\u2014\u2014Luciana Magalhaes contributed to this article.Write to Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com and Paulo Trevisani at paulo.trevisani@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 11:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/charges-against-president-michel-temer-open-new-fight-in-brazil-1498578817", "news_title": "Charges Against President Michel Temer Open New Fight in Brazil ", "keywords": "brazil car wash,JBS S/A Ord,JBSS3.BR,BR:JBSS3,Michel Temer,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,assault,political,general news,crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,food,beverages,tobacco,animal slaughtering,processing,meat processing,consumer goods,food products"}, {"content": "On Monday night, everything about the star-filled NBA Awards at Manhattan\u2019s Basketball City was orchestrated and hyperbolic. And then an 83-year-old, white-haired, long-retired baller stole the spotlight with an unscripted one-liner.Boston Celtics\u2019 legend and five-time MVP Bill Russell has no verified social-media accounts, nor any known experience gallivanting through the City of Lights in houses of haute couture during Paris Fashion Week, as a handful of the league\u2019s top players did last week.Halfway through the night\u2019s slate of award presentations, Russell was honored onstage with the NBA Lifetime Achievement Award by a procession of giants who followed in his legendary sneakers: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,       Shaquille O\u2019Neal,        David Robinson, Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo. After climbing on stage with cane in hand, Russell pointed a slender finger at each of the five men beside him. He paused.\u201cI would kick your ass,\u201d he said with a wry smile.With that remark, Russell reminded the assembled crowd of the relative simplicity of the game as experienced by generations of previous players who would have found Monday night\u2019s ritzy gathering alien and scoffed at fan-voted awards like \u201cassist of the year.\u201dFor better and for worse, though, Monday night highlighted how Russell is the one out of step: The modern NBA player is fashion-conscious, brand-conscious and as comfortable on the red carpet as in a sweaty gym.From pre-recorded bits of the night\u2019s host, hip-hop star Drake, performing celebratory handshakes with Will Ferrell, to a rather arbitrary Nicki Minaj set in the middle of the event, much of the night felt removed from basketball.It often felt like a roast. Drake mocked players\u2019 antics on and off the court, the quartet of hosts from TNT\u2019s Inside the NBA jeered each other and even Coach of the Year winner Mike D\u2019Antoni of the Houston Rockets got in a jab of his own, saying \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be in New York thanking the sports writers.\u201dMost of the jokes on Monday night were met with awkward laughter rather than hysterics. Except Russell\u2019s, which was rewarded by the crowd for being both funny and almost surely heartfelt.Based on faces sitting round the carefully dressed tables at Basketball City, it was clear that many players in today\u2019s NBA struggled to take the affair too seriously. Many of the nominees\u2014like the Spurs\u2019 Kawhi Leonard, who was a finalist for both 2017 MVP and Defensive Player of the Year\u2014didn\u2019t bother to come. Of the players who were widely photographed in Paris through the weekend, the only ones to attend the show were Russell Westbrook, the 2017 MVP, and runner-up James Harden. Fittingly, Westbrook also picked up the fan-voted best style award.In an early bid for that award next year, Draymond Green of the NBA champion Golden State Warriors strutted the red carpet in black velvet loafers embroidered with a skull and crossbones, a turquoise blazer and black shorts.Once again, Russell was an exception: The cornerstone of the league\u2019s greatest dynasty took the stage in a simple dark blazer, a white shirt\u2014and pants.", "news_time": "2017-06-27 11:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-russell-stole-the-nbas-glitzy-awards-show-with-a-one-liner-1498577847", "news_title": "Bill Russell Stole the NBA\u2019s Glitzy Awards Show With a One-Liner", "keywords": "Boston Celtics,basketball,political,general news,fashion designer news,fashion,living,lifestyle,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "While the legalization of gay marriage eliminated many of the financial problems encountered by same-sex couples, legacy issues still present obstacles that financial advisers can help navigate.In particular, some same-sex couples may have to do more to prove their parentage. In other cases, financial-planning steps same-sex couples took before the Supreme Court ruled two years ago on the legality of gay marriage can cause complications if they were to divorce.\u201cSame-sex couples are coping with vestiges of inequality,\u201d says       Susan Sommer,        director of constitutional litigation at Lambda Legal, an advocacy group that focuses on civil rights for the gay community.But experts say there are some steps same-sex couples can take to head off potential problems.When a woman is married to another woman and one gives birth to a child, both spouses are legal parents to that child. The Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 marriage decision, Obergefell v. Hodges, addressed that issue, bringing greater security to children raised by same-sex parents, says Ms. Sommer.There are instances where one or both partners in a same-sex marriage might face challenges, however, and so same-sex couples with children should undertake second-parent adoption for added protections, Ms. Sommer says. (A second-parent adoption\u2014which can cost thousands of dollars and take several months to complete, depending on the state\u2014allows a same-sex parent to adopt a spouse\u2019s biological or adopted child, without the legal parent losing any rights.)Problems sometimes arise, for example, when only one parent is named on a birth certificate. If a parent\u2019s name isn\u2019t on the birth certificate, he or she may be unable to put a child on their health insurance or enroll the child in school. Indiana, for instance, won\u2019t put both married mothers\u2019 names on the child\u2019s birth certificate, Ms. Sommer says. And married dads\u2019 ability to put both their names on the birth certificate varies by state.The Indiana attorney general\u2019s office says Indiana statutes don\u2019t bestow parental rights based on the mere fact of a marital relationship. This is true for both opposite- and same-sex couples, according to Attorney General       Curtis Hill.Disputes about custody or child support are also cases where second-parent adoptions can head off trouble. And the process can make getting a child\u2019s Social Security benefits easier and faster should a parent die or become disabled.\u201cA second-parent adoption is the gold-standard for legally ensuring you will be recognized as a parent wherever you go in this country,\u201d Ms. Sommer says.Before gay marriage became legal, same-sex couples often registered domestic partnerships in their state to gain some of the rights of married couples.However, these agreements may now be a hindrance to married same-sex couples, says       Leighann Miko,        a financial planner and owner of Equalis Financial in Los Angeles.The biggest reason, she says: If a couple divorces but fails to terminate any existing registered domestic partnerships, they may still be together in the eyes of the law and tied to one another legally and financially.For instance, a former spouse may be liable for the other\u2019s current debt or, in the event of a death, the former spouse may be legally entitled to some or all of the estate, Ms. Miko says.While every couple should check with their lawyer, Ms. Miko generally recommends the couple terminate the domestic partnership to avoid any potential issues in the future. The cost and time it takes to dissolve such partnerships vary by state.Write to Veronica Dagher at veronica.dagher@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 11:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-advisers-can-help-same-sex-couples-navigate-legacy-issues-1498577723", "news_title": "How Advisers Can Help Same-Sex Couples Navigate Legacy Issues", "keywords": "same-sex marriage,political,general news,society,community,civil union,human rights,civil liberties,lgbt rights,social issues,marriage,divorce"}, {"content": "SEOUL\u2014North Korea\u2019s state media described President       Donald Trump\u2019s       \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy as \u201cNazism in the 21st century,\u201d and compared the U.S. president to Adolf Hitler, in the harshest language that Pyongyang has directed at the Trump administration.Mr. Trump\u2019s policy \u201cis the American version of Nazism far surpassing the fascism in the last century in its ferocious, brutal and chauvinistic nature,\u201d Pyongyang\u2019s state-controlled Korean Central News Agency said in a report published on Tuesday.The language reflects North Korea\u2019s hardening line on Mr. Trump, as the U.S. president turns up the heat on the regime nearly six months into his administration. While North Korean propaganda regularly targets the U.S. with military threats, it has remained quiet until recently on the president himself.Typically, North Korea has given new leaders in Washington and Seoul a wider berth at the beginning of their terms, as Pyongyang feels out their likely policies. Relations with the Obama administration soured in 2012 after a rapprochement between the two countries ended and North Korea ramped up its rhetoric against the president.Shortly after Mr. Trump took office in January, the U.S. government approved visa applications for Choe Son Hui, a top North Korean diplomat, to visit New York for back-channel talks, signaling a possible willingness to engage in dialogue. But the State Department eventually nixed the meeting following the killing of Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korean dictator       Kim Jong Un,        in Malaysia.Since then, the U.S. military has conducted several flyovers near the Korean Peninsula using B-1B bombers and directed a Navy aircraft carrier group to the region\u2014all to North Korea\u2019s consternation.In April, U.S. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       called for more diplomatic isolation of North Korea.\u201cThe world has never seen peace since the emergence of the American-first principle,\u201d the KCNA report said.The U.S. Embassy in Seoul declined to comment on the remarks.Mr. Trump said in a May interview with Bloomberg News that he would be honored to meet Kim Jong Un \u201cunder the right circumstances.\u201dRobert Carlin, a visiting scholar at Stanford University\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation, said the harsher rhetoric from Pyongyang, including recent articles in North Korea\u2019s party mouthpiece calling Mr. Trump a \u201creckless war maniac\u201d and a \u201clunatic,\u201d comes after several months in which North Korea refrained from making personal attacks on Mr. Trump.\u201cThe coarsening language toward the administration, and toward the president himself, seems to reflect a slowly sharpening discussion within the regime,\u201d Mr. Carlin, a former longtime Central Intelligence Agency analyst, wrote in an analysis for 38 North, a North Korea-focused blog.Pyongyang\u2019s remarks come ahead of a visit by South Korean President Moon Jae-in to the White House this week for talks on North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile program. They also come after       Otto Warmbier,        a U.S. college student, died after spending nearly a year and a half in detention in North Korea. His death, six days after being repatriated to the U.S., prompted outrage in Washington.In Tuesday\u2019s article, the North complained about sanctions on the country, which KCNA described as \u201can unethical and inhumane act, far exceeding the degree of Hitler\u2019s blockade of Leningrad.\u201dThe article also described Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate-change agreement as a violation of international norms that surpassed the horror of the Nazis\u2019 concentration camps. Mr. Trump has called his decision to withdraw from the pact a \u201creassertion of our sovereignty.\u201dSatellite imagery shows that North Korea operates a network of prison camps, which a United Nations report in 2014 compared with \u201cthe camps of totalitarian states of the twentieth century.\u201d North Korea denies their existence.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 11:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korea-compares-trump-to-hitler-1498541392", "news_title": "North Korea Compares Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler ", "keywords": " hitler, kcna, nazis,north korea,northkoreacarousel, north korea missiles, north korea nuclear, pyongyang, trump,Donald Trump,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "Mike Tyson,        51, is a former professional boxer who simultaneously held the WBC, WBA and IBF heavyweight titles.

He spoke with       Marc Myers.When I was 10, I was living on the streets of the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, N.Y. I was running wild, without adult supervision and getting into trouble. That\u2019s where I first heard MFSB\u2019s \u201cLove Is the Message.\u201dMy father had been a regular street guy who abandoned my mother and me when I was born. Alone, my mother couldn\u2019t control me.One day in 1976, I was at a party at a neighborhood center. A guy spinning records put on \u201cLove Is the Message.\u201d It had come out in 1973, but I hadn\u2019t heard it before. To extend the song, he used two copies of the record, switching back and forth when the other was ending.The instrumental grabbed me instantly. The song\u2019s intro was gentle, with electric bass and strings and then electric piano. The buildup was fantastic. Then the saxophone came in backed by a huge crew in the orchestra.After a long section with strings, the sax began to solo. I later learned it was       Zach Zachary.       He sounded like he was singing the song through his instrument. And the drums by       Earl Young       were crazy. He put down this skippy dance beat. I was a horrible dancer, but that beat moved me.Philly\u2019s MFSB (Mother, Father Sister, Brother), this big orchestra of studio musicians, also recorded a vocal version of the song with The Three Degrees, but the words didn\u2019t really mean anything to me: \u201cLove is, love is the message that I sing to you / Love is the message that I bring to you.\u201dThe instrumental was better. Eventually a friend recorded a cassette tape for me of the instrumental version playing over and over.

It also distributes weight more evenly to reduce pressure on the ball of your foot. Inside the sole is a thin medical-grade foam called P-cell\u2014used, among other things, to line prosthetics\u2014that molds to feet over time.The solid block heels are 60 millimeters (just over 2\u00bc-inches high). Dr. Parke settled on a sensibly chic mid-height based on aesthetics. Another aesthetic decision: the dainty width of the straps. They are, however, strategically placed to avoid friction with the ankle bone or anywhere else.One potential irritant: all those buckles that need to be fastened and unfastened. Adjustable straps help the shoe better fit women with high arches, Dr. Parke said, adding, \u201cZippers would detract from the delicacy.

It is being conducted by accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the Motion Picture Association of America, the industry group backed by Hollywood\u2019s six major studios, this person said.An MPAA spokesman in Singapore didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment. A spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Hong Kong declined to comment. The audit was first reported by Bloomberg News.The audit is scrutinizing ticket sales at a granular level, starting from how local movie theaters report sales all the way up to how revenue is reported to U.S. studios by state-backed China Film, which distributes most films in the country, the person said. China Film couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.Hollywood studios have long suspected that their box-office receipts in China are underreported. In some instances, Chinese theaters might sell tickets to a Hollywood film only to credit those sales to a Chinese film, the person said. Other Chinese theaters might simply not report the sales, the person added.The audit will likely be completed by the third quarter of this year\u2014ahead of a year-end deadline for the U.S. to renegotiate its film-trade deal with China. The studios are planning to ask for a bigger cut of the box office and an expanded number of slots for Hollywood films, the person said.The most recent trade deal, struck in 2012, allowed for 34 films to be released theatrically in China each year, with Hollywood studios receiving 25% of those box-office receipts.The 2012 agreement included provisions for a basic audit, which Hollywood had already wanted for some time, the person said. However, it took almost five years to hammer out a legal agreement for the audit, the person said.China\u2019s box office grew 3.7% to 45.71 billion yuan ($6.71 billion) in 2016. That was slower than an average growth rate of 34% over the past five years due to cutbacks in discounted tickets and a crackdown in so-called \u201cghost screenings,\u201d in which movie distributors buy tickets in bulk to make a flop look like a hit.Of the six major Hollywood studios,             Walt Disney Co.       fared the best in China in 2016. It was able to release eight films, including \u201cZootopia\u201d and \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d that collectively grossed almost $1 billion\u2014more than the other five studios combined. Sony Pictures Entertainment was the weakest performer among Hollywood\u2019s six major studios, with none of its releases\u2014such as \u201cThe Angry Birds Movie\u201d\u2014cracking the list of top 50 films in China last year.Corrections & Amplifications   An audit for the Motion Picture Association of America is reviewing box-office receipts for select Hollywood films released in China in 2016.

Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band\u201d turned 50 on June 1, many critics and music lovers praised it as a work that both helped to create the modern concept album and became the anthem for the Summer of Love generation. From the innovative cover design to the musical mashups that included a 40-piece orchestra and a \u201ckazoo\u201d made of toilet paper and a comb, \u201cSgt. Pepper\u201d seemed to be all about change and freedom.Yet I would argue the reverse: that the album has held up for half a century because it\u2019s so traditional.After all, what is a concept album but a late 20th-century version of the song cycle? Both are commonly defined as a collection of related songs that narrate an idea, theme or story. But the song cycle, which had a 19th-century overhaul by Beethoven, goes back thousands of years.The earliest known song cycle may be a collection of 42 sung Sumerian Temple Hymns, written around 2200-2300 B.C. by the Sumerian high priestess Enheduanna. (She may also be the first known author in history.)Over the next two millennia the genre expanded far beyond the confines of temples to become the popular folk music of its day. Around the eighth century B.C., Homer\u2019s \u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cOdyssey\u201d featured in part-spoken, part-sung performances aimed at a general audience. Indeed, many of the world\u2019s most famous epic poems, such as the great Hindu work \u201cMahabharata,\u201d a mythological and religious poem appearing in its present form around A.D. 400, and the Anglo-Saxon heroic chronicle of \u201cBeowulf,\u201d composed around 700-750, started as either wholly or partly musical \u201csaga-cycles.\u201dThen, for centuries, the song-cycle form languished while composers developed sophisticated individual songs and operas. Beethoven revived it, expanding the form to include a wider exploration of emotions and ideas. In 1816, a set of love poems by a young poet named Alois Isidor Jeitteles inspired Beethoven to compose \u201cAn die Ferne Geliebte\u201d (\u201cTo the Distant Beloved\u201d), six musically interconnected songs that evoke the pain of separation.Beethoven didn\u2019t compose any more song cycles, but the radicalism of his attempt made its mark on music.The genre developed further with       Franz Schubert.       His somber 24-song cycle \u201cWinterreise\u201d (\u201cWinter Journey,\u201d 1827) made the piano an equal partner for the first time, as it took up the task of evoking much of the natural landscape described in the text.       Robert Schumann\u2019s       1840 \u201cDichterliebe\u201d (\u201cThe Poet\u2019s Love\u201d), using careful key changes and more repeated musical material, introduced the central tenet behind the song cycle and the concept album: The whole work must cohere thematically and artistically.That rule guided the 20th-century transition of the song cycle to the concept album. But \u201cPepper\u201d wasn\u2019t the first: In America, folk singer       Woody Guthrie       used his Depression experiences in the 1940 \u201cDust Bowl Ballads\u201d\u2014with such songs as \u201cI Ain\u2019t Got No Home in This World Anymore\u201d\u2014while       Brian Wilson       piloted the Beach Boys to \u201cPet Sounds\u201d (1966), in which many critics saw the rise and fall of a love affair.Fifty years after \u201cSgt. Pepper,\u201d the internet has changed the music industry beyond all recognition. But, as the success of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 concept album \u201cLemonade\u201d demonstrates, the oldest of our musical forms is still the future.", "news_time": "2017-06-27 10:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-song-cycle-ancestors-of-sgt-pepper-1498575559", "news_title": "The Song-Cycle Ancestors of \u2018Sgt.

In \u201cThe Charade of the Paris Treaty\u201d (Review, June 17) Bjorn Lomborg succumbs to this myopic view when he states that President Trump \u201cfailed to acknowledge that global warming is real and wrongly claimed that China and India are the \u2018world\u2019s leading polluters.\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump is actually on to something if we were to broaden the definition of pollution, as we once did, to include polluting chemicals that contaminate water, air and the land, including habitats. Nations like China and India are among the most egregious polluters when this more liberal and comprehensive definition of pollution is applied.Thomas M. DoranPlymouth, Mich.The real problem with global accords on climate change isn\u2019t that they would make no meaningful difference but rather the lack of education for ourselves, others and future generations on the reality of climate change. The Paris treaty is the beginning of a modern global discussion on climate change, not the end. It sparked conversations at dinner tables about our individual environmental impacts as well as our collective global ambitions.The points brought to light by Mr. Lomborg aren\u2019t incorrect but should be reserved for the next level of climate-change discussion. While the science of the Paris treaty may not satisfy the most ardent environmentalists, the treaty itself was a strong step in the right direction by the leading global carbon producer. I believe the Paris treaty and other global accords provide the platform and inspiration for technological advancements to emerge and revolutionize our perspective on energy.Megan E. CopseyBaton Rouge, La.Mr. Lomborg correctly notes that the first round of pledges will fall far short of the stated goal of 2 degrees Celsius, and cites the failed Kyoto Protocol as evidence for Paris\u2019s likely failure, but he misconstrues the long-term logic of the agreement, as well as the way in which Paris is importantly different from Kyoto. First, every five years pledges are reviewed and ratcheted up, aiming to foster trust, cooperation and peer pressure between parties and gradually build toward more ambitious targets. Also, Kyoto had binding emissions cuts, whereas Paris has voluntary commitments to allow flexibility to account for countries\u2019 political and economic feasibility constraints.The global energy economy is an aircraft carrier, not a speedboat. The point of Paris is to create a sea change in how countries think about climate: to see it as deeply tied to their economic and geopolitical interests so that they begin to invest more in renewables and put a price on carbon. Mr. Lomborg ignores the geopolitical dimension of Paris. The Obama administration\u2019s most important strategic diplomatic achievement was to elevate climate to the same status as core issues in international cooperation, such as trade and security. In the new reality, if you\u2019re a bad actor on climate, countries can leverage this against you and make it harder for you to get what you want on a range of issues.David StoreyBrookline, Mass.", "news_time": "2017-06-27 10:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pollution-used-to-mean-more-than-just-co2-1498575504", "news_title": "Pollution Used to Mean More Than Just CO2", "keywords": "air pollution,political,general news,climate change,natural environment,global,world issues,air,water,land quality,letters,routine general news,chemicals,basic materials,resources"}, {"content": "Chris Jacobs\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Trump When ObamaCare Rates Jump\u201d (op-ed, June 16) criticizes the California Department of Insurance for authorizing health insurers to file two sets of rates this year and not last year, ignoring the instability in health-insurance markets caused by President Trump\u2019s actions undermining the Affordable Care Act. California isn\u2019t alone in this regard. Insurance departments across the nation didn\u2019t ask insurers to file higher rates last year.

Despite strong sentiment readings, growth in consumer spending and business investment has remained modest so far this year as the Trump administration and congressional Republicans discuss tax cuts and other legislative priorities.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen very much evidence that, thus far, expectations of policy changes have driven substantial changes in either consumer spending or investment spending,\u201d Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       said this month.

All kinds\u2014liquid and solid\u2014everything, except licorice. I thought licorice was disgusting and that it had nothing to do with the world of sugar.Sweets were so important that when I was 6 and at boarding school, I went so far as to chew gum that I found in a hedge.I grew up in Bangor, Northern Ireland, about a half-hour northeast of Belfast on the coast. My parents and my older brother, Mark, and I lived in a one-level bungalow. I loved it there. Those were golden days spent playing with friends, mucking about and picking berries.My mother, Dorothy, was everywhere\u2014cooking, cleaning and getting up in the middle of the night to make me a milky coffee. That was sweetened warm milk with a bit of instant coffee. My mum had been a nurse, so she was patient and loving.Around the time I was 5, our family went on a summer vacation to Gothenburg on the west coast of Sweden. My father, Harold, worked for             British Petroleum,       and a colleague of his had invited us.Soon after we returned home, we moved from Northern Ireland to Skewen, Wales. My father was transferred there. He was a self-trained accountant who, despite never having taken the accounting exam, had redesigned the way BP crunched its refinery numbers.One day in March 1968, Mark and I rushed into my mother\u2019s room to say goodbye before leaving for school. My mom was yellow and had been ill, but we gave her a kiss anyway before heading off. That was the last time we saw her. She died later that day. For us, childhood was over the moment we returned from school.Later, I learned that my mother had colon cancer and that my dad had asked to be transferred to Wales. Skewen was on a direct route from London, so mom\u2019s immediate relatives could drive up or take the train.Our two-story house in Wales was white. We didn\u2019t have a garage, which was disappointing. I had hoped for that American TV experience where you open the kitchen door and there\u2019s the car.But we did have an air-raid shelter in the back from World War II. It was down a few steps, and the space was damp and musty, like a sunken garage. Dad used it for storage.Wales was different from Northern Ireland. My brother and I had to be driven to school instead of walking, and we wore a uniform and cap, which was sort of fun.Mark and I shared a room and slept on bunk beds, with my brother on top. Which meant I controlled my own nightlight. My dad often read us books before bed, including C.S. Lewis\u2019s \u201cChronicles of Narnia\u201d adventure series.When I began boarding school in 1968 after my mother\u2019s death, the other boys left me alone because I would just argue with them. I was stubborn and scared, and trying not to show my fear. I wasn\u2019t one of the gang who used to pry the putty out of window frames, remove the glass and sneak into town to steal breakfast cereal. I never liked the herd mentality.I got my first laugh when I was 12. A teacher wrote a bunch of sketches, and I was asked to mime the behavior of a cricket player. I had all the mannerisms down. When I finished, the whole school audience laughed.After that experience, I realized I loved comedy and watched it all the time on TV. I even taped sketches with my recorder to listen back and develop my timing.When I graduated high school, I went off to the University of Sheffield in England to study math, accounting and financial management. I had a head for numbers.But during college, I realized that accounting was going to be too rigid. My mind couldn\u2019t sit still, so I dropped out. A friend, Rob Ballard, and I teamed up as street performers and made a go of it in London.\u2018I never liked the herd mentality.\u2019My first club appearance came in 1987, when I was 25, at the Banana Cabaret in South London. I got on stage and did five minutes on St. Paul writing a contemporary letter to the Corinthians. It went over well, and I began hammering my way up the comedy ladder.Today I live in London and Los Angeles. In London, I live in the central part of the city, near Victoria Station.My three-story house has a basement, which is my favorite space. It\u2019s a big open room with a large table in the center and a kitchen. It\u2019s a bit of a mess, but it\u2019s my mess. I don\u2019t keep sugary things in the house. I\u2019m running marathons now, so I avoid them.

Children and parents may turn imagined events into memories, misremember details or interpret shared events differently. And grown children often recall incidents parents have forgotten or blocked out.Taking time to compare memories and hash out the differences can help family members make peace with lingering issues that they never thought they could resolve.Mary Dell Harrington       has no recollection of walking down the driveway of her Larchmont, N.Y., home to meet her daughter\u2019s school bus one afternoon 12 years ago. Ms. Harrington had just gotten word that her beloved 80-year-old father had suffered a stroke in a distant state, and she was upset.Her 21-year-old daughter,       Annie Berning,        was 9 at the time. She recalls the moment clearly.\u201cI can see the outfit she was wearing,\u201d she says. It was a longish blue skirt and sunglasses that hid her mother\u2019s tears. Before Ms. Harrington could tell Annie the news, Annie asked her to drive her to the mall. When she learned a moment later that her grandfather had fallen ill, Ms. Berning felt sad and overwhelmed, she says. As the family cared for him and later prepared to attend his funeral, she began feeling guilty about asking for a trivial favor in the midst of a family crisis.Ms. Harrington was dismayed to learn her daughter still harbored some guilt when the topic came up recently. She reassured her that asking to go shopping hadn\u2019t been inappropriate or unkind. Ms. Berning says she found the conversation comforting.\u201cTalking about these stories gives you a chance to clear up tiny misconceptions, or tell your children it\u2019s OK,\u201d says Ms. Harrington, a writer and co-founder of Grown and Flown, a blog for parents of 15- to 25-year-olds.Recalling a memory isn\u2019t like replaying a mental video. More often, memories are reconstructions of facts, inferences and imagined details that people patch together after the fact, helping them build a sense of identity. Parents and children alike may forget difficult moments they don\u2019t want to recall.Children and teens are most likely to remember events that are both emotional and relevant to the developmental stage they\u2019re in at the time, a 2016 study shows.Playing sports was important to Annie\u2019s brother       Walker Berning       as a teenager. He was a football, baseball and hockey player and also ran track. His most vivid memories from that time are of injuries that sidelined him, including a clipped Achilles tendon in a schoolyard accident that kept him off the baseball diamond for a while. Now 26, Mr. Berning is a Washington, D.C., financial analyst.Twins and siblings who are close in age sometimes claim memories that actually happened to the other sibling, such as winning a swim competition, a 2001 study says.Children perceive the passage of time differently than adults, says       Robyn Fivush,        a psychology professor at Emory University. Adults can track time on a phone or calendar, but a few days can feel like weeks to a child, causing him to remember events as lasting longer than they actually did.That generation gap has become a running joke in the Wingens family.       Helene Wingens\u2019s       two older sons, Andrew, 25, and Jonathan, 20, vividly recall a baby nurse staying with the family for several weeks after their younger brother David was born 16 years ago. Every time it comes up, Ms. Wingens wonders what they\u2019re talking about. Ms. Wingens, a Livingston, N.J., writer, insists the nurse stayed only for a weekend.Andrew and Jonathan remember the nurse watching \u201cCatDog\u201d cartoons on the family TV, and insist they wouldn\u2019t have such vivid memories after only a weekend. Whatever the case, the baby-nurse dispute has become a fixture in family lore. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever settle it,\u201d Jonathan says.Setting the record straight can be worth the effort. Children\u2019s memories sometimes reflect harmful distortions, such as a child blaming himself for his parents\u2019 divorce, says       Kate McLean,        author of \u201cThe Co-Authored Self,\u201d a book on how individuals build a sense of identity through shared stories. It\u2019s best in such cases to explain the real reasons in an age-appropriate way, to relieve him of that burden.In other cases, it\u2019s better for children to be allowed to stick to their own version of events. Families sometimes tell and retell stories that cast a child in the same role over and over, as a screw-up or a maverick, without regard for the fact that she has changed and moved on, Dr. McLean says. This can feel confining to teens or young adults.Parents might dwell on stories about how sensitive a teen was as a child and how she cried a lot, while the teen may be trying to cobble together a more mature self-image, insisting, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not sensitive at all. I\u2019m strong!\u201d says Dr. McLean, a psychology professor at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Wash.As she presses family members to revise their view, Dr. McLean says, the teen learns to stand up for herself.Q: Enjoyed your recent column on visual distractions at the office. I\u2019ve been wearing noise-cancelling headphones to block out my co-workers\u2019 loud voices, but they\u2019re not working. Any advice?\u2014D.Z.A: Noise-cancelling headphones block continuous sounds such as an airplane engine, but don\u2019t work well in screening out co-workers\u2019 conversations. Many people find listening to background-noise apps with headphones or earbuds works better. These apps include variations on white noise, which is consistent in intensity across all frequencies and has a tinny sound. Pink noise plays lower frequencies at greater intensity, like the low rumble of rain or wind through trees. Brown noise is the deepest of the three and resembles the roar of a waterfall.Among the best apps is myNoise.net, with dozens of tracks from ocean waves to the running water and birdsong of a Japanese garden. Noisli allows users to create their own blend of sounds from a menu ranging from coffee-shop chatter to a meadow at night. Another is Coffitivity, offering tracks that evoke the ambience of various kinds of cafes. Also worth considering is Naturespace, with a big catalog of high-quality nature tracks.Write to Sue Shellenbarger at Sue.Shellenbarger@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-27 10:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-family-memory-you-think-you-have-1498574819", "news_title": "The Family Memory You Think You Have", "keywords": "children,disputed memories,false memories,family life,grown and flown,memories,more on parenting,parenting,parents,teens,work-life balance,political,general news,general labor issues,living,lifestyle,relationships"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Supreme Court\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0agreed to consider New Jersey\u2019s bid to legalize wagering on sports, a case in which the state is challenging restrictions imposed by the federal government.The justices, in a brief order, said they would hear an appeal by New Jersey\u2019s Republican Gov.

FRO 1.75%      , was overtaken by rivals, said Mr. Fredriksen in a rare interview earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m looking to invest more than two billion [dollars] in acquisitions,\u201d he said, noting he is primarily looking to acquire companies outright rather than buying tankers from rivals.An oversupply of cheap oil and too many tankers chasing too little cargo has respectively hit drilling and shipping hard. Mr. Fredriksen reckons shipping companies will scrap three times as many tankers this year than they did last year, with fewer new vessels coming to market.\u201cAround 150 very large crude carriers, or about 20% of the existing fleet, will be scrapped over the next couple of years,\u201d said the 73-year-old, known in the industry as \u201cBig John.\u201d \u201cTo have a say in the market you have to have size, so I\u2019m looking to buy tankers all the time.\u201dThe price of a five-year-old VLCC has fallen 17% to around $58 million over the past year. Amid this drop, Frontline pressed a $765 million, hostile takeover for Norway\u2019s             DHT Holdings Inc.       earlier this year.\u2018The tanker market is depressed, so his quest to make Frontline even bigger seems odd. But it will eventually recover and Fredriksen is renowned for his sense of timing.\u2019DHT fought off that effort, prompting Mr. Fredriksen to drop his bid and turn his sights on U.S.-listed listed Gener8 Maritime Inc., a deal that would have created the world\u2019s largest tanker fleet if sealed. But the talks with Gener8 fell apart over price, according to a person familiar with the matter.Frontline CEO       Robert Hvide Macleod       Monday said the company is still on the hunt, but isn\u2019t currently involved in any takeover activity. \u201cWe believe the market will offer good opportunities in the future, and our strategy is to continue expanding the fleet,\u201d Mr. Macleod said.Despite some consolidation among container liners, shipping remains a highly fragmented industry, marred by overcapacity and lengthy price wars. Dozens of companies that ship containers, oil and commodities like iron ore and grain have declared bankruptcy over the past three years. Others have fallen deeply into the red as freight rates lurk well below break-even levels.\u201cThe tanker market is depressed, so his quest to make Frontline even bigger seems odd,\u201d said       Mike Sapountzoglou,        a director at Athens-based ship management and financing company Flagship Navigation Ltd. \u201cBut it will eventually recover and Fredriksen is renowned for his sense of timing.\u201dMr. Fredriksen said U.S. hedge funds and Chinese state-owned shipping companies were responsible for the cratering of the global shipping market over the past few years. Industry executives say around $30 billion was put into shipping from 2009 to 2015 by U.S. investors, exacerbating a capacity glut.The son of a Norwegian shipyard welder, Mr. Fredriksen dropped out of high school and moved to Beirut to trade oil. He later supplied fuel to the U.S. Air Force during the war in Vietnam. His tankers moved crude out of Iran during that nation\u2019s war with Iraq in the 1980s.He gave up his Norwegian citizenship in 1996 and became citizen of Cyprus. He also has offices in Singapore and Bermuda, where taxes are substantially lower than in his native Norway.Mr. Fredriksen has said his empire would be passed to his twin daughters, Kathrine and Cecilie, who are increasingly taking responsibilities in the group.Apart from Frontline, Mr. Fredriksen also controls dry-bulk shipping company Golden Ocean Group, vessel-leasing firm             Ship Finance International Ltd      , Seadrill and the world\u2019s biggest Atlantic salmon producer,             Marine Harvest AS      A. He is worth more than $9 billion according to Forbes.Mr. Fredriksen owns 24% of Seadrill Management Ltd and serves as the company\u2019s chairman. Seadrill, which operates 49 oil rigs and has an additional 13 under construction, faces a July 31 deadline to restructure some $10 billion of debt.Demand for the company\u2019s rigs, which formerly commanded daily leases of up to $800,000, dropped to around $200,000 as cheap oil from U.S. shale drilling flooded the market. In May the company said it had made significant progress with its banks on the terms of a restructuring plan that would likely require filing for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. or U.K.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to answer if it will come out of restructuring, but as long as I back it, we\u2019ll be OK,\u201d said Mr. Fredriksen, declining to elaborate. \u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve dealt with messier situations than Seadrill, but we came through.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   Seadrill Management Ltd., of which shipping magnate John Fredriksen holds 24%, faces a July 31 deadline to restructure some $10 billion of debt.

Bush,        said: \u201cI think they\u2019re learning they have to do a better job of it. I don\u2019t fault them for the way they\u2019ve had to learn this process. But I\u2019m hoping they do not get distracted. That\u2019s the most critical thing.\u201dKellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, said, \u201cIt\u2019s business as usual here in the White House, where the president\u2019s packed schedule and the breakneck pace have been unchanged.\u201dPast administrations have taken different approaches in parrying investigations, which can be a consuming preoccupation for the officials involved.Former President       Bill Clinton       tapped White House attorney       Lanny Davis       to manage press inquiries into various ethics investigations that played out in part of his second term, hoping to create a firewall between the probes and his policy agenda.Faced with a special counsel investigating the outing of Central Intelligence Agency covert agent       Valerie Plame,        some of Mr. Bush\u2019s White House aides hired their own attorneys.As of now, the Trump White House has settled on a model that relies heavily on the president\u2019s chief outside lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, and a team that includes longtime Republican communications specialist Mark Corallo and another outside attorney who is a practiced TV commentator, Jay Sekulow, to defend the president.Robert Mueller,        a special counsel hired by the Justice Department, is conducting the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe of Russia activities in the 2016 election and whether the president obstructed justice by trying to curtail or influence the probe, according to people familiar with the investigation. Mr. Mueller took over after Mr. Trump fired former FBI director       James Comey,        who initiated the investigation last year.Senate and House committees are also examining what happened during the campaign and whether any Trump advisers colluded with Russians. The White House has denied any wrongdoing by the president and his team.One advocate for the approach taking shape in the administration is senior White House adviser       Steve Bannon.       He aims to keep the response to the investigation \u201coutside the White House\u201d so that it doesn\u2019t become an \u201call-consuming thing\u201d inside the building, a person familiar with the matter said.Also important to Mr. Bannon was finding a \u201cLanny Davis\u201d type, this person said. That role seems to have fallen to Mr. Sekulow.White House chief of staff Reince Priebus is himself a lawyer and hasn\u2019t retained counsel, nor has Ms. Conway, who served as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager. Mr. Bannon hasn\u2019t hired a lawyer either and doesn\u2019t plan to do so, the person familiar with the matter said.Mr. Kushner\u2019s attorney is Jamie Gorelick, a former Clinton administration official. She is a partner at WilmerHale, the same law firm that employed Mr. Mueller until he became special counsel.After Mr. Mueller left WilmerHale, Ms. Gorelick asked Mr. Kushner to obtain independent legal advice on whether he should keep her on, given the WilmerHale connection.Mr. Kushner sought advice from       Abbe Lowell,        a seasoned lawyer who was counsel to House Democrats during the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton. Ms. Gorelick said in a statement Monday that Mr. Kushner has added Mr. Lowell to his legal team. He is also keeping Ms. Gorelick.Mr. Trump receives regular briefings from the Kasowitz team, speaking to them virtually every day, a White House official and a person close to the team said. Mr. Kasowitz has also met with White House aides. In one meeting, Mr. Kasowitz told the aides that they could come to him in the event they had questions, three people who were in the meeting said.A person close to the Trump legal team said that Mr. Kasowitz isn\u2019t dispensing legal advice to White House staff. Asked about Mr. Kasowitz\u2019s meeting with White House aides, this person said that Mr. Kasowitz offered to recommend attorneys if people felt they wanted legal counsel, this person said.Mr. Kasowitz declined to comment.Former White House lawyers said it is important for staff members to retain their own counsel to look out for their interests and not to rely on Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team.\u201cWhen you\u2019re at risk like this you need to make sure you\u2019ve got someone who\u2019s in your corner and looking out for your interests only,\u201d said       Jane Sherburne,        who led the White House legal team handling ethics issues in Mr. Clinton\u2019s first term.\u2014Michael C.

It also cut its benchmark interest rate to a new low of 0.25% and embarked on a fresh round of bond purchases to support growth in response to the acute uncertainty generated by the Brexit vote.The instruction to banks to begin returning capital to pre-referendum levels comes alongside an intensifying debate among BOE officials over whether to begin nudging up their benchmark interest rate.Chief Economist       Andy Haldane       last week signaled that he is inching closer to voting for a gentle increase in borrowing costs to restrain quickening inflation, adding an influential voice to an increasingly vocal minority in favor of withdrawing some of the extensive central-bank stimulus underpinning the U.K. economy.The Federal Reserve this month said it would raise short-term interest rates for the fourth time since December 2015 and mapped out a plan to begin shrinking its vast portfolio of assets, highlighting officials\u2019 confidence in the U.S. economic expansion. In Europe, the European Central Bank is starting to consider the circumstances under which it, too, would begin reducing monetary stimulus, for the 19-nation eurozone.In announcing its decision on bank capital requirements Tuesday, the BOE said in its latest assessment of the prospects for financial stability in the U.K. that the broad level of risk appears \u201cstandard\u201d rather than elevated, justifying a reversal of July\u2019s decision.The central bank raised banks\u2019 countercyclical capital buffer to 0.5% from its current level of zero and said it expects to raise it again, to 1%, in November. The buffer is designed to be raised in good times to build resilience against potential future losses and relaxed in a downturn, to keep the economy flush with credit.\u201cThis action will supplement banks\u2019 already substantial ability to absorb losses,\u201d the BOE said.Officials warned, though, that \u201cpockets of risk\u201d warrant extra vigilance from banks and regulators.Those concerns include prospects for Brexit talks ending without an agreement on future economic ties to the European Union; a rapid rise in consumer borrowing in Britain; and heavy indebtedness in China.At a news conference, Gov.       Mark Carney       said the BOE is aiming to strengthen the banking system so that it can withstand any shocks if these or any other threats fully materialize.British households\u2019 unsecured borrowing has been growing at an annual rate in excess of 10% for several months, as consumers try to support spending amid meager wage growth and quickening inflation. The BOE said banks must test borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans more stringently and ensure they can comfortably cover defaults.On Brexit, the BOE said it is overseeing banks\u2019 contingency planning for withdrawal and listed ways in which a disorderly British exit from the bloc could hurt the U.K. and European economies.Mr. Carney said that while a \u201cno deal\u201d scenario between the U.K. and the EU might not be the most likely outcome, it would be the most threatening to the financial system and wider economy. The U.K. must conclude exit talks by March 2019 unless EU member states agree to an extension.\u201cWe start from the most difficult situation from a financial stability perspective,\u201d Mr. Carney said.Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 10:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-england-orders-banks-to-boost-capital-1498557340", "news_title": "Bank of England Orders Banks to Boost Capital ", "keywords": "brexit,capital buffers,consumer credit,monetary policy,Bank of England,European Union,interest rates,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,banking,central banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "It\u2019s telling that just when Micron is back to making serious money, the first question is: how long can that last?The maker of DRAM and NAND Flash memory chips reported just over $1 billion in operating income in its last quarterly report and is expected to report another $1.9 billion on Thursday afternoon for the period ended in May. That puts             Micron Technology Inc.        MU -0.25%       on track to post more than $5 billion in operating earnings for the fiscal year ending in August, which would be a company record.Micron barely broke even on an operating basis in the last fiscal year, so its newfound fortune is particularly impressive. And investors have learned to be cautious, given the highly cyclical nature of the memory chip business. Micron has lost money in five of the last 10 fiscal years. The stock also lost about a third of its value in 2015 following a sustained decline in memory prices.Micron\u2019s stock has since gained back most of that ground. And there is more room to run. While spot prices for DRAM have been flat to slightly down over the last few months, they are nearly twice their level from a year ago but still well off their peak over the last five years, according to DRAMeXchange. Prices for NAND Flash are also still well below their peak. And pricing can still improve from new demand being generated by growth markets such as data centers and cars as well as this year\u2019s smartphone cycle -- which will include a 10th-anniversary edition of the iPhone.The big question is whether supply will stay rational. The future ownership of             Toshiba\u2019s       NAND production business is still unclear. And several Chinese companies are building new memory chip production facilities there to advance that country\u2019s technology industry. Some of those are expected to come online next year. Harlan Sur of             J.P. Morgan                   predicts \u201cseveral years\u201d until those companies catch up and field competitive products, in part given their lack of intellectual property. Still, it\u2019s a dynamic investors should watch closely.Micron, in the meantime, benefits from an improving cost structure that has lifted gross margins to their highest in more than a decade. And its rapidly expanding bottom line has made the stock cheap at just 5.5 times forward earnings, despite its recent gains.

Hire nerds.Companies with a higher proportion of scientists and engineers are more productive than their peers, even when those workers aren\u2019t directly involved in the research-and-development tasks that drive the most obvious forms of innovation, a new paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests.The authors studied manufacturing plants and found that, for example, a plant with 10 scientists and engineers among its 100-person workforce would be 4.4% more productive than a plant with the same number of employees but no scientists and engineers. The researchers used a measure of productivity that captures improvements from firms investing in new technology or hiring better-educated workers.Some 80% of industrial scientists and engineers work in roles outside of formal R&D, such as information technology and operations.

Most previous research has focused on jobs where scientists and engineers were inventing new products.Analyzing employee and production data from manufacturing establishments between 1992 and 2007, the authors found that the value scientists and engineers bring even to non-R&D roles derives from their training, says Mr. Freeman.When a manufacturer needs to fix the airflow in its factories, for example, \u201cyou need someone who knows about the flow of air currents, the right equations to use and other well-established principles,\u201d he says.Write to Lauren Weber at lauren.weber@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Scientists Are Useful Beyond R&D Work.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 10:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-a-more-productive-workforce-scientific-know-how-helps-1498572000", "news_title": "For a More Productive Workforce, Scientific Know-How Helps", "keywords": "engineers,improve productivity,improving workflows,management,management style,productivity,scientists,Andrew Wang,Erling Barth,James Davis,Richard Freeman,research,development,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,industrial production,employment costs,economic news,political,general news,career planning,general labor issues,sciences,humanities,accounting,technical services,human resources consulting,consulting,business,consumer services,business consultancy,engineering services"}, {"content": "A Lake Tahoe waterfront estate that once belonged to casino mogul       Steve Wynn       has sold for $31.1 million.The sales price is a record for the tony enclave of Incline Village, Nev., said listing agent Patricia Lantz of Lakeshore Realty.On 4.972 acres, the Incline Village home includes 210 feet of lake frontage and a private beach with a pier and boat hoist. The 12,661-square-foot main house has four bedrooms, a theater, a gym and a four-car garage. The guest house includes three bedrooms.The buyers are       Nora Betyousef Lacey       and her husband Michael Lacey, a pathologist. \u201cIt\u2019s a very elegant place to be on the lake,\u201d said Ms. Lacey, founder of bio-tech company Cell Marque, which produces cancer detection products and which she sold\u200bto Sigma-Aldrich for $170 million in 2014, she said.Ms. Lacey said she plans to make only a few changes. \u201cWe want to keep the legacy of the Wynns,\u201d she said.

Ms. Lacey said she dedicates her time to her foundation which supports Assyrian entrepreneurs and charities such as the Assyrian Arts Institute, which she founded to support Assyrian artists.The property was first put on the market in 2016 with an asking price of $45 million.

He cautions management prospects that banks may close their accounts or reject mortgage applications because marijuana violates U.S. law.\u201cThe people you end up with as executives are people truly willing to take a risk,\u201d Mr. Peterson observes.Mike James       says he worried about the possibility of harming his career before he left his top management role at a nutritional-supplements firm to join Terra Tech\u2019s predecessor in 2010. So, he kept working for his old employer during four years as the part-time chief financial officer of his new employer.Thirty states and Washington, D.C., have legalized marijuana for at least medicinal use, but the U.S. government still considers it an illegal and dangerous drug. U.S. sales of legal marijuana should reach $19 billion by 2021, up from $5.9 billion last year, predicts Arcview Group, a marijuana investment and research firm.Many executives with Wall Street backgrounds move into the marijuana business \u201cbecause they can see the growth trajectory,\u201d says Troy Dayton, Arcview\u2019s CEO.Mr. James, now Terra Tech\u2019s full-time CFO, thinks most conventional companies would employ him in the future. But \u201cI will not be applying for a job at Target,\u201d he vows.During their next job search, executives of an offbeat company should tout their transferable skills such as a record of innovation, career advisers suggest. \u201cIt is absolutely about the leader\u2019s personal brand, not the industry\u2019s brand,\u201d says       Elaine Varelas,        managing partner at Keystone Partners, a career transition and leadership-development firm.This approach succeeded several years ago when a female executive left Playboy Enterprises Inc., famous for nude photos. She says she emphasized her team-building skills at the well-known entertainment business. \u201cFind that positive spin,\u201d she recommends.The executive soon got hired by a professional-services firm. \u201cThey thought it was really cool that I had worked for Playboy,\u201d she recalls.Chris Postler       also hesitated to join an edgy business. Nearly four years ago, Pure Romance LLC wooed the bank financial analyst for a middle-management position. The Cincinnati firm uses a predominantly female independent sales force to sell \u201crelationship enhancement products\u201d for women.In Mr. Postler\u2019s Catholic family, such wares \u201chad been taboo for a long time,\u201d he says. He turned down Pure Romance\u2019s offer four times.Mr. Postler changed his mind after Chief Executive       Chris Cicchinelli       promised that he might become second-in-command someday. Mr. Cicchinelli says he believed at the time that Mr. Postler \u201ccould help us set strategy and execute.\u201dRecruited by Pure Romance in 2014, Mr. Postler landed his first executive post the following year. But he didn\u2019t lose his unease about its products \u201cuntil way into my employment,\u201d he says. He was named chief operating officer in January.Pure Romance has grown so fast\u2014with 2016 sales climbing 24% to $203 million\u2014that mainstream businesses now court Mr. Postler for senior operational spots. \u201cBecause their growth stagnated, they are looking for that growth magic from a new executive,\u201d he says.\u00a0 He has no plans to quit Pure Romance.At Ivy International SA, a matchmaking concern, men\u2019s fears about career damage have crimped its efforts to recruit one for the management team. Ivy clients pay as much as \u20ac250,000 ($279,825) for its personalized dating services.Many male applicants consider Ivy a frivolous business whose stigma would discourage conventional future employers from taking them seriously, says       Inga Verbeeck,        CEO of the Belgium-based firm, which she founded in 2012.

For an economy so dependent on consumers, the move shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly.The central bank made two moves Tuesday. It increased general capital requirements, reversing its move in the wake of last summer\u2019s Brexit vote to withdraw the so-called countercyclical buffer. And it will now stress test consumer credit exposures this summer to determine whether banks need to build in greater resilience to losses against the risk of an economic downturn.In recent months, U.K. consumer credit, which includes credit cards and unsecured loans, has been growing at an annualized rate of more than 10%, over five times the rate of incomes. This has helped keep the U.K. economy buoyant, but leaves banks exposed to big potential losses. Consumer lending is only about one seventh of the size of mortgage lending, but it has historically produced 10 times the amount of losses in downturns.The Bank of England will now look at the industry\u2019s ability to cope with consumer credit losses if there is a sharp rise in unemployment. Where it sees a lack of resilience to losses at banks or in specific types of loans it will increase capital requirements, though it is unclear by how much.There is one problem with this. Changes in labor markets have put many more people in jobs with highly variable hours, which means they could suffer falling incomes and repayment problems without becoming unemployed. The central bank is looking at ways to measure this risk.But before any specific consumer credit changes, all banks face higher capital requirements through the return of the countercyclical buffer. This will add \u00a35.7 billion in capital requirements across the industry by June 2018, equivalent to 0.5% on the capital ratios of U.K. balance sheets, and probably the same amount again by the end of 2018.The bank cut the 0.5% that was in place to zero last summer to help banks cope with any increase in risks due to Brexit. The bank said then the move would free up \u00a3150 billion in lending capacity. However, it doesn\u2019t think that move drove consumer credit, which was already growing rapidly. Rather it thinks banks have become overconfident in their assessment of lending risks due to very limited recent losses.They will need to reassess those risks or the Bank of England will do it for them.Write to Paul J.

Plans to roll the program out nationwide are unclear.The consumer installment-lending program is first being offered through roughly 225,000 business clients that also use Square to send and manage their invoices. Eligible consumers who receive an invoice for a service from one of those merchants, which range from wedding photographers to veterinarians, will have the option to finance it over a period of three, six or 12 months.\u201cYou will not see us doing car loans and mortgage loans,\u201d said       Jacqueline Reses,        the executive in charge of Square Capital, the company\u2019s lending arm. \u201cWe want to do things that are relevant to Square sellers.\u201dEach borrower who gets approved will be charged a uniform annual-percentage rate of 9.99% for loans that range from $250 to $10,000.Square\u2019s move into prepaid debit cards earlier this year is part of a separate initiative. It grew from a service called Square Cash that started four years ago as a way to send money to another person using an email address or a phone number. It has since started to morph into a way to pay for goods and services.Last year, Square launched of a virtual card that lets users spend down their balances at online retailers.

Even if Syria still had such arms, he added, it wouldn\u2019t use them.Mr. Trump is scheduled to travel next week to Europe to visit Poland and attend a meeting of the Group of 20 world powers in Hamburg, Germany, where is may also sit down separately with Russian President       Vladimir Putin       for the first time since taking office.The Kremlin spokesman, Mr. Peskov, said Tuesday that a meeting on the sidelines of the Hamburg summit may take place but that full-fledged bilateral talks weren\u2019t yet planned, Interfax reported.Mr. Trump has praised Mr. Putin and emphasized his willingness to meet the Russian leader, but his administration\u2019s increasingly aggressive moves in Syria have triggered a series of confrontations with forces that support Mr. Assad and threaten to widen into a direct clash with the regime in Damascus.\u2014       Noam Raydan       in Beirut contributed to this article.Write to Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 09:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-denounces-trump-chemical-attack-warning-to-syria-1498570667", "news_title": "Russia Denounces Trump Chemical Attack Warning to Syria", "keywords": "russia syria,russia syria u.s.,russia trump,syria chemical weapons,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,risk news,military action,war crimes,chemicals,basic materials,resources"}, {"content": "David Dweck,        55, a real-estate investor from Boca Raton, Fla., on his 1967 Dodge Charger, as told to A.J. Baime.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love, and the 50th birthday of my Dodge Charger. The year 1967 was a huge year for cars and music. I was 5, and it all had a big impact on me.I wanted to do something special, so I shipped my 1967 Charger to Cleveland. I flew my kids Evan and Gabriella in. Along with my girlfriend Elysa, we took a Father\u2019s Day road trip, motoring to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, then to a car show in Akron. After that, my kids left and Elysa and I drove the Charger through Pennsylvania to the Jersey shore, playing a soundtrack of 1967 music along the way.When I was a kid, my parents drove Dodges, and in high school I drove their 1972 Dodge Dart with the famous slant six engine. When I grew up, I wanted to experience those cars again, so I began a small collection of cars. The most special is my 1967 Charger.The Charger was first unveiled for model year 1966, during the first wave of muscle cars. The Mustang was already a sales phenomenon, and the Camaro was about to become one. The original Charger body style only lasted two years, so my 1967 is a rare vehicle today. (The second-generation Charger is the one that became iconic due, in part, to its role as the General Lee in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard.\u201d) I found my car online for sale in Idaho in 2013, and I paid a mechanic a hundred bucks to look at it.I paid $21,000 for the car and had it shipped to Florida. When it arrived, it exceeded my expectations. It\u2019s a performance car, but also a great cruising mobile. I made one modification: I put a CD player and a subwoofer in the trunk, and a speaker box in the back of the car.Over four days on Father\u2019s Day weekend, I put about a thousand miles on the Charger. It performed like a champ. I blared \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band,\u201d the Doors and the Rascals. But when I reached the Jersey shore, I had to play some       Springsteen.

Box will continue to work with Amazon, but Mr. Levie said the new deal, which includes integration with Microsoft products as well as joint sales efforts of combined services, \u201cgoes well beyond what we\u2019ve done with Amazon.\u201dThe deal also opens up markets for Box where customers are required to keep their data stored in the countries in which they reside. In April 2016, the company introduced Box Zones to address data-sovereignty issues; the service is now available in eight countries. A Box spokesman said the new partnership will allow Box to take advantage of Microsoft Azure\u2019s global footprint and offer in-region storage in six additional countries.The combined sales effort will begin shortly. The technology integration should occur over the next two quarters, Mr. Levie said.For Microsoft, the deal builds on efforts to work with rival technologies, rather than fight them. Mr. Guthrie compared the move to Microsoft\u2019s embrace of the rival Linux operating system as well as its decision to make its Office productivity suite of programs available on             Apple Inc.\u2019s       iPad.Box isn\u2019t as fierce a rival to Microsoft as Linux and Apple have been. The companies have worked together before. More than a year ago, they agreed to make Box\u2019s services work more smoothly with Office.Still, Mr. Levie said he has noticed Microsoft\u2019s \u201cnew tone and tenor\u201d in working with tech rivals, rather than just battling them.Write to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-teams-with-smaller-rival-box-on-cloud-technology-1498568404", "news_title": "Microsoft Teams With Smaller Rival Box on Cloud Technology ", "keywords": "box inc. ,cloud computing ,cloud-computing technology,computer software ,microsoft ,Box Inc.,BOX,Microsoft,MSFT,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,marketing,markets,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,usage,consumption statistics,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,digital content services,computing,internet,online,media,entertainment,technology"}, {"content": "Home-price growth slowed in April for the first time in months, a trend that, if it continues, could signal that the market finally is starting to cool as buyers weary of rapid price gains.The S&P             CoreLogic                   Case-Shiller Indices, which covers the entire nation, rose 5.5% in the 12 months ended in April, down from a revised 5.6% year-over-year increase reported in March.Home prices hit a record in September, and the pace of growth had accelerated steadily since then.The 10-city index gained 4.9% over the year, down from 5.2% in March, and the 20-city index gained 5.7%, down from 5.9% the previous month. That is quite a bit below the expectation of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, who expected the 20-city index to rise 6% in April.The accelerating gains have been driven by growing demand thanks to rising wages and a large demographic of people entering their 30s and looking to buy homes, as well as limited supply. Economists have said they are concerned price growth that continues to outpace income growth won\u2019t be sustainable.\u201cThe question is not if home prices can climb without any limit. They can\u2019t. Rather, will home price gains gently slow, or will they crash and take the economy down with them?\u201d said       David Blitzer,        managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \u201cFor the moment, conditions appear favorable for avoiding a crash.\u201dTo be sure, despite the slight slowing, prices are still growing quickly\u2014and much faster than incomes. Home-price growth remains less than half of what it was during the housing bubble in the mid-2000s, when prices grew by more than 14% for much of 2005.Economists are concerned, however, about a handful of markets that have been seeing double-digit or near-double-digit growth. Seattle led the way in April with a 12.9% home-price increase. Portland reported a 9.3% year-over-year gain, and Dallas, which recently replaced Denver in the top three, reported a 8.4% annual increase in home prices.Seven of 20 cities reported greater year-over-year price increases in April than in March.Month-over-month, the U.S. Index rose 0.9% in April before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city rose 0.8% and the 20-city index increased 0.9% from March to April.After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.2% month-over-month, the 10-city also rose 0.2% and the 20-city index rose 0.3%. After seasonal adjustment, 13 of 20 cities saw prices rise in April.Sales of previously owned homes increased in May, in a sign that demand remains strong despite a shortage of homes for sale. Existing home sales rose 1.1% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.62 million, the National Association of Realtors said last week.Write to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/home-price-growth-slows-in-april-1498568416", "news_title": "Home-Price Growth Slows in April", "keywords": "case-shiller,home price index,home prices,s&p case-shiller,u.s. housing market,economic performance,indicators,home sales,housing affordability,economic news,housing prices,real estate markets"}, {"content": "Under Armour Inc.

Those strikes took place as President       Donald Trump       was hosting Chinese President       Xi Jinping       in Florida. The U.S. response was widely welcomed by lawmakers.\u201cThe United States has identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime that would likely result in the mass murder of civilians, including innocent children,\u201d Mr. Spicer said in a statement late Monday.He said the U.S. is engaged in Syria to eliminate Islamic State but warned that if Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad       conducts another attack using chemical weapons, \u201che and his military will pay a heavy price.\u201dTrump administration officials have signaled since the April strike that the U.S. would be willing to take more military action in response to further chemical-weapons use.Since the attack, the U.S. has had a series of confrontations with pro-regime forces in Syria that have made American forces increasingly at risk of direct confrontation with Mr. Assad and his allies from Russia and Iran.Last week, an American jet fighter shot down an Iranian-made armed drone after it flew toward U.S.-led coalition troops in southern Syria. The drone\u2019s downing was the latest of several episodes in recent weeks in which the U.S. brought down pro-regime aircraft viewed as threats to coalition forces and to those Syrian fighters that the U.S. is backing in the fight against Islamic State.Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       and Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister       Sergei Lavrov       spoke on the phone Monday to discuss the Syria conflict, including the need for a cease-fire and steps to deter the use of chemical agents, according to Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry. The U.S. didn\u2019t release its own description of the call.The U.S. and Russia reached a deal in 2013 on an international agreement that aimed to strip the Assad regime of its declared stockpiles of chemical weapons, but the deal has failed to cripple its ability to make or use them. The deal at the time averted a campaign of U.S. airstrikes that the Obama administration was preparing.But, in 2015, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that despite the efforts of the international body overseeing the agreement\u2014the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\u2014Mr. Assad hadn\u2019t given up his chemical weapons, U.S. officials said.The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,       Nikki Haley,        said on Twitter\u00a0on Monday\u00a0that Russia and Iran would bear responsibility for future attacks by the Syrian government. U.S. officials have accused Russia of covering up the\u00a0April 4\u00a0attack.\u201cAny further attacks done to the people of Syria will be blamed on Assad, but also on Russia & Iran who support him killing his own people,\u201d she said.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Sees Signs Syria Preparing For Attack.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 08:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-warns-assad-would-pay-heavy-price-for-another-chemical-attack-1498534633", "news_title": "U.S. Sees Signs Syria Is Prepping Another Chemical Attack", "keywords": "assad regime,chemical weapon attack,chemical weapons,syria chemical weapons,trump syria,u.s. syria ,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,armed forces,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,military action,war crimes,weapons programs,chemicals,basic materials,resources"}, {"content": "Good morning. We kick off the day with the news that the EU has hit Alphabet\u2019s Google with a record \u20ac2.42 billion ($2.71 billion) fine for favoring its comparison-shopping service over competitor products in its search results. Let\u2019s dive in.If Google fails to comply with the ruling and doesn\u2019t change the way it prioritizes its shopping results to treat rivals equally within 90 days, parent company Alphabet could face penalty payments of up to 5% of its average daily global revenue. For a company that earned $90 billion in revenue last year, that\u2019s a lot of money. Google said in a blog post it \u201crespectfully disagree[s]\u201d with the ruling and plans to review it in detail as it considers an appeal.\u2014Microsoft Flashbacks\u2014The judgment is precedent setting, not just for Google, which has two other EU antitrust cases outstanding (over AdSense and Android), but also in the way it demonstrates how Europe\u2019s competition body is ready to bring down the hammer on tech monopolies and regulate the market into being more fair. These cases bring back memories of the European Commission\u2019s antitrust investigation into Microsoft in 2009 over the way it bundled its Internet Explorer in with Windows software. Microsoft has been hit with more than $3 billion in fines to settle its antitrust breaches and Internet Explorer has since lost considerable market share to (ironically) Google\u2019s Chrome and other browsers.Sprint has entered into exclusive talks with Charter Communications and Comcast about a deal for the cable firms to offer wireless services using Sprint\u2019s network, The Wall Street Journal reported. The cable giants may also take a stake in Sprint as part of the arrangement, and the exclusive window for talks through late July puts Sprint\u2019s merger discussions with T-Mobile US on hold for now, according to people familiar with the matter. There are several \u201c4 Ps of marketing\u201d (product, price, place and promotion) implications should the deal go ahead. First, Charter and Comcast adding a mobile-phone offering on more favorable resale terms to their bundles of TV, phone and broadband could help them retain customers with attractive \u201cquad play\u201d promotions. For Sprint, teaming up with Comcast and Charter could help No. 4 U.S. carrier improve its network and make the regulatory case for a T-Mobile merger by bolstering competition in the wireless market.Publicis CEO Arthur Sadoun held a Twitter Q&A on Monday to answer questions about his decision to pull the company out of all awards shows and events for a year and reroute the savings into a new artificial intelligence platform called Marcel, CMO Today\u2019s Alexandra Bruell reports. Mr. Sadoun\u2019s responses came across as lighthearted, but they were often baffling. My favorite moment was when a Twitter user asked Mr. Sadoun to draw a rough sketch on a napkin of what Marcel will actually do. The Publicis boss dutifully responded with this work of art:\u201cIt will put talent at the center,\u201d he said, captioning an image where the word \u201ctalent\u201d was surrounded by arrows, but appeared to be aligned slightly above center and a little to the left.

Please don\u2019t make me be a toaster.\u201d Mr. Sadoun said Marcel will be whatever Publicis people need to be \u201ceven more creative,\u201d adding: \u201cIf they need a toaster, then you\u2019ll be a toaster :)\u201d While amused and now slightly peckish from the Twitter exchanges, I still can\u2019t really tell you what Marcel will actually do.AdAge\u2019s annual 200 Leading National Advertisers report is out, with lots of juicy data about the biggest ad spenders in the U.S. Topping the list for the first time is Geico and its gecko ad mascot, which spent $1.4 billion on measured media in 2016. As far as individual brands go, Geico and Verizon spent more than $1 billion on measured media in the U.S. last year. Comcast, a house of brands, was the leading national advertiser overall for the first time, spending $5.6 billion. Comcast beat out Procter & Gamble, which spent $4.3 billion and is usually a mainstay at the top of AdAge\u2019s annual list, which has been running for 62 years.

Take Tony Davis, a wealthy Manhattan investor. The success of his latest venture depends, in part, on how 25-year-old Chanice St. Louis, who lives in a Brooklyn public-housing project, performs at her new job.Mr. Davis and a co-investor sank $750,000 into a bond issued by C4Q, a startup nonprofit in Long Island City, Queens, that provides free coding classes to low-income adults. The security is backed by the future earnings of this June\u2019s crop of 88 graduates who agreed to pay back 12% of their salaries for two years.It\u2019s a risky investment for Mr. Davis, a hedge-fund co-founder and former Goldman Sachs banker. If the grads don\u2019t land high-paying jobs, he won\u2019t be repaid, much less earn the expected 6.6% return.But he\u2019s not just seeking financial gain. His investment will help C4Q scale up\u2014its incoming class in August is expanding to 144 students hoping to move from low-wage service gigs to higher-paying tech jobs.And if this newfangled funding model works, it could help nonprofit coding schools across the U.S. expand and train more students.It\u2019s unusual for a nonprofit job training program to request a giveback from students, says Michael Hamill Remaley, senior vice president at Philanthropy New York, an association of grant makers. \u201cThis is new to me,\u201d he says. But most such programs, he notes, train students for relatively low wage jobs.C4Q\u2019s founder, Jukay Hsu, a self-described \u201csuper nerdy kid,\u201d has an unusual background. The Taiwanese immigrant grew up in Flushing, Queens, and attended city schools before graduating from Harvard. Then, unlike his pals who went into banking and consulting, he joined the Army.He was struck by the ingenuity and intelligence of the soldiers who never got past high school. \u201cSome of the smartest, hardest-working people I ever met were in the military,\u201d Mr. Hsu says.Returning from Iraq in 2011, he was disappointed to see how many people were missing out on the tech boom transforming the city. He resolved to offer minorities the training and cultural immersion he\u2019d encountered in the military to help them cross the divide.He\u2019s a persuasive fellow. With the help of backing from outfits such Google, Blackstone and LinkedIn, C4Q has taught 200 students to code since 2013. Of 2016\u2019s class of 100, 12 didn\u2019t make it, but of graduates, 90% are working, Mr. Hsu says. Their average salary rose from $18,000 to $85,000, he adds.Ms. St. Louis, who lives in Sheepshead Bay, is a typical grad. She was enrolled in community college in 2013 when her mom took several months off from work to recover from surgery. Determined to help pay for food and rent, Ms. St. Louis took two jobs at the mall. The family scraped by, but her grades were a disaster. The year ended in an academic dismissal.She worked the next two years at places like Bed Bath & Beyond, typically earning about $350 a week. \u201cBut I wanted to go back to school pretty bad,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep working those dead-end jobs.\u201dLast summer, while scooping at a Brooklyn ice cream parlor, a customer told her about C4Q.The 10-month coding program was the biggest challenge she\u2019s faced\u2014eight hours a day of lectures and programming, covering material she at times found incomprehensible. She sometimes felt like quitting.\u201cBut this felt like the last opportunity I might have,\u201d Ms. St. Louis says. \u201cI put a lot of pressure on myself.\u201dWhen she graduated on June 12, she had two job offers. She\u2019s now a web developer at a small Brooklyn startup, earning $65,000 a year. She says she respects the obligation to pay 12% back.\u201cI can make a difference for my community and get other people involved in tech,\u201d Ms. St. Louis says.At this point, the C4Q math doesn\u2019t work at all. Even if every grad lands an $85,000 job, their contribution doesn\u2019t nearly cover the program\u2019s current cost of $30,000 per student. That would require growth on a massive scale.But for now the new model will help the program expand and lessen its reliance on donations. And if it can attract philanthropic investors such as Mr. Davis, is it crazy to think Wall Street money might follow?\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re excited about it,\u201d Mr. Hsu says.\u2014anne.kadet@wsj.comWrite to Anne Kadet at Anne.Kadet@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'A Novel Investment in Others\u2019 Success.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/free-nyc-coding-school-launches-funding-experiment-1498564800", "news_title": "Free NYC Coding School Launches Funding Experiment", "keywords": "training programs,Jukay Hsu,Michael Hamill,Mr. Jukay,Tony Davis,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,education,personal finance,school"}, {"content": "SEOUL\u2014            Samsung Electronics Co.             is quietly rejuvenating its tarnished Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.A refurbished version of the premium smartphone, whose global recall last year garnered unwanted attention for the South Korean technology giant after some caught fire, is coming to retailers\u2019 shelves on July 7 with different components under the name Galaxy Note 7 FE, according to people familiar with the matter.The FE stands for \u201cFandom Edition,\u201d one of the people said.The device will initially be available for consumers in South Korea, with relatively modest inventory for release in other countries yet to be announced, one of the people said, adding that Samsung is expected to release at most 400,000 devices among three major telecom companies in South Korea.The refurbished Note 7 will be priced below 700,000 South Korean won ($616), although smartphone prices are generally adjusted up to the point of release due to fluctuating market conditions, the person said.A spokeswoman for Samsung declined to comment. Samsung said in late March that it planned to sell refurbished or rental versions of the Galaxy Note 7 but didn\u2019t specify timing or targeted markets.Details about the Galaxy Note FE\u2019s release date and pricing were earlier reported by South Korea\u2019s semiofficial Yonhap News agency and local trade media.Samsung recalled around three million Galaxy Note 7 devices last year after reports of some devices catching fire\u2014a debacle that cost the company at least $5 billion and saw the devices banned on various airlines.The South Korean company concluded earlier this year that the overheating in some devices came from design and manufacturing problems with the devices\u2019 batteries. According to Samsung, the defect affected 330 out of the three million Note 7 phones that it sold.Analysts say the revived Note 7 wouldn\u2019t compete with or cannibalize sales of the Galaxy S8, Samsung\u2019s latest flagship smartphone, which was released to much fanfare in April. Unlike the Galaxy S series, the Galaxy Note smartphones feature a larger screen and a stylus, endearing them to a loyal base of fans.\u201cThe Note 7 is a unique product for Samsung,\u201d said Tom Kang, a Seoul-based analyst at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. \u201cThis is a product for Note-series fans so it\u2019s going to address a different market segment from the S8.\u201dMr. Kang added that sales of Galaxy Note 5 devices\u2014the Note 7\u2019s immediate predecessor, since Samsung skipped the number \u201c6\u201d in its Note series\u2014have remained robust in the absence of a viable follow-up in the Note series.Samsung ceded the No. 1 spot in the global smartphone market to rival         Apple Inc.       in the last three months of 2016, thanks in large part to the Galaxy Note 7 recall fiasco.Samsung regained the title in the first quarter of 2017, according to market-research firm Counterpoint.Write to Eun-Young Jeong at Eun-Young.Jeong@wsj.com and Timothy W.

What might not have been expected was that as that spike faded, the decline would potentially be amplified by a renewed drop in oil prices. This raises some awkward questions for markets and policy makers.Oil last week entered a bear market, with prices down 20% from their peak; the price of a barrel of Brent crude is now lower than a year ago. As recently as January, oil prices had almost doubled from a year earlier, helping lift headline inflation to its highest level in years in the U.S. and eurozone.Falling oil has added fuel to a rally in the bond markets as broader hopes of reflation related to U.S. fiscal policy under President       Donald Trump       have fizzled out. The 10-year Treasury yield stands at 2.16%, close to its lowest point this year, and the yield curve has flattened rapidly. The German equivalent is at 0.29%, and has fallen in recent weeks despite evidence of a continuing broad-based eurozone economic recovery.Oil could yet rebound, and its effect might be transitory. But UBS suggests that the changing dynamics of oil prices, with higher production capacity capping rises, mean that there is less need for investors to worry about a surge in energy costs that leads to higher sustained inflation. That in turn reduces the premium investors charge for that risk, lowering yields.This represents a challenge to central banks. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi noted Tuesday that the lack of a clear upward trend in oil and commodity prices is still exerting a drag on headline inflation.Meanwhile, in the U.S. core inflation has been surprisingly soft in recent months, potentially posing a problem for the Federal Reserve, while in the eurozone it has been stuck just below 1% for much of the past three years. A fresh drag on headline inflation from oil would complicate efforts to normalize policy if it lowered wobbly inflation expectations and led wage-setting behavior. Bond markets seem to be internalizing the situation already.For now central banks seem likely to be eager to stay on message, with the gradual phasing out of extraordinary monetary policy in prospect. Mr. Draghi argued that oil prices are being driven by supply, and therefore are something central banks can typically look past. A further drop in oil, however, could yet leave central banks and markets in a sticky situation.Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 07:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-central-banks-need-to-worry-about-falling-oil-prices-1498562900", "news_title": "Why Central Banks Need to Worry About Falling Oil Prices   ", "keywords": "Donald Trump,Mario Draghi,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,euro zone,currency,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,government debt,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Good morning,The Supreme Court on Monday allowed President Trump\u2019s administration to implement part of his temporary ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The court said it would give full consideration to whether the president\u2019s actions were lawful when it hears the case in October. The Supreme Court\u2019s action is a significant reversal of fortune for Mr. Trump, who had been on the losing end of several lower-court decisions that blocked his March 6 executive order. The justices, in an unsigned 13-page opinion, narrowed the scope of the ban for now, ruling that the president couldn\u2019t enforce it against travelers \u201cwho have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship\u201d with a person or organization in the U.S. The court allowed a similarly limited version of a ban on refugees to take effect. Monday was also a landmark day for religious-expression issues at the Supreme Court.The Senate Republican health-care overhaul would swell the ranks of the uninsured by about 22 million and cut the cumulative federal deficit by $321 billion over the next decade compared with the current Affordable Care Act, according to an estimate released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. That assessment threw into doubt whether the bill would make it past an initial procedural hurdle. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was engaged in last-minute negotiations with more than a half-dozen GOP lawmakers wavering in their support of the legislation. Sen. Susan Collins said she would vote against the bill, citing the CBO\u2019s report. The American Medical Association also declared its opposition. However, insurer Anthem said it believed the legislation would bring stability to the individual insurance market.Sprint has entered into exclusive talks with Charter Communications and Comcast as the cable companies explore a deal that could bolster their plans to offer wireless service. Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son and the cable providers have entered into a two-month, exclusive agreement for discussions through late July, putting merger talks between Sprint and T-Mobile on hold. One possible arrangement would have Charter and Comcast invest in improving Sprint\u2019s network in exchange for favorable terms to offer wireless service using the carrier\u2019s network. Such a deal could provide much better terms than the cable companies\u2019 existing network-resale agreement with Verizon. The arrangement could involve Charter and Comcast taking an equity stake in Sprint or jointly acquiring the company, though the latter scenario is thought to be much less likely.Tourism is an important revenue source in Italy, but many residents would prefer that visitors\u2014at least some of them\u2014stay away. The number of tourists arriving in Italy topped 52 million in 2016, up nearly 30% since 2000. Each year, Venice sees 15 million day trippers pour into an area five times the size of New York\u2019s Central Park. The Cinque Terre, the tiny fishing villages on the Italian Riviera, drew 2.5 million visitors last year, 500 times the local population. Recent incidents, such as two tourists swimming nude in Rome\u2019s Trevi Fountain and another diving off the Rialto Bridge in Venice, have only strengthened officials\u2019 determination to find ways to keep the hordes at bay. However, efforts to limit incoming visitors are colliding with legal, business and practical challenges.Once the stuff of science fiction, facial-scanning cameras are becoming a part of daily life in China, where they are used for marketing, surveillance and social control.When the Mailman Unwittingly Becomes a Drug DealerDemocrats\u2019 Broad Challenge: Middle-Class AppealTrump Administration Warns Assad Would Pay \u2018Heavy Price\u2019 for Another Chemical AttackTrump, Indian Prime Minister Modi Move to Bridge DivisionsAir-Bag Maker Takata Has Plenty of Work to Do After Bankruptcy FilingAmazon\u2019s Grocery Ambitions Spell Trouble for Big Food BrandsFor Sale: Puerto RicoWhy Apple and J.P.

Please include your name and location.\u2014Compiled by Margaret RawsonResponding to yesterday\u2019s question on the evolving terror threat in Europe,Massimo Piras of Belgium said: \u201cThe more frequent and random attacks across Europe are clearly affecting people\u2019s moods. With heavily-armed soldiers more and more visible on the streets of Europe, how could it be otherwise? The near impossibility of stopping random, amateurish attacks, combined with the battle-hardened and well-trained militants flowing back into Europe as ISIS loses its twin capitals, will only worsen an already bleak situation.\u201d Jeff Templeton of Pennsylvania wrote: \u201cOne of the best reasons yet why the administration\u2019s policies on immigration need to be implemented. If it\u2019s difficult to track them, then stop them, if possible, at the gate.\u201d And Bob Jones of New Jersey commented: \u201cWith ISIS on the run, these lone-wolf attacks are the death throes of a lost cause.

Some of those conversations, she said, involved former American Realty Chairman Nicholas Schorsch.Ms. McAlister\u2019s lawyer, Caroline Mehta, said Ms. McAlister had no comment beyond her testimony.Lorin Reisner, a lawyer representing Mr. Schorsch, said in an email last week that Mr. Schorsch \u201chas acted lawfully and properly in all respects.\u201d Mr. Reisner added: \u201cGiven the ongoing trial, it would be inappropriate to comment on statements made by counsel or witnesses.\u201dThe defendant in the criminal securities fraud case is American Realty\u2019s former chief financial officer,       Brian Block.       In his opening statement, Daniel Tehrani, an assistant U.S. attorney, alleged Mr. Block \u201cfudged the numbers just enough\u201d that night to get the adjusted funds metric \u201cback to what they wanted,\u201d according to the trial transcript.Mr. Block has denied the charges. His lawyer, Reid Weingarten, said in his opening statement at the jury trial that his client used a \u201clegitimate new add-back\u201d that night and that he believed \u201che was entirely justified doing what he did.\u201d Mr. Weingarten declined to comment beyond the court testimony.Mr. Schorsch, who built American Realty as part of a commercial real-estate empire valued at more than $30 billion, faces numerous civil actions but hasn\u2019t been charged by the\u00a0government. Much of his empire collapsed after the company announced in October 2014 that reporting errors that had been \u201cidentified\u201d by company executives in the second-quarter report were \u201cintentionally not corrected.\u201dMr. Block and Ms. McAlister were forced to resign at that point. In December 2014, Mr. Schorsch resigned from the boards of American Realty and 15 other companies he was overseeing.American Realty, which owns more than $15 billion worth of retail, office and industrial assets, has changed its name to Vereit Inc. It reported earlier this year that it is cooperating with federal investigations that were launched in 2014.The testimony of Ms. McAlister, who has pleaded guilty for her involvement in the alleged fraud and making false statements, shines light on the internal workings of Mr. Schorsch\u2019s empire. She has provided the most detailed account to date of Mr. Schorsch\u2019s alleged connection to critical accounting decisions.Under cross-examination, Ms. McAlister admitted she lied in a letter to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration after she left American Realty claiming to be a whistleblower. She also acknowledged making inaccurate statements in a $50 million defamation lawsuit she filed against American Realty that was later withdrawn. She is cooperating with the government to reduce her sentence and \u201cwill do anything to stay out of jail,\u201d Mr. Weingarten said, noting that she has two children with special needs.\u201cThe very best thing I can do for my kids today is tell the truth,\u201d Ms. McAlister responded.Ms. McAlister described in her testimony a corporate culture at American Realty that was obsessed with hitting its financial projections on Wall Street, particularly the adjusted funds from operations metric. She said the company spelled out its goals on this metric on mouse pads that were delivered to employees.\u201cWe must always hit our own numbers,\u201d Mr. Schorsch wrote in an email, according to Ms. McAlister\u2019s testimony.In early 2014, as American Realty executives were preparing the company\u2019s first-quarter report, they were having difficulty hitting projections. She said the company was able to reach its goal by using an \u201cincorrect\u201d method for calculating adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO.In the next three months leading up to American Realty\u2019s second-quarter filing, company executives discussed the discrepancy on numerous occasions but it wasn\u2019t resolved, Ms. McAlister testified. \u201cFixing the first-quarter mistake would mean that the total AFFO reported in the second-quarter filing would be lower than expected,\u201d said Assistant U.S. Attorney Tehrani in his opening statement.The company was scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings on July 29. The previous evening, Ms. McAlister testified, she was on a conference call with Messrs. Schorsch and Block when the subject of adjusted funds from operations arose.By that time, Mr. Block had calculated the correct number using the right method. But doing that would mean reporting a funds from operations number that was less than what the company had reported in the first quarter and lower than what Wall Street expected, she said.\u201cNick just said, \u2018It\u2019s in the deferred financing costs. There\u2019s your answer,\u2019\u201d Ms. McAlister testified. \u201c\u2019You know what you need to do.\u2019\u201dMs. McAlister testified that a line item used in the calculation of adjusted funds from operations\u2014the amortization of deferred financing costs\u2014was increased by about $12 million. She described the change as an \u201cunsupported adjustment\u201d because it didn\u2019t have \u201can analysis behind it from the books and records to support it.\u201dDuring cross-examination, Ms. McAlister said she listened to the call with Mr. Schorsch on speakerphone at Mr. Block\u2019s desk. She said Mr. Block made no attempt to shield her from the call. She also said she had no knowledge of prior conversations Mr. Block had with Mr. Schorsch on the subject.\u201cIt was my understanding that Nick knew what Brian was talking about, and he was bringing up different line items and then Nick just jumped all over the deferred financing costs amortization,\u201d she said.Final summations are expected later this week.", "news_time": "2017-06-27 07:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/witness-says-real-estate-magnate-schorsch-played-role-in-fraud-scheme-1498561380", "news_title": "Witness Says Real-Estate Magnate Schorsch Played Role in Fraud Scheme ", "keywords": "accounting fraud,american realty case,american realty scandal,commercial real estate,nicholas schorsch,reits,schorsch fraud,Lisa McAlister,Nicholas Schorsch,political,general news,crime,legal action,fraud"}, {"content": "A Chinese logistics company backed by technology giants             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.       and             Foxconn Technology                   Group filed for an initial public offering in the U.S., according to securities filings.Best Logistics Technologies Ltd., based in Alibaba\u2019s hometown of Hangzhou, said Monday it plans to offer its American depositary shares on             Nasdaq                   or the New York Stock Exchange.

Chemical companies say the boom in drilling that has expanded output of oil and gas has also lowered the prices for the primary ingredients in plastic pellets, the WSJ\u2019s Christopher M. Matthews reports, putting a premium on the logistics needed to move the industrial materials through a U.S. Gulf Coast region largely focused on energy shipments. The pellets are used in manufacturing and turned into a range of goods, including plastic containers and toys. The growth has prompted staggering investment:             Dow Chemical Co.        DOW 1.55%       is working on $8 billion in new and expanded U.S. petrochemical facilities, part of the industry\u2019s largest transformation in a generation. Chevron Phillips has met a shortage of shipping containers by creating a fleet of 2,750 railcars to get the pellets to ports in Long Beach, Calif., and Charleston, S.C., with strong demand in Asia and South America making up for the logistics costs.There\u2019s a growing dark side to the parcel business bringing global trade to every American household. Authorities say synthetic narcotics are now streaming into the U.S. through international parcels delivered by the U.S. Postal Service and private carriers, helping fuel an opioid crisis that claims tens of thousands of U.S. lives each year. The WSJ\u2019s Arian Campo-Flores and Jon Kamp write the flow of drugs has gotten the attention of congressional lawmakers, who are proposing tougher rules and new resources to stem the flood. Seizures of fentanyl arriving by both international mail and express carriers have soared, but authorities say the enormous growth in the trade is far outpacing enforcement efforts. While Mexican drug cartels usually transport synthetic opioids like fentanyl in bulk by land across the southern U.S. border, many American dealers and users use the mail to receive smaller supplies, challenging efforts to find the drugs among the many millions of packages moving through distribution networks.These are good times for Chinese logistics companies. Best Logistics Technologies Ltd., a business backed by             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.       and             Foxconn Technology                   Group, is planning an initial public offering in the U.S., the WSJ\u2019s Austen Hufford writes, hoping to draw from the rush of investment dollars that have flowed to companies supporting the country\u2019s rapidly growing e-commerce industry. China package delivery company ZTO Express Inc. raised $1.4 billion in its U.S. IPO last October, and shares in parcel carrier SF Express have soared since its listing last year in Shenzhen. Best Logistics has more of an industrial profile than those operators, with a lineup of warehouses it has used to build up distribution capability. The company was valued at more than $3 billion after raising $760 million from new investors last year. Its biggest asset may be its strategic partnership with Alibaba, which has fueled big revenue growth that may help cover over investor concerns over the company\u2019s persistent losses.Mescal, tequila\u2019s smokier cousin, is defying attempts to meet growing demand. The increasingly popular spirit has made the leap from the rugged mountains of Mexico to trendy U.S. bars, the WSJ\u2019s Robbie Whelan reports, but the world\u2019s biggest liquor companies are struggling to parlay its popularity into substantial profits. That\u2019s because mescal has become one of the rare products challenging attempts to speed up and build out supply chains. The things driving the spirit\u2019s rise\u2014including handcrafted production and the long growing time for the agave used in distillation\u2014also make it hard to produce on a large scale. France\u2019s             Pernod Ricard SA,       Bacardi Ltd., Jose Cuervo and             Diageo                   PLC all have either acquired, launched or struck distribution deals with high-end mescal brands. They\u2019re looking to boost earnings hurt by declining world-wide alcohol consumption. Mescal exports are growing, but the contribution to profits so far remains a drop in the bucket.Plenty of technology-focused startups are going after last-mile delivery, but New York-based Homer Logistics is taking an unusual path. The company is teaming its route-efficiency software with some 300 full-time couriers, and even provides them with benefits and stock options, the WSJ\u2019s Yuliya Chernova writes, a turn away from the \u201cgig\u201d economy model many companies use to enlist independent contractors. Homer Logistics has been capitalizing on the broader drive toward home delivery of consumer products that has retailers and food providers booting up local delivery efforts. The company has raised $14.5 million, and just closed its Series A funding round at $8.5 million. CEO Adam Price says he could scale the business up faster using contract workers, but the growth wouldn\u2019t be sustainable. And having employees also helps in implementing Homer\u2019s routing software, which Mr. Price considers a major advantage.\u2018Everyone has the same great idea at the same time in this industry.

As the yuan slumped, capital fled the country. Alarmed, the central bank dove back into currency-control mode and clamped down on capital outflows\u2014reversing years of market opening.Today, yuan deposits in Hong Kong, the leading offshore center for Chinese currency trading, have shriveled. And we\u2019re back to a loose yuan peg against the dollar.Crises have a way of exposing the government\u2019s deep-seated fears of market forces. The regime sees rises and falls in the stock indexes as a barometer of public confidence toward its performance, and the true test of the MSCI\u2019s cautious welcome of domestic \u201cA\u201d shares will come next time they take a dive.In 2015, when a bubble burst, the government panicked. It ordered massive buying by state-owned companies, scared off short sellers with legal threats and put all initial public offerings on ice. The \u201cnational team\u201d of buyers sent in to prevent a worse rout still owns a big chunk of the market.Some lessons have been learned. However, the mainly technical improvements that finally convinced the MSCI to include 222 \u201cA\u201d shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen in the index don\u2019t address the deeper failings of the system.The state\u2019s heavy hand in the economy is increasing. Economic overhauls under President       Xi Jinping       have stalled, or in some cases reversed. Moreover, as       Eswar Prasad,        a Cornell economist and former head of the IMF for China points out, the leadership has \u201cunequivocally repudiated political, legal, and institutional reforms,\u201d which undermines long-term confidence in the economy.The stock market is hostage to the reflexes of an insecure leadership.Consider last week\u2019s unexpected instruction by China\u2019s media regulator to social-media companies to stop streaming video and audio, part of a censorship drive to combat \u201cnegative speech.\u201d Immediately, Nasdaq-listed Weibo, which has staged a remarkable revival in the past two years on the strength of video ads, lost $1 billion in market value.Or recent sweeping checks on the borrowings of overseas deal makers that have invested in everything from highflying soccer clubs to marquee hotels and a Hollywood studio.Ostensibly, that action is aimed at cracking down on spiraling debt. Yet, given the way that political patronage weaves through Chinese business circles, speculation is rife that the tycoons have been caught up in a factional power play ahead of a key Communist Party meeting in the fall. Nobody really knows.Optimists reckon that the IMF and MSCI moves strengthen the hand of Chinese technocrat reformists, who seek to use internationalization of the markets to spur more fundamental changes to the operations of wasteful state enterprises and spendthrift local governments.But the forces of resistance are stubbornly entrenched. Whatever happened to the theory, popular in the U.S. Clinton administration, that rewarding China with membership in the World Trade Organization in 2001 would lead to ever-expanding market opportunities for U.S. businesses, if not democracy?It turned out that China\u2019s WTO accession, rather than ushering in a new era of reforms, represented their high point. Today, China\u2019s domestic markets are closing, state enterprises are skewing competition against multinationals as never before, and the chief U.S. trade negotiator during the WTO process,       Charlene Barshefsky,        accuses Mr. Xi of trying to \u201cSinicize the Chinese economy.\u201dLikewise, the IMF\u2019s gift to China was the signal for retrenchment, not advance.Will the MSCI arrangement produce different results? Domestic investors weren\u2019t impressed: the indexes hardly budged on the news.Still, there\u2019s plenty of international interest. No matter that China\u2019s casino-like bourses are dominated by mom-and-pop investors, and plagued by insider trading: They are too big to ignore. With a capitalization of $7.5 trillion, they trail only the U.S. in size.Morgan Stanley,       the former parent of MSCI, isn\u2019t buying all the gloom about China.While others brace for a financial shock, its equity researchers in a recent report see a golden decade ahead during which the country will achieve high-income status. They\u2019re bullish on Chinese stocks.Chin-Ping Chia,        MSCI\u2019s head of Asian research, compared adding China to the indexes with \u201cthe opening of the Great Wall.\u201dNow that the barrier has been breached, though, the incoming armies of investors should gird for a struggle.Write to Andrew Browne at andrew.browne@wsj.comAppeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Chinese Stocks Held Hostage to Nation\u2019s Insecurities.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 05:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hostage-to-chinas-insecurity-its-markets-1498556454", "news_title": "China\u2019s Insecure Leaders Won\u2019t Let Their Markets Be Free", "keywords": "china's world,china markets,china stock-market crash,chinese economy,msci,shanghai stock exchange,shenzhen stock exchange,stock markets,weibo,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,energy commentary,routine market,financial news,refined product market commentary"}, {"content": "LOWELL, Mass.\u2014Sen. Elizabeth Warren is traveling to Trump-friendly areas of her state hoping to connect with his backers and provide a road map for her party to win back working-class voters.Ms. Warren\u2019s message echoes the gloomy assessment of the U.S. economy that President Donald Trump sketched out during the 2016 campaign, though her prescription for addressing it is diametrically opposite.At a weekend town hall meeting here, the Massachusetts Democrat began with a treatise about how the economy worked far better for the middle class in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Now, Ms. Warren said, the middle class is no longer an equal partner in the nation\u2019s economic growth and there is little hope for anyone who is not rich, powerful and connected.\u201cIt is not the America of our dreams,\u201d she told about 500 people who packed into a steamy hall at a local job-training agency. \u201cIt is the America of our nightmares.\u201dDuring last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Lowell became the exemplar of the down-on-its-luck places where Mr. Trump filled drew large crowds. A mile from where Ms. Warren held her town hall, Mr. Trump spoke before a packed 6,500-seat hockey arena in January 2016.Mr. Trump won 60% of Lowell\u2019s GOP primary vote in what was then still a five-candidate field. Democratic presidential candidate       Hillary Clinton       won the city in the general election, but Mr. Trump carried four of the five towns that border it.In May, Ms. Warren held a town hall in Ware, a central Massachusetts town won by Mr. Trump. Her team is planning more events in a band across the state\u2019s midsection that, according to an April WBUR poll, remains supportive of the president and skeptical of Ms. Warren.Ms. Warren\u2019s message: Things are unfair; Washington is to blame; and without major changes the country will be irreparably harmed.\u201cWe talk about how the middle class has just taken one punch after another for nearly 40 years now,\u201d she told the Lowell crowd. \u201cUnderstand that Donald Trump and these Republican majorities are poised to deliver the knockout blow.\u201dThat blow, Ms. Warren said, comes from GOP efforts to roll back Obama-era financial regulations and the Affordable Care Act, along with increasingly burdensome student loan debt load on new college graduates.Though she is holding events in Trump-friendly areas, Ms. Warren has drawn supportive crowds.Among those who asked questions of Ms. Warren was Jennifer Daniel, an unemployed 30-year-old from nearby Methuen. Ms. Daniel said her husband, an Army veteran, used his GI Bill education benefits to attend a for-profit college that closed in 2016 four months before he was to graduate.\u201cThis is not right,\u201d Ms. Warren told her from the stage. \u201cEveryone in this room recognizes the responsibility that we have to you and to each other to stop this kind of cheating on veterans. This is just wrong.\u201dNow homeless, unemployed and five months pregnant, Ms. Daniel said in an interview after the event that she voted for Green Party candidate Jill Stein last November because she couldn\u2019t bring herself to back Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI was disillusioned,\u201d Ms. Daniel said. Mr. Trump winning, she said, \u201cfelt like it was meant to happen.\u201dWhile Democrats across the country wrestle with the question of how to win back voters who rallied to Mr. Trump, Ms. Warren\u2019s aides say her outreach to parts of the state that favored the president is strictly to hear from Massachusetts voters. She isn\u2019t likely to face a serious challenge next year, when she is up for a second term in the Senate.The 68-year-old Ms. Warren refuses to publicly entertain the question of whether she will run for president in 2020. Told by a questioner here that \u201cmost of us want you to run for president in 2020,\u201d she batted away the idea with a reminder that she is on the ballot in Massachusetts first.\u201cCan I just say, \u2018Warren 2018?\u2019\u201d she replied.Ms. Warren\u2019s evasiveness hasn\u2019t stopped Republican groups and Mr. Trump from making her the focus of their attacks. Mr. Trump, in a Sunday\u00a0interview on the Fox News Channel, called her \u201ca hopeless case.\u201d\u201cI actually think that she is just somebody that\u2019s got a lot of hatred, a lot of anger,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think she\u2019s a highly overrated voice.\u201dAmerica Rising, an Arlington, Va.-based GOP opposition research group, in April made Ms. Warren the centerpiece of an effort to attack would-be 2020 Democratic presidential candidates with a project dubbed \u201cThe Elizabeth Warren\u00a0Initiative.\u201d The super PAC\u2019s executive director, Colin Reed, said going after Ms. Warren is \u201ca major priority.\u201dMs. Warren says her immediate focus is on fighting the Republican health-care legislation and mounting her 2018 re-election campaign. But she hasn\u2019t been shy about seeking to pull fellow Democrats and those running in next year\u2019s midterm elections to the left.Blocking the GOP rollback of provisions in the Affordable Care Act, Ms. Warren said, is not enough. She said Democrats on the ballot in the next two federal elections should back a national single-payer health-care plan.\u201cPresident Obama tried to move us forward with health-care coverage by using a conservative model that came from one of the conservative think tanks that had been advanced by a Republican governor in Massachusetts,\u201d she said during an interview in her Senate office last week. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for the next step. And the next step is single payer.\u201dIn Lowell, Ms. Warren said there is broad support for raising the minimum wage, expanding Social Security, forgiving student loan debt and installing tougher federal regulations on the financial services industry.Democrats, she said, would do better if they campaigned on that progressive platform rather than blurring the lines between themselves and Republicans.\u201cThe progressive agenda is America\u2019s agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re trying to sell stuff that people don\u2019t want\u2026It\u2019s not that at all. It\u2019s that we haven\u2019t gotten up there and been as clear about our values as we should be, or as clear and concrete about how we\u2019re going to get there.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-27 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-warren-tries-to-win-back-voters-in-trump-country-1498555802", "news_title": "Elizabeth Warren Tries to Win Back Voters in Trump Country ", "keywords": "democratic party,democrats,elizabeth warren,minimum wage,obamacare,presidential election,single payer,student debt,working class voters,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "The Trump administration is struggling to find a nominee for the Federal Reserve board with community banking experience, delaying plans to fill two other Fed vacancies, including a key regulatory post.The problem: They can\u2019t find somebody willing to take the job.Ethics rules require Fed governors and their immediate family members to divest themselves of holdings in any financial firms to avoid potential conflicts of interest. But many of the country\u2019s small banks are privately held and run by third- or fourth-generation executives.Since President Donald Trump took office, at least three community banker candidates who had been recommended for the job either bowed out or declined to be considered over concerns about selling their stakes in their banks, according to people familiar with the matter.This reluctance has held up the administration\u2019s plans to submit nominees for all three Fed board openings together to the Senate for confirmation. It could delay the community banker nomination into the fall, the people said.The divestiture requirement is \u201can impediment to the administration finding a community banker, unless they find a retired banker who\u2019s already divested their interests,\u201d said Camden Fine, the chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America.The problem isn\u2019t a new one\u2014the Obama administration also had trouble finding a community banker willing to be considered for the position\u2014but it has broader implications for the Trump administration\u2019s regulatory agenda.Mr. Trump has three vacancies to fill on the seven-member Fed board. He also can nominate any board member to serve as vice chairman for supervision, a role created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law but never formally filled during the Obama administration.Without a vice chairman for supervision, the Trump administration is missing a key player to carry out its plans for overhauling financial regulations, including rolling back portions of Dodd-Frank.White House spokeswoman       Natalie Strom       said in a statement, \u201cThe President takes the responsibility of nominating individuals to the Federal Reserve board very seriously, as whoever he chooses will have a major impact on the future of U.S. economic policy. We are in the process of reviewing a wide range of incredibly qualified candidates for all the open positions on the board and will announce the President\u2019s selections at the appropriate time.\u201dAs reported in April, Mr. Trump is expected to nominate       Randal Quarles,        a top Treasury Department official in the       George W. Bush       administration, to the regulatory post. He also is considering former Richmond Fed economist       Marvin Goodfriend       for another board slot.The quest for a candidate with small-bank experience is part strategy, and part necessity.Community bankers generally enjoy broad support on Capitol Hill. Packaging the nomination of a small-bank candidate with two other Fed nominees could make it easier for all three to win Senate approval, though the administration could choose to move ahead with two nominees.Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act two years ago to require that at least one Fed board member have community banking experience. The Obama administration sought out small bankers to meet the requirement, but encountered similar difficulties as Trump officials.\u201cJust the prospect of having to sell, divest myself and my family of my organization\u2014that does not support community banking into the future in my opinion,\u201d said       Rebeca Romero Rainey,        CEO of Centinel Bank in Taos, N.M., who had been under consideration for a Fed seat during the Obama administration.President       Barack Obama       nominated retired Bank of Hawaii CEO       Allan Landon       in early 2015, but the Senate never voted on his nomination, which expired when Mr. Obama left office.Trump administration officials have been searching for possible Fed candidates since the weeks after the November election. During a\u00a0March 9\u00a0meeting at the White House, Mr. Trump told a group of community bankers that he was very close to naming a person with small-bank experience to the Fed.Once a regulatory nominee is selected, the process for security and ethics reviews takes about two months.The administration could satisfy the community banker requirement with a state bank regulator. Several names of state bank regulators were submitted to the administration, according to sources, but it isn\u2019t clear they are being seriously considered for the job.Some bankers approached for the seat said it was difficult to leave the private sector for what is likely a lower-paying government job with term limits, said people familiar with the matter. These people also noted a concern about being a political appointee, and how that would be perceived when they eventually return to the private sector.Besides a person\u2019s financial holdings, another consideration related to the Fed job is a statutory requirement that not more than one member of the Fed\u2019s governing board come from the same Fed district. In the past, presidents have defined representation of a district somewhat loosely, but the White House likely can\u2019t ignore the requirement altogether.\u2014Ryan Tracy and Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Write to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com and Rachel Witkowski at rachel.witkowski@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-struggles-to-find-community-banker-for-fed-board-1498555801", "news_title": "Trump Administration Struggles to Find Community Banker for Fed Board", "keywords": "community banks,fed,fed board,fed board of governors,fed community bank,federal reserve nominations,fed nominations,trump,trump fed,trump nominations,Federal Reserve board,Rebeca Romero Rainey,Allan Landon,Marvin Goodfriend,Natalie Strom,Randal Quarles,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,monetary policy,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Over the past quarter century, the North American Free Trade Agreement has done much to transform the region\u2019s economy, rewiring supply chains, shaking up labor markets, altering consumer choices and integrating border towns. The vast range of commerce touched by the pact will be evident this week, when the Trump administration holds marathon public hearings over plans to rewrite the deal with Mexico and Canada.Beginning with an 11-hour session slated to open at 8:50 a.m. Tuesday, the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office plans three days of hearings, churning through more than 130 witnesses.\u00a0 Many of the speakers during the 24 hours of discussion are predictable players at such events: representatives of the AFL-CIO, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and prominent trade academics.But the variety of speakers shows the widespread interest in the pact, with a long list of industries, unions and activists looking to protect what they\u2019ve gained since the 1994 launch, to make up for what they\u2019ve lost, or to take advantage of the opportunity for change.The kickoff session includes textile makers, the U.S. Fashion Industry Association, and the Rubber and Plastic Footwear Manufacturers Association. They\u2019ll be followed by representatives of the agriculture sector\u2014one of Nafta\u2019s big winners\u2014hailing from tomato, strawberry, wheat and corn growers, as well as three different cattlemen\u2019s trade groups. Those speakers will be joined by the Pet Food Institute and the National Renderers Association, the trade group for the industry that recycles livestock slaughterhouse byproducts, among other things, into soaps, paints, and the like.The recording industry, the motion pictures association, the Library Copyright Alliance, and the Consortium for Common Food Names will help round out the Tuesday session, accompanied by the National Football League, which is fighting with Canada over broadcast advertising rules.Auto makers, truck drivers and the Council on Safe Transportation of Hazardous Articles will get their say Wednesday, along with Global Justice for Animals and the Environment and the Center for Water Security and Cooperation. The wrap-up Thursday includes the Visual Effects Industry, the American Cancer Society, and the Western Canada Alliance of Wall and Ceiling Contractors.The intense interest in Nafta has been spurred by President Donald Trump\u2019s harsh criticism of the sweeping pact as \u201ca disaster,\u201d and his April threat to pull out abruptly and completely. That has sparked a robust defense from Nafta advocates who had long taken the agreement for granted, and raised hopes for critics looking for fix what they see as longstanding problems. It also creates openings for lobbyists seeking business anytime Washington reopens a big program, whether it\u2019s a trade agreement, the tax law, or financial regulation.In the month after U.S. Trade Representative       Robert Lighthizer\u2019s       mid-May notification to Congress that the pact would be renegotiated, his agency got more than 12,000 public comments on the matter, crashing the server and forcing him to extend the comment period.Write to Jacob M.

Ms. Matos said a doctor mentioned that the asthma symptoms could be caused by mold exposure.According to an Austin Independent School District report, a classroom inspection requested by Ms. Matos found high levels of Aspergillus or Penicillium mold\u2014common triggers for allergy-like responses. The district, where buildings average 40 years old, has discovered mold at five schools and a parking garage since 2015, according to maintenance director       Louis Zachary.The problems in Austin are among dozens of documented cases in which K-12 schools and colleges nationwide have detected mold in the past year. Fixing the problem costs anywhere from a few hundred dollars for replacement air-conditioner parts or new carpeting, to hundreds of thousands of dollars for more comprehensive cleaning and repairs.While mold is present outdoors and in many buildings, poorly maintained pipes and air conditioners in aging structures, which are often closed for weeks or months between semesters, make classrooms and dormitories particularly ripe for the fungal growth, mold and facilities experts say.The University of Richmond, Northwestern University, East Carolina University and Beloit College all contended with mold problems in dormitories this past school year.Jessica Monberg       started feeling ill her first week of freshman year at Indiana University last fall, and coughing fits and bouts of fatigue grew worse as the semester wore on.School officials saw mold, including in an air vent, and an inspection turned up moderate levels of Aspergillus or Penicillium.\u201cI just had a huge allergic reaction,\u201d said Ms. Monberg, who is 19 years old.The school ultimately spent $568,220 cleaning and fixing nearly 1,000 air handling units in two dorms in February.\u201cWe wanted to make sure that we didn\u2019t have, pardon the pun, a growing problem,\u201d said       Thomas Morrison,        vice president for capital planning at Indiana University.Similarly, Texas Christian University cleaned air systems after it was notified that a basketball player,       Gabe Adzich,        had become ill last fall with symptoms including tingling hands, dizziness, fatigue and chest pains. The ailments began soon after he moved into his dorm for freshman year.By November he had migraines and memory problems. A battery of tests led to diagnoses including anxiety, esophagitis and malignant growths in Mr. Adzich\u2019s colon, he and his mother said.A private environmental inspector hired by Mr. Adzich\u2019s mother in November found a number of common mold types in the dorm room, according to the inspection report, which was viewed by The Wall Street Journal.TCU hired an independent air-quality firm that found mold that \u201cdid not constitute a health risk\u201d to occupants, a school spokeswoman said, but the school cleaned the air register and duct work in the room \u201cas a precautionary measure.\u201dDoctors say individuals can have sensitivities to the more common molds that were found in Mr. Adzich\u2019s room, and there is some controversy over what causes those reactions.TCU has been cleaning the air systems in all residence halls, a project it expects to complete in August.It also sent the Adzich family a $10,000 check to cover property the family said had been contaminated.Nevada-based       Dr. James Craner,        who evaluates patients who have been exposed to mold and other environmental or occupational hazards, said opting for cheap, quick fixes or ignoring the potential danger of water intrusion problems comes at a long-term cost.Appropriately detecting and removing mold, he said, is \u201ca construction and economic issue with significant public-health implications.\u201dJon Ray,        superintendent of the Klamath-Trinity Joint Unified School District in Humboldt County, Calif., said his district has had to put roughly $65 million into repairs, demolition and new construction after it found wet ceiling tiles in 2014 that led to the discovery of widespread mold and other issues across six of the district\u2019s seven schools, as well as other problems.Environmental tests found elevated levels of Basidiospores, which are rare indoors and grow on mushrooms, as well as Stachybotrys, which produces dangerous mycotoxins. Wood had completely rotted away in some places, making the buildings structurally unsound, Mr. Ray said.The district, with an annual operating budget of $19 million, tapped state funds and is hoping for federal money to handle the rest of the remediation on 1950s-era buildings, which includes dealing with lead paint and asbestos that require careful handling. Klamath-Trinity has had to cancel weeks of classes over the past year and a half and is still only about halfway done with the project.\u201cThe mold was a problem. The cleanup was a bigger problem,\u201d Mr. Ray said.Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com and Tawnell D.

One simple reason is that the economy has never looked so calm.Stocks are having one of their quietest periods in history, despite the unsettled politics and uncertain direction of policy in both the U.S. and abroad. The average daily swing in S&P 500 in the soon-to-be completed second quarter has been 0.3 percentage points, the lowest in more than half a century.One factor underpinning the lack of volatility in stocks: Economic volatility, both in the U.S. and abroad, is extraordinarily low. The risk is that, after a long period of not getting blindsided by the economy, investors may be too complacent.Over the past three years, the standard deviation of the annualized change in U.S. gross domestic product\u2014how far it has tended to swing each quarter from its underlying trend\u2014is just 1.5 percentage points, or about as low as it has ever been. It is a trend that is being matched elsewhere, with global GDP exhibiting the lowest volatility in history.A portion of the decline in GDP volatility, both in the U.S. and globally, probably stems from slower economic growth\u2014in absolute terms, a lower number naturally varies less. But other economic measures that aren\u2019t all that low relative to history, such as U.S. jobs growth and corporate profits, also are exhibiting low volatility. So there are other factors at work.Some are longstanding. Government spending isn\u2019t as lumpy as it used to be. The service sector, which is inherently less choppy (and harder to precisely measure and therefore often estimated using trends) than manufacturing and other goods producers, counts for more of the economy. Technology has given businesses better insight into inventory levels and supply chains, reducing the risk of getting caught with a pile of unsold goods.Other reasons for a drop in economic volatility have a more recent vintage. In the years since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have acted like the overprotective parents of a toddler, rushing in whenever the economy looked as if it might stumble. That risk-averse behavior has extended to businesses, making them unwilling to take chances on investments with less certain payoffs. Housing activity, which helped drive past boom-and-bust cycles, has been consistently soft throughout the recovery.Globally, economic volatility has been muted not only because individual economies are shaking less, but because they have become less correlated with one another, points out J.P. Morgan economist       Joseph Lupton.       Like a diversified portfolio, they are offsetting each other, bringing overall volatility lower.For investors, low economic volatility is a good thing, since they get hit by fewer surprises. But it also can lure them into complacency and leave them more vulnerable when things bounce around again. Indeed, the economy was unusually placid right before both the dot-com bust in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008.

According to that university report, \u201cAt present, there is not an IAQ [indoor air quality] problem, however the general level of cleanliness in the apartment needs to be addressed to prevent environmental conditions that are favorable for fungal growth.\u201dMr. Straus reviewed Duke\u2019s report. \u201cMessy students are not the problem,\u201d he said, adding that the types of mold the outside inspector hired by Ms. Drazan found require significant amounts of water to grow.Larry Moneta,        vice president of student affairs at Duke, said the school\u2019s 2015 report showed the more dangerous type of mold \u201cdoes not exist, has never existed\u201d in Ms. Drazan\u2019s former apartment, which was built in the 1970s. He said he couldn\u2019t comment on any report other than the one done by his school\u2019s \u201chighly reputable and reliable testers.\u201d The school\u2019s report acknowledged that its findings were different from the one commissioned by Ms. Drazan.Last fall, Duke confirmed that other types of mold were detected in the area known as Central Campus, where Ms. Drazan had lived the prior year. The school said it found high levels of humidity and some common environmental fungi, but none that produce dangerous mycotoxins.The school recently broke ground on a new, 500-bed residential hall and expects to stop housing students in Central Campus by summer 2019.Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/one-student-apartment-two-mold-test-results-1498555803", "news_title": "One Student Apartment, Two Mold-Test Results", "keywords": "mold, mold testing, universities,political,general news,education,university,college"}, {"content": "A pledge by central bankers to keep interest rates low and tolerate above-target inflation at some future time in order to counter a current shock is likely to be less powerful than generally thought, write       Alex Haberis,       Richard Harrison       and       Matt Waldron      on Bank Underground.

Or you could monitor Chinese electricity production.A side effect of China\u2019s increasing weight in global commodities markets is that its industrial cycle, mostly driven by housing construction, weighs ever heavier on global inflation data. Anyone puzzling over weak U.S. inflation numbers in April and May should look across the Pacific.China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy, but it is still a small export market for the U.S. relative to Canada or the European Union. It mainly feeds into the U.S. economy through its enormous and increasing weight in global energy, metal and chemical markets, which in turn drive the price of nearly everything you buy.Chinese indicators of heavy industrial growth such as steel and electricity production have lined up closely with U.S. inflation over the past decade. The correlation between U.S. consumer-price inflation and a moving average of growth in Chinese electricity use was weakly positive from 1997 to 2007: 0.4 on a scale of zero to one. Over the past decade, that figure has risen to 0.64, and over the past year it has been 0.91, indicating nearly perfect correlation.The tightening link suggests a big part of the U.S. inflation uptick in late 2016 and early 2017 was probably due to the shot in the arm global resource markets got from China\u2019s 2016 stimulus. \u201cHard\u201d economic indicators related to industrial growth rose strongly in China in late 2016 and early 2017, unlike in the U.S.China\u2019s economy is cooling as that stimulus winds down and domestic construction slows. But in the U.S., there are signs of rebounding consumption and growth, in part because of cooling prices, particularly for oil. In other words, the outlook is for benign global inflation as Chinese real estate slows and steadier growth in the U.S. That should be positive for stocks and enable a slower liftoff from the Fed on interest rates.Federal Reserve Bank of New York President       William Dudley       put it best in his recent public comments: With both inflation and unemployment low, \u201cthis is actually a pretty good place to be.\u201d That sort of thinking should cheer stock investors.

Mr. Moon said during his election campaign earlier this year that he would seek closer ties with North Korea, particularly through economic cooperation, sparking concerns about a policy misalignment with Washington.Ms. Kang acknowledged those concerns Monday, but also offered the firmest reassurances yet from the new government, saying Mr. Moon sought only to upgrade South Korea\u2019s relationship with the U.S. \u201cfrom good to great.\u201dA spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Seoul said the embassy welcomed Ms. Kang\u2019s highlighting of the strength of the alliance with the U.S. and the two countries\u2019 shared views on North Korea ahead of this week\u2019s summit.On the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, system, which has been seen as an early test of Messrs. Trump and Moon\u2019s relationship, Ms. Kang called the deployment \u201can alliance decision,\u201d and said Mr. Moon would work closely with Washington \u201con the basis of mutual trust.\u201d\u201cMy government has no intention to basically reverse the commitments made in the spirit of the ROK-U.S. alliance,\u201d Ms. Kang said, using the acronym for South Korea\u2019s formal name, the Republic of Korea.She added that Mr. Moon, like Mr. Trump, was focused on reining in North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile program.\u201cPresident Moon and President Trump see eye to eye on North Korea nuclear and missile issues,\u201d Ms. Kang said. \u201cMy administration\u2019s position mirrors that of \u2018maximum pressure and engagement,\u2019\u201d she said, employing a phrase used to describe the Trump administration\u2019s North Korea policy.Messrs. Trump and Moon, both of whose administrations are relatively young, have shown signs of friction over Thaad, which the U.S. says is designed to defend against a North Korean missile attack.The U.S. and South Korea agreed last year under Mr. Moon\u2019s unpopular conservative predecessor to deploy Thaad in South Korea, and Seoul\u2019s defense ministry secured a golf course in the country\u2019s south on which to install the system.During his election campaign, Mr. Moon criticized the decision-making process as opaque, and vowed to review the decision as president. Just days before Mr. Moon\u2019s election, the U.S. declared Thaad baseline operational following two overnight shipments of missile-defense hardware, sparking suspicions among Mr. Moon and his advisers that the U.S. was seeking to rush Thaad into place before Mr. Moon came to power.Mr. Trump also roiled the South Korean campaign by suggesting that South Korea should pay for the roughly $1 billion             Lockheed Martin Corp.      -made system, remarks that National Security Adviser Lt. Gen.       H.R. McMaster       later walked back.\u2018President Moon and President Trump see eye to eye on North Korea nuclear and missile issues\u2019For his part, Mr. Moon later lambasted his defense ministry for keeping him in the dark about the progress of Thaad\u2019s installment. Days later, he ordered the U.S. to stop further deployment of Thaad.On a separate issue, Ms. Kang said Monday that Mr. Moon\u2019s campaign-trail suggestion that South Korea should reopen a closed business park operated jointly with North Korea would take place only \u201cwithin the framework of international sanctions.\u201dThe suggestion that South Korea reopen the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a frequent demand of Pyongyang since its closure last year, has raised questions about whether such a venture would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions prohibiting business dealings with North Korea.\u201cThis is not something we can discuss at this stage when we are ratcheting up pressure on Pyongyang,\u201d Ms. Kang said of the business park, which is seen as a symbol of economic cooperation with North Korea.Ms. Kang, South Korea\u2019s first female foreign minister and a former top United Nations official, emphasized her father\u2019s roots in North Korea, and expressed her gratitude to the U.S. for its role on the Korean Peninsula.\u201cI would most likely not be here today if not for the courageous American men and women who fought for us,\u201d she said during her address Monday, at the JoongAng Ilbo-CSIS Forum in Seoul.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'South Korea Reaffirms Defense Vows.'", "news_time": "2017-06-27 02:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thaad-not-on-chopping-block-south-korean-foreign-minister-says-1498467968", "news_title": "Thaad Not on Chopping Block, South Korean Foreign Minister Says ", "keywords": " north korea missiles, north korea threat,south korea defense, south korea diplomacy, south korea missiles, south korea-u.s. relations,Kang Kyung-wha,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,politics,domestic politics,risk news,military action,aerospace,defense,defense equipment,products,industrial goods"}, {"content": "DALIAN, China\u2014Chinese Premier       Li Keqiang       made a strong defense of his signature program aimed at bolstering the country\u2019s new economy as traditional drivers lose steam, saying the initiative has led to significant job creation.The \u201cmass entrepreneurship and innovation\u201d program, put in place in 2014 and intended to encourage individuals and businesses to\u00a0jump into\u00a0technology-oriented industries has created millions of new jobs annually in the past few years, helping the nation keep its jobless rate under 5%, Mr. Li said at the plenary session of the annual June meeting of the World Economic Forum, which started\u00a0Tuesday.The Chinese government has given priority to employment in its pursuit of inclusive growth that can benefit the public overall, Mr. Li said, adding that the program had led to \u201cunimaginable job growth.\u201dHis remarks come as concerns grow over the health of the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Burdened with high levels of debt and persistent industrial overcapacity, the country is attracting less foreign direct investment, experiencing continued capital outflows and recently had its sovereign rating downgraded by             Moody\u2019s Investors Service.       Many officials and economists within China also have been questioning whether the new-economy-oriented program led by Mr. Li could pick up the slack\u00a0or whether it would lead to more risks, especially in the area of internet finance.At the forum, Mr. Li said China has \u201csufficient capabilities\u201d to manage the risks, pointing to the country\u2019s high savings rate and Chinese banks\u2019 capital buffers. He also urged foreign investors to be \u201cbullish about China.\u201d He repeated his pledge that foreign businesses won\u2019t run into problems repatriating profits made in the country, and encouraged companies to reinvest funds in the country.Mr. Li also vowed not to resort to stimulus measures to jump-start China\u2019s economy. Instead, he said, China will continue to focus on structural changes such as cutting debt levels and reducing overcapacity to put the economy on a stronger footing in the longer term.The annual June meeting of the World Economic Forum, dubbed \u201csummer Davos,\u201d is being held in Dalian, a seaport city in northeastern China whose booming economy and glittering infrastructure represents a contrast to the foundering manufacturing facilities dotting the region.\u2014Liyan Qi contributed to this article.Write to Lingling Wei at lingling.wei@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-27 01:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-premier-touts-unimaginable-job-growth-1498541211", "news_title": "Chinese Premier Touts \u2018Unimaginable Job Growth\u2019 ", "keywords": "World Economic Forum,Li Keqiang,economic performance,indicators,employment,unemployment,economic news"}]
