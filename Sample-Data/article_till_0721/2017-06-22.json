Chief Executive       Travis Kalanick       was widely viewed by women in the industry as a rare victory for those speaking out about inequality in the workplace.For them, it was a blog post by former Uber software engineer Susan Fowler Rigetti      \ufeff      four months ago alleging sexism and harassment that sparked the sequence of events leading to Mr. Kalanick\u2019s exit on Tuesday.The allegations that Uber\u2019s workplace was hostile to women\u2014and other freewheeling practices under the leadership of Mr. Kalanick\u2014led investors to pressure him to resign, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201cThis is bigger than just Uber, and bigger than just the tech industry,\u201d said       Anita Hill,        professor of social policy, law and women\u2019s studies at Brandeis University.Ms. Hill put sexual harassment on the map as a workplace issue in 1991 when she testified that then-U.S. Supreme Court nominee       Clarence Thomas       had sexually harassed her when he was her boss.Not everyone was cheering Mr. Kalanick\u2019s exit as CEO. An internal petition circulating among Uber\u2019s staff to bring back Mr. Kalanick garnered more than 1,000 votes as of Thursday afternoon, according to an employee. The votes represent a sliver of Uber\u2019s 15,000 employees, a number Uber updated on Thursday.\u201cEmployees, we need to revolt this!\u201d urged a message, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, that linked to the digital petition. \u201cWe cannot accept investors [caving in] to the media to remove TK.\u201dThe tech industry\u2014and Silicon Valley, in particular\u2014have for years battled a reputation as being a difficult industry for women to succeed in. About two-thirds of the employees of             Facebook                   Inc.,             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google and             Apple Inc.       are men, despite their recent efforts to recruit more women.The accusations of harassment at Uber were seen by industry observers as evidence of why women struggle to fit in in the tech workplace. But Ms. Hill and others praised Uber for taking Ms. Fowler Rigetti\u2019s accusations seriously. Ms. Fowler Rigetti\u2019s blog post led to an investigation by former U.S. Attorney General       Eric Holder      that recommended an overhaul of Uber\u2019s workplace practices and the dismissal of many employees.\u201cSusan is a hero for sharing her story publicly and pushing the culture to change,\u201d said       Joelle Emerson,        chief executive of Paradigm, a consultancy that advises many Silicon Valley companies on diversity.Ms. Fowler Rigetti didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Kalanick condemned the behavior described by Ms. Fowler Rigetti in a statement following her blog post in February.Ms. Fowler Rigetti isn\u2019t the first woman to allege sexual harassment in the tech industry. In 2012,       Ellen Pao       sued her former employer, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, one of the most prominent venture-capital firms in Silicon Valley, for gender discrimination and retaliation. She lost the case, but the attention it drew sparked a dialogue about discrimination in the industry. Ms. Pao has said she regularly hears from men and women who say her allegations resonated with what they had seen or experienced.Other tech firms have settled sexual-harassment cases. In 2014, a former executive at Tinder sued the dating app and its then-parent company             IAC/InterActiveCorp,       claiming she was sexually harassed. Tinder, which denied her allegations, settled and the executive left the company.When Ms. Fowler Rigetti published her post in February, women rallied in support of her, sharing her post on social media and saying Uber permitted a toxic environment. The hashtag #DeleteUber, which encouraged users to delete the Uber app on their phones, was tweeted about 3,000 times in the 24 hours after Ms. Fowler Rigetti published her post, according to Keyhole, a social-media analytics firm.\u201cBelieving her opens up the door to believing other women who come forward with similar stories,\u201d said Y-Vonne Hutchinson, founder of ReadySet, a diversity consulting firm.Ms. Emerson said Mr. Kalanick\u2019s resignation could encourage others who are experiencing harassment and discrimination to come forward. In the months following Ms. Hill\u2019s testimony about alleged harassment, women filed a record number of harassment complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\u2014Greg BensingerWrite to Georgia Wells at Georgia.Wells@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Kalanick\u2019s Exit Called Rare Win For Women.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 22:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-ceos-resignation-hailed-as-techs-anita-hill-moment-1498123803", "news_title": "Why Uber CEO Resignation Has Women Claiming Victory", "keywords": "uber chief executive,uber culture,uber resignation,uber sexual harassment,uber travis,uber workplace culture,vc industry news,Uber Technologies,Apple,AAPL,Google,GOOGL,Alphabet,GOOG,Facebook,FB,IAC/InterActiveCorp,IAC,IACI,Joelle Emerson,Travis Kalanick,Anita Hill,Ellen Pao,Eric Holder,Susan Fowler,Susan Fowler Rigetti,corporate crime,legal action,management,management moves,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,women executives,senior level management,workplace discrimination,blogging,political,general news,society,community,crime,discrimination,harassment,human rights,civil liberties,living,lifestyle,sex discrimination,social issues,social media,women's rights,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "The branded-drug industry, which was pilloried by conservatives for supporting then-President       Barack Obama\u2019s       health-care overhaul, is playing it safe as Republicans move to undo the measure.The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade association for brand-name drug companies also known as PhRMA, has avoided taking a position on the Republican bill released\u00a0Thursday.\u201cAs this process moves forward, we will work with policymakers to ensure there is a competitive market that provides patients with access to affordable health care options and fosters the continued development of new innovative medicines,\u201d the group said in a statement.The Senate bill, unveiled on Thursday, would have an uncertain impact on drug-company business.On the one hand, it proposes eliminating a tax, which\u00a0Moody\u2019s Investors Service\u00a0estimates would cost drug companies $2.7 billion next year. But other provisions that could drop millions of people from the rolls of insured or increase their out-of-pocket expenses could hurt sales, since there would be fewer people able to afford medicines.Rolling back Medicaid coverage alone could hit drug sales. The government health-insurance program for the poor, though it gets a discount on the price of prescription medicines, is responsible for 10% of U.S. spending on drugs, according to Moody\u2019s.\u201cA significant reduction in federal Medicaid funding would negatively impact pharmaceutical volumes and prices as states seek ways to curb Medicaid spending,\u201d Moody\u2019s Senior Vice President Michael Levesque said.After passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, some Republicans in Congress lashed out at the drug industry for supporting the legislation, including paying for television ads in favor. Afterward, then-PhRMA CEO Billy Tauzin left the group.The drug industry has a number of reasons to lie low during the health-overhaul scrum, beyond the risk of antagonizing the Republicans who now control the legislative and executive branches in Washington.Criticism of the high price of many medicines has emerged as a rare source of agreement among many liberals and conservatives, and the industry has been trying to avoid giving any offense as part of efforts to fend off any punitive actions.The Biotechnology Innovation Organization, another trade association, also took a neutral stance on the Republican Senate bill.\u201cWe will continue to work with Members of Congress in both chambers and both parties to safeguard patient access and promote continued biomedical innovation,\u201d the group said in a statement.Yet the industry\u2019s larger aims of staying out of the fray doesn\u2019t mean individual officials are holding their tongues about the potential of more uninsured.Ron Cohen,        a former BIO chairman who is             Acorda Therapeutics Inc.\u2019s       chief executive, asked on Twitter: \u201cShould not \u2019making America great again\u2019 include access to #health for all our citizens?\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   The Biotechnology Innovation Organization took a neutral stance on the Republican Senate bill.

Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       and legislators said Thursday they would be willing to reconvene for a special session to resolve mayoral control, but they made no plans to do so and legislators remained uncertain they could find common ground on the issue at all.Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders typically hold a group news conference in the Capitol Red Room to mark their accomplishments when the session ends. This year Mr. Cuomo appeared alone.\u201cFor a legislature to leave with one million children returning to what we know was a failed management system is a dereliction of duty,\u201d he said.Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat, released a statement mid-Thursday promoting the bill his chamber introduced in May, which tied mayoral control to reauthorizing counties\u2019 power to raise their sales taxes, a measure important to Senate Republicans.\u201cIf the governor and/or the Senate is asking us to engage, we would be derelict in our duties not to consider those requests,\u201d Mr. Heastie said. \u201cWith that being said, there is no plan to return.\u201dA spokesman for the Senate Republicans said: \u201cWe will continue to have productive conversations with the executive and the mayor, and are confident we can reach a final agreement that extends mayoral control, but no one can say that our Senate Majority hasn\u2019t done the people\u2019s business.\u201dThe mayoral control law expires June 30. If lawmakers don\u2019t renew it, the nation\u2019s largest school district would revert to a complex and decentralized system that many called dysfunctional and rife with corruption. Some critics of mayoral control, however, say it vests too much power in one politician and parents have too little voice in their children\u2019s schools.Politicians and educators had mixed predictions on the chances lawmakers could resolve their disputes.Both the Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-controlled Assembly have introduced bills renewing mayoral control, but their versions had different strings attached. One of the Senate bills would lift the cap on the number of charter schools that could open in New York City, a condition that the Assembly has so far balked at.If mayoral control lapses, Mayor       Bill de Blasio       would lose his authority over the system for 1.1 million children and his ability to pick a chancellor who reports directly to him.The city would revert to a seven-member central board of education that would choose the chancellor. The mayor would pick two members, and each borough president would choose one.Reverting to the model before mayoral control\u2019s start 15 years ago would also mean reviving 32 community school boards, and holding elections for those posts. In the past, voter turnout was low and patronage scandals hurt the boards\u2019 reputations. In 1996, the legislature dealt a blow to their powers by taking away their ability to hire district superintendents.Supporters of mayoral control called the old system a sprawling patchwork of fiefdoms with different agendas that blocked systemic change. Shael Polakow-Suransky, a deputy chancellor under Mayor       Michael Bloomberg,        said that \u201cWhen you have to negotiate with a board, and possibly on some issues with 32 local boards, large-scale reform comes to a halt.\u201dLeonie Haimson, executive director of the advocacy group Class Size Matters, wants a new model of mayoral control that gives the City Council more clout. \u201cRight now we have no effective checks and balances on the mayor\u2019s unilateral control,\u201d she said.Mr. de Blasio said repeatedly this week that voters hold him accountable for schools, and under the old system, there was no one fully responsible for them. His office estimated that reconstituting a central Board of Education and holding local elections would cost $1.6 billion over the next decade, but skeptics have doubted that figure.\u201cEveryone in this city should be deeply concerned that the Legislature had a chance to resolve this by the end of their formal session and didn\u2019t,\u201d the mayor said Thursday on a WNYC radio interview. \u201cThings can spin out of control in Albany.\u201dMayoral control lapsed for a few weeks in the summer of 2009 but lawmakers renewed it before schools started. Mr. Polakow-Suransky, who was at the city Department of Education at that time, said that the sudden need to plan for a new central board and local elections was a huge disruption. \u201cIn this instance any interruption is a distraction and the longer it goes, the worse it gets,\u201d he said.Some educators say the hand-wringing is overwrought. David Bloomfield, a Brooklyn College professor who served as counsel to the central school board in the 1990s, said politicians are engaging in brinkmanship but it is in none of their interests to let mayoral control permanently lapse.\u201cI continue with my \u2018Keep Calm and Carry On\u2019 perspective,\u201d he said.Write to Leslie Brody at leslie.brody@wsj.com and Mike Vilensky at mike.vilensky@dowjones.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'School-Control Fight Goes On.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 21:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-lawmakers-spar-over-control-of-new-york-city-schools-1498170050", "news_title": "New York Lawmakers Spar Over Control of New York City Schools", "keywords": "albany,assembly,charter schools,elections,grammar schools,local boards,mayoral control,new york city school board,new york state legislature,public education,political,general news,education,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,school"}, {"content": "Columbia University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Nairobi, in Kenya, and Groupshot, a technology design firm, were all involved in collecting data on Nairobi\u2019s \u201cmatatu\u201d minibuses and creating a map of the system.

Afterward, Uber said it was sharpening its focus on India and Southeast Asia. But investors and analysts say the San Francisco company\u2019s worries at home may add momentum to fast-growing startups capitalizing on a home-field advantage, local knowledge and good relationships with regulators.Mr. Kalanick was critical in turning Uber into a company valued at nearly $70 billion, said investors at Beijing-based Magic Stone Alternative Investments, an Uber investor since 2015.\u201cThe business in which Uber is engaged is an all-out battle, a constant daily battle against city regulators, against taxicab unions,\u201d said       Ben Harburg,        managing partner at the firm. \u201cTravis, while he had many flaws, greatly personified this warrior ethos and was able to execute on this vision and grow the company at such a pace and such a valuation.\u201dHis departure follows hard on Uber\u2019s firing of its Asia president, Eric Alexander.Singapore-based GrabTaxi Holdings Pte., known as Grab, led Uber in all Southeast Asian markets except Singapore in cumulative downloads for the 12 months ending in May, according to data from mobile app analytics firm App Annie. Uber did win in India, slipping ahead of Bangalore-based ANI Technologies Pvt.\u2019s Ola. Ride-sharing companies typically don\u2019t disclose rides per day.\u201cUber is losing the race in Asia,\u201d said       Rushabh Doshi,        a Singapore-based analyst at researcher Canalys. \u201cIn the two largest markets here, India and Indonesia, Uber is under serious attack by Ola and Grab, respectively.\u201dIn addition to having local connections, Asia\u2019s ride-sharing companies are more agile, can adapt quickly to domestic rules and are ensuring better service to keep driver retention high, he said.An Uber spokesman declined to say whether its strategy may change in the region following Mr. Kalanick\u2019s departure.In India, where the rise of the cheap smartphone is creating millions of potential new customers, Uber has said it is investing more than $1 billion\u2014boosting its mapping capabilities, hiring more engineers and training new drivers. But Ola, valued at $5 billion and backed by investors including Japan\u2019s             SoftBank Group Corp.      , operates in more cities and says it has more drivers, offering features like auto-rickshaw rides. An Ola spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Kalanick\u2019s departure.A woman who in 2014 was raped by an Uber driver in India is suing the company in the U.S., saying Mr. Kalanick, Mr. Alexander and another top deputy who also left the company breached her privacy by obtaining and publicizing her medical records.In a statement, an Uber spokesman said: \u201cNo one should have to go through a horrific experience like this, and we\u2019re truly sorry that she\u2019s had to relive it over the last few weeks.\u201d Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Alexander didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.Southeast Asia, home to more than 600 million people, is another key battleground.While Uber has tangled with regulators and taxi unions globally, Grab has said it works closely with authorities and even has partnerships with local taxi companies. It has recently expanded to offer mobile payments. Grab is valued at $3 billion and is also backed by SoftBank, among others.\u201cWe\u2019re well-positioned to win,\u201d a spokeswoman said, though she declined to comment on Mr. Kalanick.Another major rival in Southeast Asia is Indonesia\u2019s Go-Jek, a fast-growing motorcycle-hailing startup backed by             KKR,       Warburg Pincus LLC and others. The company launched its app in 2015 and has expanded to provide food and package delivery, on-demand beauty and cleaning services and more. A Go-Jek spokesman declined to comment.Uber\u2019s management troubles at home could help Grab and Go-Jek woo drivers and users, said       Vishal Harnal,        a Singapore-based Partner at venture-capital firm 500 Startups, a Grab investor.\u201cGrab and Go-Jek are going to be able to do a lot more while Uber has other fires to fight,\u201d he said.Write to Newley Purnell at newley.purnell @wsj.com, Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com and Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Asia Startups Rush to Seize on Uber\u2019s Setbacks.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 21:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kalanick-resignation-just-the-latest-detour-for-uber-in-asia-1498136471", "news_title": "CEO\u2019s Resignation Is the Least of Uber\u2019s Problems in Asia ", "keywords": "apps,ride-hailing,ride-hailing apps,ride-sharing,uber in asia,uber in china,uber in india,uber in southeast asia,vc analysis,Uber Technologies,Didi Chuxing Technology,GrabTaxi Holdings,ANI Technologies,PT Go-Jek Indonesia,Travis Kalanick,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,management,management moves,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "New YorkLike all great parables,       George Orwell\u2019s       \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d long ago cast off from the dock of its original intent and set sail on the sea of ambiguity. When Orwell published the book in 1948, he meant for it to be read as a plausible nightmare, a cautionary portrait of (in his words) \u201cwhat communism would be like if it were firmly rooted in the English-speaking countries, and was no longer a mere extension of the Russian Foreign Office.\u201d But a quarter-century after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, anyone who now puts the novel on the stage or screen is more likely to have a different tale to tell, and a different reason for telling it.1984Hudson Theatre 139-141 W. 44th St.  $35-$149, 212-239-6200/800-432-7250Enter       Robert Icke       and       Duncan Macmillan,        whose freely adapted 2014 stage version of \u201c1984\u201d has just transferred to Broadway from London\u2019s West End. Messrs. Icke and Macmillan, who double as the show\u2019s directors, have updated the tale of Winston Smith (played by       Tom Sturridge      ) by using a huge video screen suspended over the stage to portray the modern digital technology with which Big Brother and his henchmen spy on the hapless Winston and his fellow citizens. The idea, I assume, is to make \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d more immediately relevant to our latter-day age of digital post-privacy.We may also safely assume, however, that those responsible for bringing \u201c1984\u201d to Broadway were well aware of the fact that Orwell\u2019s novel shot to the top of the U.S. best-seller lists in the immediate wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election to the presidency. Lest we forget, Winston Smith worked in the Ministry of Truth, Orwell\u2019s fictional purveyors of \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201calternative facts\u201d avant la lettre, which explains the sudden explosion of interest in the book. But while theater in America lately seems to be aspiring to the condition of All Trump, All the Time, no attempt has been made to shoehorn boo-hiss-stone-him-to-death references to the president into this play or its production. What we have here, instead, is a multimedia extravaganza \u00e0 la \u201cThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,\u201d one whose moral, insofar as I can tease it out, is that Big Brother is watching us right this second.Whatever else that is, it isn\u2019t stop-press news, and it doesn\u2019t help that \u201c1984\u201d is framed by a pair of coyly postmodern scenes in which a gaggle of sober-sided scholars tries to figure out whether Winston\u2019s diary is fact or fiction. If you\u2019re not familiar with the novel going in, you\u2019re likely to find these scenes confusing, and even if you know it well, I doubt you\u2019ll find them dramatically compelling.The rest of \u201c1984,\u201d however, is broadly faithful to the novel, with Orwell\u2019s moral\u2014that the unforgivable sin of totalitarianism is to erase the past and make all truth relative\u2014left wholly intact. The continuing applicability of this moral to current events makes it regrettable that \u201c1984\u201d isn\u2019t more theatrically potent than it turns out to be. Some scenes, the Two Minutes Hate in particular, do have tremendous punch, perhaps because they are near-literal visualizations of Orwell\u2019s text. It helps, too, that       Tom Gibbons\u2019s       sound design and       Natasha Chivers\u2019s       lighting are so fine, and two of the performances are equally noteworthy:       Olivia Wilde       is passionate and immediate as Julia, Winston\u2019s lover, while       Reed Birney       plays O\u2019Brien, his torturer, not as a Snidely Whiplash-type villain but as a bland bureaucrat, an interpretation all the more effective for its understatement.Mr. Sturridge isn\u2019t as memorable as his colleagues, though one aspect of his performance stands out, which is that he plays Winston in an unambiguously contemporary dude-where\u2019s-my-freedom manner (think Keanu Reeves). This helps to place \u201c1984\u201d more specifically in the present, something that the rest of the production largely fails to do. To be sure, lip service has been paid to giving us an up-to-the-minute \u201c1984,\u201d most notably in a newly written line spoken by O\u2019Brien: \u201cThe people are not going to revolt. They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice what\u2019s really happening.\u201d For the most part, though, this \u201c1984\u201d floats free of historical specificity, just as the violence of the climactic torture scene is strangely lacking in visceral impact.The Icke-Macmillan \u201c1984\u201d would hit home harder were it set not in a sort-of-nowish not-quite-London but in, say, Pyongyang\u2014or on an American college campus.

Hence, the shock when the French ad giant             Publicis Groupe        PUBGY 0.55%       said it would be taking a hiatus from the festivities next year and channeling the savings to build an artificial intelligence platform.The decision has been met with scorn from many Publicis employees and rival ad companies, who view the event\u2014and the awards\u2014as an important validation of their craft and achievements. It has also reignited broader conversations about the relationship between creativity, data and technology in the advertising business.In the past few years some executives have expressed concern that a business that was built around creativity\u2014with heroes like Dan Wieden and Lee Clow\u2014has become overly enamored with data and technology. Some on Madison Avenue have bemoaned the fact that the creative core of the business is being neglected as the focus moves toward science rather than art.\u201cI am stunned\u201d by the Publicis decision, said       Joe Tripodi,        global chief marketing officer of the Subway fast-food chain. \u201cThis undermines the business of brand building.\u201d He said creativity \u201cdrives sales\u201d and it \u201cneeds to be recognized.\u201dCarter Murray, chief executive of Interpublic Group-owned agency network FCB, said in a statement: \u201cWe are a creative agency....Technology inspires us and fuels our creativity but we are NOT a technology company.\u201dThe Cannes festival, known as the Oscars of Advertising, for decades was an annual pilgrimage for the elite of the ad industry to applaud the best creative ideas of the year and pay homage to the superstars of the business.It has evolved and its attendees now include legions of digital ad giants, ad technology firms and more recently consultancy companies, who have expensive yachts and throw extravagant parties featuring A-list celebrities, hoping to catch the attention of marketers.To some critics in the industry, the extravagance can look tone-deaf when the industry is going through trying times, with clients cutting costs and demanding more transparency.The Cannes decision was one of the first big moves by Publicis\u2019 new CEO,       Arthur Sadoun,        who is under pressure to revitalize Publicis after it lost a batch of big accounts and recently reported a drop in revenue.A Publicis spokeswoman said the company \u201cdidn\u2019t take this decision lightly\u201d and noted the priority is to build the artificial intelligence platform, Marcel. \u201cTo build this extremely powerful tool, which will allow all of our people to fuel their best creative work, we need to focus 100% on making it a reality over the next 12 months,\u201d she said.According to someone close to the project, the Marcel initiative is expected to cost tens of millions of dollars and is meant to make it easy to crowdsource creative work within the company and assign people to various projects around the globe.Staffers at Publicis\u2019 agencies, which include iconic creative shops like Leo Burnett, creators of the Marlboro Man and Tony the Tiger, and Saatchi & Saatchi, have voiced their concerns at cocktail parties in Cannes and on social media, noting how awards can impact their career prospects.\u201cOur compensation and our ability to get new jobs is tied directly to the awards and recognition we\u2019re given,\u201d read one Reddit post from a user who claimed to be a Publicis staffer.Several Publicis clients have told executives at the company that they think the decision was a bad idea because it could remove the incentive for agency staffers to strive to create the best work, according to a person familiar with the matter.In an internal memo sent to Publicis staffers that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Sadoun wrote that clients\u2019 \u201cearly feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.\u201d The memo was entitled, \u201cCutting through the noise.\u201dMr. Sadoun said in the memo he will be on Twitter starting Monday to answer any questions employees might have. \u201cBe as candid as possible; use a pseudonym, use a friend\u2019s account, or get in touch personally,\u201d he wrote.Publicis provided a statement it said was from       Dermot Boden,        chief brand officer of Citi: \u201cAs a client, I think it is good to see our agency partner engage in [a] bold move.\u201d Mr. Boden couldn\u2019t be reached to confirm the statement.Executives from rival agencies have questioned the move. A senior executive at U.S. ad titan             Omnicom Group Inc.       said the decision was shortsighted, because awards are a form of validation in the eyes of clients.\u201cAwards aren\u2019t going to win business directly but they do help build confidence in an agency, and that\u2019s important\u201d, he said.WPP                   chief executive       Martin Sorrell       said Wednesday he thought the Publicis decision would \u201cdisenchant\u201d staffers in creative departments at Publicis agencies.Nevertheless, Mr. Sorrell said his company is also considering whether to continue attending the festival, after having halved WPP\u2019s contingent this year to 500 people.\u201cGiven what\u2019s going on in the industry, and politically and socially, I just think some of it is inappropriate,\u201c Mr. Sorrell said. \u201dThis has become too brash, too spectacular.\u201d\u2014Suzanne Vranica contributed to this articleWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com and Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 20:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/revenge-of-the-creatives-backlash-over-ad-giants-withdrawal-from-cannes-festival-1498177644", "news_title": "Revenge of the Creatives: Backlash Over Ad Giant\u2019s Withdrawal from Cannes Festival", "keywords": "advertising,agency,cannescmo,cannes festival,festival of creativity,french riviera,marketing,Publicis Groupe,PUB.FR,markets,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,festivals,public relations,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "Investors think       Jeff Bezos       has the magic touch. Few companies other than             Amazon.com Inc.       could announce a nearly $14 billion takeover of a mature firm, give no details of why they are buying the very business model they\u2019re trying to disrupt, and have their market value rise by more than the takeover price.Since Amazon said last week that it would buy upscale grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc., multiple theories have circulated about what it is up to. Some think it is about convenience shopping. Some that it is about customer data. Some suggest logistics, the grocery supply chain, or an extra distribution channel for the company\u2019s growing range of own-brand electronics. Still others think Amazon hasn\u2019t really got a strategy yet. What all seem to agree on is that Amazon will make it work, and other grocers should be cowering in the their freezer cases.Amazon doesn\u2019t inspire the near-religious fervor found among Apple\u2019s true believers, but the online-shopping-to-movie-studio conglomerate does depend on faith, hope and charity. Faith in Mr. Bezos\u2019s inventiveness provides the essential underpinning for Amazon shares, while investors hope that he doesn\u2019t really think of the company as a charity to finance wacky new ideas.Amazon\u2014like Google and             Facebook                  \u2014has a successful core business, pays little heed to shareholders and plows its spare cash back into expansion and research and development rather than dividends. In the 20 years since it listed, it has made a total of $5.7 billion in net income, more than half of that in the past two years. It has spent $64 billion on R&D in the same period, including $4.8 billion in the first quarter alone.Mr. Bezos set out his principles in 1997. \u201cWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions,\u201d he told shareholders.Investors have bought in to the idea that by not maximizing profit in the short term, Amazon can maximize profit in the long term\u2014even if, 20 years later, the long term still hasn\u2019t arrived. At most listed companies, the exact opposite is true, with management under constant pressure to boost dividends and buybacks.\u201cIt\u2019s become easier to invest as a private company than as a public company,\u201d says       James Anderson,        a partner at Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford & Co., whose biggest holding is Amazon. \u201cThere\u2019s a small number of companies that appears permitted to do this, and it\u2019s very difficult for most other public companies.\u201dHolding shares in Amazon requires the belief that Mr. Bezos will find enough good investments to offset the mistakes\u2014such as cash Amazon put into Pets.com, the epitome of badly-thought-through dot-com bubble catastrophes. So far, just one of his successes would cover a lot of mistakes, with Amazon Web Services alone making almost 90% of operating profit in the first quarter.Investors also need to believe that eventually Mr. Bezos will start paying out some of the cash. The value of a company ultimately comes from future dividends\u2014and Amazon has yet to pay a cent.The long-term danger is that instead of paying dividends, the cash is wasted. History is littered with examples of chief executives indulged by shareholders who become so enamored of their own brilliance that they fritter away shareholder money on wasteful expansion.So far, the founders of the big tech stocks have mostly made good decisions, and while they aren\u2019t exactly humble, hubris isn\u2019t apparent either. But their secrecy\u2014on display again with the lack of explanation of the Whole Foods deal\u2014shows a degree of contempt for investors.The short-term danger doesn\u2019t involve Amazon, but its shareholders. Investors seem to have suspended disbelief. However brilliant Mr. Bezos is, it is extraordinary that he is able to launch a big takeover without offering any strategic or financial rationale. The same glass-half-full attitude was behind shareholder acceptance of nonvoting shares in             Snap Inc.\u2019s       initial public offering. When doubt returns, as it always does, Amazon shares will suffer.In many ways, Amazon is an exemplar for investors. In most companies, shareholders should encourage more R&D spending, worry less about quarterly targets and tell managers to focus on the business, not the share price. In Amazon\u2019s case, the willingness to accept no explanation at all for a $13.7 billion purchase suggests faith has run too far.Write to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Blind Faith in Bezos May Sting Investors.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 20:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/where-bezos-leads-amazon-shareholders-blindly-follow-1498147966", "news_title": "Where Bezos Leads, Amazon Shareholders Blindly Follow", "keywords": "amazon, takeover, whole foods,Whole Foods Market,WFM,Amazon,Amazon.com,AMZN,Jeff Bezos,James Anderson,financial performance,earnings,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,retail,wholesale,food retailing,specialty stores,e-commerce,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "Health-care shares jumped Thursday in an otherwise muted session for U.S. stocks.The best-performing sector in the S&P 500 this week extended its gains after Senate Republicans unveiled their plans to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index posted its highest close since January 2016.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.74 points, or less than 0.1%, to 21397.29.

Instead the revolt has come from within his family.The feud is ostensibly about Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s house, which according to his will should be demolished. On June 16       Lee Hsien Yang       and       Lee Wei Ling,        the younger son and daughter of the late leader, posted a statement on             Facebook                   accusing their brother of planning to designate the house as a historical building. The Cabinet Secretary confirmed that a ministerial committee is considering whether to preserve it.But the real fight is over Singapore\u2019s political system. The younger Lees accused the Prime Minister of abusing his power: \u201c[W]e have felt threatened by Hsien Loong\u2019s misuse of his position and influence over the Singapore government and its agencies to drive his agenda. We are concerned that the system has few checks and balances to prevent the abuse of government.\u201d Lee Hsien Yang, the former CEO of Singapore\u2019s largest listed company, said he will leave Singapore because he fears retaliation.Most shocking, the two younger Lees accuse their brother and his wife,       Ho Ching,        of nepotism: \u201cHis political power is drawn from his being Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s son. We have observed that Hsien Loong and Ho Ching want to milk Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s legacy for their own political purposes. We also believe, based on our interactions, that they harbour political ambitions for their son,       Li Hongyi.      \u201dThe Prime Minister responded, \u201cHo Ching and I deny these allegations, especially the absurd claim that I have political ambitions for my son.\u201dSingapore under Lee Kuan Yew prided itself on clean government and meritocracy, but another part of his legacy was the suppression of criticism. When publications and opposition politicians expressed concerns similar to those now being raised, the government found ways to silence them. The government also used the Internal Security Act to detain those it deemed subversive without trial.Lee Kuan Yew held Singapore\u2019s elite together through a web of personal connections and prestige, and the PAP\u2019s rule has never been seriously challenged. The squabbling among his children reveals cracks in this consensus, and the big question is whether this will result in serious political opposition.

So much that this week he was willing to give up mayoral control of the city\u2019s schools rather than allow an increase in the cap on the number of charter schools.The state legislature gave mayoral control to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor,       Michael Bloomberg,        as a way to wrest school governance from the union-dominated school board. Mr. Bloomberg used it to good effect by expanding innovation and choice, including charter schools. Mayoral control lets voters hold a political leader accountable for the city\u2019s education performance.But Mr. de Blasio is a wholly owned subsidiary of the teachers union, so he has used mayoral control to erect barriers to charters at every opportunity. This includes denying them space that isn\u2019t being used in other public schools. His hostility reached new heights on Wednesday when he let state legislators adjourn for their legislative session without renewing his authority rather than work out a deal that would allow more charters.Charter schools already educate nearly one-tenth of New York City\u2019s one million schoolchildren, and they include such stars as Success Academy that recently received the Broad Prize for the performance of its 14,000 students. The unions resent charters because they aren\u2019t union-run\u2014and thus throw off no union dues\u2014and because their success proves that kids written off as unteachable can learn in the right environment.In state test scores for 2015-16, for example, African-American and Hispanic charter students were more than twice as likely to be proficient in math than their peers in traditional public schools. Parents can see the results, which is why there is a waiting list of nearly 50,000 students to attend city charters.The good news is that charters have allies in Albany who have kept a short leash on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s control, extending it for one year in both 2015 and 2016. This year the GOP state Senate offered Mr. de Blasio control for as much as five years and proposed allowing 40% of the charter-school openings to be in New York City, as well as raising the state cap on charters to 510 from the current 460. Governor       Andrew Cuomo       has also battled Mr. de Blasio over charters and favors an increase in the charter cap.As a candidate three years ago, Mr. de Blasio acknowledged the failures of public education in New York and declared that he\u2019d be mayor for all children\u2014those in \u201ctraditional public schools, in charter schools, in religious schools.\u201d But now as he gears up for his January re-election campaign, he is doing the bidding of unions run by adults who fear nothing more than schools that might better educate students.

The results signal that many banks could win the Fed\u2019s approval to increase dividend payouts to investors next week, in the second round of the tests.The outcome gives ammunition to the Trump administration and congressional Republicans who see some of the rules put in place after the financial crisis as excessive and want to ease them in the name of boosting economic growth. Supporters of the rules say healthy banks show the regulations are working, not that they need to be rolled back.\u201cAnticipation of some form of Trump-led deregulation could not be any higher,\u201d       William Hines,        an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, wrote in an email Thursday. \u201cThe banks themselves are lobbying hard for it, and a clear bill of health from the stress tests will help their cause. But it is anything but a foregone conclusion.\u201dThe exams are one of several new drills that banks must run in the name of preventing a repeat of the 2008 crisis and subsequent federal bailouts, from liquidity rules preventing a short-term cash crunch to \u201cliving will\u201d bankruptcy plans.This year\u2019s results come in the midst of a broad rethink of those rules. Last week, the Treasury Department released a banking policy report that recommended the Fed consider changes to the stress tests.The Treasury report said no firm, even the largest, should have its capital plans rejected for solely \u201cqualitative\u201d reasons. Fed officials are already considering that change. In the second round of the tests, scheduled to be released next week, the Fed typically judges banks\u2019 \u201cqualitative\u201d risk-management practices.The report also said the tests should occur only once every two years, instead of annually, except \u201cin the case of extraordinary events.\u201d It said the Fed should solicit public input on the tests, including the hypothetical scenarios and mathematical models.Fed officials have resisted similar recommendations in the past when they were suggested by bankers, saying they would undermine the exams by making them less flexible. Fed governor       Jerome Powell,        the Fed\u2019s regulatory point man, said in Senate testimony Thursday that the Fed would solicit public input on how to make the tests more transparent.Mr. Powell said he believes it would be appropriate to exempt \u201cfirms that achieve and sustain high-quality capital planning capabilities\u201d from the qualitative part of the exams, meaning the largest U.S. banks could win that exemption in future years.He also said the Fed is open to other rule changes, but not a reduction in risk-based capital requirements. \u201cI don\u2019t think what we\u2019re talking about here amounts to\u2026broad deregulation,\u201d Mr. Powell told the Senate Banking Committee. \u201cI think it amounts to making regulation more efficient.\u201dAny broad rollback of rules would take time. The Trump administration has few officials in place at the banking regulators. And efforts to change regulations in Congress must overcome potential opposition from Senate Democrats.Sen. Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said Thursday that policy makers could undo important consumer protections if they push to deregulate too far. \u201cThere is no evidence that relaxing rules will lead banks to lend more,\u201d Mr. Brown said at Thursday\u2019s hearing.It was the third straight year the initial results showed all big banks meeting the Fed\u2019s definition of good health. A Fed official said big banks finished the hypothetical downturn with an even higher level of capital than they had before the 2008 crisis began.The more closely watched part of the annual tests occurs next Wednesday, when the Fed will release its decision whether to approve, or block, banks\u2019 plans to return capital to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks. The positive results may also allow banks to make larger payouts than in past years.This week\u2019s results don\u2019t necessarily predict the Fed\u2019s verdict next week. In some previous years, banks have shown strong capital ratios in the first part of the tests, only to be deemed as failing in the second round, which uses a broader set of criteria. Thursday\u2019s results don\u2019t include banks\u2019 individual capital-distribution plans.The Fed said the banks would experience collective loan losses of about $383 billion but still meet its required minimum capital ratios, even in a hypothetical scenario that envisions the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubling to 10% and severe strains in corporate-loan and commercial real-estate markets.Fed officials attributed the positive results to the fact that banks have worked through problematic loans like soured mortgages, while steadily increasing loss-absorbing capital on their books as a result of stiffer postcrisis requirements.Fewer banks are expected to come up short in the second round of tests next week than in previous years. This year, only 13 of the largest, most complex banks will have to take the qualitative exam. Fed officials say that reflects its conclusion that, broadly, banks have improved their ability to track risks in real time.The stress tests were first conducted in 2009 to help convince investors that the banking system wasn\u2019t about to collapse. They are now a legal requirement to force banks to think about the possibility of an unexpected crisis.The Fed said the 34 banks collectively maintained at least 9.2% high-quality capital as a share of assets on one measurement, staying well above the Fed\u2019s 4.5% minimum even after being pounded by a severe economic downturn. The Fed changes the details of its recession scenarios from year to year.Credit cards were one trouble spot for banks, with loan losses rising 9% from last year\u2019s test to $100 billion. U.S. card performance has recently been weakening at several lenders, driven in part by an increase in subprime borrowing. Fed officials said they were finding higher delinquency rates in bank card portfolios at the same time that card lending was increasing.A new bar for banks to clear in this year\u2019s test was the supplementary leverage ratio, which applied to the largest and most complex banks. That measure, which comes into effect in 2018, is meant to indicate whether banks also hold sufficient capital to cover their off-balance-sheet exposures. That includes derivatives contracts, a big cause of the panic of 2008. A handful of banks, including             Morgan Stanley                   and             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,       fell within a couple percentage points of the minimum for that ratio during the Fed\u2019s hypothetical scenario. That could end up limiting their shareholder payouts.In addition to Thursday\u2019s public results, banks also learned privately whether their individual plans to return capital to shareholders would push them below the Fed\u2019s minimum required threshold. If that happens, they may take a one-time shot at cutting their request for dividends or buybacks to stay above the Fed\u2019s minimum requirement.Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com and Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Fed Tests Buoy Case For Easing Bank Rules.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 19:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-stress-tests-biggest-u-s-banks-declared-healthy-1498163432", "news_title": "Fed\u2019s Stress Tests Bolster Case for Easing Bank Rules", "keywords": "Cowen,COWN,Morgan Stanley,MS,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,Jaret Seiberg,Jerome Powell,William Hines,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,deregulation,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Government-owned Qatar Airways said it aims to buy a significant stake in American Airlines Group Inc.\u2014a brash attempt by the fast-growing Middle East carrier to push into the U.S. amid political upheaval back home.In a filing early Thursday, American said Qatar Airways Chief Executive       Akbar Al Baker       told it of its plan to acquire up to a 10% stake. American said Qatar Airways informed it of its intention to buy at least $808 million of its stock on the open market, or roughly 16.7 million shares at Wednesday\u2019s closing price.American Chief Executive       Doug Parker,        in an interview Thursday, he was \u201cnot happy\u201d about the prospect and found the approach \u201cpuzzling and strange.\u201dAmerican, the world\u2019s largest airline by traffic and revenue, has a market value of roughly $24 billion. American said Qatar Airways approached it in early June about the investment.American Airlines shares finished up 54 cents, or 1.1%, at $48.97.Qatar Airways, in a separate statement, said it would seek to build a 4.75% stake initially\u2014the maximum allowed without American board approval\u2014then add to it after winning consent from American Airlines directors and U.S. regulators. It said it sees American as a \u201cstrong investment opportunity\u201d and intends its investment to be a \u201cpassive position.\u201dForeign ownership stakes in U.S. airlines are relatively rare but not unprecedented. U.S. law allows foreigners to hold up to 25% of voting shares and 49% economic interest in a U.S airline. British Airways once held a 25% stake in US Airways. British entrepreneur       Richard Branson       owned a large minority stake in Virgin America Inc.Qatar\u2019s proposed investment in American would be more unusual: The two have been on opposite sides of a bitter air-industry fight. Some U.S. and European carriers have accused Qatar Airways and two other Gulf airlines, Emirates Airline and Etihad Airways, of benefiting from government ownership and subsidies. The fast-growing Gulf carriers have denied that.At the same time, Qatar is in the middle of a regional dust-up with Persian Gulf neighbors including Saudi Arabia, who have accused Qatar of supporting Islamist groups and extremists in the region. Qatar has denied those accusations.President       Donald Trump      seemed to support the claim in a tweet, after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt enacted an economic embargo on Qatar in early June. Since then, the State Department has walked back, insisting that Saudi Arabia, a staunch U.S. ally, and others provide evidence for their charges. Qatar is also a key Washington ally and hosts one of the biggest overseas U.S. military bases.A number of U.S. agencies will review any transaction. American said Qatar has already submitted its plans to U.S. antitrust regulators, which would include the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Justice Department.Qatar can\u2019t buy more than $81 million in American stock without a green light from U.S. authorities under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Still, there isn\u2019t a recent track record of government antitrust enforcers challenging acquisitions at the size of 10%. A deal would be unlikely to raise major red flags about competition, especially if Qatar Airways isn\u2019t seeking to obtain additional rights, such as board seats.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. could also weigh in. CFIUS is a secretive, multi-agency body led by the Treasury Department that can recommend the president block foreign deals on national security grounds.American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, said it hadn\u2019t sought the investment and the proposed move wouldn\u2019t affect its management or strategic direction. American said the investment wouldn\u2019t stop it from pursuing its subsidy claim against the Persian Gulf carriers.On the surface, the move echoes Qatar Airways\u2019 investment in the parent of             British Airways,       International Consolidated Airlines Group SA. In 2015, Qatar Airways initially acquired 9.9% in IAG, then raised its stake to about 20% in several share purchases. While it hasn\u2019t interfered with running the airline or taken a board seat, cooperation between Qatar Airways and             British Airways                   has blossomed.Qatar Airways is one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing air carriers. Mr. Al Baker has raised Qatar Airways\u2019 profile with sponsorship deals, including with soccer club FC Barcelona and the 2018 and 2022 soccer World Cups. It prides itself on lavishing amenities on passengers, and for its position in the elite club of 5-star-rated airlines, the top level in the Skytrax ranking system.Qatar Airways has taken stakes in other airlines including South America\u2019s LATAM Airlines Group. It also is taking a stake in Italy\u2019s Meridiana and has said it wanted to set up a carrier in India.\u201cIt\u2019s a strategic investment\u201d in the U.S. market, said Daniel McKenzie, an analyst at Buckingham Research Group. The U.S. is Qatar\u2019s top destination and accounts for 8% of its total flying, he said.The disclosure comes as the nation of Qatar is coping with the economic embargo levied in early June by Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Bahrain and Egypt. Mr. Al Baker criticized Mr. Trump for seeming to take sides in the dispute.The blockade has hit Qatar Airways especially hard. It relies heavily on Persian Gulf passengers traveling through its hub in Doha, Qatar. After the imposition of the blockade, Mr. Al Baker said traffic would suffer but he saw it as an opportunity to push growth in other markets,including the U.S.The move on American Airlines could have broader strategic benefits for the tiny Persian Gulf state amid the standoff. It has long aligned itself against its much bigger neighbor, Saudi Arabia, in many of the region\u2019s economic, political and military conflicts. But it has balanced that with an outsize global diplomacy role, advertising itself to the U.S. and others as an honest broker in some regional crises. It also hosts the U.S. military at the sprawling Al Udeid Air Base, outside Doha, home to the biggest U.S. military presence in the region.Amid Qatar\u2019s worsening tensions with Saudi Arabia, a big investment in the U.S. could help solidify its alliance with the U.S., said Hunter Keay, an analyst at Wolfe Research. Shortly after the blockade went into effect, Qatar agreed to buy about $12 billion of combat planes from Boeing Co.A minority stake in American \u201cintertwines Qatar with U.S. interests a bit more,\u201d Mr. Keay said.The investment could drive a wedge between Qatar and its other big Persian Gulf antagonist, the U.A.E. So far, Qatar Airways has moved in lockstep with two big carriers based in the U.A.E., Emirates Airline and Etihad Airways, in the tussle over subsidies.American\u2019s Mr. Parker said Mr. Al Baker approached him at an airline industry meeting in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, that was held between June 4 and June 6. Saudi Arabia and its allies unveiled its blockade on Qatar on June 5. Mr. Parker called the meeting a \u201cshort, private conversation.\u201dAmerican Airlines, as of April filings, had five shareholders above the 4.75% threshold, including Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which has a 10% stake. American has had a run of strong profits in recent years and successfully managed its 2013 merger with US Airways Group Inc. Mr. Buffett recently rewarded the U.S. industry\u2019s improving fortunes, also taking stakes in             Delta Airlines Inc.,       United Continental Holdings and Southwest Holdings Co.American\u2019s pilots and flight attendants unions expressed opposition to Qatar Airways taking a stake, and labor groups have joined the calls for the U.S. to re-examine aviation trade deals with Gulf nations because of the dispute over alleged subsidies.Mr. Parker said he is \u201calways excited to hear that people believe American is a great investment.\u201d But the proposed investment \u201cis confusing to our team and we don\u2019t like that,\u201d he said.\u2014Brent Kendall and Kate O\u2019Keeffe in Washington, D.C. contributed to this article.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com, Susan Carey at susan.carey@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Qatar Seeks Stake in American Airlines.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 19:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-airways-seeks-a-10-stake-in-american-airlines-1498134680", "news_title": "American Airlines CEO \u2018Not Happy\u2019 About Qatar Airways Plan to Buy 10% Stake", "keywords": "american airlines qatar,high yield,qatar airways ownership,qatar airways stake in american,qatar buys stake in american airlines,who owns american airlines,American Airlines Group,AAL,Qatar Airways,United Continental Holdings,UAL,Delta Air Lines,DAL,Berkshire Hathaway,BRK.B,International Consolidated Airlines Group,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,management,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,rental,leasing services,air transport,business,consumer services,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture suspended imports of fresh beef from Brazil, citing recurring safety concerns.The USDA\u2019s move came after Brazil earlier Thursday suspended beef exports from five slaughterhouses to the U.S., after a foot-and-mouth disease vaccine potentially caused abscesses in some cattle, according to the national meat-exporting group Abiec.\u201cAlthough international trade is an important part of what we do at USDA, and Brazil has long been one of our partners, my first priority is to protect American consumers,\u201d said USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue, announcing the suspension Thursday afternoon. The USDA said the block on Brazilian beef would remain in place until Brazil\u2019s agricultural ministry \u201ctakes corrective action which the USDA finds satisfactory.\u201dThe USDA said its Food Safety and Inspection Service has been scrutinizing all Brazilian meat shipments to the U.S. since March, when Brazilian authorities announced a corruption probe into the country\u2019s food sanitation inspection system. Since then, USDA officials have rejected about 11% of Brazilian fresh beef products\u2014a rate the agency said was far above the 1% rejected from other fresh beef exporting nations. About 1.9 million pounds of Brazilian beef were turned away due to public health concerns, sanitary conditions, and animal health issues since then.Brazil\u2019s agriculture ministry said the Brazilian cattle\u2019s reaction to the vaccine poses no health risks, and exports from the five abattoirs were suspended to give their owners time to provide information to authorities and take measures to correct the situation.Marfrig Global Foods,        MRRTY 0.47%       owner of three of the five slaughterhouses, said in a statement that it has a rigorous quality control system and is taking the measures necessary to resume exports from those plants to the U.S.The USDA said its move supersedes Brazil\u2019s self-imposed suspension of the five plants. A spokesman for Abiec had no immediate comment on the U.S. suspension.The U.S. is among the world\u2019s largest meat producing nations and imports relatively little from Brazil.In 2016 the USDA agreed to allow fresh beef imports from Brazil, and about 37,000 metric tons of Brazilian fresh beef were imported last year, compared with 11.7 million metric tons consumed in the U.S. overall for 2016, according to USDA data. Brazil\u2019s meat sales to the U.S. have more than tripled over the last five years, but still are below the levels of most of the preceding decade. Typically the U.S. imports no chicken from Brazil and only negligible amounts of pork.The National Farmers Union, a Washington-based trade group for U.S. farmers, supported the USDA\u2019s move and called for rules requiring meat sold in the U.S. to bear labels telling consumers where it was produced.Write to Jacob Bunge at jacob.bunge@wsj.com and Jeffrey T.

The binary choice now is between pushing past the media and Democratic flak to pass a historic achievement, or wilting under the pressure and ratifying the ObamaCare status quo.The bill is an imperfect compromise between moderate and conservative Republicans, and it makes pains to accommodate different interests and the Americans, states and businesses that have adapted to ObamaCare over the years. The center-right nature of the details means the Senate won\u2019t be ushering in some free-market utopia. But the reform is a major improvement over the U.S. health-care status quo that will worsen if the bill fails.The Senate bill works off the American Health Care Act that the House passed in May. Like the House, the legislation replaces ObamaCare\u2019s subsidies with tax credits for people who buy insurance on the individual market, ends Medicaid\u2019s status as an open-ended entitlement, and starts to resolve some of the health-care system\u2019s abiding flaws.Medicaid was most divisive for Republicans in their months-long internal debate, so the pleasant surprise is that the Senate\u2019s entitlement overhaul is somewhat stronger than the House\u2019s. The program originally meant for poor women, children and the disabled\u2014which ObamaCare opened to able-bodied, working-age adults above the poverty level\u2014would be modernized for the first time. This could become the most consequential social reform since the welfare reconstruction of 1996.Like the House, the Senate would end the funding formula that rewards states for spending more and transition to block grants, allocated on per capita enrollment. Governors would receive far more regulatory flexibility to manage their programs. Under the final House bill, the grants would max out at the rate of inflation plus one percentage point, starting in 2020.The Senate waits four years instead of three but pegs the grants to inflation with no adjuster. The danger of delay is that grants become another phony rule like the old Medicare \u201cdoc fix\u201d that Congress refused to enforce. But the Senate\u2019s structural changes are more ambitious, and the benefits of those revisions will compound over time.The Senate also ends ObamaCare\u2019s discrimination between old and new enrollees, which liberals caricature as \u201crolling back\u201d the Medicaid expansion. The government now pays the whole cost for the expansion population, to encourage Governors to join, but states are only compensated at a national-average 52% match rate for traditional beneficiaries like poor kids. Funding everyone equally\u2014starting in 2021\u2014will cause Governors to find efficiencies and retarget care to the most vulnerable.As for the failing ObamaCare insurance exchanges\u2014Anthem quit Wisconsin and Indiana on Wednesday\u2014the Senate would provide tax credits for use in a somewhat deregulated individual market. Rather than mandates to force Americans to buy coverage, which don\u2019t work in any case, the bill uses incentives to lure consumers and insurers back with patient-centered coverage that is more affordable and better meets individual needs.The House\u2019s tax credits are flat but rise with age as a proxy for health expenses. By extending the credits to all income levels through the upper middle class, the idea is to minimize work disincentives, where earning an extra dollar of income means losing a dollar or more of federal benefits. The Senate\u2019s credits are more generous than the House\u2019s, and thus more costly to the federal fisc, and also means-tested.The fear among Senators is that the House approach doesn\u2019t prioritize resources and lacks sufficient \u201cheart\u201d for the less affluent, as President       Trump       has put it. The House also would create its own work disincentive for people who leave Medicaid as their income rises slightly above the poverty line and would then become exposed to the full out-of-pocket cost of private insurance.The opportunity is to show that center-right solutions can get better results than government in the form of lower premiums and more coverage options. The Senate includes about $100 billion for a \u201cstability fund\u201d that would start to contain ObamaCare\u2019s damage and could be used by creative Governors to support insurance markets, as states like Maine and Alaska have recently demonstrated.The House bill creates waivers that would allow states to opt out of most ObamaCare regulations and mandates, but this provision violates Senate budget rules. The Senate adapts an Affordable Care Act program called 1332 waivers that would become nearly identical in practice. Freed from federal command-and-control, partially deregulated state insurers could sell a much wider variety of products.There\u2019s one exception to the waivers: The Senate wouldn\u2019t allow states to apply to relax the community rating regulation, which limits how much premiums can vary among individuals with different health risks to a 3-to-1 ratio. This rule helps explain why costs have exploded and enrollment is declining, but Republicans have shown they are hapless in the pre-existing conditions debate. Better to fight another day than doom the entire effort.Importantly, the Senate bill also repeals all of ObamaCare\u2019s tax hikes, including the industry taxes that are passed on to consumers and the 3.8-percentage-point surtax on investment income. Some Senators pushed to keep the surtax to avoid the tax-cuts-for-the-rich label and spend the revenue on something else, but the payoff in economic growth and rising incomes outweighs the temporary political hit.Republicans have campaigned across four elections against ObamaCare, and now Americans will see if they have the courage of their professed convictions. Conservatives must determine if progress that is politically feasible is preferable to impossible ideological purity, and moderates must defend policy substance from the distortions of critics.Four conservative Senators said Thursday they oppose the draft in its current form, enough to kill it. They say they\u2019re open to negotiation, but Majority Leader McConnell\u2019s goal over many weeks of talks has been to produce a bill that can get 50 votes. Perhaps       Mike Lee,       Ted Cruz,       Rand Paul       and       Ron Johnson       are merely trying to coax one or two policy changes during debate, but a final \u201cno\u201d really would be a vote to live with ObamaCare.Failure would expose Republicans as feckless, with conservatives attacking the GOP for having failed and Democrats attacking the GOP for having tried. And don\u2019t think Republicans could then drop the issue. Republicans would be under enormous pressure to shore up the failing insurance markets in this Congress. The question is whether they do it on their terms with this bill, or later on Democratic leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s. Republicans would splinter over \u201cbailing out\u201d ObamaCare, while Democrats demand more money in return for help.The Senate bill is imperfect, but it includes many conservative policy victories that have long been Republican goals. It\u2019s not too much to say this is a defining moment for whether the GOP can ever reform runaway entitlements. If Republicans fail, the next stop is single payer.Appeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-22 19:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-senates-health-care-advance-1498173842", "news_title": "The Senate\u2019s Health-Care Advance", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,editorials,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services"}, {"content": "Former Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive       Travis Kalanick       knew an engineer had allegedly stolen Google files before hiring the engineer last year, according to Uber\u2019s attorneys.It is the first evidence that Uber executives were aware of the files of self-driving technology that are at the center of a lawsuit between Uber and Google parent             Alphabet Inc.        GOOGL 0.59%However, Uber attorneys said, when Mr. Kalanick learned of the files in March 2016, he instructed the engineer to not bring them to Uber. That engineer, former Google executive Anthony Levandowski, later told Uber he destroyed the files before Uber bought his startup for $680 million in August 2016 and he was appointed to lead Uber\u2019s self-driving team, they said.The revelation came in court documents filed late Wednesday, shedding new light on what Uber executives knew about the allegedly stolen files and when.Alphabet\u2019s driverless-car unit Waymo \u201chas been making up a story that Uber asked Mr. Levandowski to bring material over [from] Google, when the truth is the exact opposite,\u201c Uber lead attorney Arturo Gonzalez said in an interview. \u201cThis new development proves Uber never wanted any Google info.\u201dWaymo said in a statement, \u201cThe evidence clearly shows Waymo\u2019s trade secrets have been used in Uber\u2019s self-driving car project. By their own admission, Uber leadership knew about these unlawful acts and far from doing the right thing, they tried to conceal it.\u201dIn the filing, Waymo argued the new details showed Uber violated an earlier court order to turn over any information about the deletion of the allegedly stolen files.

Attorneys for Mr. Levandowski, who was fired by Uber last month for not cooperating in the lawsuit, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.In response to a Waymo request for information, Uber attorneys said earlier this month that in March 2016, when Uber was looking into Mr. Levandowski\u2019s driverless-truck startup as an acquisition target, Mr. Levandowski told Mr. Kalanick and other Uber executives that he had \u201cfive discs in his possession containing Google information.\u201dUber attorneys said Mr. Kalanick then told Mr. Levandowski he \u201cshould not bring any Google information into Uber and that Uber did not want any Google information.\u201dWrite to Jack Nicas at jack.nicas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 19:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-ex-ceo-travis-kalanick-knew-of-stolen-google-files-1498163977", "news_title": "Uber Ex-CEO Travis Kalanick Knew of Stolen Google Files ", "keywords": "ride hailing,trade secrets,travis kalanick,uber,waymo,Waymo,Uber Technologies,Alphabet,GOOGL,GOOG,Google,Travis Kalanick,Arturo Gonzalez,executive Anthony Levandowski,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,burglary,theft,retail,wholesale,etailing,internet search engines,autonomous driving technologies,automotive,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "Efforts to replace Libor with a credible alternative have taken another step forward.Fifteen banks voted Thursday on a replacement for the U.S. dollar London interbank offered rate, the besmirched interest-rate benchmark that some of them were accused of rigging in an industrywide scandal a few years ago.Banks participating in the vote had settled on two likely candidates as of last year and decided on a rate derived from a broad set of borrowing transactions secured by U.S. Treasurys, according to a statement from the Alternative Reference Rates Committee. The individual vote tally wasn\u2019t disclosed, a spokesman for the committee said.Phasing in the new rate is expected to start next year on a voluntary basis, after the committee publishes a report on its work.Getting U.S. financial firms to migrate to the new benchmark won\u2019t be like flipping a switch. Libor has been deeply embedded in financial markets for decades and is used to set rates for hundreds of trillions of dollars of derivatives and other borrowings, including loans to consumers, companies and governments.In May, the U.K. announced an alternative reference rate to Libor for Sterling-based derivatives and other financial-market contracts.In the U.S., the committee has \u201cgot to have a plan to encourage the market to adopt it,\u201d said David Duffee, partner at law firm Mayer Brown.The banks that voted Thursday were brought together in 2014 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Fed Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., after certain banks were alleged to have manipulated Libor. Banks collectively paid billions of dollars to settle those investigations.At the time the committee was formed, neither of the U.S. alternative rates had been created. Even now, the preferred rate selected has to go through a round of public comment and won\u2019t be published until later this year or 2018.The rate the banks decided on is based on short-term loans known as repurchase agreements or \u201crepo\u201d trades, backed by Treasury securities as collateral. The New York Fed has proposed publishing the rate in cooperation with the Office of Financial Research.The chosen rate consists of transaction data from across the repo markets, including some provided by             Bank of New York Mellon Corp.       and others settled by a unit of the Wall Street-controlled utility Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. But it excludes trades struck one-for-one between firms that aren\u2019t processed by third parties, as well as repo trades conducted with the Fed.The runner up in the vote, the so-called Overnight Bank Funding Rate, is an overnight gauge of unsecured bank funding costs composed of transactions from the federal-funds market and Eurodollar trading. That rate has at times been beset by slumping trading volumes.Asset managers, including BlackRock and Pacific Investment Management Co., were consulted as part of an advisory group formed in November 2016 but didn\u2019t vote on Thursday. A significant majority of them had expressed a preference for the Treasury repo rate, ARRC said. Four financial market utilities also provided feedback.Last May, a Treasury group convened by the New York Fed recommended that industry participants use benchmarks that comply with new international financial-market standards. Those standards have been promoted by the International Organization of Securities Commissions.Sandra O\u2019Connor,        a             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. executive who chairs the ARCC, said in a statement following the vote that by selecting an alternative to Libor, the industry \u201ctook an important step to strengthen the financial system.\u201dFed governor       Jerome Powell       said in a separate statement he was confident the new rate is \u201cbased on a deep and actively traded market and will be highly robust.\u201dWrite to Katy Burne at katy.burne@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 19:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-vote-on-new-u-s-reference-rate-to-replace-libor-1498163666", "news_title": "Banks Pick New Reference Rate to Replace U.S. Dollar Libor", "keywords": "interest-rate benchmark,libor,Federal Reserve Bank of New York,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,interbank rate,london interbank offered rate,debt,bond markets,money,currency markets,money markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Rep.       Nancy Pelosi       became the target of blame almost instantly after Democrats lost a special U.S. House election in Georgia in which their candidate, backed by $30 million, was relentlessly tethered to the chamber\u2019s longtime Democratic leader.A corps of House Democrats, most of them young and without the tenure of the senior members who dominate party leadership, have reasserted their criticism that Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s unpopularity is a drag on them all.But the California lawmaker is unlikely to be dislodged as the House minority leader and it is more likely than not she will remain the chamber\u2019s senior Democrat after the 2018 election if she wants to be.\u201cI respect any opinion that my members have, but my decision about how long I stay is not up to them,\u201d\u00a0Mrs. Pelosi said Thursday. \u201cI think I\u2019m worth the trouble.\u201dAbout a dozen House Democratic lawmakers, led by Reps.       Seth Moulton       of Massachusetts and       Kathleen Rice       of New York, met\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0to discuss replacing Mrs. Pelosi. The meeting didn\u2019t end with any set plans.\u201cThere were people from all sides of the ideological spectrum that were in the room today, and that are approaching us about the need for change,\u201d Mr. Moulton said, referring to the various intraparty camps.Attacks tying Democratic candidates to Mrs. Pelosi do \u201cstill move the needle several points, and we\u2019ve got to be cognizant of that and figure out how we\u2019re going to deal with that,\u201d said Rep.       Tim Ryan,        an Ohio Democrat who challenged Mrs. Pelosi in a leadership election in November.First elected from her San Francisco district in 1987, Mrs. Pelosi, 77 years old, retains an unmatched record of political chits because of her relentless fundraising for her House colleagues and political success inside the Capitol passing major elements of former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       legislative agenda.Other than past presidents and vice presidents, Mrs. Pelosi is the top\u00a0living Democratic fundraiser, tapping her wealthy political network to direct $141.5 million to Democratic candidates and committees in the 2016 election cycle.\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to pin this on Nancy Pelosi,\u201d said former Rep.       Steve Israel       of New York whom Mrs. Pelosi twice tapped to be chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party\u2019s House political arm. \u201cIt\u2019s like managing a baseball team. You don\u2019t get enough credit for the special elections you win, and you get unwanted blame for the special elections you lose.\u201dDemocrats must win at least 24 seats from Republicans to take control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections.\u00a0With Mr. Obama out of office and Democrat       Hillary Clinton       off the campaign trail, it is a near certainty that Mrs. Pelosi will be used as a cudgel to attack every Democrat running for a House seat.Mrs. Pelosi remains deeply unpopular nationwide. In February, The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found 19% of Americans had a positive view of her, compared with 44% who viewed her negatively. Among Republicans and independents, her numbers were worse.The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.), spent $10 million on TV and mail attacking Georgia Democratic congressional hopeful       Jon Ossoff       and       Rob Quist,        the Democratic candidate in the special election in Montana in May. Mrs. Pelosi was featured in every piece of mail and all but one of the group\u2019s TV ads. She was also included in CLF\u2019s Spanish-language ad attacking Mr. Ossoff.A Republican analytics firm tracking the Georgia race found that of the 7,454 negative ads against Mr. Ossoff aired on broadcast television, 90% of them mentioned Mrs. Pelosi.In a statement on Twitter\u00a0Thursday, President       Donald Trump       offered Mrs. Pelosi a sarcastic endorsement, saying her departure would hurt the GOP.\u201cI certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party,\u201d the Republican president wrote.Mrs. Pelosi said\u00a0Saturday\u00a0that Republicans spend millions attacking her and linking her to Democratic candidates \u201cbecause I\u2019m effective as leader.\u201d She added: \u201cI passed the Affordable Care\u00a0Act, we passed Dodd-Frank, all the things that big money was unhappy about, whatever the role of government is in protecting a consumer, protecting their good health.\u201dIn November, House Democrats elected Mrs. Pelosi as their leader for an eighth term, but for the first time she faced significant opposition, surrendering 63 of 197 votes to Mr. Ryan.After Mr. Ossoff\u2019s loss, Mr. Ryan bemoaned the effectiveness of the television advertising tying the political newcomer in Georgia to Mrs. Pelosi. Several House Democrats who backed Mrs. Pelosi in that leadership election have said privately this week they would not vote for her again.\u201cI think if that vote had happened yesterday, it would have been closer to a majority of the caucus,\u201d rather than the supermajority she received in November, said Rep.       Jim Cooper       (D., Tenn.).Still, House Democrats seeking\u00a0new leadership said they don\u2019t anticipate an internal\u00a0party clash leading to demands for new leadership, similar to the one that led to the abrupt resignation of former Speaker       John Boehner       (R., Ohio) in 2015.\u201cWe\u2019re getting close to a point where a transition needs to take place, where some of the next generation and talent we have in the caucus will start to emerge,\u201d Rep.       Mike Doyle,        Democrat of Pennsylvania, said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not happening this week. This idea that there\u2019s some movement, that\u2019s not based in any reality.\u201dMr. Ossoff dodged the question of whether he would back Mrs. Pelosi for party leader if elected, saying he would weigh the options once in office. But an increasing number of Democratic congressional candidates are seeking to protect themselves from Pelosi-related attacks by saying they won\u2019t vote for her.\u201cI would not support her,\u201d said       Ken Harbaugh,        a Democrat who in June launched a campaign for a House seat in northeast Ohio. \u201cUnless we right the ship and realize that politics as usual is part of the problem, we\u2019re going to keep losing.\u201dWrite to Reid J.

The charge is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, and more charges are possible.On Wednesday\u00a0morning, Mr. Ftouhi dropped his luggage in a restroom at Bishop International Airport, walked back out into the public area, pulled out a knife with an 8-inch serrated blade, yelled \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic, and stabbed Lt.

A spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police declined to comment.Mr. Ftouhi lived in a low-rise, white-brick apartment building in the east end of Montreal\u2019s working-class, ethnically diverse neighborhood of Saint-Michel, just north of the stadium used in the 1976 Summer Olympics.Mr. Ftouhi\u2019s landlord told Le Journal de Montreal that the suspect had lived in the building for three or four years. Luciano Piazza said Mr. Ftouhi didn\u2019t cause any trouble and at times cleaned the stairways in the three-level, nine-unit building.A neighbor who wouldn\u2019t give her name said Mr. Ftouhi is a quiet, peaceful man. \u201cWhen I saw him he said, hello, good evening.

As this year\u2019s commemoration comes to a close on Saturday, I\u2019ve been thinking about what my move to the U.S. from Pakistan taught me about Ramadan, myself, my family and our community.My earliest memories of Ramadan are in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. For one month, Muslims do not eat or drink from daybreak to sundown. At age 7, I would plead with my mother to let me fast as the adults do. Three years later she let me, but only for a half a day one Sunday. At 13, I was formally inducted into the class of fasting young adults.A new moon in the evening sky marks the beginning of Ramadan\u2014we follow the lunar calendar\u2014and the whole nation rejoices. Ramadan greetings are heard in homes, stores, everywhere. The neighborhood mosques are in their glory, the faithful singing, glorifying God and the Prophet       Muhammad.       All of Pakistan seems to come alive at night during Ramadan.We would wake around 3 a.m. for a meal before dawn. At the first appearance of light and the sound of \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d the call to prayer, my fast would begin. I\u2019d spread my prayer rug facing Mecca and stand in the presence of God to offer my prayer. A few minutes later I\u2019d be in bed, trying to get some sleep.It\u2019s a whole different world when everyone is fasting. The nation slows down. No tea breaks in offices, no lunch hours, no ladies\u2019 coffee parties. Our teachers would remind us that on Ramadan there is no fighting, lying or cheating. I\u2019d feel lazy and sleepy in class. I\u2019d come home from school to the murmurs of elders reciting the Quran and then take my delicious afternoon nap. An hour before sundown, I\u2019d retrieve a copy of the Quran\u2014wrapped in green velvet\u2014from the highest shelf of the mantle, kiss it, touch it against my forehead, and recite lines from it.Shops on the street open late, close again for siesta, and then reopen with a bang. Shoppers flood the bazaar, buying dates, samosas, and freshly baked naan from clay ovens. The shops close right before sundown, and everyone heads home to break the fast.Then I came to the U.S., and Pakistan\u2019s palpable energy was gone. For a decade my husband and I did not fast. Only when my children started growing up did we feel compelled to return to the ritual. Our hiatus ended when our 11-year-old son arrived home one day and asked: \u201cRamadan starts tomorrow. Aren\u2019t you going to fast?\u201dThe first day I got a splitting headache from caffeine withdrawal. I wondered, is this how it\u2019s going to be for an entire month? But by the third day my headaches were gone and I wasn\u2019t thinking much about food or water. The only real struggles were staying awake and deciding how to explain my religious beliefs to coworkers. During a meeting, when I fumbled for a date to break my fast, someone called for a 10-minute break, and another brought me coffee and a cupcake.In Pakistan, iftar\u2014the meal eaten after sunset during Ramadan\u2014was a family affair. We didn\u2019t have many relatives here, so other Muslim families in New York became our extended family. Every weekend one of the families would host an iftar at their home. Just before Ramadan started, I would start getting calls about who was hosting one and when.If you didn\u2019t like someone, too bad, you had to invite everyone. I\u2019d spend the whole day cooking a feast, the aroma whetting my appetite. Guests would start arriving an hour before iftar, remove their shoes in the foyer, take a seat on the carpet and recite the Quran. If 30 people came, each would take a volume. By sundown, we collectively would read the entire Quran. The home, family and guests would be blessed with positive energy and blessings from the divine word. We\u2019d break fast together, pray together; and at dinner, the sounds of chatter and children playing would energize my home.One year my father, on a visit from Pakistan, remarked he\u2019d never seen anything like our Ramadan celebration. He was referring to the communal spirit, the iftars, the reading of the Quran and the congregational prayers in the home.In New York we were compelled to build a community for our children, and communal iftars were the perfect setting for them to develop reverence for their faith and to get comfortable in their skin. It took a while, but I realized that what I thought I had been missing by moving to the U.S. had been there all along.Ms. Rehman is the author of \u201cThreading My Prayer Rug: One Woman\u2019s Journey from Pakistani Muslim to American Muslim\u201d (Arcade, 2016).Appeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-22 18:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ramadan-american-style-1498171181", "news_title": "Ramadan, American Style", "keywords": "islam,muhammad,muslim,muslim holidays,ramadan,political,general news,society,community,religion,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "As the battle around net neutrality rages again, we need to take stock, and ask ourselves: What is the debate really about, and why should business leaders and entrepreneurs care?Businesses of all sizes create value, jobs and investment opportunities online. Their innovation and value creation are wholly dependent on access to internet connectivity. Net neutrality is the principle that all content must be treated without discrimination, be it commercial or political. Neutral networks are critical to ensuring fair, open competition in the content market and driving America\u2019s growth in the digital era.Net neutrality allowed me to invent the World Wide Web without having to ask anyone for permission or pay a fee to ensure that people could use my idea. Now imagine what would happen if internet service providers\u2014usually a handful of big cable companies that control the connectivity market\u2014were allowed to violate net neutrality. Their gatekeeping powers could be used to require businesses and individuals to pay a premium to ensure their content is delivered on equal terms\u2014or even at all. This would create barriers that disadvantage small businesses and startups across all sectors that rely on the internet in any way.In the early days of the web, ISPs saw demand for their services surge as people encountered content like never before. As more people got connected, they created more content. A virtuous circle of growth and innovation ensued. You could always access any website over any connection. The technology of the underlying internet advanced dramatically from phone modems to fiber, with speeds available in a home connection growing by a factor of a million. Connectivity and content saw an explosion in growth as separate markets.But a power struggle emerged as both markets evolved and incentives for ISPs to abuse their abilities to increase profit margins became stronger. Court battles followed, and enforceable net-neutrality rules became a necessity. In 2015 the Federal Communications Commission responded by classifying internet access as a Title II service. That establishes broadband as a vital utility, giving the FCC the requisite authority to enforce net neutrality.Today, with billions of dollars at stake in the competition for views, sales and clicks, the incentives for ISPs to violate net neutrality for profit have never been greater. Yet the FCC is now proposing to roll back the rules that were put in place to neutralize those perverse incentives.Do we want a web where cable companies determine winners and losers online? Where they decide which opinions we read, which creative ideas succeed? That\u2019s not the web I want. To judge by support in opinion polls for upholding net neutrality, it\u2019s not the web you want either.The future of innovation, freedom of speech and democracy in America depend on strong, and enforceable net neutrality rules. So the question is: Will we fight hard for the web we want?The last time this war was waged, more than a million people submitted comments to the FCC. On July 12, the Day of Action for Net Neutrality, 90 businesses and organizations will join forces to protect the open internet. Participating companies will display alerts on their home pages simulating \u201cblocked\u201d messages that users would receive regularly in a world without net neutrality. These homepage alerts will give users the option to send a message to Congress and the FCC before clicking out.

Those who have stayed for fewer years would have a path to eventually apply for that status.\u201cThe U.K.\u2019s position represents a fair and serious offer and one aimed at giving as much certainty as possible to citizens who have settled in the U.K., building careers and lives and contributing so much to our society,\u201d the prime minister said.While the proposals may be palatable to EU leaders in their general outline, tougher challenges are likely to emerge in working out the details, such as rights of family members of EU citizens and which courts would rule on disputes over those rights.Speaking on her way out of the meeting, German Chancellor Angela Merkel described Mrs. May\u2019s offer on citizens\u2019 rights as \u201ca good start\u201d but said \u201cmany, many other questions remain,\u201d for instance on Britain\u2019s financial settlement with the EU and on issues regarding the border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.Leaders didn\u2019t respond to Mrs. May\u2019s offer while she was in the room, as they had previously said negotiations would be left to the two sides\u2019 negotiating teams. Once she left the room they briefly discussed her presentation, according to an EU official who was present.\u201cOnce she was gone we said, \u2018OK, that was interesting, but now it\u2019s for [EU negotiator] Michel Barnier to evaluate it,\u2019 \u201d Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said.Mrs. May, speaking at the end of a dinner with the other 27 EU leaders, said she wanted to provide clarity to the roughly three million EU citizens living in the U.K., whose future status there has hung in question since the U.K. voted a year ago to leave the bloc.She said her offer would stand only if the EU agrees to give reciprocal rights to the roughly one million British people living in the EU.\u2018Once she was gone we said, \u2018O.K., that was interesting, but now it\u2019s for [EU negotiator] Michel Barnier to evaluate it.\u2019The EU has already said it was seeking the full range of rights and benefits EU and British citizens currently enjoy on each others\u2019 territories.The host of the Brussels summit, Donald Tusk, played down expectations about a detailed Brexit discussion during the dinner.\u201cIt must be clear that the European Council is not a forum for the Brexit negotiations. We have our negotiators for this, and so leaders will only take note of these intentions,\u201d he said ahead of Mrs. May\u2019s presentation.Britain\u2019s vote last year to leave the EU has significant consequences, both for British people living in other parts of Europe and for Europeans living in the U.K., and her plan for these people left a lot of questions unanswered. Mrs. May has said the U.K. would in the future no longer abide by European rules on the free movement of people, which allow citizens to live and work anywhere in the bloc.Mrs. May was meeting EU leaders in Brussels for the first time since she lost her parliamentary majority in an election that dented her standing at home and abroad. The response of EU officials in the coming weeks will be an early test of her strength in the negotiations.Differences between the two sides may emerge over the cutoff date for migrants to have arrived in the U.K. for the proposed rights to apply, as well as over what rights would apply to the families of EU citizens living in the U.K. Another divisive issue may be whether the top European court has jurisdiction to enforce the rights of EU citizens in the U.K. A British government official said U.K. courts would have jurisdiction over EU citizens in Britain.Mrs. May declined to go into detail about some of the more difficult issues, saying they would be laid out in a paper that the government will publish Monday. The paper will outline various scenarios of EU citizens living in the U.K. to help explain the proposals, a senior government official said.Once she finished her presentation, Mrs. May left and the other leaders continued to discuss issues including which countries should host the European Medicines Agency and European Banking Authority, EU bodies which are currently based in the U.K. but will be transferred because of Brexit.Some EU officials criticized Mrs. May for taking time away from other issues, such as Europe\u2019s migration crisis, by speaking about details of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU.German Chancellor Angela Merkel underlined that while she supports the idea of granting EU citizens\u2019 rights as broadly as possible, the negotiations are carried out by Michel Barnier, the bloc\u2019s Brexit negotiator, rather than at the level of EU leaders.\u201cWe have bigger things at 28 to talk about,\u201d said one senior EU official.Write to Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.com and Valentina Pop at valentina.pop@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'U.K.\u2019s May Broaches EU Citizens\u2019 Rights.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 18:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/theresa-may-to-woo-eu-leaders-with-rights-for-citizens-1498143731", "news_title": "Theresa May to Allow EU Citizens to Stay in U.K. Post-Brexit", "keywords": "brexit, brexit talks, european union, theresa may,European Union,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,migration,politics"}, {"content": "As a critic, I\u2019ve been around the block, buster.

And if it won\u2019t hold still I hit it with a pan. Is that really so novel?As that paragraph gratingly demonstrates, puns can be irritating. Yet the vast and diverse English language practically cries out for antics of this sort, and some people are so good at it that punning has evolved into a form of competitive sport. \u201cWay more pun competitions exist than most sane civilians might presume,\u201d we learn from \u201cAway With Words,\u201d       Joe Berkowitz\u2019s       diverting account of the subject. \u201cThere\u2019s Minnesota\u2019s Pundamonium, Orlando Punslingers, the UK Pun Championships, the Almost Annual Pun-Off in Eureka, California, and several others.\u201dMr. Berkowitz, a staff writer at Fast Company, rashly immerses himself in this world over the course of a year, palling around with punsters and competing repeatedly in Brooklyn\u2019s Punderdome and once at the exalted O. Henry Pun-Off World Championships in Austin, Texas. \u201cThe O. Henry is without a doubt the Olympics of pun competitions,\u201d he says, while \u201cPunderdome is their X Games.\u201dThe narrative engine of \u201cAway With Words\u201d is the author\u2019s progress through this quirky landscape, from his first anxious appearance at Punderdome right up through his star turn in Austin. The competitions require firing off puns\u2014preferably as part of a comic narrative\u2014on a given or chosen topic, such as vegetables or fine arts, in front of a raucous crowd. Mr. Berkowitz is no wilting flower, but the performing isn\u2019t easy for him. Competitions involve intense time pressure and one-on-one pun-offs; if words fail you, you\u2019re out. (The O. Henry is governed by persnickety judges; in Brooklyn, applause rules.)By Joe Berkowitz  Harper Perennial, 272 pages, $15.99At this level, even the strangest topics provide almost inexhaustible fodder. At Punderdome\u2019s fifth anniversary show, for example, the category is Italian food. On introduction: \u201cI never sausage a crowd.\u201d Want to try something weird? \u201cI said \u2018wine not\u2019. . . because I\u2019m a pro sicko.\u201d About cheating to win an award: \u201cI think I could rig a Tony.\u201d On reproductive rights: \u201cThe government wants to put its laws on your bodies,\u201d one punster declares. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want \u2019em to put their laws-on-ya!\u201d On the wonders of modernity: \u201cHow did scientists date anything before the carbon era?\u201dBy now you may be reaching for the Alka-Seltzer, which illustrates the author\u2019s problem: A little punning goes a long way, and at some point indigestion is inevitable. Mr. Berkowitz also tries readers\u2019 patience with one or two ill-advised digressions, although his firsthand account of the dismally earnest North East Texas Humor Research Conference is a source of fun in spite of his sufferings there. Fortunately, the puns mostly come in concentrated outbursts, and Mr. Berkowitz works so furiously to entertain us the rest of the time that you can practically see the flop sweat.\u201cAway With Words\u201d is peopled, moreover, by a colorful and touchingly needy cast of punsters. With their noms-de-pun (e.g., Groan Up, Lex Icon), they are tough to keep straight but, like witty strangers at a cocktail party, amusing nonetheless.       Benjamin Ziek,        the       Babe Ruth       of competitive punning, is easy to remember, \u201cbuzz-cut and built like a cross between a circus strongman and Sopranos consigliere.\u201d The book culminates in a thrilling Texas gunfight between a contingent of Punderdome all-stars and O. Henry veterans. One of the stars, Southpaw Jones, soars with a prepared riff on birds: \u201cBeek kind to me, don\u2019t thrush to judgment, I\u2019m not robin anyone, hawking anything, talon tails out of school, ducking responsibilities or emulating anyone.\u201d In a face-off segment, punster       Jerry Yan       is assigned the topic of pregnancy and starts on a pious note: \u201cBaby Jesus didn\u2019t diaper your sins.\u201dOne question remains: Why has punning, which is as old as language, fallen into such bad odor that most of us feel compelled to groan when we encounter it, no matter how witty the wordplay?       John Pollack,        in his thoughtful 2011 book, \u201cThe Pun Also Rises,\u201d notes that punning\u2019s popularity has long ebbed and flowed. A case in point: Puns used to flourish in headlines, including at this newspaper. Oh, for the days of \u201cParamount in the Dark Before the Don,\u201d an article concerning studio jitters about a forthcoming \u201cGodfather\u201d film. Nowadays cooler heads prevail, in part because the news has moved online, where wordplay in headlines is death for search-engine optimization. The rapid globalization of culture may also play a role. The English writer Kazuo Ishiguro has confessed to avoiding wordplay and colloquialisms in order to facilitate the translation of his works. World trade, it seems, is taking the pun out of literature.Ultimately, the problem may be that pun-making is a kind of preening. Puns \u201care more usually praised for their ingenuity than for their humor,\u201d a 16th-century courtier\u2019s handbook observed, and pedantic vanity will always rub people the wrong way\u2014especially in these times of disdain for the special claims of authority.Back in Austin, after the final O. Henry round pits one of Brooklyn\u2019s best against a four-time national champ, Mr. Berkowitz hears talk among the sloshed New Yorkers of getting a pun tattoo. What should it say? \u201cWe can write \u2018ling,\u2019 \u201d suggests one wag, \u201cand it will be an \u2018inkling.\u2019 \u201dBut it\u2019s clear that a pun tattoo\u2014the absurd made flesh\u2014would be going too far. Mr. Berkowitz is sensitive throughout to the evanescence and contingency of punning and to the fleeting chemistry of a live pun-on-pun matchup crackling with energy. \u201cA tattoo could never bring it back,\u201d he writes. \u201cYou had to be there.\u201dMr. Akst writes the Journal\u2019s weekly news quiz.Appeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-22 18:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/low-wit-in-its-highest-form-1498171136", "news_title": "Low Wit in Its Highest Form", "keywords": "book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "After a humbling loss in Tuesday\u2019s special election in Georgia, Democrats may be wondering if they ought to stop demonizing President Trump and instead work with him to kick-start economic growth.An often overlooked but critical feature of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax-reform proposal gives Democrats the perfect opportunity to meet him at the bargaining table. When Mr. Trump introduced \u201cthe biggest individual and business tax cut in American history,\u201d he said he would \u201celiminate targeted tax breaks\u201d\u2014including the federal deduction for state and local taxes. Also known as the SALT deduction, this $100 billion annual tax break to state and local governments has been on the books since 1913, even surviving Reagan tax reform. But this time, threatening the federal deduction may seal a tax deal for the GOP. Here\u2019s why:First, it\u2019s hard for Democrats to argue that the tax reductions in Mr. Trump\u2019s plan are budget-busters when killing the SALT deduction would add $1.3 trillion to federal coffers over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That would pay for a lot of personal and business tax cuts, even without factoring in the faster growth that could pay for those cuts over time.Second, Democrats can\u2019t say Mr. Trump\u2019s plan isn\u2019t real reform. The SALT deduction is a distortive subsidy to states. It encourages them to raise taxes, because voters can deduct those higher taxes from their federal tax bill.Third, there\u2019s little in this for red states, because they generally have lower tax rates to begin with. Therefore, according to the Internal Revenue Service, blue states with higher tax rates receive about two-thirds of this break. In fact, half of the $100 billion tax break goes to six deep-blue states: California, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. Democrats in favor of preserving the SALT deduction are simply self-interested.Fourth, eliminating the SALT deduction makes it harder for Democrats to label the Trump tax reforms \u201ca sop to the rich.\u201d It mainly applies to higher-earning taxpayers who itemize deductions, so the richest 20% of taxpayers get 14 times the benefit from it enjoyed by the poorest 20%, according to the Congressional Budget Office.What scares Democrats most, however, is that the GOP can take away the SALT deduction\u2014and achieve anything on taxes\u2014without a single Democratic vote in the Congress.To be sure, there are Republican legislators in blue states who might not like the idea of being the collateral damage of reform. Initially a couple GOP representatives expressed qualms, but they understand this is a bargaining maneuver. Even so, the stakes are more daunting for the Democrats: Losing the SALT deduction begins a slippery slope toward losing more subsidies.To spur growth, President Trump\u2019s main goal is to lower income and business tax rates. But putting the SALT deduction on the chopping block gives him the leverage he needs to force Democrats to work with him.There\u2019s really only one kind of help Mr. Trump needs. Under Senate rules currently, a tax-reform bill could be passed with 52 GOP votes (or as few as 50, with Vice President Pence casting the tie-breaker). But if the bill isn\u2019t revenue-neutral and increases the forecast deficit, it would have to expire automatically after 10 years or so. Ideally, tax reform would be permanent, allowing businesses and individuals to make long-term plans. But that would take a filibuster-proof 60 votes. This is where the SALT deduction becomes Mr. Trump\u2019s chief bargaining chip: Republicans could offer to keep the SALT deduction, in exchange for eight yea votes from the Democrats.There are 10 Democratic senators who face re-election in 2018 in states Mr. Trump carried last November. Three of them\u2014      Heidi Heitkamp       of North Dakota,       Joe Manchin       of West Virginia and       Joe Donnelly       of Indiana\u2014voted with the GOP majority to confirm       Neil Gorsuch       to the Supreme Court, risking their party\u2019s disfavor. They might also be inclined to support Mr. Trump\u2019s tax reforms\u2014and five more could easily join them when they realize their seeming defection could win them votes in a tough midterm election.Surely this is what Mr. Trump meant in his speech in Iowa on Wednesday, when he challenged Democrats to help on tax reform: \u201cIf we had even a little Democrat support .\u00a0.\u00a0. we\u2019d be willing to change it and make it even better.\u201dBut the GOP wins either way. If they make no deal with the Democrats, tax cuts may not be permanent, but they can be even bigger thanks to the revenue from abolishing the SALT deduction. And a 10-year automatic expiration of reform leaves a lot of time to come up with eight votes.Mr. Luskin is chief investment officer at Trend Macrolytics LLC.Appeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-22 18:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-democrats-pound-salt-1498171037", "news_title": "Will Democrats Pound SALT?", "keywords": "budget proposal,salt deduction,tax deductions,tax reform,trump budget,economic performance,indicators,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Mayoral control of New York City schools is in limbo after the session adjourned, at least temporarily, without renewing it.

The Senate bill is broadly similar to a version passed by the House in early May but differs in a few key ways fromA: The ACA\u2019s protections for people with costly pre-existing medical conditions would stay in place. That means insurance companies couldn\u2019t deny people with pre-existing conditions health coverage or charge them higher premiums. Under the House bill, insurers in some states could charge sicker people higher premiums, which conservative House lawmakers argued could help lower premiums for other people. But Senate lawmakers rejected that idea. States could get waivers to roll back benefits that must now be required under the ACA, and that could leave people with certain medical conditions paying more for their coverage.A: The Senate bill would phase out the enhanced federal funding for Medicaid\u2019s expansion, which increased eligibility for the program to people making up to 38% above the federal poverty line and insured 14 million additional people. Federal payments for the expansion would wind down over three years beginning in 2021 and be phased out by 2024. States could keep the expansion but wouldn\u2019t get enhanced federal funding to pay for it.A: The bill also introduces a broader structural change to the program. Rather than allowing states to receive open-ended payments from the federal government, the bill would cap the amount of money states receive, tied to the number of people enrolled in their Medicaid programs. Those payments would grow over time\u2014they are indexed to a form of inflation\u2014but that growth is likely to lag the actual growth in health-care costs, meaning the federal government would eventually pay less money compared with current levels. The growth rate is scheduled to be further lowered in 2025.A: The Senate bill tinkers with the ACA\u2019s premium subsidies, which would be determined based on a person\u2019s income, age and location. It lowers the eligibility requirements for people to qualify for the subsidies\u2014from 400% of the poverty line down to 350%\u2014and ties them to a skimpier benchmark plan. Together, those changes mean that people will receive smaller subsidies going forward. That approach differs from the House bill, which created a new set of tax credits and tied them mainly to a person\u2019s age.A: The bill provides funding for \u201ccost-sharing reduction\u201d payments, which help insurers offset subsidies for low-income consumers, through the end of 2019. That would end months of wavering by the Trump administration over whether to continue the payments, which it has characterized as a bailout for the insurance industry.The payments would provide a measure of relief to insurers with plans in the ACA marketplaces; many have cited uncertainty about the future of the payments as a reason for premium-rate increases next year. If the payments end beginning in 2020, that could ultimately result in larger deductibles and copayments for people with low incomes who had benefited from the subsidies.A. Not right now. GOP lawmakers hope the broad scope of their bill will lower premiums and entice more young, healthy people to sign up. But there are currently no consequences if they don\u2019t. The House bill added a provision known as a \u2018continuous coverage\u2019 surcharge, which would have temporarily raised people\u2019s premiums by 30% if they signed up for a health plan after going 63 or more days without any kind of insurance. But it isn\u2019t clear the measure met the Senate\u2019s complex budget rules.A. Overall, older Americans who don\u2019t yet qualify for Medicare would see their premiums rise under the Senate bill. That is because it would allow insurers to charge their oldest customers up to five times more than their youngest ones, compared with three times more under the ACA, while subsidies to help them buy insurance would be significantly pared back.A. Yes, it bars Medicaid from making any payments to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, but only for one year. Lawmakers couldn\u2019t include a permanent ban because a permanent ban would result in more spending due to increased births, violating the special budget rules senators are using in their attempt to pass the bill.Separately, the bill would require that the tax credits people use to buy insurance could only be used to buy a health plan that doesn\u2019t offer any abortion benefits.A. The bill allocates $2 billion in 2018 to fund opioid treatment programs. But so far, the larger pot of money some senators were discussing, to the tune of about $40 billion, hasn\u2019t been included. That funding was supposed to make up for the fact that people with substance-use disorders could lose health coverage if the Medicaid expansion is rolled back. More money could still be added back into the bill.A. It almost certainly will. Senators are calling the version of the bill they released today a \u201cdiscussion draft,\u201d and they are continuing to discuss proposals to win over 50 GOP Senators\u2014the magic number needed to get the bill passed. Four conservative Senators have already raised objections to the bill, so modifications may be needed to get them on board. More centrist senators are also demanding changes. Some, like       Rob Portman       of Ohio, want more money for opioid treatment. Sen.       Susan Collins       of Maine plans to introduce an amendment excising the provision defunding Planned Parenthood. And we can expect that several other provisions included in this draft could hit procedural hurdles and need to be taken out.Write to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 18:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/assessing-the-impact-of-the-senate-gop-health-bill-1498170886", "news_title": "Assessing the Impact of the Senate GOP Health Bill", "keywords": "aca,gop health bill,healthcare,healthcare bill,health care bill,medicaid,new health care bill,republican health bill ,senate health bill,senate healthcare bill,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance"}, {"content": "Public opinion of       Donald Trump       remains stable after one of the rockiest months of his presidency, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll has found, but half of Americans hold negative views of his temperament, trustworthiness and level of knowledge needed for his job.The June poll found that more people disapprove of Mr. Trump\u2019s job performance than approve, but in numbers that have barely changed in the weeks since the FBI confirmed that it was investigating Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with the Trump campaign.Some 40% in the survey approved of Mr. Trump\u2019s job performance, essentially unchanged from its 39% mark a month earlier. Some 55% in the new survey disapproved of his job performance.The results suggest that while official Washington is preoccupied with the investigation, the issue isn\u2019t having much of an impact on public opinion outside the nation\u2019s capital.\u201cThere is nothing to indicate that weeks of dialogue on Russia have engaged the American public,\u201d said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who conducted the survey with Democrat Fred Yang. \u201cThere is a gap between what we [in Washington] are focusing on and what they are focusing on.\u201dBut the poll of 900 adults also pointed to a continuing weakness in Mr. Trump\u2019s standing as a leader. When people were asked to rate him on qualities of trustworthiness, temperament and knowledge needed to be president, about half\u2014including 48% of independents\u2014rated him negatively on all three qualities.\u201cIf half of the American public cannot count on him in these critical leadership elements, he will never be able to unite the nation,\u201d said Democratic pollster       Peter Hart,        who worked on the survey.Mr. Trump and his party have an important thing going for them, the poll found: the economy, the issue that is typically of premier political consequence in U.S. elections. When asked which party they trust more to handle the economy, people picked Republicans over Democrats, 36% to 29%.Six in 10 people think the economy has improved during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, and 38% give him some credit.Democrats hold the advantage on another issue that is occupying center stage: health care. Asked which party is better equipped to deal with health care, 43% said the Democratic Party and 26% said the Republicans.By a 41%-to-38% margin, more people said they thought the Affordable Care Act is a good idea than a bad one. By contrast, the House GOP bill to repeal and replace the ACA is viewed as a good idea by 16%, down from 23% a month ago, mostly due to eroding support among Republicans.\u201cIt is clear that the House plan has already been disqualified in terms of American public opinion,\u201d said Mr. McInturff. \u201cThe last month has been withering.\u201dIn the month since the last Journal/NBC News poll, Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and there were reports that Mr. Trump\u2019s firing of onetime FBI Director       James Comey       has become part of the investigation. Russia has denied the election-interference allegations and President Trump has called the investigation \u201ca witch hunt.\u201dRepublicans have been worried that those controversies and Mr. Trump\u2019s unusually low approval ratings will be a drag on GOP candidates in the 2018 midterm elections. Party leaders were relieved when Republican Karen Handel beat Democrat       Jon Ossoff       in a special election for a U.S. House seat from Georgia this week.While Democrats are smarting from the high-profile loss and defeats in three other special elections in conservative House districts recently, the poll found that on a national basis, Democrats have an advantage: 50% of registered voters in the survey said they wanted the 2018 elections to produce a Democratic-controlled Congress, while 42% wanted Republicans to retain control.In assessing Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, the country is divided over the main obstacles facing him. Asked the source of his problems over the past few months, half of adults said Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t have the competence and experience needed to change Washington, compared with 42% who cited opposition from traditional politicians or the news media as a main source of his problems.One mark of the nation\u2019s heated political environment surfaced when people were asked about the recent shooting near Washington, D.C., that gravely injured Rep. Steve Scalise (R., La.) and others. Four in 10 said a contributing factor to the incident was extreme political rhetoric used by some in the media and some political leaders. A plurality of 46% said they thought the shooting was just an isolated incident by a disturbed person.By contrast, in 2011, when then-Rep. Gabby Giffords (D., Ariz.) was shot in her district, people were much less likely to see the incident as incited by political rhetoric. Seven in 10 saw it as an isolated incident; 24% said extreme rhetoric in public discourse was a contributing factor.Mr. Yang said the poll pointed to a broader trend in the country that could be contributing to polarization in Washington. \u201cNeither side trusts the other and believes the other is lying,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with this level of distrust, is it any wonder Washington seems perpetually dysfunctional.\u201dThe Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey of 900 adults was conducted June 17-20.

Congress should enable all this by appropriating the $5 billion or so a year above current levels that such a strategy will require.America\u2019s leaders should not lose sight of why the U.S. went to, and has stayed in, Afghanistan: It is in our national interest to ensure that country is not once again a sanctuary for transnational extremists, as it was when the 9/11 attacks were planned there. We have been accomplishing that mission since the intervention began in October 2001. Although al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is diminished, it could rebound if given the opportunity. Islamic State could expand its newfound Afghan foothold as well.The augmented troop levels Mr. Trump has authorized would be only 12% to 15% of the peak U.S. force levels, in 2010-11. The country can sustain that level of commitment. While all casualties are tragic, our losses in Afghanistan would likely remain far fewer than the losses from another major terrorist attack in the U.S.Today the U.S. and its coalition partners lack the capacity to train and assist Afghan forces adequately in the field. As recently as 2015, the allied forces did not even have a full-time advisory presence for the main Afghan army corps in Helmand province. Largely as a result, the Taliban gained control of much of the province. Nor did the coalition have adequate advisers to help the smaller Afghan formations near Kunduz before that city fell to the Taliban in 2015. It was later liberated only at high cost, especially to Afghan forces and civilians. Restrictions on coalition air power reduced America\u2019s ability to help Afghan partners.Adding some 3,000 to 5,000 U.S. and allied troops could provide the capacity for several dozen deployable mentoring teams. That is far from enough to assist each Afghan brigade or battalion. But it could support the units that are engaged in the toughest fights and are most intensively involved in rebuilding their capabilities. Supporting those teams logistically and with air power, and providing quick-reaction forces in several parts of the country to help them if they get in trouble, would drive additional requirements for coalition troops into the low thousands.On the civilian side, President       Ashraf Ghani       and Chief Executive       Abdullah Abdullah       need to continue their efforts against corruption, which have shown gradual, modest results to date. With U.S. help, they need to reform the electoral commissions that will oversee parliamentary and presidential elections over the next two years.Then there is Pakistan, where the U.S. needs a tougher approach. Washington reduced aid to Islamabad by more than half over the past five years. More can be cut. President Trump and Congress could also designate Pakistani individuals and organizations supporting the Taliban and impose sanctions on them. The U.S. could show less restraint in striking Taliban targets within Pakistan.There are carrots available too: trade concessions, increased aid, more assistance to the Pakistani army\u2019s fight against internal extremists, dialogue with New Delhi to mitigate Pakistan\u2019s worries about India\u2019s role in Afghanistan. But these must come on the condition that Islamabad put greater pressure on the Taliban (whose headquarters is in the Quetta area) and on the Haqqani insurgent network (in North Waziristan). None of this will work unless Pakistani leaders recognize that allowing these groups\u2019 leaders sanctuary on their soil is foolish and dangerous. Given the way extremist groups collaborate in Central and South Asia, that approach will inevitably continue to backfire. After all, the greatest existential threat Pakistan faces is internal extremism, not India.President Trump\u2019s early approach holds promise. In Afghanistan today, the military needs to revisit the phase of the mission it largely skipped in the years after the surge of 2010-12 or so, when it downsized too quickly and too far. This approach will not achieve \u201cvictory\u201d in Afghanistan, after which all troops can be withdrawn. That is an impossible goal in the near-term. But it will be sustainable and it can improve the prospects of shoring up our eastern flank in the broader battle against Islamist extremism\u2014a fight that likely is to be a generational struggle.Mr. Petraeus, a retired Army general, commanded coalition forces in Iraq (2007-08) and in Afghanistan (2010-11) and later served as director of the CIA (2011-12).

If my editor is clever he will find a common theme.The first has to do with the national media climate at this time of political uncertainty, anxiety and division. I suspect at least half the country (those who support President Trump, have reserved judgment about him, or just want the news straight) feel they can no longer trust, or feel actively excluded by, mainstream entertainment and news.What we need from media folk is a kind of heroic fairness. What we have instead is endless calculation.Last week the subject was the divisive nature of so much of our entertainment culture, especially late-night talk shows.We are living in a time of the politicization of everything. You cannot, at the end of a long day, relax with a talk show because it will take a highly political point of view, in a dominant and aggressive manner, as if politics were not part of life but life. It is obnoxious and assaultive. It effectively tells the audience: \u2018We only want you here if you agree with us. If you like Donald Trump, get lost.\u201d Some news shows take a similar approach.Dislike of Mr. Trump within the mainstream media is unalterable. It permeates every network, from intern to executive producer and CEO.Here is a theory on what they\u2019re thinking: They\u2019re thinking attempts at fairness and balance in this charged atmosphere get them nowhere. They\u2019re attacked by both sides. And anyway they think Mr. Trump is insane.They live on ratings, which determine advertising rates.       Hillary Clinton       got 2.9 million more votes than Mr. Trump, so the anti-Trump audience is larger. Moreover, people who oppose Mr. Trump tend to be more affluent, more educated, more urban. They\u2019re more liberal, of course, and they\u2019re younger. They\u2019re a desirable demographic. The pro-Trump audience is more rural, more working- and middle-class, older. A particularly heartless media professional might sum them up this way: \u201cTheir next big lifestyle choice will be death.\u201dSo, if you are a person who programs or sets the tone of network fare and you want to take a side\u2014you shouldn\u2019t, but you want to!\u2014you throw your lot with the anti-Trump demo, serving them the kind of journalistic approaches and showbiz attitudes they\u2019re likely to enjoy.Mr. Trump, you are certain, won\u2019t last: He\u2019ll bring himself down or be brought down. You want to be with the winning side. So play to those who hate him, exclude others, call it integrity and reap the profits.That is my theory: media bias now is in part a financial decision, instead of what it used to be, a good old-fashioned human and institutional flaw.This contributes to public division\u2014to the great estrangement we see in America. I talk to media folk a lot, being one, and haven\u2019t found anyone who\u2019s said, \u201cWhy yes, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing, deepening our national divisions for profit!\u201d Although I shared my theory this week with a senior manager of a news organization who quickly mentioned another major news organization and said: \u201cI think that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201dBut I do think it\u2019s part of what is going on. I add only that it\u2019s not only cynical and destructive, as a business strategy it\u2019s stupid. Bias is boring. It\u2019s predictable, rote, is an audience-limiter. What has value at a time like this is playing it straight and presenting the facts. That\u2019s what they ought to do instead of taking a side.I was traveling this week for work, in Europe.When we arrived at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, passport control was closed down. Many hundreds of people milled about confusedly. An airline worker said two unattended bags had been found and security personnel were on the scene. Officials might have to explode the bags where they are. Will there be any warning? Yes, I was told, they\u2019ll tell us before and we\u2019ll hear it. Does this sort of thing happen often? \u201cA few times a day,\u201d an attendant said.There was no air of alarm, and everyone around us was pleasant. After 35 minutes passport control opened, without an explosion. The attitude was that this was par for the course, just another day at the office.Two hours after I got to my hotel, word came of a terror attack three blocks away, on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es. I asked the woman at the desk for directions and she said, in low and measured terms, \u201cI\u2019m sorry madame, there has been a terrorist occurrence. You should not go there.\u201d I said \u201cYes, I\u2019d like to go see it.\u201d She brightened: \u201cIn that case, go left, left, then final left!\u201dSoon I was in a small crowd being held back by a handful of police. They protested: My work is there. I must go there. I walked for a few blocks, to a small park off the Champs. Police had put up police tape, but as soon as they turned away people ducked under it and continued on their way.No one in the crowd\u2014workers in the shops, mothers with children, tourists\u2014seemed the least put out or concerned, never mind scared, which they were not.The next morning the story of what had happened on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es was not even the top story on the international news. Which is a wonder, since this is what happened:A man had crashed his Renault into the front car of a police convoy. The assailant was later killed. Officers searched his car and found weapons and explosives, reportedly including gas canisters, handguns and a Kalashnikov. The assailant was said to be in his early 30s, from a Parisian suburb, and known to police.A few hours later at an outdoor cafe I watched as people rode by on scooters and motorcycles. The sidewalks were busy, bright, sun-dappled at dusk. Young people were strolling by and staring down at their phones. Strolling and scrolling, all as carefree and relaxed as any other day.As I lingered over dessert. A colleague emailed an alert from a private security firm: Continue to avoid the vicinity of Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es and Avenue Montaigne. I replied: \u201cI am literally on Avenue Montaigne and nothing is happening here but bitchy gossip in the cafe.\u201d\u201cAt least you\u2019re having a very French experience then,\u201d my colleague replied.I was. Forty-eight hours later, en route to England, I saw the front page of the Times of London: A suspected terrorist had been shot and killed by soldiers in a Brussels railway station. He had attempted to detonate an explosive vest or belt. The story was illustrated with a photo of a handsome young passerby who\u2019d been staring at his phone and suddenly turned toward a flash of light behind him: the late terrorist.Nothing feels different, all looks the same, no one is letting the discomfort get in their way, but in Europe, terrorism is the new normal.And much is made of what remains of British stoicism, but something should be said for French sang-froid.My editor discerns this theme: Perhaps there is a happy medium somewhere between bitter division and blas\u00e9 complacency.", "news_time": "2017-06-22 18:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-shouts-while-europe-shrugs-1498170712", "news_title": "America Shouts While Europe Shrugs", "keywords": "political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,murder,manslaughter,terrorism,commentaries,opinions,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "In a budget proposal generating a quick rebuke on Capitol Hill, President       Trump       calls for a 22% cut to the National Institutes of Health\u2014a move that would take $7.7 billion away from research on diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer and heart disease. This is an unfortunate request. The NIH is one of our most strategically important federal assets.Rather than hacking away at the topline budget, the administration should play to the innovative strengths of NIH. This may mean a more mission-oriented approach\u2014using science to help create new sectors and fields. But it could also mean a more market-oriented approach that prioritizes the development of high-quality patents.In a new Manhattan Institute report, we find that NIH does particularly well in this regard: Its patent portfolio produces 20.4% more market value than average patents, with every $100 million in NIH funding associated with $598 million in downstream private research and development. For some of NIH\u2019s most productive programs, total downstream R&D is as high as $3.3 billion for every $100 million in grant funding.Patents aren\u2019t everything\u2014scientific knowledge is the main product of public R&D. But slashing away so much potential new technology via broad budget cuts will endanger discoveries that serve as the commercial foundation for new companies, jobs and exports in biotech and the life sciences.By contrast, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposal would provide the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency a 10% increase. If the administration likes Darpa\u2019s impressive record of radical innovation, it should love NIH\u2019s patent hubs, particularly the Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering and the Human Genome Research Institute. These two NIH programs produce twice as many direct and indirect patents as the renowned defense program.While the research community sometimes considers patents to be a \u201cless pure\u201d derivative of science, patentable discoveries have been an integral part of some of medicine\u2019s most innovative and transformative breakthroughs. Our research also shows that of NIH\u2019s 33 teams of Nobel laureates between 1990 and 2010, more than 75% patented their discoveries at a prolific rate. They weren\u2019t always blockbuster new drugs. Most of the time, new patents represent advancements that push an existing field of research forward, or allow entirely new lines of inquiry to be examined.The product of a grant from NIH\u2019s Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the \u201clab on a chip\u201d is a series of microscopic valves and tubes, which combine to create a \u201cfluidic circuit\u201d that can be used to diagnose infectious diseases quickly and cheaply. It is among the NIH innovations most cited by downstream developers in the life-science sector. The NIH\u2019s Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases invented a tiny under-the-skin sensor that continuously monitors blood-sugar levels in patients with diabetes, a big upgrade in accuracy and patient comfort.Fostering patentable innovation should appeal to President Trump. He is the only U.S. president other than       Abraham Lincoln       to have his name on a U.S. patent header. Though he wasn\u2019t the inventor, Trump Taj Mahal Associates\u2019 1996 patent for a \u201cProportional payout method for progressive linked gaming machines\u201d makes Mr. Trump, at least indirectly, the second presidential patenter.But unlike Lincoln\u2019s invention, a method of lifting boats over shoals that was cited only 10 times as prior art by subsequent inventors, the Trump Taj Mahal patent has accrued an incredible 1,066 citations. These citations are a key metric for judging economic significance and downstream impact. For someone who loves ratings, Mr. Trump must surely be pleased that his patent topped the charts.Should the president\u2019s current budget proposal pass, however, we estimate NIH\u2019s total annual patent output will fall by about 1,700. That would eat into domestic patent production by more than a full percentage point. Because patents, especially NIH\u2019s high-quality discoveries, have a direct and significant correlation to economic growth, these lost patents would be associated with nearly a quarter-point drop in GDP over the next decade. For an administration that says it wants 4% growth, every quarter-point should matter.Instead of simply cutting NIH, Congress should take a different approach: Provide sustainable support across the agency, but with modest, targeted scale-ups in NIH\u2019s patent hubs, such as the aforementioned imaging and bioengineering, basic science, and genomic institutes. A five-year growth-oriented plan along these lines would instead increase total domestic patent output. We estimate a resulting 0.22-point gain in economic growth and subsequent $800 billion in deficit reduction over 10 years.It\u2019s clear that cutting NIH funding harms growth, more than short-term budget savings could ever help to mitigate. On the other hand, investing more strategically in NIH, which produces some of the highest-quality intellectual property anywhere, could help the Trump administration meet its goals for long-term budget reduction and economic growth.Mr. Kalutkiewicz is founder of Belle+Preuve Public Affairs LLC.

That\u2019s great news for investors, who will pay less and get better returns. But it has troubling implications for corporate governance.No passive investor cares much about governance of a particular company. The impact on an index when a single company underperforms is usually either slight or offset by gains from its competitors. It may be rational for index funds to ignore governance, since the money they spend on improving it benefits not just them but also rival funds that invest in the same stocks.So it\u2019s a problem when these investors control voting outcomes for the companies that they invest in. This is often the case, since 88% of public companies count one of three large institutional investors\u2014            State Street                   Global Advisors, Vanguard, and BlackRock\u2014as their largest investor. All investors have a stake in companies being well-run, but they aren\u2019t always willing to pay higher fees for monitoring or governance. And because there is no such thing as universally good governance, the blind application of one-size-fits-all governance solutions across vastly different companies often has negative effects.So how can the law ensure that these institutions make informed decisions about corporate governance? Three approaches are possible.The first is to encourage them to rely on third-party corporate governance experts. Proxy adviser firms like ISS and Glass Lewis sell their expertise, making recommendations to investment funds about how to vote. But while outsourcing a fund\u2019s votes may be efficient in theory, academic critics have identified cases of biased and self-serving behavior on the part of these advisers. Blind reliance on third-party recommendations is increasingly viewed as an abdication of a fund\u2019s duty to act in its investors\u2019 best interest.In response to these critics, a second approach is growing in popularity: creating in-house governance teams that make recommendations to a fund\u2019s managers. Several large institutional investors now rely on these teams to prepare corporate-governance reports, issue and evaluate governance guidelines, and engage with management and the board.But there is reason to believe that these teams are not up to the task. As of October 2016, Vanguard\u2019s governance team employed 15 people to cover some 13,000 companies; BlackRock employed about 20 for its 14,000 companies; and State Street employed fewer than 10 for about 9,000 companies.The recent proxy battle for control of Arconic, a metal-parts company spun off from             Alcoa                   in 2016, illustrates the problem. Last January, the hedge fund Elliot Management Corp., which owns about 13% of Arconic, nominated new directors to Arconic\u2019s board after voicing displeasure with management\u2019s poor performance and the company\u2019s outmoded governance. Elliot took the matter to Arconic\u2019s largest institutional investors, creating a 300-page slide deck to make its case.But the governance teams at BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard reportedly refused to support Elliot\u2019s position\u2014despite contrary advice from ISS and Glass Lewis, as well as active-fund managers\u2014and instead pressured both parties to settle. It appears that the giant index-fund managers did not want to have to cast the deciding vote\u2014a vote they would be required to disclose under securities law\u2014in Elliot\u2019s favor. One reason might be that these institutions face a conflict of interest: Challenging management of a company can threaten their ability to retain that company as a client for corporate retirement fund assets.It may be necessary, therefore, for the law to create incentives for institutional investors to focus more on governance. This could be accomplished by providing a legal cause of action to shareholders that are harmed by uninformed or conflicted voting decisions. But this would be a blunt tool for curbing abuse.This leads to option three: encouraging passive institutional investors to abstain from voting altogether. The law currently pushes institutional investors to play an active role in governance. But it would be far better if passive investors, who lack the will to make informed choices and suffer from major conflicts of interest, could step out of the process. Their abstention would concentrate the voting power of active investors that have the motive and information to vote intelligently. By all accounts, if the passive institutional investors had not been in the picture, the Arconic proxy battle would have been settled months earlier, saving millions for shareholders.Reform is clearly needed, as shareholder voting has become heavily stressed by the rise of passive investing. This stress will increase as passive investing continues to surge, leading to serious problems for shareholders, employees, consumers and the economy. Passive investors should be required to become more informed\u2014using intermediaries or not\u2014or stay out of governance fights.Mr. Henderson is a professor and Ms. Lund a teaching fellow at the University of Chicago Law School.Appeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-22 18:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/index-funds-are-great-for-investors-risky-for-corporate-governance-1498170623", "news_title": "Index Funds Are Great for Investors, Risky for Corporate Governance", "keywords": "board of directors,corporate governance,index funds,passive investing,State Street,STT,management,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Alan Dershowitz        writing in the Washington Examiner, June\u00a021:My academic and political colleagues who insist that President       Trump       has obstructed justice point to his allegedly \u201ccorrupt motive\u201d in firing former FBI Director       James Comey.      \u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201cCorrupt motive\u201d is an extraordinarily vague and open-ended term that can be expanded or contracted at the whim of zealous or politically motivated prosecutors.

Spoofing is illegal if meant to defraud or cause other harm, the FCC said.FCC officials promised more action in coming months to try to help stem the flood of unwanted calls to many U.S. households, despite a proliferation of rules in recent years, such as do-not-call lists and bans on robocalls for telemarketing.Complaints have soared over telemarketing calls in the U.S. The Federal Trade Commission received about 5.3 million during 2016, compared with 3.6 million the year before. A significant number of its complaints relate to robocalls. The FCC also gets about 200,000 complaints each year relating to unwanted calls.Part of the problem, officials say, is that technology advances have made robocalls so cheap and easy to place that some marketers choose to use them, despite the legal prohibitions including \u201cDo Not Call\u201d lists. Techniques such as spoofing make the strategy more appealing, by increasing the odds that a consumer will answer. Many of the calls come from overseas.Some officials, including new FCC Chairman       Ajit Pai,        also contend that the agency hasn\u2019t prioritized the problem sufficiently. He has made robocalls the agency\u2019s top enforcement priority, according to a blog post on Thursday.In Mr. Abramovich\u2019s case, Mr. Pai said he was \u201cpleased\u201d that the agency was taking \u201cunprecedented action against what appears to be the most egregious neighbor spoofing robocalling scheme we have ever seen.\u201d The 3-member FCC unanimously approved the proposed fine at its meeting on Thursday.Mr. Abramovich didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.The calls offered consumers the opportunity to book vacation deals from well-known travel and hospitality companies such as             TripAdvisor Inc.,Expedia Inc.,Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.       and             Marriott International Inc.,       according to the FCC.The agency said TripAdvisor contacted the FCC in 2016 after receiving complaints from consumers. The company independently investigated and identified Mr. Abramovich as the source, according to the agency.In a statement, TripAdvisor Senior Vice President       Adam Medros       said the company became aware of the calls in late 2015.The calls ultimately connected consumers to call centers in Mexico that promised \u201ctoo-good-to-be-true vacation deals,\u201d he said. TripAdvisor\u2019s legal and security teams began an in-depth investigation and worked closely with the FCC for the last year.An FCC citation against Mr. Abramovich quoted several complaints to the agency from angry consumers.\u201cI\u2019m on the do-not-call list, and I get telemarketing robo-calls to my cellphone every 2 hours,\u201d one wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably infuriating.\u201dAnother wrote: \u201cI have been getting at least three or four calls a week from the last several months from these Marriott Hotel `free trip\u2019 jokers. I always hang up when I here [sic] the cheesy auto voice, but even when I miss the call I am miffed that my cellphone is getting clogged from `missed call\u2019 notifications from these scumbags! They always have the same area code and first three digits as my own cell phone. . . . PLEASE TRACK DOWN THESE JERKS!\u201dMr. Abramovich will have 30 days to respond to the commission\u2019s proposal. The FCC will consider the response and then issue any fine after that.Agency officials said the action should serve as a warning to others who are using robocall tactics that cross legal lines.The FCC will consider several changes at its July meeting that could help further.Already, the FCC recently has proposed giving telecommunications providers more leeway to block spoofed calls. That could potentially open the door to so-called do-not-originate lists that would allow carriers to prevent many fake numbers from being used.In July, the FCC also will consider whether it is possible to set up a reliable system for verifying that a phone call is really coming from the number that shows up on caller ID. That could improve the functioning of the planned do-not-originate lists.Write to John D.

Now I believe we have a responsibility to do even more,\u201d he said.Facebook executives have been contemplating the company\u2019s mission while dealing with several controversies, from criticism over its perceived role in spreading misinformation during the U.S. presidential election to its handling of violent live videos posted on the social network.Roughly four months ago, Mr. Zuckerberg posted a broad manifesto positioning Facebook as the world\u2019s \u201csocial infrastructure.\u201d He has traveled the U.S. to better understand how Facebook, founded in 2004, can help solve some of humanity\u2019s biggest problems, from terrorism to climate change.Facebook sees expanding Groups, a seven-year-old product that provides an online forum for people to discuss specific interests, as key. But the product has largely languished while other company services, such as Messenger, have racked up hundreds of millions of users.Mr. Zuckerberg has said 100 million Facebook users engage in Groups in a socially meaningful way, and that he wants to increase such membership to a billion within a few years.One goal would be to help people build more robust communities offline, which Mr. Zuckerberg believes would help reverse what he has said is declining involvement in community anchors such as schools, neighborhoods and religious institutions.\u200b\u201dMeaningful groups transcend online,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in an interview. \u201cNothing beats a face-to-face connection\u201d but online connections can fortify in-person ones, he added.Facebook is testing a \u201cgroup-to-group linking\u201d tool so administrators can recommend similar or related groups to their members. Facebook said this feature was just the beginning of how it would help bring \u201ccommunities and sub-communities closer together.\u201dSuch moves, though, could raise thorny questions about privacy and Facebook\u2019s broadening reach into its users\u2019 lives.Facebook, for example, would have to tread carefully in suggesting addiction-recovery groups to users, said Ime Archibong, Facebook\u2019s\u200bvice president of product partnerships. Another potential challenge would be an expansion of groups dedicated to hateful or difficult subject matter.Executives acknowledged many aspects of the new vision haven\u2019t been hammered out. \u201cThis is not about friends and family,\u201d said       Chris Cox,        Facebook\u2019s product chief. \u201cThis is about a different kind of issue, which is finding a common bond. It\u2019s one that for Facebook is less-charted territory.\u201dFacebook\u200boutlined a raft of new tools to help people manage those groups and grow their audience. The company also is exploring various ways for group administrators to generate revenue from managing those forums.Write to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 18:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-sets-new-vision-for-next-decade-outlines-new-features-1498148171", "news_title": "Facebook Has New Vision Beyond \u2018Connecting,\u2019 and It Thinks Groups Are Key   ", "keywords": "chicago,facebook, facebook communities summit,facebook groups, facebook group-to-group linking,mark zuckerberg,social media,Facebook,FB,Mark Zuckerberg,internet,online,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "TORONTO\u2014Warren Buffett\u2019s rescue of struggling Canadian mortgage lender             Home Capital Group Inc.        HCG 0.14%       is his latest move to secure generous returns in exchange for backing businesses that other investors are fleeing.By agreeing to provide a loan for 2.4 billion Canadian dollars ($1.8 billion) and the purchase of a minority stake in the lender, Mr.             Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.        BRK.B 0.52%       is betting against scores of bearish investors who recently sold Canadian bank stocks and shorted shares of smaller mortgage lenders amid worries about overpriced Canadian real estate.The deal, announced Wednesday night, provided a much-needed boost to Home Capital. Director       Alan Hibben       said in an interview that the board weighed several financing offers, but it opted for Mr. Buffett\u2019s because it brought the kind of \u201cpay attention\u201d backing the company needed to restore confidence after a devastating deposit flight.\u201cHe\u2019s the best hope of getting that validation,\u201d Mr. Hibben said.Talks were initiated after Mr. Buffett was approached by Home Capital\u2019s bankers, the director said.Berkshire has long benefited from Mr. Buffett\u2019s reputation as a skilled judge of businesses who is known for closing deals quickly without teams of bankers or consultants. Berkshire earned more than $10 billion on deals Mr. Buffett struck during and after the financial crisis with blue-chip companies including             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,Dow Chemical Co.      ,             General Electric Co.       and             Bank of America Corp.The deal with Home Capital was another bold move, because some analysts have said that if Canada\u2019s real estate bubble bursts, midsize lenders like Home Capital could be the among the most vulnerable to losses.Berkshire secured generous terms, getting a nearly 40% stake at a steep discount. Mr. Buffett\u2019s company also agreed to extend a C$2 billion line of credit at a rate of 9.5%, as well as 1.75% standby fee on undrawn funds.Berkshire held $96.5 billion in cash as of March 31, and Mr. Buffett has been looking for ways to spend it. The recent deal offers Berkshire attractive returns and demonstrates \u201cthe benefit of having that kind of cash available a phone call away,\u201d said       Thomas Russo,        partner at Gardner Russo & Gardner, which manages $10 billion and holds Berkshire shares.Home Capital\u2019s stock soared Thursday, rising 27% to C$19 a share, its highest level since April when it was hit with the deposit exodus.The Berkshire investment comes as governments in Ontario and British Columbia have taken steps to restrain housing speculation, slowing the pace of house sales in the two provinces\u2019 largest cities. Earlier this month, Bank of Canada Gov.       Stephen Poloz       sought to quell concerns that Home Capital\u2019s problems reflected an underlying malaise in Canada\u2019s mortgage-finance system, saying its issues were due to \u201cfirm-specific factors.\u201dHome Capital is one of Canada\u2019s largest mortgage lenders to higher risk borrowers, many of them immigrants or self employed workers who have poor ratings or scarce credit history. The lender relies primarily on independent brokers to underwrite its mortgages and it terminated more than 40 brokers in 2014 after it discovered the incomes of borrowers hadn\u2019t been verified.Home Capital experienced a dramatic outflow of about 95% of its more than C$2 billion high interest savings deposits in April and May after Canada\u2019s leading securities regulator alleged the company and three executives materially misled investors about the full extent of the mortgage fraud problem.The company and the executives last week struck settlements, without admitting wrong doing, to pay C$29.5 million in penalties and other payments to the regulator and shareholders.Berkshire said it would acquire a minority stake in Home Capital for about C$400 million through two private placements at an average price of C$10 a share, 33% less than \u200bthe company\u2019s C$14.94 closing share price on Wednesday.The initial purchase of a 20% stake, set to close June 29, calls for Home Capital to issue new shares for C$153 million, or C$9.55 a share. The company said the purchase amounts to a 20% discount to the weighted-average price for the 20 days before the announcement. The stock purchase isn\u2019t subject to a shareholder vote because Toronto Stock Exchange rules allow buyers to bypass it at a time of financial hardship.Berkshire agreed to purchase an additional 24 million shares for C$246.8 million, or about C$10.30 a share. This investment will be subject to shareholder approval at a special meeting in September.When the purchases are complete, Berkshire said it would only vote 25% of its Home Capital stock, to comply with Canadian regulations that restrict investors from voting more than 25% of bank shares.\u2014Vipal Monga contributed to this article.Write to Jacquie McNish at Jacquie.McNish@wsj.com and Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Berkshire Rescues Mortgage Lender.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 18:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canadas-home-capital-seeks-to-further-shrink-debt-following-rescue-by-berkshire-hathaway-1498143787", "news_title": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Rescues Canada\u2019s Home Capital", "keywords": "berkshire hathaway investments,canada home prices,canada real estate,canadian mortgage lender ,home capital common stock.,home capital debt,home capital deposit flight,home capital exodus,rescue,Berkshire Hathaway,BRKA,Home Capital Group,HCG.T,3G Capital,Warren Buffett,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,personal finance,credit types,services,mortgages,real estate credit,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,banking,credit,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "The Trump administration said it would remove\u00a0endangered species protections for the Yellowstone grizzly bear, in a move initiated by\u00a0the Obama administration after numbers of the West\u2019s largest land predator rebounded sharply over the past four decades.The move, criticized by environmentalists, paves the way for grizzly-hunting to resume in some places after a 40-year ban.Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park had plummeted to as few as 136 by 1975, when they were listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.Because of a\u00a0ban on hunting and other protections, the number of grizzlies in a Greater Yellowstone ecosystem that includes parts of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming have increased more than fivefold to an estimated 700,\u00a0according to the Interior Department.The federal government aimed to boost the population to 500 grizzlies.\u00a0The animal can weigh up to 600 pounds.Interior Secretary       Ryan Zinke,        a former Montana congressman who announced the delisting\u00a0Thursday, hailed the recovery as one of the nation\u2019s greatest conservation success stories.\u201cAs a kid who grew up in Montana, I can tell you that this is a long time coming and very good news for many communities and advocates in the Yellowstone region,\u201d Mr. Zinke said in a statement.Environmental groups condemned the move, and vowed to try to fight it in the courts.Lawsuits filed by environmentalists succeeded in blocking efforts by the Bush administration to delist the grizzly in 2007, when their numbers already were considered recovered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.Environmentalists say\u00a0grizzlies have a slow reproduction rate and would be imperiled from hunting and other dangers.Once the rule by the Fish and Wildlife Service takes effect later\u00a0this year, states will regain their authority to resume trophy hunts that have been banned for 40 years.The grizzlies would remain protected from hunting in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks.\u201cThis premature decision to remove endangered-species protections could set grizzly recovery back by decades,\u201d       Michael Brune,        executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement. \u201cThe end result will be fewer bears restricted to an even smaller area.\u201dSupporters of the delisting, though, say there are so many Yellowstone grizzlies that conflicts with humans have increased as well as attacks on livestock. \u201cGrizzly bears have met or exceeded recovery objectives since 2003 and have long warranted delisting,\u201d Wyoming Gov.       Matt Mead       said in a statement.The Wyoming governor, among other Westerners, asked the Obama administration to resume the delisting process. In 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service issued a draft notice to take the bears off the list, as states including Wyoming gave assurances they would continue to manage the grizzlies so their numbers remain healthy.The debate over grizzlies is reminiscent of the one over the gray wolf, another iconic predator that was reintroduced to Yellowstone in 1995 under endangered species protection.But as the number of wolves exploded, they were delisted in Idaho and Montana.Write to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 17:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/grizzly-bears-to-come-off-endangered-list-1498168743", "news_title": "Grizzly Bears to Come Off Endangered List ", "keywords": "endangered species act,grizzly bears,grizzly bears yellowstone,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,Ryan Zinke,Matt Mead,Michael Brune,corporate changes,stock listings,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,natural environment,hunting,environmental protection,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "Mayor       Bill de Blasio      \ufeff\u2019s       administration laid out its plan to close the Rikers Island jail complex\u00a0on Thursday, saying doing so would take at least a decade.The proposal primarily relies on reducing the city\u2019s jail population from a daily total of 9,400 today to 5,000. Officials said they would accomplish this by helping people pay bail, reducing the number of inmates with mental illnesses and speeding up case-processing.Closing Rikers would require building new jails in the boroughs, officials said.\u201cThis plan will not be easy,\u201d a city report detailing the proposal said. \u201cHistorically, community opposition, land-use requirements, and the high cost of acquiring and developing new land have prevented the city from siting new jails or even expanding existing jails. And it will not be fast.\u201dThe city wants to close Rikers and build jails that are \u201csmaller, safer and fairer\u201d in locations that would help inmates maintain community ties. Rikers\u2014a 400-acre island complex located in the East River between the boroughs of Queens and the Bronx\u2014is far from courthouses and many inmates\u2019 families.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said\u00a0Thursday on radio station WNYC, that City Council members should allow jails to be built in their districts. \u201cAll of it is theoretical,\u201d he said, \u201cunless a council member comes forward.\u201dStaten Island wasn\u2019t included in the plan, he said, because it has a small population of inmates, and officials don\u2019t want a jail in their borough.Council Member       Stephen Levin,        whose downtown Brooklyn district already has a jail, said neither Mr. de Blasio nor anyone in his administration had reached out to him about expanding that facility or building another one.Mr. Levin, a Democrat, said he had received one complaint about the Brooklyn House of Detention, a jail in his district. \u201cIt\u2019s not a credible argument to say there\u2019s a negative impact on the community,\u201d he said.In April, an independent commission, led by New York state former Chief Judge       Jonathan Lippman       and convened by City Council Speaker       Melissa Mark-Viverito,        released its own recommendations for closing Rikers Island, which it said would cost more than $10 billion over 10 years. The city report says it \u201cbuilds upon the work of many,\u201d including that of the independent commission. The plan also includes improving current conditions at Rikers Island jails.Critics have called the mayor\u2019s timeline too long.       Glenn Martin,        a leader of the #CLOSErikers campaign, said many of those held now at Rikers \u201cface routine human-rights abuses.\u201d\u201cMany of the barriers to speedy closure are not questions of feasibility or affordability, but of political will, and thus far the mayor has been nothing short of unwilling,\u201d he said in a statement on Thursday.A City Hall spokeswoman declined to comment.

HAIN 4.01%       released on Thursday a year\u2019s worth of quarterly and annual financial reports, and revised multiple reports dating back to 2014.Hain, whose declining sales in the U.S. continued a drumbeat of bad news for food makers, had failed to release timely earnings after it identified revenue irregularities in prior statements. On Thursday, it said that it found no intentional wrongdoing and no material revisions were needed to the old reports.The Long Island, N.Y., company, also named a new chief financial officer and launched a $250 million stock-buyback program.Hain, which has said it is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, faced potential delisting from Nasdaq if it didn\u2019t report its financial results by June 30. The company also had a Thursday deadline to deliver financial statements to lenders, or potentially default on its credit agreement.The company said the audit committee from its board worked with independent counsel to review the financial statements, spurred by concerns on whether revenue associated with concessions to distributors was being recorded in the correct period. In total, the erroneously recorded revenue boosted Hain\u2019s earnings by about $44.7 million.

It also would eliminate the requirement in the 2010 law that most Americans sign up for health insurance, and provide instead less-robust tax credits than the ACA to help people afford insurance. It would repeal hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes on businesses and high-income households and retroactively cut taxes on capital gains.The Senate plan in many ways echoes a health bill passed by the House last month, but it contains several differences. It isn\u2019t clear if those changes, such as the shape of the tax credits and a more gradual phasing-out of the Medicaid expansion, would be enough to attract more centrist Republicans without alienating the most conservative lawmakers in both chambers.The challenge quickly became evident when four GOP senators\u2014Ted Cruz of Texas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah and       Rand Paul       of Kentucky\u2014said they couldn\u2019t vote for the bill as it stood, though they were open to negotiation.A more centrist GOP senator, Dean Heller of Nevada, who faces re-election next year, said he had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the bill, particularly its effect on Medicaid recipients.With 52 Republican senators, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can lose no more than two GOP votes for the bill to pass under a special process tied to the budget.Thursday\u2019s release of the 142-page bill, after its elements had been closely held by GOP leaders, launched a fast-moving process that top Republicans hope will culminate in a new health law\u2019s passage possibly before Congress\u2019s August recess. Senate GOP leaders say they plan to vote next week; if the bill passes, then the House could take it up, or the two chambers could try to reach a compromise on the two bills.The Senate bill, mirroring its House counterpart, keeps some of the ACA\u2019s provisions in place, like the tax credits to subsidize health coverage. But it would shift the income eligibility and some of the structure for those credits, which in some cases could reduce their size for older Americans, in particular.In other areas the bill takes fuller aim at the ACA, former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       signature law. The enhanced federal funding the 2010 law provided for states to expand Medicaid would be phased out starting in 2021 and eliminated by 2024. States could still keep the expansion, but they wouldn\u2019t get the additional federal funds.Beyond that expansion, federal funding for Medicaid would be capped for the first time. States would be given a choice on whether they would prefer block grants or a per-capita payment for beneficiaries.In 2025, the bill would lower the growth rate for Medicaid spending, a move that alarmed some centrist Republicans. \u201cThat translates into literally billions of dollars, and it would result in states either cutting back on eligibility or rural hospitals going under because of uncompensated care,\u201d said Sen.       Susan Collins       of Maine. \u201cThose are serious problems.\u201dAmong Republicans\u2019 loudest complaints about the ACA, sometimes called Obamacare, was that it imposed several new taxes, and the GOP push would undo most of them.Like the House bill, the Senate bill would repeal a 3.8% tax on investment income retroactively to January 2017 and delay the repeal of a 0.9% payroll tax until 2023. Both of those taxes only apply to individuals making more than $200,000 and married couples making more than $250,000. A tax on generous employer health plans, which has yet to go into effect, would remain but be further delayed, until 2026.Democrats criticized the bill for curbing Medicaid funding while repealing taxes on the wealthy, and referred to President       Donald Trump\u2019s       recent characterization of the House version of the bill as \u201cmean.\u201d\u201cThe House and Senate bills should be known as \u2018mean\u2019 and \u2018meaner,\u2019 \u201d said Sen.       Ron Wyden       (D., Ore.). \u201cRepublicans will keep telling Americans they\u2019re fixing their health care right up until the minute it\u2019s taken away.\u201dGOP leaders were quick to note that the text was subject to change.\u201cRight now we\u2019ve got members who are going to be interested in seeing it, digesting it, and then looking to see if there are things we can do to refine it, make it more acceptable to more members in our conference to get to 50\u201d votes, said Sen.       John Thune       (R., S.D.).In particular, Republicans may seek to \u201cdial\u201d the levels up or down on the tax credits and phase-out of the enhanced funding for Medicaid expansion, Mr. Thune said.Other Republicans, like Mr. Paul, said the law didn\u2019t go far enough in repealing the ACA, and the Kentucky senator said he didn\u2019t favor the government subsidizing the cost of health insurance.\u201cThe bill needs to look more like repeal of Obamacare, and less like we\u2019re keeping Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Paul said.If the Senate splits 50-50, Vice President       Mike Pence       would break the tie.Mr. McConnell has set a rapid-fire timeline for passage. An analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, laying out the bill\u2019s effect on cost and coverage, could come as early as Monday. Senate Republicans plan to vote on the bill days later, and then it would be taken up by the House.The CBO report on the House bill showed it would leave 23 million more people uninsured while reducing the cumulative federal deficit by $119 billion in the next decade compared with current law.House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.) declined to discuss the Senate bill\u2019s prospects in the House Thursday. At the White House, Mr. Trump said he hoped the Senate would pass a health bill \u201cwith heart\u201d and that he was pleased with the legislation unveiled earlier in the day.Mr. Trump was heavily engaged in pushing the health bill through the House, sometimes dialing lawmakers late into the night. He has taken a more hands-off approach with the Senate, but a senior White House official said that could change.Mr. Obama, in a post on Facebook Thursday, urged Republicans and Democrats to work together on a health bill but said the Senate\u2019s proposal would harm many Americans.\u201cSimply put, if there\u2019s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family\u2014this bill will do you harm,\u201d he said in the post.Under the bill, states would get billions more in funding largely to help stabilize markets for insurance bought on exchanges that were set up under the ACA.

The deal also paves the way for the cable operator\u2019s U.S. expansion.Patrick Drahi,        the French billionaire who founded Altice, has spent the past two decades building a cable empire that spans from Israel to the Dominican Republic. Altice USA was formed last year through the merger of Cablevision Systems Corp. and Suddenlink Communications. Its initial public offering raises funds that could be used to expand an operator that is present in 21 states and serves 4.9 million customers, according to a regulatory filing.When asked Thursday about the newly public company\u2019s plans for deal making, Altice USA Chief Executive       Dexter Goei       said that expanding in cable would be more of a focus in the short term than investing in wireless. \u201cWe like to grow through acquisitions,\u201d Mr. Goei said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be reactive to opportunities that arise but we don\u2019t know what those are going to be,\u201d he said.Altice faces a tough test in the U.S., where competition is stiff. A move away from traditional TV services toward internet streaming has led to a wave of consolidation in the U.S. cable industry. At the same time, cable companies including             Comcast Corp.       and             Charter Communications Inc.       have been making moves to get a piece of the wireless phone-service business.The S&P 500\u2019s telecom sector fell less than 0.1% during Thursday\u2019s session and is down nearly 12% so far this year.When Altice USA was pitching its IPO to potential investors recently, executives were pressed about the company\u2019s plan to convert its systems into an ultrafast fiber-to-the-home network and the cost savings that it still expects to wring from merging Cablevision with Suddenlink, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s roadshow.Mr. Goei also said Thursday that the company plans to spend some of the IPO proceeds to pay down some of Altice USA\u2019s more expensive debt. Wednesday\u2019s offering raised $1.9 billion for the company and selling shareholders, making Altice the biggest U.S.-listed telecom IPO in roughly 17 years and one of the biggest overall this year, according to data provider Dealogic.Messrs. Drahi, Goei and other company executives gathered at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday morning \u200bfor Altice USA\u2019s first day of trading. They rang the opening bell and applause broke out on the NYSE \u200bfloor as shares began trading at 10:18 a.m. ET at $31.60 a share, a day after Altice USA priced its shares at $30.Altice\u2019s first-day pop in share price was bigger than the 7% average for companies that have gone public in the U.S. this year through Wednesday, according to Dealogic.The IPO was led by J.P.

It means the sanctions, which were due to expire at the end of July, 2017, will now continue until at least January 2018.\u201cAgreed. EU will extend economic sanctions against Russia for their lack of implementing the Minsk Agreement,\u201d European Council President Donald Tusk said on Twitter.EU and Russian officials say the sanctions, which curtail defense, energy and financial ties, have harmed the Russian economy\u2014though Russia\u2019s economy appears to be adapting.The EU and the U.S. have linked the economic sanctions to the February 2015 Minsk cease-fire accord, which aimed to end fighting between Ukraine\u2019s forces and Russia-backed separatists. Progress on the agreement has stalled, European diplomats say, meaning there was little real debate about sticking to the course and extending the sanctions.The EU has also placed a travel ban and an asset freeze on 37 businesses and 150 people, including top aides to Mr. Putin, over the conflict in eastern Ukraine. On Monday it extended for a year sanctions linked to Russia\u2019s March 2014 annexation of Crimea.Russia\u2019s economy in 2014 entered a two-year recession, sparked by sanctions and plunging oil prices, but the World Bank forecasts it to grow 1.3% this year.The European move comes as the U.S. senate last week backed a bill that would impose new sanctions on Russians linked to human-rights abuses, arms sales to Syria and cyberattacks. The measures also curtailed President       Donald Trump\u2019s       ability to ease sanctions, something he floated doing during the presidential campaign, causing consternation in the EU.In a paper circulated last week, seen by The Wall Street Journal, the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive, said its sanctions are still denting Russian imports of dual use goods and placing pressure on Russia\u2019s financial sector, though the commission acknowledged easier foreign funding conditions for Russian companies in recent months.The bloc also said Russian counter-sanctions\u2014mainly on EU agricultural products\u2014was having only a minimal impact on the EU\u2019s economy. It said the combined effect of the EU\u2019s sanctions on Russia and the Russian countermeasures would have zero impact on EU economic output in 2017, after having a 0.1% drag in 2016.Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 17:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-leaders-reach-political-deal-to-extend-sanctions-on-russia-1498168032", "news_title": "EU Leaders Reach Political Deal to Extend Sanctions on Russia ", "keywords": "cease-fire,crimea,european commission,extend,minsk,minsk agreement,russian government,sanctions,ukraine,European Commission,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers"}, {"content": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s annual stress-test of banks showed that credit cards have moved to the top of the list of concerns about potential losses.Banks would incur $100 billion in projected credit card losses in a severely adverse hypothetical recession calculated by the Fed in Thursday\u2019s test, the first part of a two-stage exam that will culminate next week in large banks being told by the regulator whether they can proceed with dividend and share-buyback plans.Thursday\u2019s test made cards the top category for losses, tied with commercial and industrial loans. On last year\u2019s test, the Fed crunched projected card losses of $92 billion, ranking cards third in losses after trading and counterparty losses and commercial and industrial loans.Card defaults, which had fallen in recent years to record low territory, are now on the rise, and concern is growing among investors in the credit card market that more losses are on the way. Credit card balances are rising at an accelerating pace industrywide and recently surpassed $1 trillion, the first breach into this territory since the beginning of the last recession.The Fed said several factors contributed to credit card losses rising in its latest test. Consumer defaults generally increase when unemployment rises, one of the factors in the Fed\u2019s severely adverse scenario. Missed payments on cards have been on the rise at many banks in recent quarters, and credit card loan growth continues to rise.In the Fed\u2019s severely adverse scenario,             Capital One Financial Corp.\u2019s       credit card losses would be $21.7 billion, compared with $18 billion last year.             Discover Financial Services                  \u2019 would be $8.7 billion versus $7.6 billion last year.             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co.\u2019s card losses would be at $15.7 billion, compared with $13.9 billion last year.Looser lending standards are also contributing to rising card losses. Card issuance to consumers with lower credit scores has been on the rise in recent years as lenders have been searching for larger returns and competition for prime consumers has intensified. Subprime card loans outgrew prime card loans for eight straight quarters through March 2017, according to a report by Autonomous Research.

The Senate proposal could change before it is voted on, which leaders hope will be late next week, but the basic elements are likely to remain.Helping the UninsuredWhat the ACA does: People who don\u2019t get insurance on the job can get tax credits to offset their premiums, and in some cases to lower their out-of-pocket costs, for plans purchased on the insurance exchanges. The credits take into account income, age and the local cost of insurance.What the House bill would do: People without employer-sponsored coverage can get tax credits, but they would vary largely based on age. For many people, the credits would be smaller than under the ACA. Individuals can use the credits for plans sold anywhere, not just on the exchanges.What the Senate bill would do: The Senate\u2019s approach is closer to the ACA\u2019s. The tax credits would be larger for people with low incomes, those who live in areas with high medical costs, or older Americans. As in the House bill, many people would get smaller tax credits than under the ACA.MedicaidWhat the ACA does: The law provides enhanced federal funding to states that expand Medicaid eligibility for residents up to 133% of the poverty level. About 14 million new enrollees have been added as 31 states and the District of Columbia expanded that eligibility, with states picking up very little of the cost.What the House bill would do: The Medicaid expansion would freeze in 2020, becoming limited to current enrollees. States would have to make up the difference in cost if they wanted to maintain the expansion for new enrollees.Funding for the broader Medicaid program would change from a guaranteed matching-fund system to either a block grant or a per capita cap. The result would be 14 million fewer Medicaid beneficiaries through 2026, compared with the ACA, according to the Congressional Budget Office.What the Senate bill would do: Enhanced federal funding for the expansion would roll back over three years, beginning in 2021. States could choose between block grants or per capita caps, but both options would curb their overall federal Medicaid funding. States could add a requirement that some people must work to get Medicaid.TaxesWhat the ACA does: Obamacare, as it is known, imposed a number of taxes to help fund health-insurance subsidies. These include a tax on health insurers, a so-called Cadillac tax on generous employer health plans (which has been delayed), a medical-device tax and a tax on individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year.What the House bill would do: The majority of the ACA\u2019s taxes would be repealed, amounting to more than $590 billion in tax cuts over the next 10 years. The bill does retain the much-debated Cadillac tax, but delays its implementation until 2026.What the Senate bill would do: The bill also knocks down many of the ACA\u2019s taxes, including a 3.8% tax on investment income. The Cadillac tax would be retained but wouldn\u2019t go into effect until 2026. It would end a tax on indoor tanning, repeal limits on contributions to flexible-spending accounts and stop taxes on health-insurance premiums.The tax on medical devices would also be repealed.Insurance RulesWhat the ACA does: Most health-insurance plans in the small group and individual market must cover 10 benefit categories that include hospitalization, maternity care and mental health. People with pre-existing health conditions can\u2019t be denied coverage or charged higher premiums. Insures can\u2019t charge older adults more than three times the premium amount charged to younger people.What the House bill would do: States could get waivers allowing them to roll back the 10 required benefits. States could also use waivers to let insurers charge older adults premiums five times higher than younger people. Other waivers would let insurers temporarily charge people with pre-existing health conditions higher premiums if they let their coverage lapse. At the same time, states would get $138 billion over 10 years for policies that help people with expensive conditions afford premiums.What the Senate bill would do: Insurers would still have to cover people with pre-existing conditions without charging them higher premiums, though people who let their coverage lapse would have to wait six months before getting coverage. The bill sets aside money for states that pursue waivers through the Department of Health and Human Services. These waivers would let them roll back ACA regulations, including the 10 required health benefits.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'How Bills Compare With Obamacare.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 17:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-senate-health-bill-likely-differs-from-house-bill-obamacare-1498074220", "news_title": "How the Senate Health Bill Differs From House Bill, Obamacare ", "keywords": "aca, aca,affordable care act, conservatives, health bill, health insurance,health law, insurance exchanges,obamacare, preexisting conditions, republicans,senate health bill,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"}, {"content": "The Senate GOP\u2019s health-care bill would offer $2 billion for opioid addiction treatment for one year, falling short of the $45 billion over 10 years some Republican senators wanted.The funding\u2019s inclusion in the Senate version of the health-care overhaul comes after weeks of protest from House and Senate Republicans who feared steep cuts to Medicaid would worsen an already growing opioid crisis, with Sens.

Here is a partial transcript of the interview, lightly edited for clarity and length.NICK TIMIRAOS: To start, just to go back to the decision last week\u2026do you think it was the right move to raise rates in June, or was it a mistake?JAMES BULLARD: Well, I guess what I feel on this is that the rate increase is not such a big problem, but the projection of 200 more basis points of rate increases in this kind of environment I think is unnecessarily aggressive. And so if it had just been, you know, the rate rise at that meeting, I think I could have gone along with the chair. But the trajectory that the committee has laid out seems to me to be inappropriate given the situation that we\u2019re in.MR. TIMIRAOS: And what about the situation makes the trajectory inappropriate?MR. BULLARD: Well, we\u2019ve been talking about this regime-based view of U.S. macroeconomic situation\u2014the U.S. macroeconomic situation\u2014and that has served us pretty well over the last year. We said growth is\u2014you know, has been about 2%, is unlikely to deviate very much from 2% over the forecast horizon. That\u2019s turned out to be true. The inflation numbers have been creeping up toward 2%. Now they\u2019ve come back down a little bit. Inflation expectations have come down a little bit. But still, I think that the general picture that you\u2019re more or less in a low-growth, low interest rate, low-inflation regime has been a good way to think about the U.S. economy. It\u2019s not that it couldn\u2019t get better in the future. It could. But for now, given what we know and given the fundamentals of the U.S. economy, I think the best way to make monetary policy is to wait and see what happens.MR. TIMIRAOS: I hear concerns about falling behind the curve. Why are those concerns overrated?MR. BULLARD: The estimates of the effects of low unemployment on inflation are very small. And so I think even if unemployment went down well into the 3% range, we\u2019d get probably very little impact on inflation. So I think the idea that inflation\u2019s just around the corner because the unemployment rate\u2019s low is faulty. And even if that did occur, at these\u2014you know, inflation\u2019s still below target today by the committee\u2019s preferred measure, so you\u2019d just be moving a little bit closer to target based on that.MR. TIMIRAOS: So do you think the Fed can keep justifying rate increases without more evidence of inflation nearing 2%?MR. BULLARD: I think it would be tough in this environment. The inflation numbers have not been very good this spring. They\u2019ve surprised to the downside. I would interpret them as relatively broad-based. I\u2019m open to the idea that maybe there was just some noise in there\u2014that\u2019s possible. But it looks more broad-based to me. And now, with other corroborating factors like the 10-year [Treasury yield] coming down to low levels, oil prices falling, it just doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s a lot of price pressure building up. So, again, I feel like the level of rates that we\u2019re at now is very reasonable, and we could just tell the world that we think we\u2019re OK for now and we\u2019ll see how things develop in the future.MR. TIMIRAOS: So how does the balance sheet plan fit into all of this? Because the idea there should be to tighten conditions a little bit by raising long-term rates. How do you think about the sequencing of a balance sheet unwind?MR. BULLARD: I\u2019ve been an advocate of getting started on balance sheet reduction. We\u2019re going to do it in a very controlled and passive way that I think will be easy for markets to digest, and so I\u2019m not expecting anything too dramatic. But I think it is important to create some policy space for the future. You know, someday\u2014I\u2019m not predicting this, but someday, you know, we may get hit by a big shock, and we may want to have easier monetary policy, and we\u2019d like to have quantitative easing as one of the possibilities in that circumstance. So, for that, I think you should be allowing the balance sheet to fall during relative good times, and then you create some policy space for the future.I also think that the whole idea of raising the policy rate is that all rates are supposed to go up in tandem. That\u2019s not happening right now, and partly it\u2019s not happening because we\u2019ve got\u2014we\u2019ve got the big balance sheet that, according to our rhetoric, is putting downward pressure on longer-term rates. So we\u2019re kind of operating at cross purposes here. If we\u2019re trying to raise the policy rate, we should be releasing pressure on the longer end of the yield curve. And so, now that we\u2019ve made three policy moves here in the last seven months, the policy rate is probably appropriate to release some of the pressure on the longer-term part of the yield curve.MR. TIMIRAOS: Are you surprised there hasn\u2019t been more reaction in the bond market, in financial markets to the decisions that have been telegraphed?MR. BULLARD: What do you mean?MR. TIMIRAOS: Well, you have basically announced the balance sheet plan, and it doesn\u2019t seem as if there\u2019s been much of a reaction, for better or for worse, but really for better, I think, in this case.MR. BULLARD: I think that the amounts that we\u2019re talking about, certainly initially, are so small that compared to all the other things that go on in global bond markets, it\u2019s pretty\u2014it\u2019s pretty small. And also, we haven\u2019t actually done it yet, so\u2014and we haven\u2019t announced the start date. So that\u2019s a decision that will probably come later this year, but we\u2019ll see. And so I just think, you know, at the scale of things that happen in global bond markets, this is probably not going to be that big of a thing.MR. TIMIRAOS: Right. So people talk about the taper tantrum as\u2014that was also policy that hadn\u2019t really been announced, but once markets got a sense of it, they reacted.MR. BULLARD: The taper tantrum was in June 2013. I actually dissented at that meeting. We were announcing\u2014it was a communications problem. We were announcing that we might do something with the balance sheet in the future. We weren\u2019t being very precise about what we might do. It was not expected in markets at all. And I think it\u2019s that combination of events that caused the actual taper tantrum. So we didn\u2019t actually do anything at the June 2013 meeting; we talked about things. And then, at the September meeting, we again didn\u2019t do anything; we talked about things, and everything calmed down. At the December meeting in 2013, when we actually did something, it was a very calm reaction. Nothing happened. And, in fact, we continued with the taper for all of 2014. So I think it\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s a lesson, to me, that it\u2019s all about communication, and the actual amounts that we were talking about weren\u2019t necessarily what was causing the problem.MR. TIMIRAOS: And so do you think the leadership learned the right lessons, then, from that and has applied them in the current circumstance?MR. EVANS: Yeah. I think we\u2019ve been much better here about being deliberate about our\u2014how we\u2019re going to handle balance sheet runoff and being very careful about it. And we\u2019ve had broad discussions at the FOMC which have been reported in the minutes, and now we\u2019ve come out with a statement about how we\u2019re going to do it even before we\u2019re actually going to implement the plan. So I think the communications piece has gone very well this time.MR. TIMIRAOS: Do you have any thinking on when it should go into effect? Some people have said once [the Fed explains its balance sheet plan], it doesn\u2019t make sense to wait too many meetings. Do you share that view, that now that the details are out there you might as well turn the key?MR. BULLARD: Well, I\u2019d prefer to get moving sooner rather than later. We\u2019ve outlined an approach that is going to be very much a go-slow approach, and so I think we could start the ball rolling. It\u2019s going to roll very slowly anyway. And the idea is to get the process going so that you\u2019re building policy space for the future in case you need it, but you\u2019re doing it in a way that\u2019s not disruptive to financial markets. And so, you know, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve\u2014you know, I actually suggested that we start reducing the size of the balance sheet before we come off the zero bound, so I\u2019m kind of in the camp of, you know, this seems very late to me to get going on this process. But now that we\u2019ve got our plan out, I think we could announce it at some point, yeah.MR. TIMIRAOS: And just in terms of kind of the technical operation, does it make sense to have any period of time in between when it\u2019s announced and when it actually takes effect? Is that a day, a week, a month?MR. BULLARD: I would go with the advice of the\u2014of the Open Market Desk on that. You know, it\u2019s possible you want to prepare a little bit or that operationally it would make some difference. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s critically important, but we could\u2014we could adjust that as the committee saw fit.\u2026Another thing is I\u2019ve got policy advice sitting there that says the policy rate is basically where it needs to be already, and so I don\u2019t have this upward-sloping thing. I\u2019ve got a flat. So the only thing left to do is normalize the balance sheet. There isn\u2019t anything left to do, in my view, which is different from the rest of the committee, so.MR. TIMIRAOS: And then it seems like the endpoint for the balance sheet is something that\u2019s been kind of left up as a future discussion, in part because you have to suck some reserves out of the system before you will know what the optimal size is. But how much debate has there been yet around what that kind of terminal size of the balance sheet should be?MR. BULLARD: Yeah, I\u2019ve always found this argument a little bit kind of mildly comical because, you know, suppose you\u2019re going to lose a lot of weight, and then you say, well, I can\u2019t start losing weight until I know exactly what my final weight is going to be. I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s\u2014I mean, what we know is that the endpoint is going to be quite a bit lower than where we are today, and therefore I think you can get going and you\u2019ll have years\u2014you\u2019ll have a couple years before you have to decide what the final answer will be on this.You know, estimates I\u2019ve seen are that, over the next\u2014whenever this starts, over the first three years you probably run about $1.2 trillion off, something like that, $400 billion a year. So you\u2019d still be at, you know, almost $3 trillion by the time you got done with that process, or maybe higher than that. I\u2019m not quite sure I\u2019ve got the numbers right. But anyway, it\u2019s\u2014you got plenty of time to decide the final size of the balance sheet and the final operating system.MR. TIMIRAOS: Congress has to raise the debt limit at some point. They often wait until the last minute, and that last minute looks like it\u2019s going to be sometime in September. Do you think their ability or inability to have a collision there would change\u2014would force the committee at all to consider its sequencing of this?MR. BULLARD: I actually don\u2019t think they\u2019re linked that closely, and I think we could probably just go ahead. I\u2019d certainly be careful about it. I would want to see what was happening. But, you know, the truth is there\u2019s a lot of noise about the debt ceiling, but it eventually gets done one way or another. Even if you have a government shutdown for a period of time, it still gets done. So I don\u2019t see them as so closely linked. And also, we can adjust the start date, so we could make a decision in that\u2014in that time frame and push the start date off to somewhere where the debt ceiling isn\u2019t an issue\u2026.MR. TIMIRAOS: Let me move to the economy\u2026. Why do you think such a low unemployment rate has done so little for inflation?MR. BULLARD: Yeah, I mean, I\u2019ve never been a Phillips curve advocate. I\u2019ve never thought it was a good theory. I\u2019ve often thought it\u2019s been overemphasized. And I think it\u2019s been made disprovable, unprovable, or a theory that you cannot disprove because every time the unemployment rate keeps coming down and inflation doesn\u2019t do anything, then we adjust the natural rate of unemployment. So that\u2019s, like, a free parameter that always makes the theory be right. But I don\u2019t think you can treat your theories that way. You have to at some point accept the evidence that maybe this isn\u2019t the right way to think about\u2014to think about inflation\u2026. And in models that we have, the linkage, the feedback from labor markets toward inflation would be there, but it would be very weak, according to the models as well. And so I kind of take those\u2014both the empirical side and the theoretical side to tell me that I shouldn\u2019t be taking so many signals from\u2014you know, directly from reading the unemployment rate.MR. TIMIRAOS: Sometimes the other argument I hear is that, well, the last time the unemployment got this low we had financial imbalances, we had asset bubbles. How concerned are you that that might manifest itself again, now that we\u2019re at 4.3% unemployment and could be there for a while?MR. BULLARD: I\u2019m more sympathetic to that argument. And I think if people want to make that argument, they should just make it directly. I think my colleague, [Boston Fed President]       Eric Rosengren,        is one that\u2019s talked about commercial real estate and other factors that he\u2019s concerned about. And, you know, I think it\u2019s fair to say that the way the U.S. economy has worked in the last 25 years, it has not been a case where inflation gets out of control and then the Fed has to get inflation back under control a la Volcker. That has not been the story in the last 25 years. The story has been inflation has remained basically low and stable throughout the period. But instead, we got asset price bubbles that burst and caused recessions.And so I\u2019m sympathetic to that argument, but I don\u2019t see anything right now that would be on the same level as the internet boom in the \u201990s or the housing boom in the mid-2000s. But, you know, I am sympathetic, so I do pay attention to this. I know a lot of people are talking about equity prices. Some people are talking about other segments of the economy and so on. So I do pay attention to it and I am sympathetic to it, but I just\u2014I just don\u2019t see anything right now that I think monetary policy could affect and that would have a big impact on the economy\u2026. So, I mean, people talk about tech stocks, for instance, which seem to have tremendous value\u2014some of which seem to have tremendous valuations. But, you know, that\u2019s a story about, well, what\u2019s the future of American industry? What\u2019s the future of technology? And I don\u2019t have any more insight into that than anyone else.MR. TIMIRAOS: Some people are saying that it\u2019s time to rethink the inflation target. Would a higher inflation target up until now have helped get us any closer to more inflation?MR. BULLARD: You know, I have to laugh, there\u2019s a huge literature on the optimal rate of inflation, which I\u2019ve worked on myself. So it\u2019s not that it hasn\u2019t been thought about. I think 2% is an international standard. It came out of a lot of analysis in the \u201990s, especially as the European Central Bank was being established. And you had other countries that were leaders, like New Zealand, the U.K. And now it\u2019s been adopted more or less around the world as a\u2014as a standard. So there was a lot of thinking that went into this or went behind it. You could re-examine it. And I\u2019d be open to that. And there is an ongoing literature. But all the same arguments are going to come up again about why we came up with the number that we did.Also, I think if you go to a higher inflation target, you have to accept higher interest rates\u2014higher nominal interest rates all the time. And I\u2019m not sure most people are really ready to do that, to live in a high nominal interest rate world all the time just so that you can reduce nominal interest rates in some occasions. So there\u2019s a sort of distortion that goes on in the economy every day because of these\u2014because of high nominal interest rates that penalize the economy every day in exchange for being able to lower rates in certain situations.So I\u2019m\u2014I think we could re-examine it, but I wouldn\u2019t\u2014and Canada has done this. And I think what they did was admirable. They put it on a regular schedule. And that kind of thing I think we could do and would be reasonable. But knowing how the literature works and knowing what the arguments are, I think it\u2019s unlikely to come to a different conclusion than the one that was come\u2014had been developed over past decades\u2026.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 17:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-feds-bullard-on-inflation-interest-rates-balance-sheet-1498166612", "news_title": "Transcript: Fed\u2019s Bullard on Inflation, Interest Rates, Balance Sheet", "keywords": "central bank,exclusive interview,federal reserve board,fomc,increase,inflation,interest rates,portfolio,raising rates,st. louis fed,taper tantrum,unemployment,yield curve,Federal Reserve,James\u00a0Bullard,economic performance,indicators,prices,monetary policy,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,interviews,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "This year\u2019s bank stress tests turned up an unpleasant surprise for             Goldman Sachs        GS -0.20%       and             Morgan Stanley.        MS 3.28%These two investment banks scored low on a metric introduced for the first time this year, the supplementary leverage ratio, or SLR. This ratio is meant to measure banks\u2019 total leverage, including off-balance sheet exposures.In the Fed\u2019s most dire hypothetical scenario, which includes a deep U.S. recession, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley would see this ratio fall to 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively. Those are the lowest levels of any bank, and also disconcertingly close to the 3% minimum.It isn\u2019t surprising that these banks would be more constrained by this new ratio. Their large trading operations carry with them certain off-balance-sheet exposures, such as repo transactions and over-the-counter derivatives, that aren\u2019t captured in the other metrics.The next step in the stress test process happens next week when the banks ask the Federal Reserve for approval to return cash to shareholders. If Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are considered by the Fed to be too close to failing the SLR test, regulators might limit how much they can pay out.For investors, that could make for a disappointing outcome, particularly for Morgan Stanley, which shareholders have hoped would significantly boost capital returns this year. The Trump administration has proposed to ease leverage rules, but that won\u2019t help the banks this year.The point of the annual stress tests is to keep banks on their toes, forcing them to constantly re-evaluate how much capital they would need under various scenarios.

The holdouts said the deal breaches the terms of their loan agreement for the benefit of J.Crew\u2019s shareholders.Under the proposed deleveraging deal, bondholders would exchange their claims at a discount for equity and new longer-term debt backed by a claim on J.Crew\u2019s intellectual property, such as its brand name. Higher-ranking lenders were required to sign off on the transaction and accept the company\u2019s right to pledge the brands as collateral for the new bonds.A J.Crew spokeswoman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.J.Crew had laid the groundwork for the transaction by moving the intellectual property in December to a new subsidiary beyond the grasp of its lenders. J.Crew then sued its lenders in a pre-emptive move aimed at preventing a potential default declaration. Brand assets valued by the company at $250 million were moved to an unrestricted subsidiary that wasn\u2019t bound by the company\u2019s existing borrowing terms.But by this week, lenders holding 88% of its loan debt had given their consent to the deal thanks to incentives offered for them to drop the litigation, according to the company.The proposal, if executed, would buy J.Crew\u2019s incoming Chief Executive       James Brett       another two years to turn around the business. Earlier in June, the company said longtime CEO       Mickey Drexler      would step down in favor of an outsider, while remaining chairman of the board.Mr. Drexler is one of the company\u2019s largest shareholders along with private-equity firms TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, which took J.Crew private in 2011. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in June, Mr. Drexler said the company would begin emphasizing lower prices, invest in digital marketing and adopt a more accessible image.The rise of online shopping means fewer shoppers are visiting malls, taking a toll on retailers big and small. Mall anchors such as             Macy\u2019s Inc.,Sears Holding Corp.       and             J.C. Penney Co.       have announced closures of hundreds of store locations since August.A number of smaller chains such as Wet Seal, The Limited and American Apparel have filed for chapter 11 and moved to sell their brand names after no buyers or investors stepped forward to keep their stores open.In April, J.Crew announced 250 job cuts, primarily from its corporate headquarters, and said it would part ways with       Jenna Lyons,        its longtime creative chief. J.Crew has about 600 stores, a smaller footprint than many other chains.The retailer\u2019s total revenue fell 6% to $532 million in the latest quarter and its net loss was $123.3 million.

Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, said that as analysis of the bill gets under way, the rights of Americans opposed to abortion must be protected.\u201cReplacing Obamacare with health care that respects both life and the constitutional rights of all Americans is a pro-life necessity,\u201d she said.The Susan B. Anthony List, a group that supports antiabortion candidates for federal office, didn\u2019t immediately respond to the Senate bill. But in a letter to lawmakers earlier this month, the group said the Planned Parenthood and abortion restrictions \"are essential to the bill, and must be retained all the way to final passage.\u201dThe two provisions are likely necessary to maintain backing for the health bill from influential groups like the National Right to life Committee, which maintains a scorecard for members of Congress based on their abortion-related votes.Defunding Planned Parenthood has long been a goal for these groups and for many conservative lawmakers, and they view the health bill as a rare opportunity to do so. Republicans plan to use a procedural maneuver to pass the bill with a simple 51-vote majority in the Senate rather than the 60 votes usually required, making passage easier.Republicans who favor the defunding measure say that although the law already says federal dollars cannot pay for abortions, Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal support helps the nonprofit group stay in operation.Supporters of Planned Parenthood say barring the organization from the Medicaid program would force low-income women to pay out-of-pocket for unrelated, important services like health screenings and contraception. About 60% of Planned Parenthood\u2019s patients receive services through Medicaid and other federal programs.The measures\u2019 inclusion also threatens to divide the 52 Senate Republicans. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) can lose no more than two GOP lawmakers, with Vice President       Mike Pence       breaking a 50-50 tie. But passage remained uncertain Thursday, as four Republican senators indicated they weren\u2019t ready to sign the bill as written.The challenge for Mr. McConnell is that while the Planned Parenthood and abortion provisions are important to conservatives, they are objectionable to centrist Republicans.Sen.       Susan Collins       of Maine has said she plans to introduce an amendment to strip the defunding measure out of the bill, an effort Alaska Sen.       Lisa Murkowski       is expected to support. It is unclear whether the two lawmakers would oppose the broader bill if that amendment fails,\u201cI am opposed to the defunding of Planned Parenthood,\u201d Ms. Collins said Thursday. \"I think it\u2019s unfair and shortsighted to take one provider out of the Medicaid program. There already is a ban on the use of federal funds for abortions.\u201dAs for the abortion restrictions on tax credits, it isn\u2019t clear whether they are permissible under the procedural rules Mr. McConnell is using to advance the bill. Sen.       Ted Cruz       (R., Texas) has said the bill would be \u201cvery problematic\u201d without the restrictions in place.Write to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 17:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/planned-parenthood-restriction-could-pose-problem-for-centrist-senators-1498165754", "news_title": "Planned Parenthood Restriction Could Pose Problem for Centrist Senators", "keywords": "repeal obamacare,senate health bill,tax cuts for the one percent,tax cuts for the rich,unaffordable care act,Planned Parenthood Federation of America,Congressional Budget Office,The Senate,Lisa Murkowski,Cecile Richards,Susan Collins,abortion,political,general news,society,community,ethical issues,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,medical treatments,procedures,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"}, {"content": "A weakened tropical depression Cindy swept inland over Louisiana on Thursday afternoon but continued to threaten the Southeast with tornadoes and potentially fatal flash flooding from heavy rains.The storm already claimed one life Wednesday: a 10-year-old boy who was vacationing with his family in Fort Morgan, Ala.

Steve Arthur       of the Baldwin County Sheriff\u2019s Office.Cindy made landfall as a tropical storm between Cameron, La., and Port Arthur, Texas, early Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Its center was about 165 miles northwest of Morgan City, La., and moving north before an expected turn east toward Arkansas and Tennessee on Friday.Officials across the Gulf Coast cautioned that flooding and tornadoes remained a threat.

Parts of her story later unraveled and she was stripped of citizenship after admitting she covered up her husband\u2019s service in a Bosnian Serb army unit that massacred 8,000 Bosnian Muslim civilians at Srebrenica in 1995.Applicants for citizenship must possess \u201cgood moral character,\u201d and the government argued that accurate information regarding her husband\u2019s activities would have affected the decision to grant Mrs. Maslenjak citizenship. But at her trial for procuring citizenship illegally, the jury was instructed that any lie, even if it wasn\u2019t \u201cmaterial\u201d and \u201cdid not influence the decision to approve [her] naturalization\u201d was sufficient for conviction.The Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati upheld the conviction, putting it in conflict with federal appeals courts in Boston; Chicago; Richmond, Va., and San Francisco, all of which had ruled that a challenged misrepresentation must be relevant to the naturalization decision.The government\u2019s broad claim, under which lying about ever having driven over the speed limit theoretically could cost an immigrant her citizenship, clearly troubled the justices at argument in April. Thursday\u2019s decision against the government was unanimous.The ruling will give greater security to \u201cmillions of naturalized Americans,\u201d said Christopher Landau, the attorney who argued Mrs. Maslenjak\u2019s case. \u201cNaturalized citizenship is not second-class citizenship, and a naturalized citizen is as much of an American as one whose forebears arrived on the Mayflower.\u201dMrs. Maslenjak, 54 years old, and her husband were deported last year to Serbia, Mr. Landau said. She \u201cnow looks forward to the opportunity to reclaim her citizenship under the correct legal standard,\u201d he said.A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.Chief Justice       John Roberts       and Justices Anthony Kennedy,       Ruth Bader Ginsburg,        Stephen Breyer and       Sonia Sotomayor       joined the Kagan opinion. Justice Samuel Alito agreed with the result but wrote separately to argue the government should get more leeway in defining material statements.The newest justice, Donald Trump appointee       Neil Gorsuch,        joined part of the court\u2019s opinion but wrote separately to chide the majority for going beyond the bare ruling to provide lower courts guidance in handling similar cases in the future.\u201cRespectfully, it seems to me at least reasonably possible that the crucible of adversarial testing on which we usually depend, along with the experience of our thoughtful colleagues on the district and circuit benches, could yield insights (or reveal pitfalls) we cannot muster guided only by our own lights,\u201d Justice Gorsuch wrote, joined by Justice       Clarence Thomas.In two separate cases, the court upheld murder convictions despite evidence of at least technical violations of the defendants\u2019 constitutional rights.Seven defendants convicted in 1985 of robbing and murdering a Washington, D.C., woman, Catherine Fuller, argued that police had withheld exculpatory evidence during their trial, violating Brady v. Maryland, a 1963 precedent requiring the government to disclose material evidence favorable to the defense case.The evidence, discovered years after the trial, included witness interviews suggesting that a single culprit, rather than a group, had attacked Ms. Fuller. Writing for the court, Justice Breyer noted that under current D.C. policies, such evidence would have been given to the defense. But by a 6-2 vote, the court found the newly uncovered evidence was insufficient to have affected the outcome.The court, voting 7-2, also upheld a 2006 murder conviction from Boston even though the public was excluded from attending the two-day jury selection.Writing for the court, Justice Kennedy said the claim may have succeeded had it been raised earlier in the appeals process as a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial. Instead, however, for procedural reasons, Kentel Weaver, convicted of killing a fellow teenager, Germaine Rucker, appealed on the grounds that his lawyer was ineffective for failing to challenge excluding the public at trial.\u201cIn the criminal justice system, the constant, indeed unending, duty of the judiciary is to seek and to find the proper balance between the necessity for fair and just trials and the importance of finality of judgments,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote.

The states help finance Medicaid and are already squeezed, she said, and if the proposed federal cutbacks occur they would likely need to reduce eligibility and shrink payments to health-care providers under their Medicaid programs.Georges Benjamin,        executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the bill \u201cwould devastate the Medicaid program.\u201dLike the bill earlier passed by Republicans in the House, the Senate bill would likely lead to an overall reduction in the number of people with health coverage, said       Larry Levitt,        a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cBy 2026, there will be substantially fewer people covered by Medicaid,\u201d he said, adding that the number of people enrolled in individual insurance would also likely shrink eventually.The Catholic Health Association of the United States, a trade group of more than 2,000 Catholic hospitals, clinics and nursing homes, said it strongly opposed the Senate bill.\u201cAfter weeks of working behind closed doors, and despite claims that the Senate would start over and develop its own legislation, there is very little that differs from the House bill,\u201d said Sister       Carol Keehan,        president and CEO of the trade group. She said she had hoped for a different outcome \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t optimistic at all.\u201dThe Senate bill makes a key tweak in the methodology the House bill used to set federal payments for Medicaid, which could lead to even lower federal funding levels than those contemplated in the House bill, said       John Baackes,        chief executive of L.A. Care Health Plan, which largely focuses on Medicaid.Mr. Baackes said he considered the Senate bill \u201cin the long run, substantially worse\u201d than the House bill because it ultimately imposes a greater financial burden on states\u2014which he said they are unlikely to be able to pay. The upshot, he suggested, might be that health-care providers, facing even lower reimbursement rates, will drop out of Medicaid.Hospitals that have served the Affordable Care Act\u2019s newly insured Medicaid patients would likely see pressure on margins as the number of uninsured people rises, demand declines and losses from unpaid medical bills increase, said       Kevin Holloran,        a health-care analyst with Fitch Ratings.Some stocks of hospital companies and Medicaid-focused insurers, including             Molina Healthcare Inc.       and             Centene Corp.      , rose after the bill\u2019s release. Analysts said the movement implied that investors thought the bill wasn\u2019t as bad for companies as they had feared, or believed it faces big barriers to quick passage.The Senate bill would take longer than the House bill to unwind the ACA Medicaid expansion, raising the prospect that \u201cthe most significant coverage cuts may never go into effect post the 2020 election,\u201d       Michael Newshel,        a health-care facility analyst with Evercore ISI, said. Control of Congress could swing with the election, he said, or Republicans could even reverse the cuts down the road if the political consequences seem too severe.For health insurers, the bill\u2019s major changes to the consumer insurance markets are likely to be a mixed bag, with its ultimate effects far from certain. The bill ends enforcement of the current mandate for individuals to have insurance\u2014a provision many insurers see as an important mechanism for keeping young, healthy people in the market. On the upside for insurers, it preserves, for the next two years, federal payments to insurers that reduce costs for low-income people enrolled in individual plans\u2014a key guarantee that insurers have said is vital for stabilizing unsteady markets next year.The bill also includes funding that is supposed to be used to help steady the insurance marketplaces, which could blunt insurers\u2019 costs for the sickest enrollees, another goal of an insurance industry that has struggled with losses in existing ACA exchanges because of higher-than-expected costs. Industry officials said the money could be an important prop for the markets for as long as it is available.Ending enforcement of the coverage mandate with no replacement provision to prod healthy people into the market \u201cwould be a very big problem\u201d and have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d in pushing up premiums, said Alan Murray, chief executive of CareConnect, a New York insurer and a unit of Northwell Health. But locking in the short-term federal cost-sharing payments, and the new stabilization money, \u201cmay help balance the bill,\u201d he said.\u201cYou have to have some mechanism that is more assured to keep people in continuous coverage and entice young people\u201d into the market, said Diane P. Holder, chief executive of UPMC Health Plan. The Senate bill\u2019s changes to the federal subsidies, along with a tweak to how premiums are tied to age, means \u201cpoorer people and older people are disproportionately hurt.\u201dThe Senate bill ends the ACA\u2019s health-insurance tax, which had been suspended for this year but was slated to go back into effect next year. Industry officials applauded that move.\u201cFor the industry as a whole, it\u2019s an important repeal,\u201d said       Bruce Broussard,        chief executive of             Humana Inc.       The tax has been a pass-through that raised premiums for customers, he said.Appeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Health Sector Assesses New Risks.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 16:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-bill-poses-risks-to-health-care-companies-1498165128", "news_title": "Senate Bill Poses Risks to Health-Care Companies ", "keywords": " health insurance,medicaid,senate health-care bill,Centene,CNC,Humana,HUM,Molina Healthcare,MOH,regulation,government policy,government aid,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services,government sponsored health insurance"}, {"content": "The dollar edged lower Thursday, pausing from a rally that drove the currency to a one-month high this week as investors watch speeches from Federal Reserve officials.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, was down 0.1% to 88.83.

This is inexcusable and shocking behavior,\u201d he said.The archbishop had ordered an independent review of the church\u2019s handling of the case, chaired by       Dame Moira Gibb,        a former London public official with a background in social work.The report found that the church\u2019s attitude to homosexuality at the time played a role in its failure to act appropriately, and that it \u201ctrivialized\u201d the alleged behavior.Many of the victims, the report said, were vulnerable and sought spiritual guidance from Mr. Ball.\u00a0One victim, who first came forward in 1992, said\u00a0he was\u00a0asked to conduct \u201cspiritual exercises\u201d that involved being naked and taking cold showers, the report said.After stepping down after a 1992 allegation and a caution from police, Mr. Ball continued to give speeches at 17 schools and to carry out sacraments, the report said.\u00a0Police reopened an investigation into him in 2012 following a new allegation of abuse.The report found that       George Carey,        who served as archbishop of Canterbury\u00a0from 1991 to 2002, received seven letters in 1992 and 1993 from young men or parents alleging improper conduct by Mr. Ball, but the archbishop failed to pass all but one on to police.Mr. Carey has said he was preoccupied at the time with the possibility of a schism in the Church of England, which had just voted to ordain women, as well as with the divorce of       Prince Charles       from his wife, Diana.Mr. Carey said in a statement Thursday that the report \u201cmakes deeply uncomfortable reading\u201d and that he \u201cgave too little credence to the vulnerable young men and boys behind the allegations.\u201dMr. Carey\u00a0also stepped back from public ministry Thursday, the bishop of Oxford said in a statement.Mr. Ball could not be reached for comment.The Most Rev.

Mr. Coury, Mylan\u2019s former chief executive, received nearly $100 million in 2016, when the company ignited a public furor over hefty price increases on its lifesaving EpiPen allergy treatment.The institutions also urged Mylan shareholders to reject the company\u2019s executive compensation plans because they say directors repeatedly approve \u201cexcessive pay\u201d for top officers.The campaign represented more of a high-profile protest than a serious threat to Mylan directors, since all six directors ran unopposed.New York City and New York state pension funds plus the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System and PGGM, a Dutch pension fund, signed the letter.In a statement Thursday the opposition group led by New York City Comptroller       Scott M.

The plaintiffs include members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, ministers, a church, LGBT-advocacy group Campaign for Southern Equality and the Mississippi Center for Justice.The plaintiffs \u201chave not shown an injury-in-fact caused by HB 1523 that would empower the district court or this court to rule on its constitutionality,\u201d wrote Circuit Judge Jerry Smith in the unanimous ruling of the three-judge panel.The judges said the potential for future injuries can sometimes justify standing in a case, but it requires plaintiffs to show that they face an immediate danger of suffering a concrete harm. The injuries alleged were too speculative, the court said.The law stops the state from punishing Mississippians\u2014including license-issuing clerks or wedding planners\u2014who refused to provide service based on believing marriage is between a man and a woman, sexual relations \u201care properly reserved to such a marriage,\u201d and that \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d refer to sex as determined at birth.Opponents of the law argued that Thursday\u2019s ruling means LGBT people living in Mississippi are now subject to harm. Robert McDuff, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, said they plan to seek further review, \u201cperhaps from the full Fifth Circuit and definitely from the United States Supreme Court.\u201d\u201cPeople should not have to live through discrimination in order to challenge this obviously unconstitutional bill,\u201d Mr. McDuff said in a statement. In the ruling last year, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves said the law violated the guarantee of religious neutrality and the promise of equal protection of the law.The Campaign for Southern Equality said the law doesn\u2019t go into effect right away, and that the preliminary injunction blocking the law is still in place until the court issues a formal mandate. That could happen in mid-July unless they agree to an en banc review by all of the court\u2019s judges, a spokesman for the group said.At the time the law was passed, the Mississippi Economic Council, the state\u2019s chamber of commerce, and Nissan North America Inc., which operates an assembly plant in Canton, Miss., also raised objections.Proponents including Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, have argued the measure is intended to protect rights.\u201cAs I have said all along, the legislation is not meant to discriminate against anyone, but simply prevents government interference with the constitutional right to exercise sincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d Mr. Bryant said in a statement Thursday.Mississippi\u2019s Republican House Speaker Philip Gunn, the bill\u2019s primary sponsor, issued a two-sentence statement after the decision: \u201cThe whole objective was to protect religious freedoms. We are pleased to see that is now in effect.\u201dThe state\u2019s Republican-led legislature passed the law in April 2016 in response to the prior-year Supreme Court ruling backing same-sex marriage. The law\u2019s backers said it would protect religious freedom without blocking same-sex marriages, since clerks who refused to issue a marriage license were required to make sure a legally valid marriage wasn\u2019t \u201cimpeded or delayed\u201d as a result.\u2014Jacob Gershman contributed to this articleWrite to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.com and Cameron McWhirter at cameron.mcwhirter@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 16:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-appeals-court-reverses-ruling-on-mississippi-religious-objections-law-1498163910", "news_title": "Federal Appeals Court Reverses Ruling on Mississippi \u2018Religious Objections\u2019 Law ", "keywords": "hb 1523,lgbt,mississippi economic council,religious objections,political,general news,crime,legal action,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,sexuality,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "An internal investigation at             Hain Celestial Group        HAIN 4.01%       found past errors in its accounting were immaterial. Investors care more about the company\u2019s future, which still looks troubled.The maker of natural and organic foods said Thursday it had completed a long-awaited accounting review and had determined there was no need to restate its financials. Instead, Hain issued \u201crevised\u201d revenue and earnings figures for fiscal years 2012 through 2015, as well as the first nine months of fiscal 2016. The company, which averted a delisting from the Nasdaq by submitting its annual filing for fiscal 2016, also announced the replacement of its chief financial officer.Hain highlighted the small revisions in recent periods as evidence the changes were minor. In total, the erroneously recorded revenue boosted Hain\u2019s earnings by a total of about $44.7 million. That includes a $14 million boost between 2014 and 2016, with the remaining $30.7 million coming in the periods before that. Hain\u2019s revenue was $2.9 billion in 2016.Hain\u2019s argument that the revisions weren\u2019t material may hold water for the recent periods: they only lowered earnings by 1.2% in fiscal 2015 and by 0.8% in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2014 and 2013, however, they lowered earnings by a more material 7% and 10%, respectively. Hain didn\u2019t provide a breakdown of revised results for years before fiscal 2012. In total, the revisions lowered retained earnings by 5.5% through the end of 2015.That, coupled with Hain\u2019s weak 2017 financial results, could further undermine investor confidence in the company\u2019s management. Shares fell more than 3% Thursday morning, recovering later in the day.For the first nine months of fiscal 2017, Hain\u2019s revenue is down about 1%, with sales in its U.S. segment down by 6.4%. The company\u2019s net income is down by half, hurt by higher expenses, including a $20 million charge related to the accounting review.There is some subjectivity involved in determining materiality. Generally speaking, it depends on whether a reasonable investor would consider the information important enough to affect his or her decision to buy the stock. Companies sometimes use a rule of thumb such as 10% of revenue or 5% of earnings, but qualitative factors can also affect their decisions. Regulators have said a relatively small error could be material if it results in higher compensation for management, among other things.Some Hain investors are claiming just that. The company faces multiple shareholder lawsuits alleging false or misleading statements by management, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment, according to its annual filing. Hain is also being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Investors looking for a deal on the grocery aisle can find healthier options elsewhere.Write to Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 16:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/immaterial-revision-or-not-hain-still-has-problems-1498162172", "news_title": "\u2019Immaterial\u2019 Revision or Not, Hain Still has Problems ", "keywords": "earnings,herbal tea,immaterial,investors,lowered earnings,revision,sleepy time tea,Hain Celestial Group,HAIN,commodity,financial market news,food,beverages,tobacco,consumer goods,food products"}, {"content": "Resolving the political impasse between Mexico and the U.S. over a border wall requires innovative thinking. How about this: Presidents       Donald Trump       and       Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto       should work together to construct a \u201csolar wall\u201d\u2014a massive string of photovoltaic panels\u2014on the Mexican side of the border. Building on our previous research,       Homero Aridjis       and       James Ramey      proposed the idea late last year. After studying the concept, we have concluded that the idea is not only technically and economically feasible, it might even be more practical than a traditional wall.Why build in Mexico? Lower costs south of the border would greatly reduce the overall price tag. We estimate that building a roughly 2,000-mile-long single-row solar wall would cost less than $1 billion, plus site preparation costs such as fencing and road construction. Compare that with Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, which could cost tens of billions of dollars.Mexico\u2019s solar-power potential also ranks among the highest on the planet. As Messrs. Aridjis and Ramey point out, its high central plateau deserts have a \u201cdry, unclouded, low-latitude and relatively cool climate\u201d that is perfect for photovoltaics. We calculate that one string of solar panels would have a power capacity of 0.8 gigawatts and could produce about 2,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity a year. Add three rows in parallel, and that would cost $3 billion while producing some 8,000 gigawatt-hours annually.That\u2019s enough energy to power about half a million homes in the U.S.\u2014or far more in Mexico. Some of these costs could be offset by private investors, who would have a strong incentive to partake in what would be a wildly profitable venture. Property owners along the border could also see new streams of income.The project would present some difficulties for engineers. Normally solar fields are built in multi-row arrays, which form a rectangle. This would require long, skinny arrays that would be less efficient. But such technical challenges aren\u2019t insurmountable.Could such a wall secure the border? People can bypass any kind of border, whether it is constructed of concrete or solar panels, and this would not be a fortress-like barrier to illegal entry. Yet a solar wall would place more people, surveillance and physical infrastructure at what is now a largely deserted, lawless and dangerous part of North America. And unlike the monolithic wall Mr. Trump is proposing, it would be a beautiful structure. The burden of protecting the solar wall could be split between federal security forces and private power companies.Regarding politics: Even without buy-in from Mr. Trump, the Mexican president could pursue this wall on his own territory, with financing from private investors. This would put a positive spin on Mr. Trump\u2019s idea of a structure to divide the two countries. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto could invite his northern neighbors to take part in the initiative, or Mexico could simply reap the financial and environmental benefits for itself.No doubt it would be better if Presidents Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto came together and embraced this creative governance idea. In taking advantage of the fact that America and Mexico share one planet and one sun, they could use this opportunity to create a wall that unites rather than divides.Mr. Fthenakis is director of the Center for Life Cycle Analysis at Columbia University, where he is also a professor.

Are those shorts or seaworthy boy-brief bottoms? When studying the spring 2017 runway collections, it\u2019s often difficult to tell.Indeed, the line between swimwear and ready-to-wear has blurred this season. Designers sent out aquatically inclined pieces tucked into pants or layered under tunics as if to say that water isn\u2019t really swimwear\u2019s natural habitat.But is wearing a bikini as a top a faux pas? Not to       Miuccia Prada       who, for both her Miu Miu and Prada collections, tipped her swim cap to the dolce vita era with an offering of retro suits layered with blouses and skirts. Inspired by the look of swim,       Joseph Altuzarra       served up beachy ruffled bralettes with high-waisted skirts, while Tory Burch showed maxi skirts with bikini-like silk bralettes, which she later modified for retail into bona fide swimwear.Translating the runway to the real world, however, can be tricky, but when done right, this trend can squeeze more value from your summer wardrobe. \u201cI think that people like the multiple uses,\u201d said designer       Lisa Marie Fernandez,        who has championed the concept since launching her swimwear and resort brand in 2009. \u201cThe bikini is no longer just a bikini. The one-piece is also a bodysuit.\u201d She helped pioneer the idea of making bikinis and maillots from denim, seersucker and crepe, fabrics which easily transition from seaside to sidewalk. And yes, you can actually swim in them.Elyse Walker, owner of eponymous boutiques in Newport Beach and Pacific Palisades, Calif., recommends wearing ruffled bikini tops\u2014like those from Ms. Fernandez\u2014with wide trousers or full skirts that are high-waisted enough to expose just a sliver of midriff. Scoopy one-pieces, meanwhile, are easily tucked into high-rise jeans. A customer \u201cmight buy a bikini for a trip to St. Bart\u2019s, but then she can also [wear the top] to dinner in the Hamptons,\u201d said Ms. Walker. Call it investment dressing. Her other favored brands for souped-up swim are Australian label Zimmerman and New York designer Jonathan Simkhai, who recently added bathing suits to his collection.To find a swim top you can elevate to regular-top status, pay attention to fabric and silhouette. \u201cI feel like the vintage-inspired styles really work best,\u201d said New York fashion stylist       Ann Caruso.       Those 1950s-style fuller-cut tops and bottoms not only offer more cover, they\u2019re also more fashion-forward. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t really do the string bikini top,\u201d she added. Search out structured shapes in rich-feeling fabrics, and restrict swimwear made of very basic Lycra to the pool and shore, said Ms. Fernandez. She uses a substantial matte neoprene even for her simplest styles.\u2018\u2018The bikini is no longer just a bikini. The one-piece is also a bodysuit.\u2019\u2019Another tip from Ms. Fernandez: Take care that you\u2019re appropriately covered when taking your swimwear out on the town. \u201cIf you\u2019re showing shoulder and you have a crop top, balance it with a trouser or skirt with a little length to it,\u201d she said. The designer added skirts and dresses to her collection in 2015\u2014taking some of the guesswork out of swim-to-street ensembles. If you really want a no-brainer solution, she recently launched a mini collection of coordinated swim-and-skirt/dress ensembles with e-commerce site Matches Fashion.New York designer Joseph Altuzarra showcased other charming layering approaches in his collection, putting floral bikini-inspired bralettes under striped off-the-shoulder knit dresses so that only the ruffled straps peeked out. Elsewhere, he paired a cherry-print skirt with a matching bralette and finished it with a blazer. Result: a look both festive and almost formal.Mr. Altuzarra advocates wearing swimwear with a silk shirtdress, either unbuttoning the dress from the neck to show off a bikini top or from the bottom to flash a pair of boy-cut briefs. Throw on a belt and wedge sandals to pull it all together. \u201cBefore, you\u2019d have your city clothes then your holiday pieces on the side,\u201d said Ms. Fernandez. \u201cNow it\u2019s more about lifestyle clothes.

The plan operates like the 2010 Affordable Care Act, but in reverse. Instead of raising taxes to pay for expanded insurance coverage, it reduces coverage and cuts taxes.\u201cIt\u2019s very important that we repeal these taxes as quickly as possible,\u201d said Sen.       Pat Toomey       (R., Pa.) \u201cThese taxes are doing damage to our economy.\u201dThe taxes it would remove were created to pay for Obamacare. The most notable is a 3.8% tax on investment income, including capital gains and dividends. The tax only applies to individuals with incomes exceeding $200,000 and married couples making more than $250,000.Like in the House bill, that tax would be repealed as of Jan. 1, 2017, dropping the top capital-gains tax rate to 20% from 23.8%. Under that measure, people who sold assets earlier this year, even before they knew if the tax cut would happen, would benefit. Retroactive tax cuts like this don\u2019t create an incentive and can yield windfall gains for people who already made decisions.Someone who recorded a $1 million capital gain on a stock sale in January would get a $38,000 tax cut as a result of the bill.\u201cThis specific tax break highlights how the Republicans\u2019 bill is a reward for the fortunate few at the expense of millions of hardworking Americans,\u201d said Sen.       Ron Wyden       of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cBy making this tax cut retroactive, Republicans are being wholly transparent in handing the elite a massive giveaway.\u201dSenators had discussed delaying some of the tax cuts, which would create budgetary room in the bill to pay for health-insurance coverage. This draft doesn\u2019t do much of that, but it allows Republicans to find money over the next week by proposing delays, which could pay for changes that could win over wavering senators. On the other hand, delaying tax cuts could erode support in the conservative wing of the party.Capital gains and other investment income are concentrated at the top of the income distribution. More than 60% of that tax cut would go to the top 0.1% of the population, according to the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.A separate 0.9% payroll tax, which also only applies to high-income households, would remain in place until 2023, just as in the House bill.Republicans say Obamacare\u2019s taxes have harmed the economy, and they have promised to repeal them all, rather than leave some in place to pay for health coverage.Democrats blasted the plan and have been saying for weeks that the GOP\u2019s plans were largely designed to cut taxes and not improve health care.Congressional scorekeepers haven\u2019t released estimates of the Senate plan yet and won\u2019t do so until early next week. The House bill included $663 billion in tax cuts over a decade, plus hundreds of billions of dollars more in lower taxes embedded in health-insurance provisions.The proposal would repeal other taxes created as part of Obamacare, some of which reach beyond high-income households. They include a tax on indoor tanning, limits on contributions to flexible-spending accounts, higher limits on deductible medical expenses, taxes on pharmaceutical companies and health insurance premiums and an excise tax on medical devices.The plan would also repeal, starting in 2017, a rule that prevents health-insurance companies from deducting more than $500,000 for the compensation of their top executives.The so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance wouldn\u2019t take effect until 2026. Keeping that tax in place in the future would help the bill comply with Senate rules that forbid the legislation from increasing budget deficits beyond the 10-year budget-scoring window.Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 15:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-health-bill-gives-huge-tax-cuts-to-businesses-high-income-households-1498151061", "news_title": "Senate Health Bill Gives Huge Tax Cuts to Businesses, High-Income Households ", "keywords": "capital-gains taxes,donald trump,gop health plan,health-care news,health-care overhaul,health law,obamacare,senate health plan,tax,tax news,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services"}, {"content": "U.S. government bonds eked out some price gains Thursday with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling to near its 2017 low.Traders said lower government bond yields in Germany dragged down U.S. yields. Treasury debt continues to offer more attractive yields than government bonds in many developed countries, which has played a big role in holding U.S. long-term government bond yields at very low levels from a historical standpoint over the past few years.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.153%, compared with 2.156% Wednesday. The yield\u2019s closing low in 2017 was 2.138% on June 14. Yields fall as bond prices rise.Thursday\u2019s highlight was a $5 billion sale of 30-year Treasury inflation-protected security that drew the strongest demand since 2011.The strong result surprised some traders and analysts because this asset class has been taking a beating lately due to softening consumer-price index reports in the U.S. and weaker energy prices.The value of TIPS will be adjusted higher when inflation readings are on the rise, making them a popular vehicle for investors for inflation protection.Some analysts say buyers deem the recent selloff has turned TIPS into an attractive bargain.Debate on inflation has been heating up lately, especially after Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       last week said that slowing inflation data could be noisy and that a robust labor market may eventually push up inflation.\u201cThere is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook and TIPS are a little bit more attractive here,\u2019\u2019 said Dan Heckman, senior fixed-income strategist at U.S. Bancorp Wealth Management.Mr. Heckman said the auction also appeals to investors looking for long-dated high quality assets to match their obligations such as pension funds.Demand for long-dated bonds has been robust because large bond buying from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan continue to shrink the pool of assets available to private sector investors.The indirect bidding, a proxy of foreign demand, was 76.1% for the 30-year TIPS sale. It was the highest level since June 2016, a sign of global investors\u2019 thirst for high-quality bonds in a low-yield world.Another sign of investors\u2019 hunger for income: Argentina earlier this week sold $2.75 billion of 100-year bonds in U.S. dollars, which attracted nearly $10 billion in orders.Investors are keeping an eye on crude oil futures, whose selloff this week has deflated inflation expectations and boosted the appeal of long-term government debt. Inflation chips away investors\u2019 purchasing power from their bond investments and is seen by investors as a big threat to the value of long-term Treasurys.U.S. crude oil prices strengthened Thursday after settling Wednesday at the lowest level since August 2016., but still down about 12% this month.Some analysts are concerned that the oil market may resume its slide again, a case that could drive long-term Treasury yields down further.Treasury bond yields have fallen even as the Fed raised short-term interest rates last week for the second time this year and signaled another hike before the end of this year.\u201cThe Fed keeps saying inflation is coming and the bond market continues to trade higher in price and lower in yield with almost the opposite viewpoint,\u201d said       Kevin Giddis,        head of fixed-income at Raymond James.The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond settled at 2.724% Thursday, unchanged from Wednesday, which was the lowest close since Nov. 8, 2016.

The move was broadly expected, particularly after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates last week.In its statement, the central bank made it clear it considers the current rate level as appropriate. \u201cThe reference rate has reached a level congruent with meeting the 3% inflation target,\u201d the bank said. One member of the board voted to keep rates unchanged.The central bank said the rate increase sought to anchor inflation expectations and was motivated in part by last week\u2019s Fed move. Mexico\u2019s annual inflation hit a fresh eight-year high in early June at 6.30%.A recovering peso, which has gained around 20% against the U.S. dollar since February, gave the central bank some room to signal the end of the rate-raising cycle. After the policy decision was announced, the peso slightly appreciated against the U.S. dollar.\u201cIt appears that policy makers are increasingly of the opinion that their work is done,\u201d said Adam Collins, a Latin America economist with Capital Economists, a research consultancy.Still, the central bank said it would remain prudent, as upside risks to inflation remain. It also said it would be watching the monetary stance relative to the U.S. Some economists expect the bank to raise rates again if the Fed does, to keep the peso attractive for investors.The Bank of Mexico has raised interest rates by 400 basis points since December 2015. Inflation started to climb last July as a weak peso started to affect inflation expectations. Then, in January, Mexico\u2019s government ordered an unprecedented 20% jump in gasoline prices, which in turn impacted transportation costs.The bank expects annual inflation to be \u201cconsiderably\u201d above the 4% during 2017, start slowing down by the end of the year and meet the 3% target by the fourth quarter of 2018.Many think the steep increase in borrowing costs, which weighs on consumption, could dent Mexico\u2019s economic growth prospects for the year. In its policy decision, the central bank said the economy showed signs of slowing down at the beginning of the second quarter, due to sluggish private consumption and investment.In the first quarter, Mexico\u2019s economy showed resilience, expanding at an annualized rate of 2.7%, as exports benefited from a weak peso early this year that made local products more competitive abroad.

Considering this situation, an increasingly vocal group of Democratic lawmakers now seem willing to risk fewer donations from Ms. Pelosi\u2019s coastal check-writers in the hope of collecting more votes further inland.And even some Democrats from coastal districts see the controversial Ms. Pelosi as no longer able to build a House majority. The Times reports:Ms. Pelosi\u2019s extremism won\u2019t sell in many parts of the country. But if Democrats are thinking they\u2019ve erred in not addressing voters\u2019 top priorities, then the blame doesn\u2019t just belong to the House minority leader. A broad swath of the Democratic caucus has been only too happy to spend months casting aspersions on the patriotism of President Trump without ever offering any \u201ccollusion\u201d evidence.Why have Democrats spent so little time addressing the concerns of average voters? The popular dinosaur who made this column famous once formulated the Taranto Principle, which held that favorable coverage by liberal journalists could actually harm Democrats by encouraging them to advocate media-friendly but politically-suicidal policies. Perhaps a related phenomenon has been at work in the Trump era, as many journalists reward pols who offer fact-free analysis about Russia rather than ideas to boost economic growth and create jobs. In this case it\u2019s not that voters oppose the Russia investigation; they just don\u2019t think it will solve their problems.The Legal Insurrection website offers the interesting story of Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) , who said on MSNBC:This is remarkable. Mr. Murphy, who was once a prominent promoter of the collusion hypothesis, is now turning Beltway conventional wisdom on its head. The operating assumption among journalists and politicos has been that the Russia investigation is a problem and a distraction for Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans as they try to enact a reform agenda. Now here\u2019s a Senate Democrat saying that the Russia story has actually wasted time that his party could have spent opposing Republican policies or trying to explain why Democrats should be given another chance to govern.This column is almost tempted to wonder if there was a secret plot designed to fool Democrats into talking about issues that voters don\u2019t care about.***Bottom Stories of the DayQuestion and AnswerMaybe They\u2019ve Seen What It\u2019s Doing to Hotels  \u201cCongressional Democrats Want a $15 Minimum Wage\u2014but Pay Their Interns Nothing,\u201d Heat Street, June 21Shortest Books Ever Written  \u201cWhat Donald Trump and       Sean Spicer       can learn from Al Franken,\u201d Vox, June 20Only If They Pass a Tax Cut First  \u201cVacation\u2019s All They Ever Wanted,\u201d The Atlantic, June 17***Follow James Freeman on Twitter.Subscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.(Carol Muller helps compile Best of the Web.

But in a room just 15 feet long, pivoting the bed so it faces the windows will leave enough room to comfortably navigate around it.\u201cIn cramped city apartments, you can\u2019t be a stickler,\u201d said New York designer       Grace Rosenstein.       \u201cA 2-foot clearance is good enough.\u201d Floating the bed also frequently blocks an uninspiring view of closet doors.This trick can also help people get more livability out of oddly proportioned spaces, such as lofts, said New York architect       Andrew Franz      : \u201cDividing a room with a large object can scale it down, creating more intimate areas.\u201dFor a 19th-century cottage on Wistowe Island, in Ontario\u2019s Muskoka lakes region, Toronto designer       Anne Hepfer       moved a master bed away from the room\u2019s doorway, fashioning a vestibule of sorts that provides more privacy when the door is open. When you\u2019re exposing the back of a headboard, as she did by moving the bed from the wall, it helps if the headboard is more structural and pleasant to look at, noted Ms. Hepfer, \u201cpreferably made of wood, in a more modern style.\u201d Alternatively, you can position a dresser or bookcase against the backs of less attractive headboards.You can always ditch the headboard completely, but where space and resources permit, consider commissioning a headboard especially designed for floating beds. For a contemporary house in Larkspur, Calif., San Francisco firm       Nicole Hollis       designed a bed destined to sit in front of white oak floor-to-ceiling closet cabinets. \u201cThe master bed is a single piece of custom furniture,\u201d said       Frank Merritt,        of Jensen Architects, who designed the house. \u201cIt incorporates the bed frame, side tables, reading lights and, on the back side, a dresser, all in the same knotty oak as the cabinets.\u201d The bed placement, closer to the windows, also gave its inhabitants better views of Mount Tamalpais and the bay beyond.\u2018This trick frequently blocks an uninspiring view of closet doors.\u2019Maximizing a view also motivated       Holly Hollenbeck,        of HSH Interiors in San Francisco, when she decorated a home in the hills of Marin County. Because three sides of the master bedroom were glass, when the bed occupies the middle of the room, \u201cthe wall behind you disappears from your visual plane, so it feels like you\u2019re sleeping in a tree house,\u201d explained Ms. Hollenbeck.Bay Area architect       Eric Haesloop       similarly accommodated clients who wanted to apply a Thoreau-esque aesthetic to their Silicon Valley home. The room in which he floated the master bed looks onto a small private pond surrounded by a hillside garden, but he pointed out that \u201cthis works in any home with a dominant view on one side.\u201dBoth Mr. Haesloop and Ms. Ruddy referred to studies suggesting that an uncluttered sleeping space\u2014free of visual distractions that remind one of work or chores\u2014allows for better sleep.No matter how you set up a bedroom, \u201cthe bed is the centerpiece,\u201d said Ms. Hollenbock. The irreverent act of liberating it from the walls not only gives it pride of place, but opens up a whole range of design possibilities.", "news_time": "2017-06-22 15:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/finding-extra-storage-in-your-bedroom-the-pro-trick-1498159641", "news_title": "A Pro Trick to Find Extra Bedroom Storage", "keywords": "bedroom design,get more out of your bedroom,insomnia,interior design for insomnia,maximizing apartment space,spacesaving design,storage solutions,Achille Salvagni,Andrew Franz,Anne Hepfer,Eric Haesloop,Frank Merritt,Grace Rosenstein,Holly Hollenbeck,Nancy Ruddy,Nicole Hollis,architecture,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,home improvements,living,lifestyle,real estate,property,technical services,architects,surveyors,business,consumer services,construction"}, {"content": "Heading into 2017, it seemed possible that the Chicago Cubs would be even better than the team that won the World Series a year ago.

Why didn\u2019t they stop them?\u201d he added.Mr. Johnson testified the Obama administration initially sought to avoid making announcements about Russian meddling efforts in order to not give the appearance it was taking sides in the election.When the administration did publicly address the efforts, in October, Mr. Johnson said the news was pushed \u201cbelow the fold\u201d by another story that day: the release of \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tapes that revealed Mr. Trump making lewd comments in 2005.On Thursday, Mr. Trump also criticized the Democratic National Committee, asking why the organization declined to turn over its server to the FBI and turned down the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s offer to help safeguard against cyberattacks.\u201cIt\u2019s all a big Dem HOAX,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!\u201dIt is common for victims of a breach to turn over logs and other data, but not the physical server.On Wednesday, Mr. Johnson testified that the DNC, which had a trove of emails stolen and published on WikiLeaks, and several states, rejected DHS\u2019s offer of assistance last summer.Mr. Johnson said he was told by his staff that the DNC didn\u2019t think it needed DHS\u2019s assistance at the time.A spokeswoman for the DNC wrote in a statement Wednesday: \u201cThe DNC was contacted by DHS months after the DNC worked closely with the FBI to remedy the intrusion. The DNC then provided DHS with detailed information about the intrusion. The DNC has been in regular contact with the FBI for many months and the FBI confirmed the DNC has provided all the information it needed to make its assessment.\u201dIn Thursday\u2019s White House briefing, spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president\u2019s tweet about a \u201choax\u201d referred to Democrats\u2019 efforts to \u201cdelegitimize his win in the election process, and less about the hack itself.\u201d She said Mr. Trump \u201cbelieves that Russia was part\u201d of interference efforts during the 2016 election.The tweets came after Mr. Trump spoke for more than an hour at a campaign-style rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, touching on a range of subjects but staying away from the Russia matter. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers and top advisers have urged him not to tweet or speak about Russian hacking efforts while the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel investigates Trump associates\u2019 ties to Russia\u2014a probe that recently widened to examine whether the president tried to obstruct justice by firing his former FBI director.Corrections & Amplifications   The \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in which President Donald Trump made lewd comments was filmed in 2005.

Helen Mirren       is a goddess. The mere suggestion of a prequel, sequel or similar intrusion on the sacred memory of Detective Chief Inspector       Jane Tennison       should be regarded the same way one regards emails from a needy Nigerian prince.Prime Suspect: TennisonBegins Sunday, 10 p.m., PBSThat said, \u201cPrime Suspect: Tennison\u201d is as ample a fix as any hopeless addict could hope for. Adapted by \u201cPrime Suspect\u201d creator       Lynda La Plante       from her novel \u201cTennison,\u201d it flashes back to 1973 and the 22-year-old Jane\u2019s debut with London\u2019s Metropolitan Police, delivering what one is almost afraid to expect: first-rate acting, a solid sense of period and a multi-pronged storyline rife with those uncanny-yet-somehow-plausible coincidences native to the well-plotted 19th-century novel.That the title role is played by       Stefanie Martini,        who has the face of a L\u2019Or\u00e9al model, might rankle longtime fans of the series. Ms. Mirren, while a beautiful woman, never made concessions to glamour. Ms. Martini can\u2019t help it. Her casting will no doubt strike some as shameless babe bait.Try to overlook her looks. Ms. Martini is not just a dramatic talent, bestowing life on what is sometimes parched dialogue, but she brings something else more unsettling to the role of Jane Tennison. In any prequel or sequel, the viewer naturally tries to conjure up the connections between the then and the now, the manner in which this face became that. What a viewer can\u2019t help but be haunted by in \u201cTennison\u201d is the notion that Ms. Martini\u2019s wide-eyed rabbit will morph into Ms. Mirren\u2019s wary fox precisely because of those same plagues that have always underlined the series. A hopelessly sexist institution. A constant thwarting of personal and professional aspirations. Alcohol. Errant sex. And, of course, two decades of soul-crushing crime.The principal offense in \u201cTennison\u201d has been committed against a 17-year-old part-time hooker and part-time junkie who turns up dead, pregnant, and only a few degrees of separation away from a family involved in\u2026well, we\u2019re not sure what they\u2019re involved in, not right away. But it\u2019s certainly a crime. And it\u2019s being plotted inside a prison by its incarcerated, pudding-faced paterfamilias,       Clifford Bentley       (      Alun Armstrong      ), and orchestrated on the outside by Clifford\u2019s worthless sons, the brutal John (Lex Shrapnel) and the feckless David (      Jay Taylor      ). Mom is played by       Ruth Sheen,        who\u2019s worth watching in anything.\u201cPrime Suspect: Tennison\u201d isn\u2019t all about investigation; the series never was. As much as anything, it\u2019s a character study. Jane, more \u201cposh\u201d than her new associates, is also smarter than anyone else. It\u2019s she who connects dots and has the right instincts\u2014and the stomach: \u201cLet\u2019s proceed to the fainting part,\u201d says a medical examiner as he begins an autopsy on the dead girl. Jane blanches but doesn\u2019t blink. As constructed by Ms. La Plante, the story consistently points out that the biases against Tennison and her female colleagues, notably the good-natured Kath (      Jessica Gunning      ), aren\u2019t just unjust, they\u2019re unwise: Kath and Jane get much more out of the dead girl\u2019s streetwalking associates than their lumpish male colleagues ever would; they recognize a bow detached from the dead girl\u2019s underwear. En route to a bereavement call on the family of the murder victim, Jane asks her superior officer and soon-to-be love interest,       Len Bradfield       (      Sam Reid      ), \u201cIf the mother cries, do I comfort her?\u201d Bradfield doesn\u2019t have a clue. It never occurred to him.No male officer has any hesitation about asking Jane or Kath to fetch the tea and biscuits. As the cases evolve, though, so do they\u2014a bit.

But European officials and analysts said the deal,\u00a0along with other defense initiatives, could open a new era of closer cooperation and more effective military spending in Europe.European leaders made \u201creal advances in the area of defense,\u201d said French President       Emmanuel Macron.       \u201cWe\u2019ve adopted a more comprehensive strategy.\u201dThe initiative, known as \u201cPermanent Structured Cooperation,\u201d or PESCO, was first tabled when the EU updated its basic treaty law in 2009. The plan was essentially shelved due to British concerns that EU defense ambitions could weaken or duplicate work done by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.With Britain leaving the bloc and U.S. President       Donald Trump       demanding increased military spending from NATO partners, Brussels has accelerated its ambitions for greater defense cooperation.\u201cThis is an enhanced cooperation initiative, open to everyone but not everyone needs to participate,\u201d German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       said at a news conference\u00a0Thursday\u00a0evening. \u201cFrom the French and German perspective, it\u2019s very important and a real step forward in the quality of cooperation among EU member states.\u201dEU leaders\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0also broadly backed a plan\u00a0for a new half-billion-euro EU defense fund\u00a0that would provide financial incentives for defense companies to cooperate across borders on common projects. The bloc has also launched a pilot project to help defense-research firms.PESCO has long been seen as a vital tool in greater defense cooperation. It will provide an EU structure for common projects or missions that don\u2019t require backing of all 28 member states at each step, as many joint projects now do.At\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0meeting, EU leaders fixed a three-month deadline for agreeing on critical elements of the plan, such as criteria for participating.\u00a0An initial list of projects will allow EU members to decide whether to join.EU foreign policy chief       Federica Mogherini       has said she hopes to launch PESCO by year-end, a goal EU leaders backed\u00a0Thursday, according to people briefed on discussions.Still, important differences remain. Some countries, particularly Germany, have pushed for easier entry criteria, allowing more countries to participate. France, in contrast, wanted to ensure that participating countries made ambitious pledges of money and material from the outset. That could allow PESCO to provide a platform for groups of EU countries to undertake demanding overseas operations.German officials have said they favor early projects that don\u2019t involve combat operations. They have suggested the first projects should focus on plans like a common European medical evacuation facility or drone technology. Ms. Merkel acknowledged \u201cconceptual differences\u201d between France and Germany.Mr. Macron said France and Germany plan to deepen discussions on PESCO when their governments hold a joint cabinet meeting on\u00a0July 13.Pauline Massart, the deputy director for security and geopolitics at Friends of Europe, a Brussels-based think tank, said there is strong momentum behind the common defense project, but \u201cit could falter on technicalities or political will.\u201d\u201cFrance has been okay with being a big military power and is well-supported by French citizens,\u201d said Ms.\u00a0Massart. \u201cThat obviously in Germany is less acceptable.\u201d\u2018This is an enhanced cooperation initiative, open to everyone but not everyone needs to participate.\u2019But EU diplomats say differences between Berlin and Paris may be narrowing. They say while France is signaling more patience on how quickly to scale up PESCO projects, Germany is signaling it will make a serious commitment to joint initiatives.\u201cI think we are witnessing a rapprochement between France and Germany,\u201d said a senior EU diplomat\u00a0on Wednesday. But, \u201cwe are not there yet,\u201d he said.Julia Himmrich,        a research fellow and the European Leadership Network, a London-based think tank, said the success of the initiative would depend in part on whether the EU\u2019s other defense projects come to fruition.\u201cWe are in a much more pro-European era than we were a year ago. The mood has really changed,\u201d Ms. Himmrich said.\u00a0\u201cIt is about sending a political message that there is a unified Europe, that member states are able to come together this time when it has failed so many times before.\u201d\u2014Valentina Pop and Stacy Meichtry contributed to this article.Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com and Julian E.

So I told my sister we\u2019d Airbnb. Once a sharing-economy platform becomes a widely recognized verb, it has left the realm of trend and become a cultural game-changer. After doubling its number of listings year after year, now offering 4 million private homes available for rent\u2014from the coast of South Carolina to the South China Sea\u2014Airbnb is currently valued at $31 billion.And yet, as I set about searching its stylish website\u2014using the winnowing filters to specify \u201centire house,\u201d \u201ctwo bathrooms\u201d and my budget\u2014and whizzing by all the crummy places and anything with Adirondack chairs in primary colors, the sun went quickly past the yardarm. These were wasted hours, ones I could have used to compose a fan tweet to Aziz Ansari, to practice my Spanish on Duolingo or to finish reading John McPhee\u2019s \u201cLevels of the Game.\u201d Besides, I ultimately came up empty: The sweet little house downtown with porches and parking was\u2026not available for our dates.Given such hassles, it is no wonder sophisticated travelers still resist the idea of vacation rentals. And many of the holdouts I interviewed also just can\u2019t fathom shacking up in someone else\u2019s house based on a few blurry snapshots. These Never Renters, as I fondly call them, aren\u2019t just hotel snobs, they\u2019ve been put off by horror stories\u2014iffy lock on the front door! stained sheets! dodgy Wi-Fi! questionable neighborhoods!\u2014like those told by renters and hosts on the website Airbnbhell, a veritable database of scams, shady policies and gory details. They don\u2019t want to live like a local, buy rainbow chard at the farmers\u2019 market or lollygag in a stranger\u2019s idea of good interior design. As we all know, photos can be deceptive. Alighting on a rental feels inherently riskier than booking a hotel.\u201cI have a lovely apartment,\u201d said Tania Chamlian, a former advertising creative director who lives in New York. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to go somewhere, it has to be at least as nice. I\u2019m a hotel person and all my friends are too. Sometimes I travel by myself, and I want to be pampered.\u201dThe difference now is that the home-sharing revolution is rewriting the rules of vacation accommodations. While Airbnb still dominates the field, posher rivals have sprung up catering to specific tastes, making it easier to find your home away from home and leading Airbnb to raise its game. The new players narrow the field according to type of traveler\u2014families with young children, say, or design enthusiasts\u2014while Airbnb still rewards those who enjoy the hunt. When Christopher Noey, a senior adviser in the director\u2019s office at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, rented a house on Lake Atitl\u00e1n in Guatemala, his friends were skeptical. \u201cThey thought it was a crazy roll of the dice,\u201d he said. But Mr. Noey is a fierce researcher who managed to score a stylish five-bedroom villa with a hot tub, daily maid service, a cook and someone who came in the afternoon to light the fire on the terrace. He found the listing on Airbnb, for about $90 a night per person. \u201cOne afternoon, we see a fisherman out on the lake,\u201d he said. \u201cHe rows over to our dock and delivers the fish to the cook. That\u2019s not going to happen in a hotel.\u201dHe is not the only convert. Manhattanite Ricky Ian Gordon, an opera composer, harbors great affection for grand hotels, so last year, when his husband rented an apartment in Paris for a week, he felt a bit crestfallen and rather trepidatious. \u201cWe get up to this place on the Seine, go inside, and I can\u2019t even believe this could be an Airbnb,\u201d said Mr. Gordon. \u201cThe guy who lets it is an art collector. The living-room ceiling is painted like the Sistine Chapel. There are art books everywhere, and beautiful antiques. He has surrealist paintings on the wall. It was magical and much more fun than a hotel. For 10 days, we had a home in Paris.\u201dThis possibility of playing house in many of the planet\u2019s most appealing destinations has spurred a tidal wave of interest in home and apartment rentals world-wide. In 2015, nearly one in three U.S. travelers stayed in some form of private accommodation\u2014through rental sites including HomeAway and Flipkey, both precursors to Airbnb\u2014up from about one in 10 in 2011, according to Phocuswright, a tourism research firm. Meanwhile, fancier rental companies, like Luxury Retreats, are trying to woo the jet set with more consistently hotel-like quality. Another, Onefinestay, which claims to rigorously vet all properties, somehow convinces homeowners who would never consider renting their house to strangers to do so.When Kinvara Balfour, a tech consultant and film director from London, travels for work, she often uses Onefinestay. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliantly managed,\u201d said Ms. Balfour, who recently stayed in a sunny, open-plan house in Los Angeles that comes with cleaning service. \u201cWhen I fly from London, I usually arrive at 10 o\u2019clock at night,\u201d she said, adding that a Onefinestay representative \u201cgreets you and shows you around, gives you a welcome pack with instructions to the house, the Wi-Fi password, coffee and tea.

It\u2019s hilariously hyperverbal, yet wonderfully heartfelt. Will the lovers and those around them ever stop talking? You wish they wouldn\u2019t, because the flow of language is such giddy fun. You hope they will; quiet time is required for deeper connections. No need for concern on either count, though. Here\u2019s a movie in which wishes and hopes are eventually granted.The lovers, Kumail and Emily, are played, respectively and brilliantly, by Kumail Nanjiani and       Zoe Kazan.       He\u2019s an aspiring stand-up comic and sometime Uber driver. She\u2019s a graduate student and future therapist. They meet between sets at a comedy club. You may know Mr. Nanjiani\u2014who, like his character, was born in Pakistan\u2014from his role as Dinesh on the HBO comedy series \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d He and his wife,       Emily V. Gordon,        wrote \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d as a liberties-taken version of their romance, which was interrupted when she fell victim to a mysterious illness that threatened to kill her. The film was directed by       Michael Showalter      \u2014if there\u2019s a false note in his work I missed it\u2014and produced by       Judd Apatow       and       Barry Mendel.       (Producers seldom get mentioned in movie reviews, but Mr. Apatow, the guiding spirit of such memorable comedies as \u201cThe 40-Year-Old Virgin,\u201d \u201cKnocked Up\u201d and \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d has left his mark on every elegantly crafted scene of this one.)These days, when so many feature films are dumbed down to marketable proportions\u2014or created for overseas consumption, and domestic audiences be damned\u2014there\u2019s reason to be grateful for any straightforward story that\u2019s executed competently. \u201cThe Big Sick,\u201d by contrast, interweaves at least four strands of a complex sequence of events that changes tone, switches moods and pauses for grace notes or casual lunacies, but never loses track of its characters\u2019 emotional cores, or their screwball-urgent zest for life.Kumail and Emily play out a love story, and subsequent break-up, with witty words that can defeat passion; he\u2019s the comic, but she\u2019s his equal in nervous banter and reflexive self-irony. (He looks a bit too old for her, but that loses significance as the relationship progresses.) Kumail is trapped in a classic tale of incomplete assimilation; his love for Emily conflicts with his traditional parents\u2019 insistence on an arranged marriage. Emily\u2019s illness transforms everything; what was funny is now suddenly and inexplicably a matter of life or death (though funny makes its first, sly comeback when Kumail uses his unconscious beloved\u2019s thumb to unlock her phone so he can contact her parents.)Everything is transformed again by the arrival of Emily\u2019s father, Terry (      Ray Romano      ), and her mother, Beth (Holly Hunter), a pair of cuckoo-birds with territorial instincts; they see Kumail only as an ex-boyfriend who has forfeited his right to have any say in her care. (All his frustrations explode when he can\u2019t get four slices of cheese on the same burger in the best food-ordering scene since \u201cFive Easy Pieces.\u201d)Earlier in the film we\u2019ve had a strong sense of who Emily is: tender, vulnerable, quick to embrace Kumail as the soulmate he is but slow to see the red flag of reticence he\u2019s been waving. Now, with Emily\u2019s parents taking charge, we get a sense of what made her who she is.These two were not cut out for parenting, or marriage. Beth is a loose cannon on a runaway tank\u2014a compact tank, given Ms. Hunter\u2019s stature, but an unstoppable one, given the gorgeous ferocity of her portrayal. (After all her distinctive performances over the decades, this one is astonishing.) Terry is interestingly bookish, even thoughtful, but his mind is linked to his mouth by the neural equivalent of a slipping transmission. \u201cLove isn\u2019t easy,\u201d he tells Kumail at one point. \u201cThat\u2019s why they call it love.\u201d Kumail, baffled, says, \u201cI don\u2019t get that.\u201d Terry, rueful, replies, \u201cI know. I thought I could just start talking and something smart would come out.\u201dEveryone talks compulsively\u2014clouds of words and sentences that come out funny, more than anything else, but also smart and, best of all, charged with honest feeling. That\u2019s the signal achievement of the screenplay, and of Mr. Nanjiani\u2019s sweetly soulful presence at the center of the action. As a stand-up comic, Kumail is desperate\u2014to please, to break free, to succeed. As a man, his struggle is to strengthen his spine, stand up to his life and take his place with Emily, however long her life may last. It\u2019s a lot for any movie to take on. \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d pulls it off with unquenchable humor and ineffable grace.Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'A Cure for the Common Comedy.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 14:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-big-sick-review-a-cure-for-the-common-comedy-1498156426", "news_title": "\u2018The Big Sick\u2019 Review: A Cure for the Common Comedy", "keywords": "arts in review, barry mendel,comedy, judd apatow, kumail nanjiani, michael showalter, the big sick, zoe kazan,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,reviews"}, {"content": "A few minutes into \u201cThe Beguiled\u201d I found myself thinking about Tesla, of all things. Not the car, since this is a period piece, set in rural Virginia during the Civil War, but the Tesla coil, a 19th-century invention that builds up an electrical charge, then lets it loose in a spectacular display. The charge in       Sofia Coppola\u2019s       remarkable film is sexual, and intense. (At last month\u2019s Cannes Film Festival Ms. Coppola won the Palme d\u2019Or for best director, the second woman to do so in the festival\u2019s 70-year-history.) When that charge is released, the result is both spectacular and thoroughly, if eerily, satisfying.The physical setting is eerie too\u2014a Greek Revival mansion, with a wrought-iron gate, that houses a finishing school for girls. There, within earshot of the war\u2019s contending cannons, lissome young women in white linen dresses conjugate French verbs and dine decorously by candlelight in the course of learning to be ladies. But their fragile state of grace is shattered by a new arrival\u2014a badly injured Union soldier,       John McBurney       (      Colin Farrell      ), found in the nearby woods by one of the school\u2019s youngest students and brought into the house for treatment of his wound.\u201cYou are a most unwelcome visitor,\u201d the soldier is promptly told by the school\u2019s headmistress,       Martha Farnsworth      ; she\u2019s played exquisitely by       Nicole Kidman.       Nothing could be further from the truth. For Martha\u2019s wide-eyed charges, who include       Elle Fanning\u2019s       Alicia, and for their spinster teacher, Edwina (      Kirsten Dunst      ), McBurney is an object of desire, though unstated at first, and unwavering fascination. Courtly for a northerner\u2014actually an immigrant Dubliner who joined the Union army\u2014McBurney is vividly aware of his impact, especially on the student body\u2019s bodies. \u201cGrateful to be your prisoner,\u201d he says dryly, an enemy of the Confederacy caught up in a fateful skirmish of the sexual wars.Of all the elements that go into the making of a fine film like this one, the most elusive may be tone. What gave Ms. Coppola\u2019s \u201cLost in Translation\u201d such distinction was its delicate tone of longing. The prevailing tone here is no less delicate, until the story explodes into gothic horror. It\u2019s all about repression and curiosity giving way to jealousy and carnal energy. Martha has her own imperatives\u2014all we know for a while is that her frostiness will not prove to be permafrost\u2014and Ms. Kidman brings her own dramatic logic to her role. She seems to have reached a point of such confident control in her career that she can speak volumes without raising her voice, as in \u201cLion,\u201d or cut through emotional chaos, as she does here, with little more than a clear-eyed glance. (I couldn\u2019t resist seeing Martha as a relentlessly sane version of       Blanche DuBois.      )This is the second theatrical feature to be adapted from the novel of the same name by       Thomas Cullinan.       The first, released in 1971, was directed by       Don Siegel       and starred       Geraldine Page       as Martha and a hunky       Clint Eastwood       as McBurney. It\u2019s an interesting production, occasionally a weird one\u2014the soldier plants ardent kisses on the lips of the 12-year-old girl who finds him in the woods\u2014and clearly a film made by men from a strong male\u2019s point of view.Ms. Coppola\u2019s production, beautifully photographed by       Philippe Le Sourd,        gives the man all the power due him, while Mr. Farrell\u2019s terrific performance takes McBurney all the way from suspect courtesy to primal rage. Yet the strength of her film transcends the soldier\u2019s power to seduce. We\u2019re beguiled, as an audience, by seeing this male animal as he is seen, and for better and worse experienced, by a diverse and dynamic group of females. And by seeing, in the end, how \u201cThe Beguiled\u201d gives new and memorable meaning to the notion of a finishing school.Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.comCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Ms. Coppola was the first woman to win the Palme d\u2019Or for best director at the Cannes Film Festival.", "news_time": "2017-06-22 14:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-beguiled-review-sexual-tension-south-of-the-mason-dixon-1498156414", "news_title": "\u2018The Beguiled\u2019 Review: Sexual Tension South of the Mason-Dixon Line", "keywords": "arts in review,civil war, elle fanning, kristen dunst,movie, nicol kidman, sofia coppola,the beguiled,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,reviews"}, {"content": "President       Donald Trump       on Thursday told technology and telecom executives the government will tackle federal regulations they consider too restrictive but stopped short of announcing any specific policies aimed at their industries.The White House meeting drew executives from two dozen companies, including             AT&T Inc.,        T 0.39%Honeywell International Inc.

But, he added, it was \u201chelpful to have the guy at the top taking an interest in your industry.\u201dThe event piggybacked off another White House tech summit on Monday. Leaders from             Amazon.com Inc.,Microsoft Corp.      ,             Oracle Corp.       and others volunteered their help modernizing government IT systems, though White House official\u2019s comments on their initiatives shed little light on what policies, if any, the administration plans to change.The president also promised Wednesday that his infrastructure spending proposal for Congress would carry support for rural broadband, a potential boon for CenturyLink\u2019s largely rural customer base.

The judge declined to comment on whether his order on Wednesday might apply to the sales announced Tuesday.JBS said in a regulatory filing that it will appeal Wednesday\u2019s ruling.

Authorities are now testing the cladding on those buildings to determine how many used the same material as Grenfell Tower, the site of the disaster.British Prime Minister       Theresa May,        in an appearance before Parliament on Thursday, said a number of buildings had already been found to contain \u201ccombustible\u201d cladding.A spokesman for the prime minister\u2019s office said that so far cladding samples from seven high-rise public-housing buildings in four local government areas have failed the inflammability tests. The tests are continuing and this number could rise, he said.During a refurbishment of Grenfell Tower completed last year, contractors installed a widely used material on the exterior of the building. It consists of an aluminum shell and a flammable plastic filling.The cladding material, called Reynobond PE and made by             Arconic Inc.,       is marketed around the world. In the U.S., its use is generally limited to lower buildings because of fire-safety concerns.U.K. officials have said the material didn\u2019t meet building standards for towers above 18 meters, or about 59 feet, tall. But British building industry experts and the British company that supplied the material to Grenfell Tower contractors maintain that it is compliant with current building codes.Arconic makes a similar product, Reynobond FR, using a fire-retardant filling. It wasn\u2019t used in the Grenfell Tower refurbishment.The cladding has become a focus for authorities in the aftermath of the fire because video footage of the blaze appeared to show flames spreading fast up the building along its exterior. Recent fires in France, Australia and the United Arab Emirates have involved quickly spreading flames along buildings\u2019 exterior cladding, as well, raising global concerns about such material.It isn\u2019t clear if any of those fires involved the exact same cladding as that covering the 24-storey Grenfell Tower.British authorities are conducting a criminal investigation into the fire.British fire-service officials and others were now involved in a large-scale testing operation, soliciting samples of building materials from across Britain to test. Mrs. May suggested the U.K. would relocate residents in towers that were identified as containing flammable cladding. Such a move could involve relocating tens of thousands of residents.\u201cWe cannot and won\u2019t ask people to live in unsafe homes,\u201d she told Parliament.London Mayor       Sadiq Khan       called for the government specifically to rehouse residents affected. \u201cThere is now a huge amount of work to urgently do to ensure that it is safe for people to remain in properties affected. If not, the government must support people being rehoused immediately while cladding is being removed.\u201dThe U.K. Department for Communities and Local Government has said such cladding isn\u2019t compliant with building regulations, citing rules that say any insulation used in external wall construction for high-rise buildings should be of \u201climited combustibility.\u201d A spokesman repeated that position Thursday morning.But others inside the industry have contested the government\u2019s interpretation of that rule. This week, CEP Architectural Facades Ltd., the company that supplied the cladding material, said Reynobond PE does comply with building regulations in England and Wales. CEP provided the cladding to a separate contractor, Harley Facades Ltd., which installed it as part of the refurbishment.Harley Facades last week said it would be inappropriate to comment on any aspect of the fire or its causes in advance of the investigation and that it wasn\u2019t aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower. A spokesman on Thursday declined to comment on whether Reynobond PE was compliant with building regulations.Arconic couldn't immediately be reached for comment.Arnold Tarling, a chartered surveyor and fire-safety expert, said building regulations did allow for cladding to contain flammable substance, as long as it was \u201cfully bonded\u201d to a noncombustible material like aluminum, as is the case with Reynobond PE. He said cladding wasn\u2019t generally viewed as insulation but that, even if it were, then bonding aluminum sheets to both faces would make it compliant.Mrs. May, during her appearance in the House of Commons, declined to answer questions about whether the Grenfell Tower cladding was compliant with building rules, saying she didn\u2019t want to prejudice the investigation.Write to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com and Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. Warns of Risks To More High-Rises.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 14:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-government-warns-cladding-from-grenfell-tower-fire-on-more-buildings-1498137994", "news_title": "U.K. Warns Cladding From Grenfell Tower Fire on Hundreds of Buildings ", "keywords": " cladding,grenfell tower, london, residential fire,reynobond ,reynobond pe,U.K. government,political,general news,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,man-made disasters,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "President       Donald Trump       doesn\u2019t have recordings of his conversations with former FBI director       James Comey,        he said Thursday, ending more than a month of questions about the existence of any tapes as the two men dispute each other\u2019s accounts of their discussions.\u201cWith all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea whether there are \u2018tapes\u2019 or recordings of my conversations with James Comey,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cBut I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings.\u201dMr. Trump first raised the prospect of such recordings in a tweet days after firing Mr. Comey in May, when he wrote that the former FBI director \u201cbetter hope\u201d no tapes of their conversations exist. The tweet came a day after a             New York Times                   report that in a January meeting, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey to pledge his loyalty to him, and Mr. Comey declined.Since then, Mr. Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that the president had asked for his loyalty and that Mr. Trump had indicated he wanted the FBI to back off its investigation of former national security adviser       Mike Flynn.       Referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet about tapes, Mr. Comey said, \u201cLordy, I hope there are tapes.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s lawyer immediately disputed the testimony. \u201cThe President never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone, including suggesting that Mr. Comey \u2018let Flynn go,\u2019\u201d said       Marc Kasowitz,        Mr. Trump\u2019s private attorney. \u201cThe President also never told Mr. Comey, \u2018I need loyalty, I expect loyalty\u2019 in form or substance.\u201dThe next day, in a news conference, Mr. Trump himself disputed Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony and said he would testify to that effect under oath, \u201c100%.\u201dIn that same news conference, Mr. Trump hinted that he soon would have an announcement on the existence of any tapes. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you about that over a very short period of time,\u201d he said, adding that reporters would be \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the answer.Mr. Comey testified that Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet about \u201ctapes\u201d prompted him to authorize a friend to leak to the news media his notes about his meetings with the president, which he said he kept because he felt Mr. Trump might lie about their discussions.The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that the U.S. Secret Service has no audio copies or transcripts of any tapes recorded within Mr. Trump\u2019s White House. The Secret Service handled recording systems within the White House for past presidents, including       Richard Nixon       and       John F. Kennedy.Since Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey, the Justice Department appointed a special counsel to oversee the investigation of Trump associates\u2019 ties to Russia. The special counsel probe has widened recently to include examining whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by firing Mr. Comey. Mr. Trump has called the probe a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dIn Thursday\u2019s briefing, White House spokeswoman       Sarah Sanders       declined to answer a question about why Mr. Trump had raised the prospect of \u201ctapes\u201d over a period of nearly six weeks.\u201dThe president\u2019s statement via             Twitter                   today is extremely clear,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to add.\u201dAsked whether Mr. Trump regretted the tweet, given its role in prompting Mr. Comey to authorize the release of his memos, Ms. Sanders said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dMs. Sanders said she wasn\u2019t aware of any Oval Office recordings involving anyone.Asked whether Mr. Trump believes that there could be other recordings that he doesn\u2019t know about, Ms. Sanders said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dPressed on why he tweeted that he had \u201cno idea whether there are \u2018tapes\u2019 or recordings\u201d by others, Ms. Sanders responded, \u201cBecause he was asked about tapes and he\u2019s answering that question.\u201dMs. Sanders also was asked whether the president had first tweeted about the possible existence of tapes last month to ensure that Mr. Comey told the truth about their conversations.

The program allows former students who embark on public-service careers to have federal student loan balances forgiven after 10 years of payments.\u201cWe want every eligible consumer to be able to take advantage of the benefits of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program without having to worry about servicing breakdowns that can cause them to lose out on months of qualifying payments,\u201d CFPB Director       Richard Cordray       said at a public event in Raleigh, N.C.More than 500,000 people have signaled their intention to seek debt forgiveness under the program, with almost two-thirds of them earning less than $50,000, according to the Education Department.\u00a0The program is designed for government employees, including military, and people who work as nurses, doctors and social workers for nonprofit organizations.The CFPB also issued a review of complaints it has received over student loan-servicing issues, highlighting problems that borrowers said they faced with the public-service program. People have complained they received incorrect or insufficient information from servicers about eligibility and about processing delays and errors that caused borrowers to miss out on qualified payments, the CFPB said.The CFPB said its supervisors will look at loan servicers\u2019 communications with borrowers. The bureau wants to make sure servicers tell eligible consumers what they need to do to qualify for loan forgiveness and when they aren\u2019t on track to qualify. It also wants to make sure servicers have accurately evaluated a borrower\u2019s eligibility and progress toward loan forgiveness.The CFPB\u2019s analyzed complaints about the public-service program that it received between March 2016 and February 2017, listing several companies with a high number of complaints. Among them are American Education Services, an arm of the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, Xerox Education Services LLC\u2019s ACS Education Services, and             Navient Corp.None of the companies responded to requests for comment.Overall, the CFPB said it received 11,500 federal student loan-servicing complaints during the period.The Trump administration proposed eliminating the program in its fiscal 2018 budget. Should that occur, the White House plan would affect loans issued on or after July 1, 2018.

Then he finished tied for 23rd at Erin Hills.\u201cThe game is strange,\u201d Furyk said. \u201cSometimes you feel like you\u2019re so far away. It feels like a total breakdown, then you make one minor tweak, and all of a sudden, \u2018There it is. That feels good.\u2019\u201dMost modern golf stars stand out in a way that is more exceptional than relatable. With their chiseled physiques and 300-plus-yard drives, the likes of Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy look like they are playing a different game than everyone else. That has always been less so with Furyk.Part of it is his gangly frame. Part of it is his unconventional, upright swing, which was once described by television analyst David Feherty as looking \u201clike an octopus falling out of a tree.\u201dEven his otherworldly round last summer revealed something that is hardly unique to touring pros: just how fickle golf can be.After shooting a 72 the day before, Furyk went to the driving range in the evening feeling perplexed. He had his caddie, Fluff Cowan, send a swing video to his father and swing coach, Mike. But the response wasn\u2019t a magical swing fix. Mike Furyk told his son his swing looked great.If anything, Furyk\u2019s prevailing thought before his morning tee time that Sunday wasn\u2019t a swing thought at all. It was about the afternoon flight home he had already booked. After a month on the road, he knew he would spend that night in his own bed. He woke up in a better mood.\u201cThen you get some momentum and some confidence, and you start firing at flags,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden, you don\u2019t see trouble. You see the center of the fairway and the pin. It\u2019s amazing what your body can do when you\u2019re in that frame of mind.\u201dWhere the mental side ends and the mechanical side begins remains a mystery to Furyk even after all these years of playing. Did he reel off 10 birdies and an eagle that day because the thought of going home put him at ease? Or did his efforts to shorten his swing all week finally just pay off?The ambiguity makes it hard for him to draw much from that day that he can apply to future rounds. On Tuesday night, he watched a one-minute video clip the PGA Tour made of the highlights from his 58. But the value was more nostalgic than instructive. For him, golf remains an endless search.\u201cI forget what famous pro said this: You never really have it. You just borrow it for a while,\u201d Furyk said. \u201cJust when things are going well and you\u2019re hitting it great\u2014it\u2019s almost like you get this feeling of invincibility\u2014that\u2019s when it bites you in the ass.\u201dWrite to Brian Costa at brian.costa@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 13:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-jim-furyks-58-came-out-of-nowhere-1498153663", "news_title": "How Jim Furyk\u2019s 58 Came Out of Nowhere", "keywords": "furyk,golf,jim furyk,jim furyk 58,pga tour,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The nominee to serve as the top U.S. derivatives regulator breezed through his confirmation hearing Thursday, presenting himself as a nonideological deal maker who would focus on upgrading his agency\u2019s capabilities to regulate and monitor increasingly complex markets.J. Christopher Giancarlo,        the current acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a Republican commissioner since 2014, told the Senate Agriculture Committee he would focus on streamlining existing rules and improving the commission\u2019s data analysis, as well as embracing the use of financial technology in the market and at the CFTC.Mr. Giancarlo\u2019s confirmation still needs to be advanced by the agriculture committee and then go to the Senate floor for a vote.The panel\u2019s chairman, Sen. Pat Roberts (R., Kan.), praised Mr. Giancarlo\u2019s tenure at the CFTC and noted that as commissioner, he had been confirmed by the committee unanimously and in the Senate by a voice vote, a procedure typically used for noncontroversial business.Mr. Roberts expressed his hope that the White House would move to quickly nominate additional commissioners to the CFTC. The commission currently has just two members\u2014Mr. Giancarlo and Democratic Commissioner Sharon Bowen, who on Tuesday said she planned to step down in the coming months. The White House has already announced the nominations of two Republicans; Mr. Roberts said he would prefer to have one hearing for all four new commissioners: two Republicans and two Democrats, in accordance with Senate custom.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to shake the tree at the White House to get the other nominees forward. If we can do that right after the July break\u2026that would be very helpful,\u201d Mr. Roberts told reporters after the hearing, referring to Congress\u2019s planned recess the week of July 4.The dearth of commissioners makes it highly unlikely for the CFTC to approve major new rules. Mr. Giancarlo promised to finish outstanding rules, such as position limits to prevent speculation, but practically speaking, he can\u2019t do so without at least three seats filled on the commission.Mr. Roberts was the only Republican senator present at the hearing, while other members of his party met elsewhere on Capitol Hill to discuss efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The proceedings went remarkably quickly for a confirmation hearing, lasting just under 40 minutes.Democrats on the committee pressed Mr. Giancarlo on whether his initiative to simplify rules\u2014officially dubbed the \u201cKiss\u201d initiative, for \u201cKeep it Simple, Stupid\u201d\u2014was simply a regulatory rollback by another name.Mr. Giancarlo assured them that the effort was focused only on relieving some of the compliance burdens and confusion faced by market participants, and that no rules would be rewritten as part of the project and the goal wasn\u2019t to dilute the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law.\u201cProject Kiss is not about rolling back Dodd-Frank or Wall Street reforms in any shape of fashion,\u201d he said. He took pains to note his longstanding support for Dodd-Frank\u2019s Title VII, which gives the CFTC authority to regulate over-the-counter swaps markets.He did, however, reiterate his desire to rewrite the CFTC\u2019s swaps execution rules, which he has long argued have adverse effects on liquidity by limiting the venues counterparties can use to execute swap trades.Though Democrats pressed Mr. Giancarlo on whether he had coordinated with the Trump administration on a possible regulatory rollback (he said he hadn\u2019t), they praised him for breaking from the Trump administration by submitting the CFTC\u2019s own budget request to Congress, as is the prerogative of independent agencies.The Trump administration called for the CFTC\u2019s budget to be kept flat at $250 million, while the CFTC\u2019s budget called for an increase of $31.5 million. At a budget request hearing earlier this month, House Republicans signaled that they would give more credence to the Trump administration\u2019s budget request. Mr. Giancarlo repeated his position that the CFTC shouldn\u2019t be funded with user fees, as is the case with the Securities and Exchange Commission, because market participants must already pay transaction fees to self-regulatory organizations. Additional costs, he said, could have a negative impact on liquidity.Mr. Giancarlo said the additional resources he requested would be used to fund the CFTC\u2019s financial-technology initiative and improvements in data analysis, including the hiring of several new economists to research market conditions. More market analysis is essential, he said, to understand whether the effects of algorithmic trading in the market are \u201charmful or benign.\u201dWrite to Gabriel T.

They also are reviewing certain bank capital requirements, they said, to streamline oversight.\u201cI don\u2019t think what we\u2019re talking about here amounts to. broad deregulation,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cI think it amounts to making regulation more efficient, protecting the important gains we\u2019ve made [since the financial crisis]. We\u2019re not really talking about some massive program here.\u201dThe remarks from the regulators are the latest evidence that bank overseers are taking a softer tone on Wall Street following the election of President       Donald Trump.       They come as Senate lawmakers are developing bipartisan legislation to ease the 2010 Dodd-Frank law and other postcrisis rules. Most of the changes discussed by policy makers on Thursday could be accomplished without legislation.Key Republican lawmakers, including Senate Banking Committee Chairman       Mike Crapo       (R., Idaho), say their aim is to increase lending and boost the economy. Critics, including Ohio Sen.       Sherrod Brown,        the ranking Democrat on the committee, say policy makers may undo important consumer protections.\u201cThere is no evidence that relaxing rules will lead banks to lend more,\u201d Mr. Brown said at Thursday\u2019s hearing.Mr. Powell, the central bank\u2019s new regulatory point man, said it could be appropriate to ease annual stress tests for big banks, including a change that would prevent a bank from failing a test solely for \u201cqualitative\u201d reasons related to risk management.\u201cI believe it will be appropriate\u201d to remove that part of the test \u201cfor those firms that achieve and sustain high-quality capital-planning capabilities,\u201d Mr. Powell said in his testimony. He also said the Fed could adjust how it makes assumptions about banks\u2019 balance sheets and capital distributions.Any changes to the stress tests wouldn\u2019t apply to this year\u2019s results. The Fed is scheduled to release results of the annual exams on big banks in two parts, on Thursday afternoon and next week.Mr. Noreika criticized regulators\u2019 implementation of the Volcker rule.\u201cThe Volcker rule provides a practical example of how conflicting messages and inconsistent interpretation can exacerbate regulatory burden,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder my leadership, the OCC is undertaking improvements in our internal operations to attack that problem in ways that are within our control.\u201dMr. Noreika said he is working with staff to use \u201cone voice\u201d on how they will enforce the Volcker rule. He also said he has solicited suggestions from his agency\u2019s staff across the nation on how to reduce banks\u2019 regulatory burdens, and has received roughly 400 responses.Many of the statements by Messrs. Powell and Noreika line up with a report released last week by the Treasury Department, such as raising or otherwise altering the $50 billion asset threshold at which big banks face stricter rules under Dodd-Frank. The Treasury report also called for simplifying the Volcker rule, rather than repealing it as some congressional Republicans, particularly those in the House, have advocated.Both the regulators and the Treasury report support a review of bank capital rules, particularly with respect to community banks.Mr. Powell, who described the Treasury report as \u201ca mixed bag,\u201d said the Fed is reviewing the calibration of a key capital rule for big banks called the leverage ratio. He said firms with a custody bank business model, in particular, are \u201cdisproportionately affected by the leverage ratio.\u201dMartin Gruenberg,        chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., pushed back against some aspects of the Trump administration\u2019s plan, including a recommendation to eliminate his agency\u2019s role in reviewing big banks\u2019 \u201cliving wills.\u201d These documents outline how the banks could go through bankruptcy without needing a taxpayer bailout. The FDIC, which handles bank failures, currently shares responsibility for reviewing these plans with the Fed, which oversees bank holding companies.Mr. Gruenberg was picked by former President       Barack Obama,        and the White House recently nominated Republican congressional staffer       James Clinger       to succeed him at the end of November.In his remarks Thursday, Mr. Gruenberg also warned against changes to the leverage ratio. Though the Fed is preparing to ease that rule, Mr. Gruenberg said it \u201cshould not be weakened,\u201d citing risks to the financial system.Mr. Noreika, a former banking lawyer whom the Trump administration named acting comptroller in early May, made some of the most ambitious suggestions, including several that tread on other regulators\u2019 turf.He suggested removing consumer-finance supervision of banks from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and putting it back in the hands of his agency and others. That would represent a return to the way things were before the 2008 financial crisis. The Treasury report also made that recommendation.\u2014Ryan Tracy contributed to this article.Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com and Rachel Witkowski at rachel.witkowski@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 13:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulators-propose-a-lighter-touch-for-banking-oversight-1498153133", "news_title": "U.S. Regulators Propose a Lighter Touch for Banking Oversight ", "keywords": " banking regulations, comptroller of the currency, leverage ratio , stress tests,volcker rule,The Fed,Martin Gruenberg,Jerome Powell,Keith Noreika,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "The Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 is here, and investors aren\u2019t remotely concerned.Senate Republicans unveiled their bid to overhaul the Affordable Care Act on Thursday morning, amid protests outside GOP Senate offices.It is safe to say the protesters weren\u2019t representing owners of health-care stocks. The Health Care Select Sector Index ripped higher once again following the act\u2019s late morning release and has now returned more than 17% this year.That is odd. Should this bill become, law, drug, hospital and insurer stockholders would likely make some noise of their own. The Senate bill, much like the version which cleared the House last month, contemplates deep, albeit gradual, cuts to Medicaid funding, which would likely lower total health spending. The Senate bill phases out Medicaid funds more gradually than the House plan, but would ultimately result in deeper cuts over the long term.The bill also would lower the income threshold at which individuals qualify for insurance subsidies. That would seem to amplify the trend toward skimpier health plans with higher deductibles, which will keep their focus high on costs.Investors are betting\u2014reasonably\u2014that the bill won\u2019t pass the Senate and become law. After all, Republicans hold just a two-seat majority in the Senate, and recent polling suggests the bill\u2019s provisions are significantly less popular than the ACA. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that at least six Senate Republicans have expressed reservations about the bill\u2019s contents. Should those reservations turn into actual votes against the bill, the sector\u2019s rally could continue.However, with each new high for the sector comes increased danger. It is clear that stocks aren\u2019t at all pricing in a negative outcome.

TSLA -0.91%       said it is exploring with government officials in Shanghai the possibility of opening a facility to build electric vehicles for the Chinese market.The Silicon Valley auto maker reiterated Thursday it plans to define its production plans for China by year\u2019s end. China, the world\u2019s largest market for new-car sales and a big consumer of luxury vehicles, is an important market for Tesla, especially as the government pushes for more electric vehicles.\u201cTesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market, and we continue to evaluate potential manufacturing sites around the globe to serve the local markets,\u201d Tesla said in a written statement. \u201cWhile we expect most of our production to remain in the U.S., we do need to establish local factories to ensure affordability for the markets they serve.\u201dTesla didn\u2019t mention a local joint-venture partner. China requires foreign auto makers to operate factories with local partners, though officials have signaled a willingness to relax such requirements. In May, Tesla Chief Executive       Elon Musk,        who had recently visited China, cryptically suggested such rule changes would be \u201cgood timing.\u201dBy making cars in China, Tesla could cut the prices of its vehicles by one-third by reducing shipping costs and avoiding import duties, Mr. Musk has said.In afternoon trading in New York on Thursday, Tesla\u2019s shares were up 2.2% at $384.57. The stock is up roughly 80% this year.China charges a 25% duty on all imported cars, but the hefty markup hasn\u2019t deterred affluent buyers who regard a Tesla vehicle as a prestige item.One Chinese Tesla owner, Chen Zhanchong, said he paid $176,000 for a Tesla Model S P90D in late 2015, well over the sales price in the U.S. But the 31-year-old Guangzhou resident, who recently left his job at an internet company, said it was still a good value for a high-performance electric car.\u201cIf a cheap Model 3 is produced in China in large quantities, local companies won\u2019t be able to compete,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cTesla will enjoy explosive growth.\u201dTesla reported over $1 billion in revenue in China in 2016, a figure that analysts say equates to about 11,000 vehicle sales. The company sold just over 76,000 cars globally last year.And sales in China have accelerated in 2017: Tesla sold about 5,500 cars in China in the first four months of the year, according to EV Sales, a website that tracks the electric-vehicle market.Yet while local manufacturing gives Tesla the opportunity to sell cars in far greater numbers, China\u2019s fast-changing regulatory environment is creating uncertainty among foreign auto makers unsure about what Beijing\u2019s requirements will be.Current regulations also require manufacturers building electric cars in China to source all vehicle components locally. That presents a challenge for Tesla, which won\u2019t be able to use batteries made in its U.S. \u201cgigafactory\u201d in its Chinese-built cars, said       Bill Russo,        managing director of       Gao Feng       Advisory, a Shanghai-based auto consulting firm. Tesla might be forced to form a joint venture with a local battery maker, as well as a car maker, he said.Even so, Tesla has no choice but to manufacture vehicles in China, despite the regulatory uncertainties, in order to achieve scale and tap what is already the world\u2019s biggest market for electric cars, Mr. Russo said.\u201cOn a positive note, China is willing to allow the premier EV brand to plant its flag on Chinese soil,\u201d he said, referring to Tesla. \u201cTesla needs China. And China needs Tesla\u2014it wants to show they\u2019re not a closed ecosystem.\u201dRecent events signaled that Tesla is moving closer to committing to opening a factory in China, analysts said. Chinese internet company             Tencent Holdings Ltd.       acquired a 5% stake in Tesla for $1.78 billion in March, and Mr. Musk met with senior government officials in Beijing the following month.\u2014Junya Qian contributed to this article.Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com and Trefor Moss at Trefor.Moss@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 13:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-exploring-possibility-of-manufacturing-cars-in-china-1498145548", "news_title": "Tesla Explores Possibility of Manufacturing Cars in China ", "keywords": "auto maker,auto tariffs,china,china import tariffs,electric car sales,electric vehicles,elon musk,tesla,Tesla,TSLA,Tencent Holdings,0700.HK,Elon Musk,Bill Russo,plans,strategy,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive"}, {"content": "Senate Republicans on Thursday morning unveiled a \u201cdiscussion draft\u201d of their bill remaking much of the U.S. health-care system. The bill is expected to be considered on the Senate floor next week. Here\u2019s what to expect:Q: Will we learn how the Senate bill would affect insurance coverage in the country?A: Yes\u2014the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to release an estimate early next week of the bill\u2019s cost and how it would change the number of uninsured people compared with what would happen under the current law, the Affordable Care Act.Q: What will people be looking for in the CBO estimate?A: Last month, the office projected that the bill passed by the House in May would leave 23 million more people uninsured, compared with current law, and reduce the federal deficit by $119 billion in the next decade. Lawmakers will be looking to see whether the Senate bill would leave fewer people uninsured than the House bill and how it would affect the federal budget.Q: When will the bill come to the Senate floor?A: Senate aides expect that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) will bring the health bill as soon as Tuesday, shortly after the CBO score has been released. The first vote will be on a motion to proceed to the bill, which would need a simple majority to advance the bill. That means Mr. McConnell needs at least 50 votes, with Vice President       Mike Pence       on hand to break a tie.Q: How much debate will there be?A: Republicans are hoping to pass the bill under a process tied to the budget known as reconciliation that enables them to take advantage of several procedural shortcuts. One is that debate would be limited on the bill itself\u2014up to 20 hours, with 10 hours each for Republicans and Democrats.Q: Would lawmakers be able to offer amendments to the bill?A: Yes, lots! Once the 20 hours of debate are done, the Senate will conduct what is known as a \u201cvote-a-rama.\u201d In this bonanza of amendment votes, lawmakers from both parties are allowed to offer as many amendments as they would like, so long as they are considered \u201cgermane,\u201d or relevant to the bill. That\u2019s up to the Senate parliamentarian to decide, and in this case, it basically means the amendments have to be related to health care.Q: How long will the vote-a-rama last?A: That\u2019s hard to know\u2014it goes until senators stop offering amendments. To convince lawmakers to stop proposing amendments, Senate leaders must essentially wear them down. The strategy boils down to keeping lawmakers up so late that eventually everyone is too tired to go on. Aides think next week\u2019s vote-a-rama is likely to begin Thursday and stretch into Friday, though it\u2019s possible votes it could extend into the weekend.Q: How many votes does the bill need, and what happens if it fails?A: The bill will need 50 votes to pass, with the vice president breaking a tie. No Democrats are expected to vote for the bill, so Mr. McConnell can lose no more than two GOP votes. If he can\u2019t get 50 votes, Democrats and Republicans are expected to work together to pass some legislation shoring up the shaky marketplace where individuals can buy insurance if they don\u2019t get it through work or other government programs like Medicare or Medicaid.Q: What happens next if the Senate does pass the health-care bill?A: Both chambers have to pass the exact same bill, and there are a few ways for that to happen. The quickest option would probably be for the House to take up and vote on the Senate bill, but it\u2019s not yet clear if there is enough support in the House to pass it. If they did, it would go straight to the White House. The House could also tweak the Senate bill and send it back to the Senate, which would have to vote on the modified bill.Or GOP leaders in both chambers could put together a group tasked with forging a compromise between the House and Senate bills. The new compromise bill would then have to be approved by both the House and Senate. That process is the longest and least predictable. Many think GOP leaders are hoping the House would simply be able to pass the Senate bill.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'What to Expect Now In Legislative Process.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 13:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-to-expect-now-that-the-senate-health-bill-has-been-released-1498152087", "news_title": "What to Expect Now that the Senate Health Bill Has Been Released", "keywords": "political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house"}, {"content": "Humvee maker AM General is selling its light-vehicle assembly plant in Indiana to a China-backed company aiming to make electric cars, an abrupt shift for a factory that once built hulking Hummer H2 SUVs for General Motors Co.The $110 million purchase by a little-known company named SF Motors represents the latest foray by a startup with Chinese ties looking to expand its presence on U.S. soil. Many subsidiary companies operating in California have deep financial ties with much larger companies in China, where demand for electric vehicles is growing but engineering capabilities are limited.Electric cars have failed to gain traction in the U.S. market, but they are being introduced in droves as car companies aim to meet stricter regulations. Companies like SF, if successful with car buyers, can theoretically follow             Tesla Inc.\u2019s        TSLA -0.91%       lead in selling regulatory credits to established manufacturers who may need help meeting emissions standards because they primarily profit from selling trucks, SUVs and other vehicles with conventional gasoline engines.AM General is known for its deep ties to the defense industry, and it is unclear if those relationships present a challenge to closing the deal with SF. The agreement still needs to receive Chinese and U.S. regulatory approvals to close by the end of 2017 target.AM General developed the meaty Humvees, or \u201cHummer,\u201d decades ago and has been producing or developing rugged off-roaders, including Jeeps, for more than a century. Its light-vehicle plant, which is walled off from military-supply operations, has been underutilized since GM stopped making its controversial Hummer trucks about the time of its 2009 bankruptcy. At one point, it worked with             Ford Motor Co.       on electric vans.Officials said AM General\u2019s core defense business will remain completely separate from the China-backed EV venture. AM General said it would continue to center on its core operation of supplying military vehicles for the defense industry, including the iconic Humvee.SF is backed by Sokon Industry Group based in Chongqing, aims to start production of at least one electric car in South Bend, Ind., early next year. The company has a research facility near Detroit and counts a Tesla Inc. founder, Martin Eberhard, as a consultant, but it is racing against several conventional car companies and small startups\u2014including China-backed Faraday Future and Lucid Motors\u2014to deliver the types of compelling electric cars that Tesla is known for.SF follows a Michigan-based company called Rivian Automotive in buying an old car factory with the intention of refurbishing it for electric-vehicle production. Rivian, a company still in planning mode that consulted with former GM CEO Rick Wagoner in its early days, recently bought a former Mistubishi Motor Corp. plant in Normal, Ill.SF is committing to preserve AM General\u2019s 430 employees working on light-vehicle production, and it will invest $30 million in upgrades, according to a news release.\u201cThis announcement is great news for the Mishawaka community and the employees at this plant, and it sets the stage for a bright future and continued growth,\u201d Eric Holcomb, Indiana\u2019s governor, said in a statement.Most of the employees working in the AM General facility in South Bend have been building wagons for             Daimler AG\u2019s       Mercedes-Benz and custom vehicles for buyers with special needs, and are largely represented by the United Auto Workers union. The Daimler contract, however, is set to expire in October and there are currently no orders for the MV-1, a van designed specifically for use by people needing wheelchair access.Before the sale, AM General was working to secure new work for the commercial side of its business.

Ruben Gallego       (D., Ariz.) told CNN.\u201cLawyering up\u201d entered the popular lexicon back in the mid-1990s, thanks to the hit ABC police procedural, \u201cNYPD Blue,\u201d which aired from 1993 to 2005. Starting in the show\u2019s second season, the cops often spoke of suspects \u201clawyering up\u201d\u2014typically in ominous terms, when detectives became worried that they weren\u2019t going to extract the hoped-for confession.On an episode broadcast on Nov. 22, 1994,       Bobby Simone       (played by       Jimmy Smits      ) warned of one suspect, \u201cHe would lawyer up in 10 seconds.\u201d The following week, Detective Simone said of another character, \u201cHis father threatened to lawyer him up.\u201dWhen I checked with \u201cNYPD Blue\u201d co-creator       Steven Bochco,        he was quick to give credit for the use of the phrase to       Bill Clark,        who drew on his experience as a New York Police Department detective for more than two decades to ensure that the show remained authentic.Reached by phone, Mr. Clark said that by the second season, he had retired from the NYPD so that he could work full-time on the show as a writer and producer, entrusted by Mr. Bochco and his collaborator       David Milch       to craft stories from his own experience. Mr. Clark infused the scripts with police lingo like \u201clawyering up,\u201d \u201creaching out\u201d (for contacting someone who could help in a case) and \u201cskell\u201d (for a small-time perp).These bits of cop-speak became so associated with the show that TV critic       Alan Sepinwall       created a drinking game out of them, published on his website. Whenever anyone used \u201clawyer up,\u201d for instance, viewers had to take a drink. \u201cA lot of the show\u2019s slang tended to filter into the vernacular,\u201d said Mr. Sepinwall, who wrote for many years for the Star-Ledger newspaper in Newark, N.J.As for \u201clawyering up,\u201d Mr. Clark said it was a \u201csensitive expression\u201d for police detectives intent on eliciting confessions. \u201cIf a guy lawyered up, the ballgame\u2019s over as far as the interrogation goes,\u201d he said.At least two legal scholars have critiqued the show\u2019s depiction of \u201clawyering up.\u201d In a 1998 article for the journal Green Bag, law professors       Susan Bandes       and       Jack Beerman       said \u201cNYPD Blue\u201d gave the consistent impression that \u201clawyering up is the worst thing a suspect can do.\u201dNowadays the phrase applies to the hiring of attorneys more generally. Mr. Clark said he was happy that his introduction of \u201clawyering up\u201d to the show helped popularize the expression. Where will all the White House lawyering up end?

Then it met the \u201cKing of Good Times.\u201dVijay Mallya,        a billionaire fond of mullet haircuts, diamond earrings, sports and lavish parties, invited Diageo executives to his Mumbai residence in early 2012 and offered them a deal for a majority stake in India\u2019s largest liquor maker, which he controlled.Diageo was desperate to break into India and had long coveted             United Spirits Ltd.       As the two sides began discussions, the challenge of absorbing the company and its freewheeling founder became increasingly obvious. The liquor company was intricately, and confusingly, intertwined with Mr. Mallya\u2019s wider business empire, which was crumbling.His airline company was low on cash. To prop it up, he had advanced money from his liquor business, recording the payments on a handwritten ledger he showed the Diageo executives gathered in his home, according to two people familiar with the meeting and the ledger itself, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The Diageo executives also learned payments were being made to political figures in some key Indian states where United Spirits operated, the two people say.Diageo subsequently bought a 55% stake in United Spirits for $3.2 billion, the largest food-and-beverage transaction in Indian history. Five years later, its gamble on Mr. Mallya\u2019s business has made India the second-largest market for its brands, which include Johnnie Walker whisky and Smirnoff vodka. The man who orchestrated the deal for Diageo, then-Chief Operating Officer       Ivan Menezes,        has become chief executive.Yet the commercial success has been accompanied by lots of trouble. Diageo is in the crosshairs of Indian authorities and entangled in multiple legal proceedings stemming from the acquisition. The authorities are looking into whether Mr. Mallya used the deal to launder money, and Mr. Mallya\u2019s creditors have sought the return of shares purchased by Diageo.Mr. Mallya, who Diageo alleges diverted nearly $500 million from United Spirits and didn\u2019t pay it back, said in an email to the Journal that Diageo had \u201ccomplete knowledge\u201d of the money he had taken out of the company to support his other businesses. Diageo was \u201chappy with the transactions happening at United Spirits\u201d and \u201canalysed all the underlying documents\u201d before signing a deal, he said.Diageo spokesman       Dominic Redfearn       disputed Mr. Mallya\u2019s version of events. \u201cAt no time were we made aware of the diversions of funds that Dr. Mallya now suggests Diageo was \u2018happy with\u2019,\u201d Mr. Redfearn said in an email. \u201cHis claims that we \u2018analysed all the underlying documents\u2019 and were therefore \u2018happy with the transactions happening at USL\u2019 are false.\u201d He said \u201cevidence of diversion of funds only became clear after the closing of the transaction.\u201dLondon-based Diageo cut ties with Mr. Mallya last year, and he left India amid criminal investigations of unpaid debts and possible money laundering and tax evasion. He resurfaced in a London townhouse filled with impressionist art. India sought extradition, and bank creditors who claim they are owed $1.6 billion say they hope to see him imprisoned. In April, he was arrested in London and released on \u00a3650,000 bail, pending an extradition hearing.

With these enhancements, no longer do dolls need to stare blankly into the distance. Now playthings can appear to glance around the room or scrutinize you directly. Some can even alter their expression.\u201cThere\u2019s no limitation to what you can express through the eyes,\u201d said Jeremy Padawer, co-president and partner of Wicked Cool Toys, which makes a Cabbage Patch Kid and a soon-to-be-released Teddy Ruxpin with the feature.Hasbro                   introduced a Furby with digitally animated eyes in 2012, and ever since, skeptics have asked: Does creating more realistic toys stifle a child\u2019s imagination?This is a question Mr. Padawer has pondered at length. \u201cI have seen [children] have more fun with a cardboard box than some toys,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is providing tools to unlock some of the potential.... It\u2019s about variety at the end of the day.\u201dBelow, a guide to a handful of toys resolutely on the more-is-more end of the realism spectrum.This remote-control sports car, based on a character from Pixar\u2019s \u201cCars\u201d movies, comes fully loaded with a spirited personality.Recommended ages Kids should be old enough to safely commandeer an app-controlled vehicle that can do donuts on command and drive 6 mph.Realism Off the charts. A trapezoidal LCD screen renders the expressive Pixar-animated eyes, while motors tilt the chassis from side to side, giving this personified car real body language. Another giant leap forward: how Lightning McQueen\u2019s (non-LCD) lips sync smoothly with its speech\u2014a contrast to the primitive chomping action of other talking toys.Interaction style Dashing. In drive mode, Lightning McQueen will offer its unsolicited 2 cents (\u201cNice driving!\u201d) and comments relevant to its state of being (\u201cI feel a power nap coming on\u201d each time you turn it off.)Eerie or endearing? Endearing. It\u2019s hard to believe this isn\u2019t a Pixar character come to life. $300, sphero.comThis teched-out reinterpretation of the \u201980s toy phenomenon can perform typical behaviors for an interactive doll: cry when it\u2019s wet, giggle when tickled, snore after you rock it to sleep and burp contentedly after you pretend to feed it with a special bottle.Recommended ages 3 and up, according to the manufacturer.Realism Modest. Animated eyes can blink (digitally) and look around (inquisitively). But its mouth is static when it talks. As with other Cabbage Patch Kids, it\u2019s infused with a special \u201cbaby\u201d scent.Interaction style Demanding, as befits a toy designed to be \u201cnurtured.\u201d Sensors on its face allow the doll to play peekaboo; those on its body let it know when you\u2019ve changed its diaper. When it\u2019s sick, its cheeks glow red until you administer medicine.Eerie or endearing?

Very eerie. $90, cabbagepatchkids.comThe animatronic storytelling, learn-to-read teddy bear from the mid \u201980s makes a comeback with animated LCD eyes and stories that are downloaded via app rather than loaded on cassette tape.Recommended ages 3 and up: preschoolers and \u201cpre-readers\u201d (three read-along stories are included; more are available for purchase).Realism While the eyes are more lively than the original\u2019s, which could only manage a slow but charming blink, the motorized mouth does feel like a throwback. Eye animations sometimes veer into the fantastic (bouncing hearts, spinning globes), depending on the story being told.Interaction style Intentionally limited. Like its predecessor, this Teddy Ruxpin will only tell stories, not listen to yours.Eerie or endearing? Endearing, in a nostalgic way. And this Teddy Ruxpin is more huggable than the original.

The eyes are the only aspect of this toy that moves, and the animations are fairly subtle.Interaction style Wisecracking. The scripted jokes are squarely aimed at tween boys. A motion sensor in Spidey\u2019s chest allows it to react when you\u2019re nearby. Accelerometers enable it to respond when you move it.Eerie or endearing? Neither really, but there is something adorable about Spidey\u2019s squat physique. $150, sphero.comFurbies were bizarre when they first came out in the late 1990s\u2014and today\u2019s more lifelike version is even more so.Recommended ages Kids who are old enough to appreciate fart jokes (Furby flatulates gleefully) but won\u2019t be terrified by the creature\u2019s frantic squawking and gesticulating.Realism Impressive. Although the first Furby with LCD eyes was released in 2012, subtle tweaks to the sensors and motors in this latest iteration make its Gremlin-like kinesics and utterances seem exceptionally natural. The moving eyelids, ears, mouth and body (Furby has no arms) along with the digital eyes create a convincing effect.Interaction style Unabashedly manic. Accelerometers coupled with audio and touch sensors allow it to react to you. Tickle it, cradle it, pull its tail. All will get a rise out of this gibberish-spouting critter.Eerie or endearing? Both.

Sports like baseball, soccer and football have all been impacted. The head of a Mid-Atlantic officials association said the baseball umpire shortage was the worst in 25 years. In football, the referee pool dropped a grim 40%.Officiating youth sports isn\u2019t a glamour job, to say the least. The pay isn\u2019t life-changing, travel can be a pain, and it\u2019s often weekend and evening work. On top of that, you have to watch a lot of terrible youth sports.But numerous sources gave the Post a different reason for the current referee shortage:Parents.That\u2019s right: yelling, complaining, entitled, know-it-all, rotten, difficult, impossible, no-good parents\u2014driving away perfectly decent citizens making small wages trying to help their children play meaningless games for exercise and fun.\u201cThere\u2019s no moral fiber left in our society,\u201d Dennis Hall, the Virginia Football Officials Association commissioner, told the Post. \u201cPeople think because they paid to get into the game, they can say and do anything they want, and they think they know the rules better than the officials because they watch television.\u201dYowza. Just out of curiosity: What is the penalty for the decline of moral fiber in society?It\u2019s got to be at least 15 yards.I read the Post story with a combination of horror and utter lack of surprise. If you\u2019ve ever walked within a quarter mile of a youth sporting event in America, you\u2019ve probably witnessed some ugly parental behavior. As a former Little League ump and youth basketball ref, I\u2019m sadly familiar with the rage of fathers and mothers\u2014as well as their spittle.It sounds like things today are far, far worse.I\u2019ve never understood crazy sports parents\u2014what motivates an otherwise law-abiding citizen to act out on the sidelines of a game played by children. What satisfaction do they find by hounding coaches for playing time, or harassing referees for perceived mistakes? Do these parents think they\u2019re being constructive? Are they acting out past childhood traumas? Are they Knicks fans?It\u2019s tempting to see a correlation between the decline of civility in American public life and parental obnoxiousness in sports. If we can\u2019t board an airplane without the chance of a fistfight\u2014or log on to Facebook without being bombarded by all-caps invective from relatives we never even knew we had\u2014it\u2019s no wonder that a kiddie soccer game could lead to adult-size trouble.It doesn\u2019t make it any less pathetic. For all the talk radio ranting about everybody-gets-a-trophy culture in youth sports, it\u2019s parents who are truly the toxic sauce. The Post story makes clear: Referees are not quitting because everybody\u2019s getting a trophy. They\u2019re quitting because they\u2019re sick of parents chasing them to their Mazdas in the parking lot.And we haven\u2019t even gotten to the impact upon the kids themselves, looking over at the sidelines and seeing Dad and Mom behaving like deranged lunatics. What is the long-term cost there?I guess I could come up with some long-term strategy here, in which I propose an awareness campaign and a cultural shift in which parents learn to respect refs and coaches and stop obsessing over 12-and-under games. That\u2019s a nice if quixotic idea, and I encourage anyone to pursue it.For the record, I\u2019m also OK with light prison sentences for bad sports parents. They don\u2019t have to be imprisoned with the general population\u2014just keep them in a separate wing where they can prep snacks and orange slices.I doubt I can rally support for incarceration, however. So I\u2019m suggesting something else:A plastic box.That\u2019s right: a 10-by-10 plexiglass box, with small air holes at the top, set down on the sidelines of all youth sports fields in America. Problem parents would be escorted into the plastic box, where they could yell and scream and rudely gesticulate as much as they wanted, and the coaches, referees and the rest of us could enjoy the game in peace.I don\u2019t mean to brag, but I think this idea is a winner. I believe there\u2019ll be parents who will volunteer to stand in the plastic box.(I know you\u2019re worried about costs, but it wouldn\u2019t be so expensive. Just put a small tax on every uniform or ice cream sold at the ice cream truck. Parents are already paying a fortune for youth sports\u2014they won\u2019t even notice the plastic box tax.)Yes: we\u2019ve got to do better as a country. We\u2019ve allowed human interaction to coarsen to the point where courtesy feels not like a baseline requirement, but a luxury. We\u2019ve got to stop all the useless yelling: in the workplace, in politics, online, and definitely on the youth sports arena.Until then, however, I suggest a plastic box.Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-22 12:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lets-put-bad-sports-parents-in-a-box-1498150200", "news_title": "Let\u2019s Put Bad Sports Parents in a Box", "keywords": "jason gay,referee,umpire,youth athletics,youth sports,youth sports referees,sports,recreation,commentaries,opinions,routine general news"}, {"content": "Sears Canada Inc.        SCC -22.50%       filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada Thursday, saying it will close a quarter of stores and lay off roughly 2,900 employees.Sears Canada, which operates more than 200 stores, is seeking protection from creditors under Canada\u2019s Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, the equivalent of chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S., and intends to leave bankruptcy \u201cas soon as possible in 2017.\u201dThe company, which has operated at loss since 2014, said in court papers it has struggled with the \u201cgeneral weakening of the traditional Canadian retail industry,\u201d along with the weakening Canadian dollar, on top of the decline of its catalog business and expensive real estate costs. Liquidity pressures and \u201clegacy components\u201d the business are stalling efforts to reinvent the business, the company said.The Wall Street Journal reported news of the impending filing Wednesday.Sears Canada, one of the largest multiformat retailers in Canada, operates 225 stores across the country and employs roughly 17,000 people. The company said it plans to close 20 full-line locations, as well as 15 Sears Home stores, 10 outlets and 14 Sears Hometown locations. The timing of the store closings has yet to be finalized. The company is also cutting jobs at its Toronto headquarters.Meanwhile, the company said its monthly pension payments to eligible beneficiaries of the Sears Canada pension plan assets won\u2019t be affected by the initial filing, and beneficiaries will continue to receive their payments under the terms of the plan.Sears Canada said in court papers it has been making monthly installments of about $3.7 million toward a component of its pension plan, which has a \u201chypothetical wind up deficit\u201d of about $266.8 million.\u201cThe funding deficit has become a significant risk and impediment to the Sears Canada Group\u2019s ongoing business,\u201d the company said in court papers.Sears Holdings Corp.        SHLD -3.66%       spun off the Canadian retail chain in 2012, one of several moves by the hedge-fund manager to keep the U.S.-based retailer afloat. But like its U.S. namesake, Sears Canada has been shutting stores and struggling with several years of losses.Eddie Lampert,        chief executive of Sears Holdings, is still the largest shareholder of both Sears Holdings and Sears Canada. Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc., and affiliates owned about 45% of the company\u2019s shares outstanding as of April 26. Sears Holdings owns about 12% of Sears Canada.Court papers show that at Sears Canada\u2019s request, ESL Investments can provide investment, business and real estate consulting services, without charge.Earlier this year Sears Holdings, which runs Sears and Kmart stores, raised doubts in public filings about its ability to keep operating after seven years of losses. The company announced last week it would slash 400 jobs from its corporate headquarters as it continues to push through its turnaround.Sears Canada said last week it was considering a restructuring or sale because its cash-flow forecasts weren\u2019t sufficient to meet debt payments and other obligations over the next 12 months.Sears Canada shares closed at 62 Canadian cents Wednesday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, down 72% this year.Sears has struggled to tap into the Canadian market, competing with online retailers and entrenched Canadian outlets such as the country\u2019s iconic department store,             Hudson\u2019s Bay.Sears Canada posted a fiscal 2016 loss of 321 million Canadian dollars (about $240.6 million) as revenue fell to C$2.6 billion, down from C$4.3 billion four years earlier. Sears Canada had total assets of C$1.24 billion as of Jan. 28 and total liabilities of C$1.02 billion.In April, Sears Canada entered an agreement with Great American Capital Partners LLC and KKR Capital Markets LLC to borrow C$300 million, of which C$125 million was drawn down immediately.Sears Canada was able to line up a C$450 million bankruptcy loan from its pre-petition lenders, which include Wells Fargo Capital Finance Corp. and GACP Finance Co. LLC. The financing will be used toward keeping its business afloat during the proceedings.FTI Consulting Canada Inc.       has been appointed the monitor of the Canadian proceedings.\u2014Austen Hufford contributed to this article.Write to Lillian Rizzo at Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com and Jacquie McNish at Jacquie.McNish@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 12:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sears-canada-seeks-bankruptcy-protection-1498137009", "news_title": "Sears Canada to Cut Jobs, Stores as It Enters Bankruptcy Protection", "keywords": "bankruptcynews,canada,eddie lampert,esl investments,kmart,sears,sears canada,sears holdings,Sears Holdings,SHLD,Sears Canada,SCC.T,CA:SCC,plans,strategy,bankruptcy,labor,personnel,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,lay-offs,redundancies,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,department stores"}, {"content": "Friday marks a year since the British referendum vote to leave the European Union. The 12 months leading up to this week\u2019s start of negotiations haven\u2019t been auspicious.Both sides have traded insults. \u201cThe hostile, almost juvenile, rhetoric from both London and Brussels has been deeply worrisome and needs to stop,\u201d said       Tim Cullen,        director of the Oxford University Program on Negotiation.If Brussels has unhelpfully scaled up some of its demands, with officials suggesting privately that the U.K. might face a bill of \u20ac60 billion to \u20ac100 billion ($111 billion) or more on departure, London seems to have forgotten some important rules of international negotiations. Among them: This isn\u2019t poker and it isn\u2019t war.The EU has been much more explicit about its opening positions on the negotiations. The U.K. has been less so, perhaps because it is still working them out. But Prime Minister       Theresa May       has suggested another motive, saying she wouldn\u2019t give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on Brexit negotiations in order not to \u201creveal our hand prematurely\u201d to the EU.Simon Tilford,        deputy director of the pro-EU Center for Economic Reform, says this approach misunderstands the nature of such negotiations. It isn\u2019t poker because you can\u2019t hide your cards.\u201cThe British government cannot engage in bluff because the EU knows exactly what cards Britain holds, and they know they\u2019re not very good. Britain can walk away, but the EU sees that as an empty threat,\u201d he said.Ngaire Woods,        dean of Oxford University\u2019s Blavatnik School of Government, says the U.K. has made other classic negotiating mistakes. The first was to imagine it is going into battle.This approach encourages negotiators to obscure their real intentions so as to defeat their foes, probably with a last-minute, elaborate deception along the lines of D-Day. \u201cBut Brexit is not D-Day,\u201d Ms. Woods argues in an article for Project Syndicate. The U.K. isn\u2019t trying to defeat enemies but attempting to preserve a mutually beneficial relationship with nearby countries.Another mistake has been to create unrealistic expectations about the outcome of the negotiations, which risks sowing disillusionment when inevitably they aren\u2019t met. There is no chance, Ms. Woods says, that the U.K. will walk away with a bespoke trade agreement with the EU in the allotted two years of negotiations, as some British officials have suggested.The U.K. has also erred, she says, by focusing exclusively on its own interests. Every specialist on negotiations advises that understanding the other parties\u2019 interests collectively and individually is essential for success.The EU knows what the U.K. says it wants: Mrs. May repeated this week that Brexit \u201cis about building a new, deep and special partnership with our European friends and neighbors.\u201d But exactly what that means and what obligations Britain will be willing to accept to secure this partnership are still unknown.In the past, British ministers have boasted that they see themselves in the driver\u2019s seat. Brexit minister       David Davis,        speaking in October, suggested Germany\u2019s desire for free trade in cars and access to the City of London\u2019s financial center were just two among many issues that gave the U.K. the upper hand in the talks.\u201cIn many areas\u2014not just the City, and not just as regards cars\u2014the balance of negotiating advantage is incredibly heavily stacked our way,\u201d Mr. Davis told Parliament.\u2018The basic fact remains that the U.K. is in a weak position because of the disparity in size.\u2019European officials don\u2019t see it that way, saying what gives them clout in the negotiations is size:\u00a0The EU economy is far more important than the U.K.\u2019s. EU exports to the U.K. represent about 3% of the bloc\u2019s economic activity while U.K. exports to the EU more than 12% of British output. The British capitulation to the EU\u2019s negotiating timetable this week emphasizes which is the stronger party, they say.In their public statements, EU governments have repeated their priority is maintaining the bloc\u2019s unity. They want a close economic relationship with the U.K., including with its car industry and the City of London. But they are convinced they can cope with the economic fallout from a failure to secure an agreement\u2014something they believe would create an economic disaster for the U.K. They don\u2019t take seriously, therefore, Mrs. May\u2019s suggestion that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal.\u201d\u201cThe basic fact remains that the U.K. is in a weak position because of the disparity in size,\u201d       Bruno Ma\u00e7\u00e3es,        a former Portuguese secretary for European affairs, told the Royal United Services Institute. \u201cWhat I hear from all sides in Brussels is that the EU has very few things it either needs or wants from the U.K.\u201dThe one issue sometimes mentioned, he said later, is for the U.K. to commit not to use tax and regulation aggressively to undercut the EU\u2019s competitiveness. Other than that, he said, when he asked Brussels-based bureaucrats what the EU wanted from Britain, \u201cI just drew blank stares.\u201dWrite to Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 12:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/britain-shouldnt-mistake-brexit-talks-for-poker-or-war-1498149867", "news_title": "Britain Shouldn\u2019t Mistake Brexit Talks for Poker or War ", "keywords": "brexit,European Union,British government,Theresa May,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Santa Fe, N.M.\u2014An eccentric millionaire, who claims to have hidden gold and gems in the mountains of northern New Mexico, is considering calling off the legendary treasure hunt after a man died recently looking for the bounty.Antiques dealer       Forrest Fenn,        whose treasure hunt has drawn thousands to the Rocky Mountains north of Santa Fe, said the death of Paris Wallace, a Colorado pastor, has compelled him to re-examine the popular search.\u201cI am thinking about several options, including stopping the search,\u201d he said. \u201cI have consulted several friends who are helping me decide.\u201dSometime in mid-June, Mr. Wallace set out from his home in Grand Junction, Colo., and headed for New Mexico\u2014hoping, like so many others before him, to find the chest of gold that Mr. Fenn had supposedly hidden there.On Sunday, two rafters discovered what police believe was the body of Mr. Wallace, 52 years old, floating in the Rio Grande River, not far from the rugged area where he was searching.In recent days, New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas has called for Mr. Fenn to end the quest, saying it had gotten too dangerous.\u201cI guarantee you that if this continues, there will be more people lost, more searches launched, and more people are going to die,\u201d Chief Kassetas said. \u201cThe question I have for Mr. Fenn is what can we do to avoid it? Is there a better way to get people up off their couch and explore New Mexico than doing it this way?\u201dMr. Fenn, 86, who lives in Santa Fe, said he respected Chief Kassetas, but wasn\u2019t yet certain how he was going to proceed.For seven years now, droves of people have journeyed to the area, looking for Mr. Fenn\u2019s treasure, guided by clues laid out in his 2010 memoir.Some occasionally have become lost on their quest, though authorities said they didn\u2019t know the precise number. One man stalked Mr. Fenn\u2019s granddaughter, believing she was the \u201ctreasure\u201d Mr. Fenn was writing about.Mr. Fenn, a former Vietnam War fighter pilot, included a poem in his self-published memoir, \u201cThe Thrill of the Chase,\u201d with nine clues supposedly scattered within the stanzas, along with a map that promised to lead people to the buried treasure chest.Begin it where warm waters haltAnd take it in the canyon down,Not far, but too far to walk.Put in below the home of Brown.Mr. Fenn says he has indeed hidden a bronze chest filled with 20.2 troy pounds of gold, valuable prehistoric bracelets, necklaces and gems. Some treasure hunters have estimated the bounty\u2019s worth at between $1 million and $2 million. Mr. Fenn says it\u2019s impossible to put a value on the treasure because the price of gold is ever changing.As Mr. Fenn has dangled additional clues over the years, the hunt has lured people to New Mexico from all over the world\u2014upward of 100,000 over the past seven years, according to Dal Neitzel, a Washington man who has devoted a blog to the hunt.An annual gathering called Fennboree has even sprung up in New Mexico, where treasure hunters and their families camp out and swap tales of their efforts to unravel Mr. Fenn\u2019s great mystery.But the riddle has never been solved. And some have questioned whether there\u2019s really any buried treasure at all.Chief Kassetas has said if the bounty does indeed exist, then Mr. Fenn should pull it from the ground. The latest search had forced volunteer rescue workers to operate in dangerous terrain as they scoured for signs of Mr. Wallace, he said.Mr. Wallace\u2019s wife, Mitzi, initially contacted police on June 14, the day he was supposed to return home, saying she had last heard from him the day before.Mr. Wallace told his wife that he was off to search for the treasure, packing plenty of food, clothes and his laptop, which he\u2019d used to map coordinates of the caramel-colored canyons and cliffs near Taos where he thought it might be located, a police report said.During their search for him, police discovered in his motel room the laptop with the mapping coordinates, which in turn led them to his vehicle, where they found climbing ropes fastened to a large rock.Ms. Wallace told the Associated Press that she would carry on her husband\u2019s search for the treasure with her son.Mr. Fenn called Mr. Wallace\u2019s death a \u201cterrible tragedy,\u201d saying that it had affected him \u201cin a profound way.\u201d\u201cMy prayers go out to Pastor Wallace\u2019s wife, his friends and his congregation,\u201d he said in an email.Mr. Wallace isn\u2019t the only person to perish in the search for treasure. Last summer, following an extensive search, the body of 54-year-old Randy Bilyeu was discovered along the Rio Grande River not far from Santa Fe.Mr. Bilyeu, who had moved to Colorado from Florida to look for the treasure, had gone missing about seven months earlier after setting out with a raft and his dog, Leo. Mr. Fenn said he\u2019d chartered a helicopter at one point in the hopes of finding the missing man.Mr. Bilyeu\u2019s ex-wife, Linda, has since spoken out against the hunt, writing an open letter to Mr. Fenn, in which she blamed him for using clues to manipulate treasure seekers like her husband.Ms. Bilyeu called on Mr. Fenn to come forward and admit the treasure is a hoax, saying that she believes more will get hurt or die if the search continues. \u201cI think [Mr. Fenn] has dug himself into a big hole and he does not know how to get out of it,\u201d Ms. Bilyeu said in an interview.Mr. Neitzel, the blogger, said criticism of Mr. Fenn was unfair and that people are responsible for their own actions when they decide to head out into the wilderness. He himself claims to have searched in vain for the treasure more than 65 times.\u201cWhat kid hasn\u2019t pretended he was on a boat and waved a stick in the air pretending it was a sword, pretending to look for lost treasure?\u201d he said. \u201cSo why not do it for real?

There is bound to be some friction, for instance over changes to America\u2019s H-1B visa program for skilled workers. But the two democracies have many interests in common, the most significant being energy.The U.S. and India were the biggest losers from the Paris climate accord. The U.S. decision to pull out should embolden India to do the same, and the two could cooperate on building the clean-coal energy infrastructure that India needs to grow its economy.At the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference, China and India together sank Western attempts to agree on a comprehensive climate treaty. But       Xi Jinping\u2019s       accession in 2012 saw a sea change in Chinese policy and a new openness to multilateral approaches. This was seized on by the Obama administration, which negotiated the November 2014 U.S.-China climate deal that paved the way for the 2015 Paris accord.When it comes to energy policy, China and India have divergent interests. China has many features of development maturity. While China\u2019s per capita electricity consumption of 3,927 kWh in 2014 is lower than Western Europe\u2019s, it is similar to countries such as Hungary and Poland.As the world\u2019s largest producer of solar photovoltaic panels, and with the ambition and means to achieve the same in wind power, China has a mercantilist interest in promoting renewable energy while remaining heavily dependent on coal.India is in a different place. At 804 kWh, its per capita electricity consumption is little more than 20% of China\u2019s. Even after two years of declining coal consumption, China\u2019s increase in coal usage over the past 10 years exceeded India\u2019s total consumption in 2016.China can afford the rich man\u2019s illusion of cheap renewable energy. It runs large trade surpluses and has $3 trillion in foreign-currency reserves. India has sizeable current-account deficits and reserves of $380 billion.In the 2014 elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party came to power promising to bring electricity to every village by 2022. Mr. Modi and his ministers know they can only deliver this promise with coal. According to India\u2019s Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, coal accounted for 60.8% of India\u2019s installed capacity and \u201cwill continue to dominate power generation in future.\u201dFrom 2006 to 2016, Indian coal consumption increased by 88%, in 2015 overtaking the U.S. to become the world\u2019s second-largest coal market. New Delhi plans to replace coal-fired power stations that are more than 25 years old with modern, supercritical plants. That should boost power-station thermal efficiency by nearly 70%, thereby lowering emissions. India\u2019s energy minister,       Piyush Goyal,        calculates that modernizing India\u2019s coal generation will have a far greater impact on reducing emissions than the Paris accord\u2019s emphasis on renewable energy.Meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary       Rick Perry       at the Clean Energy Ministerial meeting in Beijing earlier this month, India\u2019s science and technology minister, Harsh Vardhan, commented that there had hardly been any mention of climate change. \u201cThey are pushing for clean coal,\u201d he said of the Americans.Under the Obama administration, there had not been much interest. \u201cSince you have taken interest,\u201d Mr. Vardhan said to Mr. Perry, \u201cwe can collaborate on the development of clean-coal technology.\u201dThe fly in the ointment is India\u2019s ambitious plans for wind and solar energy. Unlike cellular technology, which enables developing nations to leapfrog fixed-wire telephony, wind and solar energy are intermittent and therefore not reliable substitutes for dependable coal-generated power.As Mr. Perry has noted, a reliable and resilient electric system is essential for public health, economic growth and job creation. The high fixed costs and zero marginal costs of wind and solar mean wholesale electricity prices trend towards zero, while their intermittency means gas, coal and nuclear plants operate less efficiently. But in the end the same amount of thermal-generating capacity is still needed, multiplying the investment required to fully electrify the Indian subcontinent.Currently India\u2019s leading electric companies, such as NTPC and             Tata Power,       generate the healthy profits necessary to build out the Indian grid. But this won\u2019t last, if Germany\u2019s example is anything to go by. In the seven years from December 2007, three German utilities saw the destruction of \u20ac68.9 billion ($76.77 billion) in shareholder value.Wholesale electricity prices in India are already plunging. Over the past nine years, thermal-generating capacity utilization has fallen to 60% from 79%. Germany can tolerate this kind of value destruction because it has a working grid. Young, fast-growing economies like India\u2019s can\u2019t.Much of the blame for the renewables push rests on international development agencies. The World Bank\u2019s 2016 Climate Action Plan promotes renewable energy as essential to stabilizing the climate, but it doesn\u2019t mention the damaging impact of intermittency on the long-term health of the grid.Putting more wind and solar energy on India\u2019s grid will push up costs and retard Indians\u2019 access to cheap, reliable power. Ultimately it risks locking India in permanent economic inferiority to China. That outcome isn\u2019t in the interests of India or America. Whatever Mr. Modi says about India\u2019s continued participation in the Paris agreement, as a political leader he has something in common with Mr. Trump: He will put his country\u2019s interests first.Mr. Darwall is the author of \u201cThe Age of Global Warming: A History\u201d (Quartet, 2013).", "news_time": "2017-06-22 12:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/indias-problem-with-renewable-energy-1498149487", "news_title": "India\u2019s Problem With Renewable Energy", "keywords": " coal, donald trump,india, narendra modi, renewable energy, solar, wind,political,general news,climate change,international relations,natural environment,global,world issues,politics,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,energy,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,renewable energy generation,machinery,electric utilities,industrial goods,renewable energy equipment,utilities"}, {"content": "Jason Furman and Rohit Kumar (\u201cDon\u2019t Raise the Debt Limit\u2014Repeal It,\u201d op-ed, June 20) repeat a familiar argument. Since Congress approves federal spending in its budget process, the federal debt is merely a consequence of its previously approved spending. So the debt limit should not be an issue.This argument fails to take into account the price of money. Congress has no say about interest rates. Yet paying interest on the federal debt is part of the budget. When those rates go up, that part of the budget rises without congressional and presidential approval. Raising the debt limit, or not, allows Congress and the president a say on this part of the budget.Michael Y. Warder Sr.Upland, Calif.The authors fail to take into account the assets of the federal government in dealing with its budget. Contrary to their conclusion that a default would result if Congress approves deficit spending without borrowings, the government, just like anyone else, can sell its assets to finance excessive spending. The estimated $120 trillion net worth of the federal government should not be put off the table in dealing with its $20 trillion debt.Prof. Oscar VarelaUniversity of Texas at El PasoMessrs.

Doing so would deprive elected politicians an opportunity to pontificate and obstruct to create the illusion of fiscal discipline.Richard ChambersBarrington, Ill.The authors say default is less likely if the debt limit is repealed. If Congress continues unrestrained spending, I want something that reminds the members they are spending somebody else\u2019s money. Some difficult decisions by Congress would cause definite short-term hardship, reduce the debt and strengthen the economy. Congress never shows any fiscal responsibility that might cost a vote.

Even after being found guilty, Mexico continued to violate U.S. trade law. American farmers suffered, factories closed, workers lost jobs and taxpayers were harmed as a result.Amazingly you leave out these important facts as you criticize the Trump administration for enforcing U.S. law and holding Mexico accountable.

The Kansas PIT-base design could serve as a prototype for a compromise federal income-tax blueprint.

Tensions have been high, as residents who have lived under three years of brutal occupation clamor for retribution, sometimes with public protests.The federal government fears that large-scale retaliation could inflame resentments. Iraqi Prime Minister       Haider al-Abadi,        once criticized for being slow to address the issue, has said a family should not be punished for the crimes of just one person, citing verses from the Quran to support his position.He has empowered federal forces\u2014the only ones with any real power\u2014to prevent such punishments, either through force or by refusing to take part in such efforts. A member of the National Security Service, the country\u2019s intelligence force, near Mosul said it has orders to prevent a deportation from Mosul.Mr. Abadi       has been in conversation with local lawmakers to try to forestall such measures and routinely mentions the issue in his weekly addresses to the nation. When protests happen, representatives of the federal government have been known to calm the situation.During its 2014 blitz though vast swaths of the country, the Sunni radicals of Islamic State took over much of the three Sunni-majority provinces of Shiite-dominated Iraq\u2014Anbar, Salahuddin and Nineveh, where Mosul is located. As Islamic State loses territory to Iraqi forces, families across the country who have been pushed out of their homes can end up in displaced person camps with no real prospects.\u201cKicking out Daesh families is a key thing and a natural reaction by people to what they have been subject to by Daesh terrorists,\u201d       Zuhair al-Jabouri,        a Mosul district councilman, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State, said following the Monday vote. The council which was exiled to nearby Erbil during Islamic State occupation, reformed in Mosul after much of the city was retaken.While Mosul councilmen have said they hope the families will be sent to some sort of rehabilitation camp, the governor of neighboring Salahuddin province said Wednesday that he would refuse to accept any of those expelled.\u201cLet deported Daesh families go somewhere else,\u201d said       Khalid al-Khazraji,        a Salahuddin provincial council member. \u201cWe try to keep our province safe.\u201dMosul\u2019s city council would need approval from higher-ranking provincial authorities to enforce the ordinance. Officials in Nineveh province have indicated they could approve the move as soon as next week.\u201cA few days ago....thousands of people protested against the presence of Daesh families in Mosul and tried to attack such families and kick them out,\u201d said       Mohamed Ibrahim,        head of Nineveh provincial council\u2019s security committee. \u201cWe should deal with it quickly before things get out of control.\u201dIn Anbar, tribal authorities came together last year to expel such families from their homes in cities, and eventually the provincial government also supported the move, saying that leaving families in place could foster a cycle of revenge.At the time, the central government did little to prevent such actions.\u201cIt was incredibly disturbing to see last year that you had provincial councils pass this without any pushback from Baghdad,\u201d said       Belkis Wille,        senior Iraq researcher with Human Rights Watch, who said the recent action from Mr. Abadi is crucial because the federal government is the main bulwark against local retribution.\u201cBaghdad has taken too long to respond. But now that they\u2019re responding, that\u2019s a very positive thing,\u201d she added.Baghdad hasn\u2019t tried to resettle such families in their old homes, some of which have been destroyed.In makeshift housing outside a village in Anbar, 65-year-old       Ahmed Agool       said he hasn\u2019t been allowed to return to his home in the Anbar city of Khaldiya, where his house was destroyed during the military operation against Islamic State. \u201cEveryone blames me because of my son who joined Daesh.\u201dThe man, who has lost everything, laments his son\u2019s decision to join Islamic State and the authorities\u2019 refusal to believe his disapproval of it.\u201cI denounced my son,\u201d he said. \u201cI went to the court in Ramadi and the police office there and denounced my son because he joined Daesh.\u201d But that changed nothing, he said.Appeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Mosul Aims to Oust Militants\u2019 Families.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 12:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mosul-seeks-to-expel-families-of-islamic-state-members-1498148625", "news_title": "Mosul Seeks to Expel Families of Islamic State Members ", "keywords": "iraq conflict,iraq war,islamic state,middle east,mosul,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,terrorism"}, {"content": "DUBAI\u2014Now that he has secured his place as next in line to the Saudi throne,       Mohammed bin Salman       faces his next big test: overhauling the kingdom\u2019s ailing economy.As deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman last year championed a plan to transform the kingdom\u2019s oil-dependent economy by creating jobs, boosting the private sector and attracting foreign capital.But more than a year later, the so-called Vision 2030 reform plan has made little headway. Saudi Arabia\u2019s revenues are still largely reliant on oil sales and with crude prices low, the kingdom has been forced to borrow heavily to shore up its finances.The troubles bolster a perception that now-Crown       Prince Mohammed       has been fast to promise and slow to deliver. More important, they raise the prospect that the most unpopular economic reforms he has promoted could be reversed.\u201cThe promulgation of the new vision went at supersonic speed,\u201d said Florence Eid-Oakden, chief economist at Arabia Monitor, a London-based research and strategy firm. \u201cThe implementation is going more slowly.\u201dThe crown prince\u2019s push for reform has come up hard against the bureaucratic and legal obstacles that have long made Saudi Arabia a difficult place to do business. In the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business Index, Saudi Arabia ranks 94 out of 190 economies. For ease in starting a business, the kingdom ranks 147, trailing Gulf neighbors Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.There also remain pockets of resistance to reform among members of the royal family, the religious establishment, the business elite and the civil service, analysts say.Not all members of the Allegiance Council, which has the final say over the issue of succession in the Saudi royal family, voted in favor of Prince Mohammed\u2019s promotion. This suggests there are still some in the royal family who aren\u2019t fully behind him.Still, some analysts say the crown prince is better positioned to push ahead with reform now that he is next in line to the Saudi throne, supplanting his more-cautious cousin       Mohammed bin Nayef.       He can consolidate domestic power and more effectively counter opposition to the 2030 plan, these people say, and eventually redirect and revitalize the region\u2019s biggest economy.\u201cThe change in succession cements the prospects of the successful implementation of Vision 2030,\u201d said Giyas Gokkent, an economist at the Institute of International Finance, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing global financial institutions.Just hours before Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s promotion was announced Wednesday, index provider             MSCI Inc.       said that it would consider classifying the kingdom as an emerging market as early as next year, a move that could draw billions of dollars to the economy.During his recent visit to Saudi Arabia, U.S. President       Donald Trump       also provided a vote of confidence. He was accompanied by a large delegation of prominent business leaders eager to explore opportunities in the kingdom and betting that its economic liberalization will prove profitable.Banks such as             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. play a key role in advising and financing Vision 2030 reforms, such as the listing of Saudi National Oil Co, or Aramco, a state asset that the new crown prince has previously valued at $2 trillion.             Citigroup Inc.       recently obtained a much-coveted banking license.             General Electric Co.       and other companies have pledged to invest billions of dollars in the Saudi economy.\u201cIt is a market where you more likely than not want to be present,\u201d said Sjoerd Leenart, head of J.P. Morgan for the Middle East, Africa and Turkey. But he added: \u201cThose looking for the quick buck will not succeed.\u201dWhile the Saudi government is on track with some of its 2030 targets such as reducing the fiscal budget, it lags behind in others.The $200 billion program to privatize state entities, airports and utilities has moved slowly. Even the Aramco IPO is facing delays because of its complexity, though Saudi officials say it will still take place in 2018 as scheduled. The listing of Aramco is to provide the country\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund with the resources for investment abroad.Still there are other signs that reforms are going to be painful and require more time, and may not be implemented if domestic pressures prove too severe.In late April, the Saudi government reinstated benefits for government employees that were among the most publicized austerity cuts introduced last year. On Wednesday, the same day Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s appointment as crown prince was announced, the government went a step further and reimbursed government workers for the benefits they weren\u2019t paid.To make ends meet, Saudi Arabia raised $17.5 billion through an international bond sale last year\u2014the biggest ever by an emerging economy\u2014and secured a $10 billion loan. This year, it raised $9 billion in its debut international Islamic bond sale.Those fresh funds, however, haven\u2019t prevented the kingdom\u2019s net foreign reserves from sinking to just below $500 billion, the lowest level in 6 years.With government funds for big projects drying up, construction firms have fired more than a 100,000 workers. Saudi Binladin group, the country\u2019s largest and most prominent construction firm, laid off close to 70,000 workers last year to avoid financial collapse.The tensions generated by the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen and efforts to isolate neighboring Qatar are rising as Saudi Arabia faces growing economic pressures at home. Unemployment remains high at around 12% while the economy\u2014expanding at an estimated 0.1% this year\u2014isn\u2019t growing fast enough to create enough new jobs.\u201cThe biggest issue he faces is that he\u2019s waded into centuries-old conflicts that are difficult to resolve in the short term,\u201d said Arabia Monitor\u2019s Eid-Oakden. \u201cThese are long-term issues, but he needs to produce short-term results.\u201dWrite to Nicolas Parasie at nicolas.parasie@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Fixing Economy Will Test Saudi Heir.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 12:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/first-test-for-saudi-arabias-king-in-waiting-fixing-the-economy-1498146003", "news_title": "First Test for Saudi Arabia\u2019s King-in-Waiting: Fixing the Economy", "keywords": "saudi arabia economy,saudi arabia politics,economic performance,indicators,economic news"}, {"content": "\u201cIT\u2019S LIKE BEING in someone\u2019s pantry,\u201d said Kate Bosworth last Thursday night. \u201cA very, very fancy pantry.\u201d The actress was in the tony New York food shop Clover Grocery, marveling at shelves filled with $13 jars of Himalayan salt.

The group has carried out attacks in the past targeting civilians and government employees in Kabul Bank branches.\u201cThe car bomb hit a crowd of people who had gathered to withdraw cash from the bank,\u201d Mr. Zwak said. \u201cCivilians and government employees are among the casualties.\u201d In addition to the 34 killed, he said more than 60 people were wounded, most of them civilians.The Taliban have expanded territory under their control in Helmand province, capturing many districts and closing in on the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. The deteriorating security situation in the province has led to the redeployment of hundreds of U.S. Marines after their full withdrawal in 2014.There are 8,500 American troops in the country, along with 6,500 troops representing members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .In recent weeks following the Taliban spring offensive, Afghanistan has witnessed attacks including a truck bombing late last month in the capital Kabul that killed more than 150 people.The Afghan government blamed a Taliban offshoot, the Haqqani network, which is closely tied to al-Qaeda and the Pakistani spy agency, and ordered the executions of 11 members of the group. The Taliban vowed to retaliate if the government carries out the executions.The Taliban-led insurgency has swept across rural areas and is threatening at least a half dozen provincial capitals. The militants are exploiting a vacuum left after most foreign troops withdrew from the country in 2014.Amid the deteriorating security situation, President       Donald Trump       this month gave the Pentagon unilateral authority to send thousands of new U.S. troops to Afghanistan.

The San Francisco-based companies have slugged it out with competing fare cuts to woo customers, and dueling subsidies to poach drivers\u2014each quickly matching new features when the other rolls them out on its app.Lyft, which is by far the smaller of the two, has long tried to build a reputation as the better-behaved ride-sharing company, with a playful pink logo that stands in contrast to Uber\u2019s austere black-and-white emblem. In November, well before Uber\u2019s string of scandals started, Lyft started running a series of TV commercials portraying executives at a fictitious competitor\u2014a thinly veiled sendup of Uber\u2014scheming against Lyft and ridiculing its practice of letting riders tip drivers.That left Lyft\u2019s brand extraordinarily well-positioned when Uber\u2019s travails began in February with a blog post by a female former engineer alleging sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber. That was followed by problems including a legal battle with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo unit over autonomous-driving technology and an exodus of high-level executives, culminating in CEO and co-founder       Travis Kalanick\u2019s       resignation on Tuesday.Indeed, Lyft has benefited. Its U.S. market share has steadily increased in 2017, according to data firm Second Measure. The firm, which tracks U.S. consumers\u2019 credit card transactions, found that Lyft held 21.7% of the market in May, up from 15.9% in December. Uber\u2019s share of the market has declined about 6 percentage points in the same time period, to 78.3% from 84.1%.\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to appreciate the fact that anything that distracts Uber is a net win for Lyft,\u201d said Greylock General       Partner Simon Rothman,        who is an early individual investor in Lyft.Uber didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Lyft is trying to avoid seeming to take advantage of its rival\u2019s misfortunes. The firm has shifted from advertising that took swipes at Uber to positive messaging about Lyft itself. And its founders are counseling humility.\u201cThe faults of our competition don\u2019t do anything to deliver a better experience for our customers,\u201d Lyft co-founders       John Zimmer       and       Logan Green       wrote in the companywide email, which was sent Friday.Still, Lyft isn\u2019t letting the opportunity slip. It is aggressively recruiting new riders, people familiar with the matter say. The company also launched in 150 new cities this year, exceeding the 100 cities it said it would launch in during the year in only six months.Lyft has formed a partnership with Waymo to collaborate on self-driving cars, and struck a deal with Boston driverless-car company NuTonomy. This month it signed a deal with Land Rover to collaborate on autonomous driving technology, with the British luxury-vehicle company investing $25 million in Lyft.Lyft also raised $600 million in fresh funding this year at a valuation of $7.5 billion. And the events at Uber appear to have benefited Lyft\u2019s share price on the secondary market for private shares, said       Ken Sawyer,        managing director of Saints Capital, which buys shares from venture-capital firms.\u201cSince the beginning of this year, the ask [for Lyft] has definitely gone up,\u201d said Mr. Sawyer, whose firm doesn\u2019t own shares in Lyft or Uber. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely trading higher than it was when all this started.\u201dMorgan Housel, partner at Collaborative Fund, an early Lyft investor, said Lyft is capitalizing on the moment even if it isn\u2019t trumpeting it.Write to Cat Zakrzewski at cat.zakrzewski@wsj.com and Patience Haggin at patience.haggin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Uber Competitor: This Isn\u2019t a Time to Gloat.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 12:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyft-urges-not-time-to-gloat-amid-uber-turmoil-1498131001", "news_title": "Lyft\u2019s Goal: Gain From Uber\u2019s Stumbles Without Gloating", "keywords": "lyft,ride-hailing,uber,Uber Technologies,Lyft,NuTonomy,Travis Kalanick,Logan Green,Founders John Zimmer,Ken Sawyer,Melissa Waters,Partner Simon Rothman,marketing,markets,market share,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "More Americans approve of the Affordable Care Act than the House Republican bill to repeal and replace it, but many still want Congress to find some way to fix former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       signature health-care law, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds.Asked how they viewed the 2010 health law widely known as Obamacare, 41% of respondents said it was a good idea, and 38% said it was a bad idea, according to the poll, which was released just as Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of a health-care overhaul.The GOP health-care bill passed by the House in May was resoundingly panned in the poll: Just 16% said the House repeal-and-replace bill was a good idea. That is even less popular than the 23% approval it drew in a poll taken shortly after the bill was passed.Some 48% viewed the House GOP bill as a bad idea, including 41% who strongly believed so.Senate Republicans have been drafting their own version of legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, with plans to bring it to a vote as early as next week.Among the differences, the Senate bill would cut Medicaid more gradually than the House bill\u2014but ultimately make deeper cuts. It would change the tax credits provided to people who buy health insurance on their own, basing the size of the credits on factors like the cost of health care where the individual lives.The Obama-backed law grew more popular early this year as President       Donald Trump       and the Republican-led Congress began talks to repeal it. In January, the Journal/NBC News poll found that more people viewed the law as a good idea rather than a bad one, the first such finding since the law was passed.The share viewing the law as a good idea has slipped slightly, from 45% in January to 41% in the new survey. Some 38% think Obamacare is a bad idea, the least negative rating since the law passed.As for what should happen next, 38% said Congress and Mr. Trump should continue their efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare.Some 39% said they didn\u2019t want that effort to continue, but only 9% wanted the law to be left unchanged. Some 28% wanted the law to be fixed but not repealed, and 2% wanted it repealed but not replaced.The Journal/NBC poll was conducted June 17-20 and included 900 adults.

Had the winemaker\u2014or, more likely, wine marketer\u2014decided this disco-bright color was one that would draw buyers or did the contents require a colorful cover up? I spotted several other bottles of a similar hue\u2014a few German Rieslings and a couple Moscatos\u2014and wondered if I was seeing the start, the middle or the end of a trend. The larger question: How do bottle colors or grape varieties or even entire countries (see: New Zealand) become so popular they actually turn into trends?A few decades ago, a great ad campaign could start a trend. Take, for example, Bartles & Jaymes, the fictional folksy spokesmen created by Gallo in the early 1980s. Messrs. Bartles and Jaymes sat on a porch and told the story of how they had created a wine cooler. The highly successful television campaign not only made the B&J label a hit but also launched an entire industry of low-alcohol fruit drinks.A decade earlier, the white wine       Blue Nun       became famous largely thanks to a clever radio campaign starring the married comedy duo       Jerry Stiller       and       Anne Meara,        who bantered about life and a wine from Germany with an unlikely name. \u201cBlue Nun, the delicious white wine that\u2019s correct with any dish,\u201d said the spots\u2019 tagline. Around the same time, other white wines from Germany became popular, too\u2014including Black Tower (in a tower-shaped bottle) and Black Cat (aka       Zeller Schwarze Katz      ) in a bottle with a cat on its label\u2014though none was the equal of Blue Nun.When Blue Nun was transferred from a brown to a blue bottle in the late 1990s, the brand had long since lost its luster and the blue bottle did nothing to bring it back.       Peter Sichel,        the visionary who had made Blue Nun famous, denounced the move as a gimmick, a marketing contrivance unlikely to succeed, and it looks like he was right.The blue-bottled Bartenura Moscato (aka \u201cblue Bart\u201d), meanwhile, became a hot brand. When this kosher Moscato transitioned to a blue bottle back in 1992, the main goal was to help it keep up with the competition, according to Jay Buchsbaum, vice president of marketing and director of wine education at Royal Wine Corporation, which imports the wine. One of the company\u2019s competitors, a much smaller Kosher-wine producer, had bottled their Moscato in a blue bottle and promptly stole a chunk of Bartenura\u2019s market share. \u201cWe caved and followed suit,\u201d said Mr. Buchsbaum.It turned out to be a propitious move, particularly when rap star Drake and the blue bottle were prominently featured in the music video for DJ Khaled\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m On One\u201d in 2011. The wine was an instant hit among an entirely new group of drinkers. The company had nothing to do with the placement of the bottle, said Mr. Buchsbaum, but they were \u201cin awe\u201d of what the video did for their brand. The blue bottle phenomenon was kickstarted yet again when another rap star,       Nicki Minaj,        partnered with the Myx Fusions brand in 2013.The trend of cute animals on wine labels\u2014kangaroos, cats, zebras\u2014has come and gone and might come again. In 2006, the data information company Nielsen noted that 77 so-called \u201ccritter\u201d brands had debuted in the preceding three years, piggybacking on the great popularity of Yellow Tail, the Australian Shiraz whose label depicted a leaping wallaby. Launched in 2001, Yellow Tail was styled as an affordable, approachable, easy-drinking red and it was an immediate hit in the U.S. Other brands like the Little Penguin, Tall Horse, Smoking Loon and Goats do Roam, sought to capture the same drinkers with their cute counterparts but never succeeded to quite the extent that Yellow Tail did.By December 2006, the headline of an article in Wine & Spirits Daily read, \u201cAre Critter Labels Becoming Pass\u00e9?\u201d It was, predicted this report, the \u201cbeginning of the end.\u201d According to       Danny Brager,        SVP of beverage alcohol at Nielsen, growth had decidedly slowed by the middle of 2008. Sales of critter labels had slowed to a tiny 2% growth between mid-2007 and July 2008.A resurrection of sorts for Yellow Tail was attempted at this year\u2019s Super Bowl, with a 30-second ad featuring a man in a bright-yellow suit and a kangaroo cooking at a barbecue with the tagline \u201cIf you see a roo at a party, it\u2019s a good party.\u201d Australians reacted with outrage to what they regarded as a cheap cultural stereotype.Other trends have taken off and never really faded. The New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc category unofficially entered the American market with the brand Cloudy Bay in 1990 and has been hot ever since. Pinot Noir has been trending upward ever since the release of \u201cSideways\u201d in 2004. The movie is inevitably and unendingly credited with the Pinot Noir boom thanks to the eloquent championing of the grape by the otherwise reprehensible character       Miles Raymond       (      Paul Giamatti      ).\u2018The \u2018critter brands\u2019 trend has come and gone and might come again.\u2019Danelle Kosmal,        the Washington, D.C.-based vice president of beverage alcohol at Nielsen, cited \u201cSideways\u201d when she noted Pinot Noir\u2019s continued upward trend. I had contacted her hoping to talk about trends, including blue bottles (which, sadly, the company does not track), and to see if she had any predictions for the future. Ms. Kosmal had some interesting statistics on hand. For example, Moscato is still growing, but, as of May 2017, was up by only 3.4% over the same time last year. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the hottest trend,\u201d Ms. Kosmal said. A true trend required year-after-year double-digit growth, she said.Ms. Kosmal was kind enough to educate me as to the difference between a fad and a trend in the wine world. The former lasts under two years, according to Ms. Kosmal, while the latter takes years to unfold, and the wines tend to stay popular for a long time. \u201cIf it\u2019s sustainable it has the potential to become a trend,\u201d she said. With so much data at her disposal, could Ms. Kosmal predict what might be the next big trend?\u201cIf I could foresee the future, I\u2019d be making a lot more than I do,\u201d she replied with a laugh. But she offered a couple ideas. \u201cAlternate packaging overall is growing very strongly,\u201d she noted. \u201cThis will be an interesting season for cans.\u201d I noted that I\u2019d definitely seen more canned wine in stores. \u201cThere were some rather large launches in the spring of 2016,\u201d Ms. Kosmal added.

But there were pleasant surprises too. Foremost among them: sweet summer corn. \u201cI remember first eating it right off the cob,\u201d he said. \u201cI got sticky juice all over my face, and it was fantastic.\u201dAs a tribute, Mr. Seeger has created this corn soup, his final Slow Food Fast recipe. It calls only for fresh corn kernels, chicken stock, butter and a little heavy cream. Pur\u00e9ed until silky-smooth, the result is fresh and intensely corny. The garnish, a relish of raw corn, cilantro, jalape\u00f1o and lime, both underlines the soup\u2019s flavor and provides a textural counterpoint.The in-season, just-picked corn available in summer is so sweet because, unlike cobs shipped long distances, its sugars have not had time to convert to starch. So, to get the soup\u2019s consistency right\u2014slightly thicker than melted ice cream\u2014let the blender run an extra minute once you have a smooth pur\u00e9e, to develop the starch and add body. A glug of cold cream makes the texture even more velvety. \u201cI add it at the end so it whips and increases in volume,\u201d Mr. Seeger said.What better way to distill the pleasure of summer\u2019s freshly shucked ears? To Mr. Seeger, they remain a sweet surprise, year after year.Total Time: 20 minutes Serves: 41. Make soup: Set a medium pot over medium-high heat and add butter. Once butter has melted, after about 1 minute, stir in \u00be of the corn kernels and cook until bright yellow, 1-2 minutes. Pour in chicken stock and bring to a boil, about 3 minutes. Boil until corn has softened but still has some bite, and stock takes on corn flavor, about 2 minutes. Season with salt.2. Transfer soup to a food processor or blender and pur\u00e9e until very smooth, about 2 minutes. Then, continue blending soup until it thickens further, about 1 minute more. Pass soup through a strainer and discard solids left in strainer. Return soup to food processor or blender and process a third time. With motor running, slowly pour in cold cream. Season with salt to taste.3. Make corn relish: Place remaining corn in a medium bowl. Toss kernels with jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, olive oil, lime juice and salt to taste.4.

One is Anbang Insurance Group Co., whose chairman Wu Xiaohui has been detained by investigators of economic crimes, according to people familiar with the matter. Also on the list is HNA Group Co., one of China\u2019s most aggressive overseas investors;             Fosun International Ltd.        0656 -0.34%      , whose chairman dubs himself as China\u2019s       Warren Buffett,        and Dalian Wanda Group, a property giant that recently has branched out into entertainment.The fifth company on the list is Rossoneri Sports Investment Management Changxing Ltd., which made headlines with its acquisition this year of Italian soccer powerhouse AC Milan.The five are famed for bold international bets on big brand names, opaque structures and a dizzying amount of deal making. Excluding Rossoneri, they accounted for a whopping $57 billion in overseas investment since the beginning of 2015\u201415% of Chinese companies\u2019 total, according to Dealogic.\u201cThey\u2019re all guys that have engaged in high-profile marquee international acquisitions,\u201d from soccer clubs to Hollywood businesses, said       Bill Bowler,        an equity-sales trader at Forsyth Barr Asia in Hong Kong. The regulator\u2019s move has already sent shock waves through Chinese markets and could rock the deals world, where the groups are well known.Fosun and Anbang have both relied on insurance units to build scale and pivot overseas. While neither name is well-known outside business circles, each boasts landmark assets. Fosun owns Cirque du Soleil and Club M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e SA, while Anbang owns New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria and Essex House hotels. HNA bought 25% of the Hilton hotel group last year.The investigation started on June 6, when officials at the China Banking Regulatory Commission held what was described as \u201curgent\u201d conference calls, asking lenders to look over loans made to the five groups as well as the guarantees provided by banks to let them borrow overseas.The goal, one of the people said, is to \u201cexamine those companies\u2019 leverage situations and risks.\u201d Banks are required to report the results of their checks to the regulator, which then will assess whether lenders should cut down their exposure to the companies, the people said.Liu Zhiqing, an official at the banking regulator, declined to comment on the issue but said big companies are naturally a focus of the regulator when it comes to systemic risk, a phrase increasingly used by regulators.Share prices of several listed units of the groups plunged Thursday on word that some banks have been selling the groups\u2019 bonds.             Bank of China Ltd.      , for instance, began scaling back its holdings of Wanda-issued bonds in early June, tagging those bonds as \u201crisky,\u201d according to a person familiar with the situation.             China Construction Bank                   has grown increasingly cautious about exposure to HNA\u2019s international deals, according to a banker there.Shenzhen-listed shares of Wanda Film Co., the entertainment unit of Wanda Group, which is controlled by billionaire       Wang Jianlin,        were suspended in the early afternoon Thursday after falling nearly 10%. In a statement, the company denied that banks had dumped Wanda\u2019s bonds.Hong Kong-listed HNA Holding Group Co., a unit of HNA Group, fell 6%, while Fosun International closed down 5.8%. Anbang has no listed entities.HNA didn\u2019t have an immediate comment. Rossoneri couldn\u2019t be reached. A Fosun spokeswoman said operations are normal; she didn\u2019t elaborate. Anbang didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Wanda declined to comment on the probe.The probe into these companies\u2019 borrowing is part of a broader government campaign aimed at safeguarding China\u2019s financial system from potential systemic risk ahead of a major Communist Party reshuffle later this year.A surprise of this is regulators\u2019 questioning of high-profile private tycoons, who in many cases have ties to the party elite and hold positions on top advisory bodies. But Chinese President       Xi Jinping       has appeared less enamored than past administrations with the country\u2019s \u201cred capitalists.\u201dMr. Wu\u2019s disappearance this month was the biggest name to face investigators since the brief disappearance in 2015 of Fosun co-founder Guo Guangchang for what the company described as assistance with investigations.Anbang has described Mr. Wu\u2019s absence as temporary. Mr. Wu earned unwelcome attention for a since-withdrawn plan to help finance a Manhattan redevelopment owned by the family of       Jared Kushner,        U.S. President       Donald Trump\u2019s       son-in-law and adviser.The headline-grabbing growth of businesses such as Fosun, Wanda, HNA and Anbang have appeared out of sync as China battles soaring debt levels and other economic challenges.Of particular concern to regulators has been a surge in capital outflows, which pressured the Chinese yuan to weaken and shook confidence in the government\u2019s economic management. Since late last year, authorities have restricted the ability of Chinese companies to invest overseas and erected more hurdles for individuals to take money out. At a March forum, Pan Gongsheng, a vice governor of China\u2019s central bank, called some companies\u2019 overseas investment \u201cirrational and abnormal,\u201d chastising them for making those investments with borrowed money and only for the purpose of transferring assets offshore.Rossoneri\u2019s deal to buy AC Milan almost was derailed and was postponed by more than five months, until a U.S. hedge fund stepped in to back the \u20ac740 million ($826.6 million) deal, which made AC Milan the first fully Chinese-owned world-class soccer club.Overseas direct investment by Chinese companies dropped 56.1% in the first four months of this year from a year earlier, compared with a 44.1% surge in such deals in 2016, according to official data. Meanwhile, capital outflows have slowed in recent months, and the country\u2019s foreign-exchange reserves have risen for four months in a row, to $3.054 trillion in May.Just how indebted many of China\u2019s big conglomerates have become is extremely tough to gauge for outsiders.The equivalents of parent companies for the Anbang, HNA and Wanda groups aren\u2019t listed and disclosure is thin. None of those groups have credit ratings from the big, global rating companies.In December of last year, for example, S&P warned it could lower its credit rating on Wanda\u2019s main property unit, which had recently delisted from the Hong Kong stock exchange. S&P said that an increase in \u201cbusiness and financial integration\u201d with the overall group weakened its credit profile.HNA Group said it had around $104 billion in debt at the end of 2016. HNA has often used cash flow and assets from its units to finance other investments, a fact acknowledged by S&P in November when it lowered the ratings on some European transportation companies HNA was buying. S&P said it thought the group\u2019s financial policy was \u201caggressive\u201d and its leverage was high. A company executive said recently he believes using leverage makes HNA a smart investor in the current low interest-rate environment.Wanda\u2019s overseas buying spree has included $3.5 billion for film-production company Legendary Entertainment and $2.6 billion for             AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,       the world\u2019s largest movie-theater operator. The company\u2019s $1 billion bid for Dick Clark Productions Inc. was scrapped earlier this year due to Beijing\u2019s recent capital controls.\u2014Phred Dvorak and Julie Steinberg in Hong Kong and Chao Deng and Grace Zhu in Beijing contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   China\u2019s banking regulator has ordered the country\u2019s commercial banks to investigate loans made to a group of companies that have aggressively invested overseas in recent years. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the loans were made by the group of companies. In addition, excluding Rossoneri, Anbang, Fosun, HNA and Wanda accounted for a whopping $57 billion in overseas investment since the beginning of 2015\u201415% of Chinese companies\u2019 total, according to Dealogic. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated all five of the companies accounted for $387 billion in overseas investment since the beginning of 2015.

Seventy miles out into the Atlantic Ocean, just after 8:30 a.m., they baited hooks and let out some line as they trolled the waters moving around 5 knots.All was quiet until they got a bite at 8:48 a.m. and the yellow fishing line quickly unspooled off the reel. Mr. Heasley fought the fish for 10 minutes, his rod bending to the boat rails, before the crew gaffed and hauled it on board.It was the fish of a lifetime\u2014a 76.5-pound white marlin that won him the world\u2019s largest annual billfish tournament, the\u00a0White Marlin Open,\u00a0and $2,818,662 in prize money.He swears it happened just like that.Fishing is full of tall tales about the one that got away, and polygraph tests, more common in police interrogation rooms than on marina docks, are now used in high-stakes fishing tournaments. Mr. Heasley, like many winners, was required to take the test.Other methods include verification by a biologist and surveillance to catch cheaters who in the past have employed creative tactics, including loading\u00a0fish\u00a0with weights, switching a catch with a larger\u00a0fish\u00a0in waiting, and tail trimming to allow larger\u00a0fish\u00a0to win a small-length category. Some states, such as Texas and Alabama, have passed laws to combat fish-tournament fraud.Polygraph tests aren\u2019t perfect, but they help deter cheating, say organizers of the White Marlin Open, which draws more than 300 boats and 2,000 anglers who pay $1,000 each year to compete. Polygraph tests are required for its winners of amounts greater than $50,000.In the case of the Maryland marlin, all four men on board the\u00a0Kallianassa\u00a0were administered polygraph tests.One day after boating the multimillion-dollar fish, Mr. Heasley and his captain,       David Morris,        took turns sitting before a polygrapher in a second-floor room in an Ocean City hotel. Then came the questions:\u201cDid you commit any tournament violations\u00a0Tuesday?\u201d\u201cDid you commit any tournament violations on your vessel?\u201d\u201cDid you commit any tournament violations?\u201dMr. Heasley wiggled his toes and bounced his legs, according to court depositions. \u201cI\u2019m not a stationary person\u2014I\u2019m fidgety,\u201d he said.\u00a0His captain was nervous, hung over, and complained of claustrophobia, according to the deposition. Both answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions. Neither passed the test.\u201cFor the first time in my life, my integrity and honesty have been challenged, not because of any allegation of wrongdoing, but because of polygraph tests,\u201d Mr. Heasley said in a written statement this week. \u201cThe toll that these events have had and continue to have on my family and my crew is massive and harrowing.\u201dCapt. Morris said, also in a written statement this week: \u201cI am a fisherman, it\u2019s who I am. My word is my reputation, it follows you in this business. My crew and I are honorable fisherman, nothing will ever change that, not skewed polygraphs nor distorted and fabricated timelines. My crew and I stand by our word and our reputation.\u201d\u200bMr. Heasley\u2019s lawyer said Mr. Heasley and his crew abided by all of the tournament rules and regulations.Mr. Heasley said in a deposition he may have tripped up over questions about the tournament rules\u2014he was familiar with the four pages of regulations, but didn\u2019t have them memorized. He said he was confused about how to answer some of the questions, and thought the polygraph test was more of a formality, like signing a scorecard after a golf tournament. \u201cI was as truthful as yes and no answers will let anyone be,\u201d he said in court documents.A few weeks later, Mr. Heasley, along with two crew mates, one of whom said he was hung over after drinking 15 beers the night before, according to court documents, took another polygraph test. All three failed.According to the test results, Mr. Heasley and the two mates were deceptive about whether or not they violated any tournament rules.\u200bIn addition to the failed polygraphs, the tournament record showed signs of misconduct,\u00a0according to event organizers. The record was initially marked down with a catch time of 8:15 a.m. That time was crossed out and changed to 9:05 a.m. before Mr. Heasley submitted it to officials. Tournament rules prohibit fishing before 8:30 a.m.After his second failed polygraph test, tournament officials announced Mr. Heasley was in violation of the rules and wouldn\u2019t receive the prize money.The matter moved to federal court in Baltimore, with contest organizers asking to redistribute the $2.8 million first prize to 13 competitors who won other categories during the\u00a0tournament.After a two-week trial, the judge ruled on June 14 that Mr. Heasley and his crew failed the required test and, according to tournament rules, wouldn\u2019t receive the winnings.The judge also found Mr. Heasley and the Kallianassa crew violated the tournament\u2019s time ruling. \u201cSpecifically, it is clear from the evidence and testimony presented in this case that the Kallianassa\u2019s fishing lines were deployed and in the water before 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday, August 9, 2016.\u201dMr. Heasley\u2019s defense relied heavily on discrediting the accuracy of lie-detector tests. \u201cPolygraphs are not like a pregnancy test, where you dip in a stick and you get your answer\u2014yes or no. They\u2019re highly, highly subjective tests,\u201d       Chris Sullivan,        Mr. Heasley\u2019s attorney, said in court in December, explaining courts don\u2019t allow polygraphs as admissible evidence, and studies show them to be only 50% accurate. \u201cIt has nothing to do with catching the winning fish.\u201d\u201cThe polygraph tests worked,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0White Marlin Open founder       Jim Motsko.      \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not calling anyone a cheater. But this could have changed the playing field in every tournament. This is a professional sport. You need to enforce the rules.\u201dAnglers beware\u2014organizers of other fishing tournaments are watching carefully Mr. Motsko said. \u201cMy phone hasn\u2019t stopped ringing.\u201dCapt. Morris defended his boss as the most ethical and honest person he knows\u2014\u201cstraight as can be,\u201d he said in a deposition. When asked why he was nervous during the test, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, man.

Because no one has showed me a legitimate successor.\u201dMr. Macron\u2019s comments mark his first major foreign policy departure from his predecessor,       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande,        who has insisted since the early days of Syria\u2019s bloody civil war that Mr. Assad should step down. Mr. Macron took office last month after winning the election in a landslide.Mr. Macron added that he had found some common ground with Russian President       Vladimir Putin,        a key supporter of Mr. Assad, on the question of Syria. The two leaders met in Versailles outside Paris last month.\u201cWe\u2019ve been blocked for a long time on the figure of Bashar al-Assad,\u201d Mr. Macron said, \u201cBut Bashar, he is not our enemy. He is the enemy of the Syrian people.\u201dMr. Macron, however, drew a \u201cred line\u201d against Mr. Assad using chemical weapons, after the international community accused the Syrian regime of unleashing sarin gas in April on rebel-held areas, killing scores of people. U.S. President       Donald Trump       ordered cruise missile strikes against a Syrian military air base in retaliation. Mr. Macron said that France would conduct airstrikes if Mr. Assad used chemical weapons again, with or without French allies.\u201cIf it\u2019s found that chemical weapons are used on the ground and that we know the origin, France will then proceed to strikes to destroy stocks of chemical weapons,\u201d he said.Mr. Macron\u2019s remarks could spark debate within Europe about the bloc\u2019s diplomatic stance on the Syrian conflict. European diplomats have long called on Mr. Assad to step aside after six years of brutal civil war, in which tens of thousands of people have died at the hands of regime forces.\u201cThe EU recalls that there can be no lasting peace in Syria under the current regime,\u201d the bloc\u2019s foreign ministers said in a statement in April.France is a major contributor to the U.S.-led military coalition fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. French jets fly bombing missions out of regional air bases, while French artillery batteries and special forces are fighting the extremist group on the ground.Tensions have flared recently between Russia and the coalition. A U.S. jet fighter shot down a Syrian government plane that dropped bombs near U.S.-backed forces that are bearing down on Raqqa, Islamic State\u2019s de facto capital in northern Syria.

Pushing beyond clothing, last March he curated a show called \u201cDisobedient Bodies\u201d at the Hepworth Wakefield Museum in England that merged art, sculpture, furniture and fashion.Though his own designs don\u2019t shy from the progressive\u2014he put men in ruffled mini skirts four years ago as an early practitioner of gender-blurring style\u2014Mr. Anderson also reveres the classics. The most recent evidence: his spring 2018 collection, which surprised the fashion world with its chinos, Breton tops, wide-leg jeans and trench coats. For a designer who has specialized in breaking boundaries, creating such accessible clothing is a radical statement. \u201cI think it\u2019s fine not to be scared of normality,\u201d explained Mr. Anderson. \u201cI think maybe normality is a good thing, I think it might be the new abstract.\u201dMy dream dinner party would include guests like: Donald Trump. I think I would have the       Dalai Lama,       Kim Kardashian,        and then, if I could bring people back from the dead, Picasso and Freud. Maybe just something where it\u2019s so wrong that you might actually find something right.I never leave the house without: my wallet. I feel like if I don\u2019t have my credit cards and my driver\u2019s license I\u2019m not operational in the world. Though I\u2019ve started to go back to cash. I feel like it stops you from overspending. You can actually see what [your outlay] looks like.The place I\u2019d love to return to is: St Ives. It\u2019s in Cornwall, at the very bottom of Britain. It\u2019s so hard to get to, but it\u2019s where some of my favorite artists lived, and it has an amazing way about it because it\u2019s an artist town.The album from my childhood that I still listen to is: the Backstreet Boys\u2019 \u201cMillennium,\u201d the one that is like their biggest album. That was the first CD I got for Christmas. It\u2019s just a standard.My favorite gallery is: the Hepworth Wakefield in West Yorkshire. I loved it even before I curated the exhibition. It really has got true values and it stands for what it is. I\u2019ve also always been an advocate for the need to get out of our cities.My most cherished memory is: being with my parents and my brother and my sister going down the Ard\u00e8che in southern France in canoes, even though my brother and I weren\u2019t very good at it. We were very young. My parents were very active. They liked a dangerous sport for the kids.The person I\u2019d like to design for is: Al Pacino. Just because he probably doesn\u2019t engage with fashion at all.The oldest piece of clothing in my closet is: our tour T-shirt from when I was in the National Music Theater. I still wear it to garden.I love to collect: ceramics, ceramics, ceramics. I recently got quite an important vase from Bernard Leach with four fish on it from the first series of those vases.My favorite under-the-radar brand is: Purdey in London. It\u2019s an old gun company. They just do amazing sweaters and it\u2019s very quintessential. They\u2019re still going.Men rarely look good when they wear: new boots, especially when they tuck their jeans into them. It\u2019s all too tight. They look frigid.The book I love to read again and again is: \u201cLess Than Zero\u201d by Bret Easton Ellis. I initially read it when I went to Washington, D.C., about 10 years ago. It was one of the first books I fell in love with.The one thing I wish I\u2019d invented is: jeans. Yves Saint Laurent once said that. But the more I\u2019ve done fashion, I\u2019ve realized it would be either jeans or the white T-shirt.My favorite cuisine is: Indian. I can\u2019t cook. Well sort of. I can make a great salad.My day isn\u2019t complete until: I get my email inbox to zero. It\u2019s important to start the day fresh.The most-used app on my phone is: Instagram. I enjoy posting because it\u2019s a relief to put things out there yourself. You have more control over them.The most stylish fictional character is: The Pink Panther. The original.I unwind at the end of the day by: eating takeout, drinking a beer and watching TV. My favorite show right now is called \u201cVersailles\u201d [available on Amazon] about the court of Louis XIV. It\u2019s got a lot of sex, a lot of power, a lot of control.My pen of choice is: a black Sharpie. I don't really use them to draw. I use them when I\u2019m angry and have to write things down.If money were no object, I would buy: a Rubens painting.

The attempted attack caused no other casualties.The prosecutors said the four people were taken in \u201cfor thorough questioning\u201d after four different houses were searched. Two of the houses were located in the Brussels district of Koekelberg, one in Anderlecht and another in Molenbeek, the neighborhood where the alleged attacker lived.Authorities released the four people without charges on Thursday afternoon, prosecutors said.The attempted attack, by a suspect without previously known ties to extremist groups but who was believed to have had sympathy for Islamic State, had echoes of other recent terrorist attacks in Europe.Islamic State has emphasized for the past year and a half that jihadists in Europe shouldn\u2019t travel to the Middle East to fight, but instead remain at home and carry out attacks, U.S. and European officials said.No one was hurt in the initial blast, but the suitcase caught fire. The man then fled, leaving the suitcase, and ran downstairs, prosecutors said.The abandoned bag exploded in what prosecutors described as a second, more violent blast.

LOUIS\u2014Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said he doesn\u2019t see any need for further interest-rate increases but the central bank should begin shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio of assets \u201csooner rather than later.\u201dMr. Bullard isn\u2019t a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which last week raised the Fed\u2019s benchmark short-term rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 1% and 1.25%. The increase was the third such move since mid-December, and projections released after the Fed\u2019s policy meeting showed officials have penciled in one more quarter-point rate increase this year and three in each of the coming two years.Last week\u2019s rate increase is \u201cnot such a big problem,\u201d Mr. Bullard said in an interview\u00a0Wednesday. But the projection to raise the federal-funds rate to 3% over the next 2\u00bd years \u201cis unnecessarily aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trajectory that the committee has laid out seems to me to be inappropriate given the situation that we\u2019re in.\u201dMr. Bullard for the last year has said the slow-growing U.S. economy offers little urgency for additional rate increases and that the central bank has essentially met its goals to boost hiring and hold inflation steady. Fed officials meet again\u00a0July 25-26.Markets have questioned the Fed\u2019s rate plans because of a recent slowdown in inflation, keeping it below the central bank\u2019s 2% target since touching it briefly earlier this year.Mr. Bullard said the softening in inflation appeared to be more widespread than initial reports, which showed large price declines from a handful of items, such as wireless phone plans and prescription drugs.\u201cI\u2019m open to the idea that maybe there was just some noise in there\u2014that\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it looks more broad-based to me, and now with other corroborating factors like the 10-year [Treasury yield] coming down to low levels, oil prices falling, it just doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s a lot of price pressure.\u201dSeparate SubscriptionChicago Fed President       Charles Evans       said in an interview Tuesday he would prefer to hold off on raising rates until the end of the year to make sure the Fed wasn\u2019t falling further behind on its inflation goal. \u201cI sometimes wonder if there isn\u2019t something more global, more technological that\u2019s taking place that we don\u2019t quite have our arms around very well,\u201d said Mr. Evans, who is an FOMC voter this year.Minneapolis Fed chief       Neel Kashkari       explained his vote opposing the rate rise last week by saying it was a mistake to boost the cost of borrowing with inflation so short of the target. Dallas Fed President       Robert Kaplan,        also an FOMC voter this year, said last week he wanted to see improvement in inflation before supporting another rate increase.Still, officials such as Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       and New York Fed President       William Dudley       seem confident inflation setbacks should be temporary because the unemployment rate, at 4.3%, is historically low.Mr. Bullard for months has advocated steps to reduce the size of the central bank\u2019s $4.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and other holdings, which the Fed amassed during and after the financial crisis to stimulate the economy by holding down long-term rates. Officials last week released a new plan detailing how they will reduce those holdings, also known as the balance sheet. Allowing the balance sheet to decline could cause long-term rates to rise.The Fed stopped adding to its balance sheet in late 2014, but the central bank has been reinvesting the proceeds of maturing assets to keep the holdings steady. Under the plan, the Fed would set guardrails to allow a preset amount of holdings to mature every month without reinvestment. The guardrails would initially be set at a relatively low level\u2014$10 billion a month\u2014and they would increase every quarter by $10 billion up to a maximum of $50 billion.The Fed hasn\u2019t said when it will initiate the plan, which officials have said they hope to have run quietly in the background once it starts.\u201cWe\u2019ve outlined an approach that is going to be very much a go-slow approach, and so I think we could start the ball rolling.

His other works include the Museum of the African Diaspora in San Francisco, Emancipation Park in Houston and his current project, a $50 million expansion of the Motown Museum in Detroit.The couple bought the 2,100-square-foot, two-story space\u2014a vacant shell that in another era stored mechanical equipment in the 1930s building\u2014for $175,500 in 2010, records show. The 14-unit mixed-use condo development still has the original Kress logo and ornate terra-cotta facade. He bought the space from a developer who had intended to keep the unit, but was deterred by the awkward layout\u2014the two floors are offset, not directly aligned on top of each other.\u201cWe like challenges,\u201d said Mr. Freelon, 64, for whom the project marked a departure from his large-scale, modernist work. \u201cIf it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s boring.\u201dHe collaborated on the design with Durham architect Ellen Cassilly. The Freelons spent around $450,000 and nine months to complete the one-bedroom, loft-like apartment, which has a roughly 216-square-foot rooftop terrace overlooking the skyline.Design obstacles became an advantage. The large commercial windows were unusually high off the floor, so Mr. Freelon raised the floor 18 inches, allowing him to hide ductwork and air systems below the floor and bring the windows to eye level. A structural beam in the center of the floorplan was used to create distinct quadrants on the main level: kitchen, dining, living and music, where Mrs. Freelon, 60, plays her baby grand piano.\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely space to create music,\u201d said Mrs. Freelon.The foyer leads to an open floorplan with red-oak flooring, 9-foot concrete ceilings, and track lighting to showcase the family\u2019s collection of mostly African-American art. One of Mr. Freelon\u2019s favorites, an impressionist harbor scene from Gloucester, Mass., was painted by his grandfather, Allan Freelon Sr., a noted Harlem Renaissance artist. For \u201ca little bit of funkiness,\u201d Mr. Freelon said they built a curved pumpkin-orange wall that outlines the kitchen and adds color.A central staircase is lighted by a large clerestory window that brightens both levels. Alcoves in the walls of the stairwell display traditional sculptures from West Africa.Upstairs, the only bedroom, a spacious suite with 11-foot ceilings, opens onto the rooftop deck, with sturdy blue-oat-grass planters that can withstand Durham\u2019s dry heat. A television is hidden in the adjacent study, where Mrs. Freelon creates collage and multimedia art. (Rather than watch TV in the bedroom, they stream music by the likes of Ella Fitzgerald or Pat Metheny on their built-in sound system.)The couple, who have been married for 37 years and have three adult children, used to live in a 6,000-square-foot Georgian Colonial nearby. They are now wrapping up a modernist lake house about 20 minutes from town, where they plan to split their time.Their plans were complicated last year when Mr. Freelon was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a disease that affects muscle control and mobility. \u201cIt\u2019s relevant to everything I do now,\u201d said Mr. Freelon, who launched the Freelon Fund to support research on the disease.The couple\u2019s two-story penthouse can be retrofitted with a glass elevator, he said, and their lake house was designed with mobility and ease of access in mind from the start.He finds some poignancy in how his work remains the same. \u201cI\u2019ve always been focused on accessibility and providing equal access to everyone,\u201d he said.Write to Stefanos Chen at stefanos.chen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 11:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-architects-penthouse-in-an-unlikely-place-1498143733", "news_title": "An Architect\u2019s Penthouse in an Unlikely Place", "keywords": " architect , commercial conversion, durham nc, home renovation,luxury homes,luxury real estate,nnenna freelon, penthouse, perkins and will,phil freelon,Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture,Museum of the African Diaspora,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,real estate,property,technical services,architects,surveyors,business,consumer services,construction"}, {"content": "Over the past year, a number of Wall Street firms have introduced robotic advisory services that allow investors to engage in automatic socially responsible investing. Services with names like EarthFolio, Prophecy Impact and Wealthsimple rely in part on computer picks so that their investors, many of them millennials, can effortlessly buy stocks in companies working hard to make the world a better place. Companies that make solar panels, run windmills, treat their employees fairly. Good companies. Nice companies. Companies you could take home to meet mommy.Yet at the same time, I hear that a growing number of investment companies are now devising socially irresponsible bot platforms that make it easier for insensitive, ethically elastic or just plain depraved investors to buy stocks in companies that work night and day to make the planet less green, less safe, less pleasant.\u201cThere\u2019s a common perception that millennials are soft and sensitive and caring and green,\u201d says Taters Shank, president and founder of VileBot, an automatic investment advisory service targeting young people who only care about making oodles of money and don\u2019t care how they do it. \u201cBut my nephew Skippy is scum. His sister Teal isn\u2019t much better. Most of the millennials we have working down in marketing could give Lucifer himself a run for his money. And those kids have loads of disposable income.\u201dIn many ways, evil-minded robotic advisory services have an easier job of it. Socially responsible investment services sometimes ask customers to tell them what industries they want to avoid\u2014say, alcohol, tobacco, firearms, anything connected with country music.No need to do that with, for example, the bot investor DeadRed. \u201cDeadRed only invests in companies run by crooked ex-communists over in Russia and Eastern Europe,\u201d says Vlad Vronsky, who acts as a middleman between wicked companies and perfidious investors. \u201cEarth in Imbalance automatically buys shares in companies that guarantee to make the world a less safe place. Last year, both firms returned 35%, fees included. Who\u2019s gonna turn up their nose at returns like that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible to do well by doing good,\u201d says Cruella de Villanova, author of \u201cRevert to the Mean,\u201d a best-selling guide to investing in profoundly immoral exchange-traded funds. \u201cBut you won\u2019t do great.

A bot has no moral fulcrum. A bot has no ethical quibbles.

The richly valued private company has had\u2014to put it mildly\u2014a miserable year of self-inflicted wounds. The departure of founder and Chief Executive       Travis Kalanick       under pressure from several large investors on Wednesday caps a monthslong investigation into the ride-sharing company\u2019s toxic culture. Several other top executives have departed recently as well.But despite a monthslong flow of embarrassing headlines, Uber remains comfortably on top of the market that it created\u2014despite challenges from competitors such as Lyft. While Uber doesn\u2019t publicly disclose its full financial results, it reported earlier this month that first-quarter revenue was $3.4 billion\u2014an 18% gain from the fourth quarter. Lyft, its next closest rival, was reported to have made $700 million in revenue for all of last year. And even though many ride-sharing drivers in the U.S. now drive for multiple companies, Uber still has more than twice as many drivers as Lyft, estimates       Harry Campbell,        who runs a popular industry blog called The RideShare Guy, which frequently surveys ride-sharing drivers.That sort of scale isn\u2019t easy to dislodge. Most riders at the end of the day will go with the service that picks them up soonest. And despite Uber\u2019s damaged brand, the company is still far better known than its rivals. A survey conducted last year by SharesPost, which studies privately held companies, found that 74% of U.S. consumers cited unaided awareness of Uber as a ride-sharing service compared with 29% for Lyft.That doesn\u2019t mean Uber\u2019s scandals don\u2019t come with a cost. TXN Solutions, which surveys credit-card receipts, estimates that Uber\u2019s share of U.S. ride-share transactions slipped to 75% by mid-June from 79% in mid-February\u2014before a blog post from a female ex-employee ignited the current firestorm. And Uber still loses money, likely in part because of subsidies it pays drivers in newer markets to keep prices low and gain share. A tarnished brand image that drives more riders to competitors exacerbates that problem.Still, it is telling that even a heavily damaged Uber managed accounts for three-quarters of the U.S. ride-share market. That scale should buy the company time to make the many repairs it needs before going public\u2014the biggest of which was getting rid of Mr. Kalanick and the culture he created. There will be a push for more changes from the investors that have ballooned its private valuation to $68 billion.

In the past year, however, demand has been strengthened by buyers priced out of Vancouver and other Canadian cities, and by semi-retired professionals able to work remotely and who are seeking a laid-back lifestyle.The median price of a Victoria home rose 15.5% to 587,086 Canadian dollars, or $436,008, in the first quarter of 2017 compared with the same period last year, according to real-estate brokerage Royal LePage. Inventory has plummeted. And Victoria\u2019s luxury market, which starts around $1.5 million, is booming. Between May 2016 and May 2017, 126 homes sold at or above that price; before 2015 these sales hovered between 20 and 40, said Fair Realty\u2019s Leo Spalteholz, who writes a blog about the Victoria market.\u201cIn single-family homes, where we have our biggest crunch, there\u2019s just no land to build anymore,\u201d said Bill Ethier of Royal LePage Coast Capital Realty.Lloyd and Suzie Anderson\u2019s hunt to find a waterfront equestrian property in Victoria took almost two years. After being outbid four times, Mrs. Anderson had taken to searching real-estate websites late at night. During one search, she spotted a listing that had gone up 15 minutes earlier. \u201cWe flew out the next day\u201d from Ontario, said the 53-year-old retired teacher.The couple\u2019s roughly $2 million offer was accepted, and in August 2015 they moved into the 6,144-square-foot, four-bedroom home. Down a steep, heated driveway, the house sits amid stands of cedars and bushy rhododendrons on the Satellite Channel. A backyard path zigzags down to the water, where the couple stores their kayaks out of reach of otters. A gym offers Mr. Anderson, 56, who partly retired from his Montreal-based aircraft-equipment repair company, the space to practice jujitsu.One downside: There is no land for Mrs. Anderson\u2019s horse. So after a nearly $300,000 renovation, completed in May 2016, the couple is in contract to buy a home nearby with acreage for the horse for about $2.15 million. Their current home is listed with Deedrie Ballard of Re/Max Camosun for about $2.38 million.In recent years, Canadian home prices have spiked thanks to low interest rates, a stable economy and overseas investment. Governments in British Columbia and Ontario have implemented a 15% foreign-buyer tax to cool the markets in Vancouver and Toronto.Victoria, a collection of 13 municipalities with a total population of 367,770, lagged behind. A concentration of modestly paid government workers kept housing prices stable, and its small-town vibe and island location kept it off the radar of international buyers.All this has turned Victoria into a comparative bargain. Vancouver\u2019s median home price was about double Victoria\u2019s, or roughly $876,000, in the first quarter, according to Royal LePage.Victoria makes up a small, urban section of Vancouver Island, a 12,355-square-mile expanse of old-growth forest, mountain ranges, remote communities and vacation spots. Biking, hiking and other outdoor activities are popular pastimes. Deer are a common sight.Residents extol their city\u2019s friendliness, contrasting its easygoing attitude with the hustle and bustle of Vancouver.Victoria lacks some big-city amenities like high-end shopping and thriving nightlife. And the city is reachable only by air or boat. The Victoria International Airport has no direct flights to Europe, Asia or the eastern U.S.The boom in Victoria real estate is visible in the glassy mansions sprouting in the coveted municipality of Oak Bay, which contains the Uplands, the city\u2019s most desirable neighborhood. On a recent drive, Jason Binab of Engel & V\u00f6lkers Vancouver Island pointed out for-sale signs on stucco and shingle-style homes\u2014likely teardowns.Some Oak Bay residents have resisted proposals to build taller condo buildings, preferring single-family homes in a traditional style.\u201cChange is slow in this particular neighborhood,\u201d said Mike Miller, president of Abstract Developments. The company is behind the first condo project approved\u2014after a seven-hour public hearing and three-hour debate\u2014in Oak Bay since 2003. Construction is set to start in the fall on the Bowker Collection, 43 single-level townhouses and apartments with prices starting at about $440,000.Most of Victoria\u2019s luxury condos are located downtown near the Inner Harbour. One of the largest projects under way is Bayview Place, a nearly $750 million mixed-use development that will ultimately have 2,000 apartments spread over 20 acres, said Kenneth W. Mariash Sr., founder of master developer Focus Equities.Victoria native Rob McAdams spent about $2.23 million building his five-bedroom house in 1993 and has since invested about $375,000 in upgrades. The house sits on 16.22 acres with 840 feet of frontage on Saanich Inlet. A totem pole stands in the great room.Now semi-retired from land development, Mr. McAdams, 75, has listed the home for about $5.87 million with Royal LePage. He and his wife, Bette, 72, split their time between Victoria and Palm Desert, Calif., and the property is too large for them, he said.", "news_time": "2017-06-22 10:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-sleepy-victoria-canada-a-housing-market-wakes-up-1498141791", "news_title": "In Sleepy Victoria, Canada, a Housing Market Wakes Up", "keywords": "bayview place, bowker collection, housing market, luxury homes, luxury real estate, oak bay, uplands,victoria bc,victoria home prices,economic performance,indicators,home sales,housing affordability,economic news,housing prices,real estate markets,political,general news,real estate,property,building construction,residential building construction,construction"}, {"content": "Saudi Arabia is searching for ways to shake crude-oil prices out of a slump that threatens its new crown prince\u2019s economic-transformation plan, Persian Gulf oil officials say, but the kingdom has few good options.Mohammed bin Salman,        elevated to crown prince of Saudi Arabia this week, needs oil prices to rise from current levels of $45 a barrel to carry out plans to kick-start the kingdom\u2019s economy, largely through a partial public listing of its state oil company, known as Saudi Aramco. The Saudis are targeting $60 a barrel to help the initial public offering generate tens of billions of dollars, which would be plowed into developing new technology and industrial sectors in Saudi Arabia.Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have held informal talks in recent days about how to halt a nearly monthlong skid in oil prices, which have fallen more than 16% since late May.\u00a0OPEC, along with big producers like Russia that aren\u2019t members of the 14-nation cartel, is already withholding almost 2% of the world\u2019s oil supply, but some OPEC members say more needs to be done to bring production in line with demand.Prince Mohammed is known for taking aggressive action on several fronts, prosecuting a war in Yemen, leading the diplomatic freeze against Qatar, and greenlighting Saudi participation in OPEC\u2019s production cuts.But the Saudis have less leverage over other OPEC members because of the Aramco IPO, said       Jim Krane,        a fellow who studies Middle East energy and geopolitical issues at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute. Other OPEC members are unlikely to slash production further unless they see Saudi Arabia taking on a large share of the burden, because any new cuts would be seen as a push to support the Aramco IPO.\u201cIt\u2019s almost kind of put them on the back foot,\u201d Mr. Krane said of the Saudi oil strategy.It is a particularly difficult time for Saudi Arabia to attempt a bigger production cut. The kingdom still burns crude oil to produce electricity and it needs even more crude in the summer, when air conditioning use soars.And some OPEC delegates say bold action could be counterproductive.U.S. oil producers took advantage of a price spike late last year after OPEC announced its cuts, and ramped up production. The resulting flood of new crude oil has convinced some investors that OPEC\u2019s actions aren\u2019t enough to rebalance the market.\u201cThere are doubts if this whole cut initiative was effective,\u201d said an OPEC national delegate close to the Saudis.Another OPEC delegate said Prince Mohammed was likely to be less involved in Saudi oil policy now that he has expanded responsibilities as crown prince, acting as the country\u2019s day-to-day leader. As deputy crown prince, he was often involved in the kingdom\u2019s oil strategy, especially before he appointed his own choice,       Khalid al-Falih,        in 2016 to replace veteran Saudi oil minister      Ali al-Naimi.\u201cIt is a totally different approach from that seen during the last days of Naimi,\u201d the delegate said.Saudi Arabia has time to wait for oil prices to rise, with the IPO not scheduled until 2018. Publicly, Saudi Arabia, its allies and OPEC are preaching patience.On Thursday, OPEC issued a news release touting its members compliance with their pledges to cut production. \u201cThe oil market is moving in the right direction,\u201d the news release said.Mr. Falih told an Arabic newspaper in London that Libyan and Nigerian production wouldn\u2019t stop OPEC\u2019s efforts to drain down the global oil oversupply by the end of 2017. The United Arab Emirates\u2019 oil minister,       Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei,        said OPEC wasn\u2019t planning any new action soon.Privately, OPEC members\u2019 worries are centered on two members who were exempted from the obligation to cut output: Libya and Nigeria. Both had their oil industries disrupted by civil strife, but their production has come roaring back in recent months.OPEC members say no consensus has emerged about Nigeria and Libya, which would both likely object to limits.\u201cCurbing production has always been a difficult task in OPEC,\u201d       Bijan Zanganeh,        Iran\u2019s veteran oil minister, told state media this week, confirming the OPEC talks.In lieu of new cuts, Saudi Arabia has pursued other courses to help prices. Mr. Falih has highlighted the kingdom\u2019s reduced exports to the U.S., where the summer driving season usually sends demand higher. The kingdom has also cut exports to Asia.Write to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Michael Amon at michael.amon@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Saudis Are Boxed In by Cheap Oil.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 10:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-boxed-in-by-low-oil-prices-1498141357", "news_title": "Saudis Boxed In by Low Oil Prices ", "keywords": " aramco, crown prince, mohammed bin salman, opec, prine mohammed, saudi,saudi arabia, saudi aramco, saudi prince,Saudi Aramco,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,Mohammed bin Salman,corporate changes,plans,strategy,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "SEOUL\u2014            Samsung Electronics Co.             is in late-stage discussions to invest about $300 million to expand its U.S. production facilities at a factory soon to be vacated by         Caterpillar Inc.,       according to people familiar with the matter, with an announcement expected as early as next week.The facility eyed by Samsung is in Newberry, S.C., a town located about 150 miles northwest of the port of Charleston, the people said, with plans to shift over some production of oven ranges made currently in Mexico. The investment could generate around 500 jobs, and though the start date is unclear, production would likely begin next year, the people said.Samsung could eventually ramp up U.S. manufacturing of refrigerators, washers, dryers and other home appliances in subsequent years, the people said. Final details over incentives and other matters are still being hammered out between Samsung and South Carolina officials, the people said. Though unlikely, it is still possible for either party to walk away from the pact, the people said.The timing of the announcement could still change, the people said. But South Korea\u2019s newly-elected President Moon Jae-in is scheduled to meet U.S. President Donald Trump for the first time next week in Washington.A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment.Samsung\u2019s interest in a U.S. factory was influenced by the election of Mr. Trump, who vowed on the campaign trail to bring more manufacturing jobs back into the country, The Wall Street Journal reported in March.Mr. Trump\u2019s reshoring mantra brought promises from Asian billionaires such as SoftBank Group\u2019s       Masayoshi Son       and         Foxconn Technology\u2019s      Terry Gou.       Foxconn, the assembler of iPhones and other electronics, said Thursday it was considering seven states in the American heartland to invest $10 billion or more in factories.Samsung\u2019s crosstown rival         LG Electronics Inc.       said in February it planned to build a new factory for washing machines in Tennessee, its first major U.S. plant.Samsung had previously said that it started reviewing U.S. options in the early fall last year, meaning before Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November. At least five states were under consideration at the time, the Journal reported.In recent weeks, state officials from South Carolina and Alabama traveled to South Korea to pitch their sites and incentive packages to Samsung, with the Newberry facility emerging as the leader, the people said. The two states had courted Samsung officials for months, including in high-level discussions at a Republican Governors Association event this spring, two of the people said.The South Korean electronics giant, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of smartphones, memory chips and televisions, had initially looked at a site near Blythewood, S.C., but another company landed the facility, two of the people said.Samsung had told state officials that it preferred moving into a pre-existing facility, rather than building a new factory, according to people familiar with discussions.A team of Samsung officials visited the Newberry site, which is located near Interstate 26, a freeway that feeds directly into the port of Charleston, according to two people familiar with the matter.Caterpillar said last year that it would close the Newberry facility, a packaging plant for electric generators, with 325 jobs, and eventually shift those positions to other U.S. locations.Samsung has invested heavily in the U.S. over the years, making it one of the country\u2019s largest direct foreign investors. In November, just days before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Samsung said it would invest more than $1 billion in its Austin, Texas semiconductor factory to boost production of processor chips for smartphones and other devices.Samsung\u2019s consumer-electronics unit represented nearly one-fourth of the company\u2019s annual revenue last year of 201.9 trillion South Korean won ($176.8 billion). But the unit, which makes refrigerators, ovens, televisions and other home appliances, brings in less than 10% of overall operating profit.In April, Samsung notched its highest quarterly profit in more than three years, powered by strong sales of components like memory chips and display panels.Write to Timothy W.

The seismic waves will ripple afar.China\u2019s banking regulator has asked the country\u2019s lenders to investigate loans extended to a group of companies that have aggressively invested overseas, according to The Wall Street Journal. The firms in question include Anbang Insurance, HNA Group,             Fosun International        0656 -0.34%       and Wanda Group, which together have spent tens of billions in recent years to snap up assets around the globe.Companies directly related have already felt the pain. A cinema unit of Wanda, which also owns             AMC Entertainment,        AMC -1.24%       fell 10% Thursday. Shares of Hong Kong-listed Fosun International, owner of Club M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e and Cirque du Soleil, were down about 6%.The news came a week after the chairman of Anbang was detained by a special investigative unit looking at economic crimes. Anbang has risen from obscurity to become an insurer with assets approaching $300 billion, including New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria hotel. It has grown so big partly by issuing short-dated high-yielding financial products to raise money.All of these companies have loaded up debt, sometimes using obscure financing to fund overseas ambitions. Beijing is legitimately worried about their increasing risks and intricate web with the banks. A clampdown could send shockwaves through China\u2019s financial system.The impact would be felt outside China, too. Deals that are yet to be completed now have an added level of uncertainty. Singapore logistics firm             CWT Ltd.      , pending a $1 billion takeover from HNA, fell 5.3% Thursday to a level not seen since the deal announcement. HNA is still in the process of buying a 25% stake in             Old Mutual\u2019s       U.S. asset-management unit and a majority stake in Trump-backer       Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s       hedge fund SkyBridge.Another worry is if these companies need to sell some of their assets if Beijing really turns the taps off. HNA is             Deutsche Bank\u2019s       largest shareholder with a nearly 10% stake. It also owns around a quarter of             Hilton Worldwide Holdings.       Both deals were accomplished with highly engineered financial structures, the kind that may make regulators antsy.More broadly, the \u201cChina bid,\u201d which has kept global deal making humming, will take an even longer breather than previously thought. Companies in the U.S. and Europe looking to sell themselves may now have a harder time finding a good price if these acquisitive companies are withdrawing themselves from their buying spree.China\u2019s financial plumbing problems could flush assets down the drain.Write to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 10:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goodbye-for-now-to-chinas-biggest-deal-makers-1498140875", "news_title": "Goodbye for Now to China\u2019s Biggest Deal Makers", "keywords": "AMC Entertainment,AMC,Anbang Insurance,Club M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e,Wanda Group,Fosun International,0656.HK,HK:0656,HNA Group,commodity,financial market news,hotels,restaurants,lodgings,insurance,diversified holding companies,film,video exhibition,business,consumer services,financial services,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "The first time Angelo Smyrnios pulled up in front of a Mediterranean-style home with a red-tiled roof and palm trees in Lighthouse Point, Fla., he got out of the car and said, \u201cOK, let\u2019s go see the $1.65 million house I just bought sight unseen.\u201dIt takes a confident buyer\u2014and a trusted real-estate agent\u2014to purchase property without a first-hand visit. Would-be buyers can always peruse listing photos and videos online, and Google Earth offers views of the neighborhood. But to avert some of the surprises of a long-distance listing, agents are increasingly walking clients through properties via FaceTime, Skype or WhatsApp, or even making custom videos. Real-estate brokerages and a crop of new technology companies are creating three-dimensional photographic and video tours, which can be viewed in virtual reality.Mr. Smyrnios and his wife, Lisette, began searching for a home in Lighthouse Point at the beginning of the year, after deciding to relocate from Littleton, Colo., to be closer to Ms. Smyrnios\u2019 mother. They visited the area three times, viewing property with their agents, Lisa and John Wilson of Douglas Elliman Boca Raton. In April, the Smyrnioses were busy packing up their home\u2014and Ms. Smyrnios was about to leave for a business trip\u2014when Ms. Wilson called to tell them about a house she thought was ideal for them.The Wilsons gave the couple a 45-minute tour of the property using Apple\u2019s video-calling service FaceTime. They held up an iPhone and narrated as the Smyrnioses directed them to parts of the house they wanted to examine further. Ms. Wilson also rode on the back of a motorbike, with Mr. Wilson driving, and FaceTimed the neighborhood for Ms. Smyrnios. The Smyrnioses researched crime statistics and other quality-of-life issues on Areavibes.com. Ms. Smyrnios\u2019s mother also came to look at the house\u2014a visit the couple also observed via FaceTime\u2014and gave her thumbs-up.When they first arrived, \u201cI liked it even more in person,\u201d said Ms. Smyrnios, a 49-year old executive for a consulting firm.Last summer, Laurie McNally signed a contract to buy a weekend house close to the beach in East Hampton, N.Y., paying $870,000. Not only had Ms. McNally not seen the house, but when her real-estate agents, Chris Chapin and Raymond Lord of Douglas Elliman, called to tell her about it, she was at a mind-and-body health retreat in San Diego and lacked access to a computer. Phone use was limited to a few hours each night.\u201cThey sent a couple of pictures and a description,\u201d which she looked at on her cellphone, said Ms. McNally, a finance executive who lives in Ardmore, Pa. Advised she needed to move quickly, \u201cI went on trust,\u201d Ms. McNally said.She put down a 10% deposit, customary in New York state real-estate transactions when she signed the contract. Had she decided she didn\u2019t like the property upon seeing it, \u201cshe could not have backed out without losing her deposit,\u201d said Mr. Lord.\u201cSight unseen\u201d offers on family homes are on the rise, according to Redfin, a national real-estate brokerage. In a survey of 1,334 recent home buyers in 11 major metropolitan markets, 33% said they had made an offer on at least one house \u201csight unseen.\u201d In previous surveys, Redfin found that about 20% of buyers said they had bid on houses they had never seen.Agents say blind bids are more common in hot markets where homes sell quickly, as well as in places that are popular with overseas buyers.Sotheby\u2019s International Realty adopted 3-D photography in September, and now about 10% of its listings include 3-D photo tours. About 5% of the company\u2019s 880 offices world-wide currently have virtual-reality viewing areas, where clients can view 3-D property pictures on a screen or while wearing VR headsets. In five years, the company should have such viewing areas in every office, said John Passerini, global vice president of interactive marketing for Sotheby\u2019s.VirtualAPT, a Brooklyn-based technology company that launched last year, invented a robot that films virtual tours in 3-D. The robot records a real-estate agent guiding a tour of a property, as though showing it to a live person, and produces a video within 15 minutes, said chief executive Bryan Colin.Both Mr. Passerini and Mr. Colin said the goal of such tours is to facilitate sales of real estate to people who cannot travel to see properties and to minimize time spent on a search.Today, 3-D tours are more commonly seen on high-end listings that have larger marketing budgets; Mr. Colin\u2019s tours cost $1 per square foot, so a 3,000-square-foot home would cost the real-estate agent $3,000. Although viewing 3-D tours while wearing a virtual reality headset best imitates the live experience, consumers resist putting on VR headsets, even when they are provided free, real-estate executives say. Any extra technical steps are turnoffs to consumers. VirtualAPT tours require just clicking on a link, because Mr. Colin said wealthy real-estate buyers dislike downloading apps.While Matthew Knouff was vacationing in Italy, his real-estate agent called to tell him about an apartment in Brooklyn\u2019s Williamsburg neighborhood that met all his criteria: It was a one-bedroom with a view, in a building with a pool and a screening room. While soaking in a pool on the Amalfi Coast, Mr. Knouff, a 37-year-old data-privacy consultant, toured the property on FaceTime with his agent, Dex Lipovic of CORE.Upon hanging up, Mr. Lipovic shot video with his iPhone and a DJI Osmo attachment, a video stabilizer that keeps the phone steady for a better-quality video. Mr. Knouff went into contract for $1.125 million without ever having visited the apartment.Last year, while Mr. Knouff was in London for work, Mr. Lipovic provided a FaceTime tour of a house in Bronxville, a community just north of Manhattan. Mr. Knouff bought the property for $1.175 million and is currently renovating it as he decides whether to move in or resell.Mr. Knouff thinks there\u2019s a benefit to remaining a step removed, explaining that on a brief visit to a property, a bad mood, an anomalous smell or noise or some other unimportant detail could make him dismiss a property with potential. \u201cMy bias could impact me in a negative way,\u201d said Mr. Knouff.

Whisper softly that it\u2019s going to be OK\u2014even if you know it might not be OK. The Knicks may never be OK.Negativity isn\u2019t what Knicks fans need to hear right now. Negativity, they live with, every day.Today, they need love. And hugs.There\u2019s panic in the streets of this city, as the NBA Draft approaches Thursday night, and the local basketball club has once again taken this town\u2019s loyal heart and punted it down 7th Avenue.The Knicks are said to be exploring options to trade its best young player in a generation, the Latvian big man Kristaps Porzingis.For a team that holds several copyrights on inexplicable decisions, moving Porzingis would probably be the most baffling stunt in team history. Over the past two seasons, Porzingis has been New York\u2019s skinny, 7-foot-3 beacon of hope\u2014the only intriguing part of a poorly-assembled, underperforming club.Now the Knicks are said to be open to dealing him. On Wednesday night,             Yahoo\u2019s       Cronkite of NBA wheeling-dealing, Adrian Wojnarowski, said the team has \u201cmade calls\u201d concerning moves in which Porzingis could be dealt for a package that would include a \u201cTop-4\u201d draft pick. The team is said to be excited over Kansas phenom Josh Jackson.In the annals of disastrous Knicks trades, this could be the piece de resistance. Porzingis is only 21, and has shown flashes of brilliance both offensively and defensively, and is well-suited to the NBA\u2019s current inside-outside 3-point-shooting style of play. He\u2019s also shown a preternatural gift for being able to disarm both the media and a demanding city, and has basically been delightful.But Porzingis skipped an end-of-season exit meeting with team officials, reportedly frustrated with the club\u2019s direction, and it\u2019s created a chill between the Knicks and their young star.The Knicks, of course, are a cathedral of bad feelings, a vibe largely attributed to team owner       James Dolan,        whose behind-the-scenes maneuvering has provoked a variety of strange and unceremonious exits. But Porzingisgate appears to be the doing of team president Phil Jackson, a man who entered the organization with the reputation of a Zen master and fixer\u2014and instead has caused more daily anxiety than the city\u2019s misbegotten subway system.Jackson confirmed his chagrin over Porzingis\u2019s exit-meeting snub during an interview Wednesday with team-owned TV station MSG. He said the unexcused absence led to league speculation about Porzingis\u2019s relationship with the club\u2014and provoked inquiries about his trade status.Jackson sounded open to considering it.\u201cAs much as we love this guy,\u201d Jackson said, \u201cwe have to do what\u2019s good for our club.\u201dAt that point, a Knicks fan could not have been blamed if they\u2019d pried their television off the wall and thrown it in the East River.It\u2019s hard to imagine a circumstance in which the Knicks wind up getting equal or superior value for Porzingis. Porzingis is exactly what teams pray a draft pick will become\u2014a young talent who quickly shows an ability to play at a high NBA level, with both the skills and the intangibles to handle the pro game. He is, without a doubt, the greatest achievement of Jackson\u2019s short run as Knicks president, a player whose selection was initially mocked, and is now hailed as one of the great picks in recent years. To abandon him for the unknown\u2014even really good unknown\u2014feels like a toxic, ego-soaked failure. If he does stay, there\u2019s a thick and utterly unnecessary cloud of ugliness to work through.Knicks fans expect this. A once-proud franchise is now a routine dispenser of the soul-crush. It\u2019s as if the team has been built for the sole purpose of emotionally torturing the people who love it the most.On MSG, Jackson was asked what he\u2019d say to fans who were \u201cuneasy\u201d with what was going on.\u201cI think we know what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Jackson said.I can\u2019t say this more emphatically: if you see a Knicks fan today, give them a hug.

He said capacity should open up next week, after the religious Eid holiday.Turkish Economy Minister       Nihat Zeybekci       said that 105 Turkish cargo planes have delivered goods to Qatar so far, where public service ads have popped up on social media explaining the Turkish words for basic goods like milk for the Arab-speaking Qataris.As Turkey\u2019s diplomatic relations with Europe soured, its attention towards the Gulf has grown, both as a destination for Turkish exports and as a source of foreign direct investment.Mr. Erdogan earlier this spring made a pitch for a free trade pact between Turkey and the GCC, as many major Turkish companies do roaring businesses across the Gulf.Turkey\u2019s trade volume with Qatar hit $710 million last year,\u00a0and trade with Saudi Arabia was $5 billion, according to data from the Turkish Statistics Institute.Turkey also relies heavily on both Saudi Arabia and Qatar to achieve its foreign policy goals in the Middle East. Both nations fund Turkish-backed rebel forces in Syria, and both nations have expressed support in President Erdogan\u2019s purges of so-called G\u00fcenists and other political dissidents.So far this month, President Erdogan has spoken with the Saudi, Emirati and Qatari rulers, and his cabinet ministers have engaged in several rounds of shuttle diplomacy.The Turkish leader has been one of the most outspoken allies of Doha. Turkey deployed approximately two dozen troops to Qatar earlier this week as part of a military base agreement with Doha that Turkey\u2019s strengthened in the wake of the political crisis. Ties between the two nations have been deep for several years, including in the business sphere.Despite this, Saudi partners to major Turkish businesses haven't stepped back from their projects or contracts in response to the crisis, according to several Turkish business leaders.Last month national flag-carrier             Turkish Airlines                   also launched its new direct summer flights from Saudi Arabia to multiple tourist destinations in Turkey. Last year, approximately 530,000 Saudi tourists visited Turkey, making them a huge revenue stream for Turkish tourism and retail businesses.Write to Yeliz Candemir at yeliz.candemir@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Saudi Firms Send Goods to Qatar Through Turkey.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 09:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-firms-use-turkey-for-qatar-bound-shipments-1498137554", "news_title": "Saudi Firms Use Turkey for Qatar-Bound Shipments", "keywords": " blockade, diplomatic relations, gulf dispute, islmaic extremism,qatar diplomatic crisis,Gulf Corporation Council,marketing,markets,corporate,industrial news,market research,consumer trends,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,freight transport,logistics,transportation"}, {"content": "Canadian retail sales climbed above expectations in April due to steady buying for building material, hardware and tools, as well as increased activity at gas stations.The value of retail sales rose 0.8% on a seasonally-adjusted basis to 48.6 billion Canadian dollars ($36.6 billion), Statistics Canada said Thursday.

On the shelf, it costs around $50. Only supercharged tequila drinking will justify Diageo\u2019s splurge.The London-listed group announced Wednesday that it had agreed to buy Casamigos for up to $1 billion, comprising a $700 million downpayment and a further $300 million if the brand hits certain milestones. The label was only launched in 2013, but its sprinkling of Hollywood stardust--Mr. Clooney and Rande Gerber founded the company with real-estate man Mike Meldman--has taken the tequila market by storm. It is on track to ship 170,000 cases this year, Diageo said, up from 120,000 last year.Craft beer started squeezing big brewers like Bud-maker             Anheuser-Busch InBev                   in the 2000s, but really took off this decade. It now accounts for about a fifth of U.S. beer sales. Meanwhile, craft liquor represents just 3% of its market, reports Citi, and is only just getting into its stride.Liquor has important differences to beer: The U.S. market is growing faster, thanks to the millennial cocktail craze, and most big brands can boast a craft heritage. Still, established categories like blended scotch--and labels like Diageo\u2019s Johnnie Walker--have found themselves challenged by upstarts. Diageo\u2019s U.S. market share by unit sales was 17.1% last year, down from 17.3% in 2015 and 19.3% in 2012, according to data provider IWSR.Diageo has responded as it can, by investing in booming categories. In January it launched an Irish whiskey, and in March opened a new $115 million bourbon distillery for its Bulleit brand in Shelby County, Kentucky, Mr. Clooney\u2019s home state. Casamigos is another step.There are some worries Diageo is overpaying for a fad: Bernstein estimates that the investment will only cover its cost of capital if Casamigos sales continue to grow by 40% to 50% a year. But the real risk for investors could be that the liquor market fragments further to the benefit of upstarts.

It is one of several places across New Jersey that has a high-level of unmet need for opioid treatment, according to a formula developed by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.Addiction experts increasingly endorse prescription medications, when coupled with counseling, as an effective way of stemming the opioid and heroin crisis that claimed 33,091 lives nationwide in 2015, including 1,600 in New Jersey.Suboxone, made by the U.K.\u2019s             Indivior                   PLC, is one of the most commonly used addiction-treatment drugs. It combines buprenorphine, which reduces withdrawal symptoms and cravings, with naloxone, an opioid antidote, to help people wean themselves off their addictions while minimizing the potential for abuse.Suboxone and similar medications are opioids\u2014although less potent than heroin and methadone\u2014and therefore are highly controlled by the federal government. Providers must complete 8 hours of training and apply for a waiver to prescribe outpatient drugs like Suboxone.More than 36,000 physicians are certified nationwide to prescribe buprenorphine-based drugs, according to federal statistics. Federal regulations previously limited to 100 the number of opioid patients prescribers are allowed to treat with buprenorphine-based medication.Last year the Obama administration increased the patient threshold to 275 and began allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to write prescriptions. So far only a small portion of prescribers, about 3,000, have received approval to treat up to 275 patients.\u201cIf the providers were geographically distributed appropriately and if they all worked at capacity, we would now have adequate capacity,\u201d a federal spokesman said. \u201cBut of course they are not, so there is unmet need.\u201dSome law-enforcement and public-health officials have expressed skepticism about using such prescription medication to break the cycle of addiction. Camden County\u2019s police chief,       J. Scott Thomson,        said improved health care is critical to solving the city\u2019s opioid crisis, but he is wary about the effectiveness of drugs like Suboxone and methadone.\u201cReplacing one drug with another is not the cure,\u201d he said.This concern was echoed by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary       Tom Price       during a May visit to a fire station in West Virginia, where the Charleston Gazette-Mail quoted him as saying medication-assisted treatment is \u201cjust substituting one opioid for another.\u201dAlthough federal regulations seek to limit abuse of Suboxone and similar drugs, misuse does occur. Ms. Sherwood and Mr. Sizemore said most people they know who buy it on the street use the drug to get high.Addiction experts say abuse is limited because it is difficult and costly to get high from buprenorphine-based medications. \u201cThere are other alternatives that are less expensive and more potent,\u201d said       Cynthia Reilly,        director of the Substance Use Prevention and Treatment Initiative at the Pew Charitable Trusts.Brian Colangelo,        the director of mental health for Project H.O.P.E., where Ms. Sherwood said she now receives Suboxone legally, said the center\u2019s waiting list has 700 names on it. The average patient waits about four to five weeks for treatment.\u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing in the world, having that conversation with someone and saying, \u2018Yes we provide treatment, no you cannot have it for no other reason than there\u2019s not enough space,\u2019 \u201d he said.There are only 16 providers in Camden certified to prescribe Suboxone or similar medication, several of whom work at Project H.O.P.E. The center has prescribed Suboxone to more than 600 patients over the past four years, Mr. Colangelo said. It can treat a maximum 200 patients at a time because medication-assisted addiction treatment also requires \u201cfairly intensive\u201d individual and group counseling.\u201cWe need more people in the community providing service,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need more treatment agencies.\u201dOnly about 15% of opioid-addicted patients are able to avoid relapsing without medication, said       Behshad Sheldon,        a former chief executive at Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. who now chairs the Female Opioid Research and Clinical Experts alliance.\u201cClean is not the most important thing. The most important thing is alive and functional,\u201d Ms. Sheldon said. \u201cMost people who are addicted, after a while are no longer trying to get high. They\u2019re just trying to feel normal.\u201dSome people may need to use Suboxone for the rest of their lives, but that scenario is safer than prolonged heroin or opioid addiction, Mr. Colangelo said. He estimated that 95% of his clients have taken it before, with most buying it on the black market.\u201cI would rather have someone take Suboxone illicitly on the street than take heroin,\u201d he said. \u201cHeroin puts them at a much higher risk.\u201dContinuing coverage of how synthetic painkillers became a global menaceAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Opioid Addicts Turn to Streets for Help.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lacking-treatment-options-opioid-addicts-turn-to-black-market-1498132803", "news_title": "Lacking Treatment Options, Opioid Addicts Turn to Black Market", "keywords": "addiction,addiction treatment,buprenorphine,drug treatment,female opioid research and clinical experts,heroin,methadone,naloxone,opiate,opioid,opioid addiction,opioid crisis,opioid crisis in america,opioid epidemic,opioid treatment,opioid withdrawal,overdoses,pew charitable trusts,prescription drug black market,project h.o.p.e.,suboxone,substance abuse,substance abuse treatment,substance use prevention and treatment initiative,Behshad Sheldon,Brian Colangelo,Cynthia Reilly,Diana Sherwood,J.

Haters point to the vehicle\u2019s bread-loaf styling and the \u201cI\u2019ve given up\u201d vibe it exudes. So what are style-conscious Americans to do when they have an abundance of children or gear to haul? Go even bigger. Intended for businesses, commercial passenger vans\u2014the descendants of those that shuttled you to camp or baseball games when you were a kid\u2014are nonetheless becoming the darling of harried families.Although not exactly glamorous, commercial passenger vans have been known to turn heads at the school pickup line or the country-club entrance. The practical appeal is clear: While most minivans and large SUVs can seat seven or eight, the Ford Transit, Mercedes-Benz Sprinter and Chevrolet Express can be configured to accommodate from five to 15. The vans also offer plenty of room in back for your stuff (no need to install a roof rack or haul a trailer.)Unlike the gas-guzzling commercial passenger vans that Detroit\u2019s Big Three began selling in the 1970s, the latest models are notably fuel-efficient, thanks in part to their diesel engines. And the market is growing fast. The Mercedes Sprinter started shaking up the U.S. van world more than a decade ago, but the Transit, NV and Ram ProMaster, from             Fiat                   Chrysler, have arrived more recently to meet demand.\u2018Unlike the gas-guzzling, commercial passenger vans sold in the 1970s, the latest models are markedly more fuel-efficient.\u2019Indeed, big vans have become a bright spot in the U.S. auto market. Sales of full-size commercial vans were up more than 15% in 2016 over the previous year, with some newer models posting huge increases in the same period: ProMaster sales, for example, jumped by 45%.The big vehicles are also attracting buyers with wanderlust. A couple that might otherwise seek out a larger RV can live in one fairly comfortably. Sites like Van Life (van-life.net) and Digital Nomads Forum (digitalnomadsforum.com) offer advice to those looking to use these vans for extended road trips, camping and as full-time mobile homes.Here, an overview of the latest bigger-than-a-minivan options.When Nissan launched its NV passenger van (pictured above) in 2011, the company expected it to appeal to airports, hotels and resorts with shuttle fleets, according to Mark Namuth, Nissan\u2019s senior manager of fleet and commercial sales. \u201cBut the design team was telling us that families were going to buy this vehicle, so we needed to pay more attention to the interior,\u201d he said. Although he doubted the wisdom of investing in better seats, storage and other amenities, he\u2019s glad he relented. \u201cThey were right. We sell about 60% to 70% of our passenger vans to families,\u201d he explained. While other large vans have flat front ends, the NV\u2019s prominent hood gives it a muscular, pickup-truck profile. The design also moves the engine and transmission forward, where they don\u2019t encroach on front-seat space. From $33,800, nissancommercialvehicles.comBased on a Fiat design popular in Europe, this unabashedly boxy van is the shortest bumper-to-bumper\u2014and the only one in this roundup with front-wheel drive. As a result, it turns tightly and parks relatively easily. The standard version is no longer than a             Toyota                   Avalon sedan and handles pretty much like a midsize SUV. Like most of its competition, the ProMaster is available in a range of lengths and roof heights. Although it ships from the factory with up to three front seats, you can outfit this van to seat 15 via one of the many third-party ProMaster \u201cupfitters\u201d out there. From $29,995, ramtrucks.comThough the design of the Chevrolet Express hadn\u2019t evolved in any meaningful way for the past three decades or so, just this year, the Express leaped into the modern age with a new diesel engine\u2014only slightly larger than that in the Mercedes Sprinter\u2014significantly boosting fuel economy. The engine comes with an 8-speed automatic transmission (the most gears in this competitive group) for smoother acceleration and better fuel economy. Car makers aren\u2019t required to publish fuel-economy ratings for big vans, but a Chevy spokesperson said that company staffers have driven the diesel Express thousands of miles at 25 mpg and better. Not bad for a family road trip. From $33,140, chevrolet.com/expressThe Sprinter was the first of the \u201cEuro-style\u201d commercial vans to arrive in the U.S. in the early 2000s. Delivery companies including             FedEx                   snapped them up, despite their relatively steep sticker price, because their fuel economy made them a long-term value. Consumers soon caught on. The Sprinter is available with a four-cylinder diesel engine that might seem underpowered for such a large vehicle, but it has plenty of kick, and the smooth-shifting 7-speed transmission gives the Sprinter surprisingly peppy acceleration. The biggest surprise: When going just under 70 mph on the highway, the Sprinter managed an impressive 28 miles per gallon. From $39,170, mbvans.comUnlike traditional large vans and trucks, whose frames and bodies are fabricated separately and then bolted together, the Transit\u2019s are integrated, just like a traditional passenger car\u2019s chassis and body-panels. This setup stiffens the Transit\u2019s overall structure, resulting in a smoother ride and more agile handling. While the majority of Transits are used in commercial fleets, many customers buy one for personal rather than business use, according to Ford sales analyst       Erich Merkle.       In line with the broader trend, retail sales of the Transit, which include personal-use customers, have risen 7% so far this year.

But there is no missed opportunity bigger than the Cannes pizza delivery boat. A boat. That delivers pizza. As my CMO Today colleague Jack Marshall pointed out on Twitter: Why isn\u2019t an ad tech vendor sponsoring this wonder of a vessel?A lot of visitors to the Cannes ad fest probably think of Reddit as the scruffily-designed link-sharing site that spawns memes and houses endless ideas for agency creatives who have run out of inspiration. The company is in Cannes this week to convince marketers they should be sending more of their money there, as I reported for CMO Today. The site is launching video ads, it has overhauled its self-serve ad platform and there\u2019s finally a desktop redesign on the way that\u2019ll make Reddit look a little less 2005. Reddit has a huge audience and, if brands get it right, can offer the ability to have an actual conversation with their customers. But brand safety is a hot-button topic right now and marketers will need to weigh whether they\u2019re willing to situate themselves in an environment that can easily turn hostile.P&G\u2019s top marketer, Marc Pritchard, kicked off the year with two landmark speeches at advertising events, denouncing the \u201cmurky\u201d and \u201ccrappy\u201d digital media supply chain. His pull-no-punches approach to demand better standards around ad fraud, viewability and third-party measurement appears to have landed. As Marketing Week reports, Mr. Pritchard said at Cannes that the industry is \u201c40-50%\u201d there when it comes to cleaning up that aforementioned supply chain and that by the end of the year, things should be in a lot better shape. Now Mr. Pritchard is firing his \u201ccrap\u201d cannon at content. Publishers need to step up, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crap there and we need to eliminate that so we can get better content to advertise on.\u201d Unilever CMO Keith Weed was also talking about the \u201cmurky\u201d online supply chain on a panel hosted by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cSome marketers likely have woken up to the fact that they might not have been on top of buying media in the way they thought,\u201d he said.Amazon was WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell\u2019s topic du jour on Wednesday. Speaking at a Cannes event hosted by the Financial Times, Mr. Sorrell described the online retail giant as the \u201cgorilla in the room\u201d that is becoming ever more dangerous, given its $13.4 billion acquisition of Whole Foods, CMO Today reported. Mr. Sorrell thinks that could strengthen Amazon\u2019s ability to influence where his clients spend their money because now it\u2019ll have access to data about consumers\u2019 offline shopping behavior. Fortunately, WPP has just the antidote for its clients: it bought a consulting firm that specializes in Amazon -- Marketplace Ignition -- just last month.General Mills appointed former Coke marketer Ivan Pollard as its global CMO, replacing Ann Simonds, who left late last year, Ad Age reported.

The new fund, like the New York one, will be administered by attorneys       Camille Biros       and       Kenneth Feinberg,        who have led similar funds for victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Boston Marathon bombing and other tragic events.Administering the church fund is substantially different than overseeing those for terrorist incidents because so much more time has passed and official documentation usually doesn\u2019t exist, Mr. Feinberg explained.\u201cWe are dealing with very vulnerable victims who in many situations don\u2019t want to revisit all this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are embarrassed and hurt and reluctant.\u201dChurch officials said Ms. Biros and Mr. Feinberg would have \u201ctotal independence\u201d in determining survivors\u2019 compensation. The church officials estimate there are about 280 known victims of abuse in the Diocese of Brooklyn who would initially be eligible.The Diocese of Brooklyn, which represents 1.5 million Catholics, said it would take out a loan to cover compensating survivors, but the total amount of the fund isn\u2019t yet known and would depend on the number of claimants.\u201cI am well aware that no amount of money will ever heal the scars of abuse, but this compensation program is a concrete expression of our contrition and our desire to make amends,\u201d said Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio, who leads the diocese.The fund of the Archdiocese of New York, which represents 2.6 million Catholics, and includes Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and stretches into the Catskills, already had made payments to more than 120 people, Mr. Feinberg said in a statement.J. Michael Reck, a lawyer who represented victims compensated by the New York fund, said his clients\u2019 settlements had ranged from $150,000 to $350,000 each.The announcement of the fund came as advocates for sex-abuse victims held out hope that state legislation widening the statute of limitations would pass this week, but lawmakers adjourned for the session Wednesday night without taking action. Currently, victims have until the age of 23 to pursue a civil or criminal case.The New York State Catholic Conference opposed the legislation, called the Child Victims Act. The Assembly passed it earlier this month with bipartisan support, but the Republican-led Senate stalled it.The timing of the announcement on the new victim\u2019s compensation fund \u201cmeans that the Bishops were, or are, very concerned that the Child Victims Act will pass,\u201d said       Barbara Dorris,        managing director for the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, an advocacy group based in St. Louis.Those who receive payments from the fund must agree not to sue. Victims essentially must choose between seeking compensation now through the fund or waiting to see if the law changes.The biggest downside to the compensation-program process is that the names of accused priests haven\u2019t been released publicly, Ms. Dorris said. \u201cUnless you reveal the names of the predators, they are still out there,\u201d she added.Church officials have said victims aren\u2019t bound by any type of confidentiality agreement and can share details of their cases. A spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York said it goes to great lengths to alert people when a priest is accused of abuse including writing letters to parishioners and putting notices in church publications.Mr. Reck, the lawyer, said for those who qualified for such funds, the settlements brought some closure. But the process lacks the transparency of normal legal procedure, in which both sides share evidence, he said. It also excludes some victims who may have been abused by religious staff not covered by the fund, he added.Because these independent compensation programs don\u2019t operate like the court system they can quickly process claims, Ms. Biros noted.The decision by the two largest dioceses in New York to open victim-compensation funds puts a spotlight on the six other dioceses that span the state.According to a statement posted Thursday on the website of the Diocese of Rockville Centre, which represents 1.4 million Long Island Catholics, the diocese has been considering establishing a fund similar to ones in New York City and Brooklyn. \u201cThis possibility has been the subject of thorough study that is nearly complete,\u201d the statement said.A spokeswoman for the Diocese of Albany said that the funds established by New York and Brooklyn mirror a program created in Albany in 2004 that has paid out about 100 settlements. In that program, according to the spokeswoman, cases were mediated and compensation was paid to victims.George Richert, a spokesman for the Diocese of Buffalo, which represents some 600,000 Catholics, said: \u201cAt this point, we have no current plans\u201d to open a fund. A spokeswoman for the Diocese of Syracuse said it has \u201cno current plans for a mediation program or fund.\u201dThe Diocese of Rochester has long had a process of providing counseling and offering financial assistance to victims, a spokesman said. A spokesman for the Diocese of Ogdensburg didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Outside the St. John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church in Brooklyn, worshiper Eulania Sentino, 57 years old, praised the diocese\u2019s decision to establish a fund, calling it a good first step. \u201cI believe that people need healing, both spiritually and mentally,\u201d she said.Father Astor Rodriguez, pastor of St. John the Baptist, said the church must be held accountable and \u201cwalk with\u201d victims.\u201cThey\u2019ve been victimized once, we don\u2019t need to victimize them anymore,\u201d said Father Rodriguez. \u201cWe have to own up to what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\u2014Mike Vilensky and Mariana Alfaro contributed to this article.Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com and Melanie Grayce West at melanie.west@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/diocese-of-brooklyn-sets-up-fund-for-sexual-abuse-victims-1498129200", "news_title": "Diocese of Brooklyn Sets Up Fund for Sexual-Abuse Victims", "keywords": "brooklyn,diocese of brooklyn,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,sex crimes,religion"}, {"content": "Italy has a potential solution for another of its banking messes, but it involves a state-aid dodge that might stretch Europe\u2019s rules too far.The problem is with the Veneto banks, two merged lenders in dire need of capital even though they were bailed-out by an industry-backed rescue fund only last year.The potential rescuer is banking giant             Intesa Sanpaolo.        ISNPY 0.10%       But it doesn\u2019t want to get its hands dirty. Italy\u2019s second-biggest bank by assets will only do the deal if it is allowed to exclude all the Veneto banks\u2019 bad loans and any that look like they might go bad, as well as ditch all the existing equity and junior bonds of the banks and be indemnified against any legal risks. Oh, and it doesn\u2019t want to pay anything but a token sum, or need to raise capital or cut its dividend.It is as if       Carlo Messina,        Intesa\u2019s CEO, looked at             Banco Santander\u2019srescue of a struggling Spanish bank this month and decided he could go one better. Santander took over all of Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol\u2014good loans and bad\u2014and while it only paid a single euro, it is raising \u20ac7 billion ($7.82 billion) of equity to help fund the assets it is acquiring. Some think those terms were highly favorable.But there is a problem with ensuring Intesa\u2019s expanded balance sheet remains as well capitalized as it is today. For Intesa to acquire the good chunk of the banks\u2019 roughly \u20ac60 billion in assets fully capitalized, the bad bank that is left behind will likely need to impose losses not only on their equity and junior bonds, but on some of their senior bonds, too.If senior bonds take a hit, that could spread panic among other weak Italian banks and even among depositors. To prevent this, taxpayers\u2019 cash will be needed to compensate senior bondholders. But that risks breaching Europe\u2019s stiff state-aid rules.The government has little choice but to get creative. It tried to convince Italy\u2019s biggest lenders to chip in more money to keep the Veneto banks going, but they refused. The government\u2019s next hope is that it can get around state-aid rules by liquidating the banks, like an ordinary company, selling good assets and scrapping the rest, rather than going through the Europe\u2019s bank resolution mechanism. The idea is that state money would be going to wind down a bank, not prop it up.But it is hard to say that Intesa wouldn\u2019t be receiving state aid, at least indirectly, and therefore gaining an unfair competitive advantage. This is a deal almost too good to be true, according to analysts at             Mediobanca,       although a chaotic liquidation could still be worse.Intesa\u2019s local rivals are unlikely to complain\u2014they will have avoided injecting any cash themselves. But other banks in Europe, even Santander, may think this deal goes too far.Write to Paul J.

The ruler and his designated successor were two of the country founder\u2019s dozens of sons, a fractious fraternity that passed along power in an unbroken chain of conservative rule.No longer. Modernity has walloped Saudi Arabia, one of the world\u2019s most ossified societies, and today it is struggling to maintain the economic and political power it built on giant crude-oil reserves.On Wednesday,       King Salman,        81, named his ambitious and confrontational 31-year-old son       Mohammed bin Salman       as his crown prince and successor, in a bid to supercharge an attempt by the country\u2014and the monarchy\u2014to secure its future. The move caps an overhaul rare in Saudi history that has deposed two crown princes and marks the ascent of the youngest ruling generation the kingdom has seen.The young prince is leading what amounts to a national turnaround effort, and his rapid ascent emphasizes the critical nature of that job.Low oil prices and mounting demographic pressures are tearing at the kingdom\u2019s fragile social contract, making change even more urgent and political unity at the top a greater priority. Mohammed bin Salman is spearheading a plan to take the state oil company public in 2018 in what could be the world\u2019s biggest public offering and to invest proceeds in a fund to diversify the country\u2019s economy.The change of power has profound implications for Saudi Arabia\u2019s political and economic future, for global oil markets and for allies inside and outside the Middle East. It casts into retirement the erstwhile crown prince,       Mohammed bin Nayef,        King Salman\u2019s nephew and a longtime antiterror official who had close ties with U.S. diplomats. It empowers a largely untested prince who may become even more powerful than his father, as dissenting factions have been edged out and power is now consolidated in King Salman\u2019s line.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been such a powerful central player since King Abdulaziz,\u201d said Steffen Hertog, a London School of Economics professor who studies Saudi Arabian politics. King Abdulaziz, the father of King Salman, founded the kingdom.The Saudi royal family is increasingly squeezed by perceived threats in the Middle East, most of all the rise of its rival Iran after the end of Western sanctions linked to its nuclear program. Mohammed bin Salman is leading a costly war against Iranian-supported rebels in Yemen who toppled a Saudi-backed government and has inserted Saudi Arabia into the Syrian civil war, backing opponents of Iranian ally President       Bashar al-Assad.       Saudi Arabia has led a jarring diplomatic freeze-out of its onetime ally Qatar, over the tiny emirate\u2019s budding ties to Iran.The young prince\u2019s overtaking of his older cousin has long been viewed as inevitable in some royal circles, according to people familiar with the matter. The timing of the move was cemented by the need to unify the kingdom\u2019s leaders behind the economic overhaul and foreign-policy moves, according to one of the people.\u201cIt is a highly calculated move to make Saudi Arabia as stable as possible,\u201d the person said. \u201cYou need this clarity when you have a big ambitious reform plan you want to achieve.\u201dOne catalyst for the timing of Wednesday\u2019s shuffle: Mohammed bin Nayef\u2019s stance on Qatar. According to two people familiar with the matter, he wanted to resolve the dispute through diplomatic channels, while Mohammed bin Salman wanted to take a harsher stance. Mohammed bin Salman won the argument, and, on June 5, Saudi Arabia announced an economic blockade of Qatar.The succession overhaul that was announced by royal decree\u2014hours after the dawn meal that precedes the daily fast in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan\u2014was expected by some, but the timing may have been accelerated by the Qatar issue, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.In the aftermath of the dispute between Mohammed bin Salman and his cousin, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Allegiance Council, which comprises 34 members of the royal family representing each lineage of Abdulaziz\u2019s sons, met in Mecca this week, said a person familiar with the matter. The council advises the king on matters of succession, but its decisions aren\u2019t binding. Its vote in favor of the leadership shuffle, however, showed there is a consensus within the family about Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s promotion.Indicating a belief that urgent action was necessary, 31 members voted to oust the crown prince and promote Mohammed bin Salman, this person said.In Washington, a senior administration official said the Trump administration knew the change was likely but didn\u2019t know this move would happen today. \u201cWhy now? What\u2019s behind it? Nobody knows,\u201d this person said.Promoting a prince with a more aggressive line on foreign disputes is a change for the country. Its neighbors now see it taking \u201ca much more assertive, insistent domineering\u201d approach to foreign policy, said Chas Freeman, who served as U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia under President George H.W. Bush. \u201cSome of the neighbors regard it as a drive for Saudi hegemony in the region,\u201d he said.The new heir apparent is likely to become the youngest ruler of Saudi Arabia since King Abdulaziz. He has taken a truculent approach to dealing with regional rivalries. In private meetings, he reminds visitors that his nation spends some $60 billion a year on weapons, giving him the \u201cupper hand\u201d over surrounding nations.Mohammed bin Salman will face economic changes that have gained urgency with the oil-price rout. A drop to less than $45 a barrel, down over 60% since 2014, has ushered in a destabilizing period of austerity measures in a kingdom where oil money provided almost 80% of government revenue and underpinned a cozy lifestyle for the Saudi middle class.The kingdom has a growing population of young people who can\u2019t find good jobs, with an unemployment rate over 28% in 2016 for people aged between 20 and 29.Domestically, Mohammed bin Salman has significant support within the swelling ranks of young, foreign-educated Saudis who want more economic opportunity and fewer social restrictions. Since the kingdom\u2019s founding, the royal family\u2019s alliance with religious hard-liners has kept in place severe strictures. Women aren\u2019t allowed to drive and must get permission from relatives to travel abroad or marry.Many young people want to lift such barriers, and Mohammed bin Salman has said he wants to increase the number of women in the workplace. In a country where 45% of the population of 32 million is under 25, that may be a key to economic growth.\u201cMohammed bin Salman needs young people to help him succeed\u2014and young people need him,\u201d said Ahmed Al-Ibrahim, 40, a Saudi business consultant. \u201cHe is ambitious, he has a vision and he delivers. He will push for the separation of mosque and politics.\u201dLast year, the monarchy stripped the country\u2019s religious police of its powers to arrest and instructed its members to behave kindly toward suspected offenders. In a country where cinemas are banned, there is now a government body with the task of promoting entertainment. Government officials often hint the country\u2019s ban on women\u2019s driving will soon be lifted.Before his father became king in January of 2015, Mohammed bin Salman had a relatively low profile in Saudi Arabia. But he had spent years at his father\u2019s side while the future king held a series of government positions.Tall, youthful and bearish, Mohammed bin Salman punctuates his enthusiastic discourses on politics and power with a tic in which he extends his neck and lifts his chin.Since rising in power, he has driven his underlings hard. \u201cIt\u2019s always \u2018right now,\u2019\u00a0\u201d when he\u2019s pushing an initiative, said one high-ranking official. The prince has demanded the IPO of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Saudi Aramco, happen quickly, said people familiar with the matter, and in the view of some officials, he rushed some economic reforms, leading to backlash among citizens.After Salman became king in 2015 upon the death of his older brother Abdullah, another brother, Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, was appointed crown prince. Mohammed bin Salman was appointed defense minister and chairman of the country\u2019s Council for Economic and Development Affairs, putting him at the head of military and economic matters. The king\u2019s young son monopolized the limelight, becoming the face of the kingdom\u2019s ambitious economic overhauls and its war to oust Iranian proxies from Yemen.Crown prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz resigned in April 2015, making room for Mohammed bin Nayef, a nephew of King Salman\u2019s, to become crown prince, and Mohammed bin Salman to become deputy crown prince. That structure was a major shift, as for the first time it named a successor to the throne who would be of the younger generation. It was also the first time a sitting crown prince had been replaced.But Mohammed bin Nayef was also quickly eclipsed by the young Mohammed bin Salman, who announced an economic-overhaul plan called Vision 2030 in 2016. To deal with the impact of low oil prices on the kingdom\u2019s finances, he announced new austerity measures including cuts to public-employee salaries and reduced energy and water subsidies. The cuts were made even more necessary by the expensive war in Yemen against Houthi rebels.As his cousin\u2019s public profile rose, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef spent a long stretch of 2016 on vacation in remote Algeria, and, until September of last year, kept a relatively low profile even when in Riyadh, reinforcing the view that his power was waning.Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s profile meanwhile continued to rise. In January 2016, he announced he planned to take a minority stake in Saudi Aramco public. That plan raised concerns among some within the company about losing control of the source of most of Saudi Arabia\u2019s income.Consumers also griped about some of the subsidy cuts, and business owners had problems with overhaul measures including some designed to increase Saudi employment. Early this year, the prince met with 10 business leaders who complained that few Saudi companies grew last year, while many lost money.Private sector growth was sluggish, they said, and suffered from declining purchasing power of consumers. They said rising fuel costs\u2014the result of subsidy cuts\u2014were hurting them, according to a meeting document the Journal reviewed.Mohammed bin Salman also ran into political challenges with austerity measures aimed at curbing government spending. Late last year, he instituted cuts to government employees\u2019 allowances and bonuses. They proved unpopular, and in April King Salman reversed them as part of a series of decrees that also put two of his other sons in elevated positions, including U.S. ambassador.Known to be intrigued by Wall Street and eager to do deals abroad, he faces the challenge of pulling off the IPO of Saudi Aramco, a complex deal that he has said could value the company at $2 trillion\u2014although inside the company, some officials said that is likely to be less than $1.5 trillion. Mohammed bin Salman has cultivated relationships with bankers and international business figures, seeking advice on how to bring investment into Saudi Arabia and looking for ways to invest the country\u2019s money in industries other than oil.The demands of the prince\u2019s new job stand in stark contrast to the traditional court process that put him in the role. At their Mecca meeting, all but three of the members of the Allegiance Council endorsed the shuffle, according to one official familiar with the vote.In a ceremony broadcast on Saudi television, Mohammed bin Nayef formally acceded to his younger cousin, saying, \u201cI pledge allegiance to you. I am content.\u201dAnd he told his cousin, \u201cGod help you. Now I will rest, and you, God help you.\u201d\u2014Maria Abi-Habib, Margherita Stancati and Carol E.

AMZN 0.24%       is reaching deeper into the supplier world in its bid to carve more business away from retailers. The e-commerce giant has a new deal with             Nike Inc.       to sell some of the sporting apparel maker\u2019s products, the WSJ\u2019s Sara Germano and Laura Stevens report, a concession from Nike that it can no longer afford to ignore the online retailing juggernaut. While Nike sells its shoes and sportswear through department stores and specialty retailers, it has refused to sell directly to Amazon, fearing it would undermine its own brand. But with traffic to traditional stores falling, Nike has been ramping up efforts to sell directly to consumers, especially its own e-commerce efforts. The supplier needs the outlets: the Sports Authority chain collapsed last year under the online competition, and moves by suppliers including             Adidas AG        ADDYY -0.82%       and             Under Armour Inc.        UAA 1.34%       to Amazon have added to the pressure on sporting goods retailers, stress that will only grow as Nike follows the same path.Germany is finding the answer to protectionist trade talk in the U.S. is more business with Asia. The country\u2019s exports to the Far East are surging, the WSJ\u2019s Nina Adam reports, including a 12.3% jump in shipments to China and better-than 20% growth in goods to Indonesia and Vietnam. The export gains come as Germany has come under sharp criticism from President Donald Trump over its large trade surplus with the U.S. The barbs from Washington, along with tensions over issues such as climate, has led European leaders to scale up efforts to cultivate Beijing\u2014and pushed Germany to build on its already-strong trade with China. The country became Germany\u2019s largest trading partner last year, with overall trade of almost $223 billion. Germany\u2019s exports to the U.S. rose 3.9% this year through April, but the numbers suggest the country\u2019s trade interest is heading in another direction.Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       is taking its competition with Amazon to the cloud. The retailer is telling some technology companies they can\u2019t run applications for the company on Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing service if they want to do business with Wal-Mart, the WSJ\u2019s Jay Greene and Laura Stevens report. It\u2019s a rare showdown between companies over third-party suppliers, driven by Amazon\u2019s rise as the dominant provider of on-demand computing power and storage. Wal-Mart says it simply doesn\u2019t want \u201cour most sensitive data\u201d on a competitor\u2019s platform. Some technology vendors say other large retailers also have requested that service providers move away from Amazon Web Services. That push highlights the potential conflicts that are rising as Amazon spreads beyond the nuts-and-bolts of retailing, a growing question in the logistics field as the e-commerce giants builds shipping infrastructure that provides both business and competition to truckers and other operators. For Wal-Mart, there\u2019s no doubt AWS provides troubling competition, bringing Amazon big profits that help offset tight retail margins.Everyone may be bullish about e-commerce, but the cattle aren\u2019t buying it. An online auction meant to help set prices in the volatile cattle market is in trouble, the WSJ\u2019s Benjamin Parkin reports, with technical breakdowns and dwindling participation undermining a business that aimed to bring an ages-old business into the modern trading world. The Fed Cattle Exchange has crashed multiple times in the last month alone, and traders say the auction isn\u2019t providing the promised reality check for pricing in the $19 billion cattle-futures market. Instead, it\u2019s provided a lesson in the difficulty in creating an independent commodity exchange in an industry that\u2019s already created its own processes for managing goods. Public cattle prices became scarce as the share of cattle sold on the open market has fallen, reflecting consolidation among ranchers and meat companies into a few large players that favor contracts over auctions. Still, the market remains so volatile that some traders insist they\u2019ll keep trying to work with the new exchange.\u2018The broader fundamentals frankly didn\u2019t justify oil north of $50.

The opposition is coming both from conservative Republican senators, who believe the proposal doesn\u2019t repeal enough of the Affordable Care Act, as well as GOP centrists, who are upset by deep cuts to Medicaid that would leave more people uninsured. The opposition from both ends leaves GOP leaders with little room to maneuver, though the situation is fluid. Lawmakers at the two ends of the GOP spectrum are also increasingly joining Democrats in criticizing the lack of transparency and rapid-fire timeline for a vote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to release draft legislation this morning; many lawmakers said they hadn\u2019t seen the bill\u2019s text as of Wednesday afternoon.Travis Kalanick\u2019s decision to step down as chief executive of Uber\u2014which stunned his 12,000 or so employees and rippled through Silicon Valley\u2014was the culmination of weeks of maneuvering by some of the ride-hailing company\u2019s biggest backers to oust him. We report that two partners at venture-capital firm Benchmark, one of Uber\u2019s biggest investors, confronted Mr. Kalanick, presenting him with a letter signed by five major shareholders demanding that he immediately resign. After hours of deliberating, he capitulated. Mr. Kalanick\u2019s departure exposes Uber\u2019s leadership shortcomings and raises the question of who can lead a nearly $70 billion company whose defiantly competitive startup culture and leadership style were a reflection of the pugnacious 40-year-old. Assuming there is a magic pill to repair Uber\u2019s culture, the next step will be fixing the business, writes our columnist Christopher Mims.When Salman bin Abdulaziz became Saudi Arabia\u2019s king two years ago, the country\u2019s leadership appeared little different from how it had been for decades.

We look at why King Salman, 81, this week named his ambitious and confrontational 31-year-old son Mohammed bin Salman as his crown prince and successor. Power in Saudi Arabia\u2014for all practical purposes\u2014is now in the hands of a young generation of princes determined to show the Middle East who\u2019s the boss.Politics aside, U.S. travelers really should want\u2014demand\u2014a privatized provider of air-traffic control services, writes our Middle Seat columnist Scott McCartney. Many other countries have shown that it simply works better than having a government bureaucracy directing airplanes. Air-traffic control, or ATC, depends on technology. Better tools can improve safety, shorten flights, get planes out of turbulence faster and reduce delays. Also, privatized ATC providers in Canada, the U.K., Australia and elsewhere have shown they can modernize and continuously upgrade faster than the Federal Aviation Administration. On some key functions, the FAA is more than a decade behind. Opponents warn of higher ticket prices, but passengers are already paying the full load for big bureaucracy through hefty taxes on their tickets.As the iPhone approaches its 10th birthday, our Personal Technology columnist Geoffrey A.

Between fracking, abundant natural gas, the rise of renewables and conservation through efficiency, demand for oil is rising more slowly than the supply. And the only thing dampening supply is price.

Reddit sells sponsored posts, mobile \u201ccards\u201d and banner ad formatsReddit is also partnering with media agencies including WPP\u2019s Essence and             Omnicom Group\u2019s       Resolution Media to build self-service ad products for their clients to use.\u201cReddit is one of advertising\u2019s best kept secrets,\u201d said Sherwin Su, associate director of social at Essence. \u201cAt the core of their platform is a highly passionate and engaged group of users who are influential, authentic and disruptive across the internet.\u201dThe company launched its first official mobile app last year and a desktop redesign is also on the way in the fourth quarter of this year. Desktop ad units, which currently sit at the top of the page, will soon appear in-line with feed. Reddit is also looking at ways to provide more data for marketers about what people are saying about their brands and product categories on the site.\u201cWhat [marketers] are clamoring for most is a dashboard\u201d to monitor their brands, Mr. Ohanian said, although there are no immediate plans to launch one.Reddit was the 64th most-visited website in the U.S. in May with 48 million visitors, according to comScore. Research firm Alexa ranks Reddit as the seventh most visited website worldwide, which demonstrates the opportunity for marketers to reach big audiences on the platform.But there are also challenges. The language shared by Redditors can sometimes be coarse. Marketers may be wary of the appropriateness of their ads appearing against controversial discussion topics. The issue of \u201cbrand safety\u201d drew headlines this year after newspaper reports showed ads next to extremist content on YouTube.Redditors also can be quick to turn on posts they feels are overly-promotional. There\u2019s even a sub-reddit dedicated to shaming company shills they believe are posting on the site, called /r/hailcorporate.But Mr. Ohanian said Reddit can put on the \u201cguard rails\u201d to prevent ads from appearing next to certain communities and keyboards. It is also testing tools with brands including Nintendo, Washington Post and Major League Baseball to help marketers manage their profiles and presence on Reddit, which Mr. Ohanian said has \u201celiminated the stigma of self-promotion.\u201dReddit\u2019s message to marketers is that the benefits of having a dialog with an engaged community outweighs the risks. It does not offer the same level of sophisticated ad-buying, measurement and account management teams that Google or Facebook does.\u201cThe first decade of social has been remarkably anti-social -- all these tools are for broadcasting,\u201d Mr. Ohanian said. \u201cThe places where brands are starting to get real traction is where they are going to have that conversation with customers. Reddit happens to be really good at that.\u201dReddit has grown its team significantly in the two and a half years since Mr. Ohanian and his co-founder       Steve Huffman       returned to the company, having left in 2009 to start up the travel site Hipmunk. Reddit had 65 employees two years ago and now it has 215 people.Mr. Ohanian declined to comment on Reddit\u2019s financial performance. A spokeswoman said 5,000 businesses have used the self-service platform to date. Mr. Ohanian also declined to comment on a Bloomberg report that Reddit is looking to raise a $150 million round of investment that would give the company a valuation of about $1.7 billion.Reddit was founded in 2005 by Mr. Ohanian and his then-fellow university student Steve Huffman. The pair turned down an acquisition offer from Google just months later, although the site was sold a year after to magazine publisher Conde Nast.Conde Nast spun off Reddit in 2011, although it is still a shareholder in the company. Reddit has raised just over $50 million in funding to date, according to CrunchBase.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to be dependent on fundraising,\u201d Mr. Ohanian said. \u201cThe strongest position any company can be in is being able to grow your own destiny.\u201dWrite to Lara O\u2019Reilly at lara.o'reilly@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 06:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddit-looks-to-lure-advertisers-with-video-and-redesign-1498125600", "news_title": "Reddit Looks to Lure Advertisers With Video and Redesign", "keywords": "cannescmo,reddit,internet search engines,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "House Republicans are struggling to agree on a plan to fund the federal government for 2018, a critical task that they must tackle before moving ahead with ambitions for a tax overhaul.Defense hawks want to boost military spending above levels imposed by spending curbs established six years ago. But many Republicans aren\u2019t willing to support the higher spending absent spending cuts elsewhere, as they are trying to balance the federal budget over the next decade without raising taxes.The debate has delayed GOP efforts to move forward with a budget resolution\u2014which Republican lawmakers plan to use as a tool to advance their tax plan\u2014as well as spending bills needed to keep the government running once its current funding expires\u00a0Oct. 1.Time isn\u2019t on their side: Congress leaves for a weeklong recess for the Fourth of July and will be out for five weeks starting\u00a0July 28, leaving little room on the legislative calendar.\u201cThe sticking points are all good sticking points,\u201d said Rep.       Jim Renacci       (R., Ohio), a member of the budget committee, who said the panel is trying to come up with a budget as quickly as possible. \u201cYou have people who want to spend more on defense. You\u2019ve got people who want to curtail spending.\u2026In the end, we\u2019ve got to do a little bit of both.\u201dSome Republicans want to see military spending boosted to $640 billion, well above current law\u2019s limit of $549 billion for fiscal year 2018. They argue that the spending caps are harming national security and should be lifted, especially in a time of heightened geopolitical risk.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done to our defense is nearly criminal, and our ability to defend ourselves has absolutely been impacted,\u201d said Rep.       Chris Stewart       (R., Utah), a former Air Force pilot who supports the $640 billion level for defense spending.Most Republicans, however, wouldn\u2019t support increased military spending without corresponding cuts to other parts of the budget. The problem is that Republicans have spent years slimming down nondefense discretionary spending, leaving less to trim at this point. Many of them balked at cuts that President       Donald Trump\u2019s       budget proposed to popular programs and agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and regional economic development programs.\u201cWhile there is obviously waste and duplication, there are a lot of important things the federal government does, from defense, food safety, medical research, lots of things,\u201d said Rep.       Frank Lucas       (R., Okla.).Democrats have said they are willing to boost defense spending, but not without an increase in nonmilitary spending, as well.\u201cWe have to have a responsible budget,\u201d said Sen.       Ben Cardin       (D., Md.) \u201cI don\u2019t think you can just say add one and cut the other.\u201dThe House Budget Committee is aiming to mark up the budget resolution as early as next week.House Republicans said they were presented five options for how to proceed with the spending bills and a budget resolution this year at a meeting with GOP leadership\u00a0Wednesday. But there was no consensus on the best path forward.Many said they were inclined to try to pass an omnibus, a package of 12 spending bills set at levels that would represent a GOP wish list. Republicans acknowledged that this bill would stand no chance of passing the Senate, where Democratic support will be needed. Spending bills require 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles in the Senate, and Republicans hold 52 seats.Some House Republicans said they wanted to pass a bill that reflected their spending priorities to strengthen their hand in negotiations with Democrats. But others sounded a note of skepticism that the exercise would be meaningful, given the crowded legislative calendar.\u201cI prefer to do things for real,\u201d Mr. Lucas said.Most House Republicans say they will ultimately have to deliberate with Democrats, who will have leverage in both chambers, since the House Republican leaders rarely have enough votes to pass spending bills with just GOP votes.After the partial government shutdown in the fall of 2013, Sen.       Patty Murray       (D., Wash.) and Rep.       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.), now the House speaker, struck a two-year spending deal. Former House Speaker       John Boehner       (R., Ohio), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and former President       Barack Obama       struck another two-year deal in the fall of 2015, which ends in October.\u201cWhat we need is another Ryan-Murray sort of proposal to take us forward,\u201d Rep.       Mike Simpson       (R., Idaho), a veteran member of the House Appropriations Committee, said\u00a0Wednesday. Mr. Simpson said there was discussion of tying a debt-limit increase to the spending bills, but that remained under discussion.Without a bipartisan agreement, lawmakers would likely have to pass a short-term spending bill, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t acceptable to most of us,\u201d said Rep.       Charlie Dent       (R., Pa.), a centrist and member of the House Appropriations Committee.\"Most people acknowledge that there will be a bipartisan budget agreement at the end of the year,\u201d said Mr. Dent, who also said he wants to tie the agreement to an increase in the debt limit.Another option would be to package together four or five spending bills relating to defense and national security that lawmakers would pass before they leave for the August recess. That would allow members to work toward an agreement on the remaining bills before they return in September, said Rep.       Hal Rogers       (R., Ky.), a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, who said he favors that approach.He acknowledged that a new, bipartisan budget deal may be necessary if such a measure exceeds the current spending caps. \u201cThat\u2019s being worked on in the budget committee and leadership,\u201d he said.Republicans will meet again\u00a0on Friday\u00a0to discuss plans for passing spending bills in the little time left to them before October.Mr. Ryan said\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0that Republicans were still grappling with how to resolve those internal differences.\u201cWe\u2019re having that family conversation. We all recognize that in the first year of any new presidency you have a constrained budget process, and that\u2019s clearly the case here,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, referencing the later-than-usual arrival of the president\u2019s full budget. \u201cWe haven\u2019t decided exactly how we\u2019re going to go about our appropriations process in this first year.\u201dWrite to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com, Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 06:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rift-delays-house-gop-efforts-on-budget-resolution-1498125603", "news_title": "Rift Delays House GOP Efforts on Budget Resolution", "keywords": "budget negotiations,congress,u.s. military spending,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house"}, {"content": "Some businesses owned by       Donald Trump       saw\u00a0their revenue\u00a0decline since his presidential campaign entered full force and he became president, but one operation enjoyed a windfall: a Las Vegas tower that opened nearly 10 years ago, a new disclosure form shows.Mr. Trump reported receiving\u00a0about\u00a0$66 million from the Las Vegas condo and hotel tower bearing his name from January 2016 through April 2017. That was\u00a0about\u00a0$20 million more than he reported receiving from the building a year earlier.Mr. Trump owns 50% of Trump Ruffin LLC, the company that owns the tower, called Trump International Hotel Las Vegas. A business partner,       Phil Ruffin      \u2014a top donor\u00a0to Mr. Trump during the campaign who has since served on his transition and inaugural committees\u2014owns the other half.The disclosures were made in a federal financial form that\u00a0was\u00a0released publicly\u00a0Friday. This latest filing presents a glimpse into Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses during the campaign and presidency.In total, the New York businessman reported\u00a0at least $1.4 billion in assets, generating nearly $600 million in revenue and\u00a0$316\u00a0million in liabilities, roughly similar to the previous reporting period. The time periods covered by the two reports include some overlapping months.The filing gave financial estimates for hundreds of private companies owned\u00a0in full or part\u00a0by Mr. Trump, but left open\u00a0questions\u00a0about some of the specific sources of income.Overall, about 20% of Mr. Trump\u2019s companies saw revenue decline, while around 15% saw revenue rise.Some of the gains appeared to be tied to Mr. Trump\u2019s political success.\u00a0His Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, which\u00a0he has visited frequently as president and where membership initiation fees were doubled, reported $37.2 million in revenue\u2014$7.5 million more than in a financial disclosure in May 2016.Mr. Trump\u2019s private air fleet\u2014to which his campaign paid $6.6 million over the election cycle\u2014brought in $7.7 million in income in the latest disclosure, up from $3.7 million in the 2016 report.Sales of the president\u2019s 1987 book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d rose to between $100,000 and $1 million in the latest disclosure, up from between $50,000 and $100,000 in the 2016 report. Mr. Trump frequently touted the book while campaigning.Mr. Trump\u2019s newly opened Washington, D.C., hotel saw a revenue gain of around $19 million over the prior reporting period.\u00a0A\u00a0Vancouver, Canada, hotel and condo tower that bears his name and opened earlier in 2017 reported over $5 million in revenue.The filing gave little explanation for some other businesses that saw gains, including\u00a0Trump\u00a0Corp., which\u00a0reported\u00a0more than $12 million in additional revenue for\u00a0\u201cmanagement and related fees.\u201d\u00a0People familiar with the Trump Organization said Trump\u00a0Corp. in the past has managed the company\u2019s New York condo units.Other possible gains or losses at some of his businesses were difficult to ascertain. Government financial reporting experts said the disclosure forms, designed primarily to account for ownership in publicly traded companies to limit conflicts of interest by government officials, are of limited value for the complex nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses.\u201cGiven the number of businesses he has and the number of various arrangements he has, it\u2019s very hard to tell the scope of any possible entanglements,\u201d said Larry Noble, general counsel at Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group that advocates for reducing the influence of money in politics.The Trump Organization, including Mr. Trump\u2019s son Eric and other company officials running the businesses while Mr. Trump is president, didn\u2019t respond to questions about the disclosures.In Las Vegas, the additional funds generated by the tower were poured into entities that hadn\u2019t collected any money the previous two years. They were described in the financial disclosure as $8 million in \u201cdevelopment fees,\u201d $14 million in \u201ccommissions\u201d and about $3 million in\u00a0\u201csponsor fees.\u201dMr. Ruffin, a casino operator and Mr. Trump\u2019s partner in Las Vegas, has told The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets that he would like to develop a new building there\u00a0with the Trump Organization, possibly a casino. Yet there are no development plans moving forward, a person familiar with the project said.The extra money to Mr. Trump came from fees he was owed from the\u00a0condo-hotel\u00a0from years earlier but had been deferred, this person said. Mr. Trump was now able to collect the money because the project was in better financial shape, this person said.The Las Vegas tower, which doesn\u2019t include a casino, opened in 2008 amid the financial crisis.\u00a0Many of the initial condo buyers weren\u2019t able to close on their units.Mr. Trump and his partner refinanced debt on the project.\u00a0That involved Mr. Trump deferring some of the fees he was to collect, according to       Steve Schlesinger,        an attorney who worked for Mr. Trump at the time.\u2014Andrea Fuller and Peter Grant contributed to this article.Write to Alexandra Berzon at alexandra.berzon@wsj.com and Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/revenue-slides-at-some-trump-businesses-but-vegas-tower-brings-windfall-1498123804", "news_title": "Revenue Slides at Some Trump Businesses, but Vegas Tower Brings Windfall", "keywords": "conflict of interest,las vegas,trump,trump businesses,trump disclosure,trump hotel,trump organization,Trump Organization,Donald Trump,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "The Federal Reserve is releasing the results of its annual stress tests of big banks in two parts, on Thursday, June 22, and Wednesday, June 28. Here is what you need to know about the exams.What do the tests assess?A stress test is an examination of what would happen to a bank if it ran into trouble. At its core, the test is a mathematical forecast of what would happen to a bank given certain events, such as a significant increase in unemployment or a drop in oil prices. In the Fed\u2019s tests, the central bank is the teacher and the banks are the students. The banks are required to submit their tests, also called \u201ccapital plans,\u201d to the Fed. The Fed then decides whether the banks pass or fail, i.e. whether it approves or rejects the plans.Why should I care about stress tests?Big banks and their regulators weren\u2019t prepared for the 2008 financial crisis, resulting in bailouts and problems across the global economy. The point of the tests is to make it more likely banks and regulators are ready for the next crisis\u2014for example, by forcing banks to maintain additional cushions against losses if the economy starts to worsen. By publishing the results, regulators also seek to give the public confidence that the banking system is sound.The tests are also important for investors in U.S. banks because if banks fail, they aren\u2019t allowed to increase the amount of money they return to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks. This year, investors in many banks are hoping for bigger payouts, which could be announced once the test results are public.What happens this week versus next week?The first announcement, on Thursday, June 22, shows the Fed\u2019s assessment of the banking system as a whole but not whether banks passed or failed. The central bank publishes its calculations of how banks fared during the hypothetical scenarios, but these first \u201cquantitative\u201d results assume that banks haven\u2019t changed any of their plans for returning capital to shareholders. That allows the public to compare banks\u2019 capital levels.Next Wednesday, June 28, the Fed will say whether banks have passed or failed. It publishes a second version of the \u201cquantitative\u201d results, this time reflecting the individual capital plans of each bank. It also describes any \u201cqualitative\u201d problems it found at individual banks. Sometimes, a bank is deemed to pass the tests but with a stipulation: It has to fix concerns raised by the Fed within six months and resubmit its plan.Which banks take the tests?Different countries have different stress-testing requirements. In the U.S., any banks with more than $50 billion in assets must take the Fed tests. This year, that includes 34 firms\u2014both U.S.-based banks and the American units of big global banks.How do the tests work?Each year, the Fed publishes two hypothetical scenarios of adverse economic conditions such as high unemployment or a drop in the value of the stock market. Banks calculate how their loans and investments would perform under the scenarios, which last for nine quarters, and submit the results to the Fed along with a lengthy description, often thousands of pages, documenting and justifying the bank\u2019s results. Separately, the Fed does its own calculations.How are banks deemed to pass or fail the tests?Ultimately, that decision is up to the Fed, which examines banks in both \u201cquantitative\u201d and \u201cqualitative\u201d areas.The \u201cquantitative\u201d part of the test looks at bank capital, the money banks raise from investors or earn through profits. Like any other company, if a bank continually loses money, it eventually runs out of capital and goes bankrupt.During the hypothetical recession, each bank must maintain an amount of capital that meets or exceeds a minimum set by the Fed. The bank must maintain that amount under its own calculations, as well as the calculations performed by the Fed. If the bank has extra capital during the tests, the Fed may allow the bank to return that money to shareholders. If the bank falls below the minimum capital requirement, the Fed judges the bank as having failed the test and rejects its plan to return capital.The second part of the test looks at what the Fed calls \u201cqualitative\u201d factors. Generally, these include whether the bank has a clear sense of the risks it faces. For example, can the bank quickly calculate its exposure to financial problems in each of the countries where it operates? If not, the Fed might give it a failing grade.Banks typically must succeed on both parts of the tests to pass. This year, the Fed eased up and said only 13 large, complex banks must pass the qualitative exam. The remaining 21 banks only need pass the quantitative part.What is different from last year?The Fed always changes the hypothetical stress scenario from year to year, often emphasizing issues that have worried regulators. This year\u2019s \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenario includes stress in markets for corporate loans and commercial real estate, as well as a severe global recession. (The Fed emphasizes that the scenarios aren\u2019t meant to be a prediction.)As mentioned, this year the qualitative portion of the tests will only apply to 13 of the largest, most complex banks. Any bank with less than $250 billion in total assets and less than $75 billion in nonbank assets is exempt from the qualitative exam.That effectively makes the test easier for many firms. For instance, the U.S. unit of Spanish bank             Banco Santander SA       has failed the tests for qualitative reasons three years running. A U.S. unit of Deutsche Bank has failed the qualitative test twice in a row. Neither of those subsidiaries must take the qualitative exam this year, so those firms are breathing easier.Bank investors are also hoping that the Fed will allow banks to be more aggressive in returning capital to their shareholders, given that banks have raised their capital levels significantly in recent years. They will have to watch the results to find out.Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-are-the-feds-stress-tests-1498123802", "news_title": "What Are the Fed\u2019s Stress Tests?", "keywords": " bank capital,big banks, capital cushion, fed stress tests, stress tests, too big to fail,Federal Reserve,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,banking,central banking,commercial banking,financial investments,investment banking,credit,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Forget Bette Midler. The reigning star of the New York theater scene is proving to be none other than President Donald Trump.And his presence goes far beyond the Public Theater\u2019s controversial recent production of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d at Central Park in which the Roman leader took on the guise of our current commander-in-chief.A number of other shows that parody Mr. Trump or speak to the political climate under his watch are playing in New York City or slated to open in the coming weeks. And while most are targeted to a left-leaning audience\u2014no surprise in a heavily Democratic city\u2014they could provoke a strong response from the right, with a potential host of consequences, financial and otherwise.The productions often are marked by a deep vein of anger, frustration and distrust when it comes to Mr. Trump. But they also look at the president with a comedic eye, lampooning his physical presence in some instances.Producers and creators say they are simply speaking to today\u2019s political reality.\u201cWe have to react to what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Nancy Holson, who wrote the book and lyrics for \u201cMe The People: The Trump America Musical.\u201dMs. Holson\u2019s show, which starts running at off-Broadway\u2019s Triad Theater this weekend, skewers the president and the broader conservative agenda through songs that look at everything from Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare to the relationship between Mr. Trump and Russia.Such shows aren\u2019t likely to play well with conservatives, though they say they didn\u2019t expect much else from the cultural community.\u201cBeing in poor taste is nothing new for the art world,\u201d said New York City Councilman Joseph Borelli, a Republican from Staten Island who endorsed Mr. Trump during his presidential run.Mr. Borelli added that while he was a proponent of free speech, he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this next wave of anti-Mr. Trump productions was greeted with protests, especially from a young generation of conservative activists. Indeed, protesters interrupted performances of \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d toward the end of the show\u2019s run.The White House declined to comment on the spate of shows.The New York theater world has something of a tradition of putting presidents under the critical microscope. The \u201860s saw \u201cMacBird!,\u201d a satirical show that reimagined the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency as Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cMacbeth\u201d and played in a Greenwich Village theater for close to a year. More recently, comedic actor Will Ferrell brought \u201cYou\u2019re Welcome America,\u201d his spoof of President George W. Bush, to Broadway in 2009 for a two-month run.Some of the new productions take the critiques and portrayals of the president to a whole other level. Consider Paul David Young\u2019s \u201cFaust 3: The Turd Coming, or The Fart of the Deal,\u201d now playing at the Judson Memorial Church in Manhattan.Mr. Young, a playwright whose work previously has been staged in New York, views Mr. Trump through the devilish lens of the Faust story, but with a darkly comic\u2014and very scatological\u2014twist. Much of the play is devoted to the subject of presidential excrement.To put matters more over the top, Mr. Young has his cast sporting clown makeup. His rationale? The president \u201cdoes look like a clown,\u201d he said.Broadway also will get a presidential presence, so to speak. Provocative film director Michael Moore will debut on Broadway with a one-man show starting July 28.Dubbed \u201cThe Terms of My Surrender,\u201d the production is being billed as an anti-Mr. Trump diatribe. A news release announcing the show stated: \u201cSo, the question is posed. \u2018Can a Broadway show take down a sitting president? \u2019\u201dParodying the president can have financial consequences.The nonprofit Public Theater saw the loss of two corporate sponsors, Bank of America and Delta Air Lines, as a result of its \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d production. Bank of America said it would support the Public Theater\u2019s other efforts, however.The move by the companies came after some on the right said the staging crossed a line, most notably because Caesar is assassinated in the show\u2014and in the Public Theater\u2019s case, it was a particularly bloody scene.This may be less of an issue for the new presidential-themed theatrical offerings because they are being produced by for-profit enterprises and aren\u2019t reliant on outside support.

Last year, Paris relocated thousands of refugees to other parts of France.Their return is likely to exacerbate tensions along the channel just as Brexit negotiations get under way. Immigration to the U.K. of both documented and undocumented migrants was a major factor in Britain\u2019s vote last year to leave the economic bloc. Mr. Macron has said that in light of Brexit, France and the U.K. should renegotiate a 2003 border treaty that put the onus on France to secure the border.Under that agreement, known as the Touquet accords, London provides some border agents and helps finance security walls and razor wire on the French side of the channel to keep migrants from entering the tunnel that carries trains and trucks under the waterway.But France processes the vast majority of asylum claims made by those hoping to reach the U.K. French police also deploy in large numbers across the port to not only bar entrance to the tunnel, but also maintain public order in areas that are seasonally flooded with migrants.On Tuesday, a truck driver died in an accident after migrants placed tree trunks on the highway, police said. Migrants typically obstruct the roadways leading into the tunnel so they can clandestinely board the vehicles and sneak into the U.K. Nine Eritreans were detained by French police.About 30 migrants are discovered every day hiding in the back of a truck at border controls, said Gilles Debove, a police officer in Calais. \u201cIt\u2019s starting again.\u201dThe perennial problem has fueled support around Calais for the far-right National Front. Half of the eight National Front candidates elected to Parliament last week\u2014including party leader       Marine Le Pen      \u2014will represent areas around Calais.For more than a decade, migrants have taken advantage of the free movement within the EU to hopscotch across the region and reach their preferred destinations. The U.K. remains a magnet due to its looser labor rules, multicultural cities and the ability of many migrants to speak at least some English.Farid Kahn, a 23-year-old from Afghanistan, arrived in Calais a few weeks ago after transiting through Italy.\u201cI sold three homes in Afghanistan to pay for my journey to England,\u201d he says. \u201cI speak English and studied computer science. I could get a job there.\u201dMr. Macron says the solution to stemming the flow of migrants is to reinforce the borders of countries at the edge of the EU, such as Greece and Italy. A staunch pro-European, he doesn\u2019t want to restrict travel between France and its European neighbors\u2014a measure favored by Ms. Le Pen.\u201cMacron wants to let migrants into the country, but he does nothing to take care of them,\u201d says Emanuel Candas, 52, an employee at a mechanical contractor who works across the street from an area where meals are distributed by aid workers in Calais.One way for Mr. Macron to relieve political pressure is to make it easier for migrants bottled up in Calais to leave France. The Touquet accords aren\u2019t part of Brexit negotiations, and Mr. Macron has pledged not to engage in separate bilateral talks with the U.K. that might undercut negotiators in Brussels. Still, the accords allow either of the signatories to withdraw unilaterally.For now, French authorities continue to play cat-and-mouse. Migrant camps were dismantled in 2002 and 2009, but many more returned in subsequent years.On a recent afternoon, a white truck carrying food for migrants parked near a canopy of trees. About 400 migrants emerged from hiding to stock up on supplies. Moments later, police came and chased them away.Aid workers say police are using excessive force against migrants and trying to prevent them from distributing meals.On Thursday, a spokesman for the French government said police chiefs \u201chad been given instructions for more flexibility and humanity to be shown.\u201dJimmy Sami, a 17-year-old from Eritrea, was back in Calais after fleeing the Hollande government\u2019s relocation program. He lived in the streets of Paris before returning to the port town in May to make another attempt at crossing the channel.\u201cI don\u2019t want to stay in France,\u201d Mr. Sami said.Write to Noemie Bisserbe at noemie.bisserbe@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Migrants Stream Back to \u2018Jungle\u2019.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/migrants-return-to-frances-jungle-in-calais-1498123801", "news_title": "Migrants Return to France\u2019s \u2018Jungle\u2019 in Calais ", "keywords": "asylum,brexit,calais,english channel,jungle,migrant crisis,migrants in europe,touquet accords,Emmanuel Macron,political,general news,international relations,disasters,accidents,migration,man-made disasters,politics,domestic politics,transport accidents,transport"}, {"content": "Apple\u00a0Inc.        AAPL 0.63%       is broadening its push into India,\u00a0perhaps the iPhone\u2019s last great growth market.The company\u2019s first ever Indian-made iPhones began selling locally this month with hopes reduced prices will boost sales in the sprawling country where Apple\u00a0has just 3% of the smartphone market.The Cupertino, Calif.,\u00a0company\u00a0is considering opening flagship stores in India\u2019s megacities and\u00a0is helping\u00a0hundreds of third-party resellers\u00a0 open\u00a0new shops at an unprecedented pace. It also has set up development centers to build apps for Indian customers and enhance local mapping capabilities.While Apple\u2019s strategy typically is to sell high-price handsets to telecom carriers, its effort in India reflects the realities of an emerging market where wages are low, cellular speeds are sluggish and consumers mostly buy phones from small, unaffiliated shops. The company also must overcome weak brand awareness and its relatively late arrival in a market where Samsung Electronics Co. has a head start.\u201cIt\u2019s not a push for premium\u2014it\u2019s a push to sell\u00a0an\u00a0Apple\u00a0device by any means necessary,\u201d said Lauren Guenveur, an analyst with market research firm Kantar Worldpanel.India, already the world\u2019s second-largest mobile market after China, is expected to add more mobile subscribers\u2014310 million\u2014than any other country in the four years through 2020, according to estimates from GSMA, a global association of mobile-service providers.\u00a0Apple\u00a0wants to make sure all the growth doesn\u2019t go to Samsung and\u00a0rising Chinese competitors such as Xiaomi Corp. and             Lenovo Group Ltd.There is \u201ca lot of headroom [in India] in our mind, and so we are working very hard to realize that opportunity,\u201d Chief Executive       Tim Cook       said on a call with investors in October.Samsung, which holds 27% of India\u2019s smartphone market, announced this month it was doubling its capacity in India with a $760 million investment in its smartphone and refrigerator factory outside India\u2019s capital.Chinese brands such as\u00a0BBK Electronics Corp.\u2019s Oppo and Vivo are rapidly gaining ground, with their 50% share of the smartphone market in the first quarter representing a doubling from a year earlier, according to Kantar Worldpanel.Apple\u00a0may need to temper investor expectations in India where by 2020 it is likely to increase its market share to just 5% worth about $10 billion, not much for a company with more than $215 billion in annual revenue, said Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba.\u201cThey can\u2019t ignore it,\u201d Mr. Lamba said \u201cBut it\u2019s not enough to move the needle.\u201dIndia is using its giant domestic market to woo global manufacturers, charting a different path to development than that of the export-powered economies of Japan, South Korea and China. If a lower-cost iPhone became popular with a rising middle class of Indian consumers, production could be expanded and more jobs could be created\u2014which in turn would help lift living standards and discretionary spending. It is comparable to what Ford\u2019s inexpensive Model-T did a century ago for the young, up-and-coming economy in the U.S.India has worked hard to persuade Apple to produce phones locally. The government has eased foreign-investment restrictions, with an eye toward fostering an ecosystem of phone-parts manufacturers to supply international electronics makers. The effort is in keeping with Prime Minister       Narendra Modi\u2019s       Make in India initiative.Under investment restrictions, foreign-owned single-brand retailers like Apple were required to source around 30% of their products locally in order to open their own shops. Apple\u00a0was rejected when it pushed for that restriction to be waived. New Delhi later said companies could be given three years to reach the requirement, according to government officials.Apple\u00a0was also refused permission to import used iPhones to be refurbished and sold in India, said one Trade Ministry official who asked not to be named.\u201cThe government is eager to have the world\u2019s most-valued company have its operations here,\u201d\u00a0the official\u00a0said. \u201cWe hope something mutually agreeable is worked out in near future.\u201dWhen the company decided to make its own phones here,\u00a0Apple\u00a0picked Taiwan\u2019s             Wistron Corp.       to begin assembling the\u00a0iPhone\u00a0SE, its least expensive model, with production starting in May.The high prices on iPhones are the biggest reason Apple can\u2019t sell more in India. Analysts estimate more than 75% of the smartphones sold in the country sell for less than $250 and 95% sell for less than $500. The iPhone\u00a0SE was introduced last year at about $600 and now sells for around $325\u2014could fall further to a level more Indians can afford.If it were priced below $300, the model could win buyers now spending a similar amount for higher-end Android phones, said Faisal Kawoosa, principal analyst at research firm CMR.Apple has been trying to expand its distribution network in India, where about 85% of smartphone sales occur across a fragmented network of small retailers, according to Mizuho Securities. Apple\u00a0supports resellers with marketing materials, furniture and other assistance. It plans to back 200 new stores in the next year,\u00a0according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s thinking.As it plunges into India, Apple\u00a0faces a consumer-awareness problem, with nearly half the population unfamiliar with the brand, according to a Morgan Stanley survey. To build awareness, the company\u00a0has\u00a0been considering\u00a0opening flagship stores in\u00a0New Delhi, the tech hub of Bangalore and the financial center of Mumbai, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s plans.Meanwhile,\u00a0Apple\u00a0is doubling down on content. In March, it opened\u00a0an app-development center in Bangalore to help coders making iOS apps for India. The country has nearly 3 million mobile app developers, but fewer than 15% of those make iOS products, said Jayanth Kolla, founder of research firm Convergence Catalyst. Apple\u00a0has also opened an office in Hyderabad to boost mapping capabilities.Of course, Indians don\u2019t have to buy iPhones to bond with the\u00a0Apple\u00a0brand. In a bid to get young users hooked, Apple this year started offering Indian college students its Apple Music service, which is also available on Android devices, for the equivalent of 93 cents a month\u2014less than one fifth the cost in the U.S.\u2014Karan Deep Singh in New Delhi contributed to this article.Write to Newley Purnell at newley.purnell @wsj.com, Rajesh Roy at rajesh.roy@wsj.com and Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.comAppeared in the June 23, 2017, print edition as 'Apple Recharges Effort in India.'", "news_time": "2017-06-22 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-scraps-like-an-underdog-in-second-biggest-mobile-market-1498123803", "news_title": "Apple Scraps Like an Underdog in Second Biggest Mobile Market ", "keywords": "chinese smartphones,developing economies,india mobile market,indian economy ,silicon valley, smartphone,tech companies,Apple,AAPL,Samsung Electronics,005930.SE,BBK Electronics,KR:005930,Abhey Lamba,Faisal Kawoosa,Jayanth Kolla,Lauren Guenveur,new products,services,marketing,markets,branding,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,personal technology,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications technology,equipment,mobile communications equipment,personal electronics,audio,video equipment,cellular,mobile phones,consumer goods,durable household products,handheld electronic devices,home electronics,appliances,smartphones,technology"}, {"content": "LE BOURGET, France\u2014Escalating concerns about cyberthreats are prompting the aviation industry to devise an unlikely new safeguard: real-time warnings to pilots about\u00a0potential hacking attempts.Work to develop such systems, which have prompted disagreements between some in the industry, are part of separate efforts by France\u2019s             Thales SA,        HO -0.15%Raytheon Co.        RTN 0.61%       and other companies to expand cyber protections for aircraft.             Airbus SE        EADSY 1.15%       and             Boeing Co.        BA 1.27%       support the pilot-alerting goal, reflecting a desire to try new things as global threats intensify and evolve.But interviews at the Paris Air Show showed there isn\u2019t an industrywide consensus on the concept, a version of which is under development and could start to be tested on some commercial aircraft by late 2018. Large suppliers such as             Honeywell International Inc.        HON 0.71%       and             Rockwell Collins Inc.        COL 0.98%      \u2014which provide cockpit equipment for many airliners\u2014are skeptical about the need for such proposed capabilities.The debate isn\u2019t likely to affect cybersecurity systems on today\u2019s airliners or even those built in the next few years, though it could impact how the digital cores of future models will be protected.Proponents of alerting see advanced systems on aircraft as being able to identify attempted or successful cyberintrusions, with the data feeding into artificial intelligence features powerful and adaptable enough to automatically respond to the hazard.\u201cThe conventional ways by which we\u2019ve protected ourselves in cyber may need to change\u201d as threats evolve, said       Greg Hyslop,        Boeing\u2019s chief technology officer.Allan McArtor,        chairman of the Airbus unit that operates in the U.S., Canada and Latin America, also sees a need for greater industry sophistication in battling potential cyberthreats. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to make a very convincing argument\u201d to the public about why aircraft are safe from outside intrusion, he said. What is missing, he added, is \u201ca convincing cyberthreat architecture that allows us to be aware of attacks\u201d when they take place, including warnings going directly to the cockpit.The push for new approaches generally tracks recommendations from an earlier U.S. government-backed study group. The group of experts also concluded that airline vulnerabilities extend to maintenance operations that can allow outsiders to gain unauthorized access to aircraft systems.In September, the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s top technical advisory group adopted language seeking to ensure that cybersecurity protections would be incorporated into all future industry standards\u2014affecting everything from aircraft design to flight operations to maintenance practices.Thales decided years ago that it wasn\u2019t sufficient to merely devise elaborate protections. \u201cWe must have some real-time capabilities to detect and respond\u201d if an intrusion is under way, said Thomas Hutin, one of the company\u2019s top cybersecurity officials. He wouldn\u2019t reveal which airline signed up to participate in the testing phase, but the goal is to send a real-time alert and have crew members react based on \u201ca very detailed set of procedures\u201d that they were trained to use.Carl Esposito, president of Honeywell\u2019s Electronics Solutions Business unit, sees no need for such drills, pointing to the extraordinary rigor and care avionics suppliers use in writing code. Existing safety systems are effectively impenetrable from the outside, he said, because of \u201cencryption, security keys and end-to-end verification\u201d of users already embedded in the software. Flight-control applications are separated from cabin-entertainment data with a physical gap between their respective power grids. In the event a warning comes to the cockpit, he maintained, aviators aren\u2019t cybersecurity experts so \u201cwhat could the pilots do about it anyway?\u201dThese different assessments of the industry\u2019s cyber vulnerabilities\u2014and what leaders should do combat future attacks\u2014partly reflects the uncertain nature of threats. Industry officials agree there hasn\u2019t been a single verified instance of safety systems being breached on a large commercial jetliner. But at the same time, experts\u2019 warnings are getting louder about the dangers of hackers finding a vulnerability in aviation protections.Raytheon, which over the past decade has bulked up its cybersecurity business to more than $1 billion a year in revenue, hopes to start designing what could be a cyber warning system intended for cockpits in both commercial jets and military aircraft. The challenge is \u201chow do you remediate existing systems and build in that resiliency going forward,\u201d according to       David Wajsgras,        president of the company\u2019s intelligence, information and services unit.Raytheon, a major global provider of air-traffic control hardware and applications, is starting with the more modest goal of establishing a detection system intended to identify false or spoofed sensor readings from engines, flight computers or other operating elements. But ultimately, it envisions sending some type of automated message to warn pilots if their aircraft is believed to be under cyberattack, an option that doesn\u2019t exist for any airliner at present.Compared with Thales, Raytheon is earlier in the process of analyzing the technical challenges, and it hasn\u2019t identified or signed an aircraft operator or maintenance organization to serve as a partner for field testing.Warning systems could also be used for other purposes. Under some scenarios, air carriers want the option of quickly being able to turn off all in-flight entertainment data to a specific seat, row or even the entire cabin.Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 03:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/aviation-industry-seeks-to-strengthen-cybersecurity-defenses-1498104452", "news_title": "Aviation Industry Seeks to Strengthen Cybersecurity Defenses ", "keywords": "aviation cyberthreats,aviation hacking ,aviation industry cyberthreats ,faa ,federal aviation administration ,real-time warnings to pilots about possible hacking attempts,Honeywell International,HON,Boeing,BA,Airbus SE,AIR.FR,FR:AIR,Raytheon,RTN,Rockwell Collins,COL,Thales,HO.FR,FR:HO,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,legal action,cybercrime,hacking,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,aerospace products,parts,civil aircraft,aerospace,defense,aircraft electronics,computing,defense equipment,products,industrial electronics,industrial goods,security,privacy software,technology"}, {"content": "SHANGHAI--China\u2019s Dalian Wanda Group Co., the real-estate giant owned by billionaire       Wang Jianlin,        dismissed online speculation that lenders had issued a notice to unload bonds tied to the conglomerate, which apparently sparked a drop in its units\u2019 stock and bond prices Thursday.Shares of Shenzhen-listed             Wanda Film                   Holding Co., the group\u2019s entertainment arm, fell as much as 9.8% in late-morning trading, while the price of a property subsidiary\u2019s five-year bond dropped 2.5%.

If it expires, the city would return to one central board, plus several local school boards, and the mayor would lose the power to pick the chancellor. The mayoral-control system has been in place in New York City since 2002.Critics of the old system said it was inefficient and rife with patronage, but its defenders have said the local boards gave parents a more direct voice in their children\u2019s educations.Both the Senate Republicans and Assembly Democrats expressed support for mayoral control, but the Senate had also questioned Mr. de Blasio\u2019s leadership and pushed for an expansion of charter schools.The Assembly Democrats, who are allied with Mr. de Blasio, didn\u2019t want to attach mayoral control to charter-school expansion, which they generally oppose. But they did seek to attach mayoral control to a renewal of a higher sales-tax rate. The Senate Republicans support the sales-tax reauthorization, which affects many of their districts.Because of the stalemate, both mayoral control and the reauthorization of those county sales taxes remain an open question, which could cause upheaval.At 1 a.m. Thursday, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s spokesman, Eric Phillips, urged lawmakers to continue negotiating. \u201cThere\u2019s time left to get this deal done for the 1.1 million New York City kids relying on our state government to protect the progress we\u2019ve made in our classrooms,\u201d Mr. Phillips said.But there is no indication that legislators will return to resolve those issues in a special session. The legislature is otherwise adjourned until 2018. Mayoral control and the higher sales tax will have lapsed by then.\u201cIt is unconscionable that the Senate departed, leaving our local governments with so much uncertainty,\u201d Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat, said early Thursday morning. \u201cWhether it is a fiscal decision to extend a local tax or allowing localities to make decisions about their own school districts, we have always put the needs of our constituents at home ahead of political interests in Albany.\u201dSen. John Flanagan, a Republican and the majority leader, blamed Assembly Democrats. \u201cThe Assembly needlessly tied renewal of mayoral control to dozens of\u00a0unrelated local tax extenders requested by counties to fund important\u00a0services for their residents,\u201d he said. \"I will continue to work to extend mayoral control because I believe very\u00a0strongly in the accountability it provides, but I also believe that the 50,000 boys and girls in Harlem, Brooklyn and the Bronx who are now on waiting lists for a seat inside a charter school deserve the best possible education we can provide.\"Gov.       Andrew Cuomo,        a Democrat, has said he supports renewing the sales-tax law and mayoral control, and expanding charters. He has pointed to the legislature\u2019s past bipartisan cooperation as evidence of an orderly state government on his watch, and the stalemate could be a blow to that reputation.

Mr. Warsh is seen as a possible candidate for chairman if Mr. Trump were to decide not to keep Ms. Yellen for a second, four-year term.Mr. Warsh has often been critical of the Fed in recent years, calling for broad changes such as how Fed board members communicate with each other as well as the public.He continued to take respectful jabs at the Fed during the Wednesday evening event, which was moderated by Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President       Robert Kaplan,        a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee.Mr. Kaplan said that while he disagrees with some of Mr. Warsh\u2019s comments and criticism, he also thought such disagreement and debate was helpful in strengthening the Fed.Mr. Warsh also hinted that the Fed could eventually be at risk of being dismantled if it doesn\u2019t make needed changes from within. He reminded the audience that the Fed is the nation\u2019s \u201cthird experiment with a central bank, and the reason it\u2019s our third is because the first two didn\u2019t go so well.\u201d\u201cThe idea that we [the Fed] are a permanent fixture in the economy is mistaken,\u201d Mr. Warsh said. \u201cThe reason we need to reform ourselves is because we believe in an independent central bank subject to the oversight of Congress and the selection of the president.\u201dWrite to Dan Molinski at Dan.Molinski@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-22 00:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-fed-governor-says-central-banks-independence-is-limited-1498105519", "news_title": "Former Fed Governor Says Central Bank\u2019s Independence Is Limited", "keywords": "fed monetary independence,fed trump,fed yellen ,yellen trump,Kevin Warsh,monetary policy,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "A Senate GOP plan to pass a health-care bill next week hung in the balance as some Republican lawmakers wavered and balked at the push for a quick vote.Insurers announced major changes to their ACA offerings for next year, highlighting uncertainty in the health law\u2019s marketplaces.Saudi King Salman\u2019s leadership shake-up is aimed at supercharging efforts to secure the country\u2019s future.Democratic divisions surfaced after an expensive loss in a special election in Georgia for a House seat.Russian hackers targeted voting systems in 21 states last year, current and former U.S. officials testified.The stabbing of a police officer at the Flint, Mich., airport was being investigated as a terrorist act.Belgian officials said the slain bomber in a thwarted train station attack sympathized with Islamic State.Queen Elizabeth II, in a speech to the U.K. parliament, unveiled the Conservative government\u2019s agenda.The Wall Street Journal fired a veteran foreign-affairs reporter for violating the paper\u2019s ethical standards.An ex-Milwaukee policeman was acquitted in a fatal shooting that sparked riots.Islamic State destroyed a historic Mosul mosque, Iraq\u2019s military said.Tropical storm Cindy began lashing the U.S. Gulf Coast with heavy rains.Appeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-22 00:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-news-world-wide-1498104128", "news_title": "What\u2019s News: World-Wide", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,page-one stories,news digests"}, {"content": "In a city that is relentlessly shifting, here\u2019s one constant: The Hispanic population is on the rise.That\u2019s according to new U.S. Census Bureau population estimates released\u00a0Thursday.The Bronx had the greatest growth in Hispanics among the five boroughs. Hispanics made up 56% of Bronx residents on July 1, 2016, compared with 53.6% on July 1, 2010.In all, Hispanics make up 29% of the city\u2019s population of slightly more than 8 million, according to the new 2016 data.The growing number of Hispanics in the Bronx is a long-term trend dating back decades and attributed, in part, to an increase in the Dominican population through ongoing immigration and a rising birthrate, according to Laird W. Bergad, director of the Center for Latin American, Caribbean and Latino Studies, a research institute at the Graduate Center, City University of New York.Dominicans are the city\u2019s largest Latino nationality.\u201cSome 10-to-15,000 Dominicans are arriving each year from the island and if you add that onto natural reproduction and fairly significant birthrates, we\u2019re getting a growth of the Dominican population in the city,\u201d       Mr. Bergad       said.The epicenter of Dominican settlement in the northern Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights substantially has shifted to the Bronx, he noted. \u201cThe Bronx calls because it is a lower cost of living area,\u201d he said.The strong sense of Dominican identity is one thing that makes       Dalia Peguero,        36 years old, feel comfortable in her new home. She moved from the Dominican Republic to the Bronx 8 months ago to reunite with her husband.On Wednesday, she was one of 10 Dominican students in a 12-person English-as-a-second-language class at the Bronxworks offices on the Grand Concourse.\u201cYou feel like family,\u201d Ms. Peguero said of living in the Bronx. \u201cThey speak the same language. The only difference is the weather.\u201dMs. Peguero said she finds nearly everything she would get in the Dominican Republic in the Bronx\u2014especially food. Even New York weather appeals to her, which is why she doesn\u2019t see herself moving soon.\u201cThere are many opportunities to grow here,\u201d she said.The census data also looked at age.The median age in New York state went from 38 years in 2010 to 38.5 on July 1, 2016, according to the data. Sumter County, Fla., west of Orlando, Fla., had the highest median age of any U.S. county at 67.1 years.Nationally, all race and ethnic groups grew during the year ending July 1, 2016, with the Hispanic population nationwide increasing by 2%.Census demographers noted that New York had the largest black or African-American population of any U.S. state in 2016, with 3.8 million people.", "news_time": "2017-06-22 00:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nycs-hispanic-population-is-growing-1498104060", "news_title": "NYC\u2019s Hispanic Population Is Growing ", "keywords": "census,demographics,new york's hispanic population,Dalia Peguero,political,general news,society,community"}]
