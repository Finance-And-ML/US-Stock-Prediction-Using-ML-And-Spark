The pope declined to renew the cardinal\u2019s five-year term, which ended Saturday.Although Cardinal M\u00fcller is only 69 years old, far from the mandatory retirement age of 80 for cardinals, Saturday\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t indicate that he would receive a new assignment.Cardinal M\u00fcller, a conservative German prelate appointed to head the congregation by       Pope Benedict XVI,        has been conspicuously out of step with the pope\u2019s liberalizing push, particularly on the issue of divorce. Pope Francis has replaced him with Archbishop       Luis Ladaria Ferrer,        73, opting for a low-profile theologian with a record of doctrinal orthodoxy but little history of engagement in public debates.Cardinal Muller\u2019s exit reflects the dwindling power of the congregation, a Vatican office that loomed especially large under John Paul II and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who served as its chief for almost 24 years before becoming Pope Benedict. For two and a half decades, amid controversy over the modernizing changes introduced by the Second Vatican Council, the congregation issued a series of documents reaffirming traditional church teaching on topics including sexual and medical ethics, liberation theology and the church\u2019s relations with other faiths.Under Pope Francis\u2014who has taken a highly informal approach to doctrine\u2014the congregation\u2019s teaching role has been practically neutralized; it has issued just one such document in over four years. Under previous popes, the congregation vetted all Vatican documents of any significance to ensure they were doctrinally sound. But under Pope Francis, the congregation\u2019s suggested emendations to some of the pope\u2019s most significant writings, including a major statement on divorce, have been ignored. The pope has also personally fired a number of congregation staff members against the wishes of Cardinal M\u00fcller.Lacking influence within the Vatican, Cardinal M\u00fcller has made public statements increasingly at variance with Pope Francis, particularly with regard to the pontiff\u2019s 2016 document Amoris Laetitia, in which he encouraged priests to show leniency toward divorced Catholics who remarry without an annulment of their first marriage.In May, for example, Cardinal M\u00fcller contradicted the pope when he told EWTN Catholic television that the document didn\u2019t open Communion to remarried divorced people. He also said the church wouldn\u2019t ordain women as deacons, even though the pope had named a commission to look into the question.Meanwhile, Cardinal M\u00fcller has been touched by criticism of the Vatican\u2019s handling of clerical sex-abuse cases. A member of a papal advisory commission on anti-abuse policies accused the doctrinal office, whose disciplinary section deals with priests accused of abuse, of blocking the establishment of a special court to judge bishops who mishandle abuse cases. The cardinal said several Vatican offices had agreed the special court wasn\u2019t necessary.In Archbishop Ladaria, the pontiff has chosen a self-described moderate who has served as the congregation\u2019s No. 2 official since 2008. Some observers had predicted Pope Francis would name Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of Manila or Argentine Archbishop V\u00edctor Fern\u00e1ndez, a major contributor to papal documents including Amoris Laetitia. But a prominent liberal prelate would have stoked the conservative opposition that has risen steadily during the current pontificate.By naming a non-cardinal, Pope Francis, who has often circumvented the Vatican bureaucracy to advance his agenda, has further diminished the clout of the doctrinal office in the highly rank-conscious Vatican.Saturday\u2019s shake-up is the latest in a series of high-level personnel news at the Holy See. Earlier this week, Cardinal       George Pell,        the Vatican\u2019s finance chief, took a leave of absence to return to Australia to defend himself against charges of child sex abuse. Last month, the Vatican\u2019s auditor general, Libero Milone, abruptly resigned without explanation several years before the end of his term.Write to Francis X.

Two were in critical condition as of Saturday afternoon, and the remainder suffered wounds that weren\u2019t life-threatening, he said.The shooting occurred about 2:30 a.m. Saturday at the Power Ultra Lounge in downtown Little Rock, about a mile east of the State Capitol, Chief Buckner said. \u201cSome sort of dispute ensued in the audience\u201d with \u201cmultiple individuals responsible for those shots fired,\u201d he said.Video posted on             Facebook                   from someone who appeared to attend the concert captured the mayhem\u2014the sound of series of gunshots and patrons\u2019 screams.Police were exploring the possibility that the incident was gang-related or connected to a string of recent shootings in Little Rock, Chief Buckner said. Police hadn\u2019t yet made any arrests, and it was too early in the investigation to identify potential suspects, he said.A Facebook page for the nightclub featured a flier that promoted a Friday night performance by Memphis rap artist Finese 2Tymes. The image showed what appeared to be the entertainer staring down the barrel of a gun\u2014something the Mr. Stodola noted at the news conference and criticized.Chief Buckner said off-duty police officers were working in the parking lot between 11 p.m. Friday and 2 a.m. Saturday. He said during that time, some people who were with the rap performer attempted to enter the club, one of whom was openly carrying a weapon. Officers sought to stop the person, but he and others apparently entered through an alternate entrance, Chief Buckner said.A posting Saturday on what appears to be Finese 2Tymes\u2019s Facebook page read, \u201cPrayers go to the innocent people and there family that came out to support me, last night in Little Rock Ark. The violence is not for the club people. We all come with 1 motive at the end of the day, and thats to have fun.\u201dAt the news conference, Mr. Stodola said the Arkansas Alcohol Beverage Control Board was suspending the club\u2019s liquor license.

The new acts are different from their predecessors: They are multi-ethnic and tackle thorny subjects with a centrist voice. Rather than hiding their accents, they take pride in their Southernness and flaunt it. Musically, they\u2019ve splintered into a variety of styles, from retro-soul and revved-up Lynyrd Skynyrd-esque rock to punk.\u201cSouthern rock has gone from being music made by white guys with accents like mine to being this multicultural thing that crosses so many genres,\u201d says Chuck Reece, editor-in-chief of the Bitter Southerner, a Southern music and culture magazine whose digital audience has grown to more than 100,000 monthly viewers since its launch in 2013.The South has long been a wellspring of American popular music, from New Orleans jazz to Memphis rock and roll to Atlanta rap. The latest rock revival shows how dramatically this region\u2019s demographic and economic landscape is changing. In the past decade, the South has seen more growth in Hispanics, Asians and mixed-race Americans than any region, says William Frey, a Brookings Institution demographer. There\u2019s also been an infusion of young people from New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and rural parts of the Midwest into Southern cities, drawn by a strong regional economy and lower living costs. This \u201cblend of lifestyles, backgrounds and origins will keep the region on the cutting edge of cultural change,\u201d Mr. Frey says.Among notable Southern acts are Lee Bains III and the Glory Fires of Birmingham, Ala.; Bitter, a punk band with two transgender members and a Latina lead singer; and Alabama Shakes, led by powerhouse Brittany Howard, who is biracial.The popularity of homegrown Southern acts has fueled a broad expansion in the live-music scene. In 2015, The Bowery Presents, a New York-based concert promoter, partnered with musician-entrepreneur Brian Teasley to open Birmingham\u2019s 500-capacity club Saturn. The new venue is a step up from Mr. Teasley\u2019s earlier 250-capacity room, Bottletree. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how much the demand for great music has grown here in the last 10 years,\u201d Mr. Teasley says.Bigger bands like TV on the Radio \u201cdidn\u2019t come here in anywhere near the frequency that they do now,\u201d Mr. Teasley says. Meanwhile, Birmingham\u2019s music-business infrastructure has grown\u2014more bands, labels, blogs, record stores and venues, such as the 1,300-capacity Iron City, he says.Louisville, Ky., has also seen expansion. Zanzabar, a favorite local venue, recently doubled its capacity and now accommodates nearly 400 people. Co-owner Jon Wettig says he hopes an apartment the venue owns next door will entice more bands to come through.In Nashville,             Live Nation,       the country\u2019s biggest concert promoter, has been bulking up. It now runs the city\u2019s Ascend Amphitheater and       Carl Black       Chevy Woods Amphitheater. Rival AEG Presents is planning to open two new music establishments\u2014a 4,000-capacity venue and a 600-capacity one\u2014in downtown Nashville as part of a new entertainment district.Jordan Smith, 28 years old, founder of Nashville group Diarrhea Planet, moved there from central Indiana in 2007. His band has four lead guitarists\u2014evoking the signature multiple guitars of Skynyrd, yet also sounding, at times, like Van Halen. Initially, Diarrhea Planet had difficulty getting gigs because Nashville bookers deemed its members transplants, Mr. Smith says. (Their name\u2014they were a joke band at first\u2014didn\u2019t help.) Now, Nashville\u2019s scene boasts bands from a dizzying array of rock subgenres, Mr. Smith says.What unites the new crop of bands is their inclusive definition of Southernness. \u201cThe whole sweep of changes from the first era of Southern rock to where we are now has a lot to do with the younger generation becoming more comfortable living in diverse environments,\u201d Bitter Southerner\u2019s Mr. Reece says. Atlanta\u2019s Bitter, which formed a year ago, sometimes sings in Spanish; its Houston-born singer and songwriter Maritza Nu\u00f1ez, 21, a first-generation Mexican-American, loves Shakira and Courtney Love. Asked about \u201cSouthern rock,\u201d which typically evokes older white bands, drummer Zo Chapman says: \u201cWe\u2019re rock, and we\u2019re from the South\u2026 You better put our picture in the dictionary.\u201dPerhaps the region\u2019s biggest breakout group is Alabama Shakes, based in Athens, Ala., who won Grammy awards in 2016 for Best Rock Performance and Best Alternative Music Album. The band has racked up nearly 1.7 million in album units, including sales and streams, says Nielsen Music. Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit, another thriving act, debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard chart last month with their new album, \u201cThe Nashville Sound.\u201dArmed with social media, even isolated Southern bands can build fan bases. Riley Gale, the 31-year-old frontman of Dallas punk-metal band Power Trip, says touring is expensive for \u201cland-locked\u201d Texas bands since it takes nine hours just to drive west from Dallas to El Paso. Streaming services and social-media postings help bands get attention and pack shows. \u201cThe signal has been boosted,\u201d he says.The Glory Fires, who fuse classic-rock, punk and soul, released their third album on Friday. Frontman Lee Bains III, 32, an English-literature major who wears a baseball cap and holds a construction job, says his first concert was seeing the Allman Brothers Band. Yet he calls Atlanta rap duo OutKast his Beatles. \u201cThe South doesn\u2019t sound one way,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a multitude.\u201d On \u201cWhitewash,\u201d a new song, he rejects white privilege, saying he doesn\u2019t want \u201cpower over anybody.\u201dThe Glory Fires are the latest in a line of unashamedly Southern rockers. Lynyrd Skynyrd wrote \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d in response to Neil Young\u2019s criticisms of the region. Drive-By Truckers, who revived Southern rock in the 2000s, took pride in Southerness but also challenged the region\u2019s troubled history. On \u201cThe Weeds Downtown,\u201d from the Glory Fires\u2019 2014 album, \u201cDereconstructed,\u201d Mr. Bains tries to convince his now-wife to move back to Birmingham: \u201cI know that Birmingham gets you down / But look what it raised you up to be.\u201dSeventies acts like the Charlie Daniels Band defended the South at a time when it was poor, largely rural and frequently disdained in other parts of the country. By the time pop, hair metal and hip-hop dominated in the 1980s and early 1990s, Southern accents had become a career obstacle. \u201cEverybody was trying to run from their Southerness,\u201d says Mike Cooley, co-leader of Drive-By Truckers.Today\u2019s bands \u201cspeak loud and proud with their accents,\u201d Mr. Cooley says. Being Southern has been an asset for Birmingham\u2019s St. Paul and the Broken Bones. Just three years after forming in 2012, the soul-rock group, popular in the U.S. and Europe and fronted by the energetic, bespectacled singer Paul Janeway, opened up for the Rolling Stones.When the band first started, fellow musicians and fans questioned how they succeeded being from a small Southern city like Birmingham, Mr. Janeway says. \u201cNow it\u2019s like, \u2018Y\u2019all from Alabama!\u2019 \u201d He laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of beautiful.\u201d\u200bWrite to Neil Shah at neil.shah@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-01 17:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-souths-rock-renaissance-1498858779", "news_title": "The South\u2019s Rock Renaissance", "keywords": "alabama shake,allman brothers,beatles,bitter,charlie daniels band,lee bains iii and the glory fires,lynard skynyrd,outkast,southern music,southern rock,st. paul and the broken bones,the glory fires,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music"}, {"content": "Illinois lawmakers continued to work on a budget compromise on Saturday, the first day of its third fiscal year without a balanced spending plan.During its record-breaking fiscal impasse, the state has racked up $14.6 billion in unpaid bills, and bond houses are warning the state\u2019s credit rating could be downgraded to junk status.A federal judge Friday found Illinois non-compliant with its Medicaid payments, ruling the state must pay $293 million a month and $1 billion over the next year to help mitigate the $3 billion it owes to health-care providers.The logjam is the result of a political standoff between Republican Gov.       Bruce Rauner,        elected in 2015, and Democratic House Speaker       Michael Madigan,        a Chicago Democrat who has held the office for more than three decades.Gov. Rauner called a 10-day special session to solve the budget crisis before the start of the fiscal year on July 1. But the governor and lawmakers were unable to broker a deal before midnight Friday, leaving the General Assembly working overtime.Mr. Madigan said Saturday on the House floor that members will convene again Sunday, but no budget bills will be called before Monday. He said chief negotiators for state appropriations, revenue and workers\u2019 compensation issues will work through the weekend.The announcement drew a rebuke from House Minority Leader       Jim Durkin,        who rallied his Republican colleagues Friday in support of a Democratic spending plan backed by Mr. Madigan.\u201cWe had great momentum yesterday in this chamber,\u201d Mr. Durkin said on the House floor. \u201cSaying that we\u2019re done today, come back tomorrow\u2026to me, it speaks for itself.\u201d\u201cYou know because you\u2019re part of the negotiations that there will be no bills to call tomorrow. You know that,\u201d Mr. Madigan replied.Mr. Durkin\u2019s remarks prompted a standing ovation from House Republicans and many Democrats. As Mr. Madigan exited the chamber, one lawmaker shouted, \u201cSpeaker Junk!\u201dThe outburst was an apparent reference to a digital ad from the Illinois Republican Party that identified the speaker as \u201cJunk Madigan\u201d because of the state\u2019s credit-downgrade risk. The party pulled the ad Friday after a House compromise vote in support of Democratic Rep.       Greg Harris\u2019s       $36.5 billion spending plan, which includes a 5% cut to government agency funding. Mr. Harris is one of Mr. Madigan\u2019s top lieutenants in budget negotiations.The tense House floor action marked a departure from cordial proceedings the day before, when Mr. Durkin said, \u201cWe are so close I can taste it.\u201d That public optimism has since dissipated.Also Saturday, the legislature voted to override the governor\u2019s veto of telephone fee increases included in a bill to fund emergency call centers.The measure increased the monthly 911 telephone surcharge to $5 from $3.90 in Chicago and hiked the rate to $1.50 from 87 cents across the rest of the state. Gov. Rauner struck the fee increases from the bill.\u201cThis override is a signal of what we should be doing next, which is voting on a fully funded budget for the state of Illinois,\u201d said Democratic Rep.

The trade body\u2019s leader,       Alexandre de Juniac,        said last week that the \u201caggressive implementation timeline will\u2026be challenging.\u201dHomeland Security Secretary John Kelly has warned for months that terrorists are aiming to take down a plane with explosives hidden in a laptop. In March, he banned personal electronic devices in the cabins of planes flying to the U.S. from 10 airports in the Middle East and North Africa. That prohibition could be lifted if those airports and airlines meet the new edicts.Mr. Kelly later suggested widening the ban as drastically as to cover all foreign flights in and out of the U.S. After consulting airlines and foreign aviation officials, he settled on the mandates laid out on Wednesday, which affect about 325,000 passengers a day flying from airports in 105 nations.A DHS official declined to confirm the timeline laid out in the IATA memo, saying that doing so could compromise aviation security. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to tell our adversaries what we\u2019re doing,\u201d the official said.The official confirmed that DHS intends to work with airlines that may not be able to install the machines promptly. Interim steps could shore up security while airlines works toward compliance, the official said. Carriers that don\u2019t comply or agree to a plan to do so could face fines, a ban on laptops in the cabin and the cargo hold, or a ban on flying to the U.S., the official added.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be reasonable with them,\u201d he said.The global airports trade group couldn\u2019t be immediately reached for comment, nor could the leading Asian airline trade association.The DHS official said many of the affected airports already have the scanners, which measure for traces of explosives by analyzing a swab taken from a flier\u2019s luggage or hand. Such machines also are used to check for narcotics. Manufacturers say the test takes about 30 seconds and that the machines cost between $25,000 and $50,000.The DHS required U.S. airports and airlines to use the scanners in 2010. The European Union mandated them in 2014, but allowed the industry more than a year to comply. Some Asian nations also are widely using the technology, said Norbert Kloepper, chief of the explosive-trace detection unit of             Bruker Corp.      , the smallest of the four global manufacturers of the machines.Mr. Kloepper estimated 3,000 to 5,000 new machines will be needed to meet the DHS rules.

He had an assault rifle, according to police.The hospital website listed Henry Bello as a doctor of family medicine, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Mr. Bello was a doctor, pharmacy technician or physician assistant, according to public records.The shooting \u201cwas an isolated incident,\u201d said New York City Mayor       Bill de Blasio,        describing it as \u201ca workplace-related matter.\u201dMr. Bello was threatened with termination at the hospital in 2015 for alleged sexual misconduct, according to a senior law-enforcement official. He then resigned. The official said Mr. Bello was also staying at a men\u2019s shelter in Manhattan earlier this year.One of the victims is in critical condition while four have serious injuries, according to police. One person was shot in the leg. Mr. de Blasio identified several victims as doctors, and said they are \u201cfighting for their lives right now.\u201dThe horror unfolded around 3 p.m. on the 16th and 17th floor of the private, nonprofit teaching hospital in the Grand Concourse section of the Bronx.Mr. Bello walked to the 16th floor, the official said, and asked for a specific doctor by name. That doctor wasn\u2019t present, prompting Mr. Bello to open fire on the 16th floor. People on the floor began to scatter, the official said.Mr. Bello then went to the 17th floor, where he fatally shot the doctor, according to the official.New York police officials identified the doctor as Tracy Sin-Yee Tam, 32 years old.Mr. Bello armed with a AR-15 semiautomatic rifle then tried to set himself on fire, prompting the fire-alarm system to go off. He then shot himself, the official said.Police responded in force almost immediately, with officers clearing the hospital room by room, the official said.Around that time,       Lewis Jefferson,        who is with the hospital\u2019s housekeeping department, was on the 12th floor, when he heard codes going out on hospital radios. Police officers rushed in shouting for people to leave the building, creating a hectic scene.\u201cPeople getting shot in the hospital is bad,\u201d Mr. Jefferson said. \u201cYou come to work and [you\u2019re] thinking you\u2019re not coming home. It\u2019s very scary.\u201dAntoine Jernigan,        37, a construction worker who lives in the Bronx, said he was waiting for a doctor\u2019s appointment on the seventh floor when he heard a call over the loudspeaker asking for a doctor to come to the 16th floor three times. \u201cIt felt helpless not knowing what was going on,\u201d Mr. Jernigan said.Sylvia Correa,        52, said police ushered those in the seventh floor waiting room into locked rooms as they searched for the shooter. She said they were kept inside the room for a very nerve-racking hour.\u201cI was thinking, \u2018Is he coming on this floor shooting people,\u2019\u201dMs. Correa said. \u201cWhat you see on TV is different. This is real. It\u2019s real.\u201dRobert Maldonado,        an emergency medical technician, was at the hospital when he and his team heard about the shooting. They rushed to the ninth floor where they treated a person who Mr. Maldonado said was shot in the abdomen.He said the hospital\u2019s elevators weren\u2019t working, and the group of EMTs\u2014with the help of police officers\u2014carried the patient down to the hospital\u2019s emergency floor where he was treated for injuries. The patient, according to Mr. Maldonado, was wearing a white lab coat and was conscious, in a lot of pain, and not speaking.Meanwhile, police found the shooter on the 17th floor, where the other victim was found dead. The shooter had attempted to set himself on fire, which activated the hospital\u2019s alarm, according to New York Police Department Commissioner       James O\u2019Neill.Multiple calls to the hospital\u2019s spokesperson weren\u2019t immediately returned.The news of Mr. Bello\u2019s role in the fatal shooting came as a surprise to some who knew him. Attorney       David Wims       represented Mr. Bello in 2014 in an unemployment case involving Mr. Bello\u2019s work at Metropolitan Hospital Center as a pharmacy technician in 2012 for 10 months, according to Mr. Wims.Mr. Wims said Mr. Bello told him at the time that he was trained to practice medicine in West Africa, though he couldn\u2019t remember which country, and said he was in the process of becoming licensed to practice medicine in New York.\u201cI thought highly of him,\u201d said Mr. Wims, \u201cand he seemed like he was full of energy.\u201d\u2014Mariana Alfaro, Joseph De Avila, Jacob Gershman and       Lisa Schwartz       contributed to this article.Write to Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.com, Melanie Grayce West at melanie.west@wsj.com and Keiko Morris at Keiko.Morris@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-01 15:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-people-shot-in-bronx-hospital-1498852193", "news_title": "Police Say Former Bronx Hospital Employee Shot Seven People; One Dies ", "keywords": "bronx, bronx hospital shooting,bronx-lebanon,grand concourse, henry bello,hospital , hospital shooting,shooting,Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center,Henry Bello,political,general news,crime,legal action,rampage,serial killings,murder,manslaughter,health care,life sciences,hospital care,healthcare provision"}, {"content": "Governors in New Jersey and Maine shut down state government after lawmakers in their states failed to reach budget deals before Friday\u2019s midnight deadline.Republican New Jersey Gov.       Chris Christie,        who is in his final year of two terms running the state, called the Democratic-led legislature back to Trenton for a special session on Saturday. In Maine, Republican Gov.       Paul LePage       put in place a partial shutdown until Monday afternoon.\u201cThis is embarrassing and it\u2019s pointless,\u201d Mr. Christie said at a Saturday news conference in Trenton. \u201cOur residents do not have access to a myriad of services that they deserve.\u201dUnder the New Jersey shutdown, only essential state employees such as state police, prison workers, and hospital employees will report to work, according to a statement from the governor\u2019s office. The lottery, casinos and racetracks will remain open and road construction work will also continue.Mr. Christie said federal funding would pay for some essential services during the government shutdown, and for others, \u201cwe\u2019ll run up a tab. I can\u2019t stop the state police from operating.\u201dState beaches and parks were closed, including Liberty State Park, which overlooks New York City and is scheduled to host more than 100,000 people for its annual Fourth of July celebration and fireworks display on Tuesday. Island Beach State Park in Ocean County was also closed Saturday.The states are among 46 that start a new fiscal year on Saturday and nearly a dozen where budget negotiations had come down to the wire. Some states routinely wait until the 11th hour or later to agree on a budget, and several missed the deadline this year including Connecticut.Other states locked in debate include Illinois, which hasn\u2019t had a budget in two years and has faced a risk of a ratings downgrade to junk status. Officials there took a promising step forward to resolve the standoff on Friday, with the House of Representatives voting to support a Democratic spending plan largely viewed as a compromise measure. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if the ratings firms would allow more time to work on a resolution.In Maine, \u00a0Gov. LePage ordered the state\u2019s first \u00a0shutdown since 1991, after lawmakers failed to strike a deal on new taxes and education funding.\u201cThe Maine people are taxed enough,\u201d Gov. LePage said in a statement. \u201cI will not tax them anymore and in my budget overall taxes were decreased. Maine has plenty of revenue to fund state government without raising taxes.\u201dEssential services in the state remain in place as will a host of others including some state parks, unemployment benefits and child welfare.Connecticut Gov.       Dannel Malloy,        a Democrat, on Friday signed an executive order to keep the state government running after the Legislature failed to approve a budget plan to close a two-year deficit of $5.1 billion.Mr. Malloy\u2019s executive order, which went into effect at midnight, triggered deep spending cuts for the state and would amount to a $2.1 billion reduction for the entire fiscal year. The plan slashes education funding, eliminates summer youth-employment programs and cuts rental-assistance programs.In New Jersey, cities and businesses braced for disruptions over the holiday weekend.\u201cThere\u2019s an economic impact for real,\u201d Jersey City Mayor       Steve Fulop       said Friday before the shutdown, adding that the city and local businesses have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the event.Statue Cruises, which runs ferry trips to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty from Liberty State Park, said it would honor tickets at its Manhattan location or exchange them for later dates.A four-day shutdown would impact more than 25,000 expected visitors and cost at least $850,000 in lost revenue to the company and related entities, a Statue Cruises executive said in a statement.Mr. Christie said he would sign the budget sent to him by Democrats, which includes more than $300 million in additional spending for education and other services, but only if lawmakers passed a bill giving the state more control over its largest insurer. The insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, has strongly opposed the legislation.Assembly Speaker       Vincent Prieto,        a Democrat, has refused to put the legislation demanded by Mr. Christie up for a vote, calling it an unfair intervention in the not-for-profit company that shouldn\u2019t be part of the budget process.\u2014Kate Linebaugh contributed to this article.Write to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-01 13:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-jersey-maine-shut-down-government-amid-budget-impasses-1498908538", "news_title": "New Jersey, Maine Shut Down Governments Amid Budget Impasses ", "keywords": " beaches, budget, budget impasses, budget negotiations, deadline,downgrade, essential workers, government shutdown,jersey city, lawmakers,liberty state park, maine,new jersey,parks,taxes,Chris Christie,Paul LePage,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics"}, {"content": "Fears of sluggish Chinese economic growth and the end of supply disruptions loom over the copper market, threatening to take 10% or more off prices in the coming months, analysts say.The base metal\u2019s price is up more than 7% so far this year, pushed higher by optimism surrounding President       Donald Trump\u2019s       promises of infrastructure spending and a stimulus-driven uptick in the Chinese economy in late 2016.Now, though, with investors increasingly fearful of a Chinese economic slowdown and Mr. Trump\u2019s investment pledges looking increasingly unlikely to bear fruit, those purchases look \u201cover-exuberant,\u201d according to       Caroline Bain,        chief commodities economist at Capital Economics.\u201cWe expect several of the recent drivers of industrial metals\u2014especially stronger economic growth in China\u2014to slow going into the second half of the year,\u201d       Seth Rosenfeld,        senior research analyst at Jefferies said.A \u201crelatively benign outlook suggests there will be little to bolster prices over the course of this year, as optimism about [industrial metals] demand continues to fade,\u201d said Capital Economics\u2019s Ms. Bain in a note, adding that prices could slip as low as $5,200 a metric ton by the end of the year. London Metal Exchange three-month copper contracts were last priced Friday at $5,937 a metric ton.China\u2019s desire to rein in public credit growth could hamper industrial metals demand from its property and infrastructure sectors, underpinning a slowdown in broader demand. On top of this,\u00a0Chinese auto sales growth is expected to fall to 3%, down from 13.7% last year, putting more pressure on metals demand,             J.P. Morgan                   said.The world\u2019s biggest copper customer has seen demand growth slow for some time now.\u201cChina\u2019s copper demand growth is no longer 5-10%, it\u2019s now 3%, and in the past year or so, it\u2019s struggled to get to 2%,\u201d said       Tom Price,        a commodities analyst at             Morgan Stanley.In the medium term, a Chinese slowdown would push copper prices toward $5,000 a metric ton, J.P. Morgan said in a note.Those forecasts of a drop in prices might have come sooner in the year if copper had not found support from supply-side problems. Prices were bolstered in the first months of 2017 by disruptions at the world\u2019s two largest copper mines\u2014            BHP Billiton\u2019s       Chilean Escondida operation and             Freeport McMoRan\u2019s       mine at Grasberg in Indonesia.\u201cThose supply disruptions kept prices higher than we had initially thought,\u201d said       Carsten Menke,        a commodity research analyst at             Julius Baer.The effects of those supply interferences are now played out. \u201cThe first quarter was a world of pain for copper, but now we\u2019ve seen supply normalize. Plus, trade tends to be weaker in the second half of the year than in the first half anyway,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Mr. Price said.With China\u2019s ruling Communist Party due to hold its 19th National Congress and switch its current Politburo committee in October, demand growth for the broad industrial metals complex will likely be under close scrutiny, particularly when held against increasingly tough comparatives, Jefferies\u2019s Mr. Rosenfeld said.\u201cWhile there is a limited risk of the economy sharply slowing through the party congress, strong demand growth in the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017, will see relative growth slow,\u201d Mr. Rosenfeld added.Write to David Hodari at David.Hodari@dowjones.com", "news_time": "2017-07-01 12:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/copper-prices-at-risk-for-a-fall-1498908625", "news_title": "Copper Prices at Risk for a Fall", "keywords": "2q market report,2q markets report,china economy,china slowdown,copper prices,infrastructure spending,metals prices,quarterly report,u.s. infrastructure,economic news,commodity markets,metals markets,commodity,financial market news,copper markets,non-ferrous metals markets,metal ore mining,copper ore,nickel ore mining,basic materials,resources,mining,quarrying"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014The European Union and Japan were nearing a trade deal, the two sides said over the weekend, but there were still gaps to overcome as two of the U.S.\u2019 biggest economic competitors look to bolster international commerce.Trade talks between the EU and Japan have been ongoing since 2013 but discord over issues like Japanese auto exports and European agricultural sales to Japan has slowed progress. Negotiations have accelerated in recent months, as both sides have reacted to the Trump administration\u2019s retreat from international trade deals.Japanese Foreign Minister       Fumio Kishida       said Saturday the framework of an agreement was within reach, adding he was willing to go to Brussels to complete a deal before Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe       travels to Europe for the coming Group of 20 leaders summit.\u201cWe made meaningful progress, but both sides still have important points that need to be resolved,\u201d Mr. Kishida said after meeting the EU team.The EU\u2019s trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said she was confident of a political deal by July 6, paving the way for Mr. Abe to come to Brussels. However, she also acknowledged the need for additional talks among officials.\u201cHard work in Tokyo but a lot of progress. Some things remaining yet confident our leaders can announce political agreement at summit 6 July,\u201d she said before departing Tokyo.The EU\u2019s executive negotiates trade deals on behalf of its 28 member states. Ms. Malmstr\u00f6m will report back to capitals on the progress made.Even if a political deal is announced next Thursday, there would still be work ahead to agree a detailed text of a final agreement. The full ratification process could also take some time.With \u20ac125 billion ($134.3 billion) of exports and imports in 2016, an EU-Japan trade deal would be one of the most significant the bloc has reached.\u00a0Officials have said it could see the scrapping of an annual \u20ac1 billion worth of customs duties and propel European exports of processed food, chemicals and medical devices.A deal would represent progress for Mr. Abe\u2019s goal of securing better terms of trade for Japanese companies overseas, particularly following the decision by the U.S. to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Japan joined.Japan has for years lagged behind other developed nations in reaching trade deals, most notably South Korea, a competitor in many major industries. In 2015, Japan set a target of 70% of its international trade being covered by free-trade agreements, up from around 23% at that time.But slow progress on a deal with the EU to date also highlights some strong political opposition to reducing tariffs on imports, especially agricultural ones.Mr. Abe\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party has led calls for the government to ensure local producers of pork, wood and dairy products are able to compete against their European rivals, while also calling for the elimination of EU tariffs on items such as autos and home appliances.European officials say tariff-free access for autos is possible but have worried about the impact on local firms and expressed concerns that non-tariff barrier to EU auto exports could remain in Japan.While the EU vies to take over leadership from the U.S. in promoting open markets, pushing for deals from Japan to Mexico, European governments also face domestic backlash to a pro-trade agenda. The bloc is looking at ways to sharpen its trade defense instruments.Local opposition in Belgium\u2019s Wallonian regional parliament almost derailed a pact with Canada in late 2016.

The deal, approved by the boards of both companies, would have to be approved by shareholders and regulators\u201cThe combination of the two companies will strengthen their investment in modern, mobile technology infrastructure as well as the build out of a high speed fiber optic network,\u201d Telecom Argentina said in a statement.Telecom Argentina is owned by Fintech Advisory, a firm run by       David Mart\u00ednez,        a Mexican-born investor who already holds a 40% stake in Cablevisi\u00f3n.News of the merger comes six months ahead of Argentina\u2019s plan to allow companies here to offer quadruple play services, which have been largely prohibited in Argentina.It also comes ahead of a key midterm congressional election in October in which former President       Cristina Kirchner       will compete for a Senate seat. Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s government heavily regulated the media and telecommunications industry, passing a landmark law that put new limits on media companies, particularly             Grupo Clar\u00edn,       which holds a 60% stake in Cablevisi\u00f3n.Mrs. Kirchner portrayed Grupo Clar\u00edn as an all-too-powerful political actor that needed to be downsized to give competing media outlets greater influence. Grupo Clar\u00edn has said the Kirchner administration was trying to muzzle independent media.Media regulation is a politically charged topic in Argentina and any move by regulators to approve the merger could become political fodder during the congressional campaign. Analysts say the election will be seen as a referendum on the more market friendly policies of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s market-friendly successor,       Mauricio Macri.President Macri says Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s media policies stymied investment and favored companies that promoted her agenda. Indeed, her administration distributed a disproportionate amount of state funding to media outlets that offered her favorable coverage. Mr. Macri has moved to boost investment in the sector and is trying to woo foreign companies.The merger would provide the companies with a roughly 55% market share in broadband services, according to       Enrique Carrier,        an industry analyst. It would also pose a challenge to Claro, a unit of Mexico\u2019s             Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil SAB,       and the local unit of Spain\u2019s             Telef\u00f3nica SA      .\u201cThis implies the creation of a single company capable of offering quadruple play and it will also be a player which is strong in each of those services,\u201d Mr. Carrier said. \u201cThat would give the company a dominant position in broadband and give it an advantage over competitors such as Telef\u00f3nica, which doesn\u2019t offer television services and Claro, which doesn\u2019t have a broadband network.\"Write to Taos Turner at taos.turner@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-01 11:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/telecom-argentina-cablevision-announce-merger-1498924578", "news_title": "Telecom Argentina, Cablevisi\u00f3n Announce Merger ", "keywords": " argentina ,broadband services, cablevision,claro,cristina kirchner, grupo clarin, internet providers ,mauricio macri,media, merger,midterm elections,mobile,quadruple play services,regulators,telecom argentina,telecommunications sector, telefonica,Telecom Argentina,TEO,AR:TECO2,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,telecommunication services,wireless telecommunications services,internet service providers (discontinued from 11th july 2017),internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Wall Street\u2019s frontline regulator of stock brokerages will earn $1 million for his first full year on the job, which could put him on track to earn less than its last chief executive.Robert Cook,        who took over as CEO of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in August, will be paid $1 million in salary in 2017, but his bonus has not yet been set.

Mr. Cook earned $346,154 for his first five months on the job in 2016 and declined to take a bonus for that period, according to an annual report made public Friday.Because Mr. Cook took no bonus, his total compensation was lower than several executives who report to him.Finra posted net income of $57.7 million in 2016, according to its annual report, compared with a net loss of $29.5 million in 2015.

The term was briefly used in parts of the Morningside Heights and Manhattan Valley area, but now roughly describes the lower section of what\u2019s commonly called \u201ccentral Harlem,\u201d stretching from the top of Manhattan\u2019s Central Park to 125th Street, bordered on the west by Morningside Park and on the east by Fifth Avenue.What to call, or not call, a neighborhood is a near perennial issue across New York, sometimes pitting residents against the real-estate industry, city officials or historians. Residents in the Bronx neighborhood of Allerton recently campaigned to have their area recognized. In Brooklyn, \u201cPLG\u201d is taking root in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, while \u201cProCro,\u201d where Prospect Heights borders Crown Heights, has prompted outcry.But amid a shifting population in Harlem\u2014a historically and culturally important neighborhood, home to the Apollo Theater, gospel worship and long-established soul-food restaurants\u2014SoHa strikes a particular nerve.Longtime residents point to a 15-story building on Frederick Douglass Boulevard called SOHA 118, built in 2006, as the genesis of the SoHa trend. Real-estate company       Keller Williams       NYC has had a SoHa team for some time, and the shorthand has been seeping into other brokers\u2019 parlance. It\u2019s also popping up on everything from restaurant menus to street-front signage, according to residents.Critics say that beyond being historically inaccurate, using SoHa reflects an effort by some in the real-estate industry to draw a parallel with SoHo, the chic downtown area that started the moniker trend, and drive up already escalating rents in the area. Median rent in central Harlem was $1,050 in 2015, up from $710 in 2000, according to census data analyzed by NYU Furman Center.Replacing \u201cHarlem\u201d with the new acronym is also seen as an attempt to erase black culture, said       Danni Tyson,        a real-estate broker and member of Community Board 10, a local panel that deals with community issues. \u201cWhen you remove a name, you\u2019re losing something,\u201d said Ms. Tyson. \u201cAnd with us, Harlem, it means a sense of black culture.\u201dMr. Espaillat said there is \u201can underlying subtle racial, economic message\u201d with SoHa. \u201cIt\u2019s very divisive.\u201dA spokeswoman for the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry group, declined to comment on the SoHa friction, saying only that the group supports existing New York regulations that state the \u201cuse by real estate brokers, associate real estate brokers and real estate salespersons of a name to describe an area that would be misleading to the public is prohibited.\u201dResponding to pressure, Keller Williams NYC decided to change the name of its SoHa team, a spokeswoman said. \u201cThe team has a passion for the people, the history and the culture of the neighborhood they also call home,\u201d she said. \u201cWith respect to the neighborhood and people of Harlem, they will change their team name.\u201dHarlem\u2019s boundaries have fluctuated for generations. New York City maps from the 1850s put Harlem in the area east of Fifth Avenue, which is now generally considered East Harlem. The neighborhood\u2019s boundary dips as far south as East 74th Street on some historical maps, according to       Kate Cordes,        assistant director of maps, local history and genealogy at the New York Public Library.The 1995 edition of the Encyclopedia of New York City states that Harlem is \u201cbounded to the north by the Harlem River, to the east by Fifth Avenue, to the south by 110th (Central Park North), and to the west by Morningside and St. Nicholas avenues.\u201d Those parameters can be found on current maps issued by the city\u2019s Department of Planning, albeit with disclaimers that neighborhood names aren\u2019t officially designated.\u201cNeighborhood names are subjective and organic,\u201d said Rachaele Raynoff, a spokeswoman for the Department of Planning. They are informed by, among other things, history, geography and residents\u2019 preference, which can evolve over time.With his resolution, Mr. Espaillat said he wants to ensure there is no evolution of \u201cHarlem,\u201d especially not on maps or GPS systems. He proposes that Harlem is really the \u201cgreater Harlem area,\u201d which includes neighborhoods like Morningside Heights, Hamilton Heights and Sugar Hill.Jacqueline Jimoh,        a 71-year-old lifelong resident of Harlem, said people can try to break down the neighborhood however they like\u2014East, West or Central. But \u201cyou\u2019re not going to change it. You don\u2019t like it? You go elsewhere.\u201dStanding in Morningside Park on a recent afternoon,       Brian McLeod,        37, said SoHa will never catch on. \u201cThis is Harlem,\u201d the lifelong resident      \ufeff       said. \u201cSoHo is SoHo.

No, no.\u201d\u2014Mariana Alfaro contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-07-01 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/soha-is-a-renaissance-few-in-harlem-want-1498914001", "news_title": "\u2018SoHa\u2019 Is a Renaissance Few in Harlem Want", "keywords": "adriano espaillat,gentrification,harlem,new york city,soha,south harlem,Adriano Espaillat,Danni Tyson,marketing,markets,branding,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014China\u2019s box office remains in the doldrums, and that trend looms large as Hollywood studios angle to increase the number of films they release in theaters here.At the year\u2019s midway-point, Chinese cinemas have grossed an estimated 25 billion yuan, or $3.69 billion, according to Beijing film research firm EntGroup. That is a tepid 2% rise over the first six months of 2016.The slow growth extends a trend that started in 2016, when the box office grew 3.7%. Over the previous five years, Chinese box office revenue rose an average of 34% annually.One drag this year has been the lack of domestic Chinese-language hits, which are important in driving theater attendance outside major cities.\u201cThe local audiences are getting pickier and demand local films with better quality,\u201d said       Wang Bei       of iMiner, another Beijing film research company. \u201cAll those crappy local films in previous years have exhausted the moviegoing passion of local audiences, and it takes time to rebuild their confidence toward these movies.\u201dAnother drag on the box office has been China\u2019s embrace of video streaming, analysts said. About 80 million Chinese consumers now pay to stream videos, up nearly 32% from a year ago, according to Beijing-based research firm Analysys.The top-performing Chinese film this year is       Jackie Chan\u2019s       \u201cKung Fu Yoga,\u201d which took in nearly 1.8 billion yuan. Last year\u2019s Chinese production of \u201cThe Mermaid\u201d nearly doubled that with close to 3.4 billion yuan.The one bright spot in China\u2019s box office has been Hollywood films, led by the latest offering of \u201cThe Fast and the Furious\u201d franchise, Universal\u2019s \u201cFate of the Furious,\u201d which has grossed nearly 2.7 billion yuan ($400 million).After years of rapid growth, the sharp slowdown suggests the market could be near its peak, giving Hollywood studios a sense of urgency as the U.S. and China renegotiate the 2012 deal that gave better access for American films in China, according to a person familiar with the situation.\u201cWe believe we only get one shot at this, so we need to go for as much as we can including higher revenue share and better handling of release dates,\u201d the person said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other industry growth right now. Getting more money from China can still move the needle.\u201dThe current deal requires China to allow theatrical distribution of at least 34 Hollywood films annually, with the studios getting 25% of the revenue. It doesn\u2019t apply to films for which theatrical distribution rights are sold for a flat fee.The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is negotiating with its counterpart in China on behalf of the studios, and the two sides have until early 2018 to come to a new five-year agreement.The Motion Picture Association of America, the studio trade group, has asked the trade representative to seek concessions that include increasing the quota by at least 20 films a year and allowing studios to keep about 40% of the box-office grosses, in line with some other foreign markets, the person said. In the U.S., studios keep about 60% of the box-office receipts for hit movies.The trade group also wants to end blackout periods when state-backed China Film Group, which distributes most films, restricts theaters to Chinese movies, typically during peak moviegoing periods such as national holidays.In addition, the MPAA wants more advance notice of release dates, people familiar with the matter have said. Currently, the government notifies the studios often just four to six weeks ahead of the release date, limiting their ability to plan a marketing campaign.China Film Group and the MPAA didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Getting China to make major concessions may be difficult this year ahead of the Communist Party\u2019s congress this fall, when party leaders will want to show they are putting national interests first, the person close to the talks said.At the same time, China\u2019s leaders want to tout steady growth at the box office, and for that they need imports.Imported films have generated 61% of China\u2019s box-office grosses this year, by far the biggest margin since 2012. Chinese films accounted for slightly more than half of the box office last year.Overall, the 57 foreign films released in China for the first half of 2017 have grossed 15.38 billion yuan, up from 11.59 billion yuan grossed by 43 foreign films during the same period last year. This includes films whose Chinese distribution rights were sold for a flat fee.\u2014Lilian Lin and Wayne Ma contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-07-01 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hollywood-seeks-better-deal-as-chinas-box-office-growth-slows-1498914000", "news_title": "Hollywood Seeks Better Deal as China\u2019s Box Office Growth Slows", "keywords": "china box office, chinese cinemas, films, foreign films, movies, theaters, theatres,China Film Group,Motion Picture Association of America,Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,ownership changes,physical asset transactions,marketing,markets,corporate,industry imports,industry exports,corporate actions,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,television,film production,cinema film production,media"}, {"content": "CALGARY\u2014One of the best-performing oil companies in the past year is gaining favor with investors in part by embracing an unusual strategy: promising not to reinvest in its core business \u201cin\u00a0the foreseeable future.\u201dThe company is\u00a0            Suncor\u00a0Energy Inc.,        SU 2.34%       Canada\u2019s largest oil producer, and the core business is the country\u2019s controversial oil sands. A host of big international oil companies have plotted a speedy retreat from the region because of concerns about how the once-booming area can remain lucrative in the face of regulation to limit carbon emissions and relatively cheap U.S. shale drilling.Despite the cloud over the oil sands,\u00a0Suncor\u00a0shares outperformed every major North American oil company from June 2016 to May, as well as the S&P 500 index. Most other energy producers have been routed as crude prices have fallen by almost 20% since April.Suncor\u00a0has gained favor in part by heeding the chill on investment. After years of spending to ramp up new projects, the company is about to take a pause in the oil sands, where operators must use steam or expensive equipment to transform the tar-like crude into a substance suitable for refining.Instead,\u00a0Suncor\u00a0plans to give investors much of the excess cash it will generate in the coming years. From this year to 2020, Suncor may generate $15 billion in free cash flow, according to             Goldman Sachs.\u201cWe\u2019ve decided to let the shareholders see the cash,\u201d Chief Executive       Steve Williams       said in an interview. \u201cWe can continue this model for a lot longer.\u201dSuncor\u2019s run, which has slowed in the past month as crude prices fell, is a testament to changing investor appetites for oil companies. A decade ago, a promise not to invest in a company\u2019s core business \u201cin\u00a0the foreseeable future,\u201d as Mr. Williams assured investors in February, might engender a lack of confidence.But in a world where uncertainty looms due to questions about price swings, demand, new technology and climate regulations, a pledge to give cash to shareholders rather than spend it has been welcomed.Suncor\u00a0is a top pick among energy analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and is recommended as a \u201cbuy\u201d by 81% of analysts, more than any other big oil producer. Including reinvested dividends, the company\u2019s U.S. shares returned 18% to shareholders from June of last year to May 31. That\u2019s better than every other major North American oil company in that time.Mr. Williams hasn\u2019t sworn off the oil sands forever, only investments in new, company-built projects. Acquisitions remain a possibility if valuable assets are available on the cheap. Rather, he has assured shareholders that\u00a0Suncor\u00a0can continue to grow, generate cash and buy back shares even at low oil prices.Investor enthusiasm hasn\u2019t spilled over to many other oil sands companies.             Cenovus Energy Inc.,       a smaller\u00a0Suncor\u00a0rival, has fallen almost 50% since announcing a $13 billion deal in March to expand its oil sands output. The company said last\u00a0month that it would replace its CEO as investors soured on the deal.Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC,             Statoil AS      A,             Marathon Oil Corp.       and             ConocoPhillips                   have disposed of Canadian assets in the past year, and analysts expect others to follow.Production in Alberta\u2019s oil sands tends to be more expensive and carbon intensive due to the added energy needed to make the heavy oil flow. The higher emissions stemming from such techniques have made Canadian crude a target of environmental activists.The big oil exodus from Canada has come as low prices force companies to favor operations that turn a profit quickly and require less upfront investment. Being a low-cost producer will be an advantage if oil demand falls and prices remain depressed for years.Although shale production is usually seen as the lowest-cost opportunity available to most big oil companies,\u00a0Suncor\u00a0also has seen the cost of its operations fall.The cash cost of\u00a0Suncor\u2019s oil sands operations has declined by 30% to 40% since 2009 and reached $17 a barrel in April, according to Wolfe Research. That is competitive with some of the lowest-cost production in the U.S.Mr. Williams says\u00a0Suncor\u00a0will be able to cut costs further in ways that will also reduce emissions. The company is testing autonomously driven mining trucks in certain operations.\u00a0Suncor\u00a0and others also have begun using solvents instead of steam\u2014requiring less energy and lower emissions\u2014to make the tar-like oil easier to extract, process and ship.\u201cHydrocarbons have a fundamental part to play in the energy mix forever,\u201d says Mr. Williams. \u201cTechnologically, we can solve most of the issues.\u201dSome of the company\u2019s oil sands operations will soon have carbon emissions that are comparable to other kinds of extraction, he says. While regulatory concerns may intensify, for now restrictions in even the most stringent areas equate to a price of just $1 a barrel, he says, suggesting that concerns about such costs are overblown.Some investors remain wary of making a big bet on the oil sands due to coming regulations. They see the industry\u2019s future as similar\u00a0to energy utilities that generally don\u2019t see massive growth but are popular with shareholders for returning cash.\u201cGrowth will be very difficult,\u201d given\u00a0potential caps on carbon emissions and the flight of capital to other areas, said       Rafi Tahmazian,        senior portfolio manager at Canoe Financial Corp., a Calgary-based investment fund with about $700 million in energy investments. \u201cThe future of the oil sands is to forget about growth, manage assets well and become a yield play.\u201dWrite to Bradley Olson at Bradley.Olson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-01 08:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-company-wins-over-investors-by-promising-to-stop-looking-for-oil-1498910581", "news_title": "Oil Company Wins Over Investors by Promising to Stop Looking for Oil", "keywords": "crude producers,energy,energy deals,oil company shares,oil drilling,oil prices,oil production,oil sands,Suncor Energy,SU,corporate,industrial news,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas,shale"}, {"content": "Just as summer is ramping up, Myrtle Beach, a top South Carolina summer destination, is dealing with a flurry of violence that has city and state officials scrambling to calm worried visitors and residents.In the city\u2019s most prominent incident, at least seven people were injured in a June 18 shooting that was live-streamed on Facebook. That shooting\u2014and two others that weekend\u2014followed six over the Easter holidays in April.The violence prompted South Carolina\u2019s Republican Gov.       Henry McMaster       to visit the city not long after and order steps to beef up security, such as bringing in officers and staff to support local police. The city, meanwhile, has placed barricades along Ocean Boulevard, the beach\u2019s central artery where the June shooting happened.\u201cWhatever it takes to make sure that this aberration does not take place again,\u201d Gov. McMaster said. \u201cOur tourism industry is huge; it\u2019s very important to us.\u201dThe state estimates that tourism is a $20.2 billion industry in the Palmetto State, generating about $1.5 billion in state and local tax revenues in 2015, according to the latest data available.Tourism drives Myrtle Beach\u2019s local economy, and each group visiting the city spends about $2,766, according to the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce.The Grand Strand, a group of South Carolina beach communities which includes Myrtle Beach, has seen an increase in tourism in recent years, with arrivals via plane rising 6% in 2016 from the year before, according to data from Myrtle Beach International Airport. The vast majority of visitors drive to Myrtle Beach from the Southeast.With only about 32,000 year-round residents, Myrtle Beach becomes \u201ca relatively large city\u201d every summer and the police force hasn\u2019t grown enough to meet current needs, said       Brad Dean,        president of the chamber. He estimated that the number of visitors to the area rose 24%, to 18 million, in 2016 from 2011. The city\u2019s year-round population is estimated to have grown 19% since 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\u201cWe need to invest in law enforcement to remain a safe and welcoming community,\u201d Mr. Dean said. It was too soon to assess the \u201creputational damage to our community\u201d caused by the violence, but some businesses have seen \u201ca small number of cancellations,\u201d he said.Mr. Dean said the chamber, which handles marketing for the area, was ready to divert funds for more police. \u201cI can message safety much better than I can message mayhem,\u201d he said.The police department had 296 employees in the 2015-2016 fiscal year, up from 276 five years earlier, according to the City of Myrtle Beach records, while the total police budget rose 38% over that time.At the same time, smaller beach towns along the Atlantic coast have seen more people coming to their area in recent years because they are more family-focused, quieter and safer, said       Debbie Smith,        a real-estate agent and mayor of Ocean Isle Beach, N.C.According to Ms. Smith, after the videotaped shooting in Myrtle Beach, one couple there left their motel and drove to Ocean Isle Beach and rented a vacation property from her. \u201cIf I was staying down in Myrtle Beach, [the violence] would make me think twice,\u201d she said.Ms. Smith said her community of 650 year-round residents\u2014which swells to about 25,000 during the summer season\u2014won\u2019t know if business has increased until the season is over. Ms. Smith said her town, lined by a string of old beach cottages and new low-rise condominiums, tries to focus on family visitors.\u201cWe\u2019re not very hospitable if you have a throw-down party all weekend,\u201d she said.\u2018The priority should be public safety and not advertising.\u2019Myrtle Beach, however, has grown into a large resort center in recent years, with tall condo buildings, large hotels and attractions that include dinner theaters and a large Ferris wheel that looks out at the ocean. The Grand Strand area is well known for hosting thousands of motorcyclists during bike weeks in the late spring. This weekend the area will have numerous large fireworks celebrations, a golf cart parade and a patriotic festival that will include a flyover by military fighter airplanes.The city has dealt with outbreaks of violence in the past. In 2014, police responded to at least eight shootings over the Memorial Day weekend when groups of bikers visited the beach community.At a special city council meeting following the recent shootings, some people called for Republican Mayor       John Rhodes       and other officials to resign. Mr. Rhodes didn\u2019t return calls for comment.Mark McBride,        a waiter, longtime resident and former mayor, said the city government has been ignoring a growing violence problem for too long. A large portion of local taxes are spent on advertising to bring tourists to the area, but not enough is being spent to make sure the city has enough police to handle the crowds, he said.\u201cThe priority should be public safety and not advertising,\u201d he said.Write to Cameron McWhirter at cameron.mcwhirter@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'S.C.

Rick Tyrrell, a psychology professor at Clemson University, plans to submit his findings to academic journals this summer.In one experiment, Dr. Tyrrell put 186 college students in a car\u2014\u201cnot all at the same time, obviously.\u201d One by one, the passengers were driven along a 15-minute route and told to press a button each time they were confident that they saw a cyclist.A stationary cyclist was placed along the route facing away from the car. The cyclist wore one of four combinations of clothes, from all-black to nearly all-fluorescent yellow.Although fluorescent jackets can make people more visible generally, in this experiment the fluorescent jersey didn\u2019t make the cyclist significantly more recognizable as a cyclist than a black jersey. When the cyclist wore fluorescent leg coverings, however, observers recognized he was a cyclist more than three times farther away on average than when he wore black leggings and a fluorescent jersey.\u201cHumans are really good at recognizing other humans,\u201d Dr. Tyrrell says, noting that pedaling a bike is an obviously human motion.Cyclists and pedestrians tend to overestimate how visible they are to others, previous research has shown.In Dr. Tyrrell\u2019s other experiment, he and his students tested the use of taillights to increase cyclists\u2019 visibility during the day. Both studies were funded in part by bike maker Trek Bicycle. While nighttime cycling crashes are more likely to be fatal, about 80% of crashes occur during the day, when most cycling takes place, according to U.K. data.The Clemson experiment found that from a distance of 200 meters, or about one long city block, a flashing taillight is significantly more conspicuous than an always-on taillight, which in turn is significantly more conspicuous than a taillight turned off.But most eye-catching of all: a solid light worn on the back of each ankle. The researchers custom-rigged taillights with ankle straps for the experiment. Trek\u2019s parts-and-accessories brand, Bontrager, doesn\u2019t make ankle lights.\u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking into for the future of how to make the right product for the consumer,\u201d says Scott Kasin, Trek\u2019s electronics and integration product manager. \u201cIt was truly eye-opening for all of us.\u201dA yearlong experiment with nearly 4,000 cyclists in Denmark found that those who used front and rear daytime running lights had 19% fewer crashes that caused injury than those in a control group.The likelihood of bike crashes is declining as ridership rises in big U.S. cities, data suggest. Rides on bikes offered through city-centered bike-share programs have surged\u2014to 28 million last year\u2014as the programs expand, according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials. Two cyclists have died in bike-share crashes out of more than 100 million trips since 2010: a woman in Chicago last year and, recently, a man in New York.Bike-share bikes are thought to be safer than personal bikes because they tend to be heavier, slower and equipped with lights, according to a report by the Mineta Transportation Institute, a research center at San Jose State University.Advocates say the best way to make cycling safer is to build more protected bike lanes.For night riding, New York\u2019s bike-sharing system, Citi Bike, is testing a product called Laserlight on 250 of its 10,000 bikes. The light, made by a London-based company called Blaze, is mounted on the front of the bike and projects a green laser image of a bicycle onto the ground about 20 feet in front. The image alerts drivers and pedestrians that a cyclist is approaching.An independent 12-week study found that a bike with a Laserlight in the dark is more visible to a driver than a bike without one in the daytime.In London, all 11,500 bikes in the city\u2019s bike-share program, Santander Cycles, are equipped with Laserlights, says spokesman Matthew Sparkes of Transport for London, which owns the program.The Laserlight automatically illuminates when it begins to get dark outside. On bike-share bikes, it\u2019s powered by pedaling. On personal bikes, it\u2019s removable and rechargeable.Bike headlights are brighter than ever.             Garmin\u2019s       Varia UT800 can be seen a mile away in daylight, company officials say.Brighter isn\u2019t always better. In recent months metal signs sprang up along a bike trail near Boston reading: \u201cPlease dim headlights & aim them down. Avoid blinding others on path.\u201dChristopher Tonkin, chair of the Arlington (Mass.) Bicycle Advisory Committee, says he isn\u2019t sure who posted the signs. The group left them up because members agree with the sentiment and have been seeing more high-powered LED headlights used day and night, Mr. Tonkin says.Mighk Wilson, executive director of the Orlando, Fla.-based nonprofit American Bicycling Education Association, says certain strategies can make a rider more visible. One tip in the association\u2019s classes on cycling skills is riding in the center of a lane rather than on the edge, so drivers don't try to squeeze past or turn in front of you.\u201cMost important, really, is your positioning on the road, which then enhances your use of those lights and makes you more relevant,\u201d Mr. Wilson says.Write to Rachel Bachman at rachel.bachman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'How Cyclists Can Stand Out cycling.'", "news_time": "2017-07-01 07:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-cyclists-can-stay-safe-on-the-road-1498906860", "news_title": "How Cyclists Can Stay Safe on the Road", "keywords": "bicycle,bontrager,clemson university,fluorescent,lights,more on fitness,rick tyrrell,trek bicycles,cycling,sports,recreation,routine general news,bicycles,bicycle parts,consumer goods,leisure,travel goods"}, {"content": "For evidence of investors\u2019 appetite for municipal debt, look no further than New Jersey.That is where delays have plagued the planned megamall American Dream for more than a decade. Nevertheless, investors last month flooded into unrated public authority bonds designed to revive the 2.9 million-square-foot project.The $1.1 billion offering, which promised returns of as much as\u00a06.86%, is a sign of how hungry investors are for new municipal debt despite mounting fiscal problems in\u00a0some\u00a0cities and states around the country.Buyers have snapped up nearly\u00a0$88 billion\u00a0in new public bonds this year through Friday, up\u00a08%\u00a0from the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters. That happened as\u00a0annual\u00a0borrowing\u00a0by\u00a0local governments rose to a seven-year high.It also comes as ratings firms have downgraded Illinois and Hartford, Conn., to the brink of junk status, and the troubled U.S. territory of Puerto Rico was placed under court protection as a way of sorting through its mountain of liabilities.\u201cThe market is able to take these individual events in stride,\u201d said John Miller, co-head of global fixed income at Nuveen Asset Management.The demand for new bonds is driving down costs for government borrowers and making existing debt more expensive for investors. The S&P Municipal Bond Index gained\u00a03.25%\u00a0year to date through\u00a0Friday.One high performer was a bond issued by the Harris County Sports Authority to refinance Houston\u2019s NRG Stadium. It returned 20.7% during the second quarter through Thursday, according to bondholder Nuveen Asset Management.The same authority struggled during the latest recession with soured debt deals, a cash crunch and ratings downgrades. But it has now been able to set aside enough money to repay the bonds, making them more valuable.Many investors still view public debt as a relatively safe way to make money because municipal defaults are rare and states aren\u2019t allowed to seek bankruptcy protection. But some observers say they see greater potential for losses as public expenses rise.\u201cRisk in the municipal market is building,\u201d said Matt Fabian, a partner at Municipal Market Analytics, in a recent note.The performance of the municipal-debt market in 2017 is a surprise to many observers, who expected a pullback following the election of President       Donald Trump.       The S&P Municipal Bond Index fell 3.46% last November\u00a0largely\u00a0because of expectations that tax cuts and higher inflation would reduce the value of tax-exempt debt, analysts said.About $27 billion flowed out of municipal-bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds during the last two months of 2016, according to the Investment Company Institute.But those outflows reversed at the start of 2017 as tax cuts and higher inflation looked less likely in the near term. Inflows have totaled $15 billion so far in this year. Lower inflation expectations typically give investors confidence that the debt will retain its value.\u201cPeople got more comfortable with the fact that tax reform is not going to happen anytime soon,\u201d said       Triet Nguyen,        a managing director at New York-based NewOak Capital, a research and advisory firm.A drop in municipal-bond refinancing combined with an increase in debt coming due during 2017 have also driven up bond prices as investors look for ways to use their cash, analysts said.\u201cDespite the Illinois and Connecticut headlines, munis have performed just fine,\u201d added J.R.

For the first time in the game\u2019s modern era, the five best players in the world\u2014and the five top seeds at Wimbledon\u2014are all over 30 years old.That makes them virtual AARP members by traditional tennis standards. The era when punky teenagers like Boris Becker, or even a 17-year-old Rafael Nadal, stormed their way to major championships before they were of legal drinking age suddenly feels as distant as players wearing ties and slacks on Centre Court.Behind that sea change is a dramatic shift in how professional tennis players approach the game now, because it isn\u2019t just the top players who are long in the tennis tooth.Half of the 32 seeds at Wimbledon, which starts Monday, are older than 30. Four others are 29. A decade ago, the top players older than 30 were 22nd-ranked Spaniard Carlos Moya and 29th-ranked Argentine journeyman Agustin Calleri.Spaniard Feliciano Lopez, who at 35 is old enough to play on the game\u2019s senior tour, won the title at the Wimbledon warm-up tourney at Queens Club last weekend. A crafty lefty with eons of experience on grass, the 19th-seeded Lopez is now being tipped for a deep run at Wimbledon.\u201cAge is just a number,\u201d said Brad Gilbert, who quit playing in 1995 at 34, ancient by early 90s standards, to coach Andre Agassi. \u201cYou see it in every sport now, athletes playing longer and playing better at older ages.\u201dIndeed, tennis is part of a sports ecosystem in which 32-year-old       Cristiano Ronaldo       is a near-lock this year to win a fifth Ballon d\u2019Or as world soccer\u2019s player of the year. David Ortiz, in his final season at age 40, clubbed 38 home runs and had an MVP-worthy year in 2016.According to Gilbert, tennis players began thinking they could play longer when Agassi made the U.S. Open final in 2005 at 35. (He lost to future king       Roger Federer      ).But tennis figured to be different, as it became increasingly physical during the past decade, requiring a freakish combination of speed, strength, endurance, and reflexes that wouldn\u2019t seem to make it very friendly past the typical athletic peak for a human of about 27-years-old.However, a variety of factors\u2014including skyrocketing prize money, better knowledge of fitness and nutrition, and the shaky psyches and physical weaknesses of players who were supposed to bump off the aging greats\u2014have made thirtysomething the new twentysomething in tennis.The game is dominated by aging matinee idols. Federer, who turns 36 in August and Nadal, who is 31, astoundingly split the year\u2019s first two Grand Slams after several seasons in which they battled injuries and played like they were past their sell-by dates.Tennis experts say both players have recaptured their former glory with a similar strategy\u2014improving their backhands and using the shot as a weapon rather than a defensive tool to set up a forehand. Federer skipped the clay court season to prep for Wimbledon\u2019s grass. Oddsmakers have pegged him as a 2-1 favorite.John McEnroe,        a three-time Wimbledon champion, compared Federer to the ageless and bionic Six Million Dollar Man. \u201cHe looks great and he\u2019s rested. It\u2019s an amazing story.\u201dBut with so many lesser thirtysomethings also still having success, clearly a larger dynamic is at work.Money, and the opportunities and comforts it provides, is driving the demographic change. Thanks to burgeoning media rights fees, prize money on the ATP World Tour has doubled the past decade, rising to $119 million this year from $58 million in 2006.The biggest beneficiaries are the top players, but being a top 30 player now affords a far better life than it did a decade ago. Italy\u2019s Fabio Fognini, who at 30 is ranked 29th in the world, has collected $8.7 million in prize money during an unspectacular 13-year career. He has already pocketed $700,000 this year while posting a 17-13 record.The aforementioned Argentine Calleri, who was the Fognini of his day, scratched out $3.75 million during his middling 14-year career. Even first-round losers at Wimbledon will pocket $45,500. A third-round appearance at the All England Club nets $120,000.The money allows the top players to travel with entourages that include coaches, trainers, physiotherapists, masseuses and nutritionists. The lesser players get similar treatments, albeit from smaller and less mobile teams. Everyone now knows the important roles rest, recovery and diet play in longevity. Instead of banging balls on the court for four hours of practice, they may hit for 90 minutes but do 90 minutes of strength, agility, flexibility and fitness training.The regimens have helped obliterate a group of players in the 26-29 age group, who normally would have taken over the sport by now. Since June 2005, just two players not named Murray, Nadal, Federer, Djokovic or Wawrinka have won one of the 49 Grand Slam tournaments. The Big Four of Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray has a combined career record of 175-43 against once-future greats Milos Raonic, 26; Marin Cilic, 28; Kei Nishikori, 27; Grigor Dimitrov, 26; and Juan Martin Del Potro, 28.Only Cilic and Del Potro have managed a single Grand slam victory. Del Potro has suffered through wrist problems. Raonic has a massive serve but shaky ground strokes. Nishikori is just five-foot-10 and has a weak serve. Dimitrov and Cilic can be brilliant but are inconsistent.Patrick McEnroe, the ESPN analyst who played professionally for 11 years and served as director of player development for the U.S. Tennis Association, said the serial beatdowns have likely caused chronic mental damage.\u201cGenerally if you are going to be a multiple slam winner you will win when you are young,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t do that the mental game comes into play.\u201dNow the players who appear most likely to topple all those over-30 greats are the ones who are in the under-25 set. They include 23-year-old Dominic Thiem, 20-year-old German wonder Alexander Zverev, and France\u2019s Lucas Pouille, who is 23 years old. They will have a serious void to fill.On the women\u2019s side, with 35-year-old       Serena Williams       busy being pregnant, the field of would-be stars is wide open. At Roland Garros\u200b, the unseeded Latvian Jelena Ostapenko emerged from virtual oblivion to take the title, and the top-ranked players have yet to prove they can win consistently on the biggest stages.Tennis has dealt with generational voids before. For years, the game\u2019s higher minds worried about what would happen when Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi retired. Federer and Nadal, arguably the two greatest players in history, solved that problem. Sampras won his final Grand Slam title in 2002. The next year, Federer won the first of his five consecutive Wimbledon titles. Three months before Agassi lost that 2005 U.S. Open final, Nadal won for the first time at Roland Garros.Write to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-01 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-geezers-have-taken-over-professional-tennis-1498906804", "news_title": "Why Geezers Have Taken Over Professional Tennis", "keywords": "sports,recreation,tennis,rankings,routine general news"}, {"content": "The scarcity of a simple medicine is complicating treatment for patients with a serious lung problem, one example among dozens showing how shortages of low-cost, essential medical products are causing problems in the U.S.The medicine, sterile talc powder, is used to treat malignant pleural effusion, a disease affecting about 150,000 Americans that involves excessive fluid buildup around the lungs and can cause shortness of breath and chest pain. The condition is often triggered by lung or breast cancer. Talc isn\u2019t a cure, but an injection of a talc-containing solution can adhere the lungs to the chest wall and prevent the buildup of fluids for months. The talc costs\u00a0hospitals about $120 per 30-gram container.Chronic drug shortages have burdened U.S. medical care for several years.\u00a0Studies have estimated drug shortages add more than $400 million in annual U.S. health-care costs because hospitals and doctors are forced to seek more expensive alternatives, and health-care workers must spend extra time managing shortages.The shortages of low-cost medicines have been caused by a decline in the number of suppliers for certain products and failures by companies to build enough production capacity or meet manufacturing-quality standards, according to a 2016 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Experts also say thinner profit margins for many older drugs reduce incentives for companies to invest in them.The number of continuing drug shortages in the U.S. was 176 as of March 31, according to the University of Utah Drug Information Service, down from 320 in 2014.In the case of sterile talc, supplies have dwindled because of a production problem, said       Areta Kupchyk,        an attorney for the substance\u2019s only U.S. supplier, Lymol Medical. The family-run, privately held company in Woburn, Mass., relies on a contract manufacturer,\u00a0she said, and production was suspended due to a \u201cmanufacturing issue\u201d involving a change in a product component. Ms. Kupchyk declined to identify the contract manufacturer and said she didn\u2019t know when production would resume.Sterile talc is derived from white rock typically mined from open pits. The shortage is the type that doctors and pharmacists find particularly frustrating because it involves a basic ingredient that can also be found in nondrug products. It doesn\u2019t have extra ingredients such as perfume that are found in consumer talcum-powder products, which are used for cosmetics and to absorb moisture.As a result of the shortage, doctors and hospitals are resorting to riskier and sometimes costlier treatments.       David Cziperle,        a thoracic surgeon who performs operations at hospitals in the Chicago area, said he learned of the talc shortage when he was told none was available for a recent procedure. He used an alternative procedure that involved using an instrument to roughen the chest\u2019s interior.Keith Naunheim,        a thoracic surgeon and professor at Saint Louis University School of Medicine, said he recently had to install a special catheter that continually drains fluid from a patient\u2019s chest because the talc was unavailable. Such alternatives have \u201cless proven effectiveness or more side effects,\u201d said       C. Michael White,        professor at the University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy.Other low-cost treatments in short supply include dextrose, a sugar paramedics and hospital emergency rooms use to help stabilize patients with low blood-sugar levels, and sodium bicarbonate, a sterile form of baking soda that is injected to treat excessive acid buildup in patients. The sodium bicarbonate shortage was compounded in mid-June when a             Pfizer Inc.       unit recalled 47 lots of the product due to potential microbial contamination at a plant in Rocky Mount, N.C.\u201cThey\u2019re commonly available chemicals but not so much available to us right now,\u201d said       Gary Blake,        director of pharmacy at Ascension Health\u2019s St.       John Providence       hospital in Warren, Mich. The hospital has formed a committee of pharmacists and purchasing personnel that meets regularly to discuss how to cope with new shortages, he added.The Food and Drug Administration has approved a marketing application for a foreign-made talc product to mitigate the shortage, but it won\u2019t be available in the U.S. until August at the earliest, according to a spokeswoman for its manufacturer,         Novatech SA       of France.An FDA spokeswoman said the agency works closely with manufacturers of drugs in short supply to help restore stocks, and asks other companies to increase production if they manufacture the same drug. The FDA says such efforts has helped cut the number of new shortages but can\u2019t prevent all of them.Troubles with Lymol\u2019s talc supply surfaced in April 2016, when the company recalled more than 25,000 canisters of an aerosolized version because a defective stem valve was hindering delivery of sufficient amounts of the substance, according to the FDA.FDA inspectors found a series of manufacturing-quality problems during several visits to Lymol between April and June 2016, according to a 15-page FDA inspection report obtained by The Wall Street Journal under the Freedom of Information Act. Among them: shipping talc to customers before getting the results of sterility tests, inadequate training of staff on drug quality, and failing to sufficiently investigate 86 customer complaints about defects in talc containers. Ms. Kupchyk, the Lymol attorney, declined to comment on the report.After the recall of aerosolized talc, Lymol continued to sell sterile talc powder. But the talc powder has been in short supply since February, according to the FDA.Lymol used to be known as Bryan Corp., which in 2007 pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges including selling sterile talc powder between 1997 and 2000 without FDA marketing approval and without properly sterilizing it, according to court records. The company paid the federal government more than $4.5 million in fines. The FDA approved the company\u2019s sterile talc powder for sale in 2003. Ms. Kupchyk declined to comment on the guilty plea. An attorney who represented the company in that case didn\u2019t return requests for comment.Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-01 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/shortages-of-simple-drugs-thwart-treatments-1498906805", "news_title": "Shortages of Simple Drugs Thwart Treatments ", "keywords": " medical shortages,medical supplies, talc,Pfizer,PFE,Novatech Industries S.A.,FR:MLNOV,output,production,corporate,industrial news,existing products,services,product shortage,cancer,political,general news,health,medical conditions,medical treatments,procedures,pharmaceuticals,wholesalers,retail,wholesale,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "Zach Deputy       never found exercise fun. But when his weight tipped past 400 pounds, he knew he needed to move more. Running was uncomfortable. CrossFit sounded like torture. And low-impact activities like golf seemed boring until the singer-songwriter\u2019s tour manager introduced him to disc golf six years ago. Instead of using a ball and club, players attempt to throw a Frisbee-like disc into an elevated metal basket in the fewest throws possible.On his second disc golf outing he landed a toss from 150 feet away. \u201cFrom that moment on I was hooked,\u201d he says. \u201cIf someone told me to hike up a hill for a beautiful view, I\u2019d think about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you put baskets up a mountain, well there\u2019s no question I\u2019d hike up to toss a disc.\u201dHe credits his passion for disc golf, combined with a high-fat, low-carb ketogenic diet, with helping him drop 100 pounds.Mr. Deputy is in the middle of his 10th year on tour. Some years he\u2019s averaged 300 days on the road. The 35-year-old has cut back to about 175 days of travel in 2017 to maximize time at home, in Savannah, Ga.Mr. Deputy competes in as many Professional Disc Golf Association tournaments as his schedule allows. His PDGA Player Rating is currently 894, which is similar to a golf handicap of about 10. \u201cI have a fantasy that I\u2019ll compete professionally in the Masters division,\u201d he says of the 40-and-over competition.Mr. Deputy tries to play six days a week and always covers at least one mile walking a course. \u201cI can get up to four miles of hiking up and down hills on challenging courses,\u201d he says. Most courses have nine to 18 holes. Completing a course can take anywhere from 40 minutes to three hours, he says.Tom Triplett Park in Pooler, Ga., is his home course. While on tour, he plays before shows. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to catch up with friends I haven\u2019t seen in awhile,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the disc golf course, you have a few hours to really connect.\u201d He estimates he\u2019s played 700 courses. Favorites include Maple Hill in Leicester, Mass., and DeLaveaga in Santa Cruz, Calif.As in golf, a disc golfer progresses down the fairway and must make each throw from the spot where the previous throw has landed, often dealing with obstacles like trees, shrubs and terrain changes before hitting the target, often a basket. \u201cWith golf, you shoot left or right. In disc golf, there are so many nuances\u2014you can throw backhand, overhead.\u201d Mr. Deputy is constantly trying to improve various throws like the roller, which is thrown on the ground, and a tomahawk, a vertical throw using a hook-thumb grip.Mr. Deputy embraced a ketogenic diet 2\u00bd years ago hoping to shed pounds. \u201cI tried every diet out there, and my body rejected each one in two weeks,\u201d he says. On the ketogenic diet, most of one\u2019s caloric intake comes from fats. \u201cLosing weight by eating more butter and sour cream really messes with everything we\u2019ve been taught about nutrition, but I felt great and the diet is sustainable.\u201d In one year he lost 70 pounds and now rarely eats sugar and refined carbs. \u201cI did have a fruit extravaganza for a few months eating watermelon and apples and probably gained 15 pounds back,\u201d he says.Breakfast is spinach and baked chicken topped with cheese and sour cream. Lunch or dinner might be a burger, hold the bun, and broccoli. On the road, Chipotle is a frequent stop. He orders a chicken bowl with no rice, light on the beans and heavy on the sour cream, cheese and lettuce.Intermittent fasting is part of the ketogenic diet philosophy, so he tries not to eat before noon or after 8 p.m.Disc golfers can choose from hundreds of discs. Many disc brands offer a flight rating system designed to describe a specific disc\u2019s speed, turn and stability. Mr. Deputy estimates he owns 400 discs. \u201cWhen a new model comes out, I need to know how it performs,\u201d he says. Discs retail for $7 to $30, but Mr. Deputy receives free discs from his sponsor, Innova.Tie-dye T-shirts and shorts are common on the disc golf course. \u201cI like loose clothing, like basketball shorts, so I\u2019m not constricted in a run up or throw,\u201d he says. Mr. Deputy rotates hard on his right foot, which wears down the sole of normal sneakers, so he now wears thick-soled, Keen Nasu Disc Golf WP sneakers. (They retailed for $130, but have been discontinued.) Most courses are free to play.Eat more fat to lose weight? The concept goes against conventional nutrition advice, as well as the federal Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion\u2019s Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which cautions that a diet high in saturated fat can lead to heart disease and obesity. But some researchers favor a high-fat, low-carb regimen, called the ketogenic diet.When the body enters the metabolic state of ketosis, it starts relying on fat-generated ketone bodies, rather than glucose, as its primary energy source. Ketone bodies are chemical structures made by the liver out of fatty acids, primarily. Ketosis is reached through a combination of fasting and significant reduction of carbohydrate intake, typically under 50 grams a day, says Dr. Ken Ford, a ketones expert who runs the Florida-based Institute for Human and Machine Cognition. On a ketogenic diet, people typically consume 70% of their calories from fat, he says.Torey Armul, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics based in Columbus, Ohio, says that while the diet has become popular in certain crowds, she wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\u201cA ketogenic diet restricts nutrient-rich foods, like whole grains, legumes, fruits and dairy,\u201d she says. \u201cA lack of fiber, in particular, causes gastrointestinal distress and may impair digestive health.\u201d Ms. Armul says there is also some evidence that a ketogenic diet breaks down muscle tissue for energy. \u201cThis diet is usually used medically under the supervision of doctors and dietitians. People need to be very careful about adapting for at-home use. A healthy diet is one that is sustainable and supports a positive relationship with food and allows for flexibility.\u201dWrite to Jen Murphy at workout@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-01 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-fitness-plan-based-on-lots-and-lots-of-disc-golf-1498906802", "news_title": "A Fitness Plan Based on Lots and Lots of Disc Golf", "keywords": "disc golf,exercise,fitness,frisbee golf,handicap,ketogenic diet,miles,more on fitness,walking,weight loss,workouts,Zach Deputy,political,general news,physical fitness,food,drink,health,living,lifestyle,nutrition,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "Tumbling oil prices are emerging as the latest threat to the long stock-market rally.U.S. stocks set records in the first half of the year, bolstered by steady economic growth world-wide and the best quarterly earnings among S&P 500 companies in nearly six years. Energy companies are expected to provide the biggest boost in earnings growth of the broad index\u2019s 11 sectors this year, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet, largely due to favorable comparisons with a weak year-ago period.S&P 500 companies are expected to post earnings growth of 9.8% in 2017 compared with a year earlier, according to FactSet. Without energy companies, that figure would fall to 7%.But some investors are concerned that the recent collapse in crude prices could dampen that bullish outlook. As of June 30, analysts expected U.S. crude would trade at an average of $52.76 a barrel in the third quarter and average above $54 in the fourth, according to FactSet.U.S. crude for August delivery closed up 2.5% to $46.04 a barrel on Friday, but oil prices are still down 14% this year. Oil in June entered a bear market, which is typically defined as a decline of 20% or more from a recent peak.Further declines in oil prices could renew concerns about the health of U.S. oil companies, refiners and drillers, whose profits bounced back in the first half of the year after several quarters of contraction.It also could prompt analysts to trim corporate earnings estimates\u2014undermining a key factor that has kept stocks climbing despite reduced expectations for policy changes from Washington, such as tax cuts and fiscal stimulus.\u201cClearly the energy sector has felt the impact of falling oil prices already\u2014and if keeps going, corporate earnings will definitely be impacted,\u201d said       Omar Aguilar,        chief investment officer of equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management.Early last year, a collapse in oil prices spilled over to the stock market, combining with global recession concerns to send shares lower. Stocks look better able to withstand oil-price declines this time around, analysts say.\u00a0They note energy stocks in the S&P 500 already have shed 14% this year. Among the biggest decliners are offshore-drilling contractor             Transocean Ltd.       and exploration-and-production firms Andarko Petroleum Corp. and             Range Resources Corp.Yet the broader stock market has been resilient: The S&P 500 has climbed 8.2% this year\u2014posting its best first half of the year since 2013.Also the stock market has been moving less in tandem with oil prices this year than last, when U.S. crude and the S&P 500 hit their 2016 lows on the same day.Perhaps the biggest factor is that the economic picture has changed: When oil prices slid in the second half of 2015 and the start of 2016, investors were contending with a number of risks beyond declining commodity prices, including signs of slowing global growth, shrinking corporate profits and a stronger U.S. dollar.This year, global economic growth is on the mend, with regions from the U.S. to Europe posting their strongest corporate earnings in years. And oil prices remain well off their 2016 trough, when U.S. crude settled at $26.21 a barrel, its lowest since May 2003.\u201cWe\u2019re in a very different economic environment, one where we can take a bit of a hit on oil prices without it necessarily affecting the recovery,\u201d Mr. Aguilar said.Many investors also largely consider the latest decline in oil prices to be an issue of oversupply, rather than a sign of waning global demand.\u201cAs long as oil finds a floor around $40 a barrel or higher,\u201d earnings should continue growing, said       Alan Gayle,        director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments.Write to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.comAppeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Stocks Face Energy Crunch.'", "news_time": "2017-07-01 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-price-decline-looms-as-new-stock-market-boogeyman-1498906806", "news_title": "Oil-Price Decline Looms as New Stock-Market Boogeyman ", "keywords": "2q market report, energy,equities,oil, oil earnings, oil prices, second quarter, stock market report,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,energy"}, {"content": "Even for an investment as volatile as bitcoin, the second quarter was wild.The cryptocurrency stood at $1,079 on\u00a0April 1. Over the next two months, it nearly tripled in price, driven in part by a surge of interest coming from Japan and South Korea. Bitcoin hit a record of $3,019 on June 11, and then fell 27% in the days after.It closed the quarter at $2,557.39, more than doubling its price during the three months. On March 31, it was at $1,079.75.Ether, a less mature digital currency, traded as high as $395 on June 12, up nearly 50-fold on the year, before suffering a sharp one-day flash crash and settling the quarter at $304.24.For bitcoin, ethereum and dozens of other smaller virtual currencies, questions abound in the second half. The bitcoin community, nearly a decade old, is still fighting over how best to expand network capacity. The current limit of seven transactions per second has slowed trading and led to higher fees. Some predict the stalemate could be settled this summer though, perhaps through splitting the currency in two.Ethereum, the platform that supports ether, has its own capacity issues: The ether selloff was accompanied by a surge in demand that overwhelmed the nascent network\u2019s ability to process trades. There were delays of hours and even days. On one exchange, GDAX, a multimillion-dollar sell order sparked a cascade of stop-loss orders that created a flash crash and forced the exchange to credit some investor accounts. At one brief point, ether traded for 10 cents.Both currencies will likely be driven in coming months by so-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs. A cross between crowdfunding and a securities offering, ICOs have become a way for startups in the sector to bypass venture-capital funding and raise millions, virtually instantly.Some of these startups have working products. Others have nothing beyond a white paper. There are no standards or regulations around these ICOs, and the quality of the offerings varies greatly.Many of the ICOs are using Ethereum\u2019s platform. A software standard within Ethereum\u2019s protocol made it relatively easy for firms to create digital tokens, and these entrepreneurs have taken advantage of it. In May, startup prediction market Gnosis raised $12.5 million. In early June, a startup called Civic, which is building digital identity products, raised $33 million. Later in June, another startup, called Bancor, building a trading platform for all these ICOs, raised $150 million.As these ICOs have proliferated, they have driven up the price of bitcoin and ether since the funds are being raised in those currencies. With more ICOs expected in coming months, regulators and investors may increasingly look at these new assets.\u201cThere are some fundamental shifts at play, and also a lot of hope in these prices,\u201d says       Charles Hayter,        CEO of research site CryptoCompare. Investors \u201cthink they\u2019re gonna turn copper into gold.\u201dDemand for bitcoin in Asia will also help drive prices. On the first day of the second quarter,\u00a0April 1, new rules went into effect in Japan that gave bitcoin official recognition as a payment method and instituted regulatory standards for digital-currency businesses.Soon, businesses like energy provider Nippon Gas and discount airline Peach were accepting bitcoin, and Japan\u2019s retail forex market was enthusiastically starting to trade the currency. Quickly, the yen trade became the second-highest by volume, trailing only the U.S. dollar trade, showing increased interest among Japanese buyers.Write to Paul Vigna at paul.vigna@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-01 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/virtual-currencies-got-more-volatile-in-second-quarter-1498906801", "news_title": "Why Bitcoin and Ether Went Wild ", "keywords": "2q market report,bitcoin,cryptocurrency,markets,outlook,virtual currency,commodity,financial market news,banking,credit,financial services,virtual currencies"}, {"content": "To understand what today\u2019s clothing shoppers want, take a look at the beer aisle.Niche craft brands are stealing share from traditional beverage behemoths, as customers hunt for something that feels special. The same is true in beauty and grooming, where startups are getting all the buzz.Target Corp.       is taking note and cleaning house, shedding some of its stalwart brands and launching more than a dozen new ones over the next 18 months in apparel and home furnishings. To make room, the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Merona line and men\u2019s Mossimo offering will be phased out, having grown too big and homogenized to garner shoppers\u2019 affection, executives say.Faced with slumping sales and stiff competition from rivals, including Amazon, Target hopes the new launches will give shoppers a reason to come into its stores.Each new brand has a defined personality and purpose, Target says, and isn\u2019t a nondescript label. \u201cPeople are looking for something that is more curated and meaningful to their specific lifestyle,\u201d says       Mark Tritton,        Target\u2019s chief merchandising officer. The goal is for A New Day, a more fashionable line of women\u2019s classics, and Goodfellow & Co, a modern menswear collection, to make an emotional connection with shoppers\u2014something Merona never was able to do.The new names, which will begin to appear this fall, are meant to complement the remaining brands, allowing each to have a clearer point of view, Target says. The athleisure-inspired JoyLab, for shoppers going from \u201ccrunches to brunches,\u201d will be marketed as a fashion brand, while the existing C9 Champion line is positioned to emphasize performance. Project 62, a home brand with a modern aesthetic in the works, will be displayed alongside the more traditional Threshold brand.\u200bIn addition to the launches, Target is making changes that it says reflect how customers want to shop today. Rampant discounts and promotions, which Target says have diminished customers\u2019 trust in retailers, will be kept to a minimum with the new brands. Thanks to better lighting and more mannequins, displays will resemble a boutique in a mall more than a big-box chain. New racks and shelves will allow for cross-merchandising, like displaying shoes alongside dresses.Total Target sales fell 5.8% last year, to $69.5 billion. Sales at Target stores open at least a year fell 1.3% in the first quarter. The chain reported a \u201csmall decline\u201d in apparel same-store sales in the first quarter.The Minneapolis retailer is investing heavily in its new brand strategy, hoping to boost profits with fresh interest in these high-margin categories.Half its apparel and accessories will be overhauled in the next two years, and more than a third of its home offerings. \u201cBrands become a great differentiator,\u201d says CEO       Brian Cornell.       Target wants to draw customers from struggling rivals, including department stores and specialty chains that are closing locations.The brands coming this fall will take a page from the playbook of Cat & Jack, a collection of children\u2019s apparel and accessories that Target introduced last summer to replace the clothing lines of Cherokee and Circo. The older labels were seeing same-store sales gains in the single digits, according to Mr. Tritton. \u201cThey weren\u2019t underperforming, we just felt they had overstayed their welcome,\u201d he says. Shoppers wanted clothes that were more stylish and durable.Cat & Jack sales have surpassed Cherokee and Circo apparel sales combined, with same-store sales rising double digits and total sales set to top $1 billion in the first year. Even as it swells in size, Cat & Jack\u2019s style focus remains the same, Target says, with bright colors, whimsical graphics and clever slogans. When customers wanted edgier, more fashion-forward styles for slightly older children, Target launched a brand called Art Class. It, too, is selling well, offering \u201cvalidation of why we need multiple brands with unique aesthetics,\u201d says Michelle Wlazlo, senior vice president of apparel and accessories.With many customers browsing online before coming into the store, Target has done more with its in-store displays to help shoppers make the connection. Both Cat & Jack and Art Class have their own landing pages on Target\u2019s website, with graphics and color schemes specific to the brands replicated in store displays. For Cat & Jack, a three-dimensional hot-air balloon calls shoppers\u2019 attention to the store shelves.To create niche adult brands for an audience as large as Target\u2019s\u201430 million people walk through its doors every week\u2014the company relied on insights consumers gave its market-research and design teams.Real shoppers will appear in some of the new brands\u2019 marketing materials alongside models. \u201cConsumers are looking for brands they can relate to,\u201d says       Rick Gomez,        Target\u2019s chief marketing officer, and \u201cseeing people like themselves\u201d helps draw that connection.Write to Elizabeth Holmes at elizabeth.holmes@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-01 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/target-rejiggers-brands-to-lure-shoppers-1498906803", "news_title": "Target Rejiggers Brands to Lure Shoppers", "keywords": "circo,merona,new brands,target,Target,TGT,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,marketing,markets,branding,corporate,industrial news,clothing,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,department stores,textiles,consumer goods"}, {"content": "The official beginning of the NBA\u2019s free agency period was still two hours away on Friday night when it no longer seemed to matter as much. The most intriguing moves of the NBA\u2019s off-season had already been made.The megatrade that the entire league had been waiting for turned out to be one that no one saw coming: a surprise deal in which the Indiana Pacers agreed to send forward Paul George to the Oklahoma City Thunder to pair with Russell Westbrook, the league\u2019s reigning Most Valuable Player.What happened late Friday likely revealed more about the state of the NBA than anything that could happen in this off-season. It was the latest evidence that star players want to band together. That\u2019s the only way they can contend for titles.One great player simply isn\u2019t sufficient. At least two is the bare minimum. Three is a nice luxury, but it still might not be enough. That\u2019s because the Golden State Warriors have four.Look around the league. Nearly every big move in the past few years has been a merger.LeBron James       went to Miami to play with       Dwyane Wade       and Chris Bosh and he later left snowbird life to play in Cleveland with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Kevin Durant abandoned Westbrook around this time last year for Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry\u2014who, by the way, agreed to a new deal almost as soon as he could on Saturday, in a negotiation so easy he could\u2019ve gone to sleep early and slept late knowing that in the next five years he\u2019d be $201 million richer.The clustering of talent continued in the latest season. At the trade deadline in February, the New Orleans Pelicans combined DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis. On draft night last month, the Minnesota Timberwolves packaged Jimmy Butler with Karl-Anthony Towns. Just days later, the Houston Rockets made their own explosive trade, creating a backcourt of Chris Paul and James Harden. And the Thunder struck the unlikeliest deal yet on the eve of free agency.But the more telling part about the Wolves, Rockets and Thunder acquiring Butler, Paul and George was that the Cavaliers, Boston Celtics and San Antonio Spurs couldn\u2019t lock them down, even though they tried. It\u2019s the good teams in the NBA that are realizing they\u2019re not good enough.Oklahoma City is the most recent example. As terrific as Westbrook was last season, when he won the MVP award by averaging a triple-double, the Thunder still lost in the first round of the playoffs. One player could only take a team so far. They needed another.The question now is how long they\u2019ll have him. The Pacers decided to deal George when he said he wouldn\u2019t re-sign there next summer, and the NBA\u2019s best teams then tried to steal him for a song. The fact that he was only under contract for one more season depressed his trade value\u2014Oklahoma City only gave up Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis for an extraordinary talent in his prime who complements Westbrook perfectly. It seems like they swindled the Pacers into breaking a dollar bill for a couple dimes.But George could be in Oklahoma City for just a year if no one convinces him to live and work there instead of in Los Angeles. He could also be in Oklahoma City for many years if he signs a new contract next summer and Westbrook agrees to his own supermax extension this summer.That\u2019s a risk every good team would take to get better, though, and it was only appropriate that Oklahoma City was the one taking a stunning chance while the basketball world counted down the hours until midnight.There are three ways for NBA teams to get star players: through the draft, through a trade or through free agency. But for small-market teams there are two. Oklahoma City had Durant, Harden and Westbrook because they drafted them. Now they have George because they traded for him.\u201cWe\u2019re going to pursue everything,\u201d Thunder General Manager Sam Presti said last week. \u201cDon\u2019t be upset just because it\u2019s not spewing out of this building that we\u2019re not pursuing the same things that you read about on the internet.\u201dThere are lots of things for an NBA obsessive to read about on the internet these days. Some of those stories might even be accurate.Gordon Hayward may leave the Utah Jazz to sign with the Celtics. Kyle Lowry may decide the Toronto Raptors can\u2019t win a title and seek out another situation. Carmelo Anthony may waive his no-trade clause to escape the New York Knicks for any team that is not the New York Knicks.But the past week in the NBA has been a reminder that a realignment of star players is the only thing that can really shake the league this summer. There aren\u2019t many players waiting to be moved. The chaos may have been over before it began.That\u2019s why one improbable winner of the first night of free agency was a team that didn\u2019t make a significant decision and doesn\u2019t have a permanent general manager: the Cavaliers.Cleveland was the class of the East. Then the East got worse. The league\u2019s elite players have migrated to the West and left the NBA with an obvious power imbalance. The Wolves getting Butler, the Thunder getting George, the Los Angeles Clippers keeping Blake Griffin and the Celtics getting none of them means the Cavs will almost certainly remain the Warriors of their conference.That\u2019s the bleak reality for the rest of the league. A lot has happened since the Warriors and Cavaliers\u2019 third straight Finals, but little has made their fourth straight Finals less likely. They\u2019re still the teams with the most stars.Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-01 06:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-nbas-stars-are-realigning-1498904215", "news_title": "The NBA\u2019s Stars Are Realigning", "keywords": "chris bosh ,dwyane wade ,lebron james ,nba ,nba trades ,oklahoma city thunder,paul george ,russell westbrook ,Boston Celtics,Indiana Pacers,Oklahoma City Thunder,basketball,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a stern warning to Hong Kong, where a pro-democracy movement has provoked mass protests in recent years, saying challenges to Beijing\u2019s authority won\u2019t be tolerated.\u201cAny attempt to endanger China\u2019s sovereignty and security, challenge the power of the central government\u2026or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland is an act that crosses the red line, and is absolutely impermissible,\u201d Mr. Xi said in a speech marking the 20th anniversary of the city\u2019s return to Chinese rule from Britain.The 64-year-old leader spoke at the end of a three-day visit to Hong Kong, his first as China\u2019s president, as the mainland exerts growing influence over a city that has operated with a free-market ethos under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement introduced in the 1997 handover. In the past year, mainland authorities have intervened in local elections and moved to block pro-democracy Hong Kong legislators from taking their seats.The speech was an admonition to the city of seven million people to end an era of political upheaval and embrace its place in broader China. Mr. Xi, who left the city Saturday afternoon, extolled the virtues of Hong Kong\u2019s free-market system as a source of growth and a symbol of mainland accommodation and promotion of \u201cglobal peace.\u201dMr. Xi lauded the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model as a success and affirmed China\u2019s long-term commitment to it. But he cautioned against the risks of political turmoil.\u201cMaking everything political or deliberately creating differences and provoking confrontation will not resolve the problems,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cIt can only severely hinder Hong Kong\u2019s social and economic development.\u201dHe demanded changes, some of which have the potential to rekindle controversy. For example, Mr. Xi underscored the need to \u201cstep up the patriotic education of the young people,\u201d reviving the memory of a failed 2012 attempt to introduce a pro-China curriculum in Hong Kong schools. The initiative sparked mass protests by local parents who decried it as Communist Party brainwashing.Analysts say pressure now falls on Hong Kong\u2019s new leader, Carrie Lam, to reintroduce the controversial measure. Ms. Lam, who was sworn in before Mr. Xi\u2019s speech, is expected to propose an anti-sedition law that failed previously amid large-scale protests.Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement appears mostly to have been subdued by the prosecution of protest leaders and a sense among many local residents that resisting mainland encroachment is hopeless. Mr. Xi\u2019s visit was marked by small rallies, but nothing like the mass pro-democracy protests that shut down parts of the city for 79 days in 2014.Mr. Xi has consolidated power since assuming leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012, introducing a sweeping anticorruption campaign that has often targeted his political rivals and taking on the title of \u201ccore\u201d leader, a designation that gives him broad decision-making powers. Exerting firm authority over Hong Kong carries enormous symbolic weight for Mr. Xi as Britain\u2019s 19th century colonization of the territory marked the beginning of a humiliating era of Chinese weakness.Though Mr. Xi\u2019s visit to Hong Kong was freighted with political meaning, it was also mostly a closed-door affair. Mr. Xi made none of the large public appearances usually associated with visiting leaders, and attended outdoor events only under highly controlled circumstances, such as reviewing People\u2019s Liberation Army troops garrisoned in Hong Kong. He didn\u2019t attend an outdoor flag-raising ceremony featured prominently on the schedule of handover events.Security for the visit was tight, with police fanned out across the city. Police detained small groups of protesters who called for universal suffrage and greater autonomy for Hong Kong. A new protest is scheduled for Saturday night.While the opposition movement has ebbed, its leaders said they hold out hope that further encroachment by Beijing would spark a revival of the protest movement, especially if new measures impinge on the city\u2019s way of life, grounded in rule of law.\u201cIf Hong Kong people don\u2019t stand up for themselves, don\u2019t come out and fight, then Hong Kong will turn into China,\u201d said Avery Ng, a leader of a Hong Kong democracy group.\u2014Chester Yung and Jenny W.

But it had the potential to excite the Republican base as Congress heads into its July 4th recess.Sen. Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) kicked off the push, saying that he believed congressional leaders\u2019 prospects of simultaneously overturning former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       2010 Affordable Care Act and enacting a replacement were dimming. He said that the party\u2019s best hope could be to wipe out the law in its entirety, then work on filling the void over time.\u201cOn the current path, it looks like Republicans will\u2026fail to pass any meaningful bill at all,\u201d Mr. Sasse said in a letter to the White House. \u201cWe must keep our word.\u201dHe suggested that if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) couldn\u2019t assemble a bill with broad GOP support by the time senators return from their recess on July 10, the Senate should vote on the same ACA repeal bill Congress passed in 2015, which was vetoed by Mr. Obama.Within minutes of the suggestion, which Mr. Sasse also discussed on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Mr. Trump signaled support. \u201cIf Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!\u201d he tweeted.Democratic lawmakers, who are united in support of the ACA, warned of the consequences of a repeal-first approach on Friday. Sen.       Patty Murray       (D., Wash.) said that Mr. Trump shouldn\u2019t urge Republicans \u201cto pull coverage and protections away from tens of millions of families and increase costs for tens of millions more without any plan for a replacement.\u201dMr. Sasse\u2019s move and Mr. Trump\u2019s response were notable in part because they pointedly circumvented Mr. McConnell, who has been laboring to produce a bill that would satisfy his party\u2019s conservative and centrist factions and win the support of at least 50 Senate Republicans.Mr. McConnell\u2019s office had no comment on the proposal on Friday.Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of consumers around the country are getting letters from insurers warning that their health plans bought under the ACA would be terminated at the end of the year.Republicans say the letters show the need for their legislation, while Democrats say insurers are reacting to uncertainty about the future of the health law that has been created by the GOP push.Mr. Sasse\u2019s proposal focused attention on July 10, when senators will return after a week in their home states hearing from their constituents. GOP leaders hope to use the recess to cement a deal that they can quickly bring to the Senate floor, but given the bill\u2019s unpopularity in polls and the GOP\u2019s divisions, that is by no means assured.With no support from Democrats, Senate Republicans can afford to lose no more than two votes and still pass their legislation, counting on Vice President       Mike Pence       to break a 50-50 tie if necessary. The House has passed its own version of the bill.The repeal-first approach reopens an old skirmish between Republican centrists and conservatives, whose disagreements over everything from the scope and timeline of an ACA repeal to the future of Medicaid and the nature of health insurance have hamstrung the party.Earlier this year, some Republicans advocated repealing the ACA with an expiration date a year or two in the future. That, they hoped, would pressure Democrats and Republicans to come together and craft a workable replacement that would kick in before the ACA expired.But others inside and outside the GOP warned that repealing the ACA without a replacement in hand would create enormous uncertainty, roiling the insurance markets, panicking consumers and making life difficult for businesses. That prompted GOP leaders instead to pursue a single repeal-and-replace bill, and at the time Mr. Trump voiced support for that approach.Some lawmakers said Friday that going back to the repeal-first approach would be a mistake. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t achieve what President Trump set out to do, which is to not only repeal the damaging effects of that law, [but] help people who are trapped in it right now,\u201d said Rep.       Kevin Brady       (R., Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means panel, which oversees health care.White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president\u2019s tweet didn\u2019t mean he had changed his thinking \u201cat all.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re still focused on trying to push through where we are,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cThe bottom line is we\u2019re focused on the end product here, and that is repealing and replacing Obamacare with health care that works for every American.\u201dDuring the previous debate over the repeal-first proposal, centrists said their primary concern was to avoid the possibility of a gap in coverage or additional upheaval in already-fragile individual insurance markets. Five Republican senators formally announced their objection in January to repeal legislation separate from a replacement.\u201cSen. Collins would not support this strategy,\u201d Annie Clark, spokeswoman for Susan Collins (R., Maine), one of the five, said on Friday.But       Rand Paul       of Kentucky, another senator whose support could make or break the legislation\u2019s prospects, endorsed Mr. Sasse\u2019s suggestion.\u201cI have spoken to @realDonaldTrump & Senate leadership about this and agree. Let\u2019s keep our word to repeal then work on replacing right away,\u201d he said on             Twitter.One challenge for Republicans is that party leaders have spent seven years since the ACA\u2019s passage calling it a catastrophe and promising to uproot it at the first opportunity. Conservative groups repeatedly cite the Senate\u2019s 2015 repeal vote, when 49 of the current GOP senators voted for outright repeal.\u201cAll of us believe the best solution all along is for the Republicans to do not only what they said, but what they passed when Obama was still in office,\u201d said       Jim DeMint,        former president of the conservative Heritage Foundation.Under Mr. Sasse\u2019s proposal, the ACA would remain in place for a year, giving lawmakers a fixed time to hammer out a replacement. But Mr. Sasse also said the Senate should stay in town in August, working six days a week to pass replacement legislation by Labor Day.Mr. Sasse had kept his position on health care relatively quiet, so his move Friday was a surprise. It makes clear the extent of the challenge facing Mr. McConnell, who already saw an unusual rebuke to his authority earlier this week when senators threatened to block a procedural motion to begin debating the health-care bill.Andy Roth, vice president of government affairs at the conservative Club for Growth, supported the Sasse approach, saying Republican centrists use the term \u201creplacement\u201d to disguise their support for maintaining parts of the ACA.\u201cModerate Republicans are very supportive of keeping in place large parts of Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Republican moderates want to oppose full repeal, then they need to answer to the voters.\u201dWrite to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.comAppeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition as 'Conservatives Seek Speedy ACA Repeal.'", "news_time": "2017-07-01 02:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senators-urge-trump-to-back-wholesale-obamacare-repeal-if-gop-bill-fails-1498825462", "news_title": "Conservatives Urge Quick Health-Law Repeal If GOP Bill Stalls", "keywords": "congress,gop health bill,obamacare,repeal and replace,republican health plan,trump administration,Donald Trump,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "MELBOURNE, Australia\u2014Australia and New Zealand have started free-trade talks with the Pacific Alliance, seeking increased market access and reduced tariffs with the Latin American trading bloc.Trade ministers from the two countries\u2014which have relatively small populations and are reliant on trade\u2014said Saturday that they were starting negotiations with the alliance, which is made up of Mexico, Chile, Peru and Colombia.Both Australia and New Zealand have been strong proponents of reviving the 11-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership after President       Donald Trump      withdrew the U.S. from it in January.An agreement with the Pacific Alliance would create new export opportunities for Australian farmers, miners, manufacturers and others in some of Latin America\u2019s major economies and, importantly, open the door to Mexico for Australian exporters, Australian Trade Minister       Steven Ciobo       said.The six-year-old alliance accounted for gross domestic product of more than $1.8 trillion in 2016 and the four countries account for 38% of the region\u2019s population and 57% of its total imports, Mr. Ciobo said.\u201cAustralia\u2019s ability to capitalize on this demand is limited by high tariffs that block trade,\u201d he said, pointing to levies of up to 80% imposed on Australian beef, up to 45% on dairy and more than 30% on sugar.In May, Australia began\u00a0free-trade talks with Peru in an effort to widen commerce with other countries in the region and as a buffer against U.S. protectionism. As a member of the Pacific Alliance, Peru was viewed as a steppingstone to an agreement with the wider bloc.Australia relaunched trade negotiations with Indonesia last year, recently began talks with Hong Kong and Mr. Ciobo said he was working toward free-trade negotiations with the European Union.New Zealand Trade Minister       Todd McClay      \u00a0said a free-trade pact with the alliance would open the door for New Zealand companies to do more business and increase two-way trade with four countries that have more than 221 million consumers between them.\u201dWe\u2019ve worked hard for trade talks with the Pacific Alliance over the last two years and today\u2019s announcement will be welcome news for our exporters,\u201d Mr. McClay said.In a statement, the Minerals Council of Australia, which represents dozens of mining and minerals companies, welcomed an opening up of export markets and increased investment opportunities for the industry as well as a boost for wider regional economic liberalization and cooperation.Write to Robb M.

But even some conservative states that voted for Mr. Trump, such as Texas, say they can provide only partial responses based on what is legally allowed under state law.Given the mishmash of information the commission will receive, it is unclear how useful it would be or what the commission would do with the information. Mr. Trump established the commission to investigate allegations of voter fraud in the 2016 elections, but Democrats have blasted it as a biased panel that is looking for ways to suppress the vote.New Hampshire Secretary of State       Bill Gardner,        a Democrat who is a member of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, defended the request Friday.

I think, whatever they do, we\u2019ll work with that,\u201d said Mr. Gardner, adding that the commission would discuss the survey at its July 19 meeting.He said he has received calls from unhappy constituents who said they didn\u2019t want Mr. Trump to see their personal information.\u201cBut this is not private, and a lot of people don\u2019t know that,\u201d he said.White House spokeswoman       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       criticized some governors and secretaries of state for refusing to comply.\u201cI think that that\u2019s mostly about a political stunt,\u201d she told reporters at a White House briefing.No state election official planned to provide the commission with all of the information requested, even Kansas, where commission Vice Chairman       Kris Kobach       is secretary of state. He sent the letter asking for the names, party affiliations, addresses, voting histories, felony convictions, military service and the last four digits of Social Security numbers for all voters.A spokeswoman for Mr. Kobach\u2019s office said the last four digits of Social Security numbers aren\u2019t publicly available under Kansas law and wouldn\u2019t be handed over. That was the case in many other states.Officials in 10 states and the District of Columbia said they wouldn\u2019t comply at all with the request. Those states are California, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Virginia.Oklahoma, where nearly two-thirds of the vote in the November presidential election went to Mr. Trump, will provide nearly all the information requested, save for the Social Security numbers.\u201cThat\u2019s not publicly available under the laws of our state,\u201d said       Bryan Dean,        a spokesman for the Oklahoma State Election Board.Mr. Dean said the commission\u2019s request will be treated like any other from the public. The election board will tell the panel to fill out an online form asking for the information. Oklahoma\u2019s voter roll is routinely provided to political campaigns, the press and other groups that ask for it.The letter from the presidential commission gives secretaries of state about two weeks to provide the voter data and other information, including any evidence of fraud and election-related crimes in their states.

Smith,        named the officials in a section of the document marked \u201cTrump Campaign.\u201d The document was dated Sept. 7, 2016. That was around the time Mr. Smith said he started his search for 33,000 emails Mrs. Clinton deleted from the private server she used for official business while secretary of state. She said the deleted emails concerned personal matters. She turned over tens of thousands of other emails to the State Department.As reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Smith and people he recruited to his effort theorized the deleted emails might have been stolen by hackers and might contain matters that were politically damaging. He and his associates said they were in touch with several groups of hackers, including two from Russia they suspected were tied to the Moscow government, in a bid to find any stolen emails and potentially hurt Mrs. Clinton\u2019s prospects.Mr. Smith\u2019s purpose in listing the officials isn\u2019t clear. There is no indication in the document that he sought or received any coordination from the campaign officials or the campaign in general.Mr. Smith died in mid-May at age 81, about 10 days after he spoke to the Journal. He said he operated independently of the Trump campaign.Officials identified in the document include       Steve Bannon,        now chief strategist for President Donald Trump;       Kellyanne Conway,        former campaign manager and now White House counselor;       Sam Clovis,        a policy adviser to the Trump campaign and now a senior adviser at the Agriculture Department; and retired Lt. Gen.       Mike Flynn,        who was a campaign adviser and briefly was national security adviser in the Trump administration.Mr. Bannon said he never met with Mr. Smith or anyone affiliated with a limited-liability company, KLS Research LLC, that the document said had been established for its mission.\u00a0\u201cNever heard of KLS Research or Peter Smith,\u201d Mr. Bannon said.Ms. Conway said she knew Mr. Smith from Republican politics but hadn\u2019t spoken to him in years. \u201cI never met with him\u201d during the campaign, Ms. Conway said. \u201cThere were no calls, no meetings, no nothing.\u201dThe White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did the Agriculture Department, Mr. Clovis\u2019s employer.Mr. Flynn,        his consulting firm Flynn Intel Group and his son Michael G. Flynn, who was chief of staff at Flynn Intel, were cited more extensively as Mr. Smith sought to recruit researchers, as well as in documents related to the effort that have been described to the Journal. Neither Mr. Flynn nor his son responded to requests for comment.The names of the other campaign officials haven\u2019t surfaced in connection with Mr. Smith\u2019s work except in the document, which the Journal reviewed on Friday.The document section that lists campaign officials is followed by the words, \u201cin coordination to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure.\u201d\u2014a possible reference to campaign strictures imposed by campaign finance and disclosure laws.The document was included in a package of opposition research Mr. Smith shared through an encrypted email with       Matt Tait,        a cybersecurity expert who once worked for British intelligence. Mr. Tait said he was approached last summer by Mr. Smith, who wanted him to help verify whether emails offered to the group by hackers came from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private server.After discussing his project by phone and in emails Mr. Smith gave him a document called the \u201cKLS research packet,\u201d which contained articles Mr. Smith planned to use for opposition research, Mr. Tait said. The packet cover sheet is the document that listed the Trump campaign officials.\u00a0Mr. Smith\u2019s name and phone number are typed at the bottom of it.Mr. Smith asked Mr. Tait to sign a nondisclosure agreement. Mr. Tait said he declined and ceased communications with Mr. Smith, never reviewing any purported Clinton emails.The document Mr. Smith presented to Mr. Tait, which he kept, is titled, \u201cA Demonstrative Pedagogical Summary to be Developed and Released Prior to November 8, 2016,\u201d which was Election Day.It cites as the \u201cpreferred vehicle\u201d for the effort a limited-liability company established in Delaware. Mr. Smith established KLS Research as that vehicle on Sept. 2, according to incorporation documents.The House Intelligence Committee and its counterpart in the Senate are investigating Russian election meddling and whether there was coordination with the Trump campaign. So is Special Counsel       Robert Mueller.       President Trump has denied any collusion. The Russian government has denied it tried to interfere.U.S. investigators have examined reports from intelligence agencies that tell of Russian hackers discussing how to get emails from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s server and transmit them to Mr. Flynn via an intermediary, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence. It isn\u2019t clear who the intermediary might have been or whether Mr. Smith\u2019s operation was the one allegedly under discussion by the Russian hackers.Mr. Smith said in the May interview he had assembled a group of technology experts, lawyers and a Russian-speaking investigator based in Europe to acquire emails his group theorized might have been stolen from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private server.He said that after vetting batches of emails offered to him by hacker groups last fall, he couldn\u2019t be sure enough of their authenticity to leak them himself and told the hackers to give them to WikiLeaks.WikiLeaks has never published such emails or claimed to have them. In a statement to the Journal, it said, \u201cWikiLeaks has never revealed a source and never will.\u201dAppeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition as 'Clinton Email Seeker Cited Trump Aides.'", "news_time": "2017-07-01 00:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-activist-who-sought-clinton-emails-cited-trump-campaign-officials-1498872923", "news_title": "GOP Activist Who Sought Clinton Emails Cited Trump Campaign Officials ", "keywords": "hillary clinton emails,presidential election,trump campaign,Hillary Clinton,Mike Flynn,Peter W.

While some states routinely wait until the 11th hour or later and have measures in place to fund government until accords are reached, the consequences are much more stark in many other states.\u201cFiscal difficulties and political difficulties go hand-in-hand,\u201d said John Hicks, executive director at the National Association of State Budget Officers. \u201cIt creates more hard choices, and therefore there\u2019s just a natural tension.\u201dIn Maine, the state teetered on the brink of shutting down parts of its government starting midnight Friday amid failing efforts to pass a compromise bill and meet the demands of Republican Gov.       Paul LePage.       Lawmakers have been grappling over taxes and education funding.To the south in the Nutmeg State, Gov.       Dannel Malloy,        a Democrat, signed an executive order Friday to keep the state government running after the Legislature failed to approve a budget plan to close a two-year deficit of $5.1 billion.Mr. Malloy\u2019s executive order will trigger deep spending cuts for the state and would amount to a $2.1 billion reduction for the entire fiscal year. The plan would slash education funding, eliminate summer youth-employment programs and cut rental-assistance programs. It will go into effect at midnight.\u201cThis is a regrettable path and one I worked very hard to avoid,\u201d Mr. Malloy said Friday. \u201cNevertheless, I want to assure the public that my administration will manage our finances in a thoughtful and responsible way.\u201dMr. Malloy had asked the Legislature to pass a 90-day \u201cmini-budget\u201d to keep the government running as his administration continued to negotiate with the Democratic-controlled state Legislature. But Democratic Speaker of the House       Joe Aresimowicz       refused, instead proposing a vote on a full two-year budget on July 18 while also raising the sales tax from 6.35% to 6.99%.The New England states are among a handful that have pushed budget talks to the end of the fiscal year. Other states locked in debate include Illinois, which hasn\u2019t had a budget in two years and has faced a risk of a ratings downgrade to junk status. Officials there took a promising step forward to resolve the standoff on Friday, with the House of Representatives voting to support a Democratic spending plan largely viewed as a compromise measure, although it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if the ratings firms would allow more time to work on a resolution.In New Jersey, Republican Gov.       Chris Christie       ordered a government shutdown amid the budget impasse. Only essential state employees will report to work, the governor said. State beaches and parks are expected to close, including Liberty State Park, which overlooks New York City and is scheduled to host more than 100,000 people for its annual Fourth of July celebration and fireworks display on Tuesday.Lawmakers in Washington state, meantime, passed their two-year, $43.7 billion budget on Friday, heading off a partial shutdown. Lawmakers there have been battling over how to meet education-funding levels mandated by the state Supreme Court.Washington state lawmakers released the details of their last-minute $43.7 billion budget deal Friday.\u201cAs I have said, a split Legislature means compromises are necessary and neither side will get everything it wants,\u201d said Gov.       Jay Inslee,        a Democrat who is expected to sign the measure.In Maine, a compromise budget bill released by legislative leaders appeared destined to fail late Friday as House Republicans voted against it, although talk of a new bill from the governor hit the House floor Friday night. Members of the legislature were waiting to see the surprise bill as the clock ticked toward a midnight shutdown.\u201cIt appears that a new budget bill from the chief executive will be coming forward,\u201d Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon, a Democrat, told lawmakers.A combative Mr. LePage earlier Friday had urged the House GOP to vote down the compromise for a two-year, $7.1 billion budget, upset it would raise one kind of tax without the cuts he wanted to another. Lawmakers did agree to repeal an added, education-supporting 3% tax on high income that state voters recently backed by referendum.\u201cI think this is a bad budget for Maine,\u201d the governor said at a news conference. He said he wouldn\u2019t veto it but also said \u201cI\u2019m not putting my name on this budget.\u201dBy law, the governor has 10 days to sign, veto or let a budget go into law without his signature, a spokesman for the governor said. So even if the legislature managed to send him a bill, the government could still shut down while awaiting his decision.\u2014Zusha Elinson and Kate King contributed to this article.Write to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.com and Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.comAppeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition as 'Deals Prove Elusive In Series of States.'", "news_time": "2017-07-01 00:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/maine-legislative-leaders-strike-budget-deal-as-shutdown-looms-1498830281", "news_title": "Maine, Connecticut Among States Likely to Soon Feel Pain Without Budget Deals  ", "keywords": "maine budget crisis,maine government shutdown,maine governor,maine legislature,maine politics,National Association of State Budget Officers,Dannel Malloy,Paul LePage,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}]
