He gestured at one wavering GOP lawmaker, Dean Heller of Nevada, saying, \u201cHe wants to remain a senator, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d and warned lawmakers not to leave town in August without a deal.Senate Republican leaders conceded defeat earlier this week on their effort to roll back and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, but at Mr. Trump\u2019s urging, they dug in Wednesday for what is expected to be the final push. Senate Republicans said they were hoping to rustle up 50 votes for a third version of the bill.Mr. Trump, telling the senators they were \u201cvery close\u201d to a deal, signaled the White House would take a more aggressive role in wrangling the 50 votes need to pass the bill. The GOP president suggested that Republicans had it easy in voting for the 2010 law\u2019s repeal when his Democratic predecessor,       Barack Obama,        was in office because they knew he would veto it and there would be no consequences.\u201cI\u2019m ready to act, I have pen in hand, believe me, I\u2019m sitting in that office. You\u2019ve never had that before,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cFor seven years, you\u2019ve had an easy rap: \u2018We\u2019ll repeal, we\u2019ll replace, and he\u2019s never going to sign it.\u2019 \u201dGOP leaders\u2019 immediate challenge is mustering 50 Republican lawmakers to approve a procedural motion that would allow debate to begin on their health-care bill.Adding to the uncertainty, Sen.       John McCain\u2019s       office disclosed late Wednesday that the Arizona Republican has been diagnosed with a type of brain tumor known as a glioblastoma, and that the timing of his return to the Senate would depend on consultations with his medical team.GOP senators said Wednesday night that the indefinite absence of Mr. McCain made their quest to get 50 votes on the health-care bill harder. \u201cThat does complicate things,\u201d said Sen.       Pat Toomey       (R., Pa.).Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said after the White House lunch that a vote on that motion would happen next week, regardless of whether it was expected to pass, and that he had \u201cevery expectation\u201d of trying to eke out a bill with majority support after that.\u201cI want to disabuse any of you of the notion that we will not have that vote next week,\u201d       Mr. McConnell       said.GOP leaders hope that once debate begins and senators offer a variety of amendments, a majority will emerge for some version. Earlier this week, three Republicans\u2014Sens.       Susan Collins       of Maine,       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska and       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia\u2014said they would oppose the motion to proceed on a repeal-only bill. Unless one of them changes her mind, debate can\u2019t begin because Democrats are uniformly opposed.Among the amendments may be one to largely repeal the 2010 law without an immediate replacement. An estimate released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office found that such a move would leave 32 million more people uninsured and would double premiums by 2026, compared with current law. The measure would reduce federal deficits by $473 billion over the coming decade, the CBO estimated.About 20 GOP senators huddled for more than two hours Wednesday night, but it wasn\u2019t clear if they had gotten any closer to securing the needed 50 votes. \u201cHard to say,\u201d Mr. Toomey said upon leaving the meeting.White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus came to the meeting but was asked to stay in a room separate from the one where senators held their discussion because some lawmakers wanted to speak privately, an aide said.\u201cWe\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re among ourselves,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.)Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska), an opponent of the repeal-only plan, was noncommittal on her stance after the meeting. Ms. Capito, also an opponent of that approach, declined to comment on the meeting.The GOP currently holds 52 seats in the Senate, leaving it vulnerable to defections from conservatives, centrists or any senator with a home-state concern. Democrats have remained unified in their desire to preserve Mr. Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement.GOP leaders are faced in the days aheadwith finding ways to lure back at least some of the GOP senators who have said in recent days they couldn\u2019t support the latest version of a bill aimed at overhauling the nation\u2019s health-care system.Ms. Capito, for example, is among those who have protested the bill\u2019s cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor. The administration is pushing the notion of waivers for states to redesign their Medicaid programs, including more support for low-income people. Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) said Wednesday senators had discussed the idea at lunch.Ms. Murkowski has similar concerns as well as a broader worry about her state\u2019s fragile insurance market. Mr. Trump cited the current struggles of Alaska\u2019s insurance markets as a reason for her to take action.Another holdout, Sen.       Mike Lee       (R., Utah), spoke with the president Tuesday, and Mr. Trump appeared open to the changes the senator wants, a spokesman for Mr. Lee said. A White House aide said the administration is open to any provision that increases GOP support for the bill.Mr. Lee has been especially concerned about alterations that were made to a provision of the GOP bill written by Sen.       Ted Cruz       (R., Texas), which was designed to lower premiums by allowing insurers to sell cheaper, less-comprehensive plans than allowed under current law.Similarly, GOP leaders have said they could address some of the concerns of Sen.       Jerry Moran       (R., Kan.) that the bill could negatively affect his state.Before this week, the president had been less active in the negotiations in the Senate than he was in helping pass health-care legislation in the House.The question is whether his late intervention can turn the tide. Some Republicans have been quietly skeptical of the president\u2019s arm\u2019s-length approach to Senate negotiations, though others have said he has been smart to hold back.\u201cDo the tectonic plates break and begin to move?\u201d said Sen.       Bill Cassidy       (R., La.), after the meeting. \u201cI can tell you they weren\u2019t before that meeting. The fact that the president comes in and very much emphasizes the need for momentum can break those plates.\u201d\u201cWe are getting close -- the issues are narrowing,\u201d added Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), a conservative senator who has said his support for a GOP bill isn\u2019t guaranteed.\u201cThere is still a hope on behalf of the administration and a lot of senators too that we can get there,\u201d said Sen.       John Thune       (R., S.D.), a member of the chamber\u2019s leadership. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take one more shot at it.\u201dFor months, lobbyists, GOP strategists and White House officials have described the GOP health bill in vivid metaphors, ranging from the biblical resurrection of Lazarus to the bathtub scene in \u201cFatal Attraction,\u201d where an apparently vanquished villain roars back to life.Heading into this week, a senior White House official predicted, \u201cThis bill will have been declared dead once, and resurrected at least once.\u201d Officials also regularly cite the House\u2019s success in passing a health bill after legislation was initially pulled from the floor in March.Democrats, for their part, are seeking to use Mr. Trump\u2019s revival of the GOP push to draw fresh fuel for their campaigns.\u201cLike the armored and mummified White Walkers from Game of Thrones, Trumpcare is hard to kill,\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.) wrote Wednesday in a fundraising email. \u201cRepublicans continue reanimating their terrible bill to kick millions of Americans off of their health care\u2026 Chip in now and support my efforts to kill this bill once and for all!\u201dDemocrats also hammered senators such as Mr. Heller of Nevada and       Jeff Flake       of Arizona, who are facing re-election campaigns in 2018, over the prospect of Medicaid cuts.Among those warning of dire consequences if Republican senators don\u2019t repeal Obamacare is Republican National Committee chairwoman       Ronna McDaniel.       She wrote in an email to GOP donors and supporters Wednesday that \u201cwe could lose the midterm elections\u201d because \u201csome in the Senate are refusing to even put a simple repeal bill on [Mr. Trump\u2019s] desk.\u201dConservative groups also joined in, including the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political-action committee, whose head Ken Cuccinelli said Wednesday the group would hold Senate Republicans accountable if they failed to pass health-care legislation.In the Washington swamp decried by Mr. Trump, Mr. Cuccinelli said, \u201cMitch McConnell is the head alligator.\u201dSuch threats may have limited effect on some of the Republican dissenters. Ms. Collins and Ms. Capito don\u2019t face re-election until 2020, and Ms. Murkowski isn\u2019t up until 2022. Still, conservative activists said they hope to send a broader message to Republicans about the importance of sticking to their promises.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about these senators; it\u2019s about the state of the Republican party,\u201d said Rachael Slobodien, spokeswoman for the conservative Club for Growth. \u201cThis is a much bigger fight.\u201d\u2014Byron Tau, Siobhan Hughes and Janet Hook contributed to this article.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com, Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.comAppeared in the July 20, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Prods GOP to Reach Health Deal.'", "news_title": "Trump Implores GOP Senators to Come Together Over Troubled Health Bill", "keywords": "affordable care act,congress,congressional republicans,health care,health exchanges,health insurance,health law,medicaid,mitch mcconnell,obamacare,senate,trump,Donald Trump,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,health care policy,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,private health insurance"}, {"news_time": "2017-07-19 20:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sen-john-mccain-diagnosed-with-brain-cancer-1500511475", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Sen.

The GOP currently holds 52 seats, compared with 48 for Democrats, and needs 50 votes plus a tiebreaking vote from Vice President       Mike Pence       to pass a major health bill that is struggling to gain traction.Dr. Stephan A.

It is just a nasty, incurable disease.\u201dTreatments include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, Dr. Mayer said. Many of the people who have such cancer, he said, are able to get into a clinical trial that is searching for a cure.A large group of Senate Republicans learned of Mr. McCain\u2019s diagnosis while meeting Wednesday night about the health-care bill, leading to a moment of stunned silence, said Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.). Sen.

Now Uncle Sam is going to get paid.Steven Cohen       is\u00a0one of many managers\u00a0preparing\u00a0to write\u00a0huge checks\u00a0in early 2018\u00a0due to\u00a0a crisis-era decision\u00a0to close\u00a0a tax loophole that long benefited\u00a0some of\u00a0Wall Street\u2019s wealthiest investors.The billionaire founder of SAC Capital Advisors LP\u00a0amassed deferred offshore income of more than $1 billion likely subject to\u00a0the\u00a0taxation, said people familiar with the matter.\u00a0Other hedge-fund managers facing personal tax bills of over $100 million include       David Einhorn       of Greenlight Capital Inc. and       Daniel Loeb       of\u00a0Third Point LLC, said people familiar.Total payments from all managers could amount to $25 billion, according to\u00a0a 2008\u00a0estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation. Some tax specialists say the bill could be even higher: $100 billion or more.This will likely mean a surge of tax revenue for Connecticut, historically the center of the hedge-fund industry. The state isn\u2019t yet sure how much it will reap, said a spokesman for the governor\u2019s budget office.\u201cAny projection would be too speculative to be reliable,\u201d the spokesman said.Hedge-fund\u00a0managers\u00a0are considering a variety of steps to raise cash or soften the tax blow. Some\u00a0will trim stakes in their funds to raise cash, says Brett Barth of hedge-fund investor BBR Partners LLC.Hedge funds often invest\u00a0through\u00a0vehicles\u00a0based inside and outside the U.S. They make money from their cut of 20% or more of trading profits.For decades, the Internal Revenue Service allowed managers of offshore funds to defer receipt of this compensation and both avoid an immediate tax bill and grow the savings tax-free. The IRS generally permits businesses to allow executives to defer compensation because such deferrals lower the firms\u2019 compensation costs, forcing them to pay higher taxes on profits. That offsets income taxes not immediately paid by employees.But this practice cost the Treasury income in the case of offshore hedge funds that don\u2019t pay any offsetting U.S. taxes.Managers\u00a0in some cases let those deferred trading fees compound\u00a0tax-free\u00a0for 10 years or longer.\u00a0Some also deferred management fees, even as\u00a0they amassed large fortunes from gains earned by their U.S.-based funds.\u201cThey kept rolling and rolling the money,\u201d says Richard Zarin, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP.The             New York Times                   in 2007 highlighted this loophole, and Congress overwhelmingly voted to close it the following year as a way of raising revenue and stabilizing the financial sector during the 2008 financial crisis. The change, part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of October 2008, was made in section 457A of the IRS code.The legislation gave managers a decade to pay taxes on money accumulated before the law changed. That deadline is now nine months away.The deferred fees\u00a0will be taxed at ordinary tax rates that can be close to 50% depending on where the managers live and work,\u00a0according to tax experts.\u201cThese are smart, aggressive people who don\u2019t want to pay more than they have to and writing a huge check can be quite demoralizing,\" said\u00a0Jonathan Brenner, a tax partner\u00a0at Caplin & Drysdale. \u201cMost recognize they\u2019ve had a good run and now have to pay the piper, though not after first asking six different ways if there\u2019s some silver bullet\u201d to eliminate or reduce the taxes.Mr. Cohen, who ran SAC Capital before it pleaded guilty to criminal insider-trading charges in 2013, is nearing a launch of a new firm to manage as much as $20 billion, The Wall Street Journal earlier reported.He has set that target, which would exceed the $16 billion managed at peak by SAC, partly because he wants to generate income to help pay the large tax bill, a person close to him said.Other\u00a0fund managers\u00a0are shifting headquarters to Florida to mitigate the tax impact, said a local official. Florida doesn\u2019t have a state income tax\u00a0on personal income.\u201cEven four or five years ago they saw this coming, they knew they\u2019d bring money back in and needed to be in a state with lower taxes,\u201d said       Kelly Smallridge,        president of the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County.Those moves are no guarantee of a smaller tax\u00a0bite\u00a0because states\u00a0generally examine where and when deferred compensation was earned, experts say.\u201cPeople have been banging on our doors since the provision was enacted looking for a solution and we still have clients coming in, but one hasn\u2019t been found,\u201d\u00a0says Mr. Brenner. \u201cEvery tax lawyer who touches hedge funds has had these kinds of calls\u2026there\u2019s\u00a0frustration among some clients that a solution has not been found.\u201dSome charities\u00a0say\u00a0managers anticipating a tax bite\u00a0are discussing donations\u2014to receive an immediate tax deduction\u2014rather than handing money to\u00a0the government.Other\u00a0managers are turning to charitable lead annuity trusts, said       Henry Bregstein,        an attorney at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP. These trusts give a donor an upfront deduction of 100% as well as the opportunity to transfer to heirs,\u00a0free of gift and estate tax,\u00a0the trust\u2019s remaining value at the term\u2019s end after making annual, fixed distributions to charities.Eileen Heisman, chief executive officer of National Philanthropic Trust says her organization is speaking to roughly 50 fund managers about establishing donor-advised funds by the end of year, three-times the usual pace. She attributes the increase to the looming tax bills.Such funds make grants to charities on behalf of donors after they contribute assets, enabling immediate tax deductions. Assets can be invested and grow tax-free even before the charities are chosen.Sometimes, these funds can be invested in the manager\u2019s own funds, with restrictions, Ms. Heisman says.\u201cThere\u2019s no way of knowing how much\u201d money will be paid in taxes or how much will be shifted to charitable organizations, says Ms. Heisman. \u201cBut we think it will be very large.\u201dWrite to Gregory Zuckerman at gregory.zuckerman@wsj.com and Rob Copeland at rob.copeland@wsj.com", "news_title": "Loophole Closed: Hedge-Fund Managers Prepare Huge Tax Checks", "keywords": "Greenlight Capital,SAC Capital Advisors,Third Point,David Einhorn,Steven Cohen,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,investment banking,alternative investments,credit,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities"}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/low-income-earners-see-weekly-pay-gain-faster-than-other-groups-1500543003", "content": "For the first time in years, pay for lowest-income Americans is rising faster than for other groups.Weekly pay for earners at the lowest 10th percentile of the wage scale rose at a faster rate last quarter, from a year earlier, than any other group measured by the Labor Department\u2014including those at the top of the income scales who earn five times as much.The shift for low-income workers\u2014including restaurant workers and retail cashiers\u2014who make about $10.75 an hour, is a sign that a tightening labor market is delivering better pay to workers who largely haven\u2019t shared in gains since the recession ended eight years ago, according to economists and government data. Last quarter marked the first time since late 2010 that this earning group\u2019s gains outpaced all others.Usual weekly earnings for workers ages 25 and older at the bottom of the pay scale rose 3.4% from a year earlier in the second quarter, according to analysis of newly released Labor Department data. That was stronger than median gain of 3.2% and the 3.1% improvement for workers at the 90th percentile, who earn more than nine in 10 other Americans. The percentage increases are based on a four-quarter average of earnings, to smooth out volatility in the data.Throughout much of the economic expansion that began in mid-2009, wage gains for the lowest-earning Americans trailed behind median wage gains and those of the highest earners. During 2015, top wage earners received about a 4% annual increase, while the annual raise for those in the bottom 10th percentile was near 1%.The recent improvement for low earners coincides with a downward trend in the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.4% last month, versus 4.9% a year earlier. The unemployment rate for those with less than a high-school education\u2014who make up much of the low-wage workforce\u2014fell even more sharply, to 6.4% last month from 7.5% a year earlier. Tighter labor supply in theory should push up wages.Usual weekly earnings is a different wage measure than the more broadly cited average hourly earnings figure reported in the jobs report each month. The jobs report showed average hourly earnings for hospitality workers, the lowest paid of 19 broad sectors tracked monthly, rose 4% in June from a year earlier, the second-strongest gain. The quarterly numbers, which tend to be volatile, are based on a survey of workers and include overtime pay, commissions and tips that might not be captured in the hourly figure.Average hourly earnings, which have been stuck near a 2.5% annual increase for most of the past year and a half, are based on a separate survey of private-sector employers.Wages have been rising swiftly in fields such as restaurants, amusements and gambling, said Jed Kolko, economist at job-search site Indeed. That is an indication that employers need to pay more to attract workers into those fields.\u201cIn a strengthened economy, people spend more on entertainment and eating out, raising demand for workers in those fields,\u201d he said.Those wage gains also at least partially reflect rising minimum wages in many states and cities. At the start of the year, the minimum wage increased in 19 states, and Maryland and Oregon raised their pay floors this month.Still, higher-earning Americans have fared much better during the expansion. Pay for workers in the 90th percentile has increased nearly 20% since mid-2009, better than the median gain of 16.3%. The 10th percentile worker fared worse, with pay improving 12.5%. That hasn\u2019t been enough to offset inflation during the past eight years.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see wage pressure at the two ends\u2014the high-skilled end and the low-skilled end,\u201d Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said in an interview this month. \u201cWhere the squeeze is still happening is the middle-skill jobs.\u201dHe said that could partially reflect new technologies emerging to supplant better-paid workers. For example, he said, sophisticated document-reading software is reducing law firms\u2019 need for armies of young associates to do the task.Since the recession ended, employment in legal services rose less than 1%. Employment at restaurants and bars is up 24%.Last year, the Wireless Zone, a chain of cellphone stores, raised base pay for workers at its company-owed locations to around $18 an hour, but cut back the bonus incentives it offered. As a result, the lowest-paid workers earn more, shrinking the gap between high and low earners. Average pay is little changed, said Dave Staszewski, executive vice president of the Rocky Hill, Conn.-based franchise. He said the change in pay structure was designed to attract scarce workers.He said \u200bthe strategy has been effective in attracting workers as these job seekers put a bigger emphasis on guaranteed salary rather than potential bonuses.However, some low-paid workers say the raises are still too small to make a difference. LaShawnda Obie, a Wendy\u2019s worker from Detroit, received a 40-cent increase to $8.90 an hour in January, when Michigan\u2019s minimum wage increased.

Beijing is also urging Washington to lift export controls that curb sales of high-tech products to China, Mr. Zhu said.The failure to take specific steps to close America\u2019s $347 billion trade deficit with China\u201470% of the U.S. global imbalance\u2014raises pressure on the Trump administration to consider shifting from its embrace of cooperation with Beijing toward more confrontation.Trump aides have been weighing a series of tougher trade policies toward China, from new import barriers on steel and solar panels, to tighter restrictions on investments, but have so far chosen not to implement them.People familiar with Wednesday\u2019s talks said that American negotiators tried, unsuccessfully, to use the threat of new steel tariffs to force the Chinese to commit to specific benchmarks for cutting the country\u2019s mammoth production overcapacity in that sector, a big factor dragging down steel prices globally.The meetings were held to mark the end of a 100-day period that President Donald Trump and Chinese President       Xi Jinping       had set to come up with a comprehensive plan to reset commercial ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The lack of any announced plan means they failed to meet that self-imposed deadline.The decision to issue a statement from just the U.S. side was a break with past practices after similar negotiations held in recent years during the       Obama       and       Bush       administrations. In the past, both countries issued common statements summarizing what they had discussed, emphasizing areas of agreement\u2014and usually issuing a list of sector-specific market-opening pledges from China. It was also a contrast with the more amicable joint statement given by Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi during an April Florida summit where they agreed to launch a \u201cComprehensive Economic Dialogue.\u201d\u201cMany expected at the 100-day point we would have much more substantive points of progress,\u201d said       Nicholas Lardy,        a China scholar at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He added that the lack of agreement on even modest measures is a sign that U.S.-China relations \u201care very uncertain and subject to very high risks.\u201dPeople familiar with the talks said a major sticking point was a demand from the American negotiators to craft a concrete plan, with benchmarks and a timetable, for reducing China\u2019s trade surplus with the U.S.\u201cThe administration wanted to put some numerical targets in place and I know China was uncomfortable with that,\u201d said       Myron Brilliant,        the U.S. Chamber of Commerce vice president of international affairs.More than his predecessors, Mr. Trump has focused not just on removing barriers to American exports, but on trying to curb America\u2019s trade deficit, which he has said is a concrete sign of flawed policies. Many economists say Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on trade deficits with individual countries is ill-conceived because deficits are driven in large part by macroeconomic factors beyond the control of trade negotiators, like national saving and investment patterns.Chinese Vice Premier       Wang Yang,        who headed his delegation, opened Wednesday\u2019s talks by saying that the economic teams from both countries \u201chave worked around the clock and have held over 60 rounds of working consultations\u201d since the Florida summit to prepare for this week\u2019s session. He portrayed those discussions as more \u201cintense\u201d than intricate negotiations surrounding China\u2019s joining the World Trade Organization in 2001.People familiar with the discussions said American negotiators had been optimistic going into the meetings that they could announce some kind of accords on Chinese regulation of data at multinational companies\u2014a major complaint of U.S. firms doing business there\u2014easing restrictions on foreign auto makers, curbing Chinese agricultural subsidies, and addressing Chinese steel overcapacity.The stall in economic talks mirrors a similarly rough patch in the Trump administration\u2019s diplomatic ties with Beijing. In the weeks since the Mar-a-Lago summit, Mr. Trump rebuffed Chinese objections in approving news arms sales to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province, and sent bombers and naval patrols this month to the South China Sea to assert American freedom to navigate those contested waters. Mr. Trump also tightened economic sanctions against companies and banks allegedly doing businesses aiding North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.The North Korea issue in particular may affect Mr. Trump\u2019s economic approach to China. The president said earlier that he would give China some leeway on trade in return for Beijing\u2019s help curbing Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions. He has since said he was disappointed with China\u2019s efforts, which may make him feel freer to yield the trade club.\u201cIn terms of North Korea, our strength is trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week.Beijing hadn\u2019t been likely to grant major concessions to Washington even without recent irritants in the relationship, according to       Huo Jianguo,        a former Chinese trade official turned researcher.\u201cLarge gaps still exist between the U.S. and China in terms of their economic interests, and there\u2019s little consensus on an approach toward bridging those differences,\u201d said Mr. Huo, vice chairman of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies. \u201cBoth sides still need to time to adjust their mentalities.\u201dThe Trump team early on expressed optimism that it had found a new formula for solving nettlesome trade tensions where prior administrations had failed. In May, as part of a quick down payment, the two governments announced agreement on Chinese market-opening measures in agriculture and finance, with a Chinese pledge to deliver concrete results before this week\u2019s meetings.But some U.S. business groups and affected companies have complained that while China has met the letter of its pledges, it has failed to live up to the spirit of them, removing the promised trade barriers, while leaving other impediments in place.A new tiff flared up this week when             Dow Chemical Co.       said China had appeared to renege on a promise to provide an expedited review of its genetically modified soybean crops as part of the May pledge to accelerate approval of eight stalled biotechnology products.The Chinese government said there had been a misunderstanding and that the Dow product hadn\u2019t been on its priority clearance list.Some American business leaders worry that the stalled talks could create new uncertainty and instability in bilateral economic ties.\u201cWe are disappointed the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue ended at an apparent impasse,\u201d       John Frisbie,        president of the US-China Business Council, said. \u201cIt is important for governments to take tangible steps to address longstanding issues and ensure the commercial relationship remains a source of stability in the overall relationship.\u201d\u2014Jacob Bunge in Chicago and Chun Han Wong in Beijing contributed to this article.Write to Jacob M.

The sit-down would mark Mr. Kushner\u2019s first time speaking with congressional investigators.\u201cAs Mr. Kushner has been saying since March, he has been and is prepared to voluntarily cooperate and provide whatever information he has on the investigations to Congress,\u201d said       Abbe Lowell,        Mr. Kushner\u2019s attorney, in a statement. \u201cWorking with and being responsive to the schedules of the committees, we have arranged Mr. Kushner\u2019s interview with the Senate for July 24. He will continue to cooperate and appreciates the opportunity to assist in putting this matter to rest.\u201dPresident Donald Trump has expressed skepticism about U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Moscow sought to intervene during the campaign. Russian officials have denied doing so. Mr. Trump and his campaign aides have denied any collusion with Moscow.The Senate Judiciary Committee said the younger Mr. Trump and Mr. Manafort would appear next Wednesday in an open hearing.Jason Maloni,        a spokesman for Mr. Manafort, said he had received the request for Mr. Manafort to testify \u201cin the last 25 minutes\u201d and said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking it over.\u201d He declined to confirm that Mr. Manafort would testify.A spokesman for the president\u2019s eldest son didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The younger Mr. Trump has also said he was willing to cooperate with the congressional committees.They would be speaking on a panel alongside       William Browder,        a hedge-fund manager turned human-rights advocate who has campaigned on behalf of the Magnitsky Act, and       Glenn Simpson,        a former Wall Street Journal reporter who runs a research firm linked to a dossier containing unverified allegations that the president had ties to Russian leaders. The Magnitsky Act is a 2012 U.S. law that punishes Russian officials accused of human-rights violations, and is named for Mr. Browder\u2019s lawyer, who died in a Russian jail in 2009.The testimony from the younger Mr. Trump and Mr. Manafort is expected to focus in part on an email chain Mr. Trump released last week showing he helped arrange a Trump Tower meeting to discuss allegedly damaging information about former Democratic presidential nominee       Hillary Clinton.       The meeting was also attended by Messrs. Kushner and Manafort.A Russian attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya, who also attended the meeting, has said she used the gathering to advocate against the Magnitsky Act. Ms. Veselnitskaya has been a longtime critic of Mr. Browder.Sen.       Dianne Feinstein       of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday she had been informed that special counsel       Robert Mueller,        who is conducting a criminal probe of Russia\u2019s actions during the election and any Trump campaign ties to them, had raised no objections to calling the attendees of the meeting before the panel.Mr. Mueller has contacted the eighth attendee at the Trump Tower meeting,       Ike Kaveladze,        the attendee\u2019s lawyer said Tuesday, marking the first public sign that the special-counsel probe will examine the June 2016 gathering.While members of the Trump administration, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, have testified before Senate panels as part of the Russia probe, next week\u2019s planned interviews show the inquiry is extending to some people closest to the president, including two of his family members.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "news_title": "Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort to Speak to Senate Panels", "keywords": " russian meddling, senate intelligence committee,trump campaign,Jared Kushner,Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house"}]
