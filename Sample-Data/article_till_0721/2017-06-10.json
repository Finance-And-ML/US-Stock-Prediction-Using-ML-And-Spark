[{"content": "BEIJING\u2014The Chinese government took its campaign against an exiled businessman and critic of the Communist Party to a courtroom Friday, putting his subordinates on trial for fraud.The proceedings marked the first time Chinese authorities officially aired allegations involving Guo Wengui, who has rattled Beijing in recent months by unleashing a torrent of colorful tales of corrupt ties between China\u2019s business elites and some of the party\u2019s most senior officials.China\u2019s government has described       Mr. Guo       as a criminal and a fugitive and asked Interpol to issue a so-called red notice for his arrest. However, the government has declined to comment on reports in local media detailing his alleged misdeeds, including bribery of a top security official who, these reports said, later helped Mr. Guo use a sex tape to take down Beijing\u2019s vice mayor.Mr. Guo, who lives in New York, wasn\u2019t named as a defendant in the trial, which was held in the northeastern city of Dalian.Prosecutors claimed that three executives of Mr. Guo\u2019s company, Beijing Pangu Investment Co., fabricated documents such as construction contracts to obtain $3.2 billion yuan ($471 million) in loans from Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. that were taken out in 2010 and repaid in 2014, according to a transcript posted on an official court social-media account.Two of the executives were also accused of using faked invoices to transfer $13.5 million out of the country in 2012 to purchase a private airplane for Mr. Guo. All three confessed to the crimes, saying they had committed them under Mr. Guo\u2019s direction, according to the transcript.Reached after the trial concluded, Mr. Guo declined to comment on the allegations.In a video interview posted online Thursday night by Mingjing, a U.S.-based Chinese news outlet, he said details described in court documents were \u201cnot at all the same as what I remember.\u201dDalian Xigang People\u2019s Court, which heard the case, went to unusual lengths to open the proceedings to public view, posting videos of testimony in addition to the transcripts. Reuters reported the court also allowed one of its reporters to view a video feed of the trial from a room inside the courthouse--an almost unheard-of level of access for foreign media.These measures helped Chinese authorities lend weight to the portrayal of Mr. Guo as corrupt in a series of recent local media articles and YouTube videos. In one video, one of the executives on trial Friday said Mr. Guo ordered her to fake documents.Mr. Guo has dismissed such accounts as attempts to discredit his own corruption allegations.In brief comments to the Wall Street Journal on Friday, Mr. Guo said he expected the court would try to publicize the allegations against him widely. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised, not surprised at all. It\u2019s obvious what they\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he said, without elaborating.The court didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. It wasn\u2019t clear when a verdict would be issued.A businessman\u2019s path to exile and the internetMr. Guo, a real-estate tycoon who also goes by the name       Miles Kwok,        said he left China in 2014 after receiving a tip that one of his \u201cbenefactors\u201d was about to be arrested. Lately, he has developed a large following online with his claims of misdeeds involving prominent Chinese companies and officials. He hasn\u2019t provided evidence to support his allegations.Corruption allegations from a member of the Chinese business elite are rare, and Mr. Guo\u2019s gambit comes at a particularly sensitive time, months before a major leadership shuffle that Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to use to solidify power. One of the officials Mr. Guo has targeted is       Wang Qishan,        the party\u2019s top corruption buster and a close ally of       Mr. Xi\u2019s      .Mr. Wang       didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Videos posted by the Dalian court had racked up hundreds of thousands of views by Friday afternoon. Several social-media users posted messages on the court\u2019s official feed portraying Mr. Guo as a force for justice, while others accused the businessman of using his whistleblowing as a way to protect his own interests.Additional trials are expected involving Pangu and Zhengquan Holdings Co., another of Mr. Guo\u2019s companies, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. People affiliated with those companies are under investigation for a range of offenses including bribery, embezzlement, destruction of financial records and kidnapping, it said.Chinese real-estate titan       Pan Shiyi,        the chairman of SOHO China Ltd., filed a defamation lawsuit against Mr. Guo in New York last week after Mr. Guo accused       Mr. Pan       of being a \u201cwhite-glove\u201d agent for corrupt officials by holding shares in his company for them.\u201cThere is not a word of truth in the vile language and rumors he\u2019s directed at us,\u201d Mr. Pan said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.Mr. Guo responded on             Twitter,       saying he was looking forward to seeing what documents might be revealed as a result of the lawsuit. \u201cEverything is just getting started!\u201d he wrote.Write to Josh Chin at josh.chin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-10 23:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-cranks-up-heat-on-exiled-tycoon-guo-wengui-1497006242", "news_title": "China Cranks Up Heat on Exiled Tycoon Guo Wengui", "keywords": " billionaire, china, chinese, exile, fraud,guo wengui, hearing, subordinates, trial, tycoon,Mr. Guo,political,general news,crime,legal action,fraud,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "KABUL\u2014An Afghan commando turned his weapon on U.S. forces in eastern Afghanistan, killing three American soldiers and wounding one who is in critical condition, Afghan and coalition officials said Saturday.The shooting took place in Achin district of Nangarhar province, where a joint U.S. and Afghan operation to dislodge Islamic State fighters from their stronghold in the mountains there has been under way for months.Several U.S. and Afghan soldiers have been killed in the push to drive Islamic State out of villages that it had occupied in the area years previously. Fleeing Islamic State fighters are now holed up in the mountains there, where the U.S. military in April dropped the largest non-nuclear weapon in its arsenal ever on an Islamic State cave-and-tunnel complex.The Pentagon issued a brief statement that confirmed the casualties and said the incident is under investigation.The U.S. military in Afghanistan didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. A coalition official said the U.S. soldiers belonged to the 101st Airborne division, which historically specializes in parachuting into enemy territory, and in recent times is known for carrying out air assaults by helicopter.\u201cThe Afghan commando was killed by other forces on the ground who responded to the attack,\u201d said Attaullah Khogyany, a spokesman for the provincial governor in Nangarhar.The Taliban issued a statement claiming to have killed four U.S. soldiers in the same area in an \u201cinsider attack.\u201dAfghan soldiers frequently turn their weapons on their U.S. and Afghan allies, and the Taliban often claim such attackers are members of the insurgency that have infiltrated Afghan forces.Earlier in the day, Afghan officials said a U.S. airstrike killed at least two Afghan policemen and wounded three others in southern Helmand province, in the latest friendly fire incident in the south where the Taliban are closing in on the provincial capital.The U.S. military said it was investigating the incident and expressed regret for the deaths.The incident occurred late Friday night when an American military aircraft opened fire on Afghan border police in a joint overnight operation against militants in Nad Ali district of the province, said Omar Zwak, a spokesman for the provincial governor of Helmand.\u201cThe U.S. forces were asked by forces on the ground for air support but it mistakenly hit members of the Afghan border police,\u201d said Mr. Zwak, adding that the government is investigating the airstrike.The U.S. military command in Kabul confirmed the incident, saying an \u201cinvestigation is being conducted at this time to determine the specific circumstances\u201d that resulted in the deaths and injuries to members of the Afghan border police.Friendly-fire incidents aren\u2019t uncommon in the Afghan conflict and have caused casualties to both the U.S. forces and their Afghan counterparts as they battle extremist groups across the country.Two U.S. soldiers were killed likely by friendly fire during a late-night operation in April while battling Islamic State in eastern Afghanistan.In 2015, U.S. troops\u2019 friendly fire led to the killing of at least 17 members of the counter-narcotics police in Helmand province. A year later, in neighboring Uruzgan province, friendly fire by American military aircraft killed eight Afghan policemen.The Taliban have expanded their territory in Helmand province, capturing many districts and closing in on the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. The deteriorating security situation in the province has led to the redeployment of hundreds of U.S. marines, after their full withdrawal in 2014.There are currently 8,500 American troops in the country, along with 6,500 troops representing members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.Besides training and advisory, the U.S. Special Forces conduct counterterrorism missions along with their Afghan counterparts.In recent weeks following the Taliban spring offensive, Afghanistan has witnessed a string of violent attacks, including a truck bombing late last month in the Afghan capital that killed scores of people.Write to Jessica Donati at Jessica.Donati@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-10 23:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/afghan-policemen-killed-by-u-s-airstrike-in-latest-friendly-fire-incident-1497102955", "news_title": "Three U.S. Soldiers Killed by Afghan Commando", "keywords": "afghan, afghanistan, helmand,nangarhar,taliban,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,murder,manslaughter,risk news,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "ELMONT, N.Y.\u2014After winning the Kentucky Derby with Always Dreaming five weeks ago, trainer       Todd Pletcher       was always hoping to cap off the Triple Crown season with a victory at his base of Belmont Park.Pletcher got his wish, but the garland of white carnations went to a different horse than he had initially expected.With a strong closing run, the Pletcher-trained Tapwrit overtook Irish War Cry in the stretch to win Saturday\u2019s Belmont Stakes by two lengths. Patch, another horse trained by Pletcher, finished third.Gormley finished fourth, followed by Senior Investment, Twisted Tom, Lookin At Lee, Meantime, J Boys Echo and Multiplier. Hollywood Handsome was eased after clipping heels with another horse, causing jockey       Florent Geroux       to lose his footing in his stirrups.\u201cWe were hoping [Tapwrit] had enough when it came to crunch time,\u201d Pletcher said. \u201cIt looked like Irish War Cry still had a little something left, but the last 16th [of a mile], he dug down deep.\u201dCoincidentally, it was Irish War Cry\u2019s awkward break in the starting gate at Churchill Downs during the Derby that Pletcher said cost Tapwrit all chance to win. Breaking from gate 17, Irish War Cry angled sharply to his left and bumped into Taprwrit (in gate 16), causing a chain reaction that affected several horses that day. Tapwrit finished sixth.Pletcher skipped the Preakness with Tapwrit and gave his horse a break after the Derby to prepare for the grueling 1 \u00bd-mile distance of the Belmont.\u201cWe felt like with the five weeks in between, and with the way this horse had trained, that he had a legitimate chance,\u201d Pletcher said.Saturday\u2019s race had lost a little bit of luster, after Pletcher opted to keep Always Dreaming in the barn after the colt finished eighth in the Preakness. The connections of Cloud Computing, the winner of that race, also opted not to run. Classic Empire, last year\u2019s juvenile champion, was slated to enter but was withdrawn earlier in the week due to a foot abscess, while the Japanese horse Epicharis, who was considered a strong contender, was scratched on Saturday morning due to inflammation in the horse\u2019s right front.Nonetheless, 57,729 fans turned out at Belmont Park and saw Irish War Cry jump out to the early lead, tracked closely by Meantime. Jockey       Jose Ortiz,        riding Tapwrit, was content to track the pacesetters from a few lengths back.\u201cThe distance, I was sure he could handle it,\u2019\u2019 Ortiz said.With Irish War Cry still in the lead at the top of the stretch, Ortiz urged his mount and Tapwrit found another gear to overtake his rival.Tapwrit, a son of North America\u2019s leading sire Tapit, covered the 1 \u00bd-mile race in a final time of 2:30:02. A $2 win bet on Tapwrit paid $12.60.The win was the third time in the last four years that a son of Tapit won the Belmont Stakes. Tonalist (2014) and Creator (2016) were the previous Belmont winners.Michael Hernon,        the director of sales at the Lexington, Ky.-based Gainesway, where Tapit currently stands at stud, recently explained why Tapit is a much-sought stallion.\u201cWhen you buy a yearling by Tapit, you have a chance to have a good horse,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal in an April interview.Tapwrit was purchased for $1.2 million at the Fasig-Tipton sales in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in Aug. 2015.Bridlewood Farm, led by       John Malone,        the chairman of             Liberty Media Corp.      , co-owns Tapwrit, along with Eclipse Thoroughbred Partners and       Robert LaPenta.       With the win, the connections earned $800,000 of the $1.5 million purse.Although he didn\u2019t have a runner in the Belmont Stakes, it was also a big day for trainer       Bob Baffert.       Baffert saddled four winners on Saturday\u2019s undercard, with West Coast taking the Easy Goer Stakes, Abel Tasman winning the Acorn and American Anthem cruising in the Woody Stephens and Mor Spirit dominating the Met Mile. All four horses were ridden by jockey       Mike Smith.\u201cSmith and Baffert\u2014unbeatable!\u201d track announcer       Larry Collmus       proclaimed after Mor Spirit crossed the finish line.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on a big day,\u201d Baffert said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to embarrass a good horse on a big day.\u201dWrite to Jim Chairusmi at jim.chairusmi@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-10 20:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tapwrit-wins-the-belmont-stakes-1497138230", "news_title": "Tapwrit Wins the Belmont Stakes   ", "keywords": "belmont raceway,belmont stakes,garland of carnations,horse racing,triple crown,Todd Pletcher,harness racing,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "BERLIN\u2014An             easyJet                   PLC plane traveling to London Stansted Airport from Ljubljana, Slovenia, on Saturday night diverted and made a sudden landing in Cologne, Germany, amid suspicions three men on board posed a threat to the aircraft, German police said.The three men were arrested and being interrogated at police headquarters early Sunday morning, according to a spokesman for the state police in North Rhine-Westphalia.

BA 1.27%       said Saturday it had moved a step closer to completing a contentious jetliner sale to an Iranian airline, though the U.S. government still needs to give the green light before planes could be delivered.Boeing said it had signed a final purchase agreement with Iran Aseman Airlines for up to 60 737 Max single-aisle planes, its newest model. The two parties earlier this year announced a memorandum of agreement for the transaction that could be valued at up to $6 billion at list price, though buyers typically get discounts.Boeing, the world\u2019s No. 1 plane maker, and European rival Airbus SE have signed multibillion-dollar deals with Iranian carriers to sell planes after foreign powers lifted many economic sanctions last year in exchange for restrictions on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. Iran has a fleet of aging planes after years of sanctions.Even as European countries have rushed to Iran to establish business ties after nuclear sanctions were lifted, U.S. companies have largely held back, unsure about whether President       Donald Trump      \u2014a sharp critic of the nuclear deal on the campaign trail\u2014would try to alter the pact or otherwise discourage closer business ties.Congressional critics of easing ties with Iran have opposed the plane sales and sought ways to stop the deals. They accuse Iran of using planes to help support terrorism, an accusation Tehran denies.Airbus and European turboprop maker ATR this year started delivering airliners to Iran Air, the country\u2019s flag carrier. Airbus last year agreed to sell 100 planes to the state-owned airline. Boeing last year also won a $16.6 billion deal before discounts to sell 80 planes to Iran Air. It is awaiting final approval from the U.S. Treasury for those sales.When Boeing announced the agreement with Aseman Air in April, it was the first major deal put forward between a U.S. company and an Iranian one since Mr. Trump took office.Boeing Saturday said it had applied to the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control for approval of a license to see the deal through.

About three dozen civilians were killed in the attacks, with about the same number wounded, according to officials from a local hospital.Iraq\u2019s central government said some 150 militants were killed in ground fighting and by airstrikes as Iraqi security forces repelled the attack after hours of fighting. Five members of the Iraqi forces died in the clash, according to local officials.\u201cIt was a crazy attack that we never expected before,\u201d said       Ali al-Dodah,        mayor of Shirqat, confirming that dozens of militants were killed. \u201cNow things are under control.\u201dIslamic State still has outposts in the Makhoul Mountains east of Shirqat. The villages that were attacked sit between the mountain range and the town. There was no immediate reason given for this particular attack.Elsewhere on Saturday, Iraqi troops killed three men wearing suicide vests as they tried to sneak by boat to the al-Othaim Dam in Diyala province, northeast of Baghdad, according to the military\u2019s media office.The attacks near Mosul come the day after suicide attacks on the Shiite holy town of Karbala and nearby Musayeb killed about 21 people and injured dozens more, according to Iraqi officials. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks.\u201cTerrorists have no religion and no morals,\u201d said a representative of Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah       Ali al-Sistani       in a sermon Friday. \u201cThis is why terrorists resort to whatever is in their hands to kill innocent people.\u201dIslamic State has launched several attacks across Iraq during the holy month of Ramadan, in one instance killing dozens of people after the extremists targeted families gathered at a popular Baghdad ice-cream parlor.The militant group, meanwhile, has been pushed back in its urban stronghold of Mosul, where U.S.-backed Iraqi troops have boxed them into the Old City. In the past week, Iraqi forces have slogged out a block-by-block fight with the militants, taking heavy casualties as they attempt to manage the thousands of civilians in the city who are still trapped and being used as human shields.Write to Ben Kesling at benjamin.kesling@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-10 16:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/militants-attack-villages-south-of-mosul-1497127819", "news_title": "Militants Attack Villages South of Mosul", "keywords": "iraq attack,isil,isis,islamic militants,islamic state,islamic state of iraq ,mosul attack,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,risk news,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "When             Electronic Arts Inc.        EA 1.18%       releases the sequel to \u201cStar Wars Battlefront\u201d this fall, it plans to ditch one lucrative sales pipeline for another that is potentially even bigger, refined in mobile videogames.Instead of selling regular \u201cexpansion packs\u201d\u2014the quests, maps and other content sold separately after launch\u2014Electronic Arts will send customers free smaller packs more frequently, a way to keep them playing \u201cStar Wars Battlefront II\u201d indefinitely.To replace lost expansion-pack revenue, Electronic Arts plans to use microtransactions to sell low-cost virtual goods. Microtransactions including those sold within free-to-play mobile games have reaped billions of dollars for the videogame industry.Spending on microtransactions across all game platforms reached $71 billion world-wide last year, up from $62.4 billion in 2015, according to SuperData Research. Relatively new for console games, microtransactions brought in $2.2 billion last year, compared with $1.4 billion for expansion packs, the industry tracker said.\u201cMicrotransactions are now the most profitable part of many publishers\u2019 businesses,\u201d Jefferies analyst       Tim O\u2019Shea       said.The first \u201cStar Wars Battlefront,\u201d released in 2015, sold 14 million copies. Buyers could purchase up to four $20 packs of extra content every few months, or buy them all ahead of time in a $50 \u201cseason pass.\u201dElectronic Arts doesn\u2019t break out sales of add-ons for individual games. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter estimates \u201cBattlefront\u201d made about $200 million off them.\u201cBattlefront II\u201d is among the games expected to generate buzz at Electronic Entertainment Expo, better known as E3, which starts June 13 in Los Angeles. Others include             Nintendo Co.\u2019s       \u201cSuper Mario Odyssey,\u201d a new installment of             Ubisoft Entertainment SA\u2019s       \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed\u201d and a sequel to             Activision Blizzard\u2019s       \u201cDestiny.\u201dElectronic Arts plans to tease \u201cBattlefront II\u201d on Saturday ahead of the trade show. The game will sell \u201ccrates\u201d of virtual cards that enhance characters\u2019 appearance and abilities. Similar to packs of baseball cards, they contain a blind mix of common and rare cards.Other changes are coming with \u201cBattlefront II.\u201d The sequel will include a fan-requested single-player storyline and bigger space battles. This time, the game will span all three Star Wars film eras. Electronic Arts said it will tweak the rules as often as weekly based on player behavior.\u201cWe changed our approach to a live service,\u201d Matt Webster, executive producer of the game, told The Wall Street Journal ahead of E3. \u201cIt is a continual commitment to engage with our players.\u201dIt\u2019s possible Electronic Arts could sell additional expansion-pack-like content down the road, but the company said it currently has no plans to do so.The problem with expansion packs is not everyone buys them, and that creates friction between players, Benchmark Co. analyst Mike Hickey said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t pay and your friend does, you can\u2019t play together,\u201d he said.Removing such obstacles keeps players engaged longer, and that could lead to a greater opportunity for revenue growth, Electronic Arts said.The games that end up most successful will be those that do the best job of engaging players, said       Doug Creutz,        an analyst at Cowen & Co. \u201cThe more they play, the more they\u2019re going to spend,\u201d he said.Microtransactions are common in free mobile games such as \u201cClash of Clans,\u201d where players can buy virtual coins to spend inside the game. Their popularity has nudged publishers to add the enhancement to games played using consoles such as             Sony Corp.\u2019s       PlayStation, even though many games already cost $60.When Activision Blizzard Inc. released \u201cOverwatch\u201d last May, it eschewed expansion packs in favor of microtransactions. The game remains a player favorite more than a year after launch.Keith Maber, a 27-year-old hospitality worker, occasionally buys virtual \u201cloot crates\u201d in \u201cOverwatch.\u201d He recently spent about $15 on several that had special character costumes to commemorate the game\u2019s anniversary. \u201cIt is definitely about the thrill of not knowing what you\u2019re going to get,\u201d Mr. Maber said.\u201cBattlefront II\u201d won\u2019t be Electronic Arts\u2019 first venture into microtransactions. Ultimate Team, a mode in the company\u2019s sports franchises such as FIFA soccer, generated about $800 million last year from sales of virtual playing cards.\u201cWith a live service, you can watch how people play and you can change how you engage with them based on what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Webster said.Appeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'For Console Game, a Mobile Pitch.'", "news_time": "2017-06-10 16:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-ii-electronic-arts-shifts-revenue-strategy-1497124800", "news_title": "EA Hopes \u2018Star Wars Battlefront II\u2019 Microtransactions Can Shift Revenue to Hyperspace ", "keywords": "e3 2017,electronic entertainment expo,expansion packs,microtransactions,revenue,star wars videogames,strategy,videogame,xbox,Electronic Arts,EA,Activision Blizzard,ATVI,Nintendo,7974.TO,Sony,6758.TO,SNE,Ubisoft Entertainment,UBI.FR,Tim O'Shea,Doug Creutz,Keith Maber,Mario Odyssey,Matt Webster,Michael Pachter,Mike Hickey,plans,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,computing,games software,technology"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014One of the most entertaining things in tennis is watching a talented player totally go for it -- as in, throw out every trace of fear or trepidation or caution, snuggle up to risk and recklessness, and let the racket and the aggression fly.It\u2019s fun and liberated, but it\u2019s also a dangerous way to play. This is why so few professional players do it, or worse, they go for it halfway, trying to straddle some sort of invisible border between careful and crazy, which is conflicted and basically never works.Totally going for it also seldom works. But when it does, it is thrilling to watch, as it was Saturday at the French Open women\u2019s singles final, where an unseeded 20-year-old named       Jelena Ostapenko       of Latvia won her first major \u2014 and her first Tour-level pro tournament, ever \u2014 by playing fearless and often ruthless tennis to beat third-seed       Simona Halep       of Romania, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.\u201cI have no words,\u201d Ostapenko said when the nearly two-hour match was over. \u201cIt was my dream.\u201dThis 2017 French Open was destined to be a bit unpredictable on the women\u2019s side, with       Serena Williams       out of tennis and awaiting her first child, and two-time winner       Maria Sharapova       returned from a drug suspension but was denied a wild-card entry. Defending champion Garbine Muguruza fell in the Round of 16, as did the resurgent       Venus Williams,        and by the end of the fourth round, all of the tournament\u2019s prior Grand Slam winners had been eliminated.It may have caused a star deficit, but it was intriguing: Whoever wound up winning the women\u2019s title at Roland Garros would be a first-time Slam winner, a fresh star crowned.As it turned out, the fresh star turned out to be a virtual unknown. Ostapenko, a former pro ballroom dancer, turned 20 on June 8, and came to Paris ranked 47 in the world on the women\u2019s tour. She\u2019s now the first unseeded women\u2019s singles champ at the French Open since 1933. There\u2019s also this pleasant bit of symmetry: Ostapenko\u2019s the first player to win his or her first-ever Tour-level tournament at Roland Garros since clay court legend Gustavo Kuerten, who won the first of his three on the day of Ostapenko\u2019s birth, two decades ago.Ostapenko had already been a risk-taking handful at this tournament -- before Saturday, she\u2019d stormed back to win three matches after dropping the first set -- and versus Halep, she sent an aggressive message at the start. In the match\u2019s first game, Ostapenko jumped all over Halep\u2019s serve, pounding from the baseline for an easy 0-40 break. A murmur fuzzed around Philippe-Chartier: \u201cIs the new kid going to have that kind of day?\u201dBut Halep would break right back, and hold for the next. A familiar rhythm began to develop: the youngster would bring the force, but the more experienced pro would play smart, withstand the barrage, and capitalize on errors. Halep\u2019s game had less sizzle, but she made far fewer mistakes. Soon it was she who was dictating the terms, and Ostapenko was talking to herself on the clay.After taking the first set, Halep pushed to a 3-0 advantage, and it seemed as if she would be the first-time major winner here \u2014 and also women\u2019s tennis\u2019s new World No. 1.But Ostapenko never wavered with her brash approach. Without a flinch, she stuck with the game that had delivered her here, even when she gave away her serve, or when an overly cranked ground stroke sailed three feet deep or wide. Tentative was not her thing.\u201cIf I have a chance to go for a shot,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201dTo the delight of the sold-out stadium, Ostapenko rallied back from that 3-0 deficit to take the second set and knot the match. As the third set began, she didn\u2019t show nerves or even a touch of carefulness. She maintained the Full Jelena, hitting ferocious strokes that continued to kiss the lines -- as well as a few that scattered long or wide -- and Halep couldn\u2019t match the fury.Ostapenko finished with 54 winners to go along with 54 unforced errors. Like the men\u2019s finalist Stan Wawrinka, she thrives when she lets it fly. For perspective, Rafael Nadal had 23 winners and 22 unforced errors in his three-set semi win over Dominic Thiem on Friday.When it was over, Ostapenko knew what to do despite her inexperience, jubilantly tossing her racket into the air. With no youthful apprehension, she\u2019d prevailed in a wide-open French Open, announcing herself as a new force in women\u2019s tennis at a moment when women\u2019s tennis could use one. Even if she seemed a little bit in shock as the trophy ceremony began.\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I won Roland Garros,\u201d Ostapenko said.She did win -- because she chose to totally go for it, and did so brilliantly.Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-10 14:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-right-kind-of-reckless-and-a-french-open-title-1497118291", "news_title": "The Right Kind of Reckless\u2014and a French Open Title", "keywords": " france,french open,grand slam,jason gay, jelena ostapenko, latvia,simona halep, sports, tennis,tennis tournament,Jelena Ostapenko,Simona Halep,sports,recreation,tennis,commentaries,opinions,routine general news"}, {"content": "President       Donald Trump       next week will make expansion of apprenticeship programs the center of his labor policy, aimed at filling a record level of open jobs and drawing back Americans who have left the workforce.Apprenticeships are an underused form of workforce training in the U.S. compared with European countries and have a proven record of good outcomes for workers, administration officials said. Nine in 10 Americans who complete apprentice training land a job, and their average starting salary is $60,000 a year, according to the Labor Department.The administration is committed to \u201csupporting working families and creating a pathway for them to have robust and successful careers,\u201d       Ivanka Trump,        the president\u2019s daughter and assistant, said Friday. \u201cThere has been great focus on four-year higher education, and in reality, that is not the right path for everyone.\"White House officials discussing the president\u2019s goals on Friday gave few details on program changes or requests to Congress. They said Mr. Trump is likely to offer more specifics in the coming days. He plans to visit a technical school in Wisconsin on Tuesday and deliver a policy speech at the Labor Department on Wednesday.Apprenticeship programs are typically partnerships between a school and an employer, which federal or state governments certify. Workers are trained for skills businesses need and provided hands-on experience. Since workers are paid while they learn, programs can attract younger Americans seeking to avoid student debt and displaced older workers who need new skills but can\u2019t attend years of college.Such programs could also address an emerging shortage of skilled workers. There were more than six million job openings in April, the Labor Department reported Tuesday, the highest level recorded since the government started tracking the figure at the end of 2000. At the same time, the share of Americans participating in the workforce is trending near a four-decade low.\u201cClosing the skills gap is critical for increasing labor-force participation,\u201d Labor Secretary       Alexander Acosta       said Friday. If workers see a pathway to gaining skills and taking high-paying jobs, the argument goes, they\u2019re more likely to remain in or return to the workforce.There were more than 505,000 apprentices in training in fiscal year 2016, the Labor Department said. That was the highest level on record back to 2001, but only about 20,000 higher than the previous peak in 2003. And the figure is much smaller than the 13.3 million students enrolled in four-year colleges last year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.Before running for president, Mr. Trump was the host of NBC\u2019s reality television show \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d A senior White House official said the show didn\u2019t inspire the policy push. Rather, the president\u2019s interest stems from his background in the construction industry, where apprenticeship programs are common. But the official noted the television program effectively showed the value of mentorships, which is an important attribute of apprenticeship programs.Of the more than 8,000 active apprenticeship programs registered with the Labor Department, almost half are in the construction industry and 20% are in manufacturing. However, an official said, apprenticeships are in use or under consideration in fields ranging from policing to retail, and the intent is to expand programs to more industries.Apprentice programs were also a priority of the Obama administration. The Labor Department distributed $90 million in grants last year specially appropriated for apprenticeship expansion. The current administration sees the programs as advantageous because they\u2019re largely funded by the firms where workers receive training or by labor unions, and they could be expanded without significant additional federal outlays.Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposed to keep funding for apprentice programs steady but reduce funding for Labor Department job-training programs by nearly 40%.\u201cContinuing existing investment in apprentices is not going make up for the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed to be cut from larger job-training programs,\u201d said       Seth Harris,        the deputy labor secretary under President       Barack Obama.       \u201cThose cuts would result in tens of thousands of worker not receiving job-placement and training services.\u201dMany large businesses have existing programs to provide on-the-job training but not all are federally registered apprenticeships.Defense firm             Northrop Grumman                   has programs with two state universities in Maryland to train workers in cybersecurity. Chief Executive       Wes Bush       said businesses need the government\u2019s help to expand training programs, especially because smaller firms don\u2019t have the capacity to offer such programs, but face the same shortage of skilled workers.\u201cOur nation\u2019s economic growth is directly linked to the skills of today\u2019s workers,\u201d he said in a speech to the Business Roundtable trade group Wednesday. \u201cUnfortunately, the skills of many new and existing workers have not kept up with the requirements of current and future jobs.\u201dWrite to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-10 14:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-plan-to-build-the-u-s-workforce-apprenticeship-1497117600", "news_title": "You\u2019re Hired: Trump Plans to Build U.S. Workforce With Apprenticeships ", "keywords": " apprentice, apprentice programs, apprenticeship, job openings, labor issues, skills gap, worker stills, worker training,workforce training,Ivanka Trump,Donald Trump,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,employee training,development,political,general news,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,domestic politics,television,radio,government bodies,executive branch,labor department,media"}, {"content": "The French Open that was the toughest to predict in women\u2019s tennis history had a fitting winner: Jelena Ostapenko, a 20-year-old from Latvia who had never been past the third round of a Grand Slam and had never won a title of any kind.Ostapenko trailed       Simona Halep,        the 25-year-old tennis star, by a set and 3-0 when she came roaring back to take the second set. In third set, she trailed again\u2014and came back again. She ended the match in style, a thumped backhand winner off Halep\u2019s serve for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory. It was the 54th winner she hit in the match. Halep hit just eight.Ostapenko smiled, jumped and pumped her fists after her victory. She is the first Latvian to win a Grand Slam title.\u00a0After entering the tournament ranked 47th in the world, she will be ranked No. 12 as of\u00a0Monday.\u201cI really love to be here. Everything is amazing,\u201d she said.The Open was wide open from the start, largely because       Serena Williams,        the American champion, is missing the rest of the season because of pregnancy. Anyone could have won the event, and the results were unpredictable from the first round.That happened in the final, too. Halep had won the first set and was up three games to none in the second when Ostapenko began slamming more winners and missing fewer shots. Suddenly, she had won the set and made Halep look disappointed and nervous.Halep\u2019s recent rise came after a brief split with coach       Darren Cahill,        the former pro and coach for       Andre Agassi.       Cahill was so disgusted with Halep\u2019s attitude earlier this year that he temporarily split with her. Halep, disappointed, changed her approach and has since excelled. At this tournament, she even survived a physical concern, a torn ankle ligament in Rome last month.\u00a0She said a fiercer attitude has made a huge difference.\u201cI\u2019m [a] different player,\u201d Halep said leading up to the final. \u201cI play better tennis. I move better. And I think Darren gave me many advices, technical, and I play better tennis like opening the court, thinking more, doing much more with the ball.\u201dBut she couldn\u2019t resolve her nerves, or Ostapenko\u2019s power, late in the match. Ostapenko\u2014aggressive and relentless\u2014hit 54 winners and made 54 unforced errors. Halep\u2014faster and steadier with more spin\u2014had just eight winners and 10 unforced errors.Wildest of all: The serve was a disadvantage. Ostapenko, whose second serve is slow and casually placed, lost her serve six times. Halep, not know for a dominant serve, was thumped even more by Ostapenko\u2019s returns. She lost her serve eight of 19 times and only won 30% of her second serves.\u201cI want to congratulate Jelena,\u201d Halep said. \u201cHopefully, I can play another final here in the future to win it.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-10 12:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/latvias-jelena-ostapenko-wins-first-grand-slam-title-at-french-open-1497112323", "news_title": "Latvia\u2019s Jelena Ostapenko Wins First Grand Slam Title at French Open ", "keywords": " france,french open, jelena ostapenko,latvia,romania, serena williams, simona halep, tennis, tennis tournament,Ms. Ostapenko,Simona Halep,sports,recreation,tennis,routine general news"}, {"content": "When Don Winslow was interviewing police officers for his new novel, \u201cThe Force,\u201d he recalls some of the cops telling wild stories and laughing till they cried. Other memories would make them weep.\u201cWhen you talk to them in the wee hours of the morning,\u201d Mr. Winslow says, \u201cyou really get how much they care.\u201dBut in \u201cThe Force,\u201d Mr. Winslow\u2019s tale of police corruption, cops on the job display the more familiar veneer of cynicism and detachment. He says it\u2019s a defense mechanism for the rigors of their work.Critics and crime-writing royalty have anointed his 496-page opus, which will be published June 20, an epic summer read. According to Lee Child, \u201cThe Force\u201d is \u201cprobably the best cop novel ever written.\u201d Stephen King\u2019s take: \u201cThink \u2018The Godfather,\u2019 only with cops.\u201d Mike Lupica wrote in the New York Daily News: \u201cIt isn\u2019t just one of the great New York City cop novels ever written. It is one of the great New York City novels.\u201dMr. Winslow\u2019s protagonist, Denny Malone, is a swaggering New York City detective, a \u201chero cop\u201d in tabloid parlance. Malone cares deeply about the safety of the people on his turf, stretching north from Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side to the Bronx line. He and his partners in an elite unit take some shortcuts, but they get results.\u201cThat was their job and their passion and their love,\u201d Mr. Winslow writes, \u201cand if that meant they worked the corners of the plate and put a little something extra on the ball now and then, that\u2019s what they did.\u201d\u201cA little something extra\u201d can become a lot more. After reading Mr. Winslow\u2019s manuscript, one veteran cop told the author that Malone \u201cis a piece of shit, but I like him.\u201d No one wants dirty cops, Mr. Winslow says, but citizens want to be protected, and they don\u2019t necessarily want to hear the details.One type of corruption, Mr. Winslow says, ranges from comped meals at the local diner to bribes from the mob. Another type includes coddling drug-dealing informants, manhandling suspects or planting evidence, even in the service of nailing a criminal.\u201cThe free sandwich is one thing, because it\u2019s financial\u201d the author says. \u201cThe procedural kind of corruption is much more seductive and much more insidious because you have guys out there trying to do good. And by far most of them are.\u201dPolice stories are often riddled by stereotypical overworked characters beset with drinking problems, fractured marriages and adrenaline addiction\u2014living in an insular culture of cops-only-talk-to-other-cops.Another fixture: bad cops. While researching the book, the 63-year-old Mr. Winslow says, he talked to many cops who resent the current outcry about police shootings, but who privately rage about rogue colleagues who feed their brittle egos with bullying and abuse.\u201cThey\u2019re guys who don\u2019t have enough personal power, so they feel that putting on that uniform gives them \u2018a little brief authority,\u2019 in Shakespeare\u2019s terms,\u201d he says. That has always been this way. \u201cYou could write the story in Latin.\u201dMr. Winslow recognizes these clich\u00e9s. \u201cBut they\u2019re true,\u201d he points out. \u201cI\u2019m aware of them, but they take you where they take you.\u201d It\u2019s a question of execution.Mr. Winslow and his wife have lived in Southern California for more than two decades. He was born in Staten Island, N.Y., raised in Rhode Island and spent years off and on in New York until the early 1990s. While New York may have inspired 1,000 episodes of \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d Southern California has a richer history of crime fiction.For more than 20 years, his subjects were Orange County drug dealers, Mexican cartels and surfing detectives in San Diego County. Among the 20 books he\u2019s written since 1991, the best known are \u201cSavages\u201d and \u201cThe Cartel,\u201d a 2015 best seller that is the second in a planned trilogy about drug lords. The former shows off Mr. Winslow\u2019s profane, crackling wit, the latter his insights into dangerous, closed-off cultures.He points out that until recently, editors and bookstore owners said they couldn\u2019t \u201cbrand\u201d him and lamented, \u201cWe don\u2019t know if you\u2019re hard-boiled or soft-boiled.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either,\u201d he confesses.Much has been made over the years about a perceived contrast between policing in New York and Southern California. Mr. Winslow says it\u2019s bunk. The stereotype was that some New York cops may be friendly, but often are on the take\u2014from shady lawyers, corrupt politicians or the mob. By contrast, some Southern California police officers were stereotyped as crew-cut clean\u2014and also violent and racist. New York was portrayed as the land of \u201cKojak\u201d and \u201cNYPD Blue\u201d while Los Angeles and its environs were imagined as \u201cDragnet\u201d and \u201cCHiPs.\u201dNew York and L.A. have different cultures as cities, but cops are basically cops, no matter where they are, Mr. Winslow says. Corruption scandals in the LAPD and police shootings in the NYPD have blended the images. Blurring the boundaries further are national issues such as video cameras and a shift in resources from fighting traditional crime to terrorism.Mr. Winslow says he is pro-cop, but his book doesn\u2019t spell out any conclusions about corruption. \u201cIt\u2019s a novel, not an op-ed piece,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Force\u201d is dedicated to 178 law-enforcement personnel murdered in the line of duty during the year and a half he spent sitting down to write the book. When talking to current and former police officers, the author says, he was struck by how emotional they became when talking about crime victims.\u201cThe difference between them and us,\u201d Mr. Winslow adds, \u201cis that they deal with the victims every goddamned day, and they have to go to the families and tell them, \u2018Your father is dead, your husband isn\u2019t coming home.\u2019 \u201dLos Angeles and its surroundings comprise a patchwork of jurisdictions, from the LAPD to county sheriffs to small municipalities, all jumbled together in a bountiful landscape for crime writers. New York City, with about 35,000 NYPD officers, is more confined\u2014and cop stories have to share the spotlight with the Mafia. A sampler:\u201cIt was a blonde. A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained-glass window.\u201dSince his debut the two-time Edgar Award winner has chronicled the coast from Los Angeles to the Mexican border.This former crime reporter for the L.A.

Hours later, he and the two others plowed it into people walking on London Bridge. After abandoning it on the side of the road, they slashed their way through a nearby area of bars and restaurants in an eight-minute rampage that killed eight people and wounded dozens. The assailants were shot and killed by police.Police also said that inside the van they discovered 13 wine bottles with rags wrapped around them and believed to be filled with a flammable liquid, as well as two blow torches.

Some companies eliminated bonuses altogether.That contrasts with the broader corporate sector, where incentive pay has steadily increased, growing 3% in 2016 from a year earlier.While most other industries have benefited from improving economic conditions since the recession, grocery retailers are facing intensifying competition from online merchants, discounters and new ways to buy food like subscription meal-kit services, even as deflation has eroded food prices.Same-store sales were flat across major food retailers last year after rising by at least 3% each of the three years prior, according to a FactSet industry average. Grocery stocks are down by an average of 5.4% so far this year.VIEW Interactive\u201cThe food-retailer space has been hit harder,\u201d said       John Roe,        head of ISS Analytics. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that in aggregate there was a sharp reduction in annual incentive payouts.\u201dOnly one of 10 major food retailers,             Casey\u2019s General Stores Inc.,        CASY 1.35%       raised its chief executive\u2019s bonus last fiscal year, compared with more than half of the 3,000 biggest public companies, the ISS analysis shows. CEOs of household- and personal-product firms saw the biggest jump in compensation last year, followed by executives at food, beverage and tobacco companies and those leading utility businesses, while retail heads fared the worst.Long an executive staple in other industries, performance-based bonuses are newer in the grocery sector, which more recently has tapped them to attract outside talent, according to management consultants.But if the industry remains stagnant, it could become harder to recruit the kind of younger, tech-savvy executives that grocery stores needs to compete with             Amazon.com                   and other e-commerce food-sellers, industry analysts and recruiters said.\u201cIt creates a lot of uncertainty,\u201d said       Jose L. Tamez,        managing partner for Austin-Michael, a Denver-based executive recruiting firm focused on food retail.The hit comes as base pay for food-retail executives has also fallen. Salaries for CEOs at large food retailers averaged $1.5 million last year, down 14% from $1.75 million in 2012, according to an analysis of 32 supermarkets by Austin-Michael.\u00a0Other C-suite salaries fell by single digits.Kroger        KR 1.73%       Chief Executive       Rodney McMullen       received incentive pay of $720,000 last fiscal year\u2014a quarter of the $3 million he made in 2015. The cut followed Kroger\u2019s largest miss on performance-based milestones since 2002.A company spokesman said Kroger, the nation\u2019s largest supermarket chain, remained confident it would deliver growth for investors and was committed to having executive bonuses rise \u201cwhen performance justifies doing so and decline when it does not.\u201dWhole Foods Market,             Inc., for the second year said it wasn\u2019t awarding bonuses to executives, as the natural-food grocer deals with flagging sales.

Though the warehouse-style grocer couldn\u2019t hit most of the easier metrics, Smart & Final gave out $518,840 in discretionary bonuses last fiscal year based on its success in expanding store count, a spokeswoman said.If the industry\u2019s troubles persist, executives and recruiters say companies will need to revise their performance targets or provide some other kinds of incentive.Still, providing compensation that\u2019s too large would be off-key, consultants said. \u201cBusiness is bad.

It was also just plain weird.The Cleveland Cavaliers won, too. They became the first team to beat the Golden State Warriors in nearly two months and saved their season with a 137-116 win on Friday night that spoiled Golden State\u2019s shot at a perfect 16-0 postseason record and sent the series back to Oakland for Game 5 on Monday night.But it\u2019s hard to know how much it mattered. It could have been the start of another monumental comeback. It also could have simply delayed the inevitable.The uncertainty is partly because the Cavs are still down 3-1 to a historically great team\u2014which happens to be how they won last year\u2019s Finals\u2014but in larger part because their Game 4 win required them to do some extraordinary things that had never been done before. It already seems like the series anomaly.Here\u2019s what had to happen for the Cavs to beat the Warriors: They had to have one of the greatest nights in the history of professional basketball.Kevin Love had to be perfect shooting corner 3-pointers. The shots from 30 feet that J.R. Smith always thinks are dropping actually had to drop. Kyrie Irving had to score 40 points, including two left-handed shots, not to mention all the shots he made with his dominant right hand.       LeBron James       had to be LeBron James. He had to have another triple double of 31 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. He also had to throw a pass off the backboard, finish the alley-oop himself and then make it sound as routine as brushing his teeth.\u201cJust threw it off the glass and went and got it,\u201d he said.The Cavs had to score more points in the first quarter (49) than any team in any Finals game ever. They had to score more points in the first half (86) than any team in any Finals game ever. They had to sink more threes (24) than any team in any Finals game ever, too. \u201cOne of those games,\u201d said Warriors star Stephen Curry. \u201cNot going to overreact.\u201dIt was a performance that only seemed more absurd within the context of basketball history. There are 14 teams in the sport\u2019s 3-point era that scored fewer points in Finals games than the Cavaliers scored in the first half\u2014and those were games they actually won. Their insane number of threes in this one game alone was twice the number the 1986 champion Boston Celtics made in their Finals series. That series lasted six games.Cleveland had nothing to lose, and they won because nearly everything went in.\u201cWe knew this team was beatable,\u201d Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said. \u201cWe knew we can play better, and this is the result you get when we play at our best.\u201dThe crazy thing is they could have been even better. The Cavs scored 86 points in the first half even while leaving nine points at the free-throw line. Not since a meaningless November game in 1990 has any NBA team scored more than 90 points in the first half. Cleveland was a few missed foul shots from a half the likes of which the league had never seen.But it was after halftime when things got truly bizarre. The Cavaliers were unconscious in the first half. The game lost its mind in the second half.It seemed like Warriors forward Draymond Green had been ejected when referees whistled him for what appeared to be his second technical foul. The officials huddled and remembered the other technical foul assessed to Green was really meant for Golden State coach Steve Kerr, not Green, who stayed on the court as Cleveland fans chanted his first name followed by a word that was not his last name.It was as chaotic as it sounds. It only got more confusing as the technicals kept coming and the game dragged for nearly three hours. James and Kevin Durant both got technicals for saying what appeared to be mean things to each other. Zaza Pachulia got one for punching the groinal region of Iman Shumpert. Shumpert got one, too, for some reason.Then a fan sitting courtside was ejected from the arena. Then the remaining fans shouted \u201cRuss-ell West-brook!\u201d at Durant. Then they remixed that same tune and changed the lyrics for a song with lyrics stolen from a deleted J.R. Smith tweet: \u201cCavs in Seven.\u201dSo that\u2019s what it took for the Cavs to beat the Warriors in Game 4. All they have to do now is beat them again in Game 5. And then again in Game 6. And then again in Game 7.Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-10 08:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-night-the-nba-finals-got-weird-1497099124", "news_title": "The Night the NBA Finals Got Weird", "keywords": "cavaliers,cleveland cavaliers,golden state warriors,kevin durant,kyrie irving,lebron james,nba finals,stephen curry,warriors,Cleveland Cavaliers,Golden State Warriors,basketball,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "An anonymous fan bid\u00a0$2,679,001\u00a0in a charity auction to have lunch with billionaire investor       Warren Buffett,        down\u00a0from last year\u2019s winning bid of $3,456,789.Now in its 18th\u00a0year, the annual auction for lunch with the             Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

The centenary of this moment will likely inspire a wave of celebratory concerts and recordings. Since Monk\u2019s death, in 1982, the influence of his compact body of compositions has grown with each passing decade; once considered radical, they are now as elemental to modern jazz as are       Bach\u2019s       to classical music. The characteristics of his piano playing\u2014jarring rhythmic displacements, clotted chords, flat-fingered runs and spiky dissonances\u2014still sound distinct even as they shape our ideas of contemporary music\u2019s possibilities.The first commemoration of Monk\u2019s centenary comes early, a posthumous gift from the master himself. \u201cThelonious Monk: Les Liaisons Dangereuses 1960\u201d (Sam Records/Saga), available as a deluxe double-CD or LP set, contains Monk\u2019s studio recordings for the soundtrack of       Roger Vadim\u2019s       French film of the same name. This music has never been available outside the context of the film. The master tapes of Monk\u2019s soundtrack were discovered in 2014, in the archives of       Marcel Romano,        the French promoter who introduced Vadim to Monk\u2019s music. Romano, who had brought       Miles Davis       to director Louis Malle to score \u201cAscenseur pour l\u2019\u00e9chafaud,\u201d also managed French tenor saxophonist Barney Wilen, who here joined Monk\u2019s quartet for several takes.Vadim\u2019s adaptation of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos\u2019s 18th-century novel embraced a story of bourgeois infidelity and seduction as transposed to 20th-century France, with a jazz soundtrack. (Cocktail-party scenes featured       Duke Jordan\u2019s       tunes played by       Art Blakey       and the Jazz Messengers, later released on the Fontana label.) Though commercially successful in France, the film is memorable now mostly for its nudity and risqu\u00e9 tone. Monk\u2019s music\u2014recorded in Manhattan, in the summer of 1959\u2014is, however, timeless musical expression that documents a significant moment.The list of classics recorded in 1959\u2014as transformative a year as jazz has known\u2014includes Miles Davis\u2019s \u201cKind of Blue,\u201d       John Coltrane\u2019s       \u201cGiant Steps\u201d and       Ornette Coleman\u2019s       \u201cThe Shape of Jazz to Come.\u201d It was also a heady time in Monk\u2019s career. Months earlier, he had played a landmark large-ensemble concert at Town Hall. His working quartet had just recorded a fine album with cornetist       Thad Jones       and, shortly before this soundtrack session, had played the Newport Jazz Festival to rave reviews. This quartet, excellent though short-lived, included bassist       Sam Jones,        drummer       Art Taylor       and tenor saxophonist       Charlie Rouse,        who had just begun a decade-long association with Monk.Yet as Monk\u2019s biographer       Robin D.G. Kelley       observes in an insightful liner note, Vadim had \u201capproached Monk at the absolute worst time.\u201d A dizzying professional schedule along with some setbacks, especially the loss of his cabaret card following an unjust arrest, had left Monk in the grip of severe emotional instability. He was, as Mr. Kelley writes, \u201covercommitted, tired, and ill.\u201d Thus, Monk wrote no new compositions or arrangements; these tracks seem more the stuff of a jazz-club performance or record date than a movie score.Still, Mr. Kelley writes, \u201cMonk chose the repertoire based on his understanding of the story, and played around with the tempos in order to capture the character\u2019s emotional state or circumstance.\u201d Indeed, the always-inventive Monk here emphasizes the emotional content of his music. A version of \u201cCrepuscule With Nellie,\u201d used for opening credits, contains noticeably pregnant pauses. Four versions of \u201cPannonica,\u201d two as solo piano, reveal subtly shifting shades of feeling. For a scene in which the innocent Marianne and her seducer, Valmont, meet in a church, Monk, perhaps as irony, played a straightforward version of the Rev.       Charles A. Tindley\u2019s       hymn \u201cBy and By (We\u2019ll Understand It Better By and By),\u201d which he likely learned as a teenager while playing for a traveling Pentecostal preacher.Nothing sounds revolutionary in these tracks, yet they reveal Monk during a dynamic year, in the midst of turmoil, seeming relaxed, playful and at the top of his game. His version of \u201cWell, You Needn\u2019t\u201d bristles with the particular energy afforded by this brief rhythm-section alliance with Jones and Taylor. \u201cRhythm-a-Ning\u201d is notable for Monk\u2019s differing interplay with each saxophonist. An improvised blues, originally untitled, listed here as \u201cSix in One,\u201d sounds like a sketch of what Monk recorded three months later as \u201cRound Lights.\u201d Here also is the only known studio recording of Monk\u2019s \u201cLight Blue\u201d (two versions, in fact). On the second, a 14-minute version credited as \u201cLight Blue (Making Of),\u201d Monk implores Taylor, against his protestations, to \u201ckeep on doing what you\u2019re doing\u201d\u2014to extend a three-beat pattern that forms a countermelody. Whether Monk was thinking about advancing Vadim\u2019s cinematic tale or simply telling his own story is anyone\u2019s guess.\u2014Mr. Blumenfeld writes about jazz for the Journal.

Fair experts say millennials are a choosier bunch: not easily amused and seeking a modern twist to old-timey fair traditions.\u201cI don\u2019t want any more sausage, period,\u201d said Larry Hays, concessions and vendors manager at the Big Butler Fair, held over the Fourth of July in Western Pennsylvania.In Rhode Island, the desire to attract a new generation has hot-wiener fans battling heartburn.The origins of the recent brouhaha can be traced in part to an article in Esquire magazine that highlighted a unique attribute of craft brewing in Rhode Island, the nation\u2019s littlest state. The headline asked, \u201cIs it possible to drink at every single brewery in one state in just one day?\u201d (It was).Detecting tourism potential, the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation thought it would be smart to capitalize on millennials\u2019 taste for craft beer, spokesman Mr. Sheaff said.The problem arose because the hot-wiener vendor occupied the one spot in the Rhode Island section large enough and with enough water access to accommodate the craft breweries, Mr. Sheaff said. The suds won.\u201cI was shocked,\u201d said Peter Xiarhos, co-owner of the snubbed vendor, Sam\u2019s New York System of Warwick, R.I., who has enlisted local politicians to appeal the decision. (Due to a quirky history dating back nearly a century, Rhode Island\u2019s hot wieners are dubbed \u201cNew York System.\u201d)Fans flooding social media wonder how craft beer can be more Rhode Island than hot wieners.\u201cAre they kidding? Beer brewers are all over,\u201d Warwick, R.I. retiree Joanne DiCenzo, who is 70 years old, wrote in a             Facebook                   post on Sam\u2019s page. \u201cWake up RI Commerce.\u201dOn Tuesday, at the Warwick dog stand, 50-year-old John Perrotta picked up two wieners \u201call the way\u201d\u2014with sauce, onions, mustard and celery salt. Mr. Perrotta said craft beer might be popular, but that it isn\u2019t a reason to visit Rhode Island.\u201cNew York system, coffee milk, clam cakes, things of that nature,\u201d he said. \u201cCraft beer wouldn\u2019t be the first thing on my list.\u201dDennis Larson, who selects vendors at the Minnesota State Fair, which starts in late August, accepted a few new vendors this year out of some 375 applicants, including a speakeasy-style eatery serving brie panini.\u2018The millennials are not going to keep coming for corn dogs and funnel cakes.\u2019\u201cThe millennials are not going to keep coming for corn dogs and funnel cakes,\u201d Mr. Larson said.With a large segment of Minnesota State Fair attendees still 40ish and up with families, he isn\u2019t nixing crowd-pleasers such as deep-fried cheese curds or pork chops on a stick. Butter sculptures, the lumberjack show and the 4-H livestock are still on.Still, the fair\u2019s visitor guide now suggests the best selfie spots. Those tend to be places with iconic fair views, but vendors are trying to get in on it, too. Al\u2019s Malts & Subs has placed a tall lime-green rubber cutout of a man outside the shop to attract young customers.\u201cThe millenials just love it,\u201d said Mark Hohenwald, who owns the stand. \u201cAll day long and even into the night they\u2019re taking pictures with it.\u201dTo catch the Instagram crowd, Minnesnowii Shave Ice vendor Jason Giandalia stocks multihued cups and six shades of neon spoons to mix and match for maximum likability.\"I\u2019ll do a yellow cup if they\u2019re doing the blue raspberry. I\u2019ll pick like a green spoon and a purple straw. Because I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re going to take a picture,\u201d he said.Eliza Adams, 21, who attends Colby College and is doing a summer internship in Boston, said a fair isn\u2019t on her list of upcoming plans.\u201cMaybe if it popped up on Facebook or social media I would go, but it\u2019s not really on my radar,\u201d she said.Write to Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-10 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/its-not-you-its-millennials-rhode-island-dumps-hot-wieners-for-craft-beer-1497096001", "news_title": "It\u2019s Not You, It\u2019s Millennials: Rhode Island Dumps Hot Wieners for Craft Beer ", "keywords": " big e fair, fair food, hot wieners, millennial marketing,rhode island, state fair,political,general news,generational cohorts,society,community,food,drink,living,lifestyle,wine,beer,spirits"}, {"content": "Newly public companies, eager to take advantage of rising U.S. stock prices, are returning to the market faster than ever to sell additional shares.It is the latest sign that public markets have regained appeal for companies and their owners after the slowest year for initial public offerings in more than a decade. Major U.S. stock indexes are hitting records, volatility has been low and shares of companies that have launched IPOs recently have generally performed well\u2014fertile conditions for selling more stock.The average number of days between a company\u2019s IPO and its next stock sale, also called a follow-on offering, is on pace for a record low this year, according to Dealogic data through Thursday that goes back to 1995. U.S.-listed companies launching their first stock sales in 2017 are doing so roughly 500 days after their IPOs, the data show, compared with an average of more than 900 days since the start of the data.That pace tends to fluctuate with the performance of the broader stock market: The average number of days between IPO and follow-on ballooned during the dot-com bust of the early 2000s, and widened again during the financial crisis.The compressed schedule also is a symptom of the shrinking stock market. Private fundraising opportunities and mergers and acquisitions have translated into fewer investment opportunities for public investors in recent years. That has created pent-up demand for new stock from young companies and is helping to accelerate follow-ons, some bankers, portfolio managers and analysts say.The number of U.S.-listed companies has declined by more than 3,000 in the past two decades, according to the University of Chicago\u2019s Center for Research in Security Prices, and last year was the slowest in terms of money raised by U.S.-listed IPOs since 2003, according to Dealogic.\u201cWe had a period of time when the IPO window was frozen and we didn\u2019t see a lot, so investors were clamoring for new investment opportunities,\u201d said Aram Green, portfolio manager at ClearBridge Investments, referring to recent follow-on deals.Jeld-Wen Holding Inc.,       a maker of doors and windows, announced its first follow-on offering in mid-May, 109 days after its late-January IPO. Earlier this year, oil-field-services company             Smart Sand Inc.       sold additional shares 90 days after its November IPO, the quickest return to the stock market for a newly public company since 2014, according to Dealogic.Newly public companies controlled by private-equity firms are among some of the quickest returnees to the stock market. So-called financial-sponsor-backed IPOs often have lockup periods of 180 days after their IPOs before their owners can sell more stock. During that period, existing shareholders are required to hold the stock.If the circumstances are right\u2014say, if the stock is performing well and if public investors want more stock\u2014underwriters can waive the lockup period for these companies and they can come back to the stock market to sell more shares sooner. If the stock market is soaring and the company\u2019s shares are near highs, it makes sense to try to waive the lockup and sell out of the company more rapidly, bankers say. It typically takes at least two to three years for a private-equity firm to completely sell out of a company it brings public, according to bankers who work on such deals.This year\u2019s batch of IPOs trade at an average of 14% above their offering price through Thursday\u2019s close, according to Dealogic. Companies that went public last year have gained an average 35% from their IPO prices. The S&P 500 has risen 8.6% so far this year.\u201cGiven that stocks are trading at such high valuation levels and some of these financial sponsors have held on to these companies for a longer period of time before they recently went public, it makes sense to see faster follow-on offerings,\u201d said Frank Maturo, vice chairman of equity capital markets for the Americas at UBS Group AG.In another sign of demand for new shares, private-equity firms also are taking smaller discounts when they sell. Typically when follow-on offerings are announced, a company\u2019s stock sells off in anticipation of a flood of new shares to the marketplace. From the time a private-equity-backed company\u2019s follow-on offering is announced to the time it is priced, its stock has fallen 4.2% on average in 2017 through Thursday, less than the 5% average drop in data going back to 2000, Dealogic data shows.Jeld-Wen\u2019s stock sold in its follow-on offering at a 4.3% discount to its price before the deal was announced, while Smart Sand\u2019s stock fell 3.6% between the time the offering was announced and when it priced, according to Dealogic. Jeld-Wen didn\u2019t respond to a request for commentFor its follow-on offering, Smart Sand said underwriters waived its lockup period in order for shareholders, including private-equity owner Clearlake Capital Group, to sell more stock. The company had sold shares at $11 apiece in its IPO. Clearlake didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\u201cIn February, the stock was above $17 a share, and that was really the driver going sooner than we typically would,\u201d said       Lee Beckelman,        chief financial officer at Smart Sand. \u201cYou have to be opportunistic.\u201dSince then the stock has struggled; it ended Friday at $8.90.Write to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Post-IPO Offers Speed Up.'", "news_time": "2017-06-10 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/post-ipo-companies-are-returning-to-stock-market-faster-than-ever-1497092400", "news_title": "Post-IPO, Companies Are Returning to Stock Market Faster Than Ever ", "keywords": "follow-on offering,ipo,pe industry news,shares,stock market,stock sale,Aram Green,Frank Maturo,corporate changes,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,new products,services,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Senate Republicans plan to strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood Federation of America and add several other abortion restrictions to their health-insurance overhaul bill, creating another potential concern for centrist GOP senators who are considering whether to back the legislation.Republican leaders believe they have the votes to keep the defunding measure in any final Senate bill, people familiar with the discussions said, though they still could remove it should that be the deciding factor in the bill\u2019s passage.Defunding Planned Parenthood has long been a priority for conservative lawmakers and anti-abortion groups, and they see the health bill as a rare opportunity to do so. Republicans plan to use a procedural maneuver to pass the bill with a simple Senate majority rather than the 60 votes usually required, giving the anti-abortion groups a potential opening.By law, Planned Parenthood can\u2019t use federal dollars to pay for abortions. But anti-abortion activists say any federal backing helps the nonprofit group stay in operation and continue performing the procedures, while abortion-rights groups say the money is used for unrelated exams and screening that are crucial to women\u2019s health.Anti-abortion groups such as the National Right to Life Committee, which maintains an influential scorecard for members of Congress based on their abortion and related votes, say inclusion of the defunding measure is a condition for their support of the broader health bill.\u201cWe have the votes in the Senate to pass this language now,\u201d said       Carol Tobias,        president of the group.These groups have also been pushing lawmakers to insert provisions in their bill that would bar people from using tax credits and money put into health-savings accounts to pay for abortions and some contraceptive coverage. The Senate parliamentarian has warned those lawmakers that attaching abortion restrictions to either measure could make them ineligible for inclusion in the bill, under Senate budget rules, forcing lawmakers to either excise the abortion language or remove the tax credits and health-savings accounts from their bill altogether.The push, coming from groups such as National Right to Life and the Susan B. Anthony List, has angered some centrist GOP senators, who are looking to broaden the tax credits and health-savings accounts to benefit low-income people. But the groups say that without the language included, they would be forced to oppose the entire bill.Coupling the Planned Parenthood measure in particular with the GOP\u2019s Affordable Care Act repeal legislation threatens to drive away at least two centrist Republican senators,       Susan Collins       of Maine and       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska.\u201cI don\u2019t think that low-income women should be denied their choice of health care providers for family planning, cancer screenings, for well-women care,\u201d Ms. Collins said last month on ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s not the only issue in this huge bill, but I certainly think it\u2019s not fair and it is a mistake to defund Planned Parenthood.\u201dIf the provision is included, Ms. Collins plans to introduce an amendment excising it from the bill, a move that Ms. Murkowski is expected to support. Their votes to remove the funding cutoff would likely leave the Senate at a 50-50 stalemate, assuming no Democrats vote for the defunding measure, forcing Vice President       Mike Pence       to cast a tie-breaking vote.A wild card could come in the form of Nevada Sen.       Dean Heller,        Republican who is considered one of the chamber\u2019s most vulnerable lawmakers in the 2018 midterm elections. At an April town-hall meeting, Mr. Heller told constituents who asked about the network of women\u2019s health clinics, \u201cI have no problems with federal funding for Planned Parenthood\u201d\u2014a statement his office later walked back.People close to the senator say he feels squeezed on the issue and believes it could have political consequences for his campaign. Should Mr. Heller signal to GOP leaders that he is hesitant to vote against Planned Parenthood, that would likely kill the defunding provision.\u201cWhile he doesn\u2019t have a problem with many of the health care services Planned Parenthood offers to women, he is opposed to providing federal funding to any organization that performs abortions and is supported by taxpayers\u2019 dollars,\u201d said       Megan Taylor,        a spokeswoman for Mr. Heller. \"He has a long record that reflects his position.\u201dSenate leaders for now are looking to use the House\u2019s defunding language, which would bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding for one year. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, such a measure would cut off the organization from about $178 million in federal funds.About 60% of Planned Parenthood\u2019s patients receive services through Medicaid and other federal programs.Congressional leaders can\u2019t include a permanent ban on Planned Parenthood under the Senate\u2019s special budgetary rules, because the CBO has estimated such a ban would cost the federal government extra money in increased births.Democrats attacked the GOP plans, as did Planned Parenthood\u2019s leaders.\u201cInstead of plotting the repeal of the Affordable Care Act in secret, Senate Republican leaders should listen to the 80% of voters who support Planned Parenthood and reject efforts to block people from getting care at our health centers,\u201d said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund.Even as the Senate debate continues, several states have moved to cut off Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, which could have more lasting impact.Earlier this month, Texas asked the federal government to restore Medicaid funding to family-planning programs the state had shunned for years\u2014with the proviso that the state be allowed to exclude Planned Parenthood as a provider. If the       Trump       administration grants that request, it would likely spur other Republican-dominated states to seek similar waivers.Several other states including Iowa are considering setting up state-funded family-planning programs that exclude abortion providers, forgoing federal funds in exchange for the ability to deny clinics like Planned Parenthood tax dollars. A recent move in this direction by Iowa\u2019s governor prompted Planned Parenthood to announce it would close four clinics in the state.Write to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-10 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-gop-plans-to-strip-planned-parenthood-funding-in-health-bill-1497092407", "news_title": "Senate GOP Plans to Strip Planned Parenthood Funding in Health Bill ", "keywords": "abortion,affordable care act,health insurance,health law,obamacare,planned parenthood,republicans,senate,Planned Parenthood Federation of America,political,general news,society,community,ethical issues,demographic health,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,medical treatments,procedures,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,women's health"}, {"content": "Braxten Nielsen       takes the advice to get back on his horse literally.In the relatively short time since Mr. Nielsen first tried rodeo, that attitude has served him well. After just over two years in the sport, he\u2019s representing Weber State University in the College National Finals Rodeo in Casper, Wyo., starting Sunday.And unlike most college athletes, there\u2019s a chance Mr. Nielsen, ranked fifth nationally among collegians in his event, bareback riding, could win some prize money. The National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association, which governs college rodeo, isn\u2019t part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, so student-athletes aren\u2019t required to compete as amateurs. Last year, some of the highest-earning competitors at the finals brought home around $4,000 in prize money.The 24-year-old Mr. Nielsen took a winding route to his college rodeo career. He\u2019d once hoped to earn a college football or basketball scholarship. But when the offer to play basketball at a junior college came with a requirement to sit out his first season, Mr. Nielsen balked. \u201cI was a little punk,\u201d he says.Instead, he traveled to Morristown, N.J., serving a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which included helping to rebuild following Hurricane Sandy. After the mission, Mr. Nielsen returned to his home state of Utah, putting off college to make some money working in oil fields. There, he made became friends with       Shad Feild.       Shad\u2019s brother, Kaycee, is a four-time world-champion bareback rider.Shad regularly ribbed Mr. Nielsen about how his small stature\u2014he\u2019s 5-foot-8\u2014would make it difficult for him to earn a living as a basketball or football player. \u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019d be a fantastic bareback rider and I know somebody who can help you,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Nielsen recalls.And so Mr. Nielsen began working with       Kaycee Feild,        ultimately quitting his job so he could train more intensely with the rodeo star. \u201cI had never seen someone so natural so fast. It was unbelievable,\u201d Mr. Feild says. Before getting on a horse in competition for the first time, Mr. Nielsen rode Mr. Feild\u2019s spur board\u2014a wood contraption that mimics the motions of a bucking horse\u2014and practice horses that are \u201cless bucky,\u201d as Mr. Nielsen puts it.\u201cThat first time getting on and actually riding a bucking horse was more of a mental game than it was anything else,\u201d Mr. Nielsen says. But it requires plenty of physical strength, too.Bareback rodeo riders must stay on their horses for at least eight seconds while holding on with only one hand. They are also judged on their technique. Maintaining control while the horse is bucking requires effort from almost all parts of the body.Mr. Nielsen typically begins his day at about 6 a.m. He gets in a cardio workout, usually a run or bike ride through the mountain ranges near his home in Logan, Utah, for up to two hours. Then he comes home and rides his spur board for about 20 minutes to lock in his muscle memory for competition. The spur board is part of a larger gym Mr. Nielsen set up in his garage. Mr. Nielsen got most of the weight equipment secondhand from a local high school.Mr. Nielsen eats breakfast and then heads to Ogden, Utah, for a couple of hours of classes at Weber State, where he studies business communication. A rodeo scholarship brought Mr. Nielsen, who began his career on the professional circuit, to the school.After class, he heads back to his garage gym for about two hours. After dinner, Mr. Nielsen goes for a 20- or 30-minute swim about two to three times a week.Mr. Nielsen also practices with his college team once a week. During these sessions he hops on two to three practice horses and then reviews the footage with his coaches. \u201cThen I go home and dream about it,\u201d he says.Mr. Nielsen sticks mostly to lean proteins and vegetables. Every morning after his cardio workout, he usually has a spinach omelet with a protein shake and potatoes. For lunch he often packs chicken and avocado to eat between classes. Dinner is a salad paired with chicken, fish, beef and even elk meat.Mr. Nielsen estimates he spent about $4,000 to buy all of the gear he uses to compete. That includes chaps, wrangler pants, boots, boot straps, a protective vest, cowboy hat and a rigging, the handle bareback riders use while they\u2019re on the horse.Mr. Nielsen says he listens to motivational speakers, including       James Tarantin       and       Eric Thomas,        while he works out. That\u2019s part of Mr. Nielsen\u2019s broader strategy that combines meditation, visualization and other tools to ensure he has the mental toughness to stay on the horse every time he gets into the ring.\u201cWhen I\u2019m not at a rodeo, I really picture myself being at the rodeo ground,\u201d he says, adding that he likes to imagine \u201chow I\u2019m going to look on the horse and then visualize winning. When I win it\u2019s not a surprise, I\u2019ve already been there and done that.\u201dWrite to Jillian Berman at workout@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-10 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-college-cowboy-preps-for-his-biggest-rodeo-1497092401", "news_title": "How a College Cowboy Preps for His Biggest Rodeo", "keywords": "bareback,bronc,college national finals rodeo,college rodeo,eight seconds,horse,more on fitness,rodeo,scholarship,spur board,training,Braxten Nielsen,political,general news,education,physical fitness,health,living,lifestyle,sports,recreation,university,college,routine general news"}, {"content": "ISTANBUL\u2014French photographer       Mathias Depardon       has been released after a month in detention in Turkey.Mr. Depardon arrived in Paris Friday night, according to press freedom organization Reporters Without Borders, or RSF by its French initials. He boarded a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul.He was deported after a lengthy diplomatic and legal effort that involved the presidents of Turkey and France to get him released from police custody for allegedly violating Turkish media law.Earlier Friday, French President       Emmanuel Macron       announced\u00a0that Mr. Depardon was released. \u201cI am very happy to announce the return to France tonight\u00a0of our countryman, the photojournalist @mathiasdepardon,\u201d Mr. Macron posted on             Twitter.\u201cThis is the case of many journalists working and living in this country,\u201d Mr. Depardon, who has contributed to The Wall Street Journal among other publications, told Turkish television while in transit through Ataturk airport in Istanbul. \u201cI\u2019m sending a lot of support to all the journalists who happen to be not able to keep on working, and I wish you all to keep on working and to keep on reporting and to keep on witnessing.\u201dMr. Depardon was detained May 8\u00a0while on assignment for National Geographic in Batman province, in southeast Turkey. Mr. Depardon, a resident of Turkey for five years, had applied for renewal of his press accreditation, but authorities had yet to grant it when he started his assignment, his lawyer said.On May 11, a judge issued an administrative order to deport Mr. Depardon due to his lack of valid credentials, and his lawyer said she worked to arrange the logistics of his departure. However, the case suddenly lost momentum and Mr. Depardon remained in a deportation center for weeks without explanation from the authorities.On May 25, Mr. Macron raised the case with Turkish President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       on the sidelines of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels.After this diplomatic outreach, Mr. Depardon received his first visit from French consular officials.The reason for Mr. Depardon\u2019s deportation\u00a0on Friday wasn\u2019t immediately clear.Mr. Depardon\u2019s Turkish lawyer said she had not been in touch with him on Friday and had not received official notice of his deportation. Turkey\u2019s Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u201cWhat is obvious at this point is that Mathias\u2019 case was politicized,\u201d said       Johann Bihr,        who heads the Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk at RSF. \u201cOtherwise there is no way to understand why Mathias stayed so long in detention after a deportation order was issued and the presidents of the two countries had discussed it.\u201dMore than 160 journalists are currently in detention in Turkey, according to Turkish reporters rights group P-24. The vast majority of those are Turkish nationals. Under a state of emergency imposed following a failed military coup attempt last July, the government has shuttered dozens of media outlets.A number of foreign journalists have been detained in Turkey in recent years.

Yes. Do we trust them? No, we don\u2019t,\u201d said       Charlie Diebel,        head of rates at Aviva Investors.The difficulties that polls had in two earlier surprises, Britain voting to leave the European Union last June and       Donald Trump\u2019s       victory in the U.S. presidential election, left investors fearing that surveys were systematically underestimating a wave of antiestablishment sentiment around the globe.In the final days before the British vote this week, opinion polls published by a dozen or so firms showed a wide variation in the size of the Conservative lead, from as little as 1 percentage point over the main opposition Labour Party to a 12-point gap. Still, Mrs. May had a lead of 8 points, according to a Wall Street Journal average of opinion polls, which many expected would be enough for her to deliver a comfortable win.But some investors, scarred by recent polling misfires, were already skeptical.Earlier this week, investors at             Aberdeen Asset Management                   sat down in their central London office to discuss how to position their portfolio ahead of the U.K. election. They decided that, given their record over the past year, polls can\u2019t really be trusted this time around.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the methodology, maybe it\u2019s shy voters, but there must be something they are missing,\u201d said       Roger Webb,        Aberdeen\u2019s head of European credit. \u201cIn any case, for us it means we can\u2019t really position ourselves based on polls.\u201dMr. Diebel said investors used to have greater faith in the accuracy of polls, but that was shaken last year with the surprise votes for Brexit and Mr. Trump.\u201cWithin the City, a lot of people spend a lot of time slicing and dicing [voting data] in inordinate detail and supposedly can read the tea leaves better than others. But most of those [people] got it bang wrong,\u201d said Mr. Diebel, a self-proclaimed polling skeptic.Part of the challenge may be a tendency to discount poll results that run up against expectations or against the herd.A model predicting the Conservatives would lose seats sparked controversy when it was released in late May. The pound initially fell against the dollar after the results of the model from pollster YouGov were published on the front page of the Times of London. The model attracted criticism from many quarters, with one political commentator labeling it \u201cbunkum and balderdash.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand how the data could be wrong, but everybody was telling us we were crazy,\u201d said       Stephan Shakespeare,        chief executive at YouGov.The pollster conducted 300,000 interviews of 121,000 people, producing a mass of data, including respondents\u2019 previous voting choices and their favorite television programs. That was then overlaid onto a map of the U.K.\u2019s voting constituencies. The last prediction before voting day pointed to neither party winning enough seats to form a government.But YouGov was an outlier: most other polls were united in expecting Conservative gains.It is not the first time in a U.K. election that the polls got it wrong. Ahead of the 1992 general election, most opinion polls had Labour consistently ahead, but the Conservatives actually won. Faulty predictions ahead of the election in 2015 prodded the polling industry in the U.K. to\u00a0overhaul the arcane methods it employs\u00a0to divine public opinion.This week\u2019s vote \u201cwas an experimental election in some ways,\u201d said University of Southampton professor       Patrick Sturgis,        who chaired the inquiry into the 2015 poll. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say what exactly went wrong but in any case, it again hurts the credibility of the polling industry. And we might have another election very soon.\u201dSome commentators say pollsters have been unfairly derided.In the U.S. election, despite some glaring errors at the state level, pollsters\u2019 predictions that       Hillary Clinton       would win the popular vote proved true. Mr. Trump\u2019s share of the vote was underestimated but it was the electoral college that won him the presidency.And polls have scored a series of wins since. They correctly predicted the outcomes of races in the Netherlands and France earlier this year.But for many investors, that\u2019s too little, too late.Aberdeen\u2019s Mr. Webb said he\u2019s now looking at how the market is positioning instead of relying on polls.\u201cIt\u2019s not that the market is always right but polls seem to be wrong more often,\u201d he said.Write to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com and Christopher Whittall at christopher.whittall@wsj.comAppeared in the June 10, 2017, print edition as 'Investors Grow Skeptical of Polls.'", "news_time": "2017-06-10 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-another-surprise-election-result-investors-grow-skeptical-of-pollsters-1497087000", "news_title": "After Another Surprise Election Result, Investors Grow Skeptical of Pollsters ", "keywords": " election polling,pollsters,Stephan Shakespeare,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,insurance,market research,public relations,opinion polling,advertising,marketing,business,consumer services,financial services"}, {"content": "Iran has arrested dozens of suspected members of Islamic State as authorities sought to root out the extremist group following this week\u2019s deadly attacks in the heart of the Iranian capital.On Saturday, authorities detained seven people suspected of providing support to the attackers in the northern Alborz province, according to a state television website.These arrests come after the Intelligence Ministry on Friday said 41 suspects were taken into custody, but it didn\u2019t indicate whether they were involved in Wednesday\u2019s coordinated assault that left 17 people dead, the first attack by Islamic State on Iranian soil. All five assailants also were killed.The ministry said it received the cooperation from families of some of the suspected militants who were arrested Friday. It said it also seized a large number of weapons, bomb-making materials, explosive belts and communication devices, and had identified several safe houses in northwestern Iran.Wednesday\u2019s separate attacks by gunmen and suicide bombers hit two heavily guarded sites in Tehran\u2014Parliament and the shrine to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Iranian revolution and the founder of the Islamic Republic.Islamic State claimed responsibility for the assaults, and Iranian officials said the next day they believed the group was behind the operation.A fundamentalist Sunni Muslim group, Islamic State views Shiite Muslims as apostates, and on Friday, it again praised the five assailants for their attacks on mainly Shiite Iran. Through its Amaq news agency, it also warned that Wednesday\u2019s attacks would be \u201cthe beginning of even greater operations that will make Iran\u201d a new battlefield.The success of this week\u2019s assault in penetrating such heavily guarded sites sent shock waves through the Iranian capital, where the government\u2019s security and intelligence apparatus is pervasive.The breach is expected increase pressure on President       Hassan Rouhani       to close security gaps, say analysts who study Iran.The attack also poses a political challenge: The government has justified its military operations on behalf of Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad,        and against Islamic State forces in both Syria and Iraq, as necessary to prevent the extremist group from threatening Iran inside the country\u2019s borders.Iranians were defiant on Friday, as thousands of people flocked to central Tehran to attend funerals for the victims and hold a rally afterward.Throngs of mourners showered flower petals on a truck carrying the coffins of some of the victims as it moved down the street. A television broadcast showed a man carrying a sign reading: \u201cMay they rest in peace, rise proud, and empower the solidarity of my society.\u201dSome chants targeted Saudi Arabia. Many Iranians see the kingdom and its fundamentalist Wahhabi brand of Sunni Islam as the main source of regional terrorism.Iran\u2019s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said Wednesday that ultimate responsibility for Wednesday\u2019s bloodshed fell on Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s main regional rival for power and influence.

However, that proposal fell apart in December in the face of opposition from other major shareholders, whose holdings would have been diluted.By the end of 2016, Baoneng had a 25% stake in the real-estate company, while Evergrande over several months spent a total of 36.27 billion yuan building up its holding in Vanke, which was contending with boardroom turmoil as the takeover battle escalated.The aggressive investment activities of Evergrande and Baoneng have recently come under the scrutiny of Chinese regulators, part of a broader government effort to curb speculative investments and a heavy buildup in corporate borrowing there.Evergrande, which last year leapfrogged Vanke to become China\u2019s largest home builder by revenue, said in a Hong Kong stock-exchange filing it would record a loss of some seven billion yuan in the latest deal. Evergrande said proceeds from the stake sale will mainly go toward debt reduction. The company\u2019s leverage has surged in recent years, ending 2016 at $78 billion.The seeds of the latest agreement were sown in March, when Shenzhen Metro and Evergrande reached a proxy deal under which the developer turned over its voting power in Vanke to the subway operator, which in January agreed to buy a 15% stake in Vanke from China Resources Group for 37.2 billion yuan.The deal also comes after Evergrande\u2019s shares have more than doubled in the past month, hitting record highs, despite continuing concerns in some quarters about the company\u2019s balance sheet. By contrast, Vanke has seen its stock price stuck in a sideways trading range since peaking in November.The stake deal could help resuscitate the asset-swap effort. Under the original terms, Vanke would have given Shenzhen Metro equity in exchange for real-estate assets. Such an arrangement could allow Vanke to build real-estate projects on top of subway stations in Shenzhen, a technology and business hub just north of Hong Kong.\u2014Dominique Fong contributed to this articleWrite to Kevin Kingsbury at kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-10 01:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/battle-over-china-developer-vanke-might-be-in-final-throes-1497073469", "news_title": "Battle Over China Developer Vanke Might Be in Final Throes ", "keywords": " baoneng, chinese real estate, deal, developers, evergrande, sale takeover battle, shenzhen metro, stake,vanke,Baoneng Group,China Evergrande Group,3333.HK,HK:3333,China Vanke ,000002.SZ,Shenzhen Metro Group,China Resources Group,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,building construction,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,construction,real estate"}]
