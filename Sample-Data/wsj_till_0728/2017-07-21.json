GE 0.59%       chief executive, a post he assumes Aug. 1, has stoked some optimism about the company but not enough to buoy the stock. Shares of the giant industrial company are down 15% this year, through Tuesday\u2019s close, while the S&P 500 index is up 9.9%.The divergence is forcing GE to defend its conglomerate model to investors. The Boston company worked with activist Trian Fund Management earlier this year to set new cost-cutting targets. But Wall Street still is bracing for GE to lower its long-held 2018 profit target of $2 a share.\u201cInvestors have come to realize that $2 of earnings power in 2018 is simply not on the table,\u201d said Morgan Stanley analyst       Nigel Coe.       In May, current CEO       Jeff Immelt       said the goal was at the high end of expectations, warning that GE would need additional cost cuts to make it.On average, analysts expect earnings per share of $1.81 in 2018\u2014down from an average estimate of $1.89 calculated in late May\u2014and generally expect the company to lower the target either on Friday or in the months after Mr. Flannery, head of GE\u2019s health-care business, takes the reins.For the second quarter, Wall Street expects GE to report earnings of 25 cents a share, down about 50% from a year earlier, with revenue declining about 13%. The decline is largely attributable to a year-ago gain from GE selling its appliances business.Thomson Reuters says GE will be the biggest drag on S&P 500 profits, which are expected to rise 8.5% in the quarter from a year earlier. Excluding GE, S&P 500 profits are forecast to climb 9.5%.In the first quarter, GE reported a higher profit but Wall Street was blindsided by a negative cash flow of $1.6 billion from industrial operating activities. The company blamed the shortfall on the timing of inventory and orders. It reiterated its goal of $12 billion to $14 billion of positive industrial cash flow by year-end, up from $11.6 billion in 2016.Chief Financial Officer       Jeffrey Bornstein       said in April that cash from operating activities would be \u201csequentially much better in the second quarter than the first.\u201dGE has taken steps to retain cash by cutting the time its customers have to pay their bills, while extending the time it has to pay its own suppliers. In May, GE\u2019s Power division sent notices to some U.S. suppliers that it was lengthening the payment window and giving itself a discount if it pays those suppliers early.The worries about cash center around the company\u2019s dividend, which costs about $8 billion a year to fund. Deutsche Bank, one of the few brokerages with a \u201csell\u201d rating on the company, warned in May that GE might have trouble covering the dividend after capital spending and pension payments.In an interview last month, Mr. Flannery said the dividend is \u201csafe\u201d and reducing it won\u2019t be considered. He has promised to review the entire GE portfolio and produce recommendations by the fall.Citigroup analyst       Andrew Kaplowitz       is confident that cash generation will improve in the second quarter but is doubtful the negative sentiment around GE will improve until there is more clarity about Mr. Flannery\u2019s strategy.\u201cWe think investors could largely take a wait-and-see approach to GE until new management begins to communicate its key priorities,\u201d Mr. Kaplowitz said.Write to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.comAppeared in the July 20, 2017, print edition as 'Old Money Problems Await New GE Boss.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/old-worries-await-ges-new-chief-1500462000", "keywords": ["earnings outlook,earnings preview,earnings season,ge,ge earnings,immelt,s&p 500,stock news,Trian Fund Management,General Electric,GE,John Flannery,Andrew Kaplowitz,Nigel Coe,Jeffrey Bornstein,financial performance,earnings,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,machinery,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,diversified holding companies,alternative investments,business,consumer services,financial services,industrial goods,investing,securities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 21:49:00", "news_title": "Jared Kushner Discloses Dozens More Assets in Revised Financial Filing ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014      Jared Kushner,        President       Donald Trump\u2019s       son-in-law and a senior White House adviser, on Friday released a revised version of his personal financial disclosure showing his initial filing omitted dozens of assets, including commercial real estate, bonds issued by the New York water and sewer authority, a personal art collection and a New Jersey liquor license.According to the disclosure, 77 assets were \u201cinadvertently omitted\u201d from Mr. Kushner\u2019s earlier form and were added during what the form\u2019s footnotes describe as the \u201cordinary review\u201d process with the government ethics office. Some 60 of those were related to one collection of bonds. The updated form also provides additional information about 77 other assets, offering more detail about the structure of Mr. Kushner\u2019s real estate assets. Mr. Kushner\u2019s initial disclosure, released in March, hadn\u2019t then been certified by the Office of Government Ethics.Ivanka Trump,        who is the president\u2019s daughter, a senior White House aide and Mr. Kushner\u2019s wife, also disclosed her finances for the first time on Friday, including some details that had been previously disclosed on her husband\u2019s form. Ms. Trump didn\u2019t become an official White House employee until late March, so she had later deadlines. Unlike Mr. Kushner\u2019s, her form hasn\u2019t yet been certified by the ethics office, as required by law.\u201cJared and Ivanka have followed each of the required steps in their transition from private citizens to federal officials,\u201d       Jamie Gorelick,        a lawyer for the couple, said in a statement.The new disclosure shows Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump collectively hold between $206 million and $760 million in assets. Mr. Kushner\u2019s initial disclosure put the value of their assets between $240 million and $740 million. The changes in values may reflect divestments since the last filing and the broad range of valuation for assets.The concentration of wealth in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House and cabinet has meant that his appointees have faced a more complex and costly divestment and disclosure process than in previous administrations. Appointees are required to disclose their financial holdings and divest themselves of any assets that could present a potential conflict of interest with their new posts.Don Fox, who served as the ethics office\u2019s general counsel from 2008 to 2013 and as acting director from 2011 until 2013, said the number of omissions on Mr. Kushner\u2019s initial form was unusually high. \u201cThat strikes me as a lot,\u201d he said. But Mr. Fox, who was tapped to serve as general counsel by a Bush appointee, said it isn\u2019t \u201cterribly unusual\u201d for wealthy individuals, particularly those who lack previous government experience, to need to revise their forms.Ms. Gorelick said earlier this year that it was \u201cvery normal\u201d for a financial disclosure form to be revised and that Mr. Kushner\u2019s lawyers had prepared the form on his behalf. The Office of Government Ethics, which is charged with reviewing and certifying administration officials\u2019 financial disclosure forms, didn\u2019t respond to a question about whether it was customary to revise the form to the extent Mr. Kushner did.The disclosures show Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump will both continue to be passive investors in each of their family\u2019s real-estate businesses, receiving income from those holdings but not playing a role in decision-making. They will recuse themselves from government decisions that present conflicts of interest, a lawyer for Mr. Kushner said, though the White House isn\u2019t releasing the ethics agreements that detail that process.To enter the White House, Mr. Kushner resigned from 266 outside positions and Ms. Trump resigned from 292, their lawyer said, largely at subsidiaries of their families\u2019 multilayered real-estate businesses.In his initial disclosure, Mr. Kushner didn\u2019t identify business relationships with             Goldman Sachs Group                   and billionaires       George Soros       and       Peter Thiel       through a real-estate tech startup called Cadre that Mr. Kushner co-founded and currently partly owns, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year. An investment in Cadre valued at between $5 million and $25 million was included on the new disclosure, which showed Mr. Kushner resigned from his position with Cadre in January.The lawyer for Mr. Kushner declined to comment on the delay. The filing says the Cadre investment was previously included under another umbrella investment and not specifically disclosed. The filing also shows Mr. Kushner reduced his ownership share in Cadre.Also among the omitted assets is an art collection valued at between $5 million and $25 million. The attorney said he hadn\u2019t initially included the collection because it was for \u201cpersonal enjoyment,\u201d not held for investment purposes, but ultimately decided on disclosure.A Wall Street Journal analysis of securities and other filings earlier this year found Mr. Kushner also didn\u2019t disclose loans totaling at least $1 billion, from more than 20 lenders, to properties and companies he partly owned. He also has provided personal guarantees on more than $300 million of the debt, according to the analysis. A lawyer advising Mr. Kushner said Friday he isn\u2019t legally required to disclose those loans and they weren\u2019t included in the latest disclosure.Mr. Kushner has also filed revisions to a form required to obtain a security clearance that, in its initial form, didn\u2019t list contacts between him and foreign government officials. He subsequently submitted information about \u201cover 100 calls or meetings with representatives of more than 20 countries,\u201d Ms. Gorelick has said in a statement. Those contacts weren\u2019t made public.Ms. Trump received $2.5 million in \u201csalary and severance\u201d from her father\u2019s business operations, according to Friday\u2019s disclosure. She also received a $787,500 advance for her book, \u201cWomen Who Work.\u201dAccording to the form, she is at least a part owner of T International Realty LLC, TTT Consulting LLC and TTTT Venture LLC, assets she valued at between $11 million and $55 million in total. Those entities are affiliated with the Trump Organization through which Ms. Trump and her siblings receive consulting and management fees, the lawyer said.Instead of getting those fees, Ms. Trump now has an agreement with those entities to get guaranteed annual payments totaling $1.5 million, which means that the income is tied less directly to the success of the family business.Separately, Ms. Trump has her own clothing, accessories and lifestyle business, which she valued at more than $50 million. That business, which has been placed in a trust, generated more than $5 million from January 2016 through March 8, 2017 and another $1 million to $5 million since then. She is no longer involved in decision-making there.The disclosure also shows Ms. Trump earned $50,000 for her work overseeing a trust for some of the children of       Rupert Murdoch,        the executive chairman of both             21st Century Fox                   and             News Corp.       Ms. Trump resigned at the end of last year as a trustee. 21st Century Fox and News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.Ms. Trump held positions, typically vice president or executive vice president, with more than 200 entities that are part of her father\u2019s real-estate business.She has equity interests in relatively few of the entities. She owns part of the company\u2019s hotel in Washington, a stake valued at between $5 million and $25 million that generated $2.4 million in revenue from January 2016 to May 2017, including a period when the hotel wasn\u2019t yet open. She remains a passive investor in the Washington hotel and receives income from it.Walter Shaub, who resigned as Office of Government Ethics director earlier this month after clashing repeatedly with the White House and who has called for overhauling federal ethics rules, on Friday criticized the White House for installing the agency\u2019s general counsel, David Apol, as acting head of the agency.Protocol calls for the post to automatically go to the agency\u2019s chief of staff until the president officially appoints a new director. Mr. Shaub said Friday said the move suggested the White House \u201cmay be hoping to engineer looser oversight.\u201dThe ethics office and the White House didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on Mr. Shaub\u2019s complaint.\u2014Coulter Jones contributed to this article.Appeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Kushner Discloses Dozens More Assets.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jared-kushner-discloses-dozens-more-assets-in-revised-financial-filing-1500678017", "keywords": ["financial disclosure,Office of Government Ethics,Donald Trump,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,personal finance,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 21:15:00", "news_title": "Donald Trump\u2019s New Communications Director Comes From Wall Street", "content": "New York hedge-fund investor Anthony Scaramucci, President       Donald Trump\u2019s       newly appointed communications director, didn\u2019t jell with the president right away.But over time and after flirtations with other Republican candidates, Mr. Scaramucci, nicknamed \u201cThe Mooch,\u201d warmed to Mr. Trump, donating to his campaign and positioning himself for a White House job that didn\u2019t come right away.\u201cI love the president,\u201d said Mr. Scaramucci, 53 years old, at the White House on Friday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019ve been very, very loyal to him, and I\u2019m going to do the best I can with my heart and soul on this job and try to serve him the best way that I can.\u201dFor Mr. Scaramucci, a self-described diva, the move to the White House is the latest triumph in a career advanced through self-promotion and persistence.After he was fired in 1991 by             Goldman Sachs,       where he was a real-estate investment banker, he started and sold a money-management firm to Neuberger Berman Group Inc.Then, after an initial attempt at launching a fund-of-funds firm that essentially failed during the 2008 financial crisis, he purchased             Citigroup Inc.\u2019s       hedge-fund management group and renamed it SkyBridge Capital.He also launched the SALT conference (for SkyBridge Alternatives), a Las Vegas affair that attracted big-name hedge-fund players, celebrities such as Will Smith and world leaders, including former British Prime Minister       Tony Blair.The event became synonymous with Mr. Scaramucci, who started it in the depths of the recession.Mr. Scaramucci said he first met Mr. Trump about 20 years ago when he was in his 30s. Mr. Trump was a \u201cname brand even back in the day,\u201d he said.He said a close personal friend who he knew from Goldman Sachs introduced him to the future president. Messrs. Scaramucci and Trump crossed paths a few more times, he said, and they got closer during       Mitt Romney\u2019s       2012 presidential campaign.\u201cWe did a couple of fundraisers in his magnificent apartment,\u201d he said.His path to Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle was a winding one, including fundraising for two Trump rivals for the GOP nomination.Eventually, he signed on to raise money for Mr. Trump when many establishment Republicans still shunned him. He was later named to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team\u2019s executive committee, a group that included Mr. Trump\u2019s adult children.Despite his work on the campaign, Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s road to the White House was rocky. He had accepted one administration job in January and was blindsided by the news that the job had been given to someone else, according to a person familiar with the situation. He first learned he didn\u2019t get the job after the new appointment had been named.To take the administration job first promised to him, Mr. Scaramucci sold his stake in SkyBridge. The deal fetched about $250 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.SkyBridge, which says it helped clients invest $12 billion in total as of Nov. 30, recently reported that its main fund was down 1% last year, its second consecutive year of losses. Some of SkyBridge\u2019s competitors, such as funds run by             Carlyle Group,       have closed outright, while others have merged.While disappointed about losing the first job he was offered, Mr. Scaramucci continued to be an advocate for Mr. Trump on television and on Twitter. A person close to his thinking said he wanted to remain in front of the camera to showcase his communication skills to Mr. Trump. He had been discussing who he would like to suggest play him on Saturday Night Live to the show\u2019s creator, Lorne Michaels, the person said.Last month, Mr. Scaramucci was named as an ambassador to the Office of Economic Cooperation and Development, based in Paris. He was also recently named to a high-level position at the embattled Export Import Bank.On Friday at the White House, Mr. Scaramucci said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I would be standing here if I didn\u2019t have a good relationship with the president.\u201dWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Financier\u2019s Road To White House Job.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-new-communications-director-comes-from-wall-street-1500686101", "keywords": ["anthony scaramucci, communications director, donald trump, goldman sachs, salt conference, sean spicer, skybridge capital, the mooch, west wing, white house,Donald Trump"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 21:13:00", "news_title": "President Trump Shakes Up Communications Staff", "content": "President Donald Trump shook up his communications team on Friday following months of frustration, installing a top campaign fundraiser as its director and accepting the resignation of press secretary Sean Spicer, one of the White House\u2019s most recognizable faces.In a long-simmering staff shuffle, former New York hedge-fund investor       Anthony Scaramucci       will take over a 35-person team that has often struggled to push through a message amid fast-moving events and a steady stream of tweets from a president who relishes the reach of social media.Mr. Spicer\u2019s deputy,       Sarah Huckabee Sanders,        will succeed him in the job, putting her behind the lectern for daily press briefings that, on days they are televised, command audiences rivaling those of TV soap operas.The moves cap the rise and fall of Mr. Spicer and underscore the president\u2019s deep dissatisfaction with his communications team and his willingness to take action to fix it. The changes also point to divisions in the White House, where top officials clashed over Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s hiring.His appointment was backed by       Jared Kushner,        the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and opposed by Reince Priebus, the White House Chief of staff, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s hiring unsettles, at least in the short term, a West Wing chain of command that has been beset by constant competitions for power. Mr. Scaramucci said he would be reporting directly to Mr. Trump.Until now, the communications team was largely under the influence of Mr. Priebus, who had stocked it with Republican National Committee aides who worked for him when he was party chairman. By installing Mr. Scaramucci in the job, Mr. Trump is in essence diluting Mr. Priebus\u2019s power base.The new appointment also strengthens the position of Mr. Kushner, presumably giving him a new internal ally.Mr. Spicer, during his six-month stint as press secretary, became something of a mini-celebrity, satirized on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d by comedian Melissa McCarthy.Ms. McCarthy\u2019s portrayal was a hit with many viewers but not in the West Wing, where aides privately worried that Mr. Spicer was getting unwelcome attention distracting from the White House\u2019s agenda.Mr. Spicer\u2019s tenure drew criticism from the get-go when he claimed on the president\u2019s first full day in office that more people had witnessed the inauguration\u2014\u201cin person and around the globe\u201d than any in history. Pictures taken of the event showed that the crowd was smaller than that of former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       inauguration in 2009.Over time, Mr. Spicer\u2019s public role diminished. The White House began barring TV cameras from the briefings, and Ms. Sanders picked up more of his duties.Mr. Scaramucci, 53 years old, comes to the job without the years of government or campaign communications experience that his predecessors had.But a few parts of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 clearly appealed to Mr. Trump, an avid cable news viewer: He is a polished TV figure, having been a contributor to             Fox Business Network.       He also tangled successfully with CNN, a network that Mr. Trump and other White House officials view as an antagonist.Last month, CNN retracted a story it had written about Mr. Scaramucci. Three CNN staffers resigned, a development Mr. Trump highlighted on Twitter.In his debut in the White House press briefing room Friday, Mr. Scaramucci was pressed by reporters on whether he would reopen media briefings to TV cameras. He made no commitments.\u201cI obviously am committed to being transparent because I\u2019m standing here,\u201d he said.Mr. Scaramucci deflected questions about whether Mr. Trump would deliver on a promise to repeal former President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and usher in a new health-care system.Eventually, he said, \u201cthe president will get a win.\u201dHe also proclaimed his \u201clove\u201d for the president and dropped in bits of his biography. He mentioned his Harvard Law pedigree, his middle-class roots on Long Island and a book he had written.Mr. Scaramucci is joining a White House rife with factions and feuding.The president hasn\u2019t been happy with his communications operation, according to multiple White House officials. He has complained publicly and privately that the press team has been at times too slow or ineffective defending him.But some White House officials counter that the West Wing\u2019s problem is decision making, not public relations. Several allies approached by White House officials have turned down offers to join the team, said people familiar with the conversations.It is unclear whether Mr. Scaramucci can help shift the focus back to the policy agenda or win the loyalty of powerful colleagues wary of his arrival.Ryan Williams, who was an aide to former Republican presidential candidate       Mitt Romney,        said: \u201cThere really is not a way to turn around the communications operation when the president continues to blow up the best laid plans on a daily basis with tweets and off-message remarks.\u201dBut a friend of Mr. Scaramucci,       Sean Hannity,        host of \u201cHannity\u201d on Fox News Channel, said in an interview: \u201cAnthony is a great communicator and a fighter and aggressive and smart. He\u2019s got all the qualities that the White House communications director needs.\u201dInside the White House, assessments of Mr. Scaramucci are mixed.A couple of weeks ago, Mr. Kushner began planning to bring Mr. Scaramucci into the communications shop, a person familiar with the matter said.Mr. Spicer, a Priebus ally, privately warned that the New York hedge-fund investor lacked the required experience for the job, a White House official said. Mr. Spicer quit rather than work under Mr. Scaramucci, the person said.Should he stay in Mr. Trump\u2019s good graces, Mr. Scaramucci could rise further. Mr. Trump has often asked friends and political allies about his senior team and whether others, including Mr. Priebus, should be replaced.Nicknamed \u201cThe Mooch,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci didn\u2019t jell with Mr. Trump right away. Talking about his future boss early in the presidential race, Mr. Scaramucci was open in his disdain.In the summer of 2015, Mr. Scaramucci called Mr. Trump a \u201chack politician\u201d destined to be president of the \u201cQueens County Bully\u2019s Association.\u201dIn the White House briefing room Friday, he was asked about his past criticism of a president known to bristle over slights.\u201cHe brings it up every 15 seconds,\u201d he said, describing the comments as \u201cone of the biggest mistakes that I made.\u201d He was backing another candidate at the time, he said.And, apparently aware that his boss would be watching him as he had monitored Mr. Spicer, he said: \u201cI should never have said that about him\u2026I hope that someday, Mr. President, you\u2019ll forget it.\u201d\u2014Ted Mann and Lisa Beilfuss contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Michael C.

But guidance from the Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, on a draft of the bill indicates that these provisions will need 60 votes to remain in the health-care bill.With 52 of the Senate\u2019s 100 seats, Republicans likely won\u2019t be able to keep the antiabortion provisions that were key to retaining the support of conservatives for the health-care overhaul. No Democrats are expected to vote for the bill.Ms. MacDonough\u2019s recommendations were released by Senate Democrats.\u201cThe parliamentarian\u2019s decision today proves once again that the process Republicans have undertaken to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw 22 million Americans off of health insurance is a disaster,\u201d Sen.       Bernie Sanders       (I., Vt.), the most senior member of the Democratic caucus on the Budget Committee, said in a statement Friday.Joe Brenckle,        a spokesman for Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee, said, \u201cThe parliamentarian has provided guidance on an earlier draft of the bill, which will help inform action on the legislation going forward.\u201dGOP aides noted that in the past, lawmakers have been able to make tweaks that enabled provisions flagged by the parliamentarian to meet muster later.Still, the likely loss of the antiabortion measures could complicate the bill\u2019s passage in both the Senate, where its fate is already imperiled, and the House. Republicans had seen the health-care bill as their best opportunity to block federal funding for Planned Parenthood because they are taking advantage of a procedural shortcut tied to the budget known as reconciliation that enables them to pass legislation with just a simple majority. Most bills need 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles in the Senate.But to take advantage of the reconciliation process, legislation has to comply with the Byrd Rule, which tries to rein in senators from slipping in measures with little effect on the budget. It typically is up to the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian to recommend whether provisions have enough budgetary impact to qualify.If they don\u2019t, then the provisions can only remain in the legislation if 60 senators vote to keep them. In this case, most Democrats and even some Republicans have made clear they won\u2019t support defunding Planned Parenthood. GOP Sens.       Susan Collins       of Maine and       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska had planned to offer an amendment stripping the provision, which would bar Medicaid from making any payments to Planned Parenthood for one year.\u201cThe \u2018defund\u2019 Planned Parenthood provision is the epitome of a mean-spirited policy that hurts millions of women and has no place in legislation, period,\u201d Dana Singiser, Planned Parenthood\u2019s vice president of public policy and government affairs, said in a statement Friday.The parliamentarian\u2019s recommendations didn\u2019t come as a surprise to GOP lawmakers and aides. Republicans had expected that putting antiabortion limits around tax credits that people could use to buy health insurance could run into procedural problems. Republicans have discussed keeping the basic structure of the 2010 health law\u2019s subsidies in place but tweaking them.The ACA subsidies, which are advance tax credits paid to insurance companies to lower the cost of health-insurance premiums, currently can\u2019t be used by insurance companies to cover the cost of abortions.In another blow to Senate Republicans, a separate provision that would impose a waiting period on coverage of six months for people who let their insurance lapse would also face a 60-vote threshold, according to the parliamentary guidance, meaning it would likely get cut from the bill. The penalty was aimed at keeping premiums affordable by making sure consumers maintain coverage when they are healthy.Under the provision, individuals who had a break in continuous coverage for 63 days or more in a prior year would have to wait six months before coverage begins, according to the change, but they wouldn\u2019t have to pay premiums during that time.The parliamentary rules are also likely to block a measure included in the House bill at the request of some New York Republicans intended to stop New York state from raising Medicaid funding through county taxes.Senate Democrats said new hurdles facing that provision, known as the \u201cBuffalo buyout,\u201d could imperil the ability of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) to make other state-specific deals to help grease the bill\u2019s passage.\u201cThis will greatly tie the majority leader\u2019s hands as he tries to win over reluctant Republicans with state-specific provisions,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said in a statement Friday. \u201cWe will challenge every one of them.\u201dWrite to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/parliamentary-rules-likely-to-prevent-senate-gop-from-defunding-planned-parenthood-1500684653", "keywords": [" abortion, aca, affordable care act, anti-abortion, obamacare,planned parenthood, pro-abortion, pro-life, republican health care,Planned Parenthood Federation of America,regulation,government policy,government aid,corporate,industrial news,abortion,political,general news,society,community,ethical issues,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,medical treatments,procedures,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 20:16:00", "news_title": "Fire Rages Near Yosemite National Park ", "content": "A massive blaze near Yosemite National Park has forced thousands to abandon small towns and blanketed the region with smoke all the way to southern Idaho and northern Nevada, hundreds of miles from the California fire.As of Friday, the 74,000-acre Detwiler Fire, about 30 miles from Yosemite, has so far destroyed 58 homes and 60 other structures on the outskirts of the nearby town of Mariposa, Calif., since it started July 16.On Friday, more than 2,000 residents ordered to evacuate Mariposa on Tuesday were allowed to return home, according to state fire officials. Evacuation orders were still in place for around 3,000 residents of two neighboring towns. Around 3,800 firefighters and almost 500 fire engines are combating the blaze.Firefighters caught a break Tuesday when temperatures cooled to 91 from 100 degrees and stayed put through Wednesday, which allowed them to dig containment lines in previously more active parts of the fire.That window is quickly closing, however, as temperatures are expected to climb from 93 Friday to 100 by Sunday. The hotter temperature, mixed with dry and windy conditions, will only make the fire more fierce and unpredictable, fire officials said.\u201cThe weather has everything to do with how this will be fought,\u201d Cal Fire Director Ken Pimlott said. \u201cWe\u2019re cautiously optimistic, but the bottom line is, we\u2019re certainly not out of the woods on this fire.\u201dFirefighters have been able to shift their focus from protecting Mariposa to increasing containment of the fire. Their eyes are now on Coulterville and Greeley to the north, which sit on the direction of the fire\u2019s spread.Smoke can be seen from Yosemite, about 30 miles northeast of Mariposa. The park is sufficiently out of harm\u2019s way, though, and will continue to operate normally, a Yosemite spokeswoman said.About 50 of the park\u2019s employees who live in Mariposa have been displaced because of the fire, the spokeswoman said.The last major fire near Yosemite was the 257,000-acre Rim Fire in 2013, one of the state\u2019s largest fires yet.Though the Detwiler fire isn\u2019t as big as the 2013 blaze, its rate and volatility of spread are a major concern for Cal Fire. The Detwiler fire is spreading at a much faster rate thanks to an abundance of vegetation that acts as additional fuel for the flames.A wet winter season has promoted grass to grow as tall as 6 feet in some parts of the state.       Mr. Pimlott       said. By the time the summer came, all of the new vegetation dried up, becoming effective kindling.\u201cThese are some very extreme, erratic, fast-moving fire behavior,\u201d Mr. Pimlott said. \u201cMany in this area haven't seen fire conditions like this.\u201dMr. Pimlott said Cal Fire is seeing more frequent and more destructive grass fires. Since the beginning of July, the state has seen 50 new fires daily, Mr. Pimlott said.It is part of a \u201csustained pattern,\u201d Mr. Pimlott said, as grass fires become more common around the state.\u201cWe\u2019re no longer saying this is unprecedented,\u201d Mr. Pimlott said. \u201cThis is the new normal.

The letter also said they were prepared to fight a subpoena and invoke Mr. Simpson\u2019s constitutional right not to give testimony if compelled to appear.Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and the committee\u2019s top Democrat,       Dianne Feinstein,        in a joint statement said: \u201cGlenn Simpson, through his attorney, has declined to voluntarily attend Wednesday\u2019s Judiciary Committee hearing regarding compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Therefore, a subpoena has been issued to compel his attendance. Simpson\u2019s attorney has asserted that his client will invoke his Fifth Amendment rights in response to the subpoena.\u201dThe letter explaining Mr. Simpson\u2019s refusal to appear cites his obligations to keep his client information confidential and his First Amendment right under the Constitution to engage in political speech and political activity. The Fifth Amendment allows witnesses to refuse to give testimony on matters that could incriminate them.Mr. Grassley and Ms. Feinstein said they would compel witnesses to appear at a hearing scheduled for July 26 on the topic of foreign influence peddling if they refuse to appear voluntarily.In addition to Mr. Simpson, the committee has summoned      Paul Manafort,        Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for several months in 2016, and Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, to next week\u2019s hearing, along with Russia sanctions activist and businessman Bill Browder. The Judiciary Committee said Messrs. Trump Jr. and Manafort are providing documents to the committee and are still negotiating the terms of their testimonies.Congressional subpoenas are mandatory summonses to appear before Congress, but the legislature has had difficulty enforcing them in the past. Congress typically needs either assistance from a federal court or the Justice Department to help compel a witness who defies a congressional subpoena. A procedure allowing congressional law-enforcement officials to take a witness into custody hasn\u2019t been used in decades.Mr. Simpson\u2019s testimony is of interest to investigators because of his firm\u2019s work with former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. Fusion GPS hired Mr. Steele to conduct opposition research on Mr. Trump, resulting in a 35-page dossier that was widely shared in political and media circles during and after the 2016 election. Intelligence agencies made the existence of the dossier known to Mr. Trump in a January meeting. The dossier contains unverified information mostly about Mr. Trump\u2019s activities and engagement with Russians.In addition to the dossier compiled on Mr. Trump, Mr. Grassley has alleged that Mr. Simpson\u2019s firm has worked with a Russian-American lobbyist on a campaign against a package of Russian sanctions that was being considered by Congress. That lobbyist was present in a meeting in Trump Tower in June 2016 with the younger Mr. Trump.Mr. Grassley has raised questions about whether Mr. Simpson\u2019s firm should have registered as a foreign agent for its work on the Russia sanctions. Mr. Simpson\u2019s attorney called those questions and allegations \u201cnothing more than an effort to smear him and his firm.\u201dQuestioning of the younger Mr. Trump and Mr. Manafort is expected to focus in part on an email chain discovered this month that showed the younger Mr. Trump helped arrange a Trump Tower meeting with a group of Russian advocates after being promised allegedly damaging information about former Democratic presidential nominee       Hillary Clinton,        which he was told was provided by the Kremlin. The meeting was also attended by Messrs. Kushner and Manafort.The gathering has come to the attention of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election and the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Russia has denied it interfered in the election, and Mr. Trump has said he and his campaign didn\u2019t engage in collusion.A Russian attorney,       Natalia Veselnitskaya,        who also attended the meeting, has said she used the gathering to advocate against sanctions on Russia.The president\u2019s son has said the meeting didn\u2019t result in any significant exchange of information or action.Messrs. Kushner and Manafort have said they are cooperating with the investigation.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-judiciary-committee-subpoenas-founder-of-firm-behind-trump-dossier-1500682608", "keywords": [" christopher steele,donald trump, dossier, glenn simpson, russia investigation,Senate Judiciary Committee,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 20:05:00", "news_title": "Earnings Boost S&P 500 for the Week   ", "content": "The S&P 500 inched lower Friday but held on to a weekly gain as signs of health in corporate profits boosted shares.With major indexes holding near records, some investors and analysts said continued gains will depend on robust earnings. Reports so far have generally been solid, said       David Lefkowitz,        senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas.\u201cThe initial read here looks pretty favorable,\u201d Mr. Lefkowitz said. \u201cThere are always pockets of strengths and weakness within earnings season, but overall it\u2019s been more strength than weakness.\u201dThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 31.71 points, or 0.1%, on Friday to 21580.07, finishing the week down 0.3% and snapping a two-week streak of gains.The S&P 500 declined 0.91 point, or less than 0.1%, on Friday to 2472.54, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.25 points, or less than 0.1%, to 6387.75.Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended higher for the week\u2014up 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively\u2014and near records, though Friday\u2019s declines ended the Nasdaq\u2019s 10-session winning streak. It was the tech-heavy index\u2019s longest such streak since February 2015.Losses in energy shares weighed on the S&P 500 Friday, as U.S. crude for August delivery fell 2.5% to $45.77 a barrel amid concerns that oil exporters won\u2019t stick to output cuts. Oil dropped 2.1% for the week.Energy stocks in the S&P 500 fell 0.9% Friday and are down roughly 14% in 2017.Technology stocks in the S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1% Friday, concluding a week in which the index\u2019s tech sector reached a new high for the first time in almost 20 years.Tech shares have gained 23% this year, making the sector the best-performer in the S&P 500.Some analysts said tech stocks remain attractive because of the ability of those companies to increase earnings even in times of tepid economic growth.Microsoft                   shares slipped 43 cents, or 0.6%, to $73.79 Friday, despite posting a jump in profit after the market closed Thursday that beat analysts\u2019 projections.Earlier in the week, shares of             Netflix,       which is classified as a consumer stock in the S&P 500 but often grouped with highflying technology firms, had their best day of the year after the streaming giant beat its subscriber-growth estimate.Facebook                   and             Amazon.com                   have flirted with share-price milestones this past week ahead of coming earnings reports. Amazon, also technically a consumer stock, ended with a rise of 2.4% for the week and influenced major stock moves on Thursday after             Sears Holdingsannounced it would sell Kenmore appliances directly on the e-commerce giant\u2019s website. The news dragged down other appliance sellers, such as Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, on Thursday.Earnings reports drove some of the biggest stock moves in Friday\u2019s trading.The shares of             eBay                   dropped 57 cents, or 1.5%, to 36.61 Friday after the e-commerce company late Thursday reported earnings that were largely in line with Wall Street\u2019s expectations.Shares of Dow component             General Electric                   declined 78 cents, or 2.9%, to 25.91 after the company reported a smaller-than-expected fall in earnings. Many analysts are skeptical that the industrial giant can meet its future financial targets.Cintas                   gained 11.65, or 9.2%, to 138.43 and             Capital One                   added 6.93, or 8.6%, to 87.94 Friday after both companies\u2019 earnings beat analysts\u2019 expectations.Although the companies that have reported their quarterly results so far have had larger increases than Wall Street anticipated, some investors caution that future projections might be getting too optimistic.\u201cWe need strong earnings growth to see the rally continue, and we\u2019re not sure we\u2019re going to get that,\u201d said       Jeroen Blokland,        a senior portfolio manager at Dutch asset manager Robeco.Investors also kept a close eye on central-bank meetings in Europe and Japan this past week. Many expect global central banks to move slowly when withdrawing their monetary stimulus because of weak economic growth, providing favorable conditions for stocks and bonds.The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.232%, from 2.266% Thursday, posting its largest two-week decline since March. Yields fall as bond prices rise.Utilities shares, known as bond proxies because they pay relatively high dividends, were the best-performing S&P 500 sector on Friday, rising 0.8% to post a weekly gain of 2.6%.The euro rose 0.3% against the dollar Friday to $1.1666, for its highest late New York level since January 2015, a day after leaping 1% when European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi       reaffirmed his confidence in the eurozone economy.The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, ended down 0.3% Friday, recording its lowest close since September.\u201cWe have Goldilocks growth prospects with improving economic fundamentals, but inflation is missing in action. That allows central banks to go cautiously in terms of normalizing monetary policy,\u201d said       Arnab Das,        head of EMEA and emerging-market macro research at Invesco Fixed Income.Elsewhere, European stocks were broadly lower, dragged down by a fall in auto and construction stocks.

The issue hasn\u2019t been reported before, and it isn\u2019t known why the crew failed to call up the instrument system for backup during the visual landing prior to breaking off the approach.In addition, the incident posed a greater hazard than initially believed to four planes filled with passengers and lined up on the taxiway to take off, because revised estimates indicate the closest separation may have been significantly less than 100 feet.Pilots of the Airbus A320 jet, arriving from Toronto just before midnight on July 7, lined up to land on a taxiway parallel to their designated runway. They continued the approach despite one of the pilots commenting about what appeared to be unexpected lights on the tarmac in front of them.U.S. and Canadian investigators previously said in separate statements that the jet, carrying 140 people, passed over roughly the first quarter-mile of the taxiway, descended to less than 100 feet above the ground and ended up flying over the first taxiing jet before safely climbing away.The latest estimates peg the closest separation between 70 feet and less than 30 feet, according to two people familiar with the details, though that could change.Nobody was hurt and Air Canada flight 759 landed safely after pulling up and circling around. But safety experts described the event as potentially catastrophic, with the A320 swooping toward three large             Boeing                   787s and a smaller Boeing 737 crammed with passengers before heeding a last-second instruction from a controller to climb.The heads of Canada\u2019s Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is heading up the probe, declined to comment Thursday, when asked about the investigation on the sidelines of a pilot-union safety conference. The airline has said it is cooperating with investigators but declined to provide details about the incident. A spokesman for the union that represents Air Canada pilots declined to comment.The incident is unusual partly because taxiway lights are different colors than those used universally to mark the edges and centerlines of runways. Commercial pilots consider it second nature to break off an approach and climb away from an airport if they have any suspicions a plane, vehicle or other obstruction is on the runway.Roughly a mile from the airport, one of the pilots told the tower \u201cI can see lights on the runway there,\u201d and then asked for confirmation of clearance to land, according to unofficial audio of communications archived online. Moments later, after the controller confirmed there were no other planes on the runway and with the landing jet skimming over the planes on the taxiway, a pilot in one of aircraft said: \u201cWhere is this guy going? He\u2019s on the taxiway.\u201dThe San Francisco airport has parallel runways located unusually close to each other, and part of the cockpit confusion may have been prompted by the fact that one of those strips was closed and its lights were off, according to people familiar with the investigation. So the crew, expecting to see two sets of parallel lights, apparently mistook illumination on the taxiway for runway lights.The pilots and the San Francisco tower controller who instructed the plane to go around for another landing attempt have been interviewed by NTSB investigators, but so far nothing has been released. The controller may have been distracted by another task after clearing the Air Canada jet to land, according to one person familiar with the details.John Cox, an industry consultant and ex-commercial aviator who previously headed the safety organization for the union that still represents Air Canada pilots, said \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d could have been a factor. The pilots were used to seeing parallel lighting during the approach, according to Mr. Cox, and convinced themselves what they observed conformed to that expectation.San Francisco\u2019s closely spaced runways are known among pilots for sometimes creating traffic delays and difficult landing approaches in low visibility, but that doesn\u2019t seem to have been a factor this time.Pilots landing on the wrong runway or mistakenly flying over a runway rank among the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s top safety issues when it comes to air-traffic control. But instances of airliners attempting to land on taxiways are rare.In 2009, a             Delta Air Lines Inc.       cockpit crew mistakenly landed a big jet on a taxiway at Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport in good weather and visibility, but nobody was hurt. The mistake occurred before dawn, after a 10-hour flight from South America, and with the crew distracted by a medical issue affecting one of the pilots.Investigators in the San Francisco incident are trying to determine, among other things, whether fatigue or distraction may have played a role.Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/air-canada-pilots-reportedly-werent-using-normal-navigation-aids-in-close-call-at-san-francisco-1500667932", "keywords": [" airbus a320,air canada, air canada close call,air canada flight ac759, air canada july 7 incident, air canada san francisco,faa, flight ac759, national transportation safety board, ntsb, runway lights , taxiway, transportation safety board,Air Canada,AC.T,AC.A.T,corporate,industrial news,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,airports,air transport,transportation,logistics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 19:39:00", "news_title": "GE Leaves Investors in Limbo", "content": "General Electric Co.        GE 0.59%      , a company in transition that also is changing its CEO, told investors Friday that they would have to wait four months to hear the new boss\u2019s strategy for boosting results.GE investors, who have missed out on the broader stock market\u2019s rally, were in no mood to be patient. Shares of the Boston-based conglomerate fell nearly 3%, leaving the stock 18% below where it started the year.GE, its profits under pressure, improved its cash flow and ramped up cost-cutting efforts\u2014two areas of investor concern\u2014in Chief Executive       Jeff Immelt\u2019s       last quarter at the helm. The bad news from investors\u2019 point of view was that GE tempered profit expectations for the current year and said investors would have to wait until mid-November for CEO-designate       John Flannery       to discuss the outlook for 2018.It is unusual for a big company, especially one such as GE that is being pressured by an activist investor to improve its performance, to ask shareholders and customers to wait so long to learn about its game plan.\u201cThis is a strange situation,\u201d said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with William Blair & Co. \u201cThis increases the duration of the period of uncertainty.\u201dOn a conference call Friday, analyst Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets asked if GE would be in \u201climbo\u201d until November. Mr. Flannery said the financial framework for 2017 is set and that he is \u201cnot worried that we\u2019re going to be, you know, dead in the water in the meantime.\u201dMr. Immelt will step down at the end of this month after 16 years as CEO.GE is under increasing pressure to show that its pivot away from financial services, big bets on the oil industry and a renewed focus on making jet engines and power turbines would be good for investors.Shares fell 2.9% to $25.91 each in Friday trading.Mr. Flannery, who formerly ran GE\u2019s health-care unit, is meeting with small groups of investors and visiting the business units of the roughly 300,000-person company.Jeffrey Bornstein,        GE\u2019s chief financial officer, defended the timeline in an interview and said the company would have to \u201cplay through\u201d any uncertainty created by a review that includes \u201ctesting everything we believe.\u201d\u201cThe notion that [Mr. Flannery] is going to get his arms around this in a month is a fallacy,\u201d Mr. Bornstein said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think asking for four or five months to do this is asking a lot.\u201dOn Friday, GE backed its prior 2017 projection of earnings of $1.60 to $1.70 a share and organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, but it warned that profit would be on the weak side. \u201cGiven our outlook on oil and gas and power, we are trending to the bottom end of the range,\u201d Mr. Bornstein said on the conference call.Analysts are skeptical that GE will reach a goal of delivering $2 a share in profit in 2018, but the company said an updated target wouldn\u2019t come until after Mr. Flannery\u2019s review.\u201cThis was almost like a funeral dirge today. There was nothing positive,\u201d said Brian Langenberg, industry strategist at Langenberg & Co. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything in November that is going to make me thrilled.\u201dAlso Friday, industrial conglomerate             Honeywell International Inc.        HON 0.90%       reported a stronger quarterly profit and raised the low end of its 2017 earnings outlook. The company is also conducting a review of its portfolio under new CEO       Darius Adamczyk       which it expects to complete in late September or early October.\u201cWe are very conscious of not letting this slow us down,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer       Tom Szlosek       in an interview. \u201cWe think we do a good job of keeping our businesses out of it.\u201dStrength in its aerospace division as well as its home and building-technologies business helped Honeywell\u2019s latest results. The company\u2019s profit rose 6% to $1.4 billion in the second quarter, while revenue climbed about 1% to $10.08 billion.Honeywell shares gained 1% to $136.35 Friday, leaving it up 18% for the year.Both GE and Honeywell are facing pressure from activist investors. GE pledged to boost its cost-cutting program earlier this year after discussions with Trian Fund Management LP, which has been frustrated by missed profit goals at GE. Third Point LLC has called on Honeywell to explore selling or splitting off its aerospace business.On Friday, GE said it cut $593 million in annual industrial costs in the second quarter and is on track to meet or beat its $1 billion savings goal by the end of the year. It has eliminated $670 million in spending this year.Despite re-examining its spending, GE said it won\u2019t consider reducing its dividend payout, which Mr. Bornstein called the company\u2019s \u201csingle most important capital allocation item.\u201dCash flow in GE\u2019s industrial segment was a positive $1.5 billion after a shocking negative $1.6 billion for the first quarter. The company backed its full-year cash-flow target of $12 billion to $14 billion but said it would also be at the low end of the projected range.In all, GE\u2019s second-quarter earnings fell less than expected, with much of the drop reflecting a year-earlier boost from the sale of its home-appliances business. The company reported a profit of $1.19 billion, or 15 cents a share, down from $2.76 billion, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.

Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, expecting to repurchase them at lower prices and collect the difference as profit.Bearish investors say they are scaling back on these bets not because their view of the market has fundamentally changed, but because it is difficult to stick to a money-losing strategy when it seems stocks can only go up.They believe the market moves are at odds with an economy that remains lukewarm as it enters its ninth year of growth, stock valuations that are historically high and a delay of business-friendly policies in Washington like tax cuts and infrastructure spending.\u201cThere seems to be an overall view that people are invincible, that things will always go up, that there are no risks and no matter what goes on, no matter what foolishness is in play, people don\u2019t care,\u201d said Marc Cohodes, whose hedge fund focused on shorting stocks closed in 2008.Mr. Cohodes is now a chicken farmer based in California who is looking to get into goat herding in Canada. He shorts a handful of individual stocks personally, but isn\u2019t focused on the broader market.The practice of shorting companies is also going by the wayside as stocks continue to notch records. Short-biased hedge funds had $4.3 billion in assets at the end of March, down from $7.1 billion at the end of 2013, according to HFR Inc.The difficulty for stock-market bears stems from a Goldilocks-like market environment, in which the economy is expanding fast enough to support corporate earnings, but slow enough for the Federal Reserve to keep rates relatively low. Years of low rates and easy-money policies have boosted stocks, defying forecasts for a steep, prolonged downturn.\u201cThe shorts have been frustrated now for quite a while,\u201d said Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, which has $260 billion in assets under management. The scenarios that might lead to a payout for market bears\u2014an economic recession or a sharp rise in interest rates\u2014don\u2019t seem imminent, either, Mr. Minerd added.In one sign of capitulation among the bears, stock pullbacks have been getting shorter.This year, there have been two times when the S&P 500 has closed down 1% or more. After these two selloffs, it has taken stocks an average of 14.5 days to recoup losses. That is well below the 25.5 days it took on average to bounce back from stretches of 1%-plus selloffs in 2016 and the 80 days it took to rebound in 2015, according to an analysis by WSJ Market Data Group.The share of individual investors who are either bullish or bearish has also fallen in recent months, according to a weekly survey by the American Association of Individual Investors, while the share of those who are neutral has risen. As of the end of June, 43% of investors said they were neutral\u2014the most since last August.\u201cThe danger is that you\u2019re too early getting out,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management, which has $246 billion under management.The issue for investors, Mr. Ramos said, is that there remain few compelling alternatives to stocks.Bond yields have remained stubbornly low this year, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ending Friday at 2.232%, down from 2.446% at the end of 2016.Central banks around the world in recent weeks have signaled they will move toward normalizing monetary policy, nudging bond yields higher. But few investors believe inflation will pick up so much that the Fed will be pressured into lifting rates faster than it has forecast\u2014a scenario that could lead to sharp market losses.At the same time, many who are invested in stocks are wary of signs that the bull market\u2019s days are numbered.Valuations have risen to levels many investors say are stretched, with the S&P 500 trading this week at 17.86 times the next 12 months of expected earnings, according to FactSet, above its 10-year average of 14.06 times forward earnings.Still, some who believe excesses are growing in the financial system say it is hard to convey those concerns to average investors. While signs of a housing bubble in the middle part of the last decade were abundant, indications that borrowing by companies will lead to a wave of defaults are more nuanced, said Albert Edwards, a strategist at             Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA      . Mr. Edwards has been bearish for most of the bull market and believes a corporate-debt binge will ultimately lead to a deeper bear market than in the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cIt\u2019s much harder this time to see the corporate-debt excesses,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a headline catcher. You have to be a bit geeky to pull apart the data and analyze it.\u201dDespite persistent concerns that investment-grade corporate bonds and junk debt are pricey, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of credit investors found that none of the respondents were significantly underweight either sector.In the week ended July 19, investors piled $4.6 billion into global equity funds, marking the eighth consecutive week of inflows for such funds, according to EPFR data.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of worry out there, but the market just keeps going up,\u201d Mr. Ramos said. \u201cWhen everyone agrees that it\u2019s time for this bull market to keep going, that\u2019s exactly the right time for the market rally to stop.\u201d\u2014Peter Levin and Charley Grant contributed to this article.Write to Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Short Sellers Retreat Amid Rally.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/short-sellers-give-up-as-stocks-run-to-new-records-1500629404", "keywords": ["bear market,economic news,how long can stocks keep rising,markets news,nyse,short interest,short selling,stock news,u.s. stock futures,political,general news,investment ideas,investor education,personal finance,personal investments,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 19:36:00", "news_title": "U.S. Drops Case Against \u2018London Whale\u2019 Traders ", "content": "Federal prosecutors said they will drop charges against two former             J.P.

Morgan trader who came to be known as the London whale for his outsize trading positions. A lawyer for Mr. Iksil couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment Friday evening.A spokesman for J.P. Morgan declined to comment.Charges are to be dismissed against       Javier Martin-Artajo       and       Julien Grout,        who faced charges including conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud for their alleged role in a conspiracy to conceal losses sustained through a series of disastrous derivatives trades.Law-enforcement officials brought charges in 2013 after probing whether traders in J.P. Morgan\u2019s chief investment office knowingly misvalued their positions to hide or understate losses as they piled up, according to people familiar with the investigations.The two men, who no longer work at the bank, still face civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.A lawyer for Mr. Martin-Artajo declined to comment, citing the pending case with the SEC.       Ed Little,        a lawyer for Mr. Grout, said he and his client \u201care thrilled that after four long years of tough litigation, the government has finally decided to dismiss the case, and we thank them for their decency and professionalism.\u201dU.S. prosecutors were among several regulatory and law-enforcement agencies trying to determine responsibility for the trading losses, which took place in a London outpost of the bank\u2019s chief investment office.In 2013, J.P. Morgan agreed to pay at least $800 million in fines to settle claims by U.K. and U.S. regulators stemming from the bank\u2019s role in the trades.Neither Mr. Martin-Artajo nor Mr. Grout ever appeared in a U.S. court to face the federal criminal charges. In April 2015, a Spanish court rejected prosecutors\u2019 request to extradite Mr. Martin-Artajo, who is a Spanish citizen. On Friday, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s office said efforts to extradite Mr. Grout, a French citizen, from France \u201cwould have been futile.\u201dThe office said recent comments by Mr. Iksil led it to conclude it \u201cno longer believes that it can rely on the testimony of Iksil in prosecuting this case, even if the defendants appeared.\u201dMr. Iksil\u2014who earned the nickname in the market for his outsize derivative positions before the losses came to light\u2014signed a nonprosecution agreement with the Justice Department in 2013 and agreed to give evidence against his two former colleagues. He had also been helping the SEC investigation.In recent months, Mr. Iksil has spoken publicly about the case in the press, telling Financial News that he was writing a book and planned to launch a website to tell \u201cthe full story\u201d of the trading scandal.Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve chose not to go forward with legal action against Mr. Iksil for his role.

Israeli police said they were investigating the reports of Palestinian deaths.Israel installed the metal detectors outside the site in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City after three gunmen killed two Israeli police officers last week. The gunmen were subsequently shot and killed by security forces.On Friday, a Palestinian attacker stabbed three Israelis to death in a West Bank Jewish settlement and wounded a fourth, according to Israeli rescue workers.\u2018There shouldn\u2019t be a problem in placing metal detectors like they are also placed in Mecca and the Vatican.\u2019He was shot and wounded by police after entering a private Israeli home in the settlement of Halamish near Ramallah and stabbing residents inside, the Israeli Defense Forces said.The IDF circulated a Facebook post that identified the attacker as Omer Alabed. \u201cI am not 20 yet. I had many dreams but what life is this where our children, women and men are killed and holy places are discriminated,\u201d it read.Hamas, the militant group that governs the Gaza Strip, praised the attack, calling it a \u201cnormal\u201d response to Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank.Earlier in the day Israeli officials said at least four policemen were injured as Palestinian protesters threw rocks, fireworks and Molotov cocktails at security forces in East Jerusalem.Israeli police said they have arrested more than two dozen rioters.\u201cI declare the suspension of all contacts with the Israeli side on all levels until it cancels its measures at Al Aqsa mosque and preserves the status quo,\u201d Mr. Abbas said after meeting his aides, referring to the mosque on the Noble Sanctuary. Mr. Abbas also called on the United Nations to protect Palestinians.The Israeli government had no immediate comment on Mr. Abbas\u2019s declaration. Israelis and the Palestinian Authority cooperate on a range of issues from security coordination to financial transfers and it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how those exchanges would be affected by Mr. Abbas\u2019s pronouncement.U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres \u201curges Israeli and Palestinian leaders to refrain from actions that could further escalate the situation and calls on all political, religious and community leaders to help reduce tension,\u201d his spokesman said in a statement. Mr. Guterres also called for a full investigation of Friday\u2019s deaths and said \u201cthe sanctity of religious sites should be respected as places for reflection, not violence.\u201dDespite the pockets of violence, worshipers had dispersed following midday prayers on the Temple Mount and all roads in the historic area were open, police said. Security was heightened in and around the Old City to prevent further incidents, it said, adding police and Israeli border patrol were prepared to step in as necessary.Muslims in the Palestinian territories and several countries around the world have protested Israel\u2019s installation of metal detectors at the Temple Mount gates. Many Muslims say they view the measure as Israel imposing its control and changing the status quo at the site.Israel says its additional security measures aimed to improve security at the site and would remain as long as necessary.\u201cLast week\u2019s terror attack crossed a red line and was an attempt to harm the sensitive fabric of the Temple Mount,\u201d Israeli Police Chief Roni Alsheich told Israel Radio on Friday.Ya\u2019acov Perry, a member of parliament and former Israeli intelligence chief, on Thursday dismissed concerns about the security measures. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be a problem in placing metal detectors like they are also placed in Mecca and the Vatican,\u201d he said.The Temple Mount, or Noble Sanctuary, has long been a flashpoint for violence between Palestinians and Israeli security forces. The compound is the site of the Western Wall, considered one of Judaism\u2019s holiest sites, and Al Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third-holiest after the Saudi cities Mecca and Medina.The last major wave of Temple Mount-related violence broke out in September 2015, partly amid Palestinian claims that Israel was encroaching on the plaza and seeking to change the longtime status quo over access to it. The bloodshed left hundreds dead, many of them Palestinians.The new security measures have been criticized by the Waqf, a Muslim religious authority overseen by Jordan that administers the Temple Mount with Israel\u2019s support. Its representatives have refused to pass through the metal detectors and called on other worshipers to pray outside the gates until Israel removes them, raising tensions in the area around the site this week.Israel deployed additional police around the Temple Mount site on Friday after Palestinian factions called for a \u201cday of rage\u201d to protest the metal detectors. It also barred Palestinian men under the age of 50 from entering the Temple Mount on Friday, in a bid to prevent violence.\u2014Abu Bakr Bashir in Gaza City contributed to this article.Appeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Amid Violence, Palestinian Leader Cuts Ties to Israel.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/palestinian-leader-mahmoud-abbas-calls-for-cutting-ties-to-israel-1500674425", "keywords": ["jerusalem,middle east conflict, temple mount,political,general news,civil unrest,national,public security,risk news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 19:09:00", "news_title": "Reformers Not Welcome at Ex-Im Bank", "content": "In an era of polarization, taxpayers can take no solace that crony capitalism still enjoys bipartisan support. Witness the confirmation battle over President       Trump\u2019s       nominee to be president of the Export-Import Bank\u2014      Scott Garrett,        one of the bank\u2019s longtime critics.As a New Jersey Congressman, Mr. Garrett twice voted against renewing Ex-Im\u2019s charter. To encourage exports, the bank offers loans, guarantees and other financing, but as Mr. Garrett explained, this support has become \u201ctaxpayer-funded welfare for mega-corporations.\u201d He also noted the bank habitually \u201crewards those with close relations to Washington bureaucrats.\u201d Washington\u2019s beneficiaries weren\u2019t pleased.Ex-Im claims to back small businesses, but in 2014\u2014the last year the bank was fully operational\u2014the two biggest recipients of financial help were             Boeing                   ($8.4 billion) and             General Electric                   ($2.6 billion). A year later, as Congress debated whether to let the bank\u2019s charter expire, the two corporations spent $43 million lobbying.Congress renewed the charter in December 2015, though the Senate Banking Committee\u2019s last chairman, Republican Sen.       Richard Shelby,        blocked President       Obama\u2019s       nominees to the board, denying Ex-Im the three-person quorum needed to approve any financing deal over $10 million.Ex-Im claims to be a lender of last resort, but in 2013 one of Boeing\u2019s top financing executives reassured customers it could find alternative funding sources even without the bank\u2019s backing. Sure enough, Boeing\u2019s 2017 annual outlook highlighted \u201chealthy aircraft financing markets,\u201d estimating export credits will supply only 10% of its $126 billion financing for global commercial airline deliveries this year.Private financing may cost more, but at least taxpayer money isn\u2019t then staked on cut-rate loans for risky business. Before its demise in 2011, Solyndra, the solar-panel company, snagged $10 million in Ex-Im financing. Over the Obama years Ex-Im approved $2.1 billion for renewable energy, a political favorite.The bank\u2019s supporters defend such risk-taking by boasting that Ex-Im investments will yield a $14 billion profit between 2015 and 2024. But the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the bank would report a $2 billion loss if it were held to the same fair-value accounting standards as private business.During one five-year stretch in the Obama years, 46 public employees were convicted of defrauding the bank (or, to be more accurate, American taxpayers). One bribed loan officer recommended that the bank back a company that had repeatedly defaulted on past Ex-Im guarantees, costing nearly $20 million. None of these entrenched problems are surprising, given that Ex-Im exists to dispense government privilege to some businesses and not others.The taxpayer guarantees must be valuable because the fury against Mr. Garrett is something to behold. In a recent op-ed in these pages,       Jay Timmons,        president of the National Association of Manufacturers, claimed Mr. Garrett \u201cisn\u2019t a reformer; he\u2019s a destroyer.\u201d Even more overwrought, Mr. Timmons claimed Mr. Garrett\u2019s past opposition to the bank was \u201ctantamount to a vicious trade war against American manufacturing workers.\u201dCalm down, Jay. Mr. Trump has also nominated former Alabama Rep.       Spencer Bachus       to the Ex-Im board, and its governing structure would limit Mr. Garrett\u2019s power. Mr. Bachus, who voted to renew Ex-Im\u2019s charter in 2012, is seen as less hardline than Mr. Garrett, and the confirmation of either nominee would give the Ex-Im bank the quorum it needs to keep passing out large-scale cash, even with a reformer\u2019s dissenting votes.But at least Mr. Garrett can alert Congress and the public when Ex-Im\u2019s dealings stink. Like any President, Mr. Trump deserves to have his nominees approved unless they are crooked or inept. It\u2019s revealing that Mr. Garrett\u2019s opponents fear that he\u2019s too competent.Appeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/reformers-not-welcome-at-ex-im-bank-1500678548", "keywords": ["political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,editorials"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 19:07:00", "news_title": "Joseph Rago", "content": "These columns are a collaborative effort, but some writers collaborate more than others.

But his particular contribution was on health care and the long debate over ObamaCare.On this and other issues he was a reporter\u2019s opinion writer: He read everything on the subject, from academic literature on insurance markets to scientific papers on new drugs as he fought the Food and Drug Administration for faster approvals for patients. He had sources from industry, Capitol Hill, think tanks and HHS.Joe had to persuade himself of what he thought before he could write to persuade others. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 2011 for his health-care editorials, but he knew it is folly to write for prizes.

He wanted a mini-fridge.He dispatched a top aide to a nearby executive office building where junior research employees are crammed into a room, surviving on Lean Cuisine frozen lunches. Mr. Spicer wants your icebox, the aide said, according to people familiar with the incident. They refused to give it up.So Mr. Spicer waited until sundown\u2014after his young staffers had left\u2014to take matters into his own hands. He was spotted by a fellow White House official lugging the icebox down the White House driveway after 8 p.m.From the very start, Mr. Spicer faced myriad challenges in his role as President       Donald Trump\u2019s       chief spokesman, a job he quit on Friday. And each obstacle\u2014from defending a president who often contradicted him, to securing a fridge for his own office\u2014seemed to be a struggle.A veteran Republican communications operative in Washington, Mr. Spicer was well-liked inside the White House, but never fully won the respect of some members of his staff, or, ultimately, his boss. He became a household name almost overnight\u2014a double-edged sword in a White House where the president, who made his fortune in marketing, is keenly aware of how he and his team are portrayed in the media. \u200bIn a statement read by White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in the Friday afternoon briefing, Mr. Trump said he was \u201cgrateful\u201d for Mr. Spicer\u2019s service and wished him future success, joking, \u201cjust look at his great television ratings.\u201dBut Mr. Spicer\u2019s troubles started on the very first week on the job.Mr. Spicer introduced himself to the nation the day after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration when he summoned White House reporters for an impromptu Saturday briefing, in which he delivered a stunning rant at reporters, complaining that the national media described Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd as smaller than that of his predecessor\u2019s, former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       in 2009.He complained that the media \u201cintentionally framed\u201d photographs to make Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cenormous support\u201d appear smaller. He used inaccurate numbers to describe Mr. Obama\u2019s inaugural crowd, and said Mr. Trump seemed to draw fewer people because of ground coverings that had never been used before.\u201cThese attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. After speaking for six minutes, he left the podium without taking questions.Mr. Spicer\u2019s continued uneven performance\u2014he once referred to concentration camps as \u201cholocaust centers\u201d\u2014and the constant stream of news from Mr. Trump\u2019s administration combined to create must-see afternoon TV for millions of viewers across the country.He was also out of sync with the president on a pivotal story for the administration: the firing of former FBI Director       James Comey.       Mr. Spicer said he was terminated because of a performance memo from the Justice Department; Mr. Trump within days said he fired the director because he was a \u201cshowboat.\u201dThe high-profile role made him one of the most recognized faces in the Trump administration, and one of the first on the new White House team who was parodied on Saturday Night Live. The Spicer character, played by Melissa McCarthy, became a recurring bit on the late-night comedy show.The SNL character was used against him inside the White House and among Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, including       Anthony Scaramucci,        who was named communications director on Friday. The incoming communications director referred to Mr. Spicer as \u201cMelissa McCarthy\u201d to people within the White House, according to administration officials.The hiring of Mr. Scaramucci was the reason Mr. Spicer quit, he told those officials.The White House communications team was summoned to Mr. Spicer\u2019s West Wing office on Friday, where Mr. Spicer thanked his staff, and promised to help with the transition. The team gave him a round of applause.Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff who also opposed Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s hiring, introduced the new hire. Messers. Scaramucci leaned in to hug Mr. Spicer, who awkwardly put his arms around Mr. Scaramucci without touching him, said two people who witnessed the exchange.

SLB -0.03%      , the world\u2019s largest oil-field service firm, said Friday.Paal Kibsgaard,        an outspoken energy executive based in Paris, blamed the surge in U.S. drilling for crude prices that are mired below $50 a barrel.\u201cWhat we are currently witnessing is that the U.S. equity investors and U.S. companies have spooked the market,\" he told analysts and investors on a call to discuss the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings.Increased drilling and fracking of oil and gas wells around North America is both blessing and curse for Schlumberger. The uptick in activity helped the company beat analyst estimates with its quarterly report on Thursday, but lower energy prices jeopardize some of its customers\u2019 operations.Analysts zero in on Schlumberger\u2019s financial results because it is typically the first major energy company to report in each earnings season and serves as bellwether for the oil industry.U.S. private-equity investors continue to pour cash into U.S. shale basins encouraging new drilling despite the fact that the companies receiving the funds are unprofitable, Mr. Kibsgaard said.Despite the new supplies of oil flooding into an over-supplied market, Mr. Kibsgaard thinks the price of oil would rise if the market shakes its current negative sentiment and focuses on fundamentals. He noted that global inventories continue to fall following a renewed agreement to cut production in May by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Market sentiment has been \u201cirrational\u201d in focusing on increases in U.S. oil output, which have only slowed the depletion of oil reserves, according to Mr. Kibsgaard.Fueled by the Wall Street cash, drillers are on pace this year to break the all-time U.S. oil production record, despite a 12% plunge in prices since April. Investors have injected more than $57 billion into the sector over the last 18 months, even as many shale companies drift further from profitability.U.S production will top 10 million barrels a day by early next year if not sooner, according to government projections and several investment banks and analysts. This trend is \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d to cuts in production made by OPEC, undermining oil prices, Mr.\u00a0Kibsgaard said.Mr. Kibsgaard \u00a0is the second chief executive of a major energy company to implore Wall Street to show restraint in financing the oil patch.\u201cThe biggest problem our industry faces today is you guys,\u201d       Al Walker,        chief executive of             Anadarko Petroleum Corp.      , told investors at a conference last month. \u201cWe really need the investment community to show discipline.\u201dU.S. oil production is expected to keep growing through year end as producers benefit from investment dollars and hedges on the price of oil that guarantee many companies higher prices until 2018. But if oil prices continue to hover around $45, U.S. producers will find it difficult to sustain the production growth of the last two years, Mr. Kibsgaard said.\u201cI think U.S. E&Ps operating beyond cash flow will be challenged if oil prices stay where they are,\u201d he said. \u201cProduction might not decline, but growth will slow.\u201dSchlumberger\u2019s North America revenue jumped roughly 27% to $2.2 billion in the latest quarter.

Perhaps they could start with reforms to U.S. labor law.The 1935 National Labor Relations Act hasn\u2019t undergone substantive revisions in 70 years, while the U.S. Constitution has been amended six times. Congress has traditionally deferred to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to interpret labor law, but       Barack Obama\u2019s       appointees demonstrated the need to safeguard worker rights in statute as they rigged the rules to favor unions.House Republicans have now introduced an Employee Rights Act partly modeled on state reforms. In the last Congress 137 House Members and 33 Senators co-sponsored similar legislation, which never moved because Mr. Obama had the veto pen. Now they have an ally in the White House.The House bill would require unions to obtain permission from workers to spend their dues on purposes other than collective bargaining. Current labor law lets unions deduct money from worker paychecks to fund political activities. Workers then must go through the tortuous process of requesting a refund for the share not spent on collective bargaining, which unions may broadly define to include member engagement that boosts voter turnout. No other political outfit enjoys this fundraising fillip.Democrats oppose an opt-in requirement because they know many workers won\u2019t voluntarily endorse a portion of their paychecks to fund political spending with which they disagree. Exit polls last year showed that 43% of union households voted for Republicans while Democrats received 86% of labor financial support. An opt-in rule could improve political accountability within unions.Another problem is that only 7% of currently unionized employees voted for their union, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics and NLRB data. Many workforces have turned over completely since their unions were certified. Yet decertifying a union is an arduous process made more difficult by the Obama NLRB.The House bill would mandate a recertification election upon the expiration of a collective-bargaining agreement if a workforce has turned over by more than 50%. In 2011 Wisconsin passed legislation requiring annual recertification elections for public unions. Membership has since dropped by half as many workers have decided that the costs of belonging exceed the benefits.Unions sometimes coerce workers into signing cards and then bully employers\u2014for instance, by threatening a public assault on their brand\u2014into recognizing the card checks in lieu of holding secret-ballot elections. The bill would protect workers and employers from union intimidation by taking card-check off the menu of options. It would also allow employees to withhold their personal contact information from unions.Republicans might not be able to get the 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster, but they could break up the legislation into bite-sized pieces that could be attached to spending bills. Most provisions poll well and can be easily explained to voters. Let\u2019s see who in Congress will vote to protect workers from coercion.Appeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-gops-labor-project-1500678214", "keywords": ["National Labor Relations Board,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,labor disputes,workers pay,political,general news,general labor issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,editorials"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 19:01:00", "news_title": "U.K. Imposes Rules on Hobby Drones       ", "content": "LONDON\u2014The U.K. will require operators of many hobby drones to register them with the government and take a test to assure proper use amid growing global concern the increasingly popular unmanned planes pose a threat to aviation.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and European authorities have registered an increasing number of incidents in which drones have come worryingly close to airliners. In several cases airports have had to temporarily halt operations after drones were detected that could have endangered flights.The British government said it was taking action after research showed drones weighing as little as 400 grams (0.9 pound) could damage the windscreens of helicopters. It would take models weighing about 2 kg (4.4 pounds) or more to damage the windscreens of airliners when those are flying at high speed, the government said in a new report, downplaying concern such a turn of events is likely during takeoff or landing, when most drone encounters occur.Still, the British Air Line Pilots Association said action was needed. \u201cThis report clearly shows that readily available drones, which can be flown by anyone, can shatter or go straight through an aircraft windshield or shatter a helicopter rotor,\u201d the lobby group said in a statement, adding \u201cthose impacts would have catastrophic consequences.\u201dBritish Transport Minister Martin Callanan on Saturday that said drones weighing over 250 grams (0.551 pounds) will be covered by the registration requirement.\u00a0 Operators will also have to show in a test they understand U.K. safety, security and privacy regulations.The FAA tried to force operators of small drones to register them but a federal court earlier this year struck down the regulation it said violated law. The government of Dubai has been trying to crack down on drone flights after disruptions at its busy airport because of illegal use of such devices. British authorities have recorded more than 40 possible incidents of drones coming to close to planes this year alone.Mr. Callanan said the U.K. is trying to balance the commercial potential of using drones with the safety demands. \u201cOur measures prioritize protecting the public while maximizing the full potential of drones,\u201d he said.Some of the smallest and cheapest toy drones wouldn\u2019t be affected. Many of the camera-carrying models that can be purchased relatively cheaply online or at local electronics stores would be affected by the new rules.To help keep drones away from sensitive sites such as airports or nuclear installations, the British government also is strengthening so called geo-fencing requirements. Those require drone makers to design the devices so they can\u2019t fly in prohibit airspace using the air vehicle\u2019s GPS positioning system.Britain\u2019s airport lobby group said the government should move rapidly to require geo-fencing technology.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. Creates Drone Registry.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-imposes-rules-on-hobby-drones-1500678060", "keywords": ["drone regulations,drone safety,hobby drones,private drone ownership,u.k. drone regulations,industrial goods,drones"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 18:56:00", "news_title": "Republican Health Stumbles Upset Party Base ", "content": "The GOP drive to remake the U.S. health-care system, which fueled the party\u2019s rise to power in the past eight years, is becoming a political liability for Republicans, whose inability so far to pass a sweeping health bill in the Senate has angered many conservatives and could weigh on the party in next year\u2019s elections, interviews with voters and political leaders in three states show.While Senate GOP leaders are preparing a long-shot rescue effort next week, the collapse of legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would mark a failure to deliver on a longstanding promise to ditch the Obama-era law, due to differences among lawmakers about what a replacement plan should look like.\u201cWe\u2019re already five years too late,\u201d said Don Tatro, executive director of the Builders Association of Northern Nevada. \u201cI am disappointed it\u2019s gone this long.\u2019\u2019At the same time, some senators have been wary of backing a bill that would sharply curb Medicaid spending and boost the ranks of the uninsured. The pressure is especially intense for the party\u2019s two most vulnerable Senate incumbents up for re-election in 2018, Dean Heller of Nevada and       Jeff Flake       of Arizona, who have been targets of President       Donald Trump       for crossing him on health care and other issues.For senators in safer seats, such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the political consequences are less immediate. Mr. Cruz is considered likely to win re-election, but even he is worried about blowback from Republicans angry that the party has not accomplished more with the broad power in Congress and the White House that voters have given it.Republicans hold a 52-48 margin in the Senate and a more comfortable margin in the House.\u201cThe hard-fought gains of the last eight years have come to naught because a handful of Republican senators don\u2019t see that they\u2019re part of a team,\u201d said Paul Simpson, chairman of Texas\u2019 Harris County GOP, who said there is growing concern that GOP discontent would depress turnout during the 2018 midterms.\u201cThis is a classic case of the perfect destroying the good,\u201d Mr. Simpson said.Mr. Cruz, in an interview, said he believed he was in a strong position in Texas, but he warned that the consequences of failure to deliver on the party\u2019s signature health-care promise could be \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d\u201cWe could lose control of both houses of Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be severe electoral consequences.\u201dStrategists from both parties believe that health care will be a far more important issue in the 2018 midterm elections than the controversy over allegations that Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign had improper ties to Russia. In a Bloomberg News survey this month, 35% of Americans listed health care as the top issue facing the country, ahead of \u00a0jobs, Russia or any other topic.The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Moscow has denied any meddling, and Mr. Trump has called the investigations into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dThe Republicans most at risk of backlash from the GOP base may have some political\u00a0breathing room: Those who have most openly broken from the party to derail Senate action\u2014including Sens.       Susan Collins       of Maine,       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska and       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia\u2014are not up for re-election until 2020 or 2022.For senators facing voters next year, another political danger looms: They risk provoking the vengeance of Mr. Trump, who has demanded that the Senate try one more time next week to revive legislation to overhaul the ACA. \u201cAny senator who votes against starting debate is really telling America that you\u2019re fine with Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Trump said this week at a White House meeting with Senate Republicans.Mr. Heller, of Nevada, is the only Republican running in a state that Mr. Trump lost in 2016, suggesting he may be vulnerable next year. Mr. Heller was a critic of an early version of the Senate repeal-and-replace bill that stalled last week, but has been mum about next week\u2019s expected vote on the GOP effort to repeal the ACA.Back home, Mr. Heller is in a political pickle. On the one hand, his criticism of the Senate health bill has angered some Republicans and independents who voted for him.\u201cHere\u2019s another one of those guys who goes to Washington and discovers governing is hard,\u201d said Fred Weinberg, 65 years old, of Washoe Valley, Nev., who owns radio stations in the conservative rural parts of the state.But from other quarters, there is home-state pressure to keep parts of the ACA, because it allowed Nevada to expand Medicaid, which would be rolled back under the Senate bill. That\u2019s a big reason the state\u2019s popular GOP governor, Brian Sandoval, has criticized the Senate health-care bill.Democrats have promised to use the issue against Mr. Heller.Meanwhile, Mr. Flake is considered potentially vulnerable, because Mr. Trump won Arizona by only four points in 2016. Mr. Flake has been at odds with the president on many occasions, opposing elements of his immigration policy and criticizing his behavior during the campaign. That could make Mr. Flake vulnerable to a conservative or Trump-backed primary challenge.\u201cI feel that he definitely needs to follow President Trump\u2019s lead,\u2019\u2019 said Marcus Huey, 63, who works in the real estate industry in Phoenix and is active in Republican Party politics. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t\u2026it will harm his chance in both the primary and the general.\u201dBut as with Nevada, Arizona is also enjoying the benefits of the ACA, because the state\u2019s Republican governor and state Legislature passed a significant expansion of Medicaid in 2013.Mr. Flake said in an interview said that he is pulled in two directions, wanting both to provide relief to people facing high premiums but also to keep support for the many Arizonans now covered by Medicaid.\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying we\u2019re going to give some relief,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitically, it doesn\u2019t help any of us if we can\u2019t get it done.\u201dDemocrats haven\u2019t yet found a top-tier candidate to run against Mr. Flake, but are making their views known. \u201cIf we just repeal the Affordable Care Act, we will go back to the profit-driven insurance companies, making it impossible for people to be insured,\u201d said Kelly Strachan, 56, a Tucson Democrat and college Spanish instructor.Having made his name as an unyielding conservative, Mr. Cruz has played a different role in the Senate lately, trying to craft a compromise version of the bill that can break the deadlock in the Senate. His supporters say that could help broaden his appeal to voters who have believed he was too ideologically rigid.Mr. Cruz is taking nothing for granted. \u201cThere\u2019s a real frustration that voters are feeling as to why Republicans can\u2019t come together and get the job done,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cI believe we can.\u201d\u2014Alejandro Lazo  and Dan Frosch  contributed to this article.Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com and Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'GOP Health Stumbles Upset Party Base.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-health-stumbles-upset-party-base-1500677779", "keywords": ["affordable care act,dean heller,health bill,health reform,jeff flake,medicaid,republicans,senate,ted cruz,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 18:54:00", "news_title": "Joseph Rago\u2019s Wit and Wisdom", "content": "Editor\u2019s note: Wall Street Journal editorial board member      Joseph Rago       died this week at age 34.

Just read their lips: The president-elect\u2019s chief political aide,       David Axelrod,        wears a sad, drooping number. A neatly trimmed hedgerow stretches across prime facial real estate on       Eric Holder,        the soon-to-be attorney general.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.In the U.S., political facial hair began with       Abraham Lincoln\u2019s       beard. The club ultimately counted nine Presidents, 10 if you count       Richard Nixon\u2019s       five o\u2019clock shadow. Only three chief executives had mustaches without a companion beard, though       Chester A. Arthur\u2019s       connectastache presents a unique case.       William Howard Taft       gets the palm for possessing the last White House mustache, which left office in 1913.Hair today, gone tomorrow: Given time, fashion always spins back around, and Mr. Obama could give that wheel a push. The president-elect has not been subtle in his allusions to Lincoln, and he could just go ahead and make the comparison explicit by growing a beard.The ObamaCare CrossroadsEditorial, March 20, 2010Democrats are on the cusp of a profound and historic mistake, comparable in our view to the Smoot-Hawley tariff and FDR\u2019s National Industrial Recovery Act. Everyone is preoccupied now with the politics, but ultimately at stake on Sunday is the kind of country America will be.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.In our world of infinite wants but finite resources, there are only two ways to allocate any good or service: either through prices and the choices of millions of individuals, or through central government planning and political discretion. This choice is inexorable. Stripped of its romantic illusions, ObamaCare is really about who commands the country\u2019s medical resources.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.A self-governing democracy can of course decide that it wants to become this kind of super-welfare state. But if the year-long debate over ObamaCare has proven anything, it is that Americans want no such thing.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The ugliness of the bill, and of its passage, means that some or all of it might be repealable, but far better not to make the tragic mistake in the first place.PolitiFictionEditorial, Dec. 23, 2010PolitiFact is run by the St. Petersburg Times and has marketed itself to other news organizations on the pretense of impartiality. Like other \u201cfact checking\u201d enterprises, its animating conceit is that opinions are what ideologues have, when in reality PolitiFact\u2019s curators also have political views and values that influence their judgments about facts and who is right in any debate.In this case, they even claim that the government takeover slogan \u201cplayed an important role in shaping public opinion about the health-care plan and was a significant factor in the Democrats\u2019 shellacking in the November elections.\u201d In other words, voters turned so strongly against Democrats because Republicans \u201clied,\u201d and not because of, oh, anything the Democrats did while they were running Congress. Is that a \u201cfact\u201d or a political judgment? Just asking.As long as the press corps is nominating \u201clies of the year,\u201d ours goes to the formal legislative title of ObamaCare, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. For a bill that in reality will raise health costs and reduce patient choice, the name recalls       Mary McCarthy\u2019s       famous line about every word being a lie, including \u201cthe\u201d and \u201cand.\u201dProfessor CornponeEditorial, Jan. 31, 2011The last time these columns were lambasted by a presidential candidate in Iowa, he was Democrat       Richard Gephardt       and the year was 1988.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0Imagine our amusement to find Republican       Newt Gingrich       joining such company.The former Speaker blew through Des Moines last Tuesday for the Renewable Fuels Association summit, and his keynote speech to the ethanol lobby was as pious a tribute to the fuel made from corn and tax dollars as we\u2019ve ever heard. Mr. Gingrich explained that \u201cthe big-city attacks\u201d on ethanol subsidies are really attempts to deny prosperity to rural America, adding that \u201cObviously big urban newspapers want to kill it because it\u2019s working, and you wonder, \u2018What are their values?\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Gingrich traced the roots of these supposed antipathies to the 1880s, an observation that he repeatedly tendered \u201cas an historian.\u201d The Ph.D. and star pupil of futurist       Alvin Toffler       then singled out the Journal\u2019s long-held anti-ethanol views as \u201cjust plain flat intellectually wrong.\u201dMr. Gingrich is right that ethanol poses an intellectual problem, but it has nothing to do with a culture war between Des Moines and New York City. The real fight is between the House Republicans now trying to rationalize the federal fisc and the kind of corporate welfare that President Obama advanced in his State of the Union.Obama\u2019s Running MateEditorial, May 12, 2011Like Mr. Obama\u2019s reform, RomneyCare was predicated on the illusion that insurance would be less expensive if everyone were covered. Even if this theory were plausible, it is not true in Massachusetts today. So as costs continue to climb, Mr. Romney\u2019s Democratic successor now wants to create a central board of political appointees to decide how much doctors and hospitals should be paid for thousands of services.The Romney camp blames all this on a failure of execution, not of design. But by this cause-and-effect standard, Mr. Romney could push someone out of an airplane and blame the ground for killing him. Once government takes on the direct or implicit liability of paying for health care for everyone, the only way to afford it is through raw political control of all medical decisions.Race Against the CureEditorial, June 29, 2011More broadly, the Avastin fight is about the FDA and its desire to more tightly control the development of cancer drugs. Avastin was initially approved under the FDA\u2019s \u201caccelerated approval\u201d process that is supposed to speed treatments for terminal illnesses and unmet medical needs. Dr. Pazdur, the New England Journal of Medicine and the rest of the medical-political establishment have decided that accelerated approval\u2019s flexibility is too friendly to commercial drug developers, and in Avastin they\u2019ve found a pretext to gut it.The FDA\u2019s anti-Avastin campaign is enforcing a culture of research and development that will discourage the innovation, investment and risk-taking that will be necessary to produce the next generation of cancer treatments. More imminently, thousands of women may die more quickly and live with more pain because government regulators substitute their own opinions about clinical meaningfulness for those of oncologists and their patients.Hillary\u2019s Financial FootingEditorial, April 15, 2014In the Arab world throwing a shoe is considered an insult, and       George W. Bush       famously had one hurled at him during a Baghdad press conference in 2008. Less explicable was the pump thrown at       Hillary Clinton       last week during a speech at a Las Vegas casino.\u201cIs that somebody throwing something at me? Is that part of Cirque du Soleil?\u201d Mrs. Clinton quipped after dodging the projectile. \u201cMy goodness, I didn\u2019t know that solid waste management was so controversial.\u201dMrs. Clinton ought to pay a visit to New Jersey, but\u2014hold on: solid waste management? Yes, Mrs. Clinton was speaking at the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries convention. According to the trade group\u2019s             Twitter                   account, she told the crowd that \u201c#recycling can stimulate the economy/ offering real value/ helping economic recovery.\u201dThis insight cost the recyclers north of $200,000 or $250,000\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. We don\u2019t begrudge anyone making a buck, though it is amusing to see the Clintons getting rich off the same 1% that President Obama\u2019s Democratic Party blames for most of mankind\u2019s ills, at least in election years. As for the latest in flying footwear, the National Shoe Retailers Association has its annual conference in Florida this November. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton\u2019s agent should put in a request for the keynote.The Political John RobertsEditorial, June 26, 2015For the second time in three years, Chief Justice John Roberts has rewritten the Affordable Care Act in order to save it. Beyond its implications for health care, the Court\u2019s 6-3 ruling in King v. Burwell is a landmark that betrays the Chief\u2019s vow to be \u201can umpire,\u201d not a legislator in robes. He stands revealed as a most political Justice.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.Justice Scalia quips acidly that \u201cwe should start calling this law SCOTUScare,\u201d but the better term is RobertsCare. By volunteering as       Nancy Pelosi\u2019s       copy editor, he is making her infamous line about passing the law to find out what\u2019s in it even more true than she knew at the time.The Presidency as the Art of the DealOp-ed, Nov. 21, 2015In a word, we got the full       Donald J. Trump       experience, albeit unmediated by television cameras and featuring the principal on his best behavior. He didn\u2019t call anyone a moron or a pathetic loser, at least anyone present in the room. Mr. Trump\u2019s entourage included his adult daughter Ivanka, and they were as likely to invoke their trophy properties and the logistics of pouring concrete as they were trade, immigration and the economic nationalism that has carried him to the apex of the GOP field.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.As Mr. Trump is on his way out, he says he\u2019ll stay in the race beyond Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, even if he gets napalmed by super PACs (a       John Kasich       outfit started to unload this week) and notches losses in those states. \u201cThat could happen and, again, I\u2019m self-funding my own campaign, you know, but you\u2019re right, I could get that. And we\u2019ll give it back to them, but we\u2019ll see what happens. You never know, you never know, it\u2019s politics and you never know what\u2019s going to happen. But we\u2019re in there pitching and hopefully we do a good job.\u201dIt\u2019s politics, not business, but you never know. Maybe it\u2019s time to start imagining Mr. Trump, come January 2017, in possession of the nuclear launch codes.The Donald and The BarackEditorial, March 12, 2016As Mr. Obama tells it, all of this reflexive Obama bashing created \u201can environment where somebody like a Donald Trump can thrive. He\u2019s just doing more of what has been done for the last seven and a half years.\u201d In other words, Republicans didn\u2019t clean up the standing water in their own backyard and now they\u2019re complaining about mosquitoes.One irony is that even as Mr. Obama denied any liability for Mr. Trump, he lapsed into the same rhetorical habit that helped fuel the businessman\u2019s ascent. For Mr. Obama, principled opposition to his policies is always illegitimate or motivated by bad faith.Like the President\u2019s nonstop moral lectures about \u201cour values\u201d and \u201cwho we are as Americans,\u201d by which he means liberal values and who we are as Democrats, he reads his critics out of politics. No wonder so many Americans feel disenfranchised and powerless.A Trade Lesson in Trump ScarvesEditorial, April 9, 2016We\u2019ll admit to smiling this week when a Consumer Product Safety Commission press release crossed our desk, warning that Ivanka Trump-branded lines of scarves are being recalled for violating federal flammability standards. The 100%-rayon products, which the agency says pose a \u201csevere burn risk,\u201d were made in China.Thankfully no one has been injured by these combustible accessories, though a question is whether Donald Trump and his family partners will ever be burned by voters for the disjunction between his political rhetoric and business practices. The same day as the recall, the candidate assailed Ford\u2019s $1.6 billion investment in a Mexican auto plant as \u201can absolute disgrace.\u201dBig-League Brother Is Watching, Say Orwell\u2019s Unlikely New FansOp-ed, Feb. 2, 2017If Americans who buy \u201c1984\u201d actually read and think about it, maybe the irony will be that U.S. political fevers start to break. Any literate person can recognize that the analogies between Mr. Trump and Big Brother are, not to put too fine a point on it, preposterous.The terror of \u201c1984\u201d is that the state has achieved total control of society, oppression so absolute as to obliterate the independent mind. \u201cIt is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless it may be,\u201d the torturer O\u2019Brien tells       Winston Smith       in Room 101.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.Were Big Brother watching today, he might begin by liquidating the tens of thousands of people committing the thoughtcrime of acquiring \u201c1984.\u201d Instead, many of those purchases are delivered by government-employed mailmen.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201cIf you want a picture of the future,\u201d O\u2019Brien says, \u201cimagine a boot stamping on a human face\u2014for ever.\u201d At worst, the Trump correlative is an overlong infomercial for steaks and herbal supplements.The ObamaCare RepublicansEditorial, July 19, 2017All of these Senators campaigned for nearly a decade on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. Now they finally have a President willing to sign literally any bill that lands on his desk, but in the clutch they choked.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.If the ObamaCare Republicans now get primary opponents, they have earned them. In two weeks nobody will recall this or that grievance about the Senate bill, but GOP voters will wonder about the bill of goods they were sold.The damage to the GOP\u2019s political image will radiate in ways that are hard to predict. If Republicans can\u2019t be trusted to fulfill a core commitment to voters\u2014whether repeal and replace, or simply to reduce the burden of government\u2014then what is the point of electing Republicans? \u201cSorry, it was too hard\u201d isn\u2019t a winning 2018 message, and botching health reform will add to the betrayal narrative that has so inflamed conservative politics. In this case the critics will have a point.Appeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/joseph-ragos-wit-and-wisdom-1500677693", "keywords": ["joe rago,joseph rago,pulitzer prize,the wall street journal,wsj,wsj editorial writer,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions,editorials"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 18:53:00", "news_title": "Tech Giants: See How the Mighty Have Fallen", "content": "Jonathan Taplin laments the fact that digital technology has \u201cnever been voted on by anyone\u201d (\u201cCan the Tech Giants Be Stopped?,\u201d Review, July 15).

In fact, the surest way to stifle innovation is to subject it to majority rule. For instance, most universities are slow to innovate in part because even small changes in curriculum or policy must go through layers of approvals and votes by faculty and administrators, many of whom have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.

An old professorial type came up to me. \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d he asked. \u201cTrollope,\u201d I said, \u201che\u2019s the greatest.\u201d Here the man admonished me. \u201c      George Eliot       is the greatest,\u201d he said, and walked off.I had just been given the Received Word, and one could be certain, for the fellow had a beard. Though affronted, I gave it some thought. And I concluded that he, though entitled to his opinion, had not only placed his ex cathedra chip on the wrong square, but also on my shoulder. Sheesh.I\u2019ve read       Anthony Trollope\u2019s       entire work several times, not because I am schooled, educated or right-thinking\u2014I don\u2019t believe I am more afflicted in these than most\u2014but because I like to read. Trollope\u2019s 47 novels, nonfiction and incidental work are a delight. His prose is clear, perfectly rhythmic, concise and, at turns, trenchant and profoundly funny.His plotting is stunning. How does one write a three-decker novel, which will appear in installments over a year and a half, and have the equation resolve magnificently\u2014although making it up as one goes along? Compound this, if you will, with his work habits: Trollope rose every morning at 5:30 and wrote 2,500 words. If he completed one novel before meeting his daily goal, he began another. All while running various departments of the British General Post Office.As for the old professor\u2019s avatar, I revere George Eliot. She wrote a book, \u201c      Daniel Deronda,       \u201d that largely disposed the British public to the plight of my folks, the diaspora Jews. There\u2019s a street named after her in Jerusalem. That\u2019s fame indeed. But \u201cDaniel Deronda\u201d contains the faults of all her novels. It runs beautifully along apace until two-thirds through or so, and then she decides it needs a plot. Moreover, the portrait of the Jews is ill-written and absurd.I have tried to reread \u201cDaniel Deronda,\u201d \u201c      Felix Holt      \u201d and \u201cMiddlemarch,\u201d but find them, on second pass, uninteresting. Even \u201cScenes of Clerical Life,\u201d which has no plot and no faults, does not lure me back again. I can revere but not delight in Eliot\u2019s works.Charles Dickens,        on the other hand, makes me throw up. Whence and whyfore his place in English letters? He was a penny-a-liner, not that there\u2019s anything at all wrong in that. I write for money, too. But consider his contemporaries       Wilkie Collins       (1824-89) and       Mary Elizabeth Braddon       (1835-1915), inventors of the detective novel.Their books were potboilers and page turners. Their penny-dreadful work still reads like the day\u2019s first ice-cold martini (or, if English, warm stout). One ends most chapters exclaiming, \u201cOh, no!\u201d rather than muttering, as with Dickens, \u201cMmm\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. now that\u2019s quaint.\u201dDickens\u2019s characters are cardboard cutouts, even in their names: Inspector Bucket, the Brothers Cheeryble,       Jerry Cruncher.       They are mechanicals. His prose is turgid and, less forgivable, tortured. Here\u2019s his rendition, in \u201cDombey and Son,\u201d of a sea-captain\u2019s dialect: \u201cIt\u2019s an almighty element. There\u2019s wonders in the deep, my pretty. Think on it when the winds is roaring and the waves is rowling.\u201dWhat a load of bosh. The public devotion to Dickens\u2019s work is sententious and perhaps even self-congratulatory\u2014like that affection of New York theatergoers between the wars for the lugubrious plays of       Eugene O\u2019Neill.I find Dickens\u2019s gloomy view of London stinking of the lamp: that sputtering meager lamp which hardly brightens the overpowering darkness of the cold garret room, where, huddled in the corner, poverty has moored a guiltless ragamuffin, who, et cetera.Compare the sobriety of       Thomas De Quincey\u2019s       contemporary \u201cConfessions of an English Opium Eater\u201d: \u201cIt cannot be denied that the outside air of London society is harsh, cruel and repulsive.\u201d Or the hopefulness of       Samuel Butler\u2019s       late-Victorian novel \u201cThe Way of All Flesh\u201d: \u201cYoung people have a marvelous faculty of either dying or adapting themselves to circumstances. Even if they are unhappy\u2014very unhappy\u2014it is astonishing how easily they can be prevented from finding it out, or at any rate from attributing it to any other cause than their sinfulness.\u201dDoes anyone read literature anymore? If not, I embrace them as my brethren in that they do not read Dickens. But here is the outlier: In addition to the potboilers, he wrote a masterpiece. It is \u201cA Tale of Two Cities.\u201d This book is not only magnificent but sui generis. Here Dickens writes in a voice no one has heard before, from him or anyone else. And one must, of course, hand him \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d as a gimme and an assist on \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201dTo the rest, good riddance, I say. I loathed       Henry James       and counted myself boorish until I read the opinion of his best friend,       Edith Wharton,        who pronounced him unreadable. As per Marley\u2019s Ghost, we each wear the chains we forged in life; if fortunate, the various spirits come to induce us to shed them. I\u2019m not chutzpadik enough to think I rank among those shades, but if I have relieved one reader of the burden of a factitious and oppressive affection for Chuck Dickens I will rest evermore content.Mr. Mamet is a playwright and screenwriter.Appeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/charles-dickens-makes-me-want-to-throw-up-1500677262", "keywords": ["dickens,eliot,english literature,literature,trollope,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 18:44:00", "news_title": "California Says Tesla Is Too Big to Fail", "content": "Even as Wall Street bulls tout Tesla\u2019s stock, almost a conspiracy of silence has surrounded the most interesting questions. One of these concerns what happens when 300,000 customers who deposited $1,000 each for the forthcoming Tesla Model 3 learn that the $7,500 federal tax credit will expire before they can get their hands on it.Now we know. Tesla may not be too big to fail as far as the federal government is concerned, but it certainly is too big to fail as far as California politicians are concerned.As enthusiast site GreenCarReports.com says frankly of AB 1184, a bill recently passed by the state Assembly and awaiting Senate action: \u201cCA bill would make up for federal electric-car incentives as they expire.\u201dYep, the law clearly is designed to help an electric-vehicle manufacturer about to exhaust the federal credit, a category that includes only Tesla. (The credit starts phasing out with the 200,000th car sold.) The bill specifies a car that gets at least 200 miles per charge\u2014as the new Tesla Model 3, at 215 miles, just does.The proposed law is suspiciously friendly toward a luxury brand going up against Mercedes and             BMW.       It aims to bridge the price gap between an electric vehicle and a comparable gasoline-powered car. For a high-end car, the rebate could be $10,000, $20,000 or even $30,000. In a state that accounts for half of all electric-vehicle sales, this vig would be determined by politically appointed air-quality regulators.Of all the emails that make me chuckle, the best are those from Tesla owners who say taxpayer rebates don\u2019t matter. They\u2019d buy the car anyway. Apparently they think Tesla founder       Elon Musk       is leaving money on the table in dealings with them. If his customers would buy without the $7,500 federal rebate, he\u2019d be a fool not to raise the price by $7,500 and capture the value of the tax credit for Tesla.He\u2019s no fool. All state-sponsored benefits, including HOV privileges, end up in Tesla prices. They go straight to Mr. Musk\u2019s bottom line.A company like Tesla could only happen in California\u2014or maybe       Vladimir Putin\u2019s       Russia.Let\u2019s see, then-Rep.       Henry Waxman       and state Treasurer       Bill Lockyer       strong-armed             Toyota                   into providing Tesla its giant local factory on the cheap. Hardly a year passes without Mr. Lockyer or his successor signing off on fresh tax favors. These include $174 million in sales-tax suspensions for Tesla\u2019s equipment purchases via a state agency pretending to be the purchaser.Tesla has banked tens of millions from California\u2019s existing green-car rebates, and hundreds of millions in state zero-emissions credits. When Nevada outbid California for a battery plant in 2014, the Sacramento Bee instructed the faithful: \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Expect local Democrats to dig deep when Mr. Musk goes shopping for his promised truck plant later this year.In desperation, EV promoters point out that these sums don\u2019t come close to the $550 billion in annual subsidies the oil industry allegedly receives. This figure, which comes from the International Energy Agency, mostly consists of the implicit value of cheap oil products that countries like Iran and Venezuela dump on their domestic citizens.Yes, these subsidies are abominable, but they are at the expense of the oil industry. They are also at the expense of energy users in the rest of the world. The price of gasoline to the rest of us would be lower, making electric cars less attractive, if these handouts were stopped.AB 1184 must still pass the California Senate. It still needs funding through the state cap-and-trade program, thereby shifting its cost to other energy users. Gov.       Jerry Brown       still needs to sign the bill\u2014Mr. Brown who recently decided his swan song will be a global climate conference in San Francisco in September 2018, where he can be expected to tout California\u2019s green-car leadership. Perhaps not accidentally, the bill would take effect the same month, landing just as Tesla might be facing its Waterloo over the federal credit\u2019s disappearance for Model 3 customers.But here\u2019s where we must eat a little crow. Seven years ago, we cautioned against the idea that Mr. Musk\u2019s California \u201cpolitical allies-of-the-moment represent some kind of commitment to the company\u2019s long-term success.\u201dWe were obviously wrong. California Democrats have so lashed themselves to Tesla, there\u2019s no amount of taxpayer money they won\u2019t spend to keep it afloat.No, the company isn\u2019t a bankruptcy risk as long as investors keep supplying fresh capital to let it make and sell cars at a loss. But Tesla has always been, in large measure, a public-policy bet. The shares have been on a shaky ride lately amid Mr. Musk\u2019s Model 3 Hail Mary.

Raymond Thomas,        head of U.S. Special Operations Command, called the CIA decision a tough one that may have been related more to the program\u2019s lack of successes than to Washington\u2019s relations with Moscow.\u201cFrom what I know about the program and the decision to end it, [it was] absolutely not a sop to the Russians,\u201d Gen. Thomas said at the Aspen Security Forum.The widely criticized CIA effort failed to gather any significant momentum and was largely sidelined in recent months as the       Trump       administration began looking for ways to cooperate more closely with Russia, according to people familiar with the program.Moscow has long opposed the CIA efforts in Syria, where Russia provides Mr. Assad with critical military support, fueling criticism of the decision to end of the U.S. program..Sen.       John McCain (R-Ariz.)       criticized the CIA decision as a victory of Russian President       Vladimir Putin.\u201cThe administration is playing right into the hands of Vladimir Putin,\u201d Mr. McCain said earlier this week. \u201cMaking any concession to Russia, absent a broader strategy for Syria, is irresponsible and shortsighted.\u201dFormer CIA Director       John Brennan       called it \u201ca mistake\u201d to suspend the program and said it runs counter to U.S. efforts to keep rebel forces from joining extremist groups.\u201cThey\u2019re going to gravitate more towards the terrorist-extremists efforts\u201d in the absence of U.S. aid and assistance, Mr. Brennan said at the security forum.The CIA declined to comment and the White House National Security Council didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.The CIA launched the program in 2013 as a way to push Mr. Assad from power. But the Obama administration took a cautious approach. Syrian fighters working with the CIA complained that they never got enough firepower to be effective. The Obama administration long opposed providing the fighters with advanced weapons because of fears that the rebels might defect or that the weapons could be seized by anti-American forces.The CIA trained thousands of Syrian fighters for the program, which ran in parallel with U.S. efforts to fight Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Gen. Thomas oversees hundreds of U.S. Special Operations Forces members working alongside other fighters in Syria as they try to rout Islamic State from its remaining strongholds.Mouaz Moustafa, head of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a Washington-based advocacy group, characterized the CIA decision as a concession to Russia.\u201cThe administration has allowed Russia to lead the way in Syria,\u201d he said.While the CIA winds up the covert program, the Trump administration is stepping up its cooperation with Russia in Syria.Earlier this month, Russia and the U.S. reached agreement on a limited cease-fire in southern Syria, and the two countries are looking for ways to expand the effort to other parts of the country.\u2014Peter Nicholas in Washington contributed to this article.Write to Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com and Shane Harris at shane.harris@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/end-of-cia-program-to-equip-syrian-rebels-not-a-sop-to-russia-general-says-1500676993", "keywords": ["putin syria,russian wish list,trump gives putin what he wants,trump russia,trump syria,Central Intelligence Agency,White House National Security Council,U.S. Special Operations Command,John Brennan,John McCain (R-Ariz.),Raymond Thomas,Trump,Vladimir Putin,political,general news,national,public security,espionage"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 18:43:00", "news_title": "How Jerusalem\u2019s Top Cop Keeps the Peace", "content": "JerusalemThree Arab Israelis opened fire last Friday on Jerusalem\u2019s Temple Mount, a holy site for Jews, Muslims and Christians alike. Two Israeli policemen were killed, as were the attackers. For the first time in decades, Israel closed the compound on a Friday, Islam\u2019s holy day. By Sunday it had reopened, with security cameras in place and temporary metal detectors to screen worshipers.As this article went to press, Palestinian protests against the new security policies were escalating, with three reported dead. But this violence and the terrorism that sparked it are both notable for their rarity. In a region beset by war and political turmoil, Israel and its capital in particular have remained relatively calm. That\u2019s thanks in part to radical changes in counterterrorism policing led by Maj. Gen.       Yoram Halevy,        54, commander of the Israeli Police\u2019s Jerusalem district.One of the force\u2019s most experienced officers, Gen. Halevy has for the past 17 months overseen the police\u2019s counterterrorism mission in Jerusalem, including roughly 5,000 officers of the Israeli Police and the Border Police. A Jerusalem-born son of Iraqi Jews, he speaks fluent Arabic and has worked undercover in Arab communities. In an interview only days before the Temple Mount attack, he discussed some of his reforms publicly for the first time and explained why he thinks they are reducing both violence and civilian tolerance of it.\u201cAnyone can chase down and arrest terrorists. That\u2019s the easy part,\u201d he tells me through a translator, though he speaks some English. \u201cDenying terrorists the civilian support they crave and need to operate is a far tougher challenge.\u201d The most effective way of mitigating Palestinian hatred, he adds, is to \u201cempower the silent civilian majority, which is sick and tired of the violence, but afraid to say so.\u201d That, he says, is his overarching goal.The numbers are impressive. In 2015 there were 43 terrorist attacks in Jerusalem; the Temple Mount shooting was only the ninth so far this year. Two years ago there were 33 stabbings in the city and six deaths due to deliberate car-rammings; this year those counts stand at six and one, respectively. The number of stone-throwing incidents has dropped 15% this past year alone. Government figures that include the neighboring West Bank are equally encouraging. The year ending last September averaged 38 major attacks a month in what Israel calls Judea and Samaria. That\u2019s down this year to 10 a month, a 73% drop.Gen. Halevy meets me in his office, which adjoins the Western Wall, a symbol of the eternal Jewish presence in this disputed city. Tapping the plaster wall near his desk, he observes that Judaism\u2019s most sacred stones lie just beneath. His window looks down on the pilgrims from around the world who come to pray and tuck notes into gaps between the thick slabs of ancient limestone. On the other side of the historic divide are the tens of thousands of Muslims who pray at the Temple Mount each Friday\u2014numbers that swell to as many as 240,000 during the month of Ramadan.\u201cThere are extremists on both sides of this wall,\u201d Gen. Halevy says, referring not only to Islamist terrorist groups like Hamas but also Jewish zealots like the one that killed former Prime Minister       Yitzhak Rabin.       \u201cBut the law applies to all equally.\u201dHe has worked to instill that ethos in his overwhelmingly Jewish force. In the past when Palestinians attacked Israelis, he says, officers considered the suspects \u201cenemies,\u201d even after they had been cleared of wrongdoing. Questioning by police often meant gratuitous humiliation for men whose culture prizes honor: \u201cFathers were interrogated and berated in front of sons; sons in front of fathers.\u201dThrough police retraining, Gen. Halevy has worked to end what he calls the \u201csystem of humiliation.\u201d Now officers are taught how to minimize personal dishonor during questioning. Suspects who are cleared receive an explanation of why they had fallen under suspicion\u2014and, if appropriate, an apology. Then, in what Gen. Halevy describes as \u201cphase two\u201d of an interrogation, the police ask: \u201cHow can I help you?\u2019\u00a0\u201dOfficers under Gen. Halevy\u2019s command make a point of getting to know the community. In the past, too many Jerusalemites, especially Palestinians, never encountered the police until after a protest, stone-throwing or other attack. Those encounters tended to produce hostility, even though Palestinian merchants, government workers and civilians have the most to lose when violence triggers closures.Now, he says, thanks in part to the changes in policing, \u201cpeople are increasingly speaking out against the violence and signaling a lack of support for such attacks.\u201d Last month after       Hadas Malka,        a 23-year-old sergeant major in the Border Police, was fatally stabbed near Damascus Gate before the final week of Ramadan, Jerusalem remained calm. Military and police special forces were deployed to prevent further attacks, but \u201cthere were no riots or protests in the city,\u201d Gen. Halevy recalls. \u201cNor were there celebrations or glorification of the three Palestinians who killed her and were then killed themselves. It was the quietest Ramadan in Jerusalem on record.\u201dGen. Halevy has opened a police unit within a new community center that serves Palestinians by issuing permits, identity cards and driver\u2019s licenses and provides fire, ambulance and other essential services. Two or three more are expected to open in the coming year. The first \u201ccombined civilian service center\u201d is in the Shuafat refugee camp, on the border between Jerusalem and the West Bank\u2014traditionally a difficult area for Israeli law enforcement. Many Palestinians who never would approach a police station are willing to seek help at these community centers, Gen. Halevy says: \u201cLast week a woman was hysterical because her son had not come home.\u201d Officers drove her around the neighborhood for hours until they found him.The police also tried to ease the security burden on Palestinians who came from the West Bank to Jerusalem for prayer during Ramadan. Before Gen. Halevy took command, those who lacked blue Israeli identity cards endured grueling checks at the city limits. At the request of the Israel Defense Forces, during this Ramadan the police, working with the Palestinian Authority, began conducting security checks in Ramallah and Bethlehem, then transporting Palestinians to Jerusalem by bus. \u201cThey go straight to the Temple Mount,\u201d Gen. Halevy says, \u201carriving without agitation, frustration or the humiliation sometimes inflicted at the outskirts of the city.\u201d He adds that no one who entered the city on a prayer bus has perpetrated a terror attack.If Jerusalem\u2019s Palestinian residents are now treated with greater respect, they also know that their community will pay a heavy price for terrorism or violence: \u201cWhenever stones or firebombs are thrown at Israeli forces, traffic on that street is stopped and shops are closed,\u201d Gen. Halevy says. \u201cMerchants and homeowners near the incident are questioned. People in that neighborhood know they have a lot to lose.\u201d After Sgt. Malka\u2019s murder, Israel canceled all permits for Palestinian family visits in Jerusalem during Ramadan, affecting between 100,000 and 300,000 people. That was in addition to Israel\u2019s usual practice of prohibiting males age 12 to 40 from visiting the Temple Mount during the holy month.Punishment can be particularly severe for a terrorist\u2019s relatives. In addition to sealing or destroying the family home, the police now bring the full force of Israeli law to bear against anyone in the terrorist\u2019s hamula\u2014extended family\u2014who celebrates the murder of Israelis or contemplates attacks to avenge the dead kin. \u201cWe think that collective punishment does not stop terror,\u201d Gen. Halevy says. \u201cBut if, after monitoring family members, we conclude that some relatives are determined to incite more violence or plot revenge, we delay their permits to open a business or insure homes or property. We fine them and their property for minor infractions of rules and take other legal steps to let the community know that inciting or committing violence will be punished.\u201dWhat Israeli police are not permitted to do is confiscate a suspect\u2019s Israeli identity card. \u201cThat would be an effective deterrent,\u201d Gen. Halevy allows, \u201cbut it is not legal.\u201dThe goal of retribution, he says, is \u201cpredictability\u201d: \u201cWe want the community to know that the police will protect them when needed, and punish them when warranted. Consistency leads to public trust in the system.\u201dTo supplement Gen. Halevy\u2019s efforts, the government has installed more surveillance cameras on roads and at sensitive sites in Jerusalem and other cities, according to       Gilad Erdan,        Israel\u2019s minister of public security. To help the police track stolen cars, which terrorists often use in attacks, the government plans to install some 500 cameras that read license plates. And to help detect suspicious activity in public places, the government has installed expensive new facial-recognition cameras\u2014some at Damascus Gate, for instance, where Malka was killed. In addition, the police have doubled their Muslim ranks in the past year, to 4% from 2%. (About 17% of Israelis are Muslim.)Palestinian officials are unimpressed by such changes. Violent incidents may be down, but tension on the ground is rising, says       Elias Zananiri,        a policy adviser and media consultant for the Palestinian Authority. \u201cWe are partners with Israel in combating terrorism, which threatens us all,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut we\u2019re losing ground because there are ultimately no military solutions to terror. .\u00a0.\u00a0. Terrorism and violence are side effects of the disease, which is the absence of hope for a peaceful political solution.\u201dOn Monday, three days after the Temple Mount attack, Palestinian, Jordanian and Muslim religious officials condemned the metal detectors and other security measures as an effort by Israel to change the site\u2019s political status quo and consolidate control. At least three Palestinians were reported killed Friday when protesters hurled bottles and rocks at police in Jerusalem and the West Bank.Gen. Halevy has not backed down. He is focused not on politics, he says, but on fighting terror through effective policing. Counterterrorism will be \u201ca generation\u2019s work,\u201d he says, particularly in the internet age and in Jerusalem: \u201cIn no other city can you cross a national border on foot in 10 minutes.\u201dAs we leave his office, Gen. Halevy silently inspects a group of young police and border-patrol officers donning flak jackets and loading their weapons in preparation for patrol duty. The responsibility, the commander sighs, is a heavy one. To remind the police of that duty, a Hebrew banner hangs in their assembly hall: \u201cGenerations have dreamed of coming to Jerusalem.

Mr. Mattis said he and Mr. Trump have met multiple times on the matter, but didn\u2019t say if he has yet presented a fully formed plan to the White House.North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies have pledged to send more troops, he said, though he declined to elaborate on how many the U.S. might ask them to contribute.Mr. Trump has authorized military officials to send additional troops to Afghanistan, but Mr. Mattis said he hasn\u2019t yet used the authority because of the continuing review process. He also said the president hasn\u2019t ceded broader authority over military decisions in Afghanistan, shooting down the idea that military generals are in charge.\u201cHe delegated not one bit of strategy, by the way,\u201d Mr. Mattis said of the president. \u201cThat is his and his alone.\u201dMr. Mattis also said that he doesn\u2019t believe Islamic State extremist group leader       Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi       has been killed in fighting in Iraq or Syria, despite recent suggestions by Russian officials that the militant leader might have died.\u201cI think he\u2019s alive,\u201d Mr. Mattis said. \u201cUntil I see his body, I\u2019m going to assume he\u2019s alive.\u201dMr. Mattis, asked about the president\u2019s unscheduled dinnertime conversation last week with Mr. Putin during the Group of 20 leading nations summit in Germany, played down the potential for adverse consequences.\u201cI\u2019ve been to hundreds of these dinners, ladies and gentlemen, and you just walk around talking to people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be bored sitting there just eating your p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras.\u201dAs for himself, he joked that an observer would likely find him \u201ctalking to some ne\u2019er do wells\u2014that is just the way I do business,\u201c he said. \u201dYou talk to people who agree, but mostly you talk to people who disagree with you.\u201dWrite to Ben Kesling at benjamin.kesling@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jim-mattis-says-u-s-afghan-strategy-is-nearing-completion-1500676758", "keywords": ["afghanistan,afghanistan strategic review,jim mattis,pentagon,u.s. military,u.s. troop levels,Jim Mattis,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,armed forces,terrorism"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 18:39:00", "news_title": "Courts Rule E-Cigarettes Should Be Regulated Like Tobacco Products ", "content": "A federal court on Friday\u00a0upheld\u00a0government regulations that subject e-cigarettes to the same marketing restrictions as tobacco cigarettes.The Food and Drug Administration assumed regulatory authority over e-cigarettes in 2016, deeming them \u201ctobacco products,\u201d under a 2009 federal law that curbed tobacco marketing.By placing them in the tobacco category, the FDA prohibited the sale of e-cigarettes to anyone under age 18, and required package warning labels and government review of products before they go to market.U.S. District Judge       Amy Berman Jackson       in Washington, D.C., said Friday that \u201cit was reasonable for the agency to conclude that vaping should no longer be completely unregulated, given the marked increase in use, the absence of any regulation of the products and manufacturers in the market, and the potential for public harm.\u201dThe federal government won another regulatory victory earlier in the day, when a federal appeals court upheld a Transportation Department rule banning the use of e-cigarettes on commercial flights.A federal appeals court in 2010 recognized the FDA\u2019s authority to regulate some e-cigarettes, but Friday\u2019s rulings broadly approved of the government\u2019s efforts to equate e-cigarettes with conventional cigarettes.Florida-based e-cigarette manufacturer Nicopure Labs LLC challenged the rule as an overreach of the FDA\u2019s authority in May 2016. The company\u2019s lawyers argued that e-cigarettes with refillable cartridges fall outside the definition of \u201ctobacco product\u201d under the 2009 law, and that it was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d for the agency to require e-cigarette manufactures to undergo premarket review.A similar challenge by coalitions of e-cigarette retailers and users, including Right to be Smoke-Free Coalition and the American Vaping Association, was consolidated with the Nicopure case in Judge Jackson\u2019s court.While many e-cigarettes contain no tobacco, the FDA interprets \u201ctobacco product\u201d to cover electronic nicotine delivery systems\u201cThe agency\u2019s interpretation is entirely consistent with the plain meaning of the statute,\u201d Judge Jackson wrote.A lawyer for Nicopure didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.       Azim Chowdhury,        a lawyer for the Right to be Smoke-Free Coalition, said that his clients were reviewing the ruling and \u201cconsidering our options to appeal.\u201dAn FDA spokesman said the agency doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation.In a nod to some of the rhetoric surrounding the regulations, Judge Jackson also emphasized that her ruling wasn\u2019t about the science of e-cigarettes or their continued existence.\u201cThe court wishes to reassure the many worried vapers who followed these proceedings closely that this case is not about banning the manufacture or sale of the devices,\u201d she said, using a byname for people who inhale the vapor produced by e-cigarettes when they heat nicotine-spiked liquid.Separately, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the U.S. Department of Transportation had acted within its authority when it banned on the use of e-cigarettes on commercial flights last year.In a 2-1 ruling, the court agreed with the agency that a federal law prohibiting airline passengers from smoking tobacco products also covers vaping.The agency said the regulation was driven by a concern that e-cigarettes release vapor plumes containing chemicals that could be potentially harmful or cause discomfort to other passengers.The Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think-tank, filed a lawsuit last year challenging the vaping ban as an \u201cabuse of authority,\u201d saying Congress never intended for the airplane smoking law to cover e-cigarettes.The court said it isn\u2019t clear if Congress meant to restrict only conventional smoking and that the Transportation Department\u2019s broader interpretation was reasonable.\u201cEven if e-cigarettes do not produce smoke, the verb \u2018smoking\u2019 can refer to processes where no smoke is produced,\u201d wrote Circuit Judge       Arthur Randolph       in the opinion.Write to Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.com and Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ban-on-e-cigarettes-on-commercial-flights-upheld-by-u-s-appeals-court-1500658788", "keywords": ["anti-smoking,ecigarettes,ecigarettes on planes,smokeless tobacco,smoking,vaping,vaping on planes,Food and Drug Administration,Transportation Department,marketing,markets,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,transportation department,computers,consumer electronics,personal electronics,electronic cigarettes,handheld electronic devices,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 18:23:00", "news_title": "U.S. Navy Ship to Blame for Deadly Collision, Preliminary Probe Finds", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A preliminary investigation found that the Navy was likely at fault for last month\u2019s deadly collision off the coast of Japan that killed seven American sailors aboard the USS Fitzgerald, a U.S. defense official said Friday.While an investigation is continuing, initial findings suggest that crew members aboard the Fitzgerald failed to take steps to avoid a Philippine-flagged cargo ship, which crashed into the right side of the Navy destroyer on June 17 in one of Japan\u2019s busiest shipping lanes, the official said.The ACX Crystal, a 730-foot cargo ship, slammed into the 500-foot-long destroyer in the dark of night, flooding the sleeping quarters for dozens of sailors and crushing the captain\u2019s cabin.The Fitzgerald\u2019s captain was injured and airlifted to a hospital in Japan as the crew struggled to contain the damage and prevent the destroyer from sinking. Seven sailors were killed in the flooded compartments.The Pentagon immediately launched an investigation into what officials called one of the worst U.S. Navy crashes in recent history. The preliminary findings, first reported by CNN, indicated that the crew aboard the Fitzgerald likely was at fault, according to a defense official who declined to discuss the details.Rear Adm. Dawn Cutler, chief of information for the U.S. Navy, said the investigation was in the early stages and that \u201cit is premature to speculate on causation or any other issues.\u201dAs the investigation unfolded, some former military and commercial shipping captains suggested that the Fitzgerald might have been at fault for failing to give way to the cargo ship.Write to Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Navy Ship Blamed For Japan Collision.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/preliminary-results-of-probe-find-navy-likely-at-fault-in-deadly-collision-1500659394", "keywords": [" collision, sea collision,ship collision,uss fitzgerald,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,navy,transport accidents,transport"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 18:19:00", "news_title": "Hawaii Adopts Emergency Plan for North Korea Missile Attack ", "content": "Hawaiian officials are adopting the motto of better safe than sorry when it comes to the threat of a nuclear weapons attack.The state is potentially on the front-line to aggression from North Korea.\u00a0 On Friday, officials with the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency rolled out a public awareness campaign aimed at educating people on how to respond to an attack.For some, the campaign may recall the \u201cduck and cover\u201d drills of the 1950s in various locations across the U.S. following the then Soviet Union\u2019s development of a nuclear arsenal. The Hawaii campaign will include public service announcements and steps that can be taken at short notice, including evacuation drills for school students.The threat of retaliation from the U.S. means a nuclear attack by the North Korea regime remains very low. Vern Miyagi, administrator of the state emergency agency, said it is his responsibility to prepare for all potential danger to the public. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the exact capabilities or intentions of the North Korean government, but there is clear evidence that it is trying to develop ballistic missiles that could conceivably one day reach our state,\u201d he said.North Korea could develop a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile by taking a variety of different routes, experts have told The Wall Street Journal. The regime has twice launched a satellite from a three-stage ballistic rocket with sufficient power to reach the West Coast of the U.S. and could form the basis for such a missile.The North Korean state has also test-launched a missile with an estimated range of 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers known as the Musudan missile, though the technology of that weapon has proved difficult for the North Koreans, with the state failing several times before one successful launch last year.

The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of senior regulators including the heads of the Fed and Securities and Exchange Commission, is set to discuss the Volcker review at a meeting next Friday.One member of the council, acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika, said Wednesday that he hopes regulators will soon decide to seek public input on how the rule should be changed.The decision about foreign-owned investment funds is likely to be welcomed by foreign-owned banks, whose U.S. operations are covered by the rule, but not their foreign operations. Those banks have argued that the rules unintentionally affect some of their non-U.S. businesses, specifically certain investment funds. The overseas funds in question have structures that could meet regulators\u2019 definition of an affiliate of a firm\u2019s U.S. bank, which would mean the funds were subject to the Volcker rule.The regulators acknowledged foreign banks\u2019 arguments, but also said they were \u201cmindful of concerns\u201d that a bank could potentially use investment funds to evade the Volcker rule, for instance, by moving risky activity into funds outside the rule\u2019s reach.The regulators, in a statement about the foreign investment funds, said they hope the review will \u201caddress any unintended consequences of the Volcker Rule,\u201d adding, \u201cIt may also be the case that congressional action is necessary to fully address the issue.\u201dThey said that through July 21, 2018, they won\u2019t take action against foreign-owned banks for owning the investment funds, as long as the funds meet certain criteria.Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Regulators Pull Back on Part of \u2018Volcker\u2019.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulators-say-they-wont-enforce-volcker-rule-for-foreign-banks-1500667575", "keywords": ["banks,dod,dodd,foreign,frank,pe industry news,rule,volcker,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,securities regulations,banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 18:15:00", "news_title": "Scientists Tee Up 800-Mile Neutrino Shot", "content": "Scientists at a physics laboratory outside Chicago and a mile beneath the Earth\u2019s surface in a former South Dakota gold mine on Friday celebrated the launch of an improbable physics experiment that will shoot subatomic particles through 800 miles of rock and dirt to study some fundamental cosmic riddles.The more than $1 billion experiment, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy; CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research; and institutions from 30 countries is meant to help researchers better understand neutrinos, the most abundant matter particles in the universe.The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment begins at Fermilab, a Department of Energy national laboratory in Batavia, Ill., which will fire an intense beam of neutrinos at near-light-speed through the Earth\u2019s mantle toward detectors at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, S.D. The trip will last about four milliseconds.Construction began Friday on the neutrino detectors at the Sanford lab, which will be about a mile deep and filled with 70,000 tons of liquid argon. Construction on the Fermilab beamline, which will deliver the neutrinos to South Dakota, is scheduled to begin in 2021. The first neutrino beam will fire in about ten years.\u201cTogether, we will build the largest science megaproject ever attempted on U.S. soil,\u201d said Mike Headley, executive director of the South Dakota Science and Technology Authority, which operates the Sanford lab.The Sanford lab, which opened in the summer of 2012 and costs about $20 million annually to maintain, is the site of the former Homestake Gold Mine, which has been dormant since 2001.More than 1,000 scientists from around the world will observe changes the neutrinos undergo on their journey from Illinois to South Dakota and will analyze the neutrinos\u2019 interactions with the extremely cold liquid in the Sanford detectors. They are trying to figure out what role neutrinos played in the universe\u2019s evolution, and their findings could explain why matter exists.\u201cThis project, along with other exciting physics experiments occurring here at the Sanford lab, can transform the young minds of the next generation,\u201d said South Dakota Gov.

They also made a case for exempting the president from giving testimony in depositions, except as a last resort.The judges in both cases, which are in early phases, could toss out the lawsuits without addressing the constitutional issues.\u00a0Courts often avoid making broad pronouncements if they can dispense with cases on narrower grounds. But if the cases move forward, they could lead to rare rulings that change the scope of legal protections enjoyed by the president.Presidents are generally shielded from lawsuits targeting their official acts, such as signing laws and making policies, but the\u00a0U.S. Supreme Court \u00a0put limits on that immunity when it ruled\u00a0unanimously\u00a0in 1997 that a former Arkansas state employee could sue Mr. Clinton\u00a0for alleged sexual misconduct that occurred before he entered the White House.Mr. Clinton, who denied the allegations, had argued unsuccessfully for presidential immunity in the lower courts, leading to his appeal to Supreme Court.The high court\u2019s ruling in the lawsuit brought by the former state employee, Paula Jones, allowed her lawyers to question Mr. Clinton under oath about\u200b his interactions with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, prompting his false testimony that he never had a sexual relationship with her. That led to a grand-jury investigation and his impeachment on perjury and obstruction of justice charges. He was acquitted by the Senate.\u00a0A\u00a0federal judge dismissed Ms. Jones\u2019s lawsuit in 1998, and Mr. Clinton settled with her for $850,000, without admitting liability, while the case was on appeal.\u201cClinton v. Jones said, for the most part, we should treat presidents just like everybody else\u201d\u00a0in lawsuits that focus on\u00a0conduct outside their official duties, said Douglas Linder, a law professor at University of Missouri-Kansas City.The Kentucky case against Mr. Trump involves three protesters who attended a March 2016 Trump rally and allege the candidate incited his supporters to attack them when he said, \u201cGet \u2019em out of here.\u201dU.S. District Judge       David Hale       in Louisville ruled in March that it was \u201cplausible\u201d that Mr. Trump meant to trigger violence against the protesters, rejecting a motion by his lawyers to dismiss the case.R. Kent Westberry and Michael Carvin, who represent Mr. Trump in the Kentucky lawsuit, asked Judge Hale for a protective order that would prevent attorneys for the protesters from questioning the president under oath.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers\u00a0said in their\u00a0Monday\u00a0filing in the Kentucky case that the Jones lawsuit marked the one time in the nation\u2019s history that a sitting president testified as a defendant in a deposition, and unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Clinton sought no protective order, after the Supreme Court ruled against him, the lawyers wrote.\u201cThis Court should not become the first court ever to order a compulsory presidential deposition over the President\u2019s affirmative protest,\u201d the lawyers wrote.Gregory Belzley, a lawyer for the protesters, said the president deserves more flexibility than other litigants to schedule depositions, given the nature of his job, but \u00a0otherwise should be bound by the same rules as anyone else.\u201cIf Trump\u2019s got time to play golf, he\u2019s got time to give a deposition,\u201d Mr. Belzley said.Eric M. Freedman, a law professor at Hofstra University, said Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers were correct that Mr. Clinton was the first to be deposed as a defendant in a civil suit, but courts have compelled information from past presidents in other contexts.President James Monroe, in 1818, provided written answers to questions in the court-martial of Dr. William P.C. Barton, a surgeon he appointed to the staff of the U.S. naval hospital in Philadelphia. In 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously upheld a subpoena for       Richard Nixon\u2019s       tape recordings of his conversations in the White House as part of the Watergate investigation.In the lawsuit in New York Supreme Court, a onetime contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d accused Mr. Trump of defaming her on the campaign trail after she went public with allegations that he groped and kissed her in 2007 after her stint on the show.When the plaintiff, Summer Zervos, came forward with her allegations in the fall, Mr. Trump called the allegations \u201cmade up nonsense\u201d and accused her of seeking the spotlight at his expense.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers said he is immune from the lawsuit filed by Ms. Zervos in January, three days before he took office, because her lawyers filed it in state court, rather than federal court, where Ms. Jones lodged her case against Mr. Clinton.The U.S. Supreme Court said in its 1997 ruling in the Clinton case that\u00a0\u201cdirect control by a state court over the president \u201ccould create friction with the U.S. Constitution, which designates federal law \u201cthe supreme law of the land.\u201d\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s distinction is critical,\u201d wrote attorney       Marc Kasowitz,        who is representing Mr. Trump in the New York case, in a brief late\u00a0last Friday.Gloria Allred, who represents Ms. Zervos, disputed his interpretation, saying Clinton v. Jones showed that \u201cno man is above the law, including the President of the United States.\u201dJudges have also long recognized that state and federal courts \u201care equally competent to adjudicate disputes,\u201d said\u00a0Jonathan Entin, a law professor emeritus at Case Western Reserve University.Ms. Zervos could refile in federal court if Mr. Trump\u2019s constitutional argument carries the day, Mr. Entin said.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-preps-for-battle-against-lawsuits-1500629403", "keywords": [" bill clinton, civil lawsuit,donald trump, kentucky, paula jones, supreme court, the apprentice,U.S. Supreme Court,Bill Clinton,Donald Trump,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,judicial branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 18:06:00", "news_title": "Amazon, Whole Foods Look to Head Off Lengthy Deal Review", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014            Amazon.com Inc.

WFM 0.14%       are giving U.S. antitrust enforcers more time to complete an early review their planned tie-up, a strategy companies sometimes use in a bid to head off a potentially lengthy government investigation.The government\u2019s initial 30-day clock for reviewing the deal started June 23, a week after Amazon announced its plans to acquire Whole Foods for $13.7 billion including debt. But in a corporate filing Friday, Whole Foods said Amazon would re-file documents next week seeking government approval on the deal, effectively re-starting the clock and removing some of the deadline pressure.Companies sometimes use the tactic in the hopes that antitrust enforcers will get comfortable enough with their transaction during the extended initial review that they will agree to forego a longer probe.Many antitrust observers believe the deal doesn\u2019t raise classic concerns about competition because a combined Amazon and Whole Foods won\u2019t have a dominant share of the grocery market.\u00a0 But advocates for strong antitrust enforcement have called for a close review of the transaction, raising questions about what the deal might mean for Amazon\u2019s considerable muscle online, as well as for the future of the retail grocery industry.Representatives for Amazon and Whole Foods didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.Companies are required to provide advanced notice of their transactions to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, which share antitrust authority, and the two agencies have 30 days after the notice to consider whether a merger or acquisition merits closer scrutiny. If the government does want to take a close look, one of the agencies will make a \u201csecond request\u201d for information from the companies, a move that triggers a more in-depth investigation that can take many months.The FTC, which typically reviews grocery store deals, has taken the reins for reviewing the Amazon-Whole Foods deal, though both the commission and the Justice Department have been interested in the topic of innovation and competition in the online space, where Amazon is a leading player.Officials with Justice Department and FTC declined comment on the matter.Both federal agencies remain short-staffed after the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations.\u00a0 President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t announced nominees for any of the three vacancies at the five-member FTC.\u00a0 The Senate, meanwhile, has not yet confirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim.Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-whole-foods-look-to-head-off-lengthy-deal-review-1500674806", "keywords": ["amazon acquisition,amazon grocery store sector,amazon merger,amazon whole foods deal,federal regulation mergers and acquisition,grocery industry consolidation,mergers and acquisitions,whole foods being purchased by amazon,Amazon.com,AMZN,Whole Foods Market,WFM,plans,strategy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,anti-competition issues,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,retail,wholesale,food retailing,specialty stores,etailing,e-commerce,online service providers,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 17:55:00", "news_title": "New Jersey Raises Smoking Age to 21   ", "content": "New Jersey raised the legal age to purchase tobacco and electronic smoking devices to 21 from 19, putting it among the first states in the nation to do so.Republican Gov.

For the week, the index slid 0.9%.The dollar was hit this week by fresh turmoil in Washington.On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that the investigation into ties between President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia in last year\u2019s election are extending to his businesses.

MGI 1.12%       by Ant Financial Services Group, controlled by Chinese billionaire and             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.        BABA 2.20%       co-founder Jack Ma, some of the people said.The committee, known as CFIUS, didn\u2019t green-light the deal by a recent deadline, the people said. Ant refiled its application, and Mr. Ma has continued a charm campaign that included a meeting Tuesday with 20 U.S. and Chinese executives at the U.S. Department of Commerce.The backers of at least four other Chinese deals have recently refiled or said they would refile applications to the committee after failing to get approval within the roughly two-and-a-half-month review period, according to public disclosures.At least two of them have taken the unusual step of refiling twice to try to address the committee\u2019s concerns\u2014            China Oceanwide Holdings                   Group Co., which last year announced a $2.7 billion takeover of Richmond, Va.-based insurer             Genworth Financial Inc.,       and Chinese-government backed Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, which last year announced a $1.3 billion plan to take over Portland, Ore.-based             Lattice Semiconductor Corp.Though refiled deals can still be approved, delays can be symptomatic of committee concerns, said people familiar with the process. At least one smaller Chinese deal to buy a U.S. Wi-Fi hotspot business collapsed last month after failing three times to get approval.Reviews are stretching on for many deals, including one by Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co. to buy a controlling stake in hedge-fund investing firm SkyBridge Capital from financier       Anthony Scaramucci,        who on Friday was named White House communications director. People involved in the CFIUS process say many of their deals are facing monthslong delays.Deal makers say CFIUS\u2014a multiagency committee led by the U.S. Treasury whose task is to screen foreign investments for national-security concerns\u2014is growing increasingly wary of Chinese companies. A recent buying spree pushed China\u2019s announced overseas investments to a record $221\u00a0billion last year, including $66 billion in the U.S., according to Dealogic.Critics in Congress and some government agencies say Chinese investment poses disproportionate risks to national security because it may be directed and subsidized by the government of China, a chief U.S. rival both economically and militarily.The concerns began growing under the previous administration as investment surged, with then-President       Barack Obama       taking the rare step of blocking a Chinese technology deal on his way out of office, and have only continued to intensify during the current administration.Lawmakers and the Treasury are considering changes to the review process that could further tighten scrutiny on Chinese investment. Chinese deal makers are battling similar concerns from European regulators as well.Rising trade tensions between China and the U.S. also could be contributing to increased hesitation by the committee, lawyers and bankers say. High-level trade talks between the two countries ended Wednesday without any concrete agreements, and President       Donald Trump       has said he would consider leveraging trade to get China\u2019s help reining in North Korea.\u201cA deal that might not otherwise raise much concern could raise serious concern if it\u2019s being done by a Chinese company,\u201d said Peter Alfano, a lawyer at Squire Patton Boggs who maintains a database of publicly disclosed CFIUS activity.The committee is also receiving record numbers of filings while still lacking key personnel, including political appointees, as well as clear direction from Mr. Trump. Career professionals see no reason to risk recommending a Chinese deal that could later prompt the ire of administration officials or members of Congress, say people familiar with the process.A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cThe Treasury is fully engaged in the CFIUS process and provides guidance and discusses the issues with the capable career staff whose job it is to protect national security.\u201dJohn Reynolds, a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, a law firm that handles CFIUS cases, estimates the committee is on track to review more than 250 cases this year, versus around 170 in 2016 and more than 150 in 2015. Chinese deals are expected to comprise about 30% of the committee\u2019s reviews this year versus a typical maximum of around 10% in the past, estimates another person familiar with the process.Reviews take a maximum of 75 days, including an investigative period in which the committee may ask for more information. If companies don\u2019t get approval in that period, they can tweak their deals to address concerns and refile their submissions. Preliminary discussions with the committee are dragging on too, lasting as long as six weeks, said a person familiar with the process.For the Ant and China Oceanwide deals, the committee is concerned about the prospect of giving Chinese companies access to Americans\u2019 personal data, said people familiar with the discussions. In the past, the committee likely would have approved such deals without much disruption, but it has grown more sensitive to personal data issues after a cyberattack on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management that U.S. intelligence said in 2015 they suspected China was behind, these people said. China has denied the accusation.Ant and MoneyGram officials have said MoneyGram would continue storing what little personal data it collects at a secure facility in Minneapolis.Most sensitive are Chinese investments in technology, particularly semiconductors\u2014seen by the U.S. as a potential economic and military threat. In December, Mr. Obama nixed the purchase of German semiconductor-equipment supplier             Aixtron SE                   by a Chinese investment fund, following an investigation by CFIUS, which was looking into the deal because Aixtron has U.S. assets.That doesn\u2019t bode well for Canyon Bridge\u2019s deal for Lattice, even though Lattice has said it doesn\u2019t make military-grade technology.

Iran and the six powers that negotiated the agreement are represented on the so-called Joint Commission.With the Trump administration reviewing its Iran policy and accusing Tehran of destabilizing the region, Iranian officials vented frustration about increased U.S. sanctions, including actions targeting Tehran\u2019s elite military unit and ballistic missile program, according to people at the meeting. The Iranians also complained about criticism of the agreement by President Donald Trump and U.S. efforts to persuade other governments to steer clear of doing business with Iran.However, Iran did not make a formal claim that the nuclear deal had been breached or threaten to pull out of the agreement, according to several diplomats. U.S. officials in Vienna emphasized that while the administration is reviewing its Iran policy, it would meet its commitments in the meantime.Supporters of the deal say it avoided further conflict in the Middle East and allows the international community to raise pressure on Iran over its regional activities without Tehran being in reach of obtaining a nuclear weapon. Opponents question Iran\u2019s commitment to the deal and say it gives Tehran an easy path to nuclear weapons once the key restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities expire in the next 10 to 15 years.A statement signed off by       Helga Schmid,        a top EU official who chairs the Joint Commission, urged Iran to continue to abide by its commitments.The participants \u201calso reviewed the status of the sanctions-lifting during which the chair underlined the need to implement the agreement \u201cin good faith and in all its provisions.\u201d The statement acknowledged \u201cexisting challenges\u201d on sanctions.Under the terms of the agreement, all nuclear-related sanctions were suspended on Tehran but most U.S. sanctions remain in place because they are linked to human rights abuses and support for terrorism. The agreement does not forbid new sanctions on nonnuclear areas.U.S. officials say Iran is undercutting the spirit of the agreement by pursuing ballistic missiles and supporting terrorist groups. Senior Trump administration officials have said a key flaw in the agreement is its failure to address what they call Tehran\u2019s effort to extend its power in the Mideast.The EU, Britain, France and Germany have said they strongly support the agreement and would not reimpose sanctions on Tehran if Washington abandons the accord.Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-urges-u-s-to-stick-to-iran-nuclear-deal-after-trumps-criticism-1500671335", "keywords": ["donald trump, iran nuclear deal, joint commission,European Union,Joint Commission,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,international sanctions,nuclear weapons programs,politics,weapons programs"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 17:07:00", "news_title": "Siemens and Bombardier in Talks to Form Train Joint Ventures ", "content": "Siemens AG        SIEGY 0.01%       and             Bombardier Inc.        BDRBF 1.05%       are in advanced talks to combine their train-making businesses, according to people familiar with the matter, as they face stiffer competition from consolidating rivals in China.Germany\u2019s Siemens, one of the world\u2019s biggest industrial conglomerates, and Canada\u2019s Bombardier, which is also a major plane maker, are discussing possibly creating two joint ventures from their train operations. One unit, controlled by Siemens, would hold the signaling operations of the two companies. The second, which Bombardier would majority own, would oversee the rolling-stock operations. Signaling equipment is used to keep trains clear of each other, and rolling stock centers on train manufacturing.A spokesman for Siemens declined to comment.The joint ventures would have combined annual sales of about \u20ac15 billion ($17.5 billion) based on 2016 results of both firms\u2019 train divisions, according to one person familiar with the discussions.The companies expect to reach a deal in the next couple of weeks, though one person familiar with the negotiations said there are still some key issues that need to be resolved. As in all complex merger negotiations, talks could collapse without an agreement. The discussions were previously reported by Bloomberg.The talks come at a time when the 2015 merger of Chinese train makers             CSR Corp.       and China CNR is forcing rivals to gain scale, which enables them to boost results by cutting costs and winning additional customers. In 2016, Bombardier\u2019s transportation business reported its revenue fell 9% from a year earlier to $7.57 billion. Earnings before interest and taxes, a profit measure, also fell. Siemens\u2019s train business has fared better, as its revenue and profit grew in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. Still, orders fell 23% in the year.Siemens is the leading supplier of train-signaling equipment, accounting for about 25% of the global market, compared with Bombardier\u2019s estimated 10% share, according to a recent report by the National Bank of Canada. The report said overlap between the two companies\u2019 rolling-stock businesses could \u201cpresent some challenges\u201d with competition authorities. The train-manufacturing arms of Bombardier and Siemens are both based in Germany, where the two rank as the country\u2019s largest suppliers, the report said.Bombardier had signaled as far back as 2015 that it was considering a possible joint venture amid consolidation in the sector. At the same time, the company has stressed that it wouldn\u2019t sell the train business outright. Bombardier has long valued the train division as a counterbalance to its aerospace division. Train making tends to perform better during economic downturns, when governments increase spending on rail and other infrastructure projects, while demand for aircraft falters. The converse often holds during times of economic expansion.\u2014Christopher Alessi contributed to this article.Write to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com and Jacquie McNish at Jacquie.McNish@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Train Makers Explore Merger.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/siemens-and-bombardier-in-talks-to-form-train-joint-ventures-1500657663", "keywords": ["bombardier, competition, joint ventures, rolling stock, siemens, signaling operations, train business,Bombardier ,BBD.A.T,BBD.B.T,Siemens,SIE.XE,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,joint ventures,consortia,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,railroad rolling stock,aerospace products,parts,aerospace,defense,industrial goods,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 17:06:00", "news_title": "The Stars Come Out at British Open", "content": "After a brutal Friday in which birdies were as scarce as sunshine, the stage is set at Royal Birkdale for the kind of weekend narrative that has been sorely missing from golf: hunter versus hunted, featuring the game\u2019s top players.Jordan Spieth, a two-time major champion at age 23, battled through afternoon storms to finish at 6 under for the tournament, giving him a two-stroke lead over fellow American Matt Kuchar. U.S. Open champ Brooks Koepka and the boisterous Englishman Ian Poulter are three back.But the most dramatic move belonged to Rory McIlroy. The Northern Irishman, a transcendent player but a disappointment in majors of late, had opened the tournament by reaching five shots over par through the first six holes before finishing strong on Thursday. Then he began Friday with birdies on three of the first six to get to two-under.Though his momentum stalled, he finished with the second-best round of the day, a two-under 68 amid wind gusts topping 30 miles per hour.\u201cA lot of quality out there,\u201d McIlroy said of his day.That hasn\u2019t been the case in majors for McIlroy or the game\u2019s other top stars for most of the post-Tiger era, in which first timers have won seven straight majors.Spieth and others on the Tour say advances in technology and data have made clubs and balls so good, and golfers so much smarter about their games, that it\u2019s nearly impossible for the elite to separate themselves from the pack. That makes a return to the dominance of the sport\u2019s past headliners \u2014the Hogan-Palmer-Nicklaus-Watson-Norman-Faldo-Woods continuum\u2014seem unlikely.\u201cNo one is really standing out and sort of taking it by the scruff of the neck,\u201d said McIlroy, who figured to be doing just that when he won four majors in four years from 2011 to 2014, but none since. \u201cThe margins are so fine.\u201dGlass-half-full types call it parity, an example of the strength of the field. Spieth is in that group.\u201cIt speaks to the state of the game, a lot of tremendous young players right now,\u201d he said earlier this week.Glass-half-empty folks call it a bit of a snooze. And parity seems to be a tough sell to many fans: Television audiences for the first two majors of the year were down 11% for the Masters and 8% for the U.S. Open.Spieth hasn\u2019t been the same on the big stage since coughing up a big lead on the back nine at Augusta in 2016. But Friday he brought some magic and hope for a star to again deliver on a major weekend. He opened with a birdie before giving two shots back ahead of the turn. Then he holed out from the fringe on the 10th with a sand wedge in Old Testament-level rain, and drained a 28-footer on a saturated 11th green.The par-5 15th brought an eagle, thanks to a lucky roll on his second shot from the rough, as his ball scampered past the sand onto the green.\u200bSpieth needed all of it to fend off the 39-year-old Kuchar, who carded a 71 in the morning in search of his first major, and Koepka, the 27-year-old American who had just a single Tour win before coming out of nowhere to take the U.S. Open last month.As so often happens in golf these days, there are also a lot of names few will recognize.Unless, that is, you are devotee of 34-year-old Scot Richie Ramsay, who sits in 5th at minus 2, or 44-year-old Englishman Richard Bland, who was lurking near the top of the leaderboard throughout the afternoon, alongside 20-year-old Texan Austin Connelly, who plays under the Canadian flag because his father was born there.A handful of other names recognizable to the lay sports fan figure to be falling out of the hunt. Bubba Watson is a half-dozen shots back, while Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia are tied for 24th at plus two. Justin Thomas, who looked to be a contender after a 67 on Thursday, carded a nine on the par-4 sixth on his way to an 80 and missed the cut. Phil Mickelson also won\u2019t be playing the weekend.Even the world\u2019s top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, struggled from tee to green, posting a middling 71-72 start. He argued that parity is one of the game\u2019s selling points: On any given weekend the 50th best player in the world can win even the biggest tournament without causing too big a shock, something the elite of another well-heeled individual sport doesn\u2019t have to worry about.\u201cIf you look at tennis, the 50th guy in the world is probably not going to win a major championship,\u201d Johnson said.Many golf fans are hoping that it doesn\u2019t happen at this British Open either.Write to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Stars Shine at Birkdale.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-stars-come-out-at-british-open-1500671218", "keywords": ["political,general news,natural environment,golf,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 16:56:00", "news_title": "Wells Fargo Ordered to Reinstate Whistleblower ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Labor Department on Friday ordered             Wells Fargo        WFC -0.27%       & Co. to reinstate a former employee who was terminated in 2011 after she raised concerns that her subordinates were opening accounts without customer consent.The department also ordered Wells Fargo to pay the former employee $577,000 in back wages, damages and attorney fees.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Los Angeles City Attorney fined the bank $185 million last September for allegedly opening as many as 2.1 million accounts nationwide by using fictitious or unauthorized customer information.The order Friday involved a former branch manager in Pomona, Calif., who was fired after reporting suspicious conduct by at least three private bankers working under her.

Yes, the city had in previous decades tolerated the presence of some European-style abstractionists and surrealists (in L.A. they were called Neo-surrealists, of course). But things didn\u2019t really take off until the tall, bespectacled Hopps\u2014who died in 2005 at the age of 72\u2014and his then-wife, Shirley, rented the merry-go-round on the pier at Santa Monica in 1955. They made a kind of gallery of it, with tarp stretched around the poles, and installed a big, shambling painting show mixing such New York heavyweights as Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still with up-and-coming Californians Richard Diebenkorn and Jay DeFeo.After that it was on to founding the Ferus Gallery on La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles\u2014the venue for Andy Warhol\u2019s famous 1962 show of Campbell\u2019s soup-can paintings\u2014and then becoming the country\u2019s youngest museum director, at the Pasadena Art Museum, where Hopps put on a Marcel Duchamp retrospective in 1963. Hopps was rather quickly fired from the Pasadena job and thereafter lurched, often under the influence of one chemical or another, along a prestigiously bumpy, post-California path as an art executive who was always\u2014as a button handed out by his staff announced\u201420 minutes late. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included posts at the Corcoran Gallery and what is now the Smithsonian Museum of American Art, in Washington, and at the Menil Collection, in Houston.In \u201cThe Dream Colony: A Life in Art,\u201d his lively posthumous memoir, we learn all manner of detail from Hopps\u2019s life: for instance, that his grandfather tried to perfect peanut-butter tacos; that Hopps dated Linus Pauling\u2019s daughter in junior high school; that he had his \u201cAh ha!\u201d art moment seeing a Joseph Cornell exhibition at age 15; and that he was wed (the first time) in L.A. at that giant masterpiece of folk sculpture, the Watts Towers.By Walter HoppsBloomsbury, 310 pages, $30Besides the 1955 \u201cMerry-Go-Round Show\u201d (whose actual title was \u201cAction\u201d and from which absolutely nothing sold), Hopps mounted the first overview of Pop Art (\u201cNew Painting of Common Objects\u201d) in 1962; saved DeFeo\u2019s thousand-pound painting \u201cThe Rose\u201d from destruction in San Francisco and trucked it down to Pasadena; shepherded the difficult Barnett Newman through the 1965 S\u00e3o Paulo Bienal, which Hopps had directed; and, well, did a whole lot of other things, outrageous and honorable and both, with artists, government officials, collectors, lovers and strangers.While a first-person account of a life may have the advantage of unlimited access to the subject of the book, it\u2019s also prone to a few weaknesses. Hopps writes of his taco-besotted grandfather, \u201cHe\u2019d go and fetch a big plate of toast from the kitchen and start tossing it at people at the table,\u201d and later, of the real-estate mogul and collector Edwin Janss, that \u201cwhenever he had people to dinner he\u2019d try to get them to watch Bruce Conner movies.\u201d Repeated toast-tossings and importunings to watch avant-garde art films make more colorful characters of granddad and the land baron than would the more probable single instance of each of these events. More broadly, Hopps often played the role of the middleman between artists and the ultra-rich movers and shakers on whom they depend for a living, so his chronicle gets fairly listy at times, with lots of players shuffling on and off the stage whom the lay reader may not know without a program.That complaint registered, \u201cThe Dream Colony\u201d is nevertheless\u2014for anybody moderately interested in the art scene, the inherent risk of exhibiting edgy contemporary art in the censorious minefield of Washington, D.C., or the ups and downs of being bankrolled by wealthy Texans\u2014a very good read. (The book was written with Deborah Treisman, an editor at the New Yorker, and Anne Doran, an artist and former editor, both of whom knew the author.) Hopps refers to the Abstract Expressionist quartet of Still, Newman, Rothko and Jackson Pollock as \u201cthe four horsemen of the sublime\u201d and adroitly sums up Robert Rauschenberg\u2019s achievement as having \u201cbrought the literal world\u2014literal images of the world\u2014back into advanced art.\u201d His chapter on the underrated West Coast painter Frank Lobdell is spot on: \u201cLobdell never had the figurative literalness of Diebenkorn or [Wayne] Thiebaud, but he often had the tone of a forbidding late Goya.\u201dHopps\u2019s bigger thoughts are likewise illuminating: \u201cUnlike painters, all photographers drive\u2014they\u2019ve got to get to their subjects. The automobile changed the course of photography. . . . Photographers have to know how to wait and where to stand. They don\u2019t, in a synthetic way, invent the imagery; their signature is in where they stand to take the pictures.\u201d He cautions, with the wisdom that comes from having jostled bohemians for years: \u201cNever believe an artist when he says he has destroyed his work.\u201dThe sadness arising in readers like me\u2014a grizzled old pro in the art world\u2014comes from both the fact that Hopps is gone from the scene and the probability that there\u2019s only a very small number of his kind still around: maverick, unpredictable, tardy, talented and degree-less curators and museum directors.

How they reacted to that, or to such dishes as Shrimp Wiggle (shrimp and canned peas in white sauce on toast) and Jellied Bouillon Salad (a summer aspic, perhaps), is not recorded. The food was the worst in the history of the presidency (although Mr. Trump\u2019s avowed preference for Big Macs, Lay\u2019s potato chips, and well-done steak with ketchup might indicate a runner-up in the making).In \u201cWhat She Ate,\u201d food historian Laura Shapiro writes that after Eleanor Roosevelt discovered her husband was having an affair, meals became her instrument of revenge. Her culinary cold war with the wheelchair-bound FDR lasted throughout their marriage, ruthlessly waged in consort with Henrietta Nesbitt, her housekeeper and chief ally. The president\u2019s complaints were attributed to the pressures of office. As Nesbitt explained in her 1948 book, \u201cWhite House Diary,\u201d \u201cWhen he said \u2018The vegetables are watery,\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m sick of liver and beans,\u2019 these were figures of speech.\u201dEleanor Roosevelt is one of six very different women here given culinary profiles by Ms. Shapiro. Their attitudes to food reveal a great deal about their lives. Biographers often pay little attention to such \u201ctrivial details,\u201d as one early editor of Dorothy Wordsworth\u2019s Grasmere journal called the meals and domestic doings she described. He cut them out. Later editors restored them.By Laura ShapiroViking, 307 pages, $27Dorothy\u2019s sad story opens Ms. Shapiro\u2019s fascinating book. The journal records a tranquil life over three years in the Lake District as she looked after her brother, the poet William Wordsworth, making him bread, gooseberry tarts and meat pies. The day he married, in 1802, she passed out cold. Several years later, she fell into a long decline and eventually succumbed to dementia. Dorothy had once been thin and vigorous; now she became so fat it took two people to hold her upright. Only food made her happy. She would scream for butter, but her hunger was never satisfied.Nor, it seems, was the hunger of the Edwardian aristocracy. For Rosa Lewis, a pretty Cockney who rose from scullery maid to become a caterer to the aristocracy and a favorite of Edward VII, food was the key that opened the doors of the most exclusive houses in London. Her clients ate with the voraciousness of passengers on a Carnival cruise ship. Four massive meals a day were the rule, with another, less massive meal around midnight. It was a time, Ms. Shapiro writes, when \u201cwealth, fashion, and ambition were making extraordinary demands not only upon manners but upon food, which was constantly radiating signals that confirmed or dispelled the status of the householder.\u201d But after World War I everything Lewis had relied upon was either unobtainable or pass\u00e9. She ended up being satirized by Evelyn Waugh, who in \u201cVile Bodies\u201d (1930) described her once-renowned game pie as \u201cquite black inside and full of beaks and shot and inexplicable vertebrae.\u201dEnglish cooking was the butt of jokes for most of the 20th century. But as Ms. Shapiro points out, there was often excellent food to be had, and you could find it in the writing of Barbara Pym. \u201cShe didn\u2019t set out to overturn the long-cherished assumptions about the horrors of British food, but character after character, meal after meal, that\u2019s exactly what happens.\u201d Pym published six novels between 1950 and 1961; in one of them, \u201cExcellent Women,\u201d her narrator writes: \u201cI washed a lettuce and dressed it with a little of my hoarded olive oil and some salt. I also had a Camembert cheese, a fresh loaf and a bowl of greengages for dessert. It seemed an idyllic sort of meal that ought to have been eaten in the open air, with a bottle of wine and what is known as \u2018good\u2019 conversation.\u201d Pym\u2019s subtly comic stories of spinsters, vicars and church bazaars, like Rosa Lewis\u2019s boiled bacon and broad beans, one day went out of style. They were rediscovered in 1977 after Philip Larkin and the biographer Lord David Cecil cited her in the Times Literary Supplement as the most underrated writer of the preceding 75 years.Pym clearly loved to eat, but for Helen Gurley Brown, editor of Cosmopolitan and author of the best seller \u201cSex and the Single Girl\u201d (1962), food meant dieting. Brown may have wanted equality for women but she knew that her readers\u2019 final aim was to attract a man, and to do that they had to be thin. \u201cWhen you\u2019re full, you know you\u2019ve been naughty,\u201d she told them. Every night, however, Brown gave herself a treat: a whole package of sugar-free diet Jell-O topped with a dollop of light fruit yogurt. \u201cFifty cals\u2014heaven!\u201d Fifty cals of rubber.Brown spoke with a certain cultural authority when she suggested that the Cosmo reader wear a ruffled frock to a picnic\u2014\u201cas Emma Bovary might have done.\u201d She was on shakier ground when she tried to pass on food tips. In these, Ms. Shapiro writes, \u201cEmma Bovary is serving quick \u2019n\u2019 easy vichyssoise made from frozen potato soup mixed with half-and-half.\u201d       Gloria Steinem       once tried to get Brown to say something serious and revealing about herself. Her response was \u201cI\u2019m skinny!\u201dThe most startling of the six women profiled is Hitler\u2019s mistress, Eva Braun. Ms. Shapiro notes that a \u201cmoral distance\u201d separates her from the others in the book (that\u2019s putting it mildly), and yet her gaze was always directed at the man she loved. While prisoners starved to death in concentration camps, Braun joined the diners at Hitler\u2019s well-laden table at the Berghof, his Bavarian mountain retreat. \u201cWhat emerges most vividly in Eva\u2019s relationship with food,\u201d Ms. Shapiro writes, \u201cis her powerful commitment to fantasy. She was swathed in it, eating and drinking at Hitler\u2019s table in a perpetual enactment of her own daydreams.\u201d She adored the special treats that came her way as the F\u00fchrer\u2019s favorite, but nothing was more important to her than keeping a slender figure. \u201cWhen the mashed potatoes with cheese and linseed oil came around, Eva said a firm no.\u201d Her food was champagne.At the end, the inhabitants of Hitler\u2019s bunker began frantically blocking out reality with magnum after magnum of the stuff. On the day he shot himself, Hitler is said to have eaten a final lunch of spaghetti with tomato sauce.

Among their favorites were promotions for USA Network\u2019s \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cBroad City\u201d and             Amazon.com\u2019s       comic-book adaptation \u201cThe Tick.\u201dFor several years, Hollywood studios and networks have been building elaborate installations, called \u201cactivations\u201d by marketing executives, in hotels, tents and fields around the San Diego Convention Center to hype movies and TV shows. The center is crowded and space is at a premium, forcing companies to venture outside in their ever-escalating quest for fan attention.This year may be something of a tipping point, though, as nearly all the most buzzed-about and popular experiences during Comic-Con aren\u2019t technically part of Comic-Con. Yes, panels where stars and creators answer questions and show new trailers are still part of the official programming. But for fans\u2014who have numbered 167,000 at past Comic-Cons\u2014aiming to feel as if they\u2019re being transported inside their favorite movies and TV shows, the thing to do is walk around downtown San Diego.Mile High Comics, one of the largest comic-book stores in the U.S., opted not to lease space to sell its wares at Comic-Con for the first time in 44 years, in part because there are too many distractions beyond the show floor, company president Chuck Rozanski wrote in a newsletter.\u201cWhen you can see \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019 \u2018Pok\u00e9mon,\u2019 and hundreds of other exhibits across from the convention hall, why bother going into the hall?\u201d Mr. Rozanski wrote.Perhaps the most elaborate installation outside the convention center this year is for Alcon Entertainment\u2019s \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d which comes out in October. Fans waited more than an hour in the heat to try a virtual-reality game tied to the sequel to the 1982 sci-fi cult classic film. After the game ended, they entered a 12,800-square-foot space designed to look like a city street in dystopian Los Angeles, complete with a crashed flying car, neon lights, a bar and 34 actors playing future residents, including police who \u201ctest\u201d whether visitors are humans or \u201creplicant\u201d robots.While some of these events near the convention center were impressive because of their scale, others were popular because they were hard to get into and gave the lucky few a unique experience. \u201cMr. Robot\u201d fans were offered clues to an elaborate puzzle inside replicas of a restaurant and bank from the show. Those patient and skilled enough to solve it ended up in a dark room where they answered questions from a masked actor, received a recorded phone call from the show\u2019s co-star B.D. Wong and got to peek at photos offering hints about the coming third season.A promotion for \u201cWestworld,\u201d HBO\u2019s sci-fi Western show, accommodated only 12 visitors an hour. The visitors, who had to secure advance reservations to the experience located 10 blocks from the convention center, landed a personal interview to help figure out what type of cowboy they would be. Then, fitted out in 10-gallon hats, they entered a recreation of a saloon from the show where actors portraying bartenders and a prostitute talked to them and served cocktails.Photo ops were ubiquitous at these events, whether with swords from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d or hungry zombies from \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d as were pleadings from staffers to share the pictures on social media with promotional hashtags.Several gave visitors RFID wristbands to keep track of what they did and, presumably, gather information for future marketing. Amazon quizzed visitors on their way into and out of the \u201cTick\u201d experience on their knowledge of and feelings about the show and the company\u2019s video-streaming service.Perhaps the people most happy about the array of pop-culture experiences throughout San Diego this week were those who didn\u2019t get a Comic-Con badge, which costs $220 for four days.Tyler Corcoran was waiting in line for the \u201cBank of E,\u201d part of the \u201cMr. Robot\u201d experience, after ending his work day. The programmer said he has never been inside Comic-Con but planned to spend the evening soaking up all the entertainment around it, for which no badge was needed.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-coolest-fan-experiences-at-comic-con-arent-inside-comic-con-1500660728", "keywords": ["political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 16:27:00", "news_title": "The Voice of Kenya", "content": "In 1977, on the orders of Kenya\u2019s then vice president, Daniel arap Moi, Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o was detained without trial in a maximum security prison in Nairobi. His offense was having engaged in \u201cactivities and utterances . . . dangerous to the good Government of Kenya and its institutions,\u201d a likely allusion to two works that had excoriated the newly independent nation\u2019s greed and corruption, the Dostoevskian crime novel \u201cPetals of Blood\u201d and the play \u201cI Will Marry When I Want,\u201d which Mr. Ngugi was performing with a grassroots theater company.The year of confinement did not have the intended effect of silencing him. Writing on government-issued toilet paper, Mr. Ngugi kept a scrupulous diary, later published under the title \u201cDetained,\u201d and produced a novel, \u201cDevil on the Cross\u201d (Penguin, 291 pages, $16). The latter, which first appeared in 1980, has just been reissued in Penguin Classics, joining the small shelf of his novels that have been deservedly canonized by the iconic series.With \u201cDevil on the Cross,\u201d Mr. Ngugi added his name to a motley fellowship of authors ranging from Boethius to Jean Genet who managed to turn out books while behind bars. But the forerunner he may have had mind was the 17th-century English clergyman John Bunyan, who wrote the great Christian allegory \u201cThe Pilgrim\u2019s Progress\u201d while incarcerated for refusing to conform to the Church of England. Mr. Ngugi\u2019s allegorical novel stages a kind of satirical reversal of Bunyan\u2019s pilgrimage to the Celestial City, imagining a journey from Nairobi to the wicked village of Ilmorog, where the Devil is staging a contest in evildoing. Instead of showing mankind the path to heaven, it exposes the latter-day hellscape of a postcolonial Kenya that worships at the altar of money.Its main character is Jacinta Wariinga, a Sister Carrie-like heroine who looks for a job in the booming capital and finds only lecherous executives dangling employment in exchange for sexual favors. While roaming the city, Wariinga receives a mysterious invitation to something called the Devil\u2019s Feast, \u201cA Devil-Sponsored Competition to Choose Seven Experts in Theft and Robbery.\u201d During the trip to Ilmorog to view the nightmarish spectacle she encounters travelers from all strata of Kenyan society\u2014laborers, intellectuals and businessmen\u2014and the novel records their testimonies, concluding with the speeches of the nouveau riche vying in the satanic competition.As might be expected from a writer issuing a cri de coeur from inside a prison cell, there isn\u2019t much nuance to this passionate, polemical book. The commentary on Kenya\u2019s rising materialism is sardonic and acid-tipped. \u201cBelieve me when I say that theft and robbery are the measure of a country\u2019s progress,\u201d says one of the businessmen. \u201cBecause in order for theft and robbery to flourish, there must be things to be stolen.\u201d By studying the ways of the West, a stranger tells Wariinga at the start of her journey, Kenyans \u201chave been taught the principle and system of self-interest and have been told to forget the ancient songs that glorify the notion of collective good.\u201d In the end she is one of the few characters able to forcefully resist the devil\u2019s lures, embracing a vision of salvation that lies in a return to the communalism of the distant pre-colonial era.But the most interesting aspect of the novel is the way it uses and distorts the stories of the Bible, paralleling Mr. Ngugi\u2019s contention that the Gospels brought to Kenya by missionaries had been wholly replaced by a gospel of wealth. One stand-alone chapter facetiously repurposes the Parable of the Talents to defend the virtue of amassing huge fortunes. The victor at the Devil\u2019s Feast is a man who has contrived to extract and export the actual blood of his workers, a practice rationalized on the grounds that drinking blood is part of the Christian rite of the Eucharist.Mr. Ngugi\u2019s familiarity with Christian teaching is as profound as that of any living novelist, and the tension in his fiction comes from the ways he both draws from and rebels against its influence. The son of a peasant farmer, he attended a Protestant boarding school in the 1950s and was during his childhood ardently religious. In his 2012 memoir \u201cIn the House of the Interpreter\u201d\u2014the title alludes to an episode in \u201cThe Pilgrim\u2019s Progress\u201d\u2014he writes about the disjunction of mastering English by studying the King James Bible (\u201c\u2018I learned to mix the simple, the compound, and the complex for different effects\u201d) while his brother fought in the Mau Mau uprising against British rule.His slim, beautiful 1965 novel, \u201cThe River Between\u201d (Penguin, 148 pages, $15)\u2014the first he wrote but the second published, following the prize-winning \u201cWeep Not, Child\u201d (1964)\u2014reflects the ambivalence of his upbringing. Set during the time of the Victorian missionary Dr. Livingstone, it centers on Waiyaki, a gifted, Western-educated village leader who is torn apart as he tries to \u201cbridge the gulf\u201d between Christian converts and those who practice the ancient customs. \u201cWaiyaki knew that not all the ways of the white man were bad. Even his religion was not essentially bad. Some good, some truth shone through it. But the religion, the faith, needed washing, cleaning away all the dirt, leaving only the eternal. And that eternal that was the truth had to be reconciled to the traditions of the people.\u201d Both tribes zealously prophesy a Messiah, one to bring all people to Christ, the other to drive out the white man. Waiyaki\u2019s downfall is that he glimpses a future that harmonizes the ways of both, and thus pleases neither.Kenya\u2019s metamorphosis into a cutthroat kleptocracy drove Mr. Ngugi back toward tradition, even as he was forced into exile in the West. Beginning with \u201cDevil on the Cross,\u201d he began to write his books in his native tongue of Gikuyu, later translating them into English. (He records that he would consult his cellmates on the finer points of the language.) His Gikuyu magnum opus is \u201cWizard of the Crow\u201d (Anchor, 768 pages, $16.95), published in 2006 after nearly a decade in composition. Whereas the contradictions of his background and country had combined in his early novels in the form of tragedies, they now appeared as a gloriously sprawling political farce set in the invented African republic Aburiria.The novel centers on the schemes of Aburiria\u2019s all-powerful dictator to construct a modern-day Tower of Babel, a massive boondoggle sponsored in part by the easily taken international banks. The Ruler\u2019s nemesis is another overburdened savior figure in the vein of Waiyaki and Wariinga, in this case a luckless beggar named Kamiti who pretends to be a witch doctor and soon accumulates a huge following, sowing disorder among the peasantry and government cadres alike. But the comic elements of this antic, fantastical beast of a book can\u2019t disguise the moral project at the backbone of all of Mr. Ngugi\u2019s fiction, salvaging the eternal truths of an old way of life within a modern system that has increasingly little use for them. \u201cDon\u2019t cry despair at those who sold the heritage,\u201d Kamiti counsels. \u201cSmile also with pride at the achievements of those that struggle to rescue our heritage.\u201d For over 50 years Mr. Ngugi has been at the forefront of that struggle.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-voice-of-kenya-1500668848", "keywords": ["bookcar0722,book review,books,political,general news,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,domestic politics,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 16:26:00", "news_title": "The Best New Children\u2019s Books", "content": "It is easy to have fun at the expense of turkeys. They are such funny-looking birds, with their tiny heads and dangling wattles that seem so hilariously at odds with their magnificent bodies and stately way of strutting about.

The turkeys in this picture book are as dumb as rocks. They are so dumb that they forget their own names, though they recollect that each name has \u201ca round thing in the middle,\u201d like a doughnut.For all that, they\u2019re sweet and amiable souls, and in Mr. Cazet\u2019s humorous, mixed-media illustrations, 4- to 8-year-olds will follow them through a day of absurdities, from dawn to sunset. Bob imagines himself to be smarter than his friend, which gives him intellectual swagger. When Tom wonders aloud why the sun comes up in the morning and goes down at night, Bob has an answer. \u201cIn the morning, the sun is full of hot air,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo . . . it rises, like a balloon.

The news of the meeting was first reported by CNN.\u201cAmbassador Rice appreciates the Committee\u2019s efforts to examine Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere, which violated one of the core foundations of American democracy.\u00a0She was pleased to cooperate with the investigation given its extraordinary national significance,\u201d Ms. Pelton said.The probes on Capitol Hill into allegations of Russian interference and questions about whether President       Donald Trump\u2019s       campaign colluded with Moscow are picking up steam. Russia denies meddling in the election, and Mr. Trump has said his campaign had no dealings with Moscow.Next week, several of Mr. Trump\u2019s close associates and family are scheduled to appear on Capitol Hill. His son-in-law       Jared Kushner,        who was a top campaign adviser and an attendee at a meeting with a group of Russians, will speak to investigators in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee.His son       Donald Trump Jr.,        who released emails showing he arranged the June 2016 gathering under the presumption he would obtain damaging information about Democratic contender       Hillary Clinton,        and former campaign chairman       Paul Manafort,        another attendee, will appear before the Judiciary Committee.Ms. Rice\u2019s testimony has also been sought by investigators in the U.S. House of Representatives, where a similar probe is underway. She is expected to appear before the House panel in the coming weeks.Republicans have been eager to question Ms. Rice about her role in the \u201cunmasking\u201d of the names of associates of President Donald Trump in classified intelligence reports during the transition between administrations.Typically, references to\u00a0Americans caught up in foreign surveillance are redacted, but national security officials have the authority to un-redact, or unmask, the names in classified reports distributed within the government.Ms. Rice had the lawful authority to order names unmasked as national security adviser, and she has said she did nothing improper. But Republicans say her decision to unmask the names of Trump associates during a presidential transition period warrants further scrutiny due to the political sensitivities.House Intelligence Committee Chairman       Devin Nunes       revealed publicly in March that the names of Trump advisers were unmasked. It was later revealed that the information he obtained came from the White House. That was one reason he decided to step aside from leadership of his committee\u2019s investigation into Russian activity in last year\u2019s election.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/susan-rice-meets-with-senate-panel-in-russia-probe-1500668643", "keywords": ["2016 election,obama administration,probe,russia, russian interference,senate intelligence committee,senate investigation,Barack Obama,Susan Rice,political,general news,national,public security,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,presidential elections,upper house"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 16:19:00", "news_title": "Mueller and Associates", "content": "President       Donald Trump       has himself to blame for the appointment of Robert Mueller. But that doesn\u2019t mean Mr. Trump or the republic deserves the damage Mr. Mueller seems willing to do to the body politic. Just like former FBI Director       James Comey       and too many other Washington officials, the special counsel\u2019s office appears to be leaking everything except evidence of collusion.If Mr. Mueller somehow manages to demonstrate that the 2016 Trump campaign really did cooperate with Russia to rig the election then of course it will all be worth it. But news of his expanding investigation suggests that Mr. Mueller doesn\u2019t think he can\u2014and has instead focused on simply searching for anything detrimental to Mr. Trump.It\u2019s possible Mr. Mueller is running a tight ship and that various accounts of his expanding investigation are either false or based on sources who are actually not that familiar with his investigation. But let\u2019s assume for the moment that, for example, Bloomberg\u2019s story, \u201cMueller Expands Probe to Trump Business Transactions,\u201d is accurate. The news service reports:Why would a counterintelligence investigation focused on potential foreign influence on last year\u2019s election be examining the details of a 2008 real estate transaction? One reasonable conclusion is that Mr. Mueller\u2019s team has quickly decided that they don\u2019t have a lot of hot leads from 2016. Also, if Mr. Mueller and his associates actually did discover proof that Team Trump colluded with the Russians to rig the 2016 election, would any further evidence be required?Focusing on some of the particulars, it seems that if one wanted a well-known beauty pageant to be staged in the exotic locale of Moscow and to feature one\u2019s Russian pop-star son as it was broadcast on a large American television network, one probably would expect to write a fairly large check.As for the real-estate transaction, there may be important facts that haven\u2019t been made public, but selling to a Russian oligarch didn\u2019t make Mr. Trump unique in his industry. In fact, it might have been more odd if Donald Trump had been an American developer of luxury real estate who did not do business with Russians.A Journal story in 2008 noted that the Trump sale to Mr. Rybolovlev was part of a larger trend:What should happen now? In June, National Review\u2019s incomparable Andrew McCarthy offered some good advice for the Deputy Attorney General:In the absence of any evidence of a crime, no American\u2014not even Donald Trump\u2014deserves to be the subject of an investigation without limit.***Today at the Journal we are mourning the loss of our beloved friend and colleague Joe Rago.

The International Energy Agency said last week that OPEC crude output was rising to its highest level in 2017 at 32.6 million barrels a day, driven by Libya, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia.But any prospect for more OPEC supply increases can shake a market in which a rally was already looking fragile, brokers and analysts said. That rally includes U.S. oil\u2019s longest winning streak in seven years, but has stalled late this week as it bumped up against six-week highs, a signal to some momentum-based traders that oil\u2019s next move is a retreat.OPEC has tried to ease a longstanding glut and boost prices with a pact to cut output this year, but it hasn\u2019t pushed futures to the $60 mark that many expected.

Alexander Pope, however, found him a Renaissance humanist \u201cknowing in the customs, rites, and manners of Antiquity.\u201d When Shakespeare writes of Rome, said Pope, \u201cnot only the Spirit but the Manner of the Romans are exactly drawn.\u201dPaul A. Cantor, a professor of English at the University of Virginia, sides with Pope. In his first book, \u201cShakespeare\u2019s Rome\u201d (1976), he treated the three plays \u201cCoriolanus,\u201d \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d and \u201cAntony and Cleopatra\u201d as a chronicle of Rome from city to empire. Now, in \u201cShakespeare\u2019s Roman Trilogy,\u201d he advances a more ambitious thesis: These plays constitute a thematically unified whole, a trilogy dramatizing, in the terms of his subtitle, \u201cThe Twilight of the Ancient World.\u201d As Roman civic virtue led to empire, Mr. Cantor argues, empire readied the world for Christianity. He shows that Shakespeare systematically stages the virtues, vices and souls of a small martial republic, a decadent empire and a new religion.Each Roman play concerns a focal point in the history of free citizens becoming imperial subjects. Read consecutively, the three form a panoramic study of the life and death of Rome, the ancient city whose heroes conquer all cities until no others remain. In this trilogy, the polis dies by her children.By Paul A. CantorChicago, 302 pages, $90; $30 paper\u201cCoriolanus\u201d shows a young Republic in which classes fight for honor. Plebeians and patricians, their tribunes and senators, are checks and balances on one another. Competition channels ambitions and ensures political participation. Yet overambitious men emerge. Roman heroes conquer for fame and office. For his prowess in battle, the patrician Coriolanus almost wins consulship. But his contempt for plebeians leads to his exile. He vengefully attacks Rome with her enemies and almost succeeds. Already, Rome proves vulnerable to heroes who would become Caesar.\u201cJulius Caesar\u201d shows a dying Republic led by a figure like Coriolanus but who can overcome his patrician side to win over plebeians. Military rule has made the Roman people, once engaged citizens, into cynical auditors of oratory. Unlike Coriolanus, Julius Caesar becomes dictator by feigning humility and bribing the masses. Ultimately, in assassinating Caesar, Brutus and Cassius enact the Republic\u2019s end. They resist Rome\u2019s impulse toward empire, but the empire strikes back.\u201cAntony and Cleopatra\u201d shows the effects of empire: dead cities, new longings. When Rome incorporates Greeks and Egyptians into her body politic, her citizens replace local self-governance with quietist philosophies, Eastern cults and eros. Freed from republican limits, Antony and Cleopatra\u2014Rome and Egypt\u2014enjoy boundless romance. Their desire for love is as limitless as empire, and marked by tyrannical ambition. \u201cHe doth bestride the narrow world / Like a Colossus,\u201d Cassius says of Caesar. In Antony\u2019s time, love is a Colossus over a buried Rome.Here, Mr. Cantor argues, Shakespeare shows how Caesarism aided the rise of Christianity. In his discussion of \u201cAntony and Cleopatra,\u201d Mr. Cantor says that Shakespeare anticipates Nietzsche\u2019s dichotomy of \u201cmaster morality\u201d and \u201cslave morality.\u201d From Homer to Aristotle, master morality prizes valor and cunning, and detests foolishness. But Christianity preaches world-wide what Judaism originated: \u201cThe wolf shall dwell with the lamb.\u201d What Roman nobles deem bad and good, Christians deem good and evil; pride becomes sinful and meekness beautiful. Shakespeare\u2019s characters act masterfully in \u201cCoriolanus\u201d but slavishly in \u201cAntony and Cleopatra.\u201d Yet while Nietzsche leaves open how Christians defeated Roman nobility, Shakespeare provides the mechanism.For Nietzsche, slave morality began in a humiliated aristocracy: During the Babylonian exile, Jewish priests criticized the warrior class and preached truth to power. Humbled under Caesar, aristocrats sought consolation in new philosophies. In \u201cAntony and Cleopatra,\u201d Rome conquers Egypt, but Orientalism woos Rome. This ancient globalization prepares the Mediterranean world for the Gospel, because suffering under Caesar can be seen as redemptive through the lens of Christianity. In this way, the corruptions of empire, of conqueror and conquered, precondition the rise of the nascent religion. As Mr. Cantor concludes, the Roman plays form a tragedy of competing goods in historical transition: Rome is the tragedy of slave morality reinterpreting master morality.Although Mr. Cantor traces many Nietzschean parallels in Shakespeare\u2019s thought, and usefully brings in Machiavelli, his sketch of Shakespeare the philosopher leaves one wanting more. Comparing Shakespeare with pre-Renaissance writers seems called for: Augustine codifies pagan/Christian contrasts; Dante extolls republican virtue in Cato but punishes Brutus and Cassius. Contrasting Augustine\u2019s and Dante\u2019s evaluations of the Roman metamorphosis with those of Shakespeare, Machiavelli and Nietzsche would be in point.In short, one hopes that Mr. Cantor\u2019s book precedes a more comprehensive study of Shakespeare, Rome, politics and philosophy. Shakespeare is indeed a philosophical poet, and nowhere more so, as the present book demonstrates, than in his Roman trilogy.\u2014Mr. Shinkel is a researcher for the Faith and Liberty Discovery Center, opening in Philadelphia in 2019.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/twilight-of-the-ancient-world-1500667804", "keywords": ["bookcar0722,book review,books,political,general news,society,community,arts,entertainment,religion,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 16:06:00", "news_title": "White House to Tackle Manufacturing Gaps It Says Weaken U.S. Security ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The White House said it is conducting a broad review of the strength of the U.S. defense-industrial sector to try to correct weaknesses in advanced technology and industrial policy.The Pentagon has long been worried that the decline in important parts of U.S. manufacturing has weakened U.S. national security.

In \u201cA Mind at Play: How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age,\u201d Jimmy Soni and Rob Goodman make a convincing case for their subtitle while reminding us that Shannon never made this claim himself.Claude Elwood Shannon (1916-2001), born in Petoskey, Mich., during World War I, brought a solid Midwestern sensibility to a world facing even greater upheaval in World War II. The definitive biography of Norbert Wiener is titled \u201cDark Hero of the Information Age.\u201d Alan Turing\u2019s is subtitled \u201cThe Enigma.\u201d John von Neumann served as a model for Dr. Strangelove in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s masterpiece. But there was nothing dark, enigmatic or strange about Claude Shannon. He enjoyed a happy childhood, left a trail of admiring friends and collaborators, served on the front lines of mathematics during World War II, raised a family, made a fortune, and helped launch the revolution to end all revolutions while countering the myth of the tortured genius along the way.The only one of the four Information Age pioneers who was also an electrical engineer, Shannon was practical as well as brilliant. After undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan, he went to MIT to study with Vannevar Bush, the engineer, inventor and visionary who later masterminded the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II. Shannon also joined the university\u2019s flying club, Messrs. Soni and Goodman note, only for the instructor to consider banning him from the cockpit so as not to risk losing this versatile mind \u201cof most unusual promise.\u201d His 1938 master\u2019s thesis enabled the now routine practice of using computers to design better computers by showing how the layout of an electrical circuit could be mapped to an equivalent logical expression; his doctoral thesis two years later focused on the mathematics of genetics.By Jimmy Soni & Rob GoodmanSimon & Schuster, 366 pages, $27In 1940, Shannon moved to Bell Labs, where problems involving information processing were appearing on all wartime fronts. Some of the teams working at Bell and other laboratories reporting to Vannevar Bush studied how to make coded signals as difficult to understand as possible (unless you had the key), while other teams worked to make coded signals as difficult to misunderstand as possible (for \u201cIdentification Friend or Foe,\u201d an electronic system to distinguish friendly targets from hostile ones when both were otherwise just blips on a radar screen). Another group worked on high-speed storage of radar signals (to distinguish targets that moved), while a series of special-purpose computers were developed for problems ranging from the design of nuclear weapons to perhaps the most intractable problem of all: how to aim an antiaircraft shell that would take 20 seconds to reach its target when the target was equally determined to be somewhere else.\u201cThe transmission of a single fixed item of information is of no communicative value,\u201d Norbert Wiener explained in early 1942 in a then-secret wartime report that Shannon credited as an inspiration for his own work. \u201cWe must have a repertory of possible messages, and over this repertory a measure determining the probability of these messages.\u201d Wiener\u2019s insight was that the information content of a message is directly related to its improbability, this being at the heart of the mathematical understanding of languages and codes. Wiener\u2019s theory of information, drawing on his own background in thermodynamics, statistical mechanics and the study of random processes, was cloaked in opaque mathematics that was impenetrable to most working engineers. His treatise \u201cThe Extrapolation, Interpolation, and Smoothing of Stationary Time Series,\u201d known as the \u201cYellow Peril\u201d for the color of its wartime cover, was widely assigned to the technicians trying to solve the problems of World War II. It was rarely understood.Shannon, working on his own secret report, \u201cThe Mathematical Theory of Cryptography,\u201d developed a simpler, more general theory of information, published in two parts as \u201cA Mathematical Theory of Communication\u201d in the Bell System Technical Journal in 1948 and as a small book the following year. He simplified his model as far as possible, idealizing communicated signals as streams of binary alternatives\u2014dots and dashes, or zeroes and ones\u2014that were soon christened, thanks to statistician John Tukey, as bits. \u201cBefore Shannon,\u201d Messrs. Soni and Goodman write, \u201cinformation was a telegram, a photograph, a paragraph, a song. After Shannon, information was entirely abstracted.\u201d He derived explicit formulas for rates of transmission, the capacity of an ideal channel, ability to correct errors and coding efficiency that could be understood by anyone familiar with logarithms to the base 2.Mathematicians use mathematics to understand things. Engineers use mathematics to build things. Engineers love logarithms as a carpenter loves a familiar tool. The electronic engineers who flooded into civilian life in the aftermath of World War II adopted Shannon\u2019s theory as passionately as they had avoided Wiener\u2019s, bringing us the age of digital machines.Messrs. Soni and Goodman cast Vannevar Bush and his prewar differential analyzer\u2014a room-size computer consisting of \u201can enormous wooden frame latticed with spinning rods\u201d\u2014as analog-age dinosaurs caught off guard by the digital computers that spelled their doom. This plays down Bush\u2019s own role as an advocate for next-generation digital machines. \u201cThere is a great deal more arithmetic and better arithmetic in the world than there used to be . . . ,\u201d Bush reported in October 1936; \u201c10,000 tons of [punch] cards are used per year, a total of four billion cards [and] the end of the development is not in sight.\u201d The age of information was already upon us, awaiting Shannon, Bush\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, to make sense of it.Before the war, Turing had disrupted the rarefied world of mathematical logic with his vision of a universal computing machine. After the war, von Neumann, Turing and others decided that it was time to actually build such machines. Shannon\u2019s theorems\u2014equally applicable to conveying strings of bits across distance as coded signals or across time as data stored in memory registers\u2014were essential to getting these machines to work.The digital revolution can be defined, in a technical sense, as a leap from numbers that mean things to numbers that do things. Software was the realization of Turing\u2019s vision that an entire abstract \u201cmachine\u201d could be encoded as a number, perhaps a very long number, and executed as a program by another machine. For everyday communication, reasonably good transmission over a noisy channel was sufficient, since the meaning, whether in English or some other natural language, would survive the trip. For the machine language of computers this was no longer true. Without Shannon, the digital revolution would have ground to a halt.Though he eventually joined the faculty at MIT, Shannon avoided a life sentence in academia by spending his most productive years at Bell Labs in New Jersey and New York. He tackled problems ranging from the supremely practical \u201cA Theorem on Coloring the Lines of a Network\u201d (1949), giving a definite limit on how many colors of wire were needed to install a telephone branch exchange, to the less practical \u201cA Universal Turing Machine With Two Internal States\u201d (1954). In 1953 his passion for computer games, especially chess, led him to remark that \u201cmachines have been built to play games skillfully enough to defeat the people who designed the machines.\u201d An avid juggler, he published a paper on the mathematics of juggling and built an Erector-set robot that could bounce three balls. After investing in a number of successful companies based on his ideas, he became fascinated with trying to identify patterns in the stock market and, judging by his success as an investor, evidently he did.Despite the progress of technology, we still have no clear understanding of how memories are stored in our own brains: Shannon\u2019s principles of redundancy and error correction are no doubt involved in preserving memory, but how does the process work and why does it sometimes fail? Shannon died of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in February 2001. The mind that gave us the collective memory we now so depend on had its own memory taken away.\u2014Mr. Dyson is the author of \u201cTuring\u2019s Cathedral\u201d and \u201cDarwin Among the Machines.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-elegance-of-ones-and-zeroes-1500667513", "keywords": ["bookcar0722,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 16:02:00", "news_title": "Adventures in the Atmosphere", "content": "It was Jan Baptista van Helmont who first recognized that the classical concept of \u201cair\u201d was insufficient to describe the different vapors given off by processes such as burning charcoal or fermentation. Air was not one element but many, and in the early 17th century he coined a new term to describe them: \u201cgas,\u201d from the Greek \u201cchaos,\u201d to reflect their wild, elusive nature. His realization gave birth to modern physics and chemistry, which transformed the world through industrial applications, from steam engines to steel, anesthetics and electric light.Like Sam Kean\u2019s previous books, \u201cCaesar\u2019s Last Breath\u201d is a themed miscellany of scientific stories, told with his trademark combination of goofy wisecracking and an exceptional knack for communicating the principles of science. It takes its title from a famous conundrum: Given that we inhale around 12 sextillion molecules of air each time we fill our lungs, what are the chances that one of them was among those that Julius Caesar exhaled in his dying breath? It turns out that the dizzying numbers involved more or less cancel each other out, and the chances are roughly even.Many of Mr. Kean\u2019s tales are oft told, but he is adept at picking out fresh detail. Most readers will be aware, for example, that Alfred Nobel launched his prize fund to atone for his invention of dynamite, but fewer will know that he was spurred by the newspaper headlines that appeared after his death was announced in error (\u201cThe Merchant of Death Is Dead\u201d) or that he suffered from angina pectoris, for which nitroglycerin turned out to be the remedy. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the irony of fate that I have been prescribed [nitroglycerin], to be taken internally!\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey called it Trinitrin, so as not to scare the chemist and the public.\u201dLike gases themselves, \u201cCaesar\u2019s Last Breath\u201d holds together only loosely, and the reader must, as its author does, embrace the chaos. The book follows a broad trajectory from gases in nature to a history of chemistry to the changing atmosphere of the present and future, but its progress is full of entertaining tangents and \u201cinterludes\u201d that escape the main themes entirely: for instance, on Joseph Pujol, \u201cLe P\u00e9tomane\u201d (whose prodigious ability to pass gas melodically made him a theatrical star in 19th-century Paris), or on the question (vigorously debated by Charles Dickens among others) of whether human bodies can spontaneously combust.By Sam KeanLittle, Brown, 377 pages, $28As a result, Mr. Kean\u2019s narrative of scientific discovery jumps back and forth. The first episode narrated in detail is Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch\u2019s conversion of nitrogen into ammonia, the crucial step in producing artificial fertilizer, which Mr. Kean characterizes as \u201can inflection point in history\u201d that in the 20th century \u201ctransformed the very air into bread.\u201d The process consumes 1% of the global energy supply, producing 175 million tons of ammonia fertilizer a year and generating half the world\u2019s food. Haber and Bosch both won Nobel Prizes but were subsequently tainted by their involvement in developing chlorine gas for the German military.The book\u2019s middle section turns back the clock to steam power, the technology that launched the Industrial Revolution. James Watt was its master craftsman, though Mr. Kean confesses that, as \u201ca sucker for mechanical simplicity,\u201d he regards Watt\u2019s pioneering engine, with its separate condenser, as \u201ca bunch of crap cobbled together.\u201d A more elegant application of gases was Henry Bessemer\u2019s process for making steel, which used blasts of compressed air to make obsolete the laborious and energy-hungry mixing of liquid cast iron and carbon.Other crucial technologies emerged from meticulous investigation of tiny experimental errors. Lord Rayleigh puzzled over a minute discrepancy in gas densities for years before announcing, in 1894, that it was caused by a hitherto unnoticed element he named argon. Argon turned out to be one of a family of non-reactive or \u201cnoble\u201d gases that rewrote the periodic table and illuminated the urban night with glowing neon, krypton and xenon tubes. The quest to liquefy what had been dubbed the \u201cpermanent gases,\u201d such as nitrogen and oxygen, led to a race \u201cto reach the bottom of the thermometer.\u201d Cooling gases were first used in refrigeration by Guinness for their beer around 1895. Albert Einstein, together with Leo Szilard (who later pioneered the electron microscope and particle accelerator), spent years developing methane-powered refrigerators before losing out to the more economical chlorofluorocarbon-based design in the 1930s.With the discovery of radioactivity, atmospheric air and human chemistry became permanently mingled, though Mr. Kean notes that the amount of radioactive material we inhale each year from atomic-weapons testing amounts to no more than a 10th of an X-ray\u2019s worth (to which we add natural traces from sources such as coffee, Brazil nuts and bananas). Experiments in cloud seeding such as 1967\u2019s Project Popeye, in which American planes dropped 47,409 cannisters of silver iodide on Vietnam and Laos with negligible results, have also added our distinctive imprimatur to the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Such gaseous signatures, Mr. Kean suggests, may be our best route to establishing whether distant planets host life. And were we to visit them, we would most probably add to the mix a molecule or two of Caesar\u2019s dying breath.\u2014Mr. Jay is the author, most recently, of \u201cThis Way Madness Lies: The Asylum and Beyond.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/adventures-in-the-atmosphere-1500667364", "keywords": ["bookcar0722,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 15:58:00", "news_title": "Former CBO Directors Defend Agency Against Republican Attacks ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The former directors of the Congressional Budget Office on Friday defended the agency\u2019s work against criticism from Republicans and the White House who have questioned its accuracy in analyzing GOP health-care overhaul legislation.The nonpartisan congressional agency, which provides estimates on the impact of legislation, has come under fire by GOP leaders questioning its projections about their proposals to repeal most of the Affordable Care Act. The White House has released a video attempting to discredit the agency\u2019s accuracy in analyzing the current health law, saying that \u201cThe Congressional Budget Office\u2019s math doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d\u201cWe write to express our strong objections to recent attacks on the integrity and professionalism of the agency and on the agency\u2019s role in the legislative process,\u201d according to a July 21 letter to Senate and House leadership signed by all former CBO directors.Spokespeople for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.) didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.

The feuding over the CBO shows how the partisan warfare of health care has engulfed what is supposed to be a central and independent function of the legislative branch.The Trump administration and Republicans have ratcheted up their criticism after some moderate Senate Republicans said they couldn\u2019t support a health bill that the CBO estimated would leave 22 million more people without coverage. The administration had its own analysis done on the Senate health bill that Democrats called misleading.Mr. McConnell is pushing for a vote as early as next week on a motion that would allow debate on two GOP health-care options: Repealing most of the ACA now with a two-year delay, or repealing most of the law and replacing it with a new GOP plan.GOP Sens.       Susan Collins       of Maine,       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia and       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska all said earlier this week that they would oppose a procedural motion. Mr. McConnell can\u2019t lose more than two GOP votes at any point in the process, given the Senate\u2019s makeup of 52 Republicans and 48 Democratic and allied senators.The CBO on Wednesday released a report estimating that up to 32 million people would be without health coverage in 2026 under a bill that largely repeals the ACA. The agency on Thursday estimated that the number of people without coverage would rise by 22 million in a decade under the Senate GOP plan to repeal and replace large parts of the health law.Republicans are challenging the CBO in order to discredit results that show repealing most of the ACA would cause millions of people to be without health coverage, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank, and a CBO director from 2003-2005.\u201cIt\u2019s over the line,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cThe administration is trying to do it as part of its strategy to pass health bill.

The Obama administration also delayed a requirement that employers provide insurance and enabled people to sign up for coverage in some cases outside of the open enrollment period.The current CBO director, Keith Hall, a former staff economist under President       George W. Bush,        was chosen by GOP congressional leaders in February 2015.In health care, the CBO projects how the legislation would affect premiums, coverage, the federal deficit and market stability.

In a news conference following the meeting, ECB President       Mario Draghi       said he didn\u2019t see convincing signs of inflation picking up.The yield on the 10-year German bond closed Friday at 0.504%, according to Tradeweb, having settled at 0.538% Thursday.Mr. Draghi on Thursday was \u201ca little more dovish than what market participants were looking for,\u201d said       Mary Ann Hurley,        vice president of fixed-income trading at D.A. Davidson.Also Thursday, the Bank of Japan kept its bond-buying program steady but pushed back the date when it expects 2% inflation.Bond buying from the ECB and the BOJ has played a large role in pushing down government-bond yields in the developed world to historically low levels.Analysts have warned that the value of government bonds could fall when these central banks reduce purchases.Write to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasurys-extend-recent-gains-1500647098", "keywords": ["credit markets,ecb,inflation,interest rates,treasurys,u.s. bonds,economic performance,indicators,prices,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 15:41:00", "news_title": "Venezuela Opposition Names Judges, Government Allies Cry Treason", "content": "CARACAS, Venezuela\u2014The opposition-held congress swore in 13 new supreme court judges\u00a0Friday as replacements for pro-government justices, in a bid to undermine the government\u2019s plan to have a special assembly draft a new constitution.Moments after the appointments, the top judge in the constitutional chamber,       Juan Jos\u00e9 Mendoza,        accused those the congress named of treason and asked police to take \u201ccoercive action.\u201d He declined to provide details.\u201cJustice will take care of any usurpers,\u201d       Diosdado Cabello,        a close ally of President       Nicol\u00e1s Maduro       and vice president of the ruling socialist party, said Friday in the western city of M\u00e9rida during a speech to rally support for the constituent assembly.The court\u2019s constitutional chamber earlier said any such a move by the opposition would constitute a crime and a usurpation of its powers. The court, which has a total of 32 justices, has been unerringly allied with Mr. Maduro.The move by Mr. Maduro\u2019s adversaries was the latest in a series of recent actions to challenge the government and rally international support. They said they had the two-thirds majority in congress needed to appoint new judges, as laid out in the constitution the government wants to shelve.\u201cVenezuela is going to have judges who don\u2019t receive orders from anyone, judges who serve justice and are not employees of the president,\u201d opposition congressman       Carlos\u00a0Berrizbeitia       said.One of the jurists appointed on Friday,       Alejandro Rebolledo,        told reporters the new justices wouldn\u2019t be intimidated. \u201cWhat Venezuela wants are judges who have courage and firmness,\u201d he said when asked about the possibility of going to jail.Human-rights groups and government adversaries say Venezuela\u2019s supreme court has become a potent tool wielded by the government against opponents, particularly as Mr. Maduro\u2019s support has withered during Venezuela\u2019s dire economic crisis. Since the opposition won a supermajority of congressional seats in December 2015, the court has issued dozens of rulings that stripped powers from lawmakers, prompting criticism from rights organizations and governments, including the U.S.As the conflict between Mr. Maduro and the opposition intensifies, each side appears to be crafting new institutions to gain the upper hand in a struggle for power in this oil-rich but crumbling country. Mr. Maduro intends to stage an election on July 30 to choose a so-called constituent assembly charged with writing a new constitution, one opponents say will strip away the country\u2019s remaining democratic levers.On Thursday the opposition called a 24-hour national strike that saw businesses grind to a standstill in cities across Venezuela. At least four people were killed in antigovernment demonstrations throughout the day. That brought to nearly 100 the deaths tallied in more than three months of protests ignited when the supreme court moved to dissolve the congress\u2014an initiative that was later reversed.Last Sunday, the opposition also staged what its leaders called a \u201cpopular consultation\u201d\u2014a plebiscite in which more than 7.5 million Venezuelans at home and abroad cast ballots saying they opposed the constituent assembly and called for democratic norms to be respected. Government officials ridiculed the exercise and said the results weren\u2019t binding.Mr. Maduro faces increasing pressure from abroad for his unyielding stance. U.S. President       Donald Trump       this week said Venezuela faced \u201cstrong and swift\u201d actions should it move forward with the assembly.

There aren\u2019t any guarantees the auto maker will be forced to take such an action.A Fiat Chrysler spokesman declined to comment. The Italian-U.S. auto maker has denied using improper software and proposed a fix for affected vehicles that it contends will address concerns of U.S. and California environmental regulators.The complaint, brought by vehicle owners and lessees, also singles out Robert Bosch GmbH for allegedly designing and supplying illegal software that allowed Fiat Chrysler to dupe regulators. A Bosch spokeswoman declined to comment.Fiat Chrysler faces litigation consolidated from across the U.S. in a San Francisco federal court that claims the company rigged vehicles to pass emissions tests and then fail to meet those standards while on the road.The U.S. Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler in May, alleging it violated the federal Clean Air Act by using so-called defeat-device software on nearly 104,000 model year 2014-2016 Jeep Grand Cherokees SUVs and Ram 1500 trucks. The same U.S. district judge is overseeing that lawsuit and the consumer litigation.The buyback demand harks back to the success plaintiffs had in similar litigation against             Volkswagen AG      , which is in the middle of repurchasing or modifying hundreds of thousands of diesel-powered vehicles equipped with improper emissions software. Civil settlements in that litigation have totaled more than $17 billion.The complaint against Fiat Chrysler mentions Volkswagen dozens of times. It aims to draw a direct line between the illegal software Volkswagen admitted to using and similar alleged transgressions lobbed at Fiat Chrysler.Plaintiffs in both cases are represented by a legal team led by San Francisco lawyer       Elizabeth Cabraser,        who will likely pull from her success in Volkswagen to try to build a similar case against Fiat Chrysler.Like in Volkswagen, the complaint also alleges that \u201cat the heart of the diesel scandal is Bosch,\u201d which plaintiffs allege designed the hidden software that tricked emissions tests. In the Volkswagen case, Bosch agreed to pay a $327.5 million settlement.The complaint brings claims under a federal racketeering law, federal warranty law, common law fraud, and consumer protection and warranty laws of all 50 states and the District of Columbia.In addition to a buyback, the plaintiffs are asking for monetary damages, pollution mitigation, business reforms and other relief. The complaint contends that Fiat Chrysler deceived consumers and \u201cdisregarded their rights to make free and informed consumer choices, damaged them economically, and used them as unwitting puppets in a scheme that impaired the public health.\u201d\u2014Mike Spector and Chester Dawson contributed to this article.Write to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/plaintiffs-seek-vehicle-buybacks-from-fiat-chrysler-in-emissions-case-1500665512", "keywords": ["buybacks,emissions tests,illegal software,litigation,plaintiffs,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles,FCA.MI,FCAU,Robert Bosch,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,passenger cars,automotive"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 15:20:00", "news_title": "Ford, Mazda Say Some Vehicles\u2019 Air Bags Needn\u2019t Be Recalled ", "content": "Two auto makers want to be excluded from an expanded recall of nearly three million             Takata Corp.        7312 -18.18%       air bags that the Japanese supplier has warned could one day rupture, U.S. traffic safety regulators said.Ford Motor Co.

Recalls until now have focused on air bags that lack such drying agents.Takata air bags risk rupturing and spraying metal shards in vehicles, a safety problem linked to 17 deaths and some 180 injuries globally.Nissan Motor Co., the other auto maker affected by the expanded safety campaign, is recalling affected vehicles, regulators said.Ford and Mazda, like other auto makers, have previously recalled other vehicles with Takata air bags.Ford said it planned to ask regulators to allow the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker to continue testing and analyzing air-bag inflaters.Since Ford\u2019s relevant air bags \u201cfrom the field have not shown any propellant degradation, and have pressure measurements within specification, we intend to file a petition with NHTSA to further study our inflaters,\u201d the company said. \u201cAt this point, there is no data to suggest a recall is needed.\u201dA Mazda spokeswoman said the auto maker obtained affected trucks from Ford as part of a previous partnership. Mazda decided to file a petition after learning Ford intended to do so, the spokeswoman said, adding that safety of customers remains the company\u2019s \u201chighest priority.\u201dFord and Mazda both filed defect reports that normally trigger recalls but notified NHTSA officials they intend to follow with petitions seeking exemptions, the agency said. Regulators review petitions and then decide whether to grant the exemption.Nissan, meanwhile, has recalled more than 515,000 2007-2011 Versa Sedans and 2007-2012 Versa hatchbacks with the air bags, regulators said.\u201cTesting data shows that the propellant in this inflater is degrading and on the path toward potential ruptures in the future,\u201d NHTSA said Friday. \u201cThere are no reported ruptures in the real world or in testing.\u201dThe agency said auto makers have a legal right to petition for exemptions from recalls. The recall doesn\u2019t affect all Takata air bags with drying agents, the agency said.Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in June in the U.S. and Japan amid mounting liabilities stemming from recalled air bags. The Japanese supplier also pleaded guilty earlier this year to criminal wire fraud for providing misleading testing reports to auto makers, settling a U.S. Justice Department probe.Auto makers, meanwhile, are in the midst of eventually recalling about 42 million vehicles with as many as roughly 70 million air bags in the U.S. alone.Takata earlier this month flagged \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d air bags that use calcium sulfate as a drying agent as possible explosion risks, according to a defect report filed with regulators.The disclosures expanded an unprecedented safety crisis to include air bags previously deemed safer because they use a drying agent, or desiccant, to help prevent ammonium-nitrate propellants from degrading, destabilizing and later exploding.

The judges are expected to deliver a final decision in 2019, the EU\u2019s second-highest court said.The decision marks a turning point in a monthslong struggle between Poland and the European Commission, which came to loggerheads after the EU\u2019s executive arm allowed Gazprom to boost gas exports to the bloc via the OPAL pipeline in Germany. The plaintiffs can appeal to the European Court of Justice in a bid to reverse the ruling and reinstate the temporary block.At the heart of the dispute is the Russian state-owned gas-export monopoly\u2019s access to European markets, as Brussels tries to wean the bloc off its energy dependence on Moscow and counter President       Vladimir Putin\u2019s       assertive foreign policies, led by the conflict in Ukraine. Kiev relies heavily on Russian gas transits through its territory for revenue.The commission\u2019s October 2016 decision helped Gazprom to bypass traditional export routes via Ukraine and Belarus, which critics led by Poland said undermine European energy security and support for Kiev.Warsaw also argued that enabling Gazprom to divert gas flows from the eastern transit routes, which also pass through Poland, would threaten Polish supplies and cause economic damage.Citing contracts, including one between the Polish state-owned gas company and Russia that runs until the end of 2022, the EU judges dismissed Poland\u2019s bid to maintain the temporary hold on Gazprom\u2019s greater access to the OPAL pipeline. The court had issued an interim stay in December.\u201cGazprom\u2019s deliveries to the Polish market are, prima facie, guaranteed,\u201d the court said in overturning its earlier decision.The commission, Gazprom, and Poland\u2019s government and leading gas company\u2014            PGNiG                  \u2014didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.Gazprom taps into OPAL after traversing the Nord Stream pipeline from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea. The Russian firm significantly increased gas deliveries to an all-time high via that route after securing an approval from the EU\u2019s executive to use OPAL\u2019s 50% unused capacity by bidding for it.Warsaw and Poland\u2019s two main gas companies asked the EU court to annul the commission\u2019s decision and halt Gazprom\u2019s extra exports through the German pipeline.The continuing legal challenge is closely watched as a proxy for Russia\u2019s ability to shift gas export routes and maintain its dominance in the EU.Gazprom-owned Nord Stream 2 AG is pursuing environmental and construction permits to double its Baltic Sea transit capacity to 110 billion cubic meters a year, or about a quarter of the EU\u2019s annual demand.Some EU members led by Poland have vociferously opposed Nord Stream 2, calling the project a Trojan Horse deployed by Moscow to divide the bloc. In response to the objections, the commission has asked EU governments for a mandate to negotiate with Moscow to establish a legal framework for the new pipelines.Meanwhile, the Switzerland-based Gazprom subsidiary has rallied political backing from some German leaders and secured about $5 billion of financing from western European partners including Royal Dutch Shell PLC to build its dual pipelines.\u201cI would be cautious about drawing wide-ranging conclusions,\u201d Nord Stream 2\u2019s EU representative Sebastian Sass said after the court ruling. \u201cBut overall it looks like an encouraging decision.\u201dWrite to Emre Peker at emre.peker@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-court-lifts-interim-block-on-more-gazprom-access-to-german-pipeline-1500655254", "keywords": [" baltic sea gas,eu gas, eu gas imports, eu gas pipeline, eu natural gas, gazprom, gazprom exports,European Union,Gazprom,OGZPY,corporate crime,legal action,marketing,markets,corporate,industry exports,industrial news,commodity,financial market news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,pipeline transportation,natural gas exploration,natural gas,oil exploration,integrated oil,gas,oil,natural gas midstream operations"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 15:14:00", "news_title": "Ukraine Bans Auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers ", "content": "Ukraine\u2019s central bank has banned PricewaterhouseCoopers from conducting bank audits in the country after finding PrivatBank, the country\u2019s top lender, developed a more-than-$5-billion hole in its books while under the accounting firm\u2019s supervision.The National Bank of Ukraine removed the Big Four accounting firm Thursday from a list of auditors authorized to work in the country following a meeting of the bank\u2019s board.\u201cThe audit report issued by PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit LLC failed to highlight the credit risk exposure faced by PrivatBank PJSC, which led to the bank being declared insolvent and nationalized, with substantial recapitalization costs borne by the state,\u201d the National Bank said Thursday.Ukraine\u2019s government, which last year banned nine accounting firms for audit policy violations, warned earlier this month that it was considering a similar fate for PwC over the alleged breakdown in its oversight of PrivatBank.A spokesman for PwC, which audited PrivatBank\u2019s finances from the mid-1990s until 2015, said the country\u2019s decision to ban the firm isn\u2019t justified.\u201cWe are very disappointed that the National Bank of Ukraine has made a decision to remove PwC Ukraine from the list of statutory auditors of Ukrainian banks in relation to the audit of PrivatBank,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will examine all options for reversing this decision.\u201dPrivatBank, which accounts for one-third of all individual deposits in the country, was nationalized in December after it uncovered a hole of more than $5 billion. The bank remains at the heart of national crisis stoked by the country\u2019s continuing conflict with Russian-backed separatists.Before being nationalized, PrivatBank was controlled by       Ihor Kolomoisky,        a media mogul who bankrolled armed formations supporting the Ukrainian military in its fight against the Russia-backed separatists.\u00a0Mr. Kolomoisky owns one of Ukraine\u2019s most popular television stations.With international support, Ukraine\u2019s National Bank has attempted to overhaul the country\u2019s banking sector, relying on billions of dollars of loans from the International Monetary Fund. The National Bank says it has shut down more than 80 banks in the past two years, including Ukraine\u2019s second-largest private lender, Delta Bank.Government spending to shore up PrivatBank recently reached 5% of Ukraine\u2019s gross domestic product, according to the National Bank.A 2016 analysis by PwC rival Ernst & Young LLP showed nearly all of PrivatBank\u2019s corporate loans were made to companies tied to its shareholders. PwC says PrivatBank\u2019s health may have changed sometime after it signed off on its 2015 audit, and that it is still committed to working in Ukraine.The country\u2019s decision to oust PwC is the latest in a string of embarrassments spanning several continents for the accounting firm. They include an investigation into PwC\u2019s audits of BT Italia by the U.K.\u2019s accounting watchdog as well as legal action over its work for             Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro SA,       a Brazilian company at the center of a large political corruption scandal.In the U.S., PwC settled a $5.5 billion lawsuit charging that it failed to uncover a fraud at Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, once one of the U.S.\u2019s biggest privately held mortgage companies. And earlier this year, PwC also settled a $3 billion lawsuit over claims it gave bad accounting advice to MF Global Holdings Ltd., which the brokerage said contributed to its 2011 collapse. In each case, settlement terms weren\u2019t disclosed.In another misstep\u2014broadcast live on television earlier this year\u2014a PwC partner gave a presenter the wrong envelope at the Academy Awards, leading to the announcement of \u201cLa La Land\u201d as the winner of best picture instead of the actual winner, \u201cMoonlight.\u201d The mistake was quickly corrected and the firm has apologized.Write to Tom Corrigan at tom.corrigan@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-bans-auditor-pricewaterhousecoopers-1500664479", "keywords": ["bankruptcynews,pwc,ukraine bans pwc,PricewaterhouseCoopers,Ukraine's central bank,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,banking,central banking,commercial banking,accounting,consulting,business,consumer services,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 14:54:00", "news_title": "Sean Spicer Resigns, Sanders to Take Over as Press Secretary", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014White House press secretary       Sean Spicer       resigned on Friday over objections that President       Donald Trump       has hired financier       Anthony Scaramucci       as his new communications director, a White House official said.The White House named Sarah Huckabee Sanders the new White House press secretary.In a statement read by Ms. Sanders in the Friday afternoon briefing, Mr. Trump said he was \u201cgrateful\u201d for Mr. Spicer\u2019s service and wished him future success, joking, \u201cjust look at his great television ratings.\u201d\u201cI can say that he [Mr. Spicer] understands that the president wanted to bring in and add new people to the team, and Sean felt like it would be best for that team to be able to start with a totally clean slate,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.Mr. Spicer told the White House communications team about his decision on Friday morning, another official said.

He said he is \u201cclose personal friends with Jay Sekulow,\u201d one of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, but when asked about the president\u2019s strategy for dealing with Special Counsel       Robert Mueller,        Mr. Scaramucci said, \u201cThat\u2019s sort of in that ZIP Code of like, you know, the legal team, and not really in Sarah or my ZIP Code.\u201dThe president has complained privately that the press team has been at times too slow or ineffective in defending him, most notably following his firing of former FBI Director James Comey. But some White House officials counter that the West Wing has a problem with decision-making, not public relations. Several people approached by White House officials have turned down offers to join the team, people familiar with the conversations said.Since Mr. Dubke resigned, Mr. Spicer had been filling in for the role of communications director, while Ms. Sanders, previously the deputy press secretary, has taken over at the podium for most White House briefings, which have been off-camera since late last month.Mr. Spicer, a veteran Republican communications operative in Washington, was praised by Mr. Trump for his ability to attract viewers to the daily news briefing, which cable networks often carried from start to finish. But Mr. Spicer also suffered from uneven performances: In one instance, as he condemned the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, he said even Adolf Hitler didn\u2019t \u201csink to using chemical weapons\u201d during World War II and didn\u2019t use \u201cgas on his own people.\u201d He later apologized and said he had let the president down with the comments.The high-profile role made Mr. Spicer one of the most recognized faces in the Trump administration, and one of the first on the new White House team who was parodied on Saturday Night Live. The Spicer character, played by Melissa McCarthy, became a recurring bit on the late-night comedy show.Mr. Trump has told associates that he personally liked Mr. Spicer, but blamed the White House press corps for being too tough on him. But at times the president\u2019s own statements undercut his chief spokesman. After Mr. Spicer said the president\u2019s decision to fire Mr. Comey was based on a recommendation from the Justice Department, the president then said he fired Mr. Comey because he was a \u201cshowboat,\u201d telling NBC News, \u201cI was going to fire regardless of recommendation.\u201dMr. Spicer, one of the few practicing Catholics among Mr. Trump\u2019s top aides, was also cut out of a meeting with Pope Francis during the president\u2019s first foreign trip. Those close to Mr. Spicer said he was surprised and hurt that he wasn\u2019t included: He had brought along several religious items for his children for the pope to bless. Mr. Spicer never publicly complained about the snub.Write to Michael C.

The Cuban missile crisis was more dramatic and the agony of Vietnam more wrenching, but since Truman, American presidents have believed that a global, outward-looking, order-building foreign policy was the necessary foundation for U.S. strategy and a peaceful, prosperous world.No longer. President       Donald Trump,        backed by a substantial segment of the American public, has distanced himself from some of the key foreign-policy assumptions and policies of the postwar era. Longstanding pillars of American strategy\u2014free trade, alliances in Europe and Asia, defense of human rights, commitment to international institutions and the rule of law\u2014have come into question as the new president denounces today\u2019s global architecture as a bad deal for the U.S.Responses to the shift have ranged from bewilderment to outrage. Mr. Trump\u2019s exit from the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2014a carefully negotiated trade agreement intended to lock the major Asian trading states into a relationship with the U.S. that would exclude China\u2014shocked free-trade advocates and Asia experts. His repeated descriptions of NATO as obsolete and his refusal (until his recent trip to Poland) to endorse the mutual-defense commitment at NATO\u2019s heart left many wondering whether Mr. Trump still considers the alliance essential to U.S. security. A drumbeat of news stories pointing to alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign has further muddied the waters, with many concluding that the president\u2019s Russia policies have more to do with his personal concerns than with the national interest.What explains this reversal in America\u2019s priorities? A chorus of observers has identified the problem as \u201cpopulism.\u201d As they see it, ignorant voters, angry about domestic economic conditions and cultural trends, were beguiled by empty promises of prosperity and driven by racism and xenophobia to back an agenda isolating the U.S. from the rest of the world.But populism is nothing new in American politics. In 1947, when Truman,       George Marshall       and       Dean Acheson       laid the foundations of postwar U.S. foreign policy, populism was every bit as strong a force in our politics as it is now. Determined to engage with the wider world but also deeply aware of their political situation at home, Truman and his team acted pre-emptively to head off a populist revolt. They modified their rhetoric and policies to address the concerns of a skeptical public and found ways to make their assertive Cold War policies appealing to, among others, angry heartland populists.This is something that foreign-policy leaders in both parties have failed to do in recent years, and the election of Mr. Trump was in large part a consequence of that failure. His populist attacks on the sacred totems of establishment foreign policy probably attracted more voters to his candidacy than they scared off, and the Trump administration now threatens to undo many of the historic accomplishments of the Truman years.For those of us who continue to believe that the policies and institutions devised after World War II served the U.S. well and remain essential today, the question is what to do now. In a best-case scenario, Mr. Trump\u2019s impressive foreign-policy team would convince their chief and his more populist advisers that Trumanism makes sense, and the president would work to make this case to his political base. Failing that, the best alternative is to convince the American people themselves that Trumanism is a better choice for the U.S. than Trumpism. Whatever the case, those of us who want to conserve the achievements of postwar American policy will need to do what Truman did: meet populists on their own turf and engage them.In the winter and spring of 1947, as the White House followed the dismal economic and political news from Europe, Truman and his team knew that American public opinion stood firmly opposed to any big new overseas commitments, including foreign aid. Republicans had captured control of Congress, and an angry GOP majority that included the communist-baiting Sen.       Joseph McCarthy       of Wisconsin was intensely skeptical of foreign involvement and entangling alliances.\u2018The U.S. needed to take on the global role that the British Empire had played at its zenith.\u2019The Truman team was clear about its own strategic priorities. The U.S. needed to block Soviet expansionism in a shattered Europe at a time when the continent\u2019s traditional great powers had collapsed and could neither defend themselves nor rebuild their economies without massive American help. The U.S. also needed to take on the global role that the British Empire had played at its zenith: The dollar would replace the pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency, the U.S. Navy would replace the British fleet as the guarantor of freedom of the seas, and American power and diplomacy would replace the British in building international institutions to manage the global economy and the emerging postcolonial world.This was all very well in theory, but Truman faced widespread political resistance to this agenda. On the left, many liberals still wanted to conciliate rather than to confront our wartime ally       Stalin.       On the right, many conservatives were isolationists or unilateralists who had just cut U.S. spending on foreign aid. \u201cMr. President,\u201d Sen.       Arthur Vandenberg       told Truman in a meeting at the White House about the urgent need for American aid to Greece and Turkey, \u201cthe only way you are going to get this is to make a speech and scare the hell out of the country.\u201dTruman and Vandenberg understood something profound about the politics of American foreign policy. While foreign-policy professionals in government, the academy and the media are often motivated by hope\u2014the prospect of building a global trading order, for example, or of making the world more democratic\u2014the public at large tends to be more focused on fear. If the American public had no fears about emerging threats elsewhere in the world, it would be very hard to get public support for an activist foreign policy with high-minded ambitions. Truman took the fears of the public seriously and tried to give them constructive expression: They were a crucial source of the political energy needed to power America\u2019s global engagement.To this end, Truman and his team summoned the specter of a global communist conspiracy directed by the Kremlin and told the American people that defeating this enemy was its highest priority. Administration surrogates painted a terrifying picture of communist advances across Europe and warned that if Europe fell, America would be next. And it worked. Congress appropriated the funds and passed the key legislation that gave Truman the foreign-policy tools he needed. American public opinion would continue to support a strong anti-Soviet foreign policy through the long years of the Cold War.The Truman administration\u2019s anticommunist rhetoric was denounced by many intellectuals and academics as crude, naive and counterproductive.       George F. Kennan,        one of the architects of the administration\u2019s strategy, was so distressed by what he saw as the militarism of America\u2019s subsequent containment policies that he left government and became an eloquent critic of U.S. foreign policy.       Walter Lippmann,        the most influential foreign-policy pundit of the day, made known his displeasure with Cold War fearmongering again and again. Sophisticated Europeans shuddered at what they saw as an excessively harsh and Manichaean view of communism\u2014even as they gratefully accepted the American aid and protection that Truman\u2019s rhetoric made possible.Truman\u2019s secretary of state, Dean Acheson, defended the administration\u2019s approach in his memoirs. An official trying to gain public support for foreign policy, he wrote, is not \u201cthe writer of a doctoral thesis. Qualification must give way to simplicity of statement, nicety and nuance to bluntness, almost brutality, in carrying home a point.\u201d Acheson estimated that the average American with a job and a family had perhaps 10 minutes a day in which to think about foreign policy. \u201cIf we made our points clearer than truth, we did not differ from most other educators and could hardly do otherwise.\u201dToday\u2019s advocates of continuing U.S. global leadership and engagement need to keep in mind both parts of Truman\u2019s achievement: formulating a farsighted national strategy to address the issues of the day and then educating the public to support it.\u2018America\u2019s challenges are more complex today and, in some ways, harder to address.\u2019The world is more complicated today than it was in 1947. America\u2019s challenges are more complex and, in some ways, harder to address, even if no single threat is as urgent and overwhelming as the one posed by the Soviet Union under Stalin. But the fears of the American people are also more complex, and a national strategy that clearly addresses those concerns can succeed both in domestic politics and in the world at large.The threat of jihadist terror on a mass scale, the growing danger of nuclear weapons in the hands of radical regimes, the possibility of debilitating cyberwarfare, the economic and political challenge posed by a rising China, the impact of globalization on American jobs\u2014these are widely shared concerns for millions of Americans. Even in our current moment of populist retreat, such fears, together with abiding popular attachment to trusted allies such as the U.K. and Israel, are strong enough and real enough to serve as the political foundation for a new wave of American global engagement.The same cannot be said, however, for a cause dear to many in the foreign-policy establishment: There is today very little popular support for the Wilsonian belief that the spread of democracy can solve America\u2019s most urgent foreign-policy problems.Promoting our values abroad remains important to many Americans, and our foreign policy cannot succeed in the long run without a clear moral basis, but the serious, recurring failures of this project since the end of the Cold War have gravely damaged its credibility. President       George W. Bush       turned the Iraq war into a war to make the Middle East safe for democracy. President       Barack Obama       tried to build democracy in the Middle East by embracing Turkey\u2019s Islamist leader       Recep Tayyip Erdogan,        and again by supporting the 2011 revolution that overthrew President       Hosni Mubarak       in Egypt. Mr. Obama then sought to make a humanitarian gesture by helping to overthrow Moammar Qaddafi in Libya.The disasters that have unfolded in all of these countries in recent years have driven home the idea, for many Americans, that foreign-policy experts have no idea what they are doing. It is useful, in this regard, to acknowledge that it\u2019s not just populists who sometimes get foreign policy wrong.\u2018A Trumanist approach would start by showing some trust in the foreign-policy instincts of the American people.\u2019A Trumanist approach\u2014popular but not populist, moral but not moralistic\u2014would start by showing some trust in the foreign-policy instincts of the American people. To take one obvious instance where popular and elite views diverge: Ordinary Americans are inclined to favor a firm, decisive response to jihadist threats, while foreign-policy elites tend to worry much more about the possible effects of American overreaction.This, too, follows a familiar pattern. The same arguments were made about anticommunism in Truman\u2019s day. But just as you could then be worried about communism without wanting to nuke Russia, you can be deeply concerned about the growth of jihadist ideology and violence today without wanting to start a war with Islam.Indeed, it is when people think that their leaders don\u2019t share their fears, or are incapable of acting on them, that popular fear often turns to populist rage. If the average American thinks that the political establishment isn\u2019t really worried about terrorism, the public is likely to become more xenophobic, not less. If the public thinks that American trade negotiators don\u2019t put the protection of American jobs first, people are more likely to become protectionist than to study the economics of the issue. If the average American thinks that the political class doesn\u2019t really care about illegal immigration, the demand for border walls will grow, not diminish.Truman and Acheson could have joined the intellectuals and the pundits who scoffed at the public\u2019s \u201cnaive\u201d and \u201csimplistic\u201d views of the communist threat and the other challenges of the day. But they had better sense than that. They understood that connecting their strategic goals with public fears was the key to success\u2014even if there was a certain cost to be paid at times in policy. They preferred a blunt, accessible strategy that the public and Congress would support to a more intellectually sophisticated one that could never take hold in the real world. As a result, they were able to set the U.S. and the world on a course that, for the past 70 years, has yielded an extraordinary stretch of prosperity and peace.We must hope today that American leaders, from the president on down, can be informed and inspired by the example of that historic success. Truman\u2019s combination of strategic vision and political pragmatism is exactly what the U.S. and our turbulent world need right now.Mr. Mead is a distinguished fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C., a professor of foreign affairs at Bard College and editor at large of the American Interest.Appeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-truman-can-teach-trump-1500661673", "keywords": ["america first,cold war,dean acheson,donald trump,foreign policy,george kennan,harry truman,isolationism,marshall plan,populism,tpp,Donald Trump,Harry Truman,political,general news,international relations,history,politics,domestic politics,sciences,humanities,government bodies,executive branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 14:20:00", "news_title": "U.S. Expands Security Checks for International Flights", "content": "LONDON\u2014The U.S. is requiring stricter security checks on some inbound international flights, U.S. and European airlines said Friday, amid new concerns about terrorists planning to attack planes.The Department of Homeland Security in late June mandated a set of enhanced security requirements covering hundreds of U.S. and overseas airlines and 280 foreign airports that offer direct flights to the U.S.The first phase of the changes went into effect this week, with more to come over the next three months. In return for meeting the new directives, the DHS didn\u2019t, as feared, impose a ban on passengers bringing most electronic devices larger than standard cellphones into airplanes heading to the U.S. But the heightened screening protocols are expected to include enhanced scrutiny of those devices at the foreign airports in the midst of the busy summer holiday travel period.As a result, some airlines notified their customers Friday that they should be prepared for more rigorous preflight screening.             Delta Air Lines Inc.        DAL -0.02%       and             United Continental Holdings Inc.        UAL 1.09%       both recommended that passengers should arrive three hours in advance for flights to the U.S. American Airlines Group Inc. said it was sticking to its two-hour check-in requirement.Deutsche Lufthansa AG      , Germany\u2019s largest carrier, said it received a directive from the U.S. government about the enhanced security measures, without providing detail. Lufthansa said it didn\u2019t expect any operational impact but said passengers will have to check in earlier.         Air France-KLM SA       also said it had taken note of the U.S. mandate.The U.S. in March banned passengers flying from 10 airports in the Middle East and North Africa from bringing laptops, tablets and other devices on board U.S.-bound flights, requiring them instead to leave the gadgets at home or check them into the cargo hold. All those airports have now met new security standards and the bans have been lifted.Washington had considered widening the device ban to U.S.-bound flights from Europe and other international departure points. European regulators, airlines and airports lobbied the U.S. government to hold off, saying such a ban could dent demand for travel. Opponents also said storing a large number of devices in the cargo hold poses safety risks because lithium batteries used in most laptops can easily catch fire.The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday said all 180 U.S. and overseas airlines that fly direct to the U.S. from 280 foreign airports now have met the first required changes. The Transportation Security Administration, part of the DHS, said Friday it is the airlines\u2019 decision as to what they tell their customers about heightened screening. The new security directives give carriers the flexibility to implement the measures in line with their operational needs and customer-service goals, the agencies said.A TSA spokesman said these airline notifications are related to the new security regime, not a response to any new, particular threat risk. However, the DHS continues to be concerned about the attraction aviation holds for terrorists. \u201cThe record of terrorist attempts to destroying aircraft in flight is longstanding and well-known,\u201d the DHS said in an updated statement. \u201cWe continually reassess old intelligence and collect new intelligence.\u201dAirlines for America, the leading U.S. trade group, said Friday that requiring so many airlines and airports around the world to implement complex security measures \u201cis both a significant undertaking and a deviation from the risk-based approach to aviation security that has been the cornerstone of the safest aviation system in the world.\u201d The group said the initial timeline for implementation was \u201cneither feasible nor realistic,\u201d but that it would continue to work with the DHS as the remaining phases of implementation occur.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com and Susan Carey at susan.carey@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Stricter Security Requirements Are Set for Airlines.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-expands-enhanced-security-checks-for-international-flights-1500645899", "keywords": [" airlines,laptop ban, mobile ban, terrorism,Department of Homeland Security,United Continental Holdings,UAL,Air France-KLM,AF.FR,Deutsche Lufthansa,LHA.XE,XE:LHA,American Airlines Group,AAL,Delta Air Lines,DAL,DLAKY,AFLYY,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,terrorism,government bodies,department of homeland security,executive branch,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,rental,leasing services,air transport,automotive,business,consumer services,transportation,logistics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 14:05:00", "news_title": "From Putsch to Power", "content": "The past century has been, sometimes for the better but more often for the worse, the era of the demagogue. Proliferating mass media have enabled gifted mavericks to grab the public\u2019s attention and hold democratic political establishments to ransom\u2014through newspaper columns and radio programs\u2014even, later, cable TV and Twitter. But in the turbulent, chaotic Germany of November 1923, broadcast mass media had yet to be born. Germany\u2019s first proper radio station had only just launched in Berlin, its reach as yet confined to a few score subscribers.Hundreds of miles to the south, conditions for the smart political opportunist were nonetheless ideal, as David King shows in his thought-provoking study \u201cThe Trial of Adolf Hitler.\u201d The German state of Bavaria was ruled by conservative nationalists who dismissed Berlin as a nest of traitors. Humiliating defeat in World War I had seen the Bavarian monarchy overthrown\u2014the royal family fleeing in a hired car (the king\u2019s chauffeur had joined the revolution), with one of the princesses carrying the crown jewels and the monarch clutching just a box of fine cigars. The pendulum in Munich, the capital, then swung violently leftward, leading to a short-lived \u201cSoviet Republic.\u201d This in turn was crushed by local army units and hastily raised citizen militias. Thereafter Bavaria became in essence a counterrevolutionary dictatorship, semidetached from the postwar German Republic. Far-right nationalists flocked to Germany\u2019s Deep South.This was the overheated political environment in which 34-year-old Adolf Hitler made his name as a \u201cdrummer\u201d for the nationalist cause. The once-penniless war veteran\u2019s rise was due to his remarkable talent for oratory but also to the protection of the local powers that be. The latter, upper-class holdovers from the monarchy, enjoyed little connection to ordinary Bavarians. Hitler could speak to those masses, expressing ultranationalist, anti-Semitic, vengeful slogans with a forcefulness that captivated audiences. By the fall of 1923, his National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party claimed 20,000 members, including paramilitary units with a reputation for extreme violence.By David KingNorton, 455 pages, $27.95State Commissioner Gustav von Kahr, the near-absolute ruler of Bavaria, shared power with his army commander, Gen. Otto Hermann von Lossow, and chief of police, Col. Hans Ritter von Seisser. This triumvirate had long been considering a \u201cmarch on Berlin\u201d to overthrow the democratic republic, modeled on the coup by which the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini had seized power in Rome the previous year. To this end, they had been in negotiation with their prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Hitler, hoping that his Nazis would add mass muscle to their elitist project.Their move against Berlin seemed subject to infinite delays. Hitler, losing patience, decided to force the ruling clique\u2019s hand. On Nov. 8, 1923, he and a host of armed followers invaded a public meeting in Munich\u2019s cavernous B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4u beer hall, where von Kahr, flanked by von Lossow and von Seisser, had been addressing a large crowd. Hitler advanced and fired multiple shots into the ceiling before declaring the Berlin government overthrown and a dictatorship of national salvation established.The ruling trio were led to a private room. After Gen. Erich Ludendorff\u2014in wartime, along with Paul von Hindenburg, the Kaiser\u2019s foremost commander and now an ally of Hitler\u2014also appeared at the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4u, von Kahr and co. finally agreed to support the Putsch. They gave their word to this effect and were released.Elsewhere, however, pro-government police and military commanders had undertaken countermeasures. Then all three freed captives quickly reneged on their \u201cwords of honor\u201d and called for resistance to the Nazi uprising. The next morning, Hitler decided to march some 2,000 supporters into the center of the city, hoping to rally the populace and perhaps shame government troops into switching allegiance. A salvo fired into the insurgent ranks by police units barring access to the Odeonsplatz killed those hopes\u2014and also 16 putschists. Hitler fled but was arrested some days later.On Feb. 26, 1924, the trials of Hitler, Ludendorff and seven other accused began. The charge: high treason. Working from transcripts of the proceedings, archive documents, press reports and eyewitness accounts, Mr. King convincingly shows us a classic example of biased justice: The judge, a passionate nationalist, was infinitely more concerned to protect the interests of the ruling conservative clique than to convict\u2014let alone punish\u2014the accused.We see, through Mr. King\u2019s adroit handling of the narrative, how a master manipulator, Hitler, exploited the trial to project himself onto the national, and international, stage. Initially, Ludendorff dominated the reports. Hitler seemed a mere political curiosity. His name was misspelled; photographs of him wrongly captioned. Come the verdict, however, and his brutal, uncompromising eloquence made him not just a hero to millions in Germany but a world-wide celebrity. The trial closed with a grandiose speech by Hitler that elicited a \u201cthunderous ovation\u201d from the audience in the courtroom for his vows to restore Germany\u2019s honor and power, Mr. King writes. \u201cEven if you pronounce us guilty a thousand times,\u201d Hitler declared, \u201cthe eternal goddess of the eternal court [of history] . . . will acquit us.\u201d Hitler got a mere five years, to be served in comfortable fortress confinement. He would be eligible for parole after six months.In jail, Hitler wrote his first draft of \u201cMein Kampf\u201d and continued meeting with his political cronies. That same spring, national elections showed a drastic surge to the right as German voters punished the central government for the country\u2019s political and economic disorder. From the ignominious failure of the November coup, which at the time had inspired in Hitler thoughts of suicide, the far right appeared to rise phoenixlike, as did its now most prominent leader.\u201cThe Trial of Adolf Hitler\u201d provides a textbook example of how a determined demagogue can turn defeat into victory. It is also a disturbing portrait of how an advanced country can descend into chaos and of the human cost that this chaos entails. Mr. King\u2019s gripping description of the failed coup includes glimpses of malign characters who would one day cast their evil shadows over Germany and Europe. Heinrich Himmler is here in a spear-carrying role. Hans Frank, then a young law student, appears setting up a machine gun on a bridge and being mocked by passersby, who ask him if he has his mother\u2019s permission to be doing this. Later, as governor of German-occupied Poland, Frank would allow himself to kill millions.Amid the wealth of telling detail that Mr. King\u2019s fine book gives us, there is one small slip-up. When Chancellor Gustav Stresemann is informed of the coup over dinner in Berlin, his companion, Hjalmar Schacht, is incorrectly described as \u201cfinance minister.\u201d Schacht was not part of the government at the time, though within days he became a key figure as Reich currency commissioner, charged with ending the galloping hyperinflation that had helped bring the country to its knees. Schacht\u2019s reforms stabilized the mark and, for a time, rescued German democracy. The result of the next elections reflected a growing return to economic normalcy and a swing back toward moderate politics, sending Hitler (freed in December 1924) into the wilderness for the next few years.However, in good part because of the quantum leap in his reputation that the F\u00fchrer had engineered during those dramatic weeks in the Munich courthouse, he could never be cast back to complete obscurity. He remained a feature of the political landscape, diminished but not quite forgotten\u2014until the Depression destroyed Germany\u2019s fragile prosperity, enabling him to propel himself back into the limelight. That rasping, spellbinding orator\u2019s voice had never been totally silenced, and once millions started listening to it again, Germany\u2019s\u2014and Europe\u2019s\u2014fate was sealed.\u2014Mr. Taylor is the author, most recently, of \u201cCoventry: Thursday, November 14, 1940.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-putsch-to-power-1500660353", "keywords": ["bookcar0722,book review,books,political,general news,celebrities,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,politics,international relations,domestic politics,television,radio,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 14:03:00", "news_title": "The Media\u2019s Embellisher-in-Chief", "content": "Among the celebrated people in America in the 1920s and \u201930s were Franklin Roosevelt, Charlie Chaplin, Babe Ruth, Shirley Temple, Jack Dempsey, Clark Gable, Bing Crosby\u2014and Lowell Thomas. All those names still resonate\u2014except Thomas, for decades the \u201cVoice of God\u201d in network newscasting, now a curious footnote in the frisky history of American journalism.In his heyday, Thomas (1892-1981) was almost impossible to miss. He sold out huge concert halls with his exotic travelogues\u2014the first mixed-media shows, dressed up with music, hand-tinted slides and quick snatches of film, some of which he shot himself from airplanes. His nightly radio newscasts often drew more listeners than \u201cAmos \u2019n\u2019 Andy,\u201d the most popular show in America. His narrator\u2019s voice on Fox Movietone News boomed out in jammed newsreel theaters before television took over. And when NBC started the first commercial TV station, W2XBS in New York, Thomas made the first newscast, from the World\u2019s Fair in 1939, and the next year was the host of the first regularly scheduled program, a 15-minute news show.The wonder of it all\u2014or perhaps the explanation\u2014is that Lowell Thomas, in the early days of his career and later in his double-barreled memoirs, elaborated and embroidered his stories and simply made stuff up. He was, in old-school newspaper argot, a \u201cpipe artist.\u201d He made millions by entertaining millions and often informing them in the bargain.By Mitchell StephensSt. Martin\u2019s, 328 pages, $26.99Now Mitchell Stephens, an accomplished chronicler of journalism, has resurrected Thomas from what might be considered well-earned obscurity. And it\u2019s fair to ask if the subtitle of his biography, \u201cThe Voice of America: Lowell Thomas and the Invention of 20th-Century Journalism,\u201d is a sly wink at its subject\u2019s penchant for making a good story even better.Thomas\u2019s industrious ancestors had come to America in the 17th century, and he seems to have been born on the make. The son of a doctor obsessed with self-improvement and an attentive mother, Thomas grew up in a honky-tonk gold-rush town on the western slope of Pikes Peak in Colorado. His father drilled him in elocution, and at 9 he stood on long lines twice to shake hands with and chat up the touring Vice President Teddy Roosevelt. By 19, he was the editor of his hometown paper, the Victor Record, writing headlines like \u201cMayor\u2019s Nephew Shot in Love Nest.\u201d (The youth was shot, all right, but turned out not to be related to the mayor.) Thomas quickly picked up two degrees at the University of Denver, then headed off to Chicago for law school.But even before enrolling, he got a job on the Chicago Daily Journal, sitting next to Ben Hecht, the roistering epitome of the harum-scarum Chicago newspapering he later confected into \u201cThe Front Page.\u201d Whether under Hecht\u2019s tutelage or not, Thomas soon fit right in. Within a year, the Journal splashed his \u201cexclusive\u201d interview with a supposedly insane young heiress who was being held captive by her family after chasing her new husband with a knife and threatening suicide. The heiress was real enough; the interview wasn\u2019t. There was a stink, but Thomas survived. In his spare time, he took law classes and taught public speaking to his fellow students. He was 21.By the time he was 25, Mr. Stephens recounts, Thomas had studied for a Ph.D. and joined the faculty at Princeton and twice traveled to Alaska and the Yukon, returning with slides and film for lectures. Then he decided to cover World War I\u2014raising $900,000 in today\u2019s money from a group of Chicago investors with the sales pitch that his stories and illustrated lectures would build support for the war effort.In Europe with his cameraman, Thomas heard that the British had captured Jerusalem and sped there. One day he spotted a diminutive Englishman resplendent in Arab garb walking on the street and stopped to chat. It was Maj. T.E. Lawrence\u2014and before long Thomas would turn Lawrence and himself into international stars.It\u2019s unclear who was the greater fabulist, but their talents were plainly congruent. Ben Hecht wrote later that Thomas had \u201chalf invent[ed] the British hero, Lawrence of Arabia.\u201d Lawrence\u2019s battalion of biographers still argue about the role that the \u201chero\u201d actually played in the Arab revolt against the Turks, who were allied with the Germans in the war. Did he really blow up trains, hold off a whole Turkish division with a machine gun in one battle and, later, lead the Arabs in from the desert to capture Aqaba on the Red Sea?Thomas went to Arabia to rejoin Lawrence after Aqaba and listened to his stories. He saw no action but staged some movies and still shots of Lawrence in full regalia. Not much of any of his war \u201creporting\u201d was ever published, but Thomas turned his Lawrence material into a series of sensational mixed-media lectures in London, America and Australia that were seen by two million people and proved a bonanza. A few years afterward, he published \u201cWith Lawrence in Arabia,\u201d his first best seller. Lawrence, Thomas and Thomas\u2019s young wife, Fran, became great chums, but later Lawrence grew embittered at Thomas for transforming him from a man into a legend.As much as Thomas made Lawrence, Lawrence made Thomas. Over the next half-century, Lawrence\u2019s Boswell became the biggest name in news, his mellifluous baritone so commanding that Americans fell silent at their dinner tables or in their parlors for 15 minutes when his show came on at 6:45. Thomas traveled the world obsessively, seeking out exotic\u2014and sometimes dangerous\u2014destinations. He was a fearless flyer in the days when there was plenty to fear. With a skilled ghost writer ever at hand, he published more than 50 books and countless magazine articles.Mr. Stephens has read piles of Thomas scripts and listened to endless hours of his broadcasts. Despite his early proclivities, Thomas, he writes, handled the news with easy objectivity. He could still tune up a human-interest story, but on the big issues of his prime\u2014the Depression and World War II\u2014Thomas played it down the middle.This was remarkable, because Thomas lived in a conservative Republican bubble. His longtime radio sponsor\u2014in an age when sponsors, not broadcasters, produced the programs\u2014was the Sun Oil Co., ruled by the ultra-conservative Pew family. He palled around with Herbert Hoover and Thomas E. Dewey, Dale Carnegie and Dr. Norman Vincent Peale. In 1949, he was making the equivalent of $5 million a year from CBS alone. He lived like a Protestant pasha on an estate on Quaker Hill in exurban Pawling, N.Y., where he was a control freak avant la lettre, developing the area and parceling out house lots to friends.He coached Dewey on speaking technique for his presidential campaigns against FDR in 1944 and Harry Truman in 1948, and the Pews pressured him to get behind Dewey in his races. But, as Mr. Stephens documents, Thomas never tipped his hand on air. Edward R. Murrow, who never hid his own liberal politics, bought a house on Quaker Hill and played golf with Thomas. But Thomas never really won Murrow\u2019s respect. \u201cLowell wasn\u2019t a real journalist to Ed,\u201d said Frank Stanton, the longtime president of CBS, \u201cjust a story teller.\u201dThomas never made his mark on television the way he had on radio. But he stayed busy\u2014in business and otherwise. He helped pioneer Cinerama, the three-projector, wide-screen movie process that some thought would save the movies from TV. He bought into a small television station in Albany, N.Y., that grew into Cap Cities, the media empire sold to Disney in 1996 for $19 billion. In his late 50s, he trekked over the Himalayas to Tibet, then closed to foreigners, and met the boy       Dalai Lama.       On the way down, he went off his pony and broke his leg in eight places. Having exhausted the other continents, he journeyed to Antarctica. When his wife of five decades began to fail, he took up with a 40-year-old woman\u2014\u201cWe had a remarkable sex life,\u201d she testified\u2014and married her when he was 84 and she 49.Lucky to the end, Thomas died peacefully in his sleep at 89 in 1981. Two days later, CBS telecast a prime-time tribute to him led by Walter Cronkite. \u201cThat Lowell had a exceptional life was impossible to dispute,\u201d writes Mr. Stephens. \u201cThe significance of his work was harder for these CBS newsmen to pin down.\u201d Eric Severeid had the last word. \u201cAs a journalist,\u201d concluded Sevareid, \u201che was kind of a wandering minstrel in prose.\u201d\u2014Mr. Kosner is the author of \u201cIt\u2019s News to Me,\u201d a memoir of his career as the editor of Newsweek, New York, Esquire and the New York Daily News.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-medias-embellisher-in-chief-1500660208", "keywords": ["bookcar0722,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 14:03:00", "news_title": "Attorney Says Trump Legal Team Not Working to Discredit Russia Probe", "content": "An attorney for President Donald Trump praised the work of prosecutors involved in the Russia investigation and disputed the notion that the White House or Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team was working to discredit or short-circuit the special counsel probe.John Dowd,        one of the main outside lawyers representing Mr. Trump in the Russia investigation, said in an interview Friday that Special Counsel       Robert Mueller       has been doing \u201ca good job\u201d and can be trusted to carry out a fair investigation.\u201cThe communications are honest and professional and helpful,\u201d Mr. Dowd said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been helpful to him and he\u2019s been straight with us. He\u2019s an honest guy and he\u2019s done a good job.\u201dThe Washington Post on Thursday reported that Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team is discussing the president\u2019s authority to issue pardons that could potentially derail the Russia probe. Mr. Dowd denied the report. \u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d Mr. Dowd said.Mr. Dowd\u2019s comments suggest a split within the Trump legal team and the White House about the best way to respond to the special counsel probe.Mr. Trump and some of his lawyers have taken a more combative stance. They have questioned whether Mr. Mueller and the prosecutors he has hired have conflicts of interest. And they have cautioned that the Mueller team must avoid venturing into parts of Mr. Trump\u2019s life and career that go beyond the special counsel\u2019s mandate.Mr. Mueller\u2019s mandate includes looking into possible collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign team in the 2016 election, along with matters arising \u201cdirectly from the investigation,\u201d according to the Justice Department order in May announcing the special counsel\u2019s appointment.Mr. Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia, and has called questions about campaign associates\u2019 Russia ties a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d The U.S. intelligence community concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 election but Moscow has denied any interference.Mr. Trump said earlier this week that Mr. Mueller would be exceeding his authority if he looked into his or his family\u2019s personal finances. Asked by the New York Times if such a move would cross a red line, Mr. Trump responded: \u201cI would say yes.\u201dJay Sekulow,        another member of the Trump legal team, said late Thursday that Mr. Mueller\u2019s probe should stay focused on its core mission and not veer off into other directions.\u201cThe special counsel\u2019s investigatory activities are limited by his mandate. And looking at a real estate deal from 10 years ago would exceed that mandate,\u201d Mr. Sekulow said, referencing a Bloomberg article that said Mr. Mueller is looking into Trump business deals dating back years.He also said the legal team could look at potential conflicts of interest.\u201cConflict of interest issues, if they arise, will be addressed in due course through the normal legal channels if we get to that stage. Any lawyer would look at potential conflicts.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Mueller\u2019s office declined to comment.People close to Mr. Trump have questioned whether the prosecutors are impartial, pointing to campaign donations some have made Democratic candidates. At least seven members of Mr. Mueller\u2019s team have given to Democratic candidates, including to the presidential campaigns of former President       Barack Obama       and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee       Hillary Clinton.Kellyanne Conway, former campaign manager and now White House counselor, in an appearance on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d Friday morning, said the donations were indicative of the prosecutors\u2019 political leanings.\u201cPeople should know what folks\u2019 pasts and their motivations and their political motivations are, these weren\u2019t minor donations. ... These were significant donations by members of that team. They clearly wanted the other person to win,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, whether that prejudices them one way or the other in the investigation remains to be seen.\u201dMr. Mueller, for his part, made two contributions in 1996 to Republican William Weld, then a candidate for a U.S. senate seat in Massachusetts, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics.Mr. Dowd, in the interview Friday, dismissed the notion that the Trump team would try to undercut the special counsel\u2019s investigation by highlighting what it sees as conflicts of interest.\u201cWe\u2019re not interested in that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all know him and we\u2019re not interested at all in that kind of collateral nonsense.\u201dAsked if he is concerned that Mr. Mueller might dip into areas that are far afield, he said: \u201cBob knows where he is going and he\u2019s been very straight with us. We have a fair idea of where he\u2019s going.\u201dOne person close to the president said that he has advised Mr. Trump to cooperate with Mr. Mueller and work toward a speedy resolution of the Russia probe.Mr. Trump has rejected the advice, he said.The president\u2019s \u201cinstincts on this are that when you get pushed you, double down, and when you get pushed again, you triple down.\u201dWrite to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Lawyer Denies Spat Over Russia Probe.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/attorney-says-trump-legal-team-not-working-to-discredit-russia-probe-1500656955", "keywords": [" donald trump,robert mueller,russia probe,special counsel,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 14:01:00", "news_title": "Less Unique Than We Think", "content": "Of all the alternative names that have been suggested for our species (out of which Linnaeus somehow chose Homo sapiens, \u201cthe wise\u201d), maybe the most appropriate would be Homo narcissus, since we seem to delight so much in gazing at our own reflections. Like the Greek youth who fell in love with his own image, human beings have long been obsessed about what makes us so much \u201cbetter\u201d than other animals.Given that we are undeniably smart, and in view of the fact that our brains are quite large, it long seemed reasonable to channel Snow White\u2019s nemesis and ask the mirror: \u201cWho has the biggest brain of all?\u201d To widespread discomfort, however, the answer was \u201celephants\u201d and \u201cwhales.\u201d So, recognizing that big bodies lead to big brains, the question became: \u201cWho has the largest brain to body-mass ratio?\u201d On that scorecard we beat out elephants and whales but were defeated by a discouraging array of small mammals, including red squirrels and chipmunks. Doughty researchers accordingly moved the goal posts yet again and instead inquired about the ratio of metabolic energy invested in brains to total body expenditure. Bingo! We won. Yet the explanatory powers of that metric are limited. There must be something more that sets us apart.The identity of humanity\u2019s elusive, uniquely distinguishing trait is not yet known. There is a growing suspicion that it doesn\u2019t reside in our biology. But the pursuit of it has proven extraordinarily difficult, perhaps impossible, simply because the very idea of a distinct root of human exceptionalism inevitably bumps up against Darwin\u2019s great insight: the underlying continuity of all living things, a unity of which Homo sapiens partakes.By Agust\u00edn FuentesDutton, 340 pages, $28By Kevin N. LalandPrinceton, 450 pages, $35Now Agust\u00edn Fuentes, an anthropologist at the University of Notre Dame, and Kevin Laland, a professor of behavioral and evolutionary biology at the University of St. Andrews, have entered the fray, each proclaiming that they have found that elusive Holy Grail. Both their books are persuasive, entertaining, informative and successful\u2014up to a point.In \u201cThe Creative Spark: How Imagination Made Humans Exceptional,\u201d Mr. Fuentes has done a fine job of summarizing recent research in anthropology and primatology. He argues, in short, that creativity combined with social cooperation can provide the key to human uniqueness, pointing to numerous examples in which problems such as the finding of food, the avoidance of predators, the transfer of information and the manipulation of the physical environment are solved by way of imaginative collaboration. The group achieves results that would be beyond the reach of any individual.The author displays an engaging, puckish sense of humor. After describing how small bands of Homo erectus evidently occupied caves that were also (on occasion) inhabited by giant predatory hyenas, he observes: \u201cIt would not be everyone\u2019s idea of a dream home.\u201d But he can be annoyingly abrupt and single-minded in declaring that various prior hypotheses\u2014for instance, that we are \u201cnaturally selfish, aggressive and competitive\u201d or that we are \u201cnaturally caring, altruistic and cooperative\u201d\u2014are plainly wrong and that our humanness can be attributed, purely and simply, to our ancestors\u2019 collaborative creativity. This claim might be true, but Mr. Fuentes could be more circumspect and more willing to acknowledge the nuance of other hypotheses. He also says that our \u201cspark of creativity emerges\u201d from the way that our ancestors \u201cmade social lives and social innovation central\u201d to how they adjusted to different environments. But what about ants, termites and the social bees and wasps, all considered by E.O. Wilson to occupy the \u201cpinnacles\u201d of social complexity? They don\u2019t seem, as individuals, especially creative. But people are.Mr. Fuentes is regrettably prone to developing imaginative scenarios for how his conception of creativity functioned among our ancestors without labeling them as (if nothing else) instances of his own creativity. For example, speculating on early hominin meat-eaters, he writes that \u201cpassive scavenging, taking the leftover scraps, was not enough. They wanted the best, and the most, meat so they began to \u2018power scavenge,\u2019 getting to kills early and attempting to take them away from the predators. . . . Some in their group could charge in, shaking sticks, waving their arms, and making hooting and grunting noises.\u201d Later, he writes, \u201cHomo erectus developed the system that we refer to when we say \u2018it takes a village to raise a child.\u2019 \u201d Maybe so, in both cases, but how does he know? I humbly suggest that, particularly when writing for a nonspecialist audiences, scientists are obliged to firmly distinguish between their hypotheses and what is clearly substantiated by objective evidence.Mr. Fuentes does better when deftly reviewing the archaeology of art, music and other \u201cpurely\u201d creative endeavors, but again he does not advance a credible hypothesis as to why such seemingly nonadaptive traits evolved in humans and also became cross-culturally universal. His touch is firmer when it comes to science\u2014which, he shows, originated long before the likes of Einstein, or even Newton, Galileo or Thales, a Greek who inspired Aristotle. Despite the widely accepted argument of Thomas Kuhn that most of science is mere \u201cpuzzle solving,\u201d Mr. Fuentes demonstrates beautifully that it is rooted in deep patterns of human creativity and cooperation.On the most basic level, however, it isn\u2019t clear whether some of the traits that Mr. Fuentes so effectively descries (or imagines) are a cause\u2014his argument\u2014or an effect of our undoubted creativity. Take language: Did our linguistic competence contribute to our creativity or reflect it? Did human language evolve for other reasons and then, once present, provide a vital tool for revealing as well as generating yet more verbal originality? And surely animals, even without language as we know it, can seem creative. Perhaps it\u2019s my own failure of imagination, but I think it takes a lot of creativity for the famous African gray parrot, Alex, to consistently pick out an object that is \u201cdifferent\u201d from three others\u2014or for the legendary dog, Rico, tested at the Max Planck Institute roughly a decade ago, to fetch a thing whose name he has never been taught when confronted with a pile of objects of which he knows all the names except one. It takes a leap of insight to figure out that the unknown one must be the one that he\u2019s been asked for.Perhaps not creativity but culture is what is most fundamental to our humanity\u2014not just today but throughout our evolutionary history. This is the gravamen of Mr. Laland\u2019s \u201cDarwin\u2019s Unfinished Symphony: How Culture Made the Human Mind.\u201d The author points to the qualitative gulf between, say, a nightingale\u2019s song and a Verdi aria, or between the ability of many animals to count and Newton\u2019s invention of the calculus. His explanation for the difference derives mostly, he believes, from the human ability to copy and teach (\u201chigh-fidelity information transmission\u201d) and from the ways in which this ability, in turn, fed back into our evolution.Darwin was certainly aware of the importance of human culture, but under Mr. Laland\u2019s sophisticated interpretation, cultural innovations did not merely respond to environmental challenges but also helped create the elaborate surroundings within which natural selection made us what we are today. Besides illuminating the interaction between biological and cultural evolution, he gives suitable attention to recent discoveries in the new field of \u201ccognitive ethology,\u201d which has revealed astounding mental capacities on the part of our animal relatives. Who would have predicted, for example, that Mariana crows could assess a problem involving out-of-reach food, then construct\u2014not find, mind you, but actually build\u2014a tool to access it? Or that chimpanzees could decide which members of their troop to release from a cage to help obtain a reward based on their prior knowledge of who is most likely to share the bounty with the others?Astounding, yes, but nevertheless not quite human (according to the author). Only humans and their culture, he claims, have engaged in a runaway process by which imaginative insights have catalyzed social learning, which in turn has fed back into such physical manifestations as tools, which then interacted via natural selection to generate our unique brain expansion. In our forebears, that brain expansion led, in turn, to more cultural innovations. So not only did our intelligence make our culture; our culture also made our intelligence.Mr. Laland is one of those rare biologists who have personally studied the processes\u2014notably in fishes and rats\u2014whereby animals learn and transmit their learning and who has also applied mathematical models to the spread of cultural traditions among human beings and other species. The evolution of learning is a well-trodden research path, but \u201cDarwin\u2019s Unfinished Symphony\u201d may be the first book-length integrated account of the evolution of teaching.Much as I respect and admire Mr. Laland\u2019s contributions\u2014his own research as well as this abundantly referenced, nearly encyclopedic treatment of culture\u2019s indispensable role in our own evolution\u2014I wish he had made conceptual space for such additional evolutionary pressures as predators, climate, sexual attraction, violent intergroup competition and the panoply of other complex factors that impinged on our ancestors\u2014and continue to affect us. I would also have appreciated some acknowledgment that, while culture may have made us, it may well also be our undoing. Other animals don\u2019t produce symphonies; they also don\u2019t produce nuclear weapons.\u201cDarwin\u2019s Unfinished Symphony\u201d doesn\u2019t by any means finish Darwin\u2019s work. Instead it ends with a gentle pat on the author\u2019s own back, hoping that his efforts and those of other researchers \u201chave gradually chipped away at some of the bewilderment that the dazzling complexity of human culture originally inspired.\u201d They certainly have, but the full picture is still only slowly coming into view.\u2014Mr. Barash is professor of psychology emeritus at the University of Washington.

In May of that year, the Treasury Department said the company signed eight documents relating to oil and gas projects in Russia that were also signed by       Igor Sechin,        chief executive of the state oil giant PAO Rosneft. The Treasury said Thursday those deals violated U.S. sanctions against Mr. Sechin, a former Russian intelligence officer and ally to President       Vladimir Putin.Mr. Tillerson, who had close business ties to Russia and received an \u201cOrder of Friendship\u201d award from Moscow, left Exxon last year to become U.S. secretary of state.The $2 million fine, the Treasury said, was the maximum amount it could levy against the company.A spokesman for Exxon called the fine \u201coutrageous\u201d and said it would fight the Treasury\u2019s findings, saying they are a 180-degree turn from previous guidance handed down by the Obama administration when the sanctions were enacted. The Treasury\u2019s sanctions unit started its probe of the alleged sanctions violation several years ago. Exxon said it was first notified in 2015 by the sanctions unit, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, that it had violated sanctions regarding its interactions with Mr. Sechin. In a filing in a Texas court Thursday, the company said it had challenged the notification about a month later.Exxon doesn\u2019t have any direct deals with Mr. Sechin but does have business dealings with Rosneft, where Mr. Sechin signed company documents in his capacity as CEO, Exxon said. According to the company, under President       Barack Obama,        the White House and the Treasury in 2014 said U.S. companies were allowed to participate in business dealings with Mr. Sechin if they were professional, not personal.On Thursday afternoon, the Irving, Texas, company filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas, seeking to toss the fine. In a court filing, Exxon said the sanctions unit \u201cseeks to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order that is inconsistent with the explicit and unambiguous guidance from the White House and the Treasury issued before the relevant conduct and still publicly available today.\u201dThe Justice Department declined to comment about Exxon\u2019s legal challenge.The U.S. Treasury said in an enforcement notice against Exxon that the company showed \u201creckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements\u201d when failing to consider the warning signs associated with dealing in the blocked services of someone under U.S. sanctions. The Treasury unit said one of the \u201caggravating factors\u201d it considered was that Exxon is a globally sophisticated company that routinely deals with sanctions compliance concerns.\u201cNo materials issued by the White House or the Department of the Treasury asserted an exception or carve-out for the professional conduct of designated or blocked persons, nor did any materials suggest that U.S. persons could continue to conduct or engage in business with such individuals,\u201d the Thursday notice said.When Mr. Tillerson took his position in President       Donald Trump\u2019s       cabinet this year, he promised to recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year. He has stood by the current sanctions regime. In Ukraine earlier this month, Mr. Tillerson said the U.S. sanctions on Russia\u2014imposed along with sanctions from the European Union\u2014would remain \u201cuntil Moscow reverses the actions that triggered these particular sanctions.\u201dMr. Tillerson, as Mr. Trump\u2019s top diplomat, has been leading administration efforts to improve relations with Russia.\u201cThis is a big black eye for Tillerson,\u201d said Anders \u00c5slund, a senior fellow and Russia expert at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank and Russia critic.Though the State Department referred most questions about this specific matter to Exxon, spokeswoman       Heather Nauert       said Thursday that Mr. Tillerson is committed to the objectives of the Ukraine-related sanctions. She said the State Department wasn\u2019t involved with the decision to fine Exxon. She said Mr. Tillerson is \u201cliving up to his ethical commitments,\u201d including his recusal from Exxon-related matters.Rosneft spokesman Michael Leontiev said signing an agreement with Mr. Sechin not as an individual, but as a representative of Rosneft management, can\u2019t be the foundation for a sanctions violation. \u201cI am sure that while Exxon was preparing the decision about documents signing it consulted with both OFAC and lawyers specialized on sanctions very carefully,\u201d he said.The penalty comes as committees in the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as a Justice Department special counsel, investigate what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Kremlin-backed campaign to interfere in the presidential election, and whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Russia has denied meddling and Mr. Trump has denied any collusion.\u201cExxon Mobil caused significant harm to the Ukraine-related sanctions program objectives by engaging the services\u201d of a sanctioned entity, the Treasury said.Exxon applied to the Treasury Department for a partial waiver from Russia sanctions in 2015. The application was never acted upon at that time but was again circulating among government departments earlier this year. The Trump administration said in April that it wouldn\u2019t grant the waiver, two days after the application was reported by The Wall Street Journal.Exxon and other big energy companies also recently joined Mr. Trump in voicing concerns about congressional efforts to toughen sanctions on Russia, arguing that it could shut down oil and gas projects around the world that involve Russian partners. Mr. Tillerson opposed ramped-up sanctions being considered in Congress, saying the White House needs flexibility on the matter.Lobbyists for Exxon told lawmakers in recent weeks that several provisions in the sanctions legislation under consideration on Capitol Hill are worrisome, including measures to prohibit partnerships with Russian individuals.\u2014Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Lynn Cook at lynn.cook@wsj.com and Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.comAppeared in the July 21, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. and Exxon Spar Over Russia Sanctions.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-fines-exxon-2-million-over-russia-sanctions-breaches-1500570876", "keywords": ["exxon, legal challenge,obama,oil ,putin,rosneft,russia,sanctions,tillerson, treasury department,ukraine sanctions,Exxon Mobil,XOM,U.S. Treasury Department,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 13:18:00", "news_title": "Cellphone Bills in India Inch Closer to Zero ", "content": "NEW DELHI\u2014India\u2019s richest man said Friday that his cellular company has developed an inexpensive, web-enabled mobile phone for the masses, a move that could shake up the country\u2019s handset market and force some of the world\u2019s leading phone makers to slash prices to stay competitive.Mukesh Ambani,        the chairman of             Reliance Industries Ltd.        EQRELIANCE 0.11%      , told attendees at the firm\u2019s annual general meeting that the device, which resembles a simpler mobile phone but can handle high-speed 4G mobile data connections, will \u201ceffectively cost zero,\u201d as users will be required only to put down a 1,500 rupee ($23) security deposit, which can be refunded after three years.Unlimited mobile data on the phone from Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. will cost 153 rupees a month, with free voice calls and text messages.The \u201ctruly revolutionary phone,\u201d dubbed the JioPhone, \u201cwill transform the lives\u201d of the hundreds of millions of Indians who now use so-called feature phones with limited functionality, Mr. Ambani said. Feature phones are primarily designed for voice calls and sending text messages.The JioPhone will offer a physical keyboard rather than a smartphone-like touch screen and allow easier access to the internet through voice recognition to \u201cend digital exclusion in India,\u201d he said.Last year Mr. Ambani started offering cut-rate mobile services to promote his new carrier, which he said now has more than 125 million subscribers.Market leader             Bharti Airtel Ltd.       had about 275 million subscribers as of May, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.\u201cReliance can now reach out to the next hundred million users,\u201d who are less affluent and need more-affordable phones and data, said       Tarun Pathak,        an analyst at Counterpoint Research.Competing telecommunications firms have scrambled to slash prices on data in the wake of Jio\u2019s launch, with             Vodafone Group,       another major player in India, saying in March it would merge its embattled Indian business with a local rival,             Idea Cellular Ltd.While they boast large subscriber bases, telecommunications companies in India are contending with average revenue per user of less than $2 a month, ranking the market among the world\u2019s lowest by that metric, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India data shows.The JioPhone\u2019s low price and inexpensive data may appeal to many of the approximately 400 million people in India who now use traditional feature phones, Mr. Pathak said.Consumers pay an average of about $23 for feature phones in India, with many users paying about $2 a month for voice and text messages, according to Counterpoint data. That is in line with the price of Jio\u2019s new device, which will include web access and unlimited calls and data.India\u2019s low-end mobile phone market is dominated by phones from South Korea\u2019s             Samsung Electronics Co.       and Indian makers such as Lava International Ltd. and Micromax Informatics Ltd., Mr. Pathak said.\u201cIt\u2019s a category where the least amount of innovation has happened,\u201d he said, meaning the JioPhone has a good chance of poaching users looking to upgrade.The JioPhone will be available from September, Mr. Ambani said.

That would be too interesting,\u201d a jaded writer tells a glamorous woman in one of many strange and beautiful scenes in Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s \u201cStalker\u201d (1979). There are no flying saucers in the great Russian director\u2019s haunting tale of a journey into the depths of a postapocalyptic landscape, but it offers visual splendor, as well as mysteries, portents and miracles.Mosfilm recently carried out digital restorations of \u201cSolaris\u201d (1972) and \u201cStalker,\u201d Tarkovsky\u2019s two majestic adaptations of science-fiction novels. The Criterion Collection has just released \u201cStalker\u201d on DVD and Blu-ray, and it is also currently screening in New York and select cities in the U.S. A profound exploration of spiritual desolation and the power of love in a damaged world, it\u2019s a film whose poetic vision seems more valuable than ever.The story unfolds in the aftermath of some disaster, a meteorite or an alien invasion. Troops were sent in but never returned. A forbidden Zone was established but failed to keep out adventurers, called stalkers. A holy fool, the film\u2019s idealistic Stalker (      Aleksandr Kaidanovsky      )\u2014who has a sick daughter, called Monkey (      Natasha Abramova      ), and a loving wife (      Alisa Freindlikh      )\u2014continues to smuggle the unhappy or curious into the Zone, despite having been imprisoned and tortured.Inside the Zone, which he describes as a \u201cvery complex maze of traps,\u201d the Stalker claims there is a Room where one\u2019s deepest desires are fulfilled. This time, he accompanies two men of art and science, the Writer (      Anatoly Solonitsyn      ) and the Professor (      Nikolai Grinko      ), whose lack of belief in the possibilities of the Room grieves him. At times Tarkovsky suggested that the Stalker conjured up the Zone from his own imagination.Is the Zone life or death? Perhaps both. In any case, it is zealously guarded. Before entering, the travelers navigate a misty labyrinth of muddy alleys and barbed-wire fences\u2014a grimly magical space that at times echoes Cocteau\u2019s \u201cOrpheus\u201d (1950)\u2014fleeing helmeted policemen on motorcycles. Eventually, they escape deep into the Zone, a world that is like and unlike our own. As       Geoff Dyer,        author of the book \u201cZona,\u201d notes in an interview recorded for the Criterion release, while the film resists easy allegorical interpretations, it\u2019s impossible not to think of the gulag, and of how the Zone anticipated Chernobyl.\u201cStalker\u201d is loosely based on the novel \u201cRoadside Picnic\u201d by Arkady and       Boris Strugatsky,        who worked on the screenplay. The production was fraught with difficulties, from an earthquake that necessitated a change in location to thousands of feet of ruined footage. Much of the film was shot under harrowing conditions at a desolate site in Estonia.\u201cStalker\u201d often shifts between dreamlike color and glowing sepia. The film\u2019s charged images include drowned detritus\u2014such as syringes, coins and a depiction of St. John the Baptist from the Ghent Altarpiece\u2014and lush underwater grasses like human hair. Glass objects float in a flooded interior space and there is a sudden shower of shimmering rain.A mysterious black dog also appears in the Zone, like a figure from a hieroglyph. Back in the outside world, this benign spirit is still with the travelers, as if having guided them out of the underworld, and in a painterly sequence it follows the Stalker\u2019s family home through a ravaged, snow-dusted landscape. When the dog laps milk from a bowl, it seems as miraculous as the apparently supernatural event in the final scene.The hypnotic electronic score, by       Eduard Artemyev      \u2014who also worked on Tarkovsky\u2019s \u201cSolaris\u201d and \u201cThe Mirror\u201d (1975)\u2014combines Eastern and Western musical influences. In \u201cSolaris,\u201d an adaptation of a Stanislaw Lem novel, a psychologist and cosmonaut,       Kris Kelvin,        travels to a space station by a planet with a sentient ocean, where he confronts his conscience. In one of the most exquisite scenes, Kelvin levitates while embracing his resurrected dead wife in the space station\u2019s library, a room filled with books, musical instruments and paintings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.Despite the poignant humanity of \u201cSolaris,\u201d Tarkovsky expressed dissatisfaction that the science-fiction aspect wasn\u2019t more muted. Both films are powerful interior journeys, but in \u201cStalker\u201d dreams are pursued on Earth. As       Mark Le Fanu       writes in an essay for Criterion, the dialogue is \u201cmagnificently ambivalent: witty and fantastical beyond measure.\u201d\u201cStalker\u201d was the last film Tarkovsky made in the Soviet Union. In 1984, while in Italy, he announced that he would not return. When he died of cancer in 1986 at age 54, he had completed a small but towering body of work. In his book \u201cSculpting in Time,\u201d published the year of his death, he wrote, \u201cIn Stalker I make some sort of complete statement: namely that human love alone is\u2014miraculously\u2014proof against the blunt assertion that there is no hope for the world.\u201d\u2014Ms. Jones writes about film and culture for the Journal.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/love-in-a-damaged-world-1500656676", "keywords": ["andrei tarkovsky,arts in review, movie, sci-fi, stalker,Andrei Tarkovsky,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 13:02:00", "news_title": "Photography Meets Cars", "content": "For more than a century, cars have inspired photographers.

But the technology is sure to improve, and while its creators intend it to be used benignly (for low-bandwidth videoconferencing, for instance), it raises the question: Is this yet another step into an expanding wilderness of fakery and disinformation?\u201cIt\u2019s a great question,\u201d says Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, one of the scientists involved in the work. But she suggests that nefarious uses wouldn\u2019t be easy. The synthesized Obama videos, she notes, were the result of training a computer program using 14 hours of quality video of the former president\u2014chosen precisely because such a video trove is publicly available for a president but for few others. Besides, she says, \u201cwe can identify edited videos created with our technology.\u201dNonetheless, she says, \u201cwe show the results to the wide public to encourage the introduction of rules to how videos can be signed and coded to have a 100% promise that they are real.\u201d We don\u2019t yet know if such guarantees are plausible, but manipulating audio and video is getting easier all the time. Technology developed by researchers at Princeton University and Adobe Systems, for example, make it possible to edit voice recordings on a computer as easily as text, with seamless results when played back. The researchers did this by creating computer software that synthesizes new words in a recorded voice from assembled snippets of partial word sounds from elsewhere in the recording.The University of Washington technology is somewhat analogous: It uses pre-existing video of Mr. Obama to create realistic mouth movements that can be seamlessly grafted onto video of his face. From digesting all those hours of video, the software can determine which facial expressions and mouth movements work. \u201cPeople are particularly sensitive to any areas of your mouth that don\u2019t look realistic,\u201d says Supasorn Suwajanakorn, one of the scientists. \u201cIf you don\u2019t render teeth right or the chin moves at the wrong time, people can spot it right away, and it\u2019s going to look fake.\u201dThe team has often focused on famous faces. In prior research, they constructed a controllable digital model of       Tom Hanks       from a large photo collection and built animated digital 3-D faces of President       George W. Bush,       Prince Charles       and       Arnold Schwarzenegger       for each frame in a video by using input from still photos.Dr. Kemelmacher-Shlizerman says that the ability to generate real-looking video from a person\u2019s speech (or the speech of someone who sounds like him) could free up teleconferencing from bandwidth constraints: One could stream the audio and locally generate matching facial expressions. The technology could also let us \u201cconverse\u201d with historical figures in virtual reality, perhaps in a videogame or a museum exhibit. But it probably won\u2019t stop there. As Dr. Kemelmacher-Shlizerman puts it, \u201cIn the future, video chat tools like Skype or Messenger will enable anyone to collect videos that could be used to train computer models.\u201d\u201cSynthesizing Obama: Learning Lip Sync from Audio,\u201d Supasorn Suwajanakorn, Steven M.

Cubans watch U.S. films?\u201d joked guest curator Carol Wells, executive director of the L.A.\u2013based Center for the Study of Political Graphics. Despite an embargo that has limited distribution of American films on the island, that love has persisted and includes an enduring affection for Charlie Chaplin. His silent comedies were among the first films ever seen by many rural Cubans, thanks to traveling \u201cmobile cinema\u201d units set up soon after the 1959 revolution. The 44-poster exhibition opens with a section devoted to Chaplin.Made by hand on silk-screen presses, Cuban film posters are more akin to fine-art prints than mass-produced U.S. versions, with a visual wit that has long characterized graphic design on the island. Unlike their American counterparts, Cuban posters put less focus on the movie stars and instead playfully hint at plot and theme. A 2009 poster for the 1948 Alfred Hitchcock thriller \u201cRope\u201d positions an ominously thick length of the stuff as a necktie. The poster for Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cThe Shining\u201d depicts a child\u2019s tricycle leaving blood-red tracks in its wake.Several designers have international reputations. One of Eduardo Mu\u00f1os Bachs\u2019s specialties is his inventive use of Chaplin\u2019s head and derby hat. Antonio P\u00e9rez, known as \u00d1iko, created a black-and-white design fantasia surrounding a cherub hefting submachine guns for \u201cThe Godfather.\u201dThe works in \u201cRadical Women: Latin American Art, 1960\u20131985\u201d take on darker subjects. Opening Sept. 15 at the Hammer Museum, the exhibition gathers more than 100 artists from 15 countries to weave a history of experimental art focused on the female body. Much of it was created under harsh political and social conditions.\u201cYou have to think about the coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in Chile, in Peru, in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay\u201d taking place in the era covered by the exhibition, said Andrea Giunta, professor of Latin American art at Buenos Aires University and co-curator of the show. In this context, art-making was a form of political resistance as well as a place to break creative ground.Several artists ferociously depict the violence and repression they experienced.

Ackerley (1968)1. When J.R. Ackerley\u2019s father was close to death, his son tried to tell him that he was gay. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, old boy,\u201d his father said. \u201cI prefer not to know. So long as you enjoyed yourself, that\u2019s the main thing.\u201d On Ackerley senior\u2019s death in 1929, his son discovered that his father had indeed enjoyed himself. He had kept a whole life of his own hidden, which included a mistress and three daughters, girls who knew their father as \u201cUncle Bodger\u201d\u2014a weekend visitor. \u201cThe discovery of my father\u2019s duplicity gave me, I suppose, something of a jolt, not severe to a mind as self-centred as mine, but a jolt which gradually intrigued and then engaged my thought more and more.\u201d This is only one duplicity the author will discover; but for all that, Ackerley\u2019s father comes across as an invincible charmer. \u201cMy Father and Myself\u201d was groundbreaking in its honest portrayal of the author\u2019s homosexuality\u2014a work in which intimacy and distance are elaborately and elegantly layered.By Paul Auster (1982)2. \u2018One day there is life,\u201d Paul Auster writes on the opening page of his debut, \u201cThe Invention of Solitude\u201d; and then one day death arrives, and \u201cthe suddenness of it leaves no room for thought.\u201d In this subtle, questioning memoir the author looks at his father\u2019s life through the prism of his abrupt and final absence; it sets out themes, such as the evasiveness of memory and the strange pull of coincidence, that have preoccupied Mr. Auster throughout his writing life. The father Mr. Auster portrays exists always at one remove: All his son wants to do is impress him. Early on, however, he realizes that he can never bridge the distance between them: \u201cEven if I had done all the things I had hoped to do, his reaction would have been exactly the same.\u201d Mr. Auster\u2019s chance discovery that his grandfather was murdered by his grandmother offers revelation but not explanation. \u201cLanguage is not truth,\u201d Mr. Auster writes. \u201cIt is the way we exist in the world. Playing with words is merely to examine the way the mind functions, to mirror a particle of the world as the mind perceives it.\u201dBy Edmund Gosse (1907)3. Edmund Gosse was one of the great litt\u00e9rateurs of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the champion of Ibsen, Yeats and Joyce. He was raised in the strict Protestant sect known as the Plymouth Brethren, whose members abhor the celebration of Christmas as a pagan ritual. Yet he was raised, too, in love. \u201cFather and Son\u201d is an account of his early life with his father, Philip Gosse, a naturalist who scuppered his own career by attempting to refute the theory of evolution. Gosse\u2019s account of his boyhood is poignant and often hilarious; he tests God\u2019s certain anger at idolatry by saying his daily prayer \u201cin a loud voice, only substituting the address \u2018O Chair!\u2019 for the habitual one.\u201d No thunderbolt results; his faith weakens. Not long after this, his path diverges from that of his father; he discovers poetry. \u201cThere was an extraordinary mixture of comedy and tragedy in the situation which is here described,\u201d Gosse writes, \u201cand those who are affected by the pathos of it will not need to have it explained to them that the comedy was superficial and the tragedy essential.\u201dBy Blake Morrison (1993)4. Blake Morrison\u2019s memoir begins by inviting the reader into one of the zippy convertibles that Arthur Morrison always favored; the family is stuck in traffic on a hot autumn day in 1959, on the way to watch an auto race. Arthur Morrison does not like queues. \u201cA queue, to him, means a man being denied the right to be where he wants to be at a time of his own choosing, which is at the front, now.\u201d And so he steers into the wrong way up the road, past gesticulating drivers, his wife and children mortified in the back. The book shifts between stories of the author\u2019s father that veer between delight and shame and recollections of the weeks before his father\u2019s death. Throughout its author observes, with wisdom and tenderness, how parent and child are entwined. \u201cPatron and protector, he\u2019d been the wall between me and death; now that wall is gone; now I\u2019m on my own.\u201dBy Geoffrey Wolff (1979)5. Both Geoffrey Wolff and his brother, Tobias, turned out to be fine storytellers\u2014Tobias\u2019s memoir \u201cThis Boy\u2019s Life\u201d is a classic of its kind\u2014but perhaps that\u2019s no surprise, given the drama of their childhood. When Rosemary and Arthur Wolff separated, Tobias, the younger son, stayed with his mother. But Geoffrey was left to the mercy of their father. \u201cMy father was a bullshit artist,\u201d Geoffrey Wolff asserts, plainly, in this elegant account of life with a man unable to keep his family afloat on a sea of falsehoods and credit that could finally no longer be sustained. Arthur Wolff claimed to be a Yale man, an aeronautical engineer. He had his shoes and clothes handmade in London; he hid his Jewish ancestry. But in the end\u2014in jail for \u201cbad checks or grand theft or defrauding an innkeeper\u201d\u2014he was \u201cthe wreck of a desperado.\u201d His father, he writes, had been \u201cthe author of his own circumstances, and indifferent to the consequences of this nervy program.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/erica-wagner-1500655227", "keywords": ["bookcar0722,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 12:37:00", "news_title": "The Best New Mysteries", "content": "\u2018Did you know Britain has been voted the loneliness capital of Europe?\u201d asks a character in Susie Steiner\u2019s \u201cPersons Unknown\u201d (Random House, 312 pages, $27), a police procedural as concerned with the mysteries of human hearts as with who stabbed a banker to death at a park in Cambridgeshire. The victim, as it happens, was an in-law of 42-year-old detective Manon Bradshaw, who made her debut in Ms. Steiner\u2019s acclaimed \u201cMissing, Presumed\u201d (2016). And the chief suspect? A 12-year-old boy whom Bradshaw recently adopted. Barred from the official investigation, Bradshaw badgers friends on the force into feeding her information to fuel her own sleuthing.Like its predecessor, \u201cPersons Unknown\u201d is saved from sinking into soap opera by winning prose, sympathetic characters and an appreciation of life\u2019s joys as keen as a knowledge of its dangers. The volatile, opinionated Bradshaw\u2014\u201cmaster of the snap judgment, which often contained a kernel of truth\u201d\u2014needs all the good sense she can muster. She\u2019s not only fighting a cabal of high-rolling hedonists and international thugs but also trying to make peace with a messy world where motives and actions are untidy and happiness, if found, is temporary.When we meet Rowan Petty, the middle-aging con man at the heart of Richard Lange\u2019s riveting, violent caper \u201cThe Smack\u201d (Mulholland, 352 pages, $26), he\u2019s staying at a low-rent casino hotel in Reno, Nev., and down to his last $4,000 in cash. \u201cForty years of fighting gravity,\u201d he thinks to himself, \u201cand what did he have to show for it? A failed marriage, a daughter on dope, and a wallet full of maxed-out credit cards.\u201d At this point, vulnerable Petty is offered a role in a scheme to intercept $2 million being smuggled to Los Angeles from Afghanistan.At first he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s the man for the job: \u201cThat\u2019s not my line. Robbery, rough stuff. I talk chumps out of their money.\u201d But his tempter, a 70-year-old grifter even more desperate than Petty, is persuasive. As Mr. Lange\u2019s semi-likable protagonist sets up shop in L.A., he acquires a companion named Tinafey (\u201clike that white lady on TV,\u201d she explains) and starts to get mixed up with other dodgy urban characters. \u201cThe Smack\u201d is often riveting, thanks to its surreal action scenes, and gradually the path of Petty\u2019s progress becomes ever twistier and more lethal. \u201cHe felt a little noble,\u201d Mr. Lange writes early on; \u201che felt a little doomed.\u201d Time will tell.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of a life that consists merely of counting down the days to the end?\u201d asks Lars Martin Johansson, the 67-year-old former head of Sweden\u2019s National Crime Unit halfway through Leif G.W. Persson\u2019s wonderfully paced \u201cThe Dying Detective\u201d (Pantheon, 426 pages, $27.95). The retired investigator finds himself at a crossroads in the wake of a stroke brought on by yet another ill-advised visit to \u201cthe best hotdog kiosk in Sweden\u201d in pursuit of the perfect Zigeuner sausage with sauerkraut. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop getting stressed, stop worrying and stop getting excited,\u201d one of his new doctors commands. That sounds to the housebound Johansson like a prescription for death by boredom.A solution for his angst is provided by another physician, who points the detective toward a 25-year-old unsolved case: the sexual assault and killing of a 9-year-old girl. \u201cThe Dying Detective\u201d thus proves to be a double police procedural: one in which Johansson revisits the original investigation and another that reveals his own fresh leads and likely suspects. The revivified sleuth never doubts that he\u2019ll catch the culprit. But then what? Through a legal quirk, the case is blocked from prosecution, but Johansson is not about to watch his quarry escape. \u201cWhat had happened was irrevocable,\u201d he concludes. \u201cBut it was still possible to do something about what was yet to come.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-new-mysteries-1500655045", "keywords": ["books,political,general news,child abuse,society,community,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,murder,manslaughter,social issues,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 12:24:00", "news_title": "Subway Car Derails in Brooklyn", "content": "A Q subway train car derailed in Brooklyn on\u00a0Friday\u00a0morning, weeks after a subway car derailment in Manhattan.A Fire Department of New York official said that a pregnant woman was taken to NYU Langone Hospital\u2014Brooklyn complaining of minor back pain.None of the other estimated 135 passengers were injured, according to a Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman.The spokesman said that the second set of wheels on the second car of a southbound Q train traveling between Sheepshead Bay and Brighton Beach came off the rails shortly before\u00a09 a.m. EDT.

It employs about 2,300 across China, and the company said it serves more than 10,000 customers.Reuters reported earlier about Cardinal Health\u2019s plans and that the company had drawn interest from firms willing to pay up to $1.5 billion in a deal.In 2010, Cardinal extended its reach in China when it acquired Zuellig Pharma China, the country\u2019s largest drug importer, for $470 million, including debt. Zuellig had annual sales exceeding $1 billion at the time.If Cardinal does sell the unit, the company would be exiting China\u2019s fast-growing pharmaceuticals market as government regulators look to exert greater oversight of the industry. In February, the Chinese government issued its plans for reform of the industry, including asking state agencies to encourage consolidation of drug manufacturers and distributors, according to an article published by corporate law firm Sidley Austin LLP.A deal could also give Cardinal more leeway to expand its medical-supplies business overseas. In April, Cardinal agreed to acquire             Medtronic                   PLC\u2019s medical-supplies business for $6.1 billion, which it plans to finance with $4.5 billion in new debt.

The State Department said Friday those seeking to travel to North Korea for limited humanitarian or other purposes could apply for an exception by using so-called special validation passports. Otherwise, American passports will be considered invalid for use in traveling to or through North Korea.The ban will take effect in late August, 30 days after the State Department publishes public notice, which Ms. Nauert said will occur next week.The ban was signaled earlier Friday by tour operators. The two largest travel companies involved in taking Western tourists to the isolated country, China-based Koryo Tours and Young Pioneer Tours, said they learned of the impending ban from the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang, which handles U.S. diplomatic affairs in North Korea and had contacted them separately by phone to inform them of the U.S. decision.Officers at both companies said the Swedish Embassy told them the U.S. would make the announcement on Thursday next week. Violating the ban would lead to the U.S. government invalidating the traveler\u2019s passport, Young Pioneer said it was told.Young Pioneer stopped bringing U.S. tourists to North Korea last month following the death of Mr. Warmbier, who went to North Korea in late 2015 on a tour organized by the company.At least three Americans are being held in North Korea, though none was a tourist. Two are tied to a Christian university in Pyongyang. At least 16 American citizens have been detained in North Korea over the past decade, according to the State Department.About 5,000 Western tourists visit North Korea each year, with roughly one-fifth of them U.S. citizens, according to Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, which has been bringing visitors to North Korea since 1993.Tourists visiting North Korea aren\u2019t typically allowed to travel independently and generally join group tours, where they are closely chaperoned by representatives of official state entities.Tourism companies catering to the demands of tourists with less-conventional tastes have sprung up in recent years in the U.S., Europe, China and Australia. Most tours to North Korea last between three days and two weeks and are focused on Pyongyang, though some have included activities such as train travel, skiing and surfing.Mr. Cockerell said Friday that the travel ban would be \u201ca big blow to us,\u201d and it would likely reduce the willingness of other Western nationals to travel to North Korea.U.K.-incorporated Koryo Tours accounts for about 40% of the overall volume of Western tourists to North Korea, he estimates. Mr. Cockerell criticized the U.S. decision.\u201cAll interactions between North Koreans and Americans, who are very much demonized in the country, will grind to a halt, and the North Koreans will only be left with their own media to portray Americans as they like,\u201d he said.Some travelers in the U.S. said they thought a ban would be unfair to Americans curious to learn about the closed society.\u201cI think it\u2019s an overreach on the part of the American government,\u201d said Stacy Stone, 28, of Chattanooga, Tenn., who spent two weeks in North Korea in October, traveling with U.K.-based tour operator Secret Compass. \u201cThey need to allow American citizens to make their own choice.\u201d\u2014Kris Maher contributed to this article.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com and Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. to Ban Tourist Visits to North Korea.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-ban-tourist-visits-to-north-korea-travel-agencies-say-1500627560", "keywords": ["north korea, north korea travel ban, tourism, travel ban, u.s.,U.S. government,political,general news,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,state department"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 11:52:00", "news_title": "What Chimps Understand About Reciprocity", "content": "When someone does something nice for you, do you return the favor? Most of us do, and not just because our mothers said we should.Basic fairness is probably written into our genetic code. Human societies depend on the expectation of reciprocity: We assume that a neighbor will collect our mail if we\u2019ve mowed their lawn, or that drivers will take turns braking at stop signs.Fundamental as this trait might seem, however, its evolutionary origins are hazy. Previous research has shown that chimpanzees\u2014one of our closest relatives\u2014are less motivated by fairness than by what they immediately stand to gain from a transaction.A new study shows that chimps can go beyond such reflexive selfishness and cooperate, even if it costs them something. But they don\u2019t just give up what\u2019s theirs, even to their kin. They are particular about when they will share some of their food, according to research led by University of Vienna biologist       Martin Schmelz       and just published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Like many of us, the team found, chimps keep score: They\u2019re most likely to allot treats to a partner if that chimp helped them first.How do we know this, since chimps can\u2019t discuss their intentions? Dr. Schmelz and his colleagues constructed an apparatus in which two chimps face one another with a cage between them. It contains several bowls of food, which the chimps can\u2019t reach.One chimp can pull on a string, thus lifting a latch that gives the other chimp access to the food in the cage. That chimp then has a decision to make: It can keep a larger portion entirely for itself\u2014with nothing for its partner\u2014or opt for two smaller but equal amounts. The helper chimp had been trained to always pull the string, thus giving its partner access to the bowls of food and the impression of generosity.In these circumstances, the team found, the chimp given access to the bowls usually chose to reward the string-pulling helper chimp with an equal amount. The decider chimp seemed aware that the other chimp had provided a crucial benefit and wanted to reciprocate.In other trials, no string was available to the helper chimp. A human experimenter opened the latch, while the helper chimp rocked on its haunches, apparently powerless. In this case, when the helper chimp wasn\u2019t the one opening the hatch, the decider chimp seemed unconcerned about repaying any debt: Sometimes it allocated food to its partner, other times it didn\u2019t.\u2018The chimps were keeping a mental tally\u2014or, to put it more charitably, showing intuitions of fairness.\u2019The chimps were keeping a mental tally\u2014or, to put it more charitably, showing intuitions of fairness. When the helper chimp opened the latch, the decider chimp \u201cchose the option where they both got food more often,\u201d Dr. Schmelz said. \u201cBut when I opened it, the [decider chimp] chose randomly.\u201dThe study was small: It involved six chimps from the Leipzig Zoo that were more or less related to one another and took turns playing the role of helper and decider. Some of the chimps at the zoo couldn\u2019t master the apparatus and were cut from the experiment. This raises the question of whether reciprocity surfaces only in more intelligent chimps.Moreover, the chimps showed not pure generosity but tit-for-tat reciprocity. \u201cThey didn\u2019t share spontaneously,\u201d Dr. Schmelz noted. \u201cThey only gave a partner food when the partner had assisted them before.\u201dStill, the chimps had the smarts\u2014and the primitive moral sense\u2014to keep track of who just did what for whom, and they were motivated to reward or punish recent past behavior. The results were strikingly consistent, even in a limited sample, and suggest how more nuanced social exchanges in humans might have evolved.We don\u2019t usually expect animals to care about debts to each other. But the chimps\u2019 ability to do just that may tell us something about the universal human capacity to form complex societies based on fairness.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-chimps-understand-about-reciprocity-1500652371", "keywords": ["chimps,evolution,fairness,martin schmelz,mind and matter,reciprocity,sharing,susan pinker,trust,research,development,corporate,industrial news,bowls,petanque,political,general news,sciences,humanities,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 11:50:00", "news_title": "Second Coding Boot Camp Plans to Close as Industry Retrenches ", "content": "Two high-profile coding boot camps have announced plans to close in as many weeks, signaling a shakeout in the fast-growing market that aims to turn liberal-arts graduates and others into entry-level computer programmers.The Iron Yard, a coding boot camp backed by funding from the parent company of University of Phoenix, said Thursday it will shutter after teaching its current cohort of students.

The boot camps, which generally last a few months and cost an average $11,500, had roughly 15,000 students in 2016.\u2018We\u2019re seeing a bit of a shakeout in the industry.\u2019The market report, which was completed before the announced closures of Dev Bootcamp and Iron Yard, tallied 94 boot-camp providers, up from 91 last year, based on 15 new schools opening and seven shutting down.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a bit of a shakeout in the industry,\u201d said       Liz Eggleston,        cofounder of Course Report. She said both Iron Yard and Dev Bootcamp expanded rapidly into new cities, and it can be difficult to get a deep understanding of the hiring networks and employer needs in so many geographies so fast.Still, Ms. Eggleston said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t close because the education model failed. They both still trained a lot of developers, and those developers are doing really good things.\u201dIron Yard said in a statement posted on its website that it decided to close after \u201cconsidering the current environment.\u201dThe school, which will have enrolled more than 3,000 students since launching four years ago, had in-person courses across 15 cities. \u201cWe have faced the same challenges all institutions in higher learning face while forging a new model in a nascent market,\u201d the company said.An Iron Yard spokesman declined to comment beyond the prepared statement.Apollo Education Group Inc. paid $15.9 million for a 62% stake in Iron Yard in 2015.Kaplan bought Dev Bootcamp in 2014 for an undisclosed sum, while             Capella Education Co.       bought Hackbright Academy for $18 million last spring .General Assembly, one of the more comprehensive tech training programs, raised $70 million from investors in 2015 and announced last year it was trimming its staff by 7% to ensure long-term sustainability.Initially pitched as an alternative to traditional colleges, many ended up enrolling college graduates unsatisfied with their liberal-arts degrees.The Education Department last summer announced it would allow students at a handful of alternative education providers, including coding boot camps Epicodus, MakerSquare and the Flatiron School, to access federal student aid funds under an experimental program.Some of the companies have shifted their messaging to pitch their programs as providing training for entry-level jobs, rather than launch pads for successful tech careers. As far back as 2014, they began advising that even superstar students would need additional training to keep up in a fast-changing tech industry.Dev Bootcamp said in a July 12             Facebook                   that the decision to shutter across its six cities was \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d adding that it was \u201cunable to find a sustainable model that doesn\u2019t compromise\u201d on offering high-quality, immersive coding training to a diverse population.Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/second-coding-boot-camp-plans-to-close-as-industry-retrenches-1500652219", "keywords": ["closures,coding bootcamp,course report,Kaplan,University of Phoenix,plans,strategy,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility closures,political,general news,education,educational services,business,consumer services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 11:50:00", "news_title": "Siemens Cuts Russia Presence After Turbines End Up in Crimea", "content": "FRANKFURT\u2014            Siemens AG        SIEGY 0.01%       on Friday announced measures to reduce its presence in Russia, including its exit from joint venture Interautomatika, after four gas turbines delivered by one of the German company\u2019s Russian partners for a power plant project turned up in Russian-occupied Crimea, possibly violating European Union sanctions.The EU imposed sanctions on Russia after its annexation of the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014.Siemens said it hasn\u2019t uncovered any indication that export-control regulations were violated in the matter. But it said it had received credible information that all four gas turbines that the German engineering company delivered last summer for the Taman power plant project in southern Russia have since been diverted to Crimea.The Moscow office of the joint venture Interautomatika did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The redirection constituted a \u201cblatant breach of Siemens\u2019 delivery contracts, trust and EU regulations,\u201d Siemens said.Siemens said it would take several steps to ensure better control of its deliveries to customers in Russia.As one measure, Siemens will sell its minority stake in Interautomatika, which offers products and services for power plant instruments and control systems.Siemens holds a 46% minority stake in Interautomatika, 17% is held by Siemens\u2019 customer Technopromexport and the remaining 37% is held by Russian power research institute VTI.Technopromexport bought the gas turbines from Siemens and commissioned Interautomatika with instrumentation and control of the power plant in Taman.Technopromexport declined to comment on the matter. A press representative for VTI could not be immediately reached.Siemens has said it repeatedly sought assurances from Technopromexport that the turbines would be installed in Taman as agreed, only to find out they ended up in Crimea.Last week, the German government, which is responsible for determining whether the shipment violated EU sanctions, called on Siemens to explain how the turbines got diverted to Crimea.Siemens has sued Technopromexport, a unit of state-owned Rostec State Corp., in Moscow. The legal action aims to stop delivery of other Siemens equipment that might be destined for Crimea and ensure that equipment already dispatched there is returned to Taman, the original destination.Siemens said it would also replace or suspend two Siemens employees representing the German company on Interautomatika\u2019s supervisory board, with immediate effect, while investigating the matter.A Siemens spokesman said the German company will keep the board seats until it is eventually able to pull out of the joint venture, when board representation will become obsolete. This won\u2019t happen immediately, he said.As another measure to prevent any shipping or services that could violate export-control regulation, Siemens said it has initiated steps to end a license agreement with Russian companies involved in equipment supply for combined-cycle power stations.Siemens said it is reviewing all potential collaboration between its subsidiaries and other entities around the world as regards deliveries to Russia.It will halt delivering power-generation equipment to state-controlled clients in Russia under existing contracts for now, Siemens said.Siemens renewed its offer to buy back the turbines that were sent to Crimea and cancel the contract with Technopromexport.Write to Ulrike Dauer at ulrike.dauer@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/siemens-cuts-russia-presence-after-turbines-end-up-in-crimea-1500646891", "keywords": ["European Union,Siemens,SIE.XE,ownership changes,joint ventures,consortia,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,partnerships,collaborations,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,tariffs,trade barriers,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,electricity,gas utilities,computers,consumer electronics,technology,utilities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 11:40:00", "news_title": "The Meaning of \u2018Blockbuster,\u2019 From \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 to Scoops on Trump", "content": "For Hollywood, we\u2019re deep into summer \u201cblockbuster\u201d territory\u2014with big-budget movies like \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d and \u201cWar for the Planet of the Apes\u201d dominating the box office.But the word \u201cblockbuster\u201d keeps appearing elsewhere in current events. It has been used to describe political scandals like the Trump-Russia story, big baseball moves like this week\u2019s seven-player trade between the New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox, and corporate deals like the proposed merger between             AT&T                   and             Time Warner.While anything of great power or size can now be labeled a \u201cblockbuster,\u201d the term\u2019s roots are found in World War II bombing raids. A \u201cblockbuster\u201d was originally an aerial bomb large enough to knock down a block of houses. The term burst into American newspapers on July 25, 1942, when the Associated Press reported on a British Royal Air Force attack on targets in Germany: \u201cAgain the RAF dropped its two-ton \u2018block buster\u2019 bombs.\u201dH.L. Mencken, the journalist and keen observer of American language, included \u201cblockbuster\u201d (along with \u201cblitz,\u201d \u201cevacuee,\u201d \u201cflak\u201d and \u201cparatroops\u201d) in his list of up-and-coming \u201cwar words\u201d in the February 1944 issue of the journal American Speech. Later that year, another American Speech article noted that \u201cblockbuster\u201d had already followed the metaphorical path of \u201cbombshell\u201d before it, for something that packs a devastating impact.Time Magazine in particular enjoyed using \u201cblockbuster\u201d as a hyperbolic way to describe the significance of major political moves. \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court last week dropped a blockbuster on the radio industry,\u201d announced a May 1943 article about a ruling that expanded the powers of the Federal Communications Commission. And in March 1944, reporting on Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley\u2019s decision to withdraw support from President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s wartime tax plan, Time wrote that Barkley \u201chad dropped his political blockbuster.\u201dThe entertainment industry was quick to embrace the term as well. The syndicated Hollywood gossip columnist Erskine Johnson had this to say about the actress Maureen O\u2019Hara in 1950: \u201cGive Maureen the choice between an artistic success and a box-office blockbuster and she\u2019ll take the commodity that keeps the cashiers hopping every time.\u201dSomething with the impact of a \u201cblockbuster\u201d could be called \u201cblockbusting.\u201d That term took on a very different meaning in the housing industry, referring to the practice of persuading white homeowners to sell their properties at a loss, playing on fears that racial minorities were encroaching on their neighborhoods. In the 1960s, federal and state housing laws cracked down on these \u201cblockbusters,\u201d as the profiteering real-estate brokers were known.But the term has made its biggest mark in the movie world, as film studios chase their \u201cblockbusters\u201d every summer. And sometimes blockbusters can go bust: Just look at the             Blockbuster                   chain of stores, which once ruled the video-rental business but went belly up in 2013.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-meaning-of-blockbuster-from-wonder-woman-to-scoops-on-trump-1500651600", "keywords": ["ben zimmer,blockbuster,blockbusters,donald trump,gal gadot,h.l. mencken,russia,spider-man homecoming,war for the planet of the apes,wonder woman,baseball,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,politics,international relations,domestic politics,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 11:30:00", "news_title": "Congrats on Your Newborn! Please Report to \u2018Mom Jail\u2019", "content": "Ye Zhen changed out of her pajamas and into street clothes, tucked a baseball cap over her head and slipped out the door of her room.With her accomplice husband by her side, she walked past the guard posted in the hallway, keeping her head down and taking care to avoid eye contact. Moments later she strolled out into the Shanghai sunshine, a free woman.Ms. Ye had escaped, but not from a jail or prison. She had busted out of a yuezi center, a Chinese facility where new mothers spend a month taking things easy after giving birth.The centers are all the rage among Chinese moms who can afford the $15,000 or so it costs for round-the-clock pampering by nannies, health-care professionals and nutrition specialists. The centers provide a modern spin on the traditional at-home yuezi, when new mothers stay in bed and let others take care of the cooking, cleaning and child care.Confinement is part of the bargain, as centers help mothers avoid the perils and germs of the outside world. The new yuezi centers try to ease the ordeal with posh accommodations rivaling those of high-end hotels. Indeed, some yuezi centers are located on leased floors of luxury hotels.New mothers know before check-in that they won\u2019t be allowed to come and go as they please. Even so, some inmates struggle to stay put for a month.\u201cMy daughter and I got meticulous care, but it was like a well-equipped prison,\u201d said Ms. Ye, 33 years old. \u201cI wanted to behave well so that they would release me earlier.\u201dFood is a common complaint. By long tradition, there are many things women can and can\u2019t do during their month of rest, and what they eat is carefully regulated. Oily and salty foods are out, lest they cause breast-feeding mothers to give newborns indigestion.Ren Xiaojing, a Beijing lawyer, checked herself into a palatial postpartum yuezi in a two-story mansion on the outskirts of the capital after giving birth to her second child. Ms. Ren, 36, says she lost her appetite after being served yet another in a series of bland lunches: steamed carrots, fried pig liver with black sesame oil, wheat buns and fish soup.To Chinese taste buds accustomed to a riot of flavor, it was barely edible. Taking pity, Ms. Ren\u2019s mother brought her salted preserved duck eggs, rich with flavor, to boost her appetite.Lu Xiaolan said she got food cravings halfway into her yuezi in Shanghai. She begged her husband to sneak in             Papa John\u2019s                   pizza topped with sausage and bacon.\u201cI heated it up in a microwave after midnight,\u201d said Ms. Lu, 27, who works for an internet finance company. \u201cIt smelled and tasted so good.\u201dChen Lihui tried to stick to her yuezi meals, worrying that if she ate the wrong food, her baby twins might become allergic to her breast milk. But after days of bland meals, she could stand it no more.She begged friends to sneak in boxes of qingtuan, or dumplings stuffed with fillings such as red bean paste and pork floss, a popular Shanghai street food. Ms. Chen, 31, indulged in qingtuan, but limited herself to that.\u201cSometimes I had cravings, but for the sake of breast-feeding, I didn\u2019t dare to eat whatever I wanted,\u201d said Ms. Chen, who works as a marketing manager in Shanghai.The practice of yuezi is centuries old. By custom, the woman stays at home and is tended to by her mother-in-law, since wives typically move in with their husbands\u2019 families. These guardians of tradition enforce a long list of yuezi don\u2019ts: no showers, no hair-washing, no watching TV, no crying, and no cold food.Sex? Don\u2019t even ask.As an alternative, post-childbirth centers have been popping up all over China in the past several years, spurred in part by Beijing\u2019s decision to end the one-child policy\u2014making large numbers of professionals, entrepreneurs and other women of means eligible for one more go at child bearing.Many of these women live in typically cramped Chinese apartments, where the prospect of a month confined in close quarters with two children, a husband and elders\u00a0is too much to bear.\u201cThe yuezi was even worse than the childbirth,\u201d said Wang Song, 34, an executive at a Beijing energy company, who stayed at home after the birth of her first child. Ms. Wang recalls soaking in sweat as her parents forced her to stay tucked in bed under a mountain of blankets, lest she catch a chill.\u201cMy mom is a retired doctor, but some of her knowledge is outdated,\u201d said Ms. Wang. \u201cMy mother-in-law also has her ideas of what\u2019s good for me. It\u2019s really tiresome just to deal with the relationships.\u201dAfter the birth of her second child, Ms. Wang checked into a Beijing center, where she enjoyed a private room equipped with an air purifier and imported bassinet, attended to round-the-clock by nurses and nannies.Best of all, from Ms. Wang\u2019s point of view: Her relatives went back to their own homes at night.Yuezi center staffers also tend to be a bit more lax on the rules than rock-ribbed mothers-in-law.\u201cWe understand that some new moms would want to watch a movie or go shopping from time to time,\u201d said Wei Hua, an administrator at a Beijing center. \u201cBut we need to know their reasons and then issue an exit permit.\u201dMs. Ye, the Shanghai woman who escaped her yuezi, said she didn\u2019t think the staff would grant her permission to leave. Her reason for going home: She missed her pet poodle, An\u2019An.Thus she found herself stealthily exiting the facility one afternoon, posing as a guest who had been visiting. With her newborn safely tucked away in the center\u2019s nursery, Ms. Ye spent a joyful hour at home playing with An\u2019An. She said she returned before dinner, and no one noticed her absence.Emboldened, Ms. Ye managed to pull off two more yuezi breaks during her monthlong stay. Even that wasn\u2019t enough.An entrepreneur, Ms. Ye had recently launched a clothing design firm and said she couldn\u2019t afford to let the business slide. She began convening staff meetings in her yuezi room with her designer and production chief, who brought in fabric samples to discuss style and production matters.\u201cSeeing my staff come and go, the nanny was dumbfounded,\u201d Ms. Ye recalled. \u201cShe tried to convince me to rest more, but eventually gave up.\u201d\u2014Fanfan Wang in BeijingAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/congrats-on-your-newborn-please-report-to-mom-jail-1500651015", "keywords": ["china babies,newborns,new mothers,page-one stories"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 11:29:00", "news_title": "Blackstone and CVC Ready to Bet on Risky Side of Payments", "content": "Private equity groups             Blackstone        BX -0.17%       and CVC are looking to join the payments party with a preliminary near-$4 billion offer for U.K.-listed         Paysafe,       the company revealed Friday. It looks like a gamble Paysafe shareholders should welcome.Bid activity is rife in the sector right now: Just this month, the U.K.\u2019s             Worldpay        WPG 0.32%agreed to a $10 billion takeover by             Vantiv,        VNTV -0.17%       a U.S. rival, while an unnamed bidder also approached Danish group             Nets        NETS 0.80%       A/S. The growth of online commerce, card and digital payments over cash, as well as regulatory change in Europe, are all driving interest.Paysafe is different from other payments groups because it has a taste for the riskier end of the business. It has large exposures to processing payments for online gambling as well as gaming, auction sites and dating services.Online gambling is subject to uncertain regulation in a number of countries, especially in Asia where Paysafe conducts about one-quarter of its business. The joint-bid from Blackstone and CVC is conditional on Paysafe selling part of its Asian operations, for which the private equity groups have a potential buyer lined up.Paysafe was already aiming to dilute its Asian exposure. In line with that it also said Friday it will buy Houston, Texas-based payment processor Merchants\u2019 Choice Payment Solutions for $470 million.The extra debt to fund that deal would lift Paysafe\u2019s enterprise value to $4.3 billion if the Blackstone and CVC offer goes ahead.The two firms are bidding together because the size of the equity check at about $2 billion would be too much for either group alone. Also, CVC has experience in the area: it previously owned an electronic wallet business called Skrill that it sold to Paysafe in 2015, plus it has gambling investments in Italy and Germany.The preliminary offer values Paysafe at 20-times forecast earnings for this year and the price at \u00a35.90-per-share is well above where its shares have traded in recent years. That valuation is a long way behind the 38-times earnings that Vantiv\u2019s offer for Worldpay is currently worth, but investor perception of regulatory risk around Paysafe means it has long traded at a discount.This private equity bid is preliminary, and might not ultimately materialize, but it looks decent value for Paysafe investors if it does.Write to Paul J.

But with today\u2019s family life looking more like a town hall meeting than the mini-monarchies of the past, parents need to be wary of giving children too much sway.\u201cModern parents want their kids to feel included and empowered, so nearly every purchase is now a family decision,\u201d says branding strategist Bill Goodwin. In a recent National Retail Federation survey of more than 1,000 parents of Gen Zers (the generation born after 1995), 67% said that they solicit their child\u2019s opinion before making family purchases, and 59% said that they won\u2019t buy something if their child doesn\u2019t approve of it.Those purchases can be significant. A few years ago, New York-based real-estate agent Lisa Larson was helping a young family search for a new apartment. They found one, she says, but wouldn\u2019t complete the deal until they brought in their daughter for her stamp of approval. The daughter was 6.Children and teens influence\u2014and often dominate\u2014family leisure time, too. Weekends, for example, were once reserved for helping parents with chores. Today, many parents spend their days shuttling kids to soccer games or sitting through all-day chess tournaments.\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of one of the greatest social experiments of our time,\u201d says psychologist Richard Weissbourd of the Harvard Graduate School of Education. More than any other generation, we are trying to be closer to our kids, listen to them and value their opinions. There are great benefits, says Dr. Weissbourd, \u201cbut it\u2019s also a more challenging kind of parenting.\u201dThere are many decisions that parents can be democratic about, such as picking a restaurant. But when it comes to making major purchases (such as a house) or determining family priorities (such as deciding whether to travel to see extended family or go to Disneyland), he says that a parent\u2019s wisdom should prevail. When in doubt, parents can ask themselves: What is my motivation behind letting my child make or influence this decision?\u201cThere is a big difference between being close to your children and being their best friend, and some parents have a hard time finding that line,\u201d says Dr. Weissbourd. He points to surveys that reveal that parents are spending more time with their children than ever before, while at the same time maintaining fewer social ties and friendships than in the past. He says, \u201cUnfortunately, some parents now rely on their kids to fill the void of where a friend should be.\u201dWhen parents become too dependent on their children for closeness, he says, it can undercut an important part of a child\u2019s moral development, what psychologists refer to as \u201cidealization\u201d\u2014the process by which a child puts their parent on a pedestal for a period of time, idealizes them and internalizes the parent\u2019s values, morals and ideals. \u201cChildren have no incentive to strive to become like us when we treat them as equals and send them the signal that they already are,\u201d he says.Children need to be taught to make sacrifices and not to assume that others will organize their lives around them, which can lead to entitlement, says Dr. Weissbourd. For example, if Saturdays are spent engaging in a child\u2019s activity, then on Sundays, bring your child on family errands. Also, be clear with your children about which decisions are democratic and which ones aren\u2019t. If a decision is being made jointly, define the rules of the negotiations, such as limiting a discussion to five minutes and then taking a vote.It\u2019s important for parents to allow children and teens to make some decisions, particularly when it involves their own time (like which sports they\u2019ll play) or purchases (like their clothes), says New York psychologist Laura Markham, author of \u201cPeaceful Parent, Happy Kids.\u201d But it\u2019s the parent\u2019s job to set limits. For older children, that might mean setting a budget. Younger children can be overwhelmed by too many choices, so you may want to limit their decisions to only two options.Empowering children to make decisions about their own lives teaches them valuable life skills, such as how to take responsibility for themselves. However, when it comes to decisions that affect the overall family, Dr. Markham says, \u201cParents should have the last word.\u201d\u2014Ms. Wallace is a freelance writer in New York.Appeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'CHILDREN should be heard, but only so much.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/children-should-be-heard-but-only-so-much-1500650055", "keywords": ["children's influence,families,more on parenting,parenting,parenting advice,parenting tips,National Retail Federation"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 11:00:00", "news_title": "Lyft Shifts Gears With New Driverless-Car Division", "content": "When Uber Technologies Inc. embarked on a costly mission to develop self-driving vehicles, ride-hailing competitor Lyft Inc. set a different course, relying on partnerships for what many believe is the future of urban transportation.Now Lyft is raising the ante at a vulnerable time for its rival.The San Francisco company on Friday said it is forming its own autonomous-car development division, to be staffed by hundreds of engineers and technicians at a new office in the heart of Silicon Valley. Lyft said it would be developing its own software and hardware to enable vehicles\u00a0to maneuver without a human at the wheel, while the company also works to attract new partners that can plug their own self-driving cars into its grid.\u201cWe want to take a proactive role into pushing the industry into a more open environment,\u201d       Raj Kapoor,        Lyft\u2019s chief strategy officer said, at a media event. \u201cThe only way to do that is to go deeper and to develop these technologies.\u201dThe new division marks a shift for Lyft, which had favored partnerships with self-driving vehicle developers including Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo, NuTonomy Inc.,             General Motors Co.        GM 0.14%       and             Tata Motors Ltd.\u2019s       Jaguar Land Rover. While Lyft has kept many details of those deals under wraps, it had signaled it would leave the development of those cars and underlying technology to the manufacturers, which promised to provide the vehicles to Lyft\u2019s network in the coming years. Later this year, NuTonomy and GM plan to test their cars on Lyft\u2019s network.Lyft executives insist their efforts to develop driverless cars won\u2019t conflict with those partnerships.\u00a0\u201cThis isn\u2019t about bringing one car or two cars or a hundred cars onto the streets of San Francisco\u2014this is about bringing hundreds of thousands of cars\u201d to Lyft\u2019s network, Mr. Kapoor said.But the move indicates Lyft is hedging its\u00a0bets as an increasing array of tech companies and auto makers jockey for position as the multi-trillion-dollar U.S. automotive industry evolves.\u00a0Many technologists see autonomous vehicles saving lives by reducing human error and lowering the costs of transportation, but it isn\u2019t clear who will own the cars or how they will be managed and operated. Self-driving technology is still unproven and will take years to perfect and to receive regulatory approval.\u201cWhile these players started a long time ago, the technology has evolved since then,\u201d said       Luc Vincent,        Lyft\u2019s vice president of engineering. \u201cWe can build on the current technology and move faster.\u201dAs Lyft plants its flag, Uber\u2019s self-driving operation is reeling after the company fired the division\u2019s head in the wake of a lawsuit from Waymo that alleges the ride-hailing company conspired with the executive, Anthony Levandowski, to steal design secrets. Uber, which denies the allegations, has sought to be a leader in self-driving cars, rolling out tests in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Tempe, Ariz.Lyft is opening a new office in Palo Alto, Calif., in a building once used by video-calling company Skype, and hopes that base will help it attract engineering talent, said Director of Product Taggart Matthiesen. He said the company plans to hire \u201chundreds\u201d for the new division; Uber has nearly 700 working on self-driving cars in Pittsburgh alone.Lyft\u2019s executives said getting driverless vehicles on the road is important for lowering customers\u2019 costs, in part because it won\u2019t have to pay human drivers 75% or more of a fare. The company said details like how it will share revenue with manufacturers are yet to be determined.\u201cWe think we can get more people using transportation as a service and less car ownership if we move in the direction of self-driving,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said.Write to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Lyft Jumps Into Driverless.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyft-shifts-gears-with-new-driverless-car-division-1500649200", "keywords": ["autonomous,driverless,self-driving,silicon valley,vc industry news,Uber Technologies,Lyft,Alphabet Cl C,GOOG,nuTonomy,Waymo,General Motors,GM,Tata Motors,IN:EQTATAMOTORS,Anthony Levandowski,Taggart Matthiesen,Luc Vincent,Raj Kapoor,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,retail,wholesale,etailing,internet search engines,autonomous driving technologies,automotive,computing,e-commerce,online service providers,technology,sharing economy services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 10:54:00", "news_title": "A New Deal in Card Games", "content": "A simple deck of playing cards is incredibly versatile. With just 52 cards divided into four suits of 13 ordered ranks, you can play a seemingly infinite variety of games\u2014without even adding the jokers, which figure mainly in \u201chouse rules\u201d variants of standard games. Amazingly, considering the simplicity of the equipment, hundreds of those games are actually fun. David Parlett\u2019s \u201cPenguin Book of Card Games\u201d details about 250 of them, divided into 24 categories, from familiar favorites like Bridge and Hearts to more obscure games like Grevjass and Six-bid.These games generally encompass a limited set of actions. They often proceed with the cards being dealt and drawn from the deck, combined in sets, and passed or discarded. Sometimes bets are made or money awarded. Gin Rummy is a perfect example: Players get 10 cards each, then must take turns drawing and discarding until one of them has enough cards in \u201cmelds\u201d of the same rank or in sequences within a suit. That player then shows his hand, and the points are tallied.Modern card games have broken out of this confined space of possibilities by introducing new sets of cards and new ways of using them. One of the best new mechanisms is drafting, which emerged gradually in recent decades and then became well-known as the central element of the popular 2012 game 7 Wonders, in which players compete to develop the most powerful ancient civilization.With traditional dealing or drawing, players don\u2019t know which cards they will receive. In drafting games, the players see a set of cards and choose which of them they want for their hand. The ability to make a choice adds elements of skill and strategy: One\u2019s choices may be good or bad, and by removing cards from a common pool, players can alter the choices available to opponents who draft after they do.Bruno Faidutti\u2019s classic game Citadels, introduced in 2000 and rereleased last year in its fourth edition, uses a simple form of drafting. Players attempt to be the first to erect eight new districts in their city. The game has two types of cards: district and character cards. To start each round of the game, each player gets to choose a character from the set; their choice determines what actions they may take that round. The warlord gets to destroy an enemy building, the merchant gets to build at lower costs, and so on. Only one player per round may choose each identity. If you get first pick in the draft, you can choose any role, but if you pick last, you will probably miss out on the ones you wanted.Elegant in its simplicity, Citadels is a good introduction to modern card games. It may whet the appetite for Dominion, the first hit by game designer Donald X. Vaccarino. Dominion won the prestigious German Spiel des Jahres competition in 2009, largely because of its novel \u201cdeck-building\u201d mechanism.In deck-building games, each player has his own deck, unlike in traditional games. Like traditional games, decks are shuffled and cards are drawn randomly from them. In Dominion, players are monarchs trying to expand their kingdoms using an assortment of cards, including treasure, curse and action cards. As the game goes on, players make decisions that add more cards to their decks from common piles (from a total of 500 that are in play). By building decks with combinations of cards that can work together, Dominion players gradually earn victory points. The game ends when there are no longer enough common cards to continue play.The database at the Board Game Geek website now lists hundreds of drafting and deck-building games. Star Realms from 2014 is a popular two-player game in which players build decks of spaceship combat capabilities to deploy in battle against each other. Sushi Go! from 2013 lets children draft cards to create the best sushi dishes they can.Like all good game mechanics, drafting and deck-building can be applied to almost any theme. And they illustrate the rapid evolution in game design that has happened in the 21st century. By combining the best aspects of modern Eurogames and traditional card games, they create a compelling new experience for players who don\u2019t need boards and pieces to play.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-deal-in-card-games-1500648851", "keywords": [" card games, citadels, dominion,games, modern card games"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 10:40:00", "news_title": "The Euro May Be Rising, But Money Is Still Easy", "content": "Let battle commence. On one side is the European Central Bank, which is seeking to preserve the benefits for the economy of its monetary-policy settings. On the other side are financial markets, eyeing an exit from ultraloose policy and led by a surging euro.ECB President       Mario Draghi       said Thursday that the euro\u2019s gains had \u201creceived some attention\u201d on the ECB Governing Council. That statement wasn\u2019t enough to stop the currency from rising to its highest level against the dollar since January 2015. That is a problem for the ECB since a rising euro would tend to weigh on inflation, and ultimately might start to raise concerns about competitiveness and growth.But the euro isn\u2019t the only factor that counts. A financial-conditions index constructed by Nomura shows that the backdrop for the eurozone economy has remained supportive even as the euro has appreciated. That reflects factors such as buoyant credit markets, a steeper yield curve and stronger bank stocks, which offset the currency effect.Importantly, receding political risk has reduced the risk of turmoil for more highly-indebted sovereigns in the eurozone, potentially a much bigger headache for the ECB than the currency. The gap between 10-year Italian and German bond yields has contracted by some 0.5 percentage point in the past three months, and is unchanged since the start of the year. Euro-denominated corporate-bond spreads have tightened in 2017. Large companies have easy access to historically cheap borrowing.Meanwhile, the rise in government-bond yields has mostly been at long-dated maturities, leading to a steeper yield curve. That should be good news for banks, a key conduit for financing in the eurozone: the Euro Stoxx Banks index is up 12.5% this year and close to 70% off its 2016 low. Credit standards and conditions have been easing. That might support investment, providing further underpinning for the economy.The reasons for the euro\u2019s rise are important too. The stronger currency largely reflects the improvement in the eurozone economy. The dollar peaked on a rush of optimism about the U.S. outlook that has faded; meanwhile Europe has steadily outperformed expectations. A weaker dollar also tends to ease global conditions, particularly for emerging markets\u2014something that Europe should benefit from.The euro will command a lot of attention, and rightly so. But if credit-market conditions in particular remain supportive, the ECB\u2019s task looks more manageable.Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-euro-may-be-rising-but-money-is-still-easy-1500648031", "keywords": ["central banks,currency,currency trading,euro,euro levels,european central bank,euro prices,government debt,heard on the street,euro zone,economic news,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 10:30:00", "news_title": "Founder of Purdue Pharma Made a Fortune From Addictive Painkiller OxyContin, Donated Generously to Charity", "content": "When       Raymond Sackler       and his brother bought and began running the company now known as Purdue Pharma LP in the 1950s, it was a small New York City pharmaceutical firm selling laxatives, earwax remover and an arthritis treatment.By the 1990s the brothers built Purdue into a large, family-owned enterprise best known for another product: OxyContin, a powerful opioid painkiller that caused widespread addiction after hitting the U.S. market in 1996.Dr. Sackler, who was president of Purdue from 1991 until 1999 and served on its board until his death on Monday, leaves a legacy of controversy involving OxyContin but also a history of charitable giving to some of the world\u2019s best known museums and universities. As Dr. Sackler won praise for his philanthropy and even a British knighthood, reports of OxyContin abuse and addiction mounted, alongside allegations that Purdue was improperly playing down the drug\u2019s risks in its marketing.In 2007, a federal investigation of Purdue led the company and three of its executives to plead guilty in federal court in Virginia to criminal charges of misleading the public about OxyContin\u2019s addiction risks between 1995 and 2001, and to pay $634.5 million in government penalties and costs to settle civil litigation.Dr. Sackler wasn\u2019t charged with wrongdoing, and left little record of publicly commenting on the OxyContin crisis.He died in Greenwich, Conn., after a brief illness, at the age of 97.Raymond Raphael Sackler was born Feb. 16, 1920, in Brooklyn, N.Y., the son of grocers, according to Purdue. He attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn and then New York University, receiving a bachelor of science degree in 1938. He began studying for a medical degree in Glasgow, Scotland, where he volunteered as a plane spotter in the U.K. home guard in the early years of World War II. He completed his medical degree in 1944 at Middlesex University School of Medicine in Massachusetts and was certified as a psychiatrist.In his early professional years, Dr. Sackler conducted research in the then relatively new field of psychopharmacology, or the use of medication to treat mental disorders, according to Purdue.In 1952 Dr. Sackler and his brother, Mortimer, purchased The Purdue Frederick Co. and moved its offices to Greenwich Village in New York City. According to a book about OxyContin by the journalist       Barry Meier,        \u201cPain Killer: A \u2018Wonder\u2019 Drug\u2019s Trail of Addiction and Death,\u201d Raymond and Mortimer\u2019s older brother, Arthur, financed that acquisition and \u201clet his brothers run it.\u201dBy the 1970s, the brothers\u2019 pharmaceutical business had expanded overseas, with Mortimer running the European operation and Raymond \u201cmost closely associated\u201d with Purdue\u2019s U.S. business, according to the book. Arthur and Mortimer died in 1987 and 2010, respectively.Purdue got an early start in opioid pain treatment in the 1980s, when it began selling MS Contin, a new formulation of morphine, in the U.S. The so-called extended-release tablet was designed to release morphine into the body slowly over time, requiring fewer doses a day.OxyContin was a similar extended-release formulation of the opioid painkiller oxycodone. According to Mr. Meier\u2019s book, Purdue dramatically expanded its sales force to market OxyContin to doctors, nearly doubling its size by 1998. In its 2007 guilty plea in federal court, Purdue admitted the company\u2019s sales tactics included falsely claiming that OxyContin was less addictive, less subject to abuse and less likely to cause withdrawal symptoms than other pain medications. Within a few years of the drug\u2019s launch, many communities around the country started reporting worrying rates of OxyContin-related abuse and overdose deaths.Purdue\u2019s website today says the company has \u201clearned from the past\u201d and notes that Purdue supports various programs to prevent prescription-drug abuse.Dr. Sackler\u2019s son, Richard, took over as Purdue\u2019s president in 1999, while Dr. Sackler continued to serve on the board. Last year Forbes ranked the extended Sackler clan as the 19th richest family in the U.S., estimating that 20 family members shared a fortune of $13 billion.Raymond and Beverly Sackler\u2019s philanthropy includes gifts to many prominent museums, including the British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where a gallery of Assyrian art bears their name. Many universities also benefited from their charity, including Rockefeller University in New York; California Institute of Technology; University of California, Berkeley; Cambridge University; and Yale, where the couple financed an institute for biological, physical and engineering sciences.Phillip Sharp, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who became friends with Dr. Sackler after meeting him at a lecture at Cambridge University in the 1990s, describes him as a \u201cvery generous man\u201d with a passion for science. He had a particular interest in and charitable commitment to convergence research, which fosters the integration of multiple fields to try to solve scientific challenges.Coming from the pharmaceutical business, Dr. Sackler was deeply involved in everything from biology and chemistry to the manufacturing and engineering needed to run a factory, Dr. Sharp said. \u201cSo he understood that integrated world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he understood what was going on in modern biological science.\u201dDr. Sackler was also a keen opera buff, often inviting friends to dinner and performances in New York, Dr. Sharp said. When he last saw Dr. Sackler earlier this year, his friend was still going to the office a couple of hours every day, Dr. Sharp says.Dr. Sackler is survived by his wife, Beverly, and sons Richard and Jonathan.Write to Jeanne Whalen at jeanne.whalen@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/founder-of-purdue-pharma-made-a-fortune-from-addictive-painkiller-oxycontin-donated-generously-to-charity-1500647400", "keywords": ["drug addiction,drug news,medicine news,obituaries,opioid crisis,oxycodone,oxycontin,painkillers,purdue pharma,raymond sackler,Purdue Pharma,Raymond Sackler,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,drug,substance usage,behavioral addictions,obsessions,political,general news,society,community,health,medication abuse,misuse,medical conditions,mental disorders,social issues,routine general news,pharmaceuticals,over-the-counter drugs,analgesics,health care,life sciences,specialized drugs,medications"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 10:30:00", "news_title": "Carl Reichardt, as CEO of Wells Fargo, Declared War on Costs Large and Small", "content": "As chief executive of             Wells Fargo                   & Co.,       Carl Reichardt       said he thought of himself \u201cnot as a banker but as a businessman who happens to be running a bank.\u201dThe typical banker, he said in a 1994 interview with the Los Angeles Times, \u201chas the mind-set of a civil servant, in terms of cost control and having a guaranteed income for life.\u201dNot for him were other bankers\u2019 palatial offices or private-jet jaunts to mingle with princes and pop stars.Mr. Reichardt, CEO from 1983 to 1994, declared war on costs in ways big and small. He sold the corporate jet and at one meeting demanded to know why it was necessary to put the documents being discussed into ring binders when paper clips would do. He banished potted plants and underperforming employees.After pulling the bank out of Latin American lending and other overseas entanglements, Mr. Reichardt focused on California, which he called \u201cthe best banking market in the world.\u201d When he retired at the end of 1994, the bank calculated that its total returns to shareholders during his reign had been more than four times the S&P 500 average.             Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway                   became a major shareholder on his watch.Colleagues said Mr. Reichardt excelled at assessing credit risks. It helped that he got up early\u2014often after sleeping only five hours or so. Though he could be gruff, underlings knew where they stood.Mr. Reichardt died July 13 of what his family said was a long illness. He was 86.Carl Edwin Reichardt was born July 6, 1931, in Houston, where his father worked as a hotel manager. By age 12, Carl was working in a lumber yard. He enlisted in the Navy during the Korean War and was stationed in Long Beach, Calif., then earned an economics degree at the University of Southern California.One of his early banking jobs was at Union Bank of California, headed by       Harry J. Volk.       \u2019\u2019Harry called me in one day,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Reichardt said in a 1989 interview with the             New York Times,       \u2019\u2019and he told me, \u2018Carl, you may be a great banker, but you\u2019ve got to learn to sell.\u2019 Most bankers had the idea, you sit there and customers come in and you sort of judge them. Harry said that was all wrong, that you had to go out and drag them in.\u201dIn 1970, he joined Wells Fargo, where he rose to president in 1979 and CEO in 1983. The bank\u2019s 1986 acquisition of Crocker National Corp. for $1.1 billion was a chance to slash costs by eliminating overlaps.Heavy lending to commercial real-estate companies led to a plunge in profit in the early 1990s when California\u2019s property market tanked. The bank survived that storm, and analysts said it had been more careful than many rivals in sizing up loan risks.On weekends, Mr. Reichardt brought work home in a cardboard box that he called \u201cmy Gucci.\u201d During the energy crisis of the 1970s, he urged his children to switch off lights promptly and promised to share with them any savings in the electric bill.Mr. Reichardt yearned to take over another California bank,             First Interstate                   Bancorp, but executives there rebuffed him. \u201cI was out there on the dance floor with my rouge on, but nobody came out,\u201d he said in a 1994 interview.In 1996, after he retired, Wells Fargo finally acquired First Interstate in a hostile takeover, then struggled to combine the two operations, losing some customers annoyed by poor service during the integration. In 1998, a bruised Wells Fargo merged with Norwest Corp.Some of Mr. Reichardt\u2019s imprint remains.       Tim Sloan,        Wells Fargo\u2019s current CEO, said his office still contains some of the \u201csame ratty chairs\u201d that were there in the early 1990s. \u201cWhen we talk about changing furniture, I think, if Carl was here, he\u2019d be fine with\u201d the old furnishings, said Mr. Sloan.Mr. Reichardt\u2019s retirement was interrupted in 2001 when he became vice chairman of Ford Motor Co., where he spent about two years helping to sort out the auto maker\u2019s consumer-credit business.In his spare time, he read about history.

As lawsuits erupted, the hamburger chain\u2014whose unfortunately timed ad campaign touted one burger as \u201cso good it\u2019s scary\u201d\u2014had its own near-death experience.Jack in the Box hired       David Theno,        a food-safety consultant, to devise safer procedures for buying, cooking and serving hamburgers and other items. He stayed at the company for more than 15 years and established a national reputation for food-safety expertise. He later headed the\u00a0food safety and quality department at the Subway restaurant chain.In his briefcase, Dr. Theno carried a picture of Lauren Rudolph, who died at age 6 from the Jack in the Box contamination. The picture reminded him how much was at stake.Senior executives at food and restaurant companies could recite all kinds of statistics about sales and efficiency but often had only a vague idea how they were doing on food safety, Dr. Theno said.

His father was an executive at a manufacturing company. Young David, who grew to 6 feet 6 inches, was on his high-school basketball and cross-country teams and played the cornet and French horn. At Iowa State University, he earned a degree in zoology and science journalism.He had aimed to become a veterinarian but at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign became interested in the science of meat processing. In 1975, he was awarded a doctoral degree in animal science there.After graduating, he helped manage food-safety programs at companies including Armour Food Co.,             Kellogg Co.       and Foster Farms, a chicken producer. Dr. Theno set up his own consulting firm in 1986. That meant he was available when Jack in the Box needed urgent help in 1993.At the hamburger chain, he and colleagues looked for contamination risks at each link in the chain from raw materials to food manufacturing, distribution and restaurant operations. Employees could no longer handle raw meat with bare hands, and each hamburger patty was examined to ensure thorough cooking. Employees learned to wash hands at least once an hour.Dr. Theno was good at explaining why new practices were important and at making employees enthusiastic about the changes, said Darren Blass, the company\u2019s current director of food safety. \u201cDave\u2019s my hero,\u201d Mr. Blass said.In recent years, Dr. Theno operated a consulting firm called Gray Dog Partners, named for his Weimaraner dog.Along with dogs, he owned cats, horses and even a bison.

In all of Spring Hill, four firms\u2014American Homes,             Colony Starwood Homes,        SFR 0.49%       Progress Residential and Streetlane Homes\u2014own nearly 700 houses, according to tax rolls. That amounts to about 5% of all the houses in town, a 2016 census indicates, and roughly three-quarters of those available for rent, according to       Lisa Wurth,        president of the local Realtors\u2019 association.Those four companies and others like them have become big landlords in other Nashville suburbs, and in neighborhoods outside Atlanta, Phoenix and a couple dozen other metropolitan areas. All told, big investors have spent some $40 billion buying about 200,000 houses, renovating them and building rental-management businesses, estimates real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors LLC. Still, they own less than 2% of all U.S. rental homes, according to Green Street.The buying spree amounts to a huge bet that the homeownership rate, which currently is hovering around a five-decade low, will stay low and that rents will continue to rise. The investors also are wagering that many people no longer see owning a home as an essential part of the American dream.\u201cThe rental stigma has really subsided,\u201d says       Michael Cook,        operations chief at closely held Streetlane Homes, which owns about 4,000 houses. \u201cPeople are realizing that houses are not necessarily the best places to store wealth.\u201dFor many years, the rental-home business was dominated by small businesses and mom-and-pop investors, most of whom owned just a property or two. Big investment firms concentrated on other real-estate sectors\u2014apartment buildings, office towers, shopping centers and warehouses\u2014reasoning that single-family homes were too difficult to acquire en masse and unwieldy to manage and maintain.That all began to change during the financial crisis a decade ago. Swaths of suburbia were sold on courthouse steps after millions of Americans defaulted on mortgages. Veteran real-estate investors raced to buy tens of thousands of deeply discounted houses, often sight unseen. The big buyers included investors       Thomas Barrack Jr.       and       Barry Sternlicht      \u2014who later merged their rental-home holdings to create Colony Starwood\u2014            Blackstone Group                   LP, the world\u2019s largest private-equity firm, and self-storage magnate       B.

She had been on the Stanford faculty since 2008.Much of her work involved \u201cdescribing the geometric and dynamic complexities of curved surfaces\u2014spheres, doughnut shapes and even amoebas\u2014in as great detail as possible,\u201d according to a tribute released by Stanford. Though her work was in the ethereal reaches of theory, it could eventually have more earthly applications in engineering and material science, among other things, the Stanford article said.As a child in Tehran, she preferred literature. \u201cI was more excited about reading novels and I thought I would become a writer one day,\u201d she said in a video interview a few years ago. Later, she decided math was a challenge, then \u201crealized that it\u2019s really nice and I enjoy it.\u201dDr. Mirzakhani died of cancer July 14. She was 40.\u201cShe was pretty unassuming,\u201d said Jordan Ellenberg, a professor of math at the University of Wisconsin and author of \u201cHow Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking.\u201d He added: \u201cShe didn\u2019t comport herself as the star that she was.\u201dDr. Mirzakhani was born May 12, 1977. While still a teenager, she began gaining international notice when she competed with the Iranian team in the International Mathematical Olympiad and won gold medals in 1994 and 1995. She got a degree from Sharif University of Technology in Iran before enrolling in Harvard.\u201cShe was drawn to the most difficult challenges in mathematics,\u201d said       Curtis McMullen,        a Harvard professor who guided her doctoral studies. Like many young mathematicians, she excelled at solving problems, he said, but she was also good at formulating new questions to be investigated. He called that \u201cthe hallmark of a promising researcher.\u201dShe once described her research as \u201clike being lost in a jungle and trying to use all the knowledge that you can gather to come up with some new tricks, and with some luck you might find a way out.\u201dOne type of problem she studied was the dynamics of a billiard ball zigzagging inside a polygon. She tried to determine, for instance, how many ways the ball could be shot so that it came back to where it started.In a 2014 article, Dr. Ellenberg explained the allure of billiards: \u201cMathematicians care about this stuff not so much because we like sharking at the pool hall, but because billiards on a flat table\u2026is a pretty decent model for the physics of a gas, each molecule a tiny hard ball whizzing around and bouncing off its fellows.\u201dThings quickly got more complicated. \u201cShe considers not just one billiard table, but the universe of all possible billiard tables,\u201d Dr. Ellenberg wrote, and she looked at how those tables might change shapes. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the kind of thing you do to win at pool, but it\u2019s the kind of thing you do to win a Fields Medal,\u201d he wrote.Dr. Mirzakhani had been battling breast and other cancers since 2013.

Are we doomed to a future in which hordes of desperate job seekers compete for ever-scarcer work, while a handful of owners grow rich on the labors of their mechanical servants? Will robots \u201cdo everything better than us,\u201d as       Elon Musk       warned at last week\u2019s meeting of the National Governors Association?Notable commentators ringing the alarm include Carl Frey and Michael Osborne of the Oxford Martin School, who estimate in a 2013 paper that 47% of all U.S. jobs are at high risk of falling to computerization in the next few decades. In a report published this year,       James Manyika,       Michael Chui       and colleagues at the McKinsey Global Institute offer a more refined view of the changes ahead. They repeated the Frey-Osborne analysis but focused on the potential of artificial intelligence to automate not jobs but discrete tasks (since we use robots for specific activities, not to fill jobs). They project that, by 2055, more than 50% of all work-related tasks will be subject to automation.Such studies naturally raise concerns that we may be on the brink of an unprecedented employment crisis. But robots aren\u2019t mechanical people. They are a new wave of automation, and like previous waves, they reduce the need for human labor. In doing so, they make the remaining workers more productive and their companies more profitable. These profits then find their way into the pockets of employees, stockholders and consumers (through lower prices).This newfound wealth, in turn, increases demand for products and services, compensating for lost jobs by employing even more people. In a recent paper prepared for a European Central Bank conference, the economists David Autor of MIT and Anna Salomons of Utrecht University looked at data for 19 countries from 1970 to 2007. While acknowledging that advances in technology may hurt employment in some industries, they concluded that \u201ccountry-level employment generally grows as aggregate productivity rises.\u201dThe historical record provides strong support for this view. After all, despite centuries of progress in automation and recurrent warnings of a jobless future, total employment has continued to increase relentlessly, even with bumps along the way.More remarkable is the fact that today\u2019s most dire projections of jobs lost to automation fall short of historical norms. A recent analysis by       Robert Atkinson       and John Wu of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation quantified the rate of job destruction (and creation) in each decade since 1850, based on census data. They found that an incredible 57% of the jobs that workers did in 1960 no longer exist today (adjusted for the size of the workforce).Workers suffering some of the largest losses included office clerks, secretaries and telephone operators. They found similar levels of displacement in the decades after the introduction of railroads and the automobile. Who is old enough to remember bowling alley pin-setters? Elevator operators? Gas jockeys? When was the last time you heard a manager say, \u201cTake a memo\u201d?In the face of such evidence, why do so many experts and futurists continue to warn of an impending crisis? The crux of their argument is that the coming wave of artificially intelligent computers and robots can do virtually any job that a human can do, so everyone\u2019s job is on the chopping block. As the logic goes, if artificial intelligence is getting so smart that it can recognize cats, drive cars, beat world-champion Go players, identify cancerous lesions and translate from one language to another, won\u2019t it soon be capable of doing just about anything a person can?Not by a long shot. What all of these tasks have in common is that they involve finding subtle patterns in very large collections of data, a process that goes by the name of machine learning. The kinds of data vary, of course. It might be pixels in cat photos, bytes streaming from a dashboard camera, millions of computer-generated games of Go, digital X-rays or volumes of human-translated documents.But it is misleading to characterize all of this as some extraordinary leap toward duplicating human intelligence. The selfie app in your phone that places bunny ears on your head doesn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d anything about you. For its purposes, your meticulously posed image is just a bundle of bits to be strained through an algorithm that determines where to place Snapchat face filters. These programs present no more of a threat to human primacy than did automatic looms, phonographs and calculators, all of which were greeted with astonishment and trepidation by the workers they replaced when first introduced.And robots may not be welcome in the growth occupations of the future. As we become wealthier, consumers are likely to allocate an increasing share of their income to premium services. This is precisely the segment of the economy where personal care, face-to-face interaction and demonstrations of skill are critical to the value delivered.Luxury hotels are not prized because they are more efficient but because their staff is more attentive. People pay more to watch a barista brew their latte than for a comparable product from a vending machine, and I somehow doubt that our grandchildren will want to tell their troubles to a robotic bartender or prefer to stick their hands in a manicure machine. In the future, the masses may make do with simple-minded domestic robots while the upper crust hires ever more butlers and maids. The Jetsons, after all, were a middle-class family.This trend may begin to play out in our own lifetimes. Many consumers are likely to conclude in the next decade or so that they no longer need to have a car of their own. What\u2019s called \u201ctransportation as a service\u201d (autonomous taxis, on-demand vehicles and ride sharing) will save the typical American family more than $5,000 a year, according to think tank RethinkX.What will we do with that extra money? Spend it, of course\u2014on vacations, clothes, restaurant dinners, concert tickets, spa days and more. That means increased demand for flight attendants, hospitality workers, tour guides, bartenders, dog walkers, tailors, chefs, ushers, yoga instructors and masseuses, even as artificial intelligence reduces the need for drivers, warehouse workers and factory operators.The irony of the coming wave of artificial intelligence is that it may herald a golden age of personal service. If history is a guide, this remarkable technology won\u2019t spell the end of work as we know it. Instead, artificial intelligence will change the way that we live and work, improving our standard of living while shuffling jobs from one category to another in the familiar capitalist cycle of creation and destruction.\u2014Dr. Kaplan is an adjunct professor at Stanford University, where he teaches about artificial intelligence.

But recent missteps mean it will take time for the shares to fully rebound from the loss of confidence among investors.For much of last year, Capital One chief executive and industry veteran       Richard Fairbank       insisted that the gradual rise in defaults on the company\u2019s credit cards was the simple result of \u201cgrowth math.\u201d This is the company\u2019s term for the natural tendency for defaults to rise over time after a period of growth in new loans.However, the company had to twice revise up its forecast for total net charge-offs on U.S. credit cards from something in the \u201clow 4%\u201d range originally to potentially up to 5%. This shook confidence in Capital One\u2019s underwriting because if the cause was just simple \u201cgrowth math,\u201d the company should have seen it coming.On Thursday evening, Capital One reported second-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations slightly. More important, it reaffirmed its April guidance for full-year earnings and charge-offs. Shares rose more than 4% in after-hours trading.Those shares were down 7% so far this year, so they may have been due a rebound. The stock looks undemanding at 0.8 times book value, but that is only a bit below its five-year average of 0.9 times. Given the potential for further increases in charge-offs, investors should steer clear of the stock.The company reiterated guidance is for net charge offs in the \u201chigh-4% to around 5%\u201d range on domestic credit cards this year. This implies that defaults will decline in the second half. In the second quarter the charge-off rate was 5.11%, down slightly from 5.14% the previous quarter but up from 4.07% a year earlier.In a conference call, Mr. Fairbank said the default rate is likely to come down because the impact of \u201cgrowth math\u201d likely peaked in the first half. But with Capital One\u2019s expansion arithmetic having so recently proven faulty, investors should be skeptical. Broader factors such as rising consumer debt levels could easily render this outlook moot.The company also declined to give a forecast for charge-offs next year, despite having done so at this time in 2016. It also said it couldn\u2019t comment on its recent stumble in the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress tests.Decent earnings and a stable outlook are good first steps in shoring up Capital One.

The gradual removal of slack from an economy should lead to upward pricing pressure, as more people find work and have more money to spend on goods and services.\u201cOver all, strong growth, low inflation is a familiar theme for Canada\u2014and a mix that leaves the Bank of Canada able to take rate hikes slow from here,\u201d said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets.Also on Friday the data agency said retail sales in Canada rose 0.6% in May from April, on stronger demand for automobiles.Bank of Canada Gov.       Stephen Poloz       has tried to play down concerns over low inflation, arguing they are largely due to temporary factors, related to the cost of energy and automobiles. He said the Bank of Canada\u2019s job is to target \u201cfuture\u201d inflation, and its forecast has price increases returning close to 2% by mid-2018, as temporary factors fade and the price of food picks up steam.Canada isn\u2019t alone in dealing with surprisingly weak inflation. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to stand pat on its policy rate next week, as its inflation rate drifts further away from 2% and the slowdown appears more broadly based than officials originally suggested. This week, the Bank of Japan pushed back the date when it expects inflation to hit 2%, which it now expects in March, 2020.The Bank of Canada said in its most recent quarterly forecast that other, broader factors could be at play in slowing down price increases\u2014most notably the increased use of automation by firms; the rise of e-commerce, which has forced traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to cut their prices; and a permanent, downward revision to inflation expectations, fueled by negative fallout from the 2008-09 financial crisis.June\u2019s inflation report showed seven of the eight components Statistics Canada tracks recorded increases in prices.Electricity prices fell 5.3% in June from a year ago, after a 5.5% annual drop in May. This is largely attributable to a move by the government of Ontario\u2014 Canada\u2019s most populous province\u2014to legislate lower power prices for households. Gasoline prices fell 1.4%.Total food prices rose 0.6% from a year ago, after posting eight straight monthly declines. The homeowners\u2019 replacement cost\u2014or the price to maintain a residence at its current market value\u2014rose 4.1%.Over all, the price of goods fell 0.5% in June from a year ago, whereas the cost of services\u2014such as a haircut and legal advice\u2014advanced 2.4%.On a seasonally adjusted basis, Canada\u2019s CPI was unchanged in June from the previous month.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-cpi-slows-in-june-1500643243", "keywords": ["canada economy,canada gas prices,canadian cpi,canda inflation,Statistics Canada,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,economic news,consumer price index"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 09:17:00", "news_title": "The Annoying Everyday Drags on the Economy", "content": "People often wonder why they can\u2019t save any money, why all their spare cash seems to go flying out the window. Here\u2019s one explanation: U.S. drivers waste 17 hours a year hunting for parking spaces, resulting in a loss of $345 per driver in wasted time, fuel and emissions. What\u2019s more, Americans throw away $20 billion a year, or $97 per driver, overpaying for parking, according to recent research from transportation analytics and services firm INRIX.In New York City alone, drivers spend 107 hours a year looking for parking spaces, resulting in a loss of $2,243 per driver. In all likelihood, the drivers never find vacant parking spaces because vacant parking spaces in New York City do not exist.These findings fall into a broad category of staggering truths that are hiding in plain sight but only become obvious after attention is drawn to them. This sort of highly specialized analysis can apply to many other routine activities besides parking, by my sophisticated calculations.Here\u2019s an example: You\u2019re standing in line at CVS or             Walgreen\u2019s,       and the person in front of you waits until the cashier rings up all his purchases before reaching into his pocket to get out any money. All told, waiting in line behind numskulls who always seem thunderstruck when they are asked to pay for their purchases costs the average American consumer $237 a year, resulting in a $42 billion hit to the economy. This doesn\u2019t include the $21 billion shelled out for the surgical repair of broken jaws and noses after fistfights erupt in the stores.Melees often result when the dawdling customer begins to count out the 37 pennies needed to make the $1.37 purchase, then finds that she only has 36. Even worse: Sometimes the cashier rings up the $4.39 purchase and begins to make change for a five, only to hear the customer say, \u201cOh, here, let me give you 50 cents.\u201d Being forced to recalculate the change on a $4.39 purchase when one is holding a $5 bill and two seemingly extraneous quarters invariably proves so flummoxing to retail personnel that a store manager must be summoned to conclude the transaction. The deliberate flummoxing of cashiers is now a $31 billion drain on the U.S. economy. Maybe $32 billion.Restaurant wait staff no longer write down customers\u2019 orders, and as a result, $123 billion worth of unrequested food gets thrown away each year. That doesn\u2019t include the $118 billion restaurants toss away when they must comp irate patrons\u2019 meals. Tipping people who shouldn\u2019t even be asking for tips\u2014snooty baristas, lawn-care specialists, the guy who overcharges you to replace your busted thermostat\u2014is another $37 billion drag on the economy.Americans waste 23 hours a year trying to get unsympathetic customer-service reps to remove the $25 late fee from their credit-card statements. They waste 34.6 hours trying on pants they cannot possibly squeeze into. They waste 43 hours a year on hold trying to get nonexistent tickets to \u201cHamilton.\u201dOther ways of wasting time are less obvious but no less costly. Americans squander 56 hours a year dining with in-laws they despise. They toss away 38 hours a year on dental procedures that have no chance of rescuing doomed molars. And they waste 128 hours a year trying to settle the age-old argument over whether Michael Jordan was more dominant than Wilt Chamberlain.If Americans would simply use public transportation, have correct change ready when they buy toothpaste, let go of their basketball arguments and abandon all hope of ever getting tickets to \u201cHamilton,\u201d we could balance the federal budget by Columbus Day.So let\u2019s get cracking.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-annoying-everyday-drags-on-the-economy-1500643043", "keywords": [" humor,joe queenan, wasted time,political,general news,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 09:15:00", "news_title": "The Many Sides of Noomi Rapace", "content": "Before filming started, actress Noomi Rapace worried that her next role would be a \u201csuicide mission.\u201d In \u201cWhat Happened to Monday?\u201d, a             Netflix                   film that debuts in mid-August, Ms. Rapace stars as a set of septuplets in hiding from a government that brutally enforces a one-child policy due to overpopulation. Each of the seven sisters has a very different personality, and for scenes in which they interact, Ms. Rapace filmed alongside a body double or in front of a green screen with tennis balls marking the places of her siblings.Ms. Rapace, 37, is best known for playing Lisbeth Salander, the antisocial computer-hacker heroine in the original Swedish-language \u201cGirl With the Dragon Tattoo\u201d film series (2009), based on Stieg Larsson\u2019s books. After that performance, she quickly learned to speak English and went on to star in Hollywood films, including \u201cSherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\u201d (2011) and \u201cPrometheus\u201d (2012).In \u201cWhat Happened to Monday?\u201d, set in a dystopian future, the sisters are named for days of the week and can only leave their house on that day. Outside their apartment, they must all pretend to be the same person. After the sister named Monday disappears, the others try to figure out what happened to her.\u201cThey feel like they\u2019re all me at different times of my life,\u201d says Ms. Rapace. \u201cI have all the aggression, the dream, the innocence, the shyness\u2014I have it all in me.\u201d The sister named Wednesday, for example, is athletic and energetic. The role reminded Ms. Rapace of her early teenage years, when she first became interested in martial arts.Born Noomi Nor\u00e9n, Ms. Rapace grew up in both Sweden and Iceland. Her mother was a theater teacher, and her stepfather was a farmer. She has met her biological father, a Spanish flamenco singer, only a few times.At age 7, she acted as an extra on the set of an Icelandic Viking film. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go home,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI was covered in dirt, hanging with the horses, and I didn\u2019t want to take my costume off.\u201d After that, she became obsessed with acting and grew determined to leave her parents\u2019 farm. \u201cI always had this really strong feeling of, \u2018I\u2019m going to get out. This is not my life,\u2019 \u201d she says.In her midteens, Ms. Rapace fell in with a rowdy crowd and started drinking. She based the character of the sister named Thursday on those years. \u201cI was very angry and rebellious,\u201d she says.Ms. Rapace soon realized she needed to get sober. \u201cI\u2019ve always been strong-minded, and when I decide to do something, I decide to do it,\u201d she says. She stopped drinking and moved to Stockholm to go to college.That period inspired the character of the sister named Monday. \u201cI straightened up, and then I became so dedicated to college,\u201d she says.She used that same discipline to dramatically improve her English in a short time. On her world-wide publicity tour for \u201cThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\u201d in 2009, she had trouble understanding reporters\u2019 questions, and \u201cthat was my first wake-up call,\u201d she says. She started immersing herself in English films and shows.Ms. Rapace met her former husband, Swedish actor Ola Norell, in her early 20s. When they married, they both changed their names to Rapace, French for bird of prey. They soon had a son. That period\u2014taking care of her son as well as some of her other family members\u2014inspired the character of Sunday, a caretaker who loses her identity in service to others.These days, she considers herself most like the bubbly, vivacious sister named Saturday. \u201cPeople think I\u2019m this very serious [person], more like Lisbeth Salander,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I love to dress up, and I have wig parties in my house where everybody\u2019s having a laugh and being so stupid.\u201dShe was a long shot for the role as Lisbeth. When she first auditioned, the director told her she was too pretty for the part. She said she would cut her hair and pierce her nose and eyebrow. \u201cI am Lisbeth Salander!\u201d she told him.Ms. Rapace is now preparing to play a bodyguard in the coming thriller \u201cClose.\u201d Her training regimen includes cardio in the morning and Pilates or a barre class in the evening, as well as martial-arts practice. In \u201cWhat Happened to Monday?\u201d, her characters fight security agents and SWAT teams. To prepare, she woke up each day at 4 a.m. and spent an hour with a personal trainer before heading to the studio at 6 a.m. When she returned to her hotel at 8 p.m., she spent an hour on the treadmill. For five months, she ate small meals every three hours and had a protein shake for dinner. \u201cI can become really skinny or\u2026stronger, more muscular,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m kind of ready to go to go pretty far to find the person I\u2019m going to play.\u201dFor the past month, Ms. Rapace has been home in London, where she lives with her teenage son. She moved there in 2011 after her divorce from Mr. Rapace. She isn\u2019t home much, though; she\u2019s often moving from one film set to another. \u201cMy dad was a gypsy, and I think I have that in my blood,\u201d she says. \u201cI love moving around.\u201dShe has several films coming out soon: She will appear in \u201cUnlocked,\u201d an action movie with Orlando Bloom, and \u201cBright,\u201d a fantasy co-starring Will Smith, both out later this year. \u201cStockholm,\u201d a crime drama with Ethan Hawke, is scheduled to open in early 2018.Her success over the past decade still surprises her, she says. \u201cThere was a time in my life when I thought, \u2018I\u2019m not going to be alive when I\u2019m 25.\u2019 \u201dAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Noomi Rapace.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-many-sides-of-noomi-rapace-1500642915", "keywords": [" acting, actors, hollywood, movies,netflix,noomi rapace,what happened to monday,political,general news,celebrities,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,movies"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 09:00:00", "news_title": "Big Sur Tourism Drops to a Trickle as a Scenic Drive Turns Into a Footpath", "content": "BIG\u00a0SUR, Calif.\u2014Normally at this time of year, as many as 13,000 vehicles a day whiz by this quaint community\u00a0of cabins and bungalows tucked into the redwoods along\u00a0California\u2019s Highway 1.One day last week,\u00a0Loran Calvin strolled down the winding highway.\u00a0There wasn\u2019t a car in sight.\u201cIt\u2019s both extremely beautiful and a little post-apocalyptic,\u201d Ms. Calvin, a 55-year-old visitor from South Pasadena, Calif., said. She and a few other sightseers hiked a half-mile path with an elevation of several hundred feet to get to a portion of\u00a0Big\u00a0Sur\u00a0now cut off at both ends\u00a0to car traffic\u00a0by damage from storms earlier this year.Residents of\u00a0Big\u00a0Sur\u00a0are accustomed to the price of living amid the dramatic beauty of the mountains that hug the Pacific\u2014enduring mudslides, wildfires and other natural disasters.But the events from this past year are testing even their mettle. The two-lane highway, which traverses vertiginous cliffs and is a popular scenic driving route for tourists, ruptured in two places from mudslides amid torrential downpours this spring.\u00a0While one section of Highway 1 recently opened, traffic will be strictly controlled while repairs continue. Another damaged portion of the Highway 1 may take a year to repair.A bridge is out for repairs at least until September, leaving a 40-mile stretch of highway and the 500 people who inhabit this side of town cut off from ready road access to the outside world. To go to school, commute to jobs and fetch groceries, local residents use a new half-mile hiking trail through Pfeiffer\u00a0Big\u00a0Sur\u00a0State Park state officials built weeks after the bridge closure to connect the divided parts of Big\u00a0Sur.The road closures also have effectively kept out tourists. Around three million visitors a year stream into\u00a0Big\u00a0Sur, and the road closures come at the height of the summer tourist season.The\u00a0Big\u00a0Sur\u00a0Chamber of Commerce pegs the economic losses at as much as $500,000 a day, which have prompted widespread layoffs.Managers at the oceanside,\u00a0hilltop Nepenthe Restaurant\u00a0say they have had to furlough 80 of their 120 employees after the number of diners plunged more than 90% since before the closures in May.\u201cRight now we\u2019re finding out how rugged we are, or aren\u2019t,\u201d said Kirk Gafill, general manager of the 68-year-old eatery owned by his family.Even the northern part of\u00a0Big\u00a0Sur,\u00a0where about 1,000 people live and which still has ready highway access, has been affected. The\u00a0Big\u00a0Sur\u00a0River Inn reports its bookings are down 40% so far this year compared with the same period last year.The Fernwood Campground and Resort has July vacancies for the first time in at least a quarter century; in part, managers there say, because many people incorrectly believe the whole coast is shut down.\u201cFor every reservation we get, there is a cancellation,\u201d said Diana Ballantyne, the resort\u2019s general manager.Economic disruption often hits communities that lose a key transportation artery due to calamity. Sales at stores around parts of Interstate 85 in Atlanta, for example, took a hit after a section of the freeway was closed for two months last spring following a fire that authorities said was set by a homeless man.Not everyone in Big Sur thinks the new isolation is all bad.Kate Novoa, a retired attorney who lives in a remote canyon, says the scarcity of visitors would reduce problems like an increased threat of wildfire and traffic congestion.\u201cThis is kind of like a nice break for us,\u201d Ms. Novoa said.Big\u00a0Sur\u00a0has been isolated before, but never like this. Before, the longest closures of Highway 1 in both directions were in 1983 and 1998, other\u00a0big\u00a0storm years that left the community sealed off for 10 weeks each time. But no one has seen anything like this current disruption of about 20 weeks and counting.The troubles began\u00a0in February, when the California Department of Transportation closed the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge after determining it needed to be replaced after landslide damage. That severed the community\u2019s road access to stores and businesses on the north side of Big Sur, and stopped the flow of visitors from that direction.In May, two mudslides closed the highway to the south of the community\u2014including a monster that buried a quarter-mile stretch under so much debris state officials say it could take at least a year to rebuild.With many of\u00a0Big\u00a0Sur\u2019s visitors typically arriving from the north, stores began shutting down soon after the bridge closure. Hiking trails to the open side also closed temporarily, necessitating groceries and other some other essentials to be airlifted to residents.As the days stretched into weeks, businesses got creative.In late April, the exclusive Post Ranch Inn, which charges up to $2,500 a night for a room, began shuttling in guests by helicopter.\u201cI thought, \u2018Why not try it?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mike Freed, managing partner of the 40-room inn, which plans to continue the helicopter shuttle until the bridge reopens.That prompted Nepenthe to reopen.By May, Mr. Gafill said the restaurant was serving lunch and dinner meals to an average 30 to 40 people a day, including local residents. While that was a far cry from the up to 1,000 guests it serves normally, he said the restaurant has become a de facto community center where locals go to play ping pong, watch movies and socialize.\u201cThe real silver lining has been the rediscovery of who my neighbors are,\u201d said Mr. Gafill\u2019s sister, Erin Gafill, 54, an artist.The trickle of visitors opened up more on July 1, when public access was allowed for the first time on the new hiking path residents were using.\u201cThe trail is good, but it\u2019s just so steep,\u201d Edward Mierzwa, a 67-year-old retiree whose home is on the closed side of the highway, said as he hauled meat, produce and other groceries up the steep trail one day last week.Eventually, residents say life here will return to normal\u2014although many hope not quite as before.\u201cI don\u2019t want it to go back to the way it was,\u201d said 64-year-old Nadine Clark, munching on a salad at Nepenthe last week. \u201cWe were just overrun.\u201dAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Big Sur Sees Tourism Hit By Closures.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-sur-tourism-drops-to-a-trickle-as-a-scenic-drive-turns-into-a-footpath-1500642000", "keywords": ["political,general news,transport,routine general news,leisure,arts,hospitality,tourism"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 09:00:00", "news_title": "Is That Pool Really Sanitary? New Chemical Approach Has Answers ", "content": "An artificial sweetener found in more than 4,000 foods, beverages and pharmaceutical products turns up in swimming pools in unusually high concentrations.That\u2019s intriguing until you learn how it gets there. Then it\u2019s just gross.\u201cIt\u2019s evidence people are peeing in pools,\u201d said Lindsay Blackstock, a doctoral student in analytical and environmental toxicology at the University of Alberta, Canada.Mrs. Blackstock and several colleagues tested 31 swimming pools and hot tubs in hotels and recreational facilities in Canada for the presence of acesulfame potassium, an artificial sweetener that is largely undigested and almost entirely excreted in urine.There\u2019s an ick factor to swimming in a pee-tainted pool, but the real concern is what happens chemically. Urine combines with chlorine to create byproducts that irritate the eyes and respiratory system, and the spent chlorine is no longer available to kill disease-causing germs.Pool operators continually replenish chlorine to keep the water safe, but tests like Mrs. Blackstock\u2019s help them figure out what substances are affecting the chemistry.Sold under the brand name Sunett, acesulfame potassium is 200 times sweeter than sugar and represents 8% of the global high-intensity sweeteners market,\u00a0according to Sergey Gudoshnikov, a senior economist with the International Sugar Organization.It\u2019s used in products including baked goods, frozen desserts, chewing gum, diet sodas, sport drinks, fruit juices, toothpaste, mouthwash, breakfast cereals, condiments, snack foods, soups, cough syrups, jams and jellies.Mrs. Blackstock and her colleagues were inspired to look for acesulfame potassium in pool water because it is also used as a proxy to estimate the impact of human waste on groundwater, lakes and rivers.They found it in all of their pool and hot-tub samples, and in far greater concentrations than in the water sources\u00a0used to fill them. \u201cWe saw an increase of four times greater and up to 570 times greater in recreational water samples compared to tap water samples,\u201d Mrs. Blackstock said.The researchers also measured the amount of ACE-K, as it\u2019s known for short, in urine samples from 20 Canadians to arrive at a rough estimate of the normal concentration in the general population.Using that information, they deduced that a 110,000-gallon pool they studied contained an estimated eight gallons of urine, while a 220,000-gallon pool contained an estimated 20 gallons. The concentrations represented about 0.01% of the total water volume.\u201cIf your eyes are turning red when you\u2019re swimming, or if you\u2019re coughing or have a runny nose, it\u2019s likely there is at least some urine in the pool,\u201d said Michele Hlavsa, chief of the Healthy Swimming Program for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Urine isn\u2019t a primary source of germs in pools or hot tubs, but feces that clings to the body is. At any time, Dr. Hlavsa said, adults have about\u00a00.14\u00a0grams of poop on their bottoms and children have as much as 10 grams.\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about bigger water parks with 1,000 children in a given day, you\u2019re now talking about 10 kilograms or 22 pounds of poop,\u201d she said.Feces can contain bacteria, viruses and parasites such as E. coli, norovirus and giardia that can lead to outbreaks of diarrhea, vomiting and other illnesses.In 2011 and 2012, the most recent data available, the CDC recorded at least 185 illnesses stemming from exposure to these or similar organisms in pools, hot tubs and spas. Nearly 900 more cases were attributed to a chlorine-resistant parasite known as cryptosporidium.\u201cWe\u2019re not so worried about pee,\u201d Dr. Hlavsa said. \u201cWe\u2019re worried it will use up the chlorine that kills germs.\u201dACE-K isn\u2019t the only way to estimate the amount of urine in pools and hot tubs.Ernest R. Blatchley III, an environmental engineer at Purdue University who studies swimming-pool chemistry, has done it by measuring urea, a component of urine. German researchers have used calcium, which is also excreted in urine.But there is another tool that anyone can use: Their nose.Appropriately chlorinated swimming pools and hot tubs smell strongly of the disinfectant only when it has combined with substances like urine, lotions and hair products. A healthy pool has very little odor, Dr. Hlavsa said, and it should not turn your eyes red.The solution to keeping it that way is straight forward.Shower for about one minute before swimming to remove personal care products and traces of feces. And stop using the pool like an Olympic-size toilet.Write to Jo Craven McGinty at Jo.McGinty@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-that-pool-really-sanitary-new-chemical-approach-has-answers-1500642001", "keywords": ["chlorine, swimming,swimming pools, water pollution, water treatment,University of Alberta,political,general news,chemicals,pharmaceuticals,food,beverages,tobacco,sugar products,health care,life sciences,basic materials,resources,consumer goods,food products,sugar substitutes"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 08:57:00", "news_title": "Canada Retail Sales Rise 0.6% in May on Autos", "content": "OTTAWA--Canadian retail sales climbed in May for a third straight month, powered by demand for new and used cars.Excluding the auto component, retail receipts fell slightly.The value of retail sales in May rose 0.6% on a seasonally-adjusted basis to 48.91 billion Canadian dollars ($38.86 billion), Statistics Canada said Friday.

Results for May have been encouraging, with two-way trade picking up momentum and a solid gain in factory sales.The Bank of Canada expects household expenditures to remain robust in the near term, supported by job gains and firmer wage growth. But consumption is then expected to ease as housing activity slows down, and consumers deal with elevated debt loads amid an environment of rising borrowing costs. The Bank of Canada this month raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time in seven years amid an improving economy.According to the May retail report, five of the 11 sectors tracked posted increases from the previous month.The motor-vehicle and parts component rose 2.4% in May to C$13.08 billion, after a decline the previous month, led by sales of new and used cars, as well as auto parts.Food and beverage stores recorded a 0.9% gain, to C$10.11 billion, on higher sales at grocers and a big jump in alcohol sales, as warmer weather emerged and Canadians celebrated the Victoria Day long weekend.Offsetting the gains was a 0.6% drop in sales at gasoline stations, the first drop in three months. The data agency attributed the decline to lower prices at the pump.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/autos-drive-canada-retail-sales-higher-in-may-1500641641", "keywords": ["auto sales,canada retail sales,canadian economy,interest rates,retail sales,Statistics Canada,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic news,retail,wholesale"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 08:09:00", "news_title": "What the NBA Can Learn From a WNBA All-Star ", "content": "The single most important skill for any basketball player today is the ability to shoot. The sport has changed so radically in recent years that becoming a better shooter instantly means becoming more valuable\u2014and Connecticut Sun point guard Jasmine Thomas is proof.Before her seventh WNBA season, Thomas was a known quantity: a good player with one thing preventing her from being a great player.She was a mediocre 3-point shooter. Now she\u2019s one of the WNBA\u2019s best 3-point shooters.Thomas is taking more threes and making a higher percentage of them than ever. Here are the results: Connecticut sits atop the Eastern Conference, its offense has seen the biggest statistical leap of any WNBA team and Thomas is starting in her first All-Star Game this weekend.Her unlikely overnight improvement is instructive beyond the WNBA. She is an example of a player who has fit her game into basketball\u2019s evolution. Thomas was a 30% outside shooter who is suddenly a 45% shooter\u2014and even she is still getting used to that new identity.\u201cI\u2019m not considering myself a 3-point shooter,\u201d said Thomas, who was leading the WNBA in 3-point shooting last week. \u201cI have people on my team who are actual 3-point shooters.\u201dA player\u2019s shooting is supposed to be like a player\u2019s height. At a certain point, it doesn\u2019t change.Thomas was a 29.7% career 3-point shooter coming into this season. That was also her exact 3-point percentage last season. But this season: 45.3%.It may be easiest to understand how remarkable that is by looking at some NBA players who have done the same thing. Except there are none. There are no guards in the history of the NBA who were in the league as long as Thomas, and shot as much as Thomas, before such a dramatic, one-season deviation from his career 3-point percentage, according to Stats LLC.The NBA has its own explosive point guard who shoots about 30% from deep: Russell Westbrook. The league\u2019s reigning most valuable player turning himself into a 45% shooter, though, would make every defense shred its game plan for guarding him. They would have to cover Westbrook farther away from the basket, and Oklahoma City\u2019s entire offense would benefit from the extra space.That small improvement would make a big difference for the Thunder. It already has for the Sun.WNBA teams had settled on a strategy for guarding Thomas before this season. When she called for a ball screen, her defender sagged back and dared Thomas to shoot. \u201cThat was part of the scout on me,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you have to give up something, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to give up.\u201dBut other teams didn\u2019t know Thomas had quietly overhauled her game in the off-season. She went to Israel with the singular goal of concentrating on her shooting. She didn\u2019t want to simply shoot better. She wanted to shoot more.WNBA stars usually spend their off-seasons playing in Turkey, China and Russia, but Israel turned out to be a land of opportunity for Thomas. She was the best player on her team, and the lesser competition allowed her to get repetitions as a scoring guard. Thomas spent her time overseas drilling herself to shoot without hesitation whenever she had open looks\u2014not in practice, but in real games. That was the only way she\u2019d get herself in the right mind-set when she returned to the WNBA. She came back from Israel newly confident in her stroke even without changing her mechanics.Sun coach and general manager       Curt Miller       was encouraging Thomas the whole time. Months before the WNBA season, she texted him asking for permission to skip a game for her brother\u2019s wedding, and he approved as long as she promised to increase her assists and improve her 3-point shooting. The very first game after her brother\u2019s wedding, Thomas went 5-of-7 from three, the best shooting night of her WNBA career. Her development was critical to the Sun embracing the modern style that Miller was trying to implement.\u201cMy philosophy is spacing is offense,\u201d he said, \u201cand offense is spacing.\u201d\u201cIn order for us to play the way we want, we need to be able to spread the floor,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIn order for us to spread the floor, I have to be able to hit that shot.\u201dAlmost no one could have seen the transformation coming. Richard Cohen, a Londoner who writes about the league on his website WNBAlien, said the experience of being in the league for seven years had made Thomas a savvier player in recent seasons. \u201cBut the breakout shooting,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was no sign of that.\u201dAt first he thought it was a fluke. But there hasn\u2019t been a regression, and there may not be one. While the long NBA season is the enemy of aberrations, the WNBA season is only 34 games. It\u2019s short enough that wacky things can happen for a whole year.WNBA legend Swin Cash went through a similar experience. She made 27% of her career threes, but Cash shot 41% in one outlier season after her coaches emboldened her to keep launching even if she missed. They thought her team would benefit from Cash shooting, and they were right: Seattle won the WNBA championship that year.\u201cIt completely changes the game plan and allows her teammates even more flexibility,\u201d Cash said of Thomas. \u201cBy individually improving her game, it makes her team better.\u201dThe three-point shooting that has revolutionized the NBA has also hit the WNBA. The league pushed the arc back almost two feet before the 2013 season, but the number of threes per game is already nearly back to what it was. There are more pick-and-rolls, more small ball and more interchangeable positions, like the NBA, and those shifts have put a premium on players who can stretch the court with their shooting.Thomas is now one of those players. Some teams still gamble that she won\u2019t be able to keep this up\u2014that she\u2019ll eventually become a 30% shooter again. But most teams respect her stroke, and Thomas being able to shoot from deep makes it easier for her to get close to the basket.\u201cShot fake, one-dribble pull up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives me the opportunity to go back to what I\u2019m really comfortable with.\u201dWrite to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-the-nba-can-learn-from-a-wnba-all-star-1500638994", "keywords": ["basketball,connecticut sun,jasmine thomas,nba,three-point shooting,wnba,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 08:03:00", "news_title": "CMO Today: Trump Bump \u2018Waned\u2019; AB InBev Buys HiBall; Sinclair\u2019s Rise", "content": "Good morning. In scenes reminiscent of 1995, TV viewers were glued to their screens on Thursday as regular daytime programming was tossed aside to air O.J. Simpson\u2019s parole hearing. Even ESPN and CNBC got in on the act. AP has more on how each network covered O.J.\u2019s return to the courtroom.Omnicom CEO John Wren warned on his company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call yesterday that the so-called \u201cTrump bump,\u201d at one time thought to be boosting the U.S. economy, \u201chas waned a little bit,\u201d CMO Today\u2019s Suzanne Vranica reports. The lack of clarity on regulation, tax policy and health-care costs has caused \u201cmany companies to pause in terms of the investment that they are trying to make, and advertising and marketing is part of what suffers,\u201d he said. In North America, Omnicom posted just 0.2% organic revenue growth in the quarter. While Mr. Wren also acknowledged its lackluster North America performance was dragged down largely by its PR, shopper marketing and branding businesses, his comments suggest that the U.S. agency sector is once again having to deal with the word it most dreads: \u201cuncertainty.\u201dAnheuser Busch InBev agreed to acquire energy drinks and sparkling water maker Hiball for an undisclosed sum, The Wall Street Journal reports. AB InBev has been expanding its portfolio as consumer drinking habits shift away from American lagers like Budweiser. Nonalcoholic drinks now make up around 13% of the company\u2019s global volume, although in the U.S. that percentage is negligible. Last year AB Inbev signed a deal with Starbucks to sell ready-to-drink tea. Hiball, which markets its drinks as \u201cdelicious, premium, natural, and healthy organic energy\u201d offers a way for AB InBev to appeal to consumers\u2019 more refined taste palates. AB InBev has the distribution network and marketing chops to transform the drinks startup into a far bigger name.Bloomberg Businessweek has a deep dive into local TV giant Sinclair, which is in position to become a force in conservative news and commentary, as it pushes \u201cmust run\u201d segments into newscasts at its stations. This is something very different from Fox News -- there are no plans to create a national news network and the production values are considerably lower. Sinclair\u2019s reach is due to get larger thanks to its proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Company, which will add 42 more stations to its portfolio. It also has plans to deliver a wireless bundle of channels. Key line from the piece: \u201cThe more the company grows, the more leverage it holds over networks, syndicators, advertisers\u2014and politicians, who continue to lean heavily on local TV to get their message out.\u201d However, behind the scenes there is some conflict among Sinclair journalists, frustrated about an \u201capparent blurring of news and advertising\u201d and the company\u2019s penny-pinching ways.Earlier this week, I linked to Financial Times\u2019 columnist Lucy Kellaway\u2019s excellent piece on corporate claptrap.

Working with closely held Kulr Technology Corp., the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is developing systems that wedge heat-absorbing carbon-fiber materials and even tiny water reservoirs between the battery cells to head off blazes.NASA\u2019s initial goal was to prevent fiery accidents from lithium-battery malfunctions in space suits. The first modified suits are scheduled to be sent to the international space station in coming months. Future electric planes and unmanned Mars rovers could get later versions of the technology.The fire-prevention designs under development by NASA and Kulr aren\u2019t meant for laptops or smartphones, but they are set to be used in consumer products such as centralized audio controls for homes and Ubtech Robotics Corp.\u2019s Lynx, a new humanoid robot. Lynx features             Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s       Alexa digital assistant and is slated to go on sale this summer.Ubtech, a fast-growing Chinese robot maker, is in the final stages of testing the Lynx robots, which will offer facial-recognition capabilities and personalized greetings, along with other features available on Amazon\u2019s Wi-Fi connected Echo speakers.       Goti Deng,        closely held Ubtech\u2019s chief strategy officer, said the \u201cdemands for battery performance are really high,\u201d but \u201cright now Kulr is a star\u201d in finding ways to reduce the risk of dangerous overheating.Ubtech already relies on Kulr to safeguard robots sold by major U.S. retailers such as             Best Buy Co.       and             Costco Wholesale Corp.       By early 2018, Mr. Goti said, his company plans to incorporate more-capable cooling technology in its next-generation robots intended for airports and museums.Kulr Chief Executive       Michael Mo       said the company is far enough along to start assessing commercial applications, ranging from medical devices to drones to electrical systems on airliners.The company, which is based in Campbell, Calif., also has signed a wide-ranging marketing deal with Jabil Circuits Inc., a manufacturer of electronic products for customers such as             International Business Machines Corp.      ,             HP Inc.       and             Xerox Corp.\u201cBattery technology has outpaced thermal-protection technology,\u201d said       Keith Cochran,        Jabil vice president of global business units, who added that Kulr\u2019s technology \u201cis very credible and the products work.\u201d He said he expects Jabil to showcase Kulr\u2019s technology in a line of home audio-control equipment within a few months.Lithium power packs installed in robots, lights and some appliances are growing more powerful. They pose increasing challenges for fire-suppression systems, particularly if shipments burst into flames in cargo holds of airplanes. Fires hot enough to melt aluminum fuselages\u2014which were sparked or fed by large shipments of lithium batteries\u2014destroyed three large jets over the past decade. Each year dozens of emergencies and diversions prompted by smoldering or flaming laptops in airliner cabins are reported world-wide.Against this backdrop, NASA\u2019s research is attracting attention from other federal agencies. Battery experts from the Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration have requested details of certain laboratory techniques, said       Eric Darcy,        a top NASA battery expert.For NASA, which describes Kulr\u2019s approach as \u201cvery promising,\u201d having a variety of cooling options is important to ensure safe power in different types of hardware, including portions of the aging space station and solar-arrays under development.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anyone else doing the testing that we\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Darcy said.Prompted by a pair of high-profile lithium-battery fires on Boeing Co. 787 jetliners in 2013, NASA decided to see if it could reduce the hazards of such malfunctions so \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t be catastrophic events\u201d in orbit, Mr. Darcy said.Kulr\u2019s Mr. Mo and his management team predict they will get a jump on competitors because their technology aims to make batteries only 5% heavier, compared with current technology that adds 15% to 20% in weight.By encapsulating water in specially treated carbon-fiber based pockets, the company has been able to keep cell temperatures below 158 degrees Fahrenheit even when an adjoining test cell\u2019s temperature climbed to about 1,000 degrees in one 2016 test cited by NASA. Recent lab results have been even more favorable, according to company test summaries.Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'NASA Work to Prevent Fires Finds Uses on the Ground.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nasas-work-to-head-off-battery-blazes-in-space-finds-uses-on-earth-1500638400", "keywords": [" alexa, battery,battery fires,lithium ion batteries,nasa, space,space research,NASA,Jabil Circuits,Amazon.com,AMZN,Boeing,BA,Best Buy,BBY,HP,HPQ,Hewlett,International Business Machines,IBM,Airbus SE,AIR.FR,FR:AIR,Costco Wholesale,COST,Xerox,XRX,Kulr Technology,UBTECH Robotics,Eric Darcy,Goti Deng,Keith Cochran,Michael Mo,product,consumer safety,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,robotics,sciences,humanities,space exploration,travel,transport accidents,transport,airlines,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 07:49:00", "news_title": "What to Look for in Private Student Loans", "content": "With the new academic year starting in a matter of weeks, student-loan and college-finance experts say there is still time to make some smart money moves.On the to-do list: Shop around for private student loans and apply for scholarships.\u201cHousing deposits must be paid during the summer and college bills come due at the end of the summer, so now is the right time to bring your college financial plan up to date,\u201d says Mark Kantrowitz, a financial-aid expert and publisher of Cappex.com, a college-planning site.While experts say students should prioritize federal loans because they are cheaper and have better repayment terms, among other reasons, private student loans offer financing for those who exhaust the U.S. government\u2019s Direct Loan, or Stafford Loan, program. For a student supported by his or her parents, those limits range from $5,500 for a college freshman to $7,500 for a senior.Private student loans are nonfederal education loans made by banks and other financial institutions such as credit unions and online lenders such as SoFi. The lender sets the terms and eligibility for private student loans and the interest rate and fees are usually based on the credit score of the borrower or any co-signer. (Co-signers, who are equally responsible for the debt, may help the student qualify for a lower interest rate since the loan\u2019s rate and fees are typically based on the higher score of the two borrowers.)One of the biggest problems is that many people don\u2019t research the loans. Twenty-five percent of families don\u2019t comparison-shop for private loans, according to a recent survey of 1,200 consumers by online lender CommonBond Inc.Mr. Kantrowitz says to apply for several loans in order to compare the actual interest rates and fees. \u201cShop around as the best advertised rate might not be the rate you get,\u201d Mr. Kantrowitz says. Among the details to consider or disregard:\u2022 Compare both the monthly payment and total payments over the life of the loan. A longer repayment term will yield a lower monthly payment but increase the total amount due, he says.\u2022 Generally avoid using a loan\u2019s annual percentage rate to compare costs. A longer-term loan will generally have a lower APR but the borrower will pay more in total interest over the life of the loan, he says. Rather, compare loans based on the total interest or total payments over the life of the loan.\u2022 Remember variable-rate loans\u2019 interest rates change over time and may increase beyond those on a loan that has a fixed interest rate, Mr. Kantrowitz says. A variable interest-rate loan may be cheaper for borrowers planning to pay the loan off early, though.Another potential cost-saver: By signing up for auto-payments, borrowers may also be able to lower their interest rate by 0.25 to 0.50 percentage point.Some websites to search for scholarship money and a bit about what each site offers:Experts also say that students shouldn\u2019t overlook scholarships. While many scholarships have deadlines that occur during the school year, some do exist with late-summer deadlines.\u201cThere are millions of dollars that are available over the summer, so it\u2019s not too late or too early to apply,\u201d says Christopher Gray, co-founder of Scholly, a scholarship website.Scholarships that have unusual eligibility requirements are usually easier to win (if you fulfill the criteria, that is), since there will be fewer applicants, he says. The same goes for smaller scholarships that are around $1,000 to $5,000 since many students don\u2019t apply for them thinking they aren\u2019t meaningful amounts, Mr. Gray says.Write to Veronica Dagher at veronica.dagher@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-to-look-for-in-private-student-loans-1500629405", "keywords": ["political,general news,higher education costs,education,personal finance,scholarships,student loans,university,college"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 07:44:00", "news_title": "Blackstone, CVC Join Payments-Sector Deal Frenzy With $3.8 Billion Paysafe Bid ", "content": "Blackstone Group        BX -0.17%       LP and CVC Capital Partners have teamed up on a $3.8 billion\u00a0bid for U.K. online payments processor             Paysafe Group        PAYS -0.17%       PLC,\u00a0joining a wave of consolidation in the payments sector.The bid, if successful, comes as businesses and consumers are increasingly carrying out transactions online using smartphones and other mobile devices. The trend is expected to drive demand for the services of Paysafe and its competitors that can process online payments securely.At the same time, the payment-processing sector is under pressure to consolidate as a way to cut costs amid greater regulatory scrutiny and rising competition that risks squeezing fees.Earlier this month,             Vantiv Inc.

This week Nordic Capital Ltd., a Jersey-based private-equity firm agreed to sell Stockholm-based payment-services firm Bambora\u00a0for \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.75 billion) to French payment-technologies company Ingenico Group SA.The Blackstone-CVC consortium first approached Paysafe in May, eventually offering \u00a35.90 ($7.67) a share. That represents\u00a0about a 9% premium to the Isle of Man-based company\u2019s closing price\u00a0Thursday, though the stock has risen steadily since May amid expectations of bid given the spate of deal-making in the sector. Paysafe said that the bid represents a 34% premium to its volume-weighted average price for the six months to end-June.In London trading around noon Friday, Paysafe was up 7% at \u00a35.80.Paysafe said its largest shareholder Old Mutual Global Investors U.K. Ltd., with about a 10% stake, has signed a nonbinding letter of intent to support the deal.The acquisition of Paysafe would give Blackstone and CVC significant exposure to the online gambling and gaming sectors. A big part of the company\u2019s business is its digital-wallet technology, which allows users to make bets online without tapping money from their bank accounts. That business generated revenue of $311 million for Paysafe last year, the second-biggest contributor to its overall revenue after payment-processing services.

A son and two grandsons fought for Islamic State and were killed by the Iraqi forces who wrested their town from the extremists.Mrs. Rasheed and her surviving sons and grandsons said they were prepared to embrace a new Iraq under the Shiite-led government in Baghdad\u2014but Shiite militias guarding their town said they would arrest the men if they return.\u201cIf we\u2019re unable to return home, we\u2019ll join whatever comes after Islamic State,\u201d said Mrs. Rasheed, who is now living with 13 family members in a one-bedroom home on the outskirts of Baghdad. On the day she spoke, a double suicide attack killed nine pro-government forces in her town, Garma, about 35 miles east of Ramadi.Such is the challenge Iraq faces in rebuilding cities and towns liberated from Islamic State amid a cycle of sectarianism that shows little sign of ending and an insurgency that remains active across much of the country.Iraqis from the Sunni Arab minority have been on the outside of power since the 2003 ouster of       Saddam Hussein\u2019s       regime\u2014an upheaval that ushered in the multiple reincarnations of Sunni insurgency that spawned Islamic State.Three years ago, when Islamic State took over about 40% of Iraqi territory, its gains were restricted to Iraq\u2019s three Sunni-majority provinces.With the recent recapture of the city of Mosul, Sunni lands have now been largely retaken. Yet one-third of the country\u2019s seven million Sunni Arabs have been displaced. Some are blocked from returning at checkpoints manned by Shiite or Kurdish militias screening for militants. Others are prevented from returning because of Islamic State mines.Many more have no homes to return to, after the militants and the battles to remove them destroyed their towns and cities.\u201cIslamic State flourishes in poverty and desperation,\u201d said Ibrahim al-Awsaj, mayor of the Sunni city of Ramadi, which was retaken from the Sunni extremists more than a year ago. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a second, third or fourth version of Islamic State.\u201dThe mayor rattled off the problems his city has faced since it was retaken 1\u00bd years ago. Around 80% of infrastructure remains damaged, including 40,000 of the city\u2019s 63,000 residential units. Electricity and running water haven\u2019t been fully restored.In this climate, said Mr. Awsaj, who is Sunni, tens of thousands of war widows are struggling to feed their children, many of them sons and daughters of Islamic State fighters. That leaves families vulnerable to insurgents who have drafted child soldiers and lured the destitute by offering salaries.Government officials say rebuilding has been slow because of a lack of federal funds and international aid. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said this month that the government is working at maximum capacity to return the displaced.U.S. Col. Ryan Dillon, the spokesman for the U.S.-led international campaign to defeat Islamic State, praised what he said were Mr. Abadi\u2019s efforts to involve all ethnicities and religions in reunification and reconstruction.\u201cThe Coalition recognizes that is one of the most important things to future stability in Iraq,\u201d he said.For many Sunnis, Baghdad isn\u2019t doing enough. \u201cThis government is a complete failure. The only thing it\u2019s good for is corruption and sectarianism,\u201d Mrs. Rasheed said.That view has helped fuel multiple incarnations of Sunni insurgency in Iraq. After the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, a group of Iraqi and foreign fighters emerged as al Qaeda in Iraq. The group was soon infused with military officers forced by the U.S. from their posts, with thousands of government officials, because they were members of Saddam\u2019s Baath Party.Disgruntled security officers established the insurgency that haunts Iraq today.VIEW InteractiveThe insurgents killed thousands of American and Iraqi troops before the group was severely weakened by 2007 and melted back into the population.In the years that followed, they pursued a low-level insurgency while maintaining ties to local Sunni communities.Sunni discontent with the government continued to fester, and in 2013, Sunni insurgents took advantage of antigovernment protests in parts of Iraq. They called themselves \u201ctribal revolutionaries\u201d\u2014then, in 2014 unfurled their black banners and morphed into Islamic State.As the group sought to set up a religious empire across Iraq and Syria, it presented itself as the protector of a minority under siege.Three years of war against Islamic State have done little to heal the divides between majority Shiites and the sizable Sunni Arab and Kurdish minorities.The latest Sunni militants once again have gone underground after being dislodged from most of Iraqi territory, though their attacks remain a fixture of everyday life.The Iraqi government is working to regain the population\u2019s trust to fight off future radicalism by employing local residents to help with reconstruction.\u201cWith Islamic State, Iraqis have learned their lesson. Islamic State ended in destruction and Iraqis won\u2019t let themselves be cheated again,\u201d said Dr. Majda Mohamed, spokeswoman for a special task force designed to stabilize post-Islamic State areas.Baghdad still doesn\u2019t have enough money to rebuild war zones. Iraq\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on oil and the global slump in prices left the central government without enough revenue. About $210 million has been put into Iraq\u2019s reconstruction fund since it was created in 2015, far from the $100 billion that the government estimates is needed.In some places where reconstruction has started, residents said corruption is seeping into the process.Saad Hamadi, 33, clears Ramadi\u2019s streets of the postwar detritus. As a city employee, he is supposed to be paid 15,000 Iraqi dinars a day, or about $13. He said he usually gets 10,000 dinars because the municipality charges him to use their tools. That, he says, is illegal.\u201cWe already lack services and then we see that we are victims of corruption,\u201d said Mr. Hamadi. \u201cThe people talk, but no one listens to us.\u201dRamadi\u2019s mayor said there is no corruption in his municipality.In the town of Yathrib in Salahuddin province, Adel Hashmawi\u2019s Sunni tribe of 60,000 people have been blocked from returning home by Shiite tribes and militias who accuse them of supporting Islamic State.Mr. Hashmawi acknowledges that Islamic State had some support among them, but asked why his entire tribe is being punished.He linked this treatment to the grievances that saw Islamic State ride to power in the first place. \u201cWe thought: we are between two evils. But the evil of Islamic State is less than that of the government,\u201d Mr. Hashmawi said.Mr. Abadi, the prime minister, recently responded to charges that Shiite militias and the government are collectively punishing Sunni communities: \u201cWe want to apply the law, we do not want to punish innocent people,\u201d he said.Mr. Hashmawi said his town eventually realized the horrors of Islamic State, and many, including himself, tried to flee.He said his tribe has paid about $3 million in reparations\u2014\u201cblood money\u201d\u2014to neighboring Shiite tribes that lost members to Islamic State attacks. But new grievances emerge daily.Mr. Hashmawi accused one of Iraq\u2019s largest Shiite militias, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, of working with the Shiite tribes to prevent his tribe\u2019s return. An official for the militia, Qassem al-Darraji, blamed Shiite tribes, and said the militia was trying to mediate.What is clear in Yathrib is that the government is absent.\u201cWhat\u2019s needed is social reconciliation,\u201d said Dr. Darraji. \u201cBut in Iraq, that\u2019s difficult.\u201d\u2014Ghassan Adnan contributed to this article.Write to Maria Abi-Habib at maria.habib@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/among-iraqis-freed-from-isis-resentment-festers-1500634800", "keywords": ["daesh,isis,islamic state,sectarian war,shiite,sunni,al Qaeda in Iraq,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,terrorism"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 07:00:00", "news_title": "Wal-Mart, Amazon Rivalry Spreads to Forklifts ", "content": "The rivalry between             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Wal-Mart is already Plug Power\u2019s biggest customer, with 5,500 of the company\u2019s units in 22 warehouses.In April, Amazon agreed to spend $70 million on Plug Power\u2019s vehicles and received rights to buy as many as 55.3 million shares in the company, a 19% stake.Wal-Mart will receive warrants to purchase the exact same number of shares, though its initial price will be higher than Amazon\u2019s because Plug Power\u2019s stock price has risen 63% since announcing its Amazon deal. Wal-Mart\u2019s potential stake is 17%, Mr. Marsh said.The warrants vest based on how much the two retailers spend on Plug Power\u2019s products and services. Wal-Mart and Amazon would need to spend $600 million each for all their warrants to vest.Plug Power\u2019s vehicles are powered by hydrogen fuel cells as an alternative to lead-acid batteries. Through a chemical reaction, fuel cells convert natural gas, hydrogen or other gases into electricity. Traditional batteries need to be changed more often and the process is slower than recharging a forklift powered by fuel cells, Plug Power executives say.Plug Power also sells fuel-cell-powered vehicles to             Home Depot Inc.,Kroger Co.       and others. It generated $85.9 million of revenue in 2016, and Wal-Mart accounted for 34% of it.

News of Amazon\u2019s move into appliances, one of the categories it hasn\u2019t deeply penetrated, rippled through the industry. Investors dumped shares of big appliance sellers that have benefited from Sears\u2019s retreat. For Sears, selling Kenmore outside its own stores or websites could boost sales, which have declined every year since 2007\u2014but it also leaves shoppers one less reason to visit a Sears store.

AMZN 1.24%       marks an important step for the troubled retailer and for the online giant that\u2019s provided Sears its biggest competitive threat. Sears will start selling its Kenmore line of refrigerators and stoves on Amazon\u2019s website, the WSJ\u2019s Imani Moise and Suzanne Kapner report, marking the first distribution of Sears kitchen appliances outside of its own stores. That\u2019s a dramatic step for the struggling retailer, but it also pushes Amazon more deeply into the large-appliance business, one of the few corners of retail where it has yet to penetrate deeply. Both companies will upend their supply chains to make the plan work. Amazon will buy the Kenmore inventory, but it will reside in Sears\u2019s warehouses, and a Sears distribution unit will ship the goods to customers\u2019 homes and have them installed. Sears is hoping the tie-up brings more foot traffic while Amazon is effectively taking in more real estate, and a distribution operation to go with it.It\u2019s no wonder Sears is looking to Amazon as a savior of sorts, at least for its appliance business. A comparison of the two retailers over time provides a graphic illustration of how the companies have effectively swapped places over recent years. The WSJ\u2019s Yaryna Serkez and Theo Francis write that major financial and scale measures for the companies completely crossed from 2009 to 2017, with Amazon overtaking and surpassing Sears even in physical space as the online retailer has bulked up in distribution centers. Amazon has surged from 17 warehouses to more than 260 in 30 states, most of them opened in 2015 and 2016. Sears has scaled back from some 2,000 stores to 1,200 in that time, and its 31 domestic distribution centers are down from 39 in 2009. Most significant may be that Amazon generates $400,000 in revenue per employee against Sears\u2019 $160,000, a gap that illustrates the challenge facing traditional retailers.Volvo Car Corp. will start its transformation into an all-electric brand in China.

The food chain reopened a Virginia location that it had shuttered this week after reports that customers had gotten sick there, and the WSJ\u2019s Julie Jargon reports that more than 100 people may have been sickened. Chipotle says the cause of the outbreak was a norovirus that didn\u2019t come through the food supply, and the local health department says there\u2019s no early indication the illness came through the supply chain. For the chain, a pioneer in the fast-casual restaurant category, the shutdown recalls incidents a couple of years ago that sent Chipotle\u2019s planners scrambling to redesign how they prepared, packaged and shipped their food. Those tougher controls may be one reason Chipotle is so confident the more recent outbreak was limited to one site.\u2018This venture will allow us to achieve lower prices in global markets, faster development of technology and to get more resources.\u2019Decline in grain shipments carried by major U.S. railroads during the second week of July, according to the Association of American Railroads.A new report says supply-chain disruptions from extreme weather are growing but companies are doing little to assess risks.

Activist shareholder Elliott Management isn\u2019t impressed.After BHP\u2019s chief potash analyst wrote a bullish blog item on the commodity\u2019s outlook, Elliott warned in a terse statement that the comments sounded \u201calarmingly familiar.\u201d Elliott is already leading a shareholder movement to push BHP out of the U.S. oil business and increase returns, which it says have lagged behind its main competitor, Rio Tinto.Deutsche Bank                   estimates the massive Jansen mine the company is building in Saskatchewan, Canada, could ultimately cost a cool $13 billion to develop. BHP has yet to make a final call on further investment to complete the project but Chief Executive       Andrew Mackenzie       said in May that management could seek board approval as soon as next year.The amount of cash involved could make such a greenlighting of BHP\u2019s potash ambitions its most important strategic decision over the next five years.There is little doubt that potash is risky. However, Elliott is wrong to draw a direct analogy between it and shale. BHP\u2019s main mistake there was investing at the top of the commodity bubble in a new, highly technical sector in which it had little experience.By contrast, potash prices are down by more than half from their 2008 and 2009 highs, and the mining technology is well established. BHP has long argued it needs to diversify into different commodities to smooth out its earnings, but iron ore and oil are subject to many of the same demand drivers: namely, Chinese industry and construction. Fertilizer, ultimately driven by food demand, does offer the company genuine diversification. And while China\u2019s construction boom is slowing structurally, the world\u2019s growing food needs look to be a surer bet. Climate change will also likely make arable land scarcer, meaning the same acres will have to produce more food.The main worry with potash isn\u2019t demand, but supply: By most estimates the market will be saturated for the next decade, driven by major producers in Canada and Eastern Europe. BHP\u2019s project wouldn\u2019t come online until the mid-2020s, but even if it is able to leverage the latest technology and equipment to produce cheaply, margins might be unimpressive for the first few years. The best hope for substantial profits earlier on would be big mine closures from competitors now\u2014a possibility if potash prices remain low in the years it takes BHP to build the Jansen mine.Finally, there is always technological risk with such long-term projects: Just ask Canadian oil-sands producers such as Royal Dutch Shell if they would have invested had they known that the Americans would figure out a way to profitably squeeze oil out of shale basins.Big mining companies need to keep investing\u2014that is unavoidable. The key questions are always when, and in what.

Mr. Moon has also advocated the reopening of a joint inter-Korean industrial park and cooperation between the two sides at the Winter Olympics, which are scheduled to take place in South Korea early next year.Mr. Moon\u2019s dovish approach to inter-Korean relations comes even as the U.S., the United Nations Security Council and the European Union weigh tougher sanctions on North Korea following the isolated country\u2019s test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching parts of the U.S.But North Korea has appeared to pour cold water on Mr. Moon\u2019s outreach, describing his Berlin speech as \u201cnonsensical sophism\u201d and offering no formal reply to Mr. Moon\u2019s proposal this week.\u201cSo far they have not responded to any of the positive feelers that the new administration has put forward,\u201dsaid       Scott Snyder,        a senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.Mr. Snyder said that while Mr. Moon is following a previous playbook that led to summit meetings between North Korea\u2019s then-leader       Kim Jong Il       and his South Korean counterparts, current North Korean leader       Kim Jong Un       doesn\u2019t seem to be as receptive to Seoul\u2019s advances.Mr. Snyder said it might be more productive for South Korea to work on building trust with North Korea behind the scenes, \u201crather than continuing to put forward public balloons that the North Koreans seem to be popping.\u201dTom\u00e1s Ojea Quintana, the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur for North Korea human rights, said Friday that Mr. Moon\u2019s engagement proposal is \u201ca reassuring step forward to lower tensions that have built up between the two Koreas over the past months.\u201dMr. Ojea Quintana, speaking to reporters in Seoul at the end of a five-day visit to South Korea, urged more patience, adding that \u201cany process of engagement might take time\u201d and that he is optimistic that North Korea would respond positively to the South Korean proposal.The developments came as the U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization warned of food shortages in North Korea after months of drought in the country, which it called the country\u2019s worst since 2001.Vincent Martin, the organization\u2019s representative for China and North Korea, called for \u201cimmediate interventions\u201d and increased food imports over the next three months to ensure adequate food supply.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korea-presses-north-on-bid-to-restart-talks-1500630226", "keywords": [" korea family reunions, koreas, north korea missiles,north korea nuclear,north korea south korea talks,north korea weapons,South Korea's defense ministry,political,general news,international relations,politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 05:30:00", "news_title": "From Fort Knox Clerk to Insurance Kingpin: The Rise of AIG\u2019s New CEO ", "content": "It would be hard to find anyone in insurance with a longer resume than             American International Group Inc.\u2019s        AIG -0.15%       new chief executive       Brian Duperreault.Mr. Duperreault started as an actuarial trainee at AIG in 1973, straight out of a postcollege stint in the U.S. Army. He rose through the company\u2019s ranks to become a senior executive, before leaving in 1994. Over the past 23 years, he has turned one niche offshore insurer into a large and diversified company, become CEO of a big industry brokerage and co-founded his own insurance firm.In returning to AIG, his plan is straightforward: Grow AIG.He thinks the company has shrunk enough after unloading a series of businesses to help repay a nearly $185 billion U.S. government bailout, and then selling more assets to finance share buybacks. Mr. Duperreault wants to expand in part through acquisitions as well as AIG\u2019s life and personal lines insurance businesses, particularly internationally.\u201cI [was] looking at my alma mater having issues,\u201d the 70-year-old said in his first extensive interview since taking the AIG job in May. \u201cMy head was saying, \u2018Don\u2019t do it,\u2019 because I had a great job. But my heart was telling me otherwise.\u201dOver the past few weeks, Mr. Duperreault has brought in executives from outside the company and plans to increase use of data science and predictive analytics, particularly as a way to expand sales to midsize businesses.Many of AIG\u2019s 56,400 employees are now meeting Mr. Duperreault for the first time through town halls in New York, Boston, Chicago, London and Dublin, so far. Among things they are learning: Their new boss has deep faith. A Roman Catholic who was educated by nuns in Trenton, N.J., he later attended the Jesuit-run St. Joseph\u2019s University in Philadelphia, Pa.\u201cFaith and family are the two things I wanted them to understand about me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important element of running a company is doing the right thing, and faith gives one the courage to do that.\u201dMr. Duperreault said he speaks publicly of his religious side \u201cwhen I am being asked about who I am.\u201d He has publicly thanked God for his successes, and keeps a Bible in his office for \u201cwhen I feel that I have to read it.\u201dMr. Duperreault didn\u2019t initially aim for an insurance career. He went to St. Joe\u2019s to study chemistry, but \u201cI just wasn\u2019t any good at lab work.\u201d He majored in math, then after college he enlisted in the Army during the Vietnam War and spent three years doing clerical work at Fort Knox, Ky.Upon discharge, job choices were limited with a stalled U.S. economy. Actuaries were in demand.\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about actuarial science,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I know is, I needed a job.\u201dHe was hired at AIG, then a midsize property-casualty insurer, in the early stages of its transformation into one of the world\u2019s largest financial-services firms by its CEO, Maurice R. \u201cHank\u201d Greenberg.Mr. Duperreault\u2019s first assignment was to create divorce insurance that would guarantee income should a marriage fail. While that product wasn\u2019t launched, he eventually became a key lieutenant of the legendarily hard-charging Mr. Greenberg.Mr. Duperreault said he left AIG in 1994 to determine if he had \u201cthe wherewithal to stand alone and succeed\u201d without Mr. Greenberg.In an interview, Mr. Greenberg said he is pleased to see Mr. Duperreault back at AIG, calling him \u201ca good choice.\u201d Mr. Greenberg left AIG in 2005 and now runs insurance and investment firm Starr Cos.Mr. Duperreault replaced       Peter Hancock,        who lost his hold on the CEO job earlier this year after delaying profit-improvement deadlines. Mr. Hancock had been narrowing AIG\u2019s focus through divestitures.\u201cI think Brian is wise in getting rid of that liquidation strategy,\u201d said Mr. Greenberg, referring to Mr. Hancock\u2019s divestitures. Turning around AIG \u201cwill take time, and you have to have a strategy to differentiate AIG from other companies. He\u2019s had a lot of training, been in the industry a long time. But time will tell.\u201dMr. Duperreault\u2019s first job outside of AIG was as CEO of             ACE Ltd.      , which back then was a liability-insurance specialist. The job returned him to his birthplace: Bermuda, where he was born to American parents. Over the next decade, he diversified and expanded ACE through acquisitions. In 2004, he stepped down as CEO and became nonexecutive chairman.In 2008, he became CEO of then-struggling brokerage and consulting firm             Marsh & McLennan Co      s. He cut costs, strengthened management and acquired smaller firms to bolster growth. He left in 2012.The following year, while on a dinner cruise in Hamilton, Bermuda, he mentioned still having \u201cgas in the tank\u201d to insurance executive David Brown. Mr. Brown knew that hedge fund Two Sigma Investments, a leader in quantitative analysis, was looking to get into insurance, and he put Mr. Duperreault in contact with them.That led to Mr. Duperreault co-founding Hamilton Insurance Group in 2013 with Two Sigma\u2019s principals. As part of Mr. Duperreault\u2019s new job, a Two Sigma affiliate aims to work with AIG on an insurance platform.AIG today is far different than the one Mr. Duperreault left in 1994. Gone to repay its bailout are Asian life-insurance operations, aircraft leasing and other crown jewels. Also gone are some former rivals such as             Aetna Inc.       and             Cigna Corp.      , which divested property-casualty units. New competition has emerged, including             Chubb Ltd.       That insurer is the former ACE and is run by Hank Greenberg\u2019s son Evan, who succeeded Mr. Duperreault at ACE.\u201cYou need to have great rivalries to make you better,\u201d Mr. Duperreault said. \u201cSo it\u2019s actually a wonderful thing, in a way, that they\u2019re out there and they\u2019re so good because it\u2019s going to make us better.\u201dWrite to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'From Fort Knox Clerk to AIG\u2019s Head Honcho.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-fort-knox-clerk-to-insurance-kingpin-the-rise-of-aigs-new-ceo-1500629400", "keywords": ["aetna,aig, aig ceo,brian duperreault, catholic,chubb,cigna, faith,hank greenberg, insurance, insurance ceo, jesuit,American International Group,AIG,St. Joseph's University,Starr,Brian Duperreault,David Brown,insurance,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 05:30:00", "news_title": "Big Tobacco Finds Surprise Allies in Smokeless Push", "content": "Tobacco companies want U.S. regulators to bless smokeless tobacco as a safer alternative to smoking, as cigarette consumption in the country falls. In its campaign, Big Tobacco has unusual supporters: some public-health advocates.Many scientists agree that moist, smokeless tobacco, including chewing and dipping tobacco, is significantly less harmful than cigarettes. But rather than encouraging the country\u2019s 37 million smokers to switch to less-risky products, U.S. health officials have so far stuck with an abstinence-only message to the public.Online fact sheets published by the Centers for Disease Control, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institute list multiple health risks associated with smokeless tobacco\u2014including cancers of the mouth, esophagus, and pancreas\u2014but give no indication it is less harmful than cigarettes. \u201cThere is no safe form of tobacco,\u201d the cancer institute says on its website.\u201cThe \u2018not safe\u2019 message is not enough,\u201d said Lynn Kozlowski, a public health professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo.Mr. Kozlowski is one of several academics and public-health experts advocating for U.S. health agencies to provide the public with information on the relative risks of tobacco products.\u201cThe risk of tragedy from keeping people in the dark is much greater than the risk of tragedy from informing people,\u201d he said.The Truth Initiative, a U.S. antismoking group, has embraced the so-called harm reduction approach, encouraging smokers who are unable to quit to switch to products such as Swedish-style tobacco pouches called snus or \u201cproperly regulated\u201d e-cigarettes.The debate is coming to a head as the Food and Drug Administration considers whether to approve new marketing claims for smokeless tobacco and other products.In April,         Reynolds American Inc.       submitted applications to market six styles of Camel Snus tobacco pouches as being less harmful than cigarettes.             Philip Morris International Inc.       also has an application pending for a new device that heats tobacco instead of burning it. The FDA is expected to decide next year whether Philip Morris can say on labels and in marketing materials that switching from cigarettes to its IQOS device significantly cuts exposure to harmful chemicals and the risk of tobacco-related diseases.\u201cNewer and more novel forms of delivering nicotine\u2026could be incredibly helpful to curtail cigarette smoking if [smokers] completely switched,\u201d said       Mitch Zeller,        director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products. He declined to discuss any pending health-claim applications, but noted smokeless tobacco poses lower health risks. \u201cWe have to have an open mind.\u201d\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s not nicotine that causes disease and death,\u201d he said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be thinking about various forms of nicotine delivery?\u201dThe FDA will make its decision after recommendations are made by agency scientists and an independent advisory board.Smokeless tobacco in the U.S. has been associated with oral cancer, heart disease and other illnesses in multiple studies. But what kills 480,000 people in the U.S. each year is the cigarette smoke that carries harmful compounds into the lungs. Federal officials caution that publicizing the relative risks of smokeless tobacco could lead to unintended consequences, such as greater uptake among youth.\u201cThe best way to fully protect yourself from these risks is to completely quit the use of any tobacco products,\u201d said Brian King, a deputy director in the CDC\u2019s Office on Smoking and Health.A federal law passed in 2009 made it illegal for tobacco companies to make health claims unless given permission by the FDA. In December, the agency partially rejected an application by             Swedish Match North America Inc.       to market its General brand tobacco pouches as less harmful than cigarettes. The FDA invited Swedish Match to revise its proposed health claims.In Sweden, the smoking rate has plummeted to 7%\u2014the lowest in the European Union\u2014as many men switched to snus. Men in Sweden now have a lower tobacco-related death rate than in any other EU country.Reynolds and             Altria Group Inc.,       which make the Grizzly and Copenhagen brands, respectively, command 80% of the $8.7 billion smokeless-tobacco market in the U.S. That market has been growing even as cigarette consumption declines.At recent scientific conferences, Altria has presented an analysis of two federal surveys showing that users of moist, smokeless tobacco were at least 90% less likely to die over the course of the surveys than cigarette smokers. The U.S. data included nearly 387,000 survey respondents. Altria now is preparing this analysis for submission to an academic journal.\u201cWe think it is important to contribute to scientific understanding of tobacco harm reduction,\u201d an Altria spokesman said.In interviews, federal health officials said more research needs to be done on the potential population-level consequences of broadcasting the fact that some tobacco products are safer than cigarettes.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at a point yet where we can give specific recommendations for harm reduction,\u201d said Mark Parascandola, an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly getting closer.\u201dWrite to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-tobacco-finds-surprise-allies-in-smokeless-push-1500629402", "keywords": ["anti-smoking,dip,health,lung cancer,smokeless tobacco,smoking,snus,tobacco,tobacco companies,Altria Group,MO,Philip Morris International,PM,Reynolds American,RAI,Swedish Match,SWMA.SK,SE:SWMA,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,drug,substance usage,political,general news,society,community,social issues,agriculture,farming,tobacco farming,food,beverages,tobacco products,consumer goods"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 05:27:00", "news_title": "Geely\u2019s Rally Is Running Out of Road", "content": "Geely Automobile, one of China\u2019s most prominent auto makers, has been the gift that kept on giving for investors, with its shares up nearly threefold in the past year despite cooling sentiment in China\u2019s car market. The company\u2019s latest joint venture with Sweden\u2019s Volvo to produce premium cars is a sign it isn\u2019t slowing down.On the surface, all looks well. Geely, which shares a parent company with Volvo, earlier this month told investors it expects first-half profit to double. Surging sales of its small sport-utility-vehicle models, fueled by tax incentives, have driven its overall car sales up 90% this year, even as the broader Chinese market grew only 3.8%. The company now expects to sell more than 1 million cars in 2017.Under the hood, though, there are signs of frailty. Geely\u2019s hopes of becoming a truly global car maker have been stymied by choppy exports. At home, retail-sales volumes have been trailing Geely\u2019s wholesale volumes. For some of its best-selling car models, for instance, around one in five cars sold wholesale has remained unsold to final buyers over the past five months, according to Bernstein analysts.The new 50-50 venture with Volvo, under the             Lynk        GELYY -2.36%       & Co. brand, is Geely\u2019s latest to keep growth on track. Under plans announced Thursday, Geely will tap demand from tech-savvy, luxury global car buyers drawn to its connectivity features. But there will be costs. For example, the joint venture is acquiring intellectual property to develop the cars, which could hit future profit as amortization charges kick in. The newly created entity will also have to pay royalties to an affiliated research center that came up with the new brand. Such costs along with higher production expenses could erode margins, lending uncertainty to how much the new venture will actually add to earnings.Investors already appear skeptical: Geely\u2019s shares fell as much as 4.7% Friday as they digested the news. That still leaves Geely as one of the most expensive auto makers in the world, trading at 16.5 times forward earnings, compared with Asian peers trading at 9.2 times. After Friday\u2019s tap on the brakes, Geely\u2019s share price may struggle to accelerate again.Write to Anjani Trivedi at anjani.trivedi@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/geelys-rally-is-running-out-of-road-1500629226", "keywords": [" china car market, china cars,geely, lynk & co, suv, volvo,Geely Automobile Holdings,0175.HK,Volvo,VOLV-B.SK,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,ownership changes,joint ventures,consortia,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,car registrations,vehicle sales,economic news,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,commodity,financial market news,motor vehicles,passenger cars,automotive"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-21 01:00:00", "news_title": "Financier Anthony Scaramucci Likely to Be Named White House Communications Director", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Financier       Anthony Scaramucci,        a top donor to President       Donald Trump       during the campaign, is expected to be named White House communications director on Friday, two White House officials said.Mr. Scaramucci, 53 years old, is the founder of hedge-fund investing firm SkyBridge Capital and a hedge-fund conference known as SALT. Known as \u201cThe Mooch,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci previously hosted a financial TV show on             Fox Business Network                   and has been a frequent guest advocating for Mr. Trump on cable news shows.Mr. Scaramucci didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Separately,       Marc Kasowitz,        Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney who is representing him in Special Counsel       Robert Mueller\u2019s       probe of the links of the president\u2019s associates to Russia, is expected to take on a lesser role on Mr. Trump\u2019s outside legal team, according to a person familiar with the shift.Mr. Kasowitz\u2019s spokesman, Mark Corallo, resigned from his post this week after less than two months on the job, according to a person familiar with his decision, after privately expressing frustration over the administration\u2019s handling of episodes such as the revelation of a meeting Donald Trump Jr. arranged in June 2016 between top campaign aides and a Russian lawyer.Mr. Corallo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Scaramucci, who worked at             Goldman Sachs                   and graduated from Harvard Law School, would join a communications office that has been a target of criticism from Republicans in Washington and Mr. Trump himself.The White House has been seeking a communications director since       Mike Dubke      resigned from the role at the end of May, \u200bas the president aimed to reset his administration amid expanding probes into his associates\u2019 ties to Russia. Mr. Scaramucci had been a top candidate for the role of director for the Office of Public Liaison before it was given to       George Sifakis.Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s new job was first reported by Axios.com.The president has complained privately that the press team has been at times too slow or ineffective in defending him, most notably following his firing of former FBI director       James Comey.       But some White House officials counter that the West Wing has a problem with decision making, not public relations. Several people approached by White House officials have turned down offers to join the team, people familiar with the conversations said.Since Mr. Dubke resigned, press secretary       Sean Spicer       has been filling in for the role of communications director, while deputy press secretary       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       has taken over at the podium for most White House briefings, which have been off-camera since late last month.Mr. Scaramucci was active during the 2016 presidential race. After having originally supported Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker for the Republican presidential nomination, and then former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, he threw his support behind Mr. Trump and became one of his most vocal supporters.Mr. Scaramucci is serving as chief strategist at the U.S. Export Import Bank. His appointment to that role followed months of uncertainty about Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s prospects of joining the White House, after a promised role in the White House was handed to someone else.The move to shift Mr. Scaramucci to the communications team comes as Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are crafting a strategy that aims to contain Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation and ensure it doesn\u2019t veer into Mr. Trump\u2019s private business dealings.\u201cThe special counsel\u2019s investigatory activities are limited by his mandate. And looking at a real-estate deal from 10 years ago would exceed that mandate,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, referencing a Bloomberg story that said Mr. Mueller is looking into Trump business deals dating back years.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers also would be looking at potential conflicts of interest in the Mueller legal team, Mr. Sekulow said. \u201cConflict of interest issues, if they arise, will be addressed in due course through the normal legal channels if we get to that stage. Any lawyer would look at potential conflicts,\u201d he said.The recourse for Trump\u2019s legal team would be to first approach Mr. Mueller and then the deputy attorney general overseeing the investigation,       Rod Rosenstein,        Mr. Sekulow said. \u200bMr. Mueller\u2019s office declined to comment.Write to Michael C.
