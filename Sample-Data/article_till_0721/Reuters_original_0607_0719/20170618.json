Thomas, decked out in shocking fluorescent pink pants, produced a no less electric performance signing for nine-under 63 to equal the lowest numerical score in a major and the best ever in the 117-year history of the U.S. Open in relation to par. But the 24-year-old American will start Sunday's final round trailing by a stroke after Harman turned in a rock-solid five-under 67 to top the leaderboard alone at 12-under 204.  I was glad to hang in there, especially that last group,  said Harman, who is playing his first weekend at a U.S. Open in three attempts.  It's tough to see everyone doing well and be wanting to do well.  It's hard to stay patient but I was proud of the way I did that.  A dizzying day of action could be topped on Sunday with six players within three shots of the lead all eyeing their first major.

Harman, bidding to become the first left-hander to win a U.S. Open, is a winner on the PGA Tour this year while Thomas is the world number 13, a three-time winner this season and a member of the exclusive ‘59’ club after breaking 60 at the Sony Open this year.

I'm looking forward to my shot at it, and I know it's not going to be an easy day.  I've been there a handful of times and had some good finishes but I'm looking forward to getting the job done.  Players again took full advantage of a softened Erin Hills layout on Saturday, the course left defenseless by overnight rain and only a slight breeze. Slideshow (9 Images)They fearlessly attacked the pins and nobody was more ruthless than Thomas, who ripped apart the links-style layout carding nine birdies and two bogeys before capping his record-smashing effort by coolly rolling in an eight-foot putt for eagle at the par-five 18th. Johnny Miller owned the previous best round of eight-under 63 set en route to victory in the final round at the 1973 U.S. Open at Oakmont.  I'm a part of history. It means I have a lot better chance to win the tournament than I did when the day started,  said Thomas after becoming the 29th player to shoot 63 in a major championship. Greg Norman and Vijay Singh did it twice, for 31 rounds of 63 in total. A score of 62 remains elusively out of reach.  I felt like I've been playing pretty well all week and didn't have quite the numbers to show for it,” Thomas continued.  “Obviously, today I definitely had something to show for it.  I had no idea that nine-under was the best ever in an Open, so that was pretty cool once I saw my card.   The guys at the scoring table told me that, so I was pretty pumped about that.” Editing by Andrew Both","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-usopen-idUSKBN1980P9"},

Justin Thomas on Saturday became the fifth player to post a 63 in a U.S. Open, joining Miller, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Weiskopf and Vijay Singh but Thomas is the only one to do it on a par-72 course. Miller, though impressed by Thomas, was not exactly in awe.  Taking nothing away from nine under par, nine under is incredible with U.S. Open pressure,  Miller told GolfChannel.com.  But it isn't a U.S. Open course that I’m familiar with the way it was set up.  It looks like a PGA Tour event course setup. I’m not sure where the days of the 24-to-29-yard-wide fairways that we played every time went. It’s interesting to see where the USGA has gone with the U.S. Open, being a little more friendly than in years’ past.  The course wasn’t designed to be soft, and if it was going to be soft, it should have been 26-or-27-yard-wide fairways. That’s what made it easy. The guys weren’t afraid to bomb it. It was never that way in the U.S. Open. It was always about really tight fairways and having to be a great driver. This went totally against the tradition of the U.S. Open.” In defence of the U.S. Golf Association, the wide-open course was designed and set up to be played in strong winds and with firm and fast fairways and greens. But the weather this week has not co-operated with ample rain and only light breezes leaving the layout at the mercy of the world’s best players. Miller shot his eight-under 63 in the final round en route to victory in the 1973 U.S. Open at Oakmont, and he will be more impressed if Thomas, or anyone else in contention, can put together a 63 on Sunday.  For one, the greatness of my round is the 63 in the last round of the U.S. Open to win by one,  said Miller, now an analyst for the American TV network NBC. “Everything else is way secondary. If somebody does it tomorrow to win the U.S. Open by one, that’s the specialness of my round. And secondly, Erin Hills isn’t exactly Oakmont.” Another 63 is perhaps unlikely, because the breeze is finally predicted to pick up on Sunday, perhaps offering a stern test, though the course will probably remain fairly soft. Brian Harman, at 12-under 204, takes a one-shot over fellow Americans Thomas and Brooks Koepka and Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, with Rickie Fowler two back. Harman and Thomas will tee off in the final pairing at 2:54 p.m. Central (1954 GMT).  There will be an 18-hole playoff on Monday if the leaders are tied after 72 holes.

But Nationals manager Dusty Baker would still prefer to find a less dramatic way to win. A Nationals pitcher got the best of Mets slugger Yoenis Cespedes in a key spot for the second straight game Saturday, when left-hander Enny Romero induced Cespedes to hit into the double play that produced the final two outs of Washington's 7-4 win at Citi Field. On Friday night, Cespedes stepped to the plate with two outs in the eighth and the Mets down 4-1 against Nationals ace right-hander Max Scherzer, who whiffed Cespedes to cap an 11-pitch battle. Washington went on to win, 7-2. As far as Baker is concerned, he'd rather not try to go 3-for-3 in Sunday's series finale.  You're flirting with a rattlesnake,  Baker said of Cespedes.  You're going to get bitten. So I'd rather not flirt with him.  Cespedes, who is 11-for-24 since coming off the disabled list June 10, bit the Nationals all day Saturday. He singled in his first three at-bats before launching a solo homer off Joe Blanton into the second deck in left field in the eighth inning. Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at MetsWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchNew York Mets - PlayerWatchRomero had already wriggled out of a jam in the eighth when he recorded the final two outs and whiffed potential go-ahead run Rene Rivera to strand two runners and thrown 30 pitches when Cespedes stepped to the plate following Michael Conforto's bloop single. But Baker said taking his chances with the southpaw against the right-handed hitting slugger was the best option available to him. The Mets alternate lefties with righties beginning with Conforto -- Jay Bruce was on deck when Cespedes batted -- and Baker said the last lefty in his pen, Oliver Perez, was unavailable Saturday.  We were hoping that Enny kept the ball down,  Baker said.  When you've got great hitters like Cespedes, boy, you hope that he hits it at somebody. Because you know he rises to the occasion.  Romero, throwing sinkers, fell behind Cespedes 2-0 before Cespedes pulled the next pitch to third base, where Anthony Rendon began the 5-4-3 double play to close out Romero's second save.  There's always a time of decision,  Baker said.  And fortunately for us, Enny did his job today.  Romero's escape acts capped an afternoon in which the beleaguered Nationals bullpen -- it entered the day with a 5.17 ERA -- walked the tightrope against the Mets who had the tying or go-ahead run step to the plate in the sixth, seventh and eighth innings. But despite allowing six hits, Romero and four other relievers combined to limit the Mets to two runs in relief of Stephen Strasburg (8-2). The right-hander allowed two runs, six hits and two walks while striking out five in 5 1/3 innings.  Our bullpen did a great job,  Baker said.  They got 11 outs - that's a lot of outs.  Trea Turner homered on the second pitch of the game for the Nationals (42-26), who have not trailed in winning the first three games of the four-game series. Washington is now 11 1/2 games ahead of the third-place Mets (30-37).  This isn't football, so we don't do pep talks every night,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  The one thing I try to tell these guys every day -- I had a talk with two of the veteran guys yesterday -- is they can't get down about the situation.  Lobaton homered in the second inning and scored on an error in the fourth. Daniel Murphy finished 2-for-4 with an RBI double and scored on Adam Lind's two-run homer into the upper deck in the eighth. Turner singled in the ninth and scored on a double by Rendon (2-for-4).  Having back-end (bullpen) guys do well, having our starters do phenomenal, I think it's just a whole team effort,  Lind said. Wilmer Flores hit into a run-scoring double play in the fourth and lofted a sacrifice fly in the sixth for the Mets, who received an RBI single from Jose Reyes in the eighth. Cespedes scored three runs while Bruce (three singles) and Reyes (two singles) each had multiple hits. Right-hander Seth Lugo (1-1) took the loss after giving up four runs (three earned), seven hits and two walks while striking out five in 6 2/3 innings.  You've got to focus every pitch and a couple pitches got me today,  Lugo said.  That happens.

One of the Twitter accounts suspended belonged to Radio Miraflores, a station set up by Maduro that broadcasts from the presidential palace, including a salsa music program the president hosts.   Twitter in Venezuela today deactivated thousands of people's accounts,  Maduro said at televised rally.  Simply for being 'Chavistas,'  he said, using the term for followers of his predecessor, late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. Chavez was a pioneer among politicians in the use of Twitter, gathering millions of followers and frequently announcing news on the platform. Even today, Chavez's 4 million followers beat Maduro's 3 million.  Maduro encouraged a pro-government journalist to publish photos of the head of Twitter in Venezuela, to show people  who was responsible for the manipulation.  It was not immediately clear if Twitter has employees in Venezuela. Media contacts listed on Twitter's corporate website did not return email requests for comment. The company does not list Caracas among the cities where it has international offices.  It was not clear why the accounts were suspended, or how many had been affected. Earlier, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said 180 accounts were hit.  Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro (C) attends a meeting with supporters in Caracas, Venezuela June 17, 2017.

Twitter's guidelines say accounts can be suspended for abusive behavior, security or spam, among other reasons. Despite the strong words, Maduro encouraged his supporters to keep using the service as a way of countering online the opposition, which has taken to the streets over the past two months to demand elections, protest restrictions and complain about crippling food and medicine shortages.

The battle on social media is very important.     On Saturday, hundreds of opposition activists held prayer services in Caracas and other cities to oppose Maduro's plan to rewrite the constitution, while the government held rallies in several regions to support the initiative.  The protesters have kept the pressure on the government, with clashes with security forces killing at least 72 people since April.  Maduro threatened opposition leader and former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles on Saturday, saying he would sooner or later  face justice  for deaths in an earlier round of protests.  In April, authorities banned Capriles, who narrowly lost the presidential election in 2013, from holding political office for 15 years, a key factor fuelling the protests.

Roberts called the Dodgers the best team in the division.  If he believes that, he needs to say what he feels,  Lovullo said.  More power to him.  Lovullo seems fine with letting his team's play do the talking. The Diamondbacks scored four times in the seventh inning and received a strong outing from Zack Godley to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-1 on Saturday evening. Arizona (43-26) has won six straight while the Phillies (22-45) sustained their 10th loss in 11 games. The Diamondbacks have the same record as the Dodgers, but both are a game behind Colorado for first place in the NL West.  It's a good feeling,  Lovullo said.  They deserve it and should enjoy it.  With the score tied at 1, the Diamondbacks took advantage of Philadelphia's lack of middle relief strength to tilt the contest in the seventh. Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at PhilliesArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchPitcher Jorge De La Rosa, who relieved Godley in the bottom of the sixth, attempted a sacrifice bunt with none out and a runner on first. Catcher Andrew Knapp made a poor choice trying to cut down the runner at second base and the Phillies came away without an out on the play. That opened the door for Daniel Descalso, who knocked an RBI single through the hole on the right side after battling in a seven-pitch at-bat. The crushing blow came two batters later, when Arizona's Paul Goldschmidt got a first-pitch hanging curveball from Casey Fien -- the second pitcher the Phillies used in the inning -- and split the gap in left-center field for a two-run double. The Diamondbacks made it 5-1 on a Brandon Drury single.  We've won some games where we haven't played our absolute best and won some close games,  Goldschmidt said.  If you're going to win some games, you have to win them like that sometimes.  De La Rosa (3-1) was credited with the win after facing just one batter. Edubray Ramos (0-4) took the loss after allowing three runs on two hits without retiring a batter. Godley posted a career-high eight strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings. He allowed one run on five hits and walked three.  What more could you ask? I know he gave up one run,  Lovullo said.  We kind of clipped him a little bit short and didn't let him finish that final inning, but it was time to hand it off to the bullpen, and make sure we did things to win the game. But once again, Zack was outstanding.  Phillies starter Jerad Eickhoff also surrendered one run. He labored early and settled down in his later innings, pitching six total. He allowed five hits, walked three and struck out a pair.  He had better command of his fastball and he threw really good curveballs,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  He just located. That's a pretty good hitting team and to hold them to one run is pretty good.  It wasn't quite good enough. Arizona, which opened the scoring on a Jake Lamb RBI single in the third inning, had a chance to add on to its lead in the sixth. With runners on second and third and one out, catcher Chris Iannetta drove an Eickhoff slider to left field. Aaron Altherr camped under it in left and delivered a strike to cut down Lamb at home and keep the Arizona lead at 1-0. The Phillies tied it in the bottom of the inning on Knapp's sacrifice fly. Philadelphia had two runners in scoring position with two outs in the third, fourth and seventh innings, but failed to come away with runs. Michael Saunders, with the bases loaded, had a line drive snared by Goldschmidt to end the seventh.  It could have changed the whole game,  Mackanin said.

For myself, my first walk-off as a Brave, it really means a lot, playing in front of my family and friends.  It was Phillips' third hit of the game and the seventh game-ending hit of his career.  I have a feeling he knew (the pitch) was coming and I don't care, because if I execute he doesn't do anything with it,  Ramos said. The two-seamer, though, was down the middle, just like Ramos (1-3) had missed location on a slider to Phillips an inning earlier. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at BravesMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchAtlanta sent the game to extra innings as Nick Markakis followed a leadoff double by Phillips in the ninth with an RBI double off the first base bag.  This is going to happen from time to time,  Ramos said.  You don't want it to, but sometimes you have a bad game. The bullpen has been solid until today.  Phillips, Markakis and Matt Adams all had three hits. Adams drove in four runs on a homer and two doubles.  It just shows our grind as a team,  Phillips said.  We're never out of any game.  Adams has 17 extra-base hits among his 32 hits since joining Atlanta on May 21 in a trade from St. Louis after first baseman Freddie Freeman broke his wrist. Nine of Adams' 10 homers have come as a Brave.  It's fun to be a part of, just seeing how guys grind out at-bats,  Adams said.  We're just a group of guys going out there, having fun and playing the game.  Tyler Flowers homered as well for the Braves, who had scored just three runs while losing their previous four home games. Arodys Vizcaino (3-2) pitched the top of the 10th for the Braves. He worked around a two-out single to JT Riddle and a wild pitch. Adams staked the Braves to a 3-0 lead with an RBI double in the first inning and a two-run homer in the third, but the Marlins scored five runs in the fifth against Jaime Garcia after the Atlanta starter had faced one batter over the minimum the first four innings. Tyler Moore plated the first two runs with his sixth homer. A balk and wild pitch preceded a tying RBI pinch single by Ichiro Suzuki, batting for Marlins starter Jeff Locke. Christian Yelich followed an intentional walk to Giancarlo Stanton with a two-out, two-run double. Reliever Ian Krol allowed RBI singles to Justin Bour and Dee Gordon in the sixth after replacing Garcia, who was charged with six runs in 5 2/3 innings after recording a 1.49 ERA in his previous five starts. The Braves cut into the Marlins' lead in the sixth against reliever Brad Ziegler. Flowers hit his fifth homer leading off the inning and Camargo delivered a RBI single. Flowers' drive was misjudged by Yelich in center field with two outs in the seventh and the Braves made it a one-run game as Adams followed with his second RBI double. Ramos also had a chance to trap Camargo off second base in the 10th on a comebacker, but made a bad throw.  We got to turn the page and not let this snowball,  Gordon said.  We've been playing good baseball. We have to have a (short) memory. This was just a little punch in the chest.

And for the second straight day, they needed extra innings to decide on a winner. This time, though, it was the Padres who prevailed as Corey Spangenberg and Chase d'Arnaud hit solo home runs in the 11th inning to lead San Diego to a 7-5 victory. The Padres hit five home runs, accounting for six of their seven runs. Yangervis Solarte hit a pair, giving him three in his last two games and four in his last five. He tagged Chase Anderson for a solo shot in the second inning that gave San Diego a 1-0 lead and struck again in the 10th with a two-run blast off Carlos Torres that put the Padres up 5-3. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at BrewersSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatch Our guys fought all day,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  You look up, you get down three to one. You battle back late. You tie the game against a very a good bullpen. You take some good swings in extra innings too.  The Brewers hit three of their own, including an inside-the-park homer by Orlando Arcia that put Milwaukee on the board in the third. Eric Thames followed with a two-run homer later in the inning, giving him a blast in four straight games as well as putting Milwaukee up 3-1. But Dinelson Lamet clamped down after that, facing just one over the minimum over his final three innings after Thames' home run and finished with a career-high 12 strikeouts.  For (Lamet) that is the best stuff I've seen,  Green said. Brewers starter Chase Anderson was locked in, too, but gave up an RBI double to Hunter Renfroe in the fourth then served up a solo home run to Myers in the sixth that tied it 3-3.  It was a good outing,  Counsell said.  The first homer that Solarte hit I thought was a pretty good pitch. It was a changeup down and away from him. The second one, Myers got 3-0 and Chase got the middle of the plate. He pitched well. He pitched very, very well again. He's on quite a run right now.  That left things up to the bullpens. San Diego held Milwaukee scoreless over the seventh, eighth and ninth innings, allowing one base runner while the Brewers' relief corps stranded the go-ahead run in scoring position in the eighth and ninth. Carlos Torres retired his first two batters in the 10th before walking Myers. Solarte followed with his second home run of the game, putting the Padres ahead.  It didn't sound like it hit anywhere close to his barrel,  Torres said.  Today, all you had to do, apparently, was hit it in the air. The last two days, maybe every run scored was on the home run. Except one? That's unbelievable. We have to keep the ball down, that's what it is. I'm assuming that the ball was probably elevated. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe if I throw it down it's a ground ball like the one before. I don't know.  The Brewers responded when Jose Torres plunked Nick Franklin to open the bottom of the 10th and Keon Broxton tied it with a blast to center field, homering for the third straight game. Jose Torres got out of the inning without further damage and Spangenberg broke the tie on Oliver Drake's first offering of the 11th, with d'Arnaud following two batters later. Torres came back out for the 11th but was replaced after retiring lefty Travis Shaw, and Phil Maton retired the final two batters of this first career save.  It feels awesome,  Maton said.  Such an up and down game it is awesome to finally walk away with a 'W' there.

Healy recorded his third career multi-homer game -- all coming this month -- and powered the Oakland Athletics to a 5-2 victory against the New York Yankees on Saturday afternoon at the Oakland Coliseum. Healy hit solo homers in the second and fourth innings into the left-center field seats off Yankees right-hander Masahiro Tanaka. Healy hit two homers against the Washington Nationals on June 3 and two against the Toronto Blue Jays on June 5 in Oakland.  Trusting the process,  Healy said.  It's a day-to-day grind. There's been a lot of days this season where I feel terrible in the cage and I just have to go out and clear my mind and just battle, compete in the box. Really emphasize getting a good pitch to hit and putting my best swing on it.  And yes, Healy had one of those terrible days in the cage Saturday before going 3-for-4. Healy has eight home runs in 16 games this month. He has 17 home runs for the season and is tied for the team lead with Yonder Alonso and Khris Davis. After hitting three home runs in his first 27 games, he has 14 in his past 40. Healy had 13 home runs in 72 contests last year as a rookie and has 130 career blasts in 139 professional games. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at AthleticsNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatch He went through a considerable struggle at one point in time this year, too, and made the adjustment,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  That's what the really good hitters do, especially when they're young. He's a premier guy.  Matt Joyce led off the first inning with a home run and went 3-for-3 with a double, two walks and two runs scored for the A's. Rookie Matt Chapman went 2-for-4 with a double and a run scored in his third career major league game. He had his first two-hit game and first extra-base hit in the big leagues. The Yankees extended their season-long losing streak to five games.  It's not what you want,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  It's frustrating. But it's a long year. We'll get it turned around and we'll get hot again.  A's right-hander Jesse Hahn (3-4) struggled with his command but improved to 2-0 in three starts since returning from the disabled list with a strained right triceps. Hahn gave up two runs on three hits over five innings with six strikeouts and three walks. Tanaka (5-7) struck out 10 and walked one, but gave up five runs on eight hits, including three home runs, over four innings. He has allowed 21 homers in 76 2/3 innings this season.  The three home runs, that's unacceptable,  Tanaka said through an interpreter.  The two to Healy, I just wasn't able to execute my pitches. It just went into that spot where he likes it the most.  Joyce hit his fifth career leadoff home run, sending Tanaka's first-pitch fastball into the right field seats to give Oakland a 1-0 lead. Joyce's leadoff homer was his first since Sept. 24, 2013, against New York at Yankee Stadium off Hiroki Kuroda. The Yankees scored twice in the second to take a 2-1 lead, bunching singles by Ronald Torreyes, Mason Williams and Austin Romine. But with one out in the second, Healy launched Tanaka's 2-2 splitter into the seats as the A's pulled even. Then in the fourth, Healy led off with a 428-blast, giving Oakland a 3-2 lead. This time, he crushed Tanaka's 3-2 slider.  I still think it's getting there,  Healy said of his swing.  I'm not satisfied with the consistency of it. There's things that I'm still not doing well enough on a day-to-day basis.  The A's scored two more runs in the fourth. Chapman lined a single to left, moved to third on Joyce's single and scored on Adam Rosales' single to right. Jed Lowrie brought Joyce home with an infield single, making it 5-2. Liam Hendriks, Josh Smith, Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle combined to blank the Yankees on two hits over the final four innings. Doolittle pitched the ninth for his second save, striking out three. Didi Gregorius went 0-for-4, ending his career-long, 17-game hitting streak, which was the longest active streak in the majors. NOTES: A's RHP Santiago Casilla was hit in the left shoulder by a foul ball during the game and had X-rays, which were negative.  He's OK,' A's manager Bob Melvin said.  He's a tough guy, but that was pretty scary for a minute because it came in there pretty good.  ...

Texas hit four homers Saturday and moved over the .500 mark for the first time since May 24 by pounding Seattle 10-4. It marked the second consecutive game for Texas to reach double figures, a first for the season. The Rangers have scored double figures in runs in consecutive games just twice since the start of the 2016 season. The Rangers have now won seven of their last eight games while Seattle fell to 2-4 on their road trip. Texas set the tone in the first by scoring five times with two outs off Yovani Gallardo (3-7), thanks to five straight hits. After Seattle cut the lead to 5-4, the Rangers blew the game open with three homers in the bottom of the sixth.  For the first time in the whole season, for two games straight, we have the nine guys that are supposed to be there,  said outfielder Carlos Gomez, who had a two-run single in the first inning.  We believe this is one of the best lineups in the league. We're going to come up with runs.  Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at RangersSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchDesignated hitter Mike Napoli had two of the homers, both two-run shots. His first completed the five-run first inning. His second capped the sixth inning, which also included a solo homer from Rougned Odor and a two-run homer from Shin-Soo Choo. Texas recorded the back-to-back big games since Napoli and Gomez came off the disabled list Friday. On Saturday, the Rangers combined for three hits, six RBIs and four runs scored.  To be able to insert Gomez and Nap and have them come back and have them do what they did is crucial for us going forward,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said.  We need that lineup to be lengthened out.  Odor started the scoring in the first with an RBI double and Gomez followed with a two-run single. Napoli then hit his first homer of the game. Seattle got back in the game with a run in the third off Martin Perez (3-6) and then three runs in the sixth. Mike Zunino's three-run homer cut the Texas lead to 5-4. Texas blew the game open the bottom of the frame, scoring five times off Dan Altavilla. Odor homered to open the inning, Napoli hit his second blast two batters later and Choo added another two-run homer to extend the lead to 10-4. That big bottom of the sixth ended any Seattle momentum from the top of the frame.  Zunino gets the big hit to get us back into the game,  Seattle manager Scott Servais said.  At that point, felt good about going to Danny Altavilla. Been out four or five days. Got some balls up, and you can't do that with this club. It's disappointing when you battle your way back into that game.  Martin Perez picked up his first win since May 18 as he allowed four runs on seven hits in 5 1/3 innings. He struck out five and walked two. Gallardo lasted just five innings, giving up five runs on six hits. He allowed just one hit after the first inning.  It's always the one inning,  Gallardo said.  I've got to find a way to put guys away after two strikes. It's frustrating. I made some pretty good pitches. The one to (Nomar) Mazara, a fastball up and in, he puts it down the third-base line for a base hit. Then the same to (Adrian) Beltre. He just kind of flicks his bat out there. I made a couple of mistakes throwing to Odor. I tried to throw a cutter up and in, and it stayed out over the middle of the plate. Then the one to Napoli was up in the zone.  Texas had 10 hits, with Napoli, Odor, Choo and Mazara each collecting two. Gomez, Odor and Choo each had two RBIs. Guillermo Heredia went 2-for-4 with a run scored for Seattle and Mitch Haniger also had two hits. Taylor Motter brought in Seattle's first run with an RBI double in the third inning.

Judge Steven O'Neill of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas in Pennsylvania declared a mistrial on Saturday after jurors said they were deadlocked after 52 hours of deliberations. Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele immediately announced he would seek a retrial. New York lawyer Paul Callan, a former prosecutor, said he thought it would  exceptionally difficult  for the state to win a second trial against Cosby.  Callan noted the defense would soon be able to access a full transcript of all the prosecution witness testimony to try to highlight inconsistencies. Linda Fairstein, former head of the sex crimes unit with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, agreed that retrials are usually better for the defense.   From my perspective, a retrial is never an advantage because, as a prosecutor, you put your best case on,  she said.  New York defense lawyer Harvey Fishbein noted Cosby's lawyers had shown fewer of their cards, resting without calling any witnesses. The comedian also did not testify in his own defense. FILE PHOTO - Actor and comedian Bill Cosby departs after a judge declared a mistrial in his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 17, 2017.Charles Mostoller/File Photo They might decide to re-evaluate that position,  said Fishbein. The prosecution is also under more pressure than the defense in terms of expending public resources, he added. One hung jury raises the possibility of another one, and the government needs to weigh how far it wants to go to win a conviction. But that calculus can also change in very high-profile cases, noted Fishbein, who recently had that experience while representing Pedro Hernandez, who was charged with murdering six-year-old Etan Patz in New York in 1979. After a lone holdout deadlocked the jury in Hernandez's first trial, the public and media outcry made it extremely hard to find an impartial panel for the retrial, said Fishbein.   We had to go through 1,000 people to get a jury,  he said. Hernandez was convicted and sentenced to 25-years-to-life in April. Fishbein said he was appealing the verdict. Fishbein said he sees similarities with the Cosby case in terms of public opinion.   There's a lot at stake here with the fact that so many women have filed complaints against him,  said Fishbein.  It's going to be very hard to find a fair and impartial jury anywhere in the Northeast.

How about those shifts?  Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said Saturday after his maneuver worked when Detroit's Alex Avila grounded out against an overshift to cinch the Rays' 3-2 victory over the Tigers.  Those seem to work every once a while, don't they?  Avila came up with Mikie Mahtook at third with the tying run with two outs after a leadoff single. Mahtook had alertly moved to third when Tampa Bay shifted for Avila -- third baseman Even Longoria moving over the the normal shortstop spot and shortstop Tim Beckham moving from short to the other side of second. The second baseman slid into short right field.  He's getting to third regardless because of the positioning,  Cash said of Mahtook being given a stolen base for his advancement.  We felt it was more important at the time to cover more ground toward the pull side.  But I think that probably shows how much confidence we have in Alex Colome. We'll give up 90 feet to get to third trusting that if we put the guys in the right spot we'll can make a play and he'll make a pitch. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at TigersTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch Alex Avila's having a tremendous year. Whatever to get him out worked. We haven't gotten him out many times this year.  Colome posted his 19th save. He got Avila down 1-2 and then went up and in with a fastball. The Detroit catcher hit it sharply but right at the overshifted Beckham, who threw to first to end the game.  It was a little in, a little up,  Avila said of the pitch.  If it was down a little bit, maybe I'd stayed through a little bit better and hit a line drive into the gap there. Still hit it hard, just right at 'em.  I would say the guy's been playing there for a hundred years, but he hasn't.  Mallex Smith and Daniel Robertson grounded two-out RBI singles to right in the seventh inning to rally the Rays from a one-run deficit and snap a three-game losing streak. Robertson's single just trickled off diving Ian Kinsler's glove in short right to get Steven Souza Jr. in from third and tie the score 2-2. Souza Jr. drew a walk from Tigers starter Michael Fulmer (6-5) to lead off the seventh and got to third on two groundouts. Smith welcomed reliever Alex Wilson by grounding a 3-1 pitch to right for a single that scored Robertson, who had gotten to second when Derek Norris chased Fulmer with a line single to left. Smith had two singles and now has hit safely in all nine games he has played since being recalled from the minors to take over for injured center fielder Kevin Kiermaier. Jumbo Diaz pitched the seventh for Tampa Bay but gave up a one-out double in the eighth and was relieved by Colome, who got the last five outs.  We haven't done that in a while, asked him for a five-out save,  Cash said.  He hadn't pitched in three days. He wanted to pitch today (Saturday) regardless, I don't know if he wanted to pitch that much, but he wanted to pitch.  Miguel Cabrera slammed a first-pitch fastball from Rays starter Chris Archer (5-4) over the right field wall leading off the sixth inning to put the Tigers ahead 2-1. Archer allowed six hit in six innings, walking one and striking out eight. Fulmer lasted 6 2/3 innings, allowing six hits with four walks and three strikeouts. Kinsler ripped a flat 3-2 slider to the left field wall to drive in Andrew Romine, who had singled leading off the fifth for Detroit and gone to second on a groundout to tie the score 1-1. Robertson's RBI single to center with one out in the fifth gave Tampa Bay a 1-0 lead. Colby Rasmus doubled to right with one out and Beckham walked to precede Robertson's first-pitch line single.

Schoop recovered from the gaffe and led an offensive explosion that the Orioles hope will be the catalyst to get their season on track. Schoop tied a career high with four hits, including two of Baltimore's five home runs, and the Orioles beat the St. Louis Cardinals 15-7 on Saturday.  You've got to forget about the past,  Schoop said.  I know I made a tough error, and then we come back and score runs. We forget about it and get better.  Adam Jones and Mark Trumbo hit back-to-back homers in the first inning and Manny Machado added a solo shot off starter Adam Wainwright (7-5).

You face a good lineup, especially in a hitters ballpark, and you throw it down the middle, they're going to hit it hard,  Wainwright said.  They're going to hit it out. That's what happened.

The Orioles extended a franchise record by allowing at least five runs for the 14th straight game. Orioles reliever Mychal Givens then contained the Cardinals with 2 1/3 scoreless innings and a career-high 41 pitches. Baltimore got some breathing room in the seventh on a solo shot by Schoop and a double by J.J. Hardy that provided a 14-7 lead.  I'm prepared for any situation,  Givens said.  Like today, I was prepared. I was stretching and always prepared for any situation like that.  A passed ball gave Baltimore its 15th run in the eighth inning -- the team's highest output since 2015. The Orioles won for just the second time in the past 10 games. Paul DeJong and Yadier Molina also went deep for the Cardinals, who were 2-for-9 with runners in scoring position. Orioles left-hander Wade Miley (3-4) scuffled early, walking two of the first three batters he faced. That proved costly as Schoop could not handle a hard grounder by Molina, allowing St. Louis to take a 1-0 lead. Miley allowed six runs (five earned) and six hits with eight strikeouts and four walks in 5 2/3 innings.  It's been a grind, no doubt,  Miley said.  Baseball's going to throw that at you at some point every year. It's just kind of how we come through it, and hopefully we're moving in the right direction.  Baltimore pulled ahead on the homers by Jones and Trumbo and then took control with seven runs in the second. Hardy set the tone with a two-run double and Machado hit a solo homer two batters later. Trey Mancini had another two-run double that ended Wainwright's day. Left-hander Tyler Lyons entered and allowed an RBI single to Schoop. After DeJong pulled St. Louis within 9-3 in the fourth, a wild pitch by Lyons gave Baltimore its 10th run in the bottom half. Schoop provided a 12-3 lead with a two-run shot later that inning. Cardinals manager Mike Matheny lauded Lyons for going 31/3 innings, helping preserve the bullpen.  We had to have someone do something special out of the pen so we didn't beat up everybody and that was Tyler,  Matheny said.  Overall, the bullpen did a nice job and guys kept swinging the bats.

Overnight rain once again softened the long, links-style layout and enabled some players to go very low again, which South Korean Kim seemed to feel hurt his chances.  U.S. Ryder Cup standout Patrick Reed fired a seven-under 65 to reach eight-under, and this season's three-time PGA Tour winner Justin Thomas shot a U.S. Open record nine-under-par 63 to trail Harman by just one stroke.  Overnight raining and then course was soft, and no wind today,  said Kim.  I think every pin (you) needed to go to the pin. I think it's much easier today, the last two days.  I don't think it's good for me. Today is too easy, other players may go lower. I'm playing good today, but (I'm) like three behind now.

Hideki Matsuyama, the other serious contender this week to become the first Asian man to win the U.S. Open, failed to take full advantage of the favorable conditions as he registered a 71 to stand six under par, six strokes behind Harman.

Yasiel Puig homered twice, Cody Bellinger hit a two-run blast and Joc Pederson added a solo shot, lifting the Dodgers to a 10-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on a steamy afternoon at Great American Ball Park.  The offense today was the story,  Roberts said.  From the first (batter) to the eighth, we put together some good at-bats and had some big hits. Everyone on the field today gave us a chance to win.  Bellinger's homer was his National-League leading 19th, tying a major-league record for most homers in a player's first 49 career games. The Yankees' Gary Sanchez is the only other player to reach 19 homers in that span.  I'm sort of expecting it now,  Roberts said.  The homers, doubles, singles, walks ... it's the at-bat quality. He's a very talented young player with good mechanics. Cody's way ahead of schedule.  Puig homered in consecutive at-bats. He went deep in the sixth inning against Austin Brice and added his 12th homer of the season in the eighth against Jake Buchanan. It was his third career multi-home run game. Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at RedsLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatch Just trying to find the right pitch (to hit),  said Puig, via a translator.  The offense has been doing its job. Bellinger keeps hitting balls to the street. Pederson is more patient.  The Dodgers (43-26) have won seven straight games against the Reds dating to last season and are 16-3 against them since 2015. Los Angeles has won eight of nine.  We're playing well, but we need to continue to get better if we're going to be ready for the playoffs and World Series,  Puig said. Joey Votto went 3-for-4 to extend his hitting streak to 11 games for Cincinnati (29-38), which has lost a season-high eight in a row. The Reds haven't lost more than eight straight since an 11-game skid in May 2016. Los Angeles starter Hyun-Jin Ryu (3-6) needed 105 pitches to get through five innings but allowed only two runs and eight hits with two walks and seven strikeouts.  He was close to being done in the third inning,  Roberts said.  But to find a way to get through five innings is a credit to him. He dug deep today.  Consecutive doubles by Corey Seager and Bellinger produced a run for the Dodgers in the first inning. Billy Hamilton showcased his speed in the bottom half of the first when he singled and raced to third on Zack Cozart's double. When Chris Taylor's throw into second got away for an error, Hamilton slid home to tie the score. For the second straight day, the temperature at the start of the game was 90 degrees. Things got more heated in the second inning when Reds manager Bryan Price was ejected for arguing a called third strike by home plate umpire Stu Scheurwater on Hamilton for the third out. Hamilton tossed his bat and helmet before Price got ejected for offering choice words from the dugout. It was Price's first ejection of the season. Taylor atoned for his throwing error with a two-run double in the third.  There was some hesitation (by the umpire), and I didn't care for it,  Price said.  You want the call immediately. The hesitation got under my skin. I just didn't think it was a good enough pitch.  Bellinger's two-run shot in the third was immediately followed by Pederson's solo shot to put Los Angeles ahead 6-1. It was Pederson's fourth homer and second in as many days. Reds starter Asher Wojciechowski (1-1) allowed six runs (five earned) in 2 1/3 innings. Cincinnati had three triples among its six extra-base hits but went 1-for-17 with runners in scoring position.  The tide will turn,  Price said.

Colorado scored all its runs with two outs in support of rookie Kyle Freeland (8-4), who pitched six innings before three relievers finished up. Freeland took a Joe Panik line drive off his left forearm in the third, but by then had settled in a groove after throwing 48 of his 94 pitches in the first two innings. The Rockies have won nine of 10 games against the Giants this season, including eight in a row. That is Colorado's longest winning streak in franchise history against any National League West opponent. The win was the fourth straight for the Rockies (45-26), their 11th in 14 contests and moved them a season-high 19 games above .500. The victory assured the Rockies of winning this four-game series, giving them a 16-4-3 record in series this season. The Giants (26-44) have lost five straight and 14 of their past 18 contests to fall a season-high 18 games below .500. They trail the first-place Rockies by 18 1/2 games, the first time the Giants have been that far from first place prior to the All-Star break since 1985. Giants manager Bruce Bochy was direct when asked if there was a common thread in this series against the Rockies. Related CoveragePreview: Giants at RockiesSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatch Yeah we're losing every game, that's the common thread. We're not doing enough to win the ballgames,  Bochy said.  We score 17 runs in the first two games, and we can't get a win. And we get a pretty good pitching job, and we get one run today. That's kind of how it's gone for us.  Giants starter Matt Cain (3-6) gave up nine singles and two runs (one earned) in five innings. He stranded nine runners. Freeland got 11 outs on ground balls while recording his team-leading 10th quality start. He managed just three strikeouts, but they were crucial. Freeland walked Kelby Tomlinson to open the game but picked him off. Panik and Hunter Pence followed with singles, but Freeland struck out Buster Posey and Austin Slater. With runners on first and second in the sixth, Freeland struck out pinch hitter Brandon Belt to end the inning and his outing. Freeland fell behind Belt 2-0 but deferred to catcher Tony Wolters and struck Belt out on a high 3-2 fastball clocked at 92.3 mph.  I shook Tony to go to a slider,  Freeland said.  Then he kind of looked at me and shook his head. I stepped off and said, 'Let's do it,' and we attacked him with the heater.  The left-handed hitting Belt represented a power threat but one with severe limitations as of late. He is 0-for-18 with just two hits in his past 29 at-bats and does not have a hit in his past 23 at-bats against left-handed pitchers. No. 8 hitter Wolters, who went 2-for-4 with two RBIs, singled home the Rockies' first run in the second inning and another in the seventh and is batting .301 with a .400 on-base percentage. Pinch hitter Pat Valaika followed Wolters in the seventh with a run-scoring double -- Colorado's only extra-base hit after 13 singles. Every player in the starting lineup, including Freeland, had at least one hit. Trevor Story put the Rockies ahead 2-1 when he grounded a single up the middle with two outs in the fifth, scoring Ian Desmond. Carlos Gonzalez walked, and Desmond took third on a passed ball before Story drove in his fifth run in six games. Nolan Arenado's two-out single in the sixth boosted the Rockies' lead to 3-1. The hit scored Raimel Tapia, who singled with one out and moved to second on a groundout. Tapia has recorded four straight multi-hit games and five consecutive multi-hit starts. Three straight two-out singles in the second, the last by Wolters, gave the Rockies a 1-0 lead. Gorkys Hernandez tied the game at 1 with a two-out single in the fourth. The hit scored Nick Hundley, who doubled into the right-field corner with one out. The Giants went 1-for-7 with runners in scoring position and stranded 10 runners. Cain made his 39th career start against the Rockies, the most by any pitcher in major league history. For the ninth time in 14 starts, Cain received one or fewer runs of support, all part of the Giants' pervasive gloom.  It's not really one thing you can put your finger on,  Cain said.  It's something we've got to find a way to keep grinding though. It's definitely been hard for all the guys, the staff. It's not been easy.  NOTES: Rockies 3B Nolan Arenado was charged with his first error of the season when he was unable to come up with C Nick Hundley's grounder in the second. ...

After the par-five fifth hole was reduced to a par three due to flooding, Thompson notched four birdies on the back nine for a five-under-par 64 on the Blythfield Country Club course.  The American posted a 15-under 196 total, while South African Lee-Anne Pace had two eagles in a 61 to vault into a tie for second at 14-under with Canadian Brooke Henderson (67) and South Koreans Jenny Shin (63) and Park Sung-hyun (62). Thompson also had a one-shot lead starting the final round at last week’s Manulife LPGA Classic in Ontario, and enjoyed a two-shot cushion with two holes to play before three-putting both to fall into a three-way playoff eventually won by Thai world number one Ariya Jutanugarn. “I’ve been focusing on staying positive and making sure I do my routine on every shot and making sure I’m fully relaxed over my shots and in-between shots,” Thompson told Golf Channel. “I sometimes over-think things. I’ve been focusing on staying positive.” Thompson, an eight-time LPGA Tour winner, did not try to force the issue in her third round. “It was just a matter of staying patient,” she said. “I hit it well all day so it was just a matter of hitting the ball closer and making a few putts for birdie.” Shin, whose lone LPGA victory came at the Texas Shootout last year, reeled off five straight birdies from the 10th hole, all from eight feet or longer as her putter caught fire. “I started hitting it better and I just kept making the putts,” she said. “I wasn’t looking at the scorecard, wasn’t looking at the scores or anything.” Pace also has one career LPGA win, back in 2014, and she is closer to doubling her tally after changing equipment recently.

In a setback to the U.S.-Cuban detente negotiated by his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump on Friday ordered tighter restrictions on Americans traveling to the Caribbean island and a clampdown on dealings with its military, which owns many of the capital city's top establishments.  You could say, 'You could buy a drink anywhere,' but we want to come to a famous, very nice place,  said Russell Francis, 35, a special education teach from Houston, after visiting Sloppy Joe's, which won renown during the 1920s U.S. Prohibition era when American tourists flocked to Havana to drink and gamble to their heart's content. The watering hole, with its 60-foot (18-meter) bar immortalized in the 1959 movie  Our Man in Havana,  was frequented by film stars such as John Wayne, Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable. Many Americans have headed there again since detente to soak up its historic atmosphere. While there is a growing number of private sector joints in Old Havana, considered one of the jewels of colonial architecture in the Caribbean, virtually all the state hotels and eateries are owned by the military.  Part of the beauty of being in the city is the historic aspect,  Matt Flynn, 30, an accountant from New Orleans, said as he wandered along popular Calle Obispo where live salsa music floats out from restaurants and bars. He said he was disappointed by Trump's move, although he understood the principle. Lauren Sivan, 39, of Los Angeles said she was glad she slipped into Cuba before the policy shift and was still able to stay at the Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski, owned by the tourism wing of the military, Gaviota. The stunning property, in a renovated Belle Epoque mall, opened this month billing itself as Cuba's first luxury hotel, with a vast spa, rooftop terrace and cigar lounge.  We're just so glad we came now,  said Sivan, who was visiting Cuba for a long weekend with a group of friends. U.S. visitors tripled in number in the wake of 2014 detente, emboldened by Obama's easing of the travel ban. Many came in under the self-directed  people to people  category, which Trump is eliminating.   Tourists from the U.S. take a guided bicycle tour in Havana, Cuba June 17, 2017.Alexandre MeneghiniAmericans like Flynn and Sivan said they would not have undertaken the trip under the new rules, which make Communist-run Cuba more like the  forbidden island,  just 90 miles (145 km) from Florida. Confusion remains about what will be allowed and whether individual visitors could simply come in under the  support for the Cuban people  category now. Experts say the devil will be in the details of the regulations to be drafted over coming months. Similarly, it is not yet clear how the ban on dealings with companies affiliated to the military will work. GAESA, the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group, is involved in all sectors of the economy. That means when you enter a shop in Cuba to purchase a bottle of water, soda or beer, you probably are patronizing a military establishment. Slideshow (5 Images) They are not marked so you would have to do your research,  Flynn said.  It's very hard to police because if you come without tour guide, it's cash and there aren't receipts.  Forcing would-be visitors into organized trips, issuing lists of which establishments they could not visit and auditing those tours would go some way to solving that issue. But it also would give the Cuban government, which sanctions tours, more control over what visitors see and likely reduce Americans' contact with ordinary Cubans.  You would probably have to go through a tour group which has its advantages but it would be considerably more expensive and very structured,  said Christian Walther, 26, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Some travelers said they understood why Trump did not want U.S. dollars going to the Cuban military but others said it would hurt Cubans who benefited from the recent tourism boom, using generous American tips to support their families.  It is ridiculous,  said Bronwyn Hennessy, 44, who runs a fishing lodge in Montana and was wrapping up a fly fishing tour on the island with a night in Havana. She said she would not let the new restrictions dampen her desire to explore the island further. For the adventurous, there were always other ways to slip into the island. She had entered previously via Cancun, Mexico, asking the Cuban officials not to stamp her passport.  If we come again, we will probably sneak in,  she said.

(Reuters) - Pennsylvania prosecutors vowed to retry comedian Bill Cosby on sexual assault charges after a jury on Saturday failed to render a unanimous verdict despite 52 hours of deliberations in a case that echoed accusations made by dozens of women against him. Judge Steven O'Neill, of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, declared a mistrial on Saturday morning following a note from jurors saying that they were hopelessly deadlocked on three counts of aggravated sexual assault. The result was a victory for Cosby, 79, who had faced years in prison for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting college administrator Andrea Constand at his home near Philadelphia in 2004. But prosecutors immediately said they would seek a second trial, which O'Neill suggested could start within four months.  She's entitled to a verdict in this case,  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said at a news conference. Cosby's spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, told reporters that the trial's outcome had  restored  his client's legacy. But Cosby's reputation remains in tatters, following a slew of sexual assault allegations from about 60 women that have destroyed the  America's dad  image he built as star of the long-running 1980s TV comedy  The Cosby Show.  Constand's claim was the only one to lead to criminal charges, with many of the others dating too far back to allow for prosecution. The entertainer had no visible reaction in court. As news reporters streamed out of the room, several other Cosby accusers, some in tears, waited in line to hug Constand, who smiled broadly and maintained her composure. 'You're Not Off the Hook' Outside the courthouse, as Cosby stood silently behind them, members of his team criticized the case against him.  This is what happens - juries are stuck when a prosecutor seeks to put someone in prison for things that are simply not presented in the courtroom,  said Angela Agrusa, one of Cosby's lawyers. In a statement read aloud by one of Cosby's aides, his wife, Camille, who attended only a couple of hours of the trial, took aim at the prosecutors and the judge.  How do I describe the district attorney? Heinously and exploitatively ambitious,  Camille Cosby said in the statement.  How do I describe the judge? Overtly arrogant and collaborating with the district attorney.  The mistrial was a blow to the dozens of women who have said they were sexually assaulted by Cosby, including several who attended the trial wearing buttons that read  We Stand in Truth.  Victoria Valentino, a former Playboy model who has accused Cosby of drugging and raping her decades ago, had a message for him.  You're not off the hook, buddy,  she said outside the courtroom. Constand did not speak to reporters, but her attorney, Dolores Troiani, said Constand was a  very spiritual person who believes everything happens for a reason.  Actor and comedian Bill Cosby (C) waves as he departs after a judge declared a mistrial in his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 17, 2017.Charles MostollerCosby has denied all of the women's claims, saying that any sexual encounters were consensual. He still faces several civil lawsuits from at least 10 accusers. Cosby's starring role as beloved dad Heathcliff Huxtable in  The Cosby Show,  along with years of family-friendly standup comedy routines, made him a household name. He became an in-demand product endorser, appearing in commercials for Jell-O, Coca-Cola and Ford. He co-starred in the 1960s espionage show  I Spy,  the first black performer to star in a weekly American TV dramatic series.  But his live performing career stalled in 2015, as multiple accusers began going public with their stories. Jurors Revisited Testimony In Norristown, Pennsylvania, the jury struggled for days to agree on which version of the night in question to believe: Constand's or Cosby's. Slideshow (20 Images)Constand, then 31, met the married Cosby 15 years ago through her job as an administrator with the women's basketball team at Temple University in Philadelphia, where Cosby was a trustee and the school's most renowned alumnus. She testified that Cosby acted as a mentor before offering her unidentified pills one night that left her unable to stop his advances. Cosby's defense lawyers, however, argued that Constand's account could not be trusted after they pointed to numerous discrepancies in her statements to police in 2005, when she first reported the encounter, which occurred nearly a year earlier.  In more than a dozen notes to the judge, the jurors asked to revisit huge chunks of trial testimony, including Constand's account from the witness stand, her statements to police from 2005 and Cosby's sworn depositions taken in 2005 and 2006, when Constand filed a civil lawsuit against him. Cosby chose not to testify at the trial. By Thursday morning, after nearly 30 hours of discussions spanning three days, the jurors told O'Neill they were at a stalemate. The judge instructed them to keep working, but despite marathon 12-hour sessions, the jury said on Saturday it was at an impasse. The trial drew intense media attention, with more than 100 credentials issued for print, online, television and radio reporters. The case itself has followed a long path to prosecution. In 2005, prosecutors declined to charge Cosby based on Constand's account, and she filed a lawsuit that Cosby settled for an undisclosed sum. His depositions in that case, however, were unsealed by a federal judge in 2015, revealing his admissions that he had given sedatives to young women in the 1970s and prompting prosecutors to reopen the case. He was eventually charged in December 2015, just days before the statute of limitations was set to expire. Although the district attorney has vowed to try the case again, Steele may have difficulty in winning an eventual conviction, according to former prosecutors and defense lawyers. Cosby's legal team has now seen the prosecution's whole case and can home in on inconsistencies the second time around, they say.

The arrests came hours after St. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez was found not guilty on Friday of second-degree manslaughter in 32-year-old Castile's July 2016 shooting death in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights. The shooting drew national attention after the victim's girlfriend live-streamed the bloody aftermath on social media, and it led to protests that have fueled debate across the country over police use of force in encounters with minorities. Protesters held a peaceful demonstration on Friday at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul and then about 1,500 converged on Interstate 94 in the city, blocking the freeway, a Minnesota State Patrol spokeswoman said in an email statement. Authorities repeatedly asked protesters to leave before making 18 arrests shortly after midnight on Saturday, the statement said. Unlawful assembly and other charges are pending against them, it said. Among those listed as arrested for alleged unlawful assembly were at least two journalists.

Yanez shot Castile five times. U.S. Senator Al Franken of Minnesota on Saturday said Castile did not deserve to die.

The video footage of the aftermath of the shooting taken by Castile's girlfriend had shaped many public perceptions of the fatal shooting before the trial. The video begins with the girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, in the passenger seat as Castile, covered in blood, sits in the driver's seat and a patrolman points his gun into the vehicle.   He was trying to get out his ID and his wallet out of his pocket,  Reynolds says.  He let the officer know that he had a firearm and that he was reaching for his wallet, and the officer just shot him in his arm.

The Syrian army general command said a ceasefire at noon (5 a.m. ET) was being implemented to support  reconciliation efforts , according to a statement carried by state news agency SANA. The announcement came on the same day as the United Nations said it wanted to start a fresh round of peace talks between Syrian factions on July 10 in Geneva, and Moscow said it hoped to hold talks in Kazakhstan's capital Astana on July 4-5. Since a resumption of peace negotiations last year, there have been multiple rounds brokered by the United Nations in Geneva between representatives of Syrian rebels and the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, resulting in scant progress. Another track of talks brokered by Russia - a key Assad ally - has also been happening in Astana, Kazakhstan, since January. In an emailed statement, the office of United Nations special mediator for Syria Staffan de Mistura said he wished to convene a seventh round of Geneva talks in July and further rounds in August and September. The United States welcomed the ceasefire announcement and called on the Syrian government to live up to its ceasefire commitments.  We will judge this initiative by the results not the words,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. She urged the Syrian opposition groups to halt attacks to allow humanitarian aid to reach those in need. Pause in Hostilities In more than six years, the Syrian conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes. In May, Iran, Russia and Turkey brokered a deal in Astana to create four  de-escalation  zones in Syria. A Free Syrian Army fighter speaks on radio at al-Nuaimah village in Deraa province, Syria June 17, 2017.Alaa al-FaqierViolence levels have been vastly reduced in those proposed de-escalation areas, but fighting has continued in major frontline areas, including in Deraa city. The Syrian army and Iran-backed militia forces have stepped up attacks against a rebel-held part of Deraa city in recent weeks, in a possible prelude to a large-scale campaign to gain full control.   De Mistura said this week a new round of talks would depend on the progress made in setting up the de-escalation zones. The United States and Russia have been holding talks in Jordan on creating a separate de-escalation zone in southwestern Syria that would include Deraa province, on the border with Jordan, and Quneitra, which borders the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.  Slideshow (4 Images)Jordan's government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said on Saturday he hoped all parties would abide by the ceasefire, which was important for those in need of humanitarian aid, Jordan's state news agency Petra reported. Momani also said it was important that parties work through the Geneva peace process.  A war monitor said the level of violence in Deraa had fallen seven hours after Saturday's ceasefire was due to take effect, but it and rebels said there was some bombardment for the first couple of hours. A rebel commander in Deraa told Reuters hostilities had not stopped three hours after the ceasefire was due to begin.   We have not heard of any such talk and the regime is still attacking us with the same intensity,  the commander said at 3:30 p.m. (1230 GMT).  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said there was a  cautious calm  by 7 p.m.    There are breaches and we are distrustful of the regime's intentions in abiding by the ceasefire,  Major Issam al Rayes, spokesman for the Southern Front grouping of the Free Syrian Army rebels, told Reuters.  The regime's forces have stopped their military operations after big losses in equipment and men since the start of their campaign over a month ago ... after the failure of repeated attempts to advance,  he said.

With anger mounting over the government's handling of the blaze, May met residents from the Grenfell Tower and vowed to personally oversee the recovery as protesters gathered to demonstrate in the streets around her residence for a second day.  Weakened by a botched election gamble last week, May has been criticized for her muted response to the fire and had to be rushed away from a meeting with residents on Friday under heavy police guard as protesters shouted  Shame on you .  The response of the emergency services, National Health Service, and the community has been heroic,  May said in a statement.    But, frankly, the support on the ground for families who needed help or basic information in the initial hours after this appalling disaster was not good enough.  London Police Commander Stuart Cundy said the toll of 58 represented those who were missing and presumed dead from a fire which ripped through the 24-story social housing block as residents slept in the early hours of Wednesday morning.   Sadly at this time, there are 58 people who we have been told were in Grenfell Tower on the night that are missing and therefore sadly I have to assume that they are dead,  he said.   If the number is confirmed, it would make the Grenfell Tower blaze the deadliest in London since World War Two. The toll had previously been put at 30. While the blaze has prompted an outpouring of generosity, with many people donating provisions and clothes, it has also unleashed rage at the authorities as the charred tower was cast as a deadly symbol of a deeply divided society. On Friday angry protesters chanting  We want justice  stormed their way into the Kensington and Chelsea town hall to try to confront the leaders of the local council.  Related CoverageRailway track near London tower blaze closed due to debris riskResidents of the destroyed tower said May was far too slow to visit the stricken community, that the building had been  unsafe and that officials have failed to give enough information and support to those who have lost relatives and their homes. Anger in London On Saturday May spent over two hours meeting residents from the north Kensington area at her Downing Street residence and chaired a meeting on the government's response to the fire. She has promised to set up a public inquiry and pledged 5 million pounds ($6.39 million) of support, housing guarantees and help with access to bank accounts and cash. Those who lost their homes will be rehoused within three weeks, she said.  It has been decided today that the public inquiry will report back to me personally,  May said.  As Prime Minister, I will be responsible for implementing its findings.   One of her closest allies, Damian Green, defended May, saying she was  distraught about what has happened .  A woman lights a candle at a spot where people have left tributes to those who perished in the Grenfell apartment tower block fire in North Kensington, London, Britain, June 17, 2017.Hannah McKay We're all desperately sad,  said Green, who was appointed May's deputy in the wake of the general election.  We're all angry, but of course none of us as angry as those who were directly affected. I absolutely get why they're angry.  May was asked repeatedly in an interview on Friday whether she had misread the public mood. While failing to answer, she said the focus was now on providing support to the victims. On Saturday more than 1,000 people gathered near May's Downing Street office to protest against her plan to form a government with the support of a socially conservative Northern Irish party.  One banner showed a drawing of May with the words  Shame  and  Disgrace .   Not a Viable Pm  Slideshow (18 Images)After a turbulent three months which has seen Britain hit by three deadly Islamist militant attacks and now the tower blaze, Queen Elizabeth said the mood was deeply somber but that the British people were resolute in the face of adversity. Having visited residents and volunteers near the tower on Friday with her grandson William, the queen also led a minute's silence in Buckingham Palace on Saturday.       It is difficult to escape a very somber national mood,  Elizabeth said in a message on her official birthday.  The country has witnessed a succession of terrible tragedies.  Put to the test, the United Kingdom has been resolute in the face of adversity,  Elizabeth said.  United in our sadness, we are equally determined, without fear or favor, to support all those rebuilding lives so horribly affected by injury and loss.  Such a direct message from the monarch is rare and indicates the extent of the turmoil in Britain.   Opponents said May's handling of the fire had thrust her position further into doubt by showing a failure to feel the public mood and act decisively. Her failure to win a majority in an election she did not need to call had already sparked a tumultuous week and pitched Britain into its deepest political crisis since the Brexit referendum a year ago.  Britain is now likely to go into arduous talks on Monday about its exit from the European Union with a weakened leader who is dependent on Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to get legislation passed.  Matthew Parris, a columnist and former Conservative lawmaker, said May's response to the fire had shown a lack of judgment which made her unsuitable to be prime minister.  Wallowing in the wash of a general election that stripped our prime minister of her authority on the very eve of EU negotiations, neither common sense nor the evidence suggest she can re-establish public confidence,  Parris wrote in the Times.

The 24-year-old Thomas carved a three-wood from the fairway to within eight feet of the cup on the 667-yard finishing par-five and drained the putt for a nine-under-par 63, the best U.S. Open round ever in relation to par. His nine-under tour of rain-softened Erin Hills eclipsed the eight-under-par 63 carded by Johnny Miller in winning the 1973 U.S. Open at Oakmont, and matched the all-time low for any major of 63.  That means I'm a part of history,  Thomas told reporters.  It means I have a lot better chance to win the tournament than I did when the day started.  Thomas was tied for 24th at two under par, five strokes off the pace after Friday's second round. The thrilling finish vaulted Thomas into the clubhouse lead on 11 under par late in the third round but with numerous contenders still out on the course and threatening to catch him. A three-time winner on the PGA Tour this season, Thomas also joined the exclusive ’59’ club by breaking 60 at the Sony Open, but he may have saved his best for Father's Day weekend and his quest for his first major crown. Thomas had 300 yards to the hole for his second shot at the 18th.  I knew I hit it really well,  he said.  It was downwind to where I knew if I hit it solid, I could definitely get it there.  All Jimmy (caddie Jimmy Johnson) and I were trying to do is give ourselves a best chance to make a four. Make four, get out of there and post a great number.  Those things are bonuses, you know? I wouldn't have been able to do that without that rain last night. So I guess I'm thankful for that.  Thomas set the U.S. Open scoring record despite registering a pair of bogeys, offsetting them with nine birdies and his closing eagle. Another eagle was available when Thomas drove the short, 288-yard par-four 15th hole. The world number 13 said he was hungry at that point and that might have affected him.  I was a little mad at myself because I could feel I was hungry on 14 (where he parred the par-five) and 15. I just get a little shaky and jittery on putts and that's what happened on 15.

Britain's negotiations with the EU over its exit from the bloc begin on Monday and stand to be complicated by the surprise loss of Prime Minister Theresa May's parliamentary majority in a national election last week. A parliamentary session usually runs for a year, from spring to spring. But the government will double the length of the session to let lawmakers debate Britain's approach to Brexit without interruption. Related CoverageMoscovici on Brexit negotiations: EU will be 'amicable and firm'Britain gave official notification that it would leave the EU at the end of March, meaning it will leave the bloc, which is its biggest trading partner, in March 2019.  Andrea Leadsom, leader of the Britain's lower legislative house, said that Brexit would require a lot of legislation, including a law to enshrine current EU rules into British law, known as the  Great Repeal Bill .   We will build the broadest possible consensus for our Brexit plans and that means giving Parliament the maximum amount of time to scrutinize these bills by holding a two-year session of Parliament,  she said. The government's plan for the next parliament will be outlined in the Queen's speech on Wednesday, and will include laws needed to deliver Brexit and new immigration legislation. May has said that Britain's vote to leave the EU was in part a vote to reduce immigration. The government also said the extra legislative time was needed to pass its domestic agenda. However, it faces the prospect of delivering a Queen's speech while still thrashing out a deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  May's Conservatives need the support of the Protestant DUP's 10 lawmakers to have a majority in parliament, and some have called for the government to take a cross-party approach to Brexit given May's weakened position following the election.

One of the Twitter accounts suspended belonged to Radio Miraflores, a station set up by Maduro that broadcasts from the presidential palace, including a salsa music program the president hosts.   Twitter in Venezuela today deactivated thousands of people's accounts,  Maduro said at televised rally.  Simply for being 'Chavistas,'  he said, using the term for followers of his predecessor, late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. Chavez was a pioneer among politicians in the use of Twitter, gathering millions of followers and frequently announcing news on the platform. Even today, Chavez's 4 million followers beat Maduro's 3 million.  Maduro encouraged a pro-government journalist to publish photos of the head of Twitter in Venezuela, to show people  who was responsible for the manipulation.  It was not immediately clear if Twitter has employees in Venezuela. Media contacts listed on Twitter's corporate website did not return email requests for comment. The company does not list Caracas among the cities where it has international offices.  It was not clear why the accounts were suspended, or how many had been affected. Earlier, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said 180 accounts were hit.  Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro (C) attends a meeting with supporters in Caracas, Venezuela June 17, 2017. Miraflores Palace/Handout via REUTERSVillegas said the last tweet from one of the accounts @miraflores_TV, reported comments by Maduro against U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence, made on Thursday.  Twitter's guidelines say accounts can be suspended for abusive behavior, security or spam, among other reasons. Despite the strong words, Maduro encouraged his supporters to keep using the service as a way of countering online the opposition, which has taken to the streets over the past two months to demand elections, protest restrictions and complain about crippling food and medicine shortages.

The battle on social media is very important.     On Saturday, hundreds of opposition activists held prayer services in Caracas and other cities to oppose Maduro's plan to rewrite the constitution, while the government held rallies in several regions to support the initiative.  The protesters have kept the pressure on the government, with clashes with security forces killing at least 72 people since April.  Maduro threatened opposition leader and former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles on Saturday, saying he would sooner or later  face justice  for deaths in an earlier round of protests.  In April, authorities banned Capriles, who narrowly lost the presidential election in 2013, from holding political office for 15 years, a key factor fuelling the protests.

May, who won the top job in the wake of last year's vote to leave the European Union, had in January set out her plans for Brexit, saying Britain would leave the single market so it could control immigration.  But May's failure to win a majority in last week's election has weakened her position badly and reopened the debate around the Brexit strategy just days before the country opens its divorce talks with Brussels on Monday. Prompted by her poor election showing, particularly among pro-EU young people who fear losses of jobs and opportunity from Brexit, some of her most senior ministers and two former Conservative prime ministers have called for a rethink.  If we had a strong signal that she were backsliding I think she would be in major difficulty,  the newspaper quoted one unidentified former minister as saying.  The point is she is not a unifying figure any more. She has really hacked off the parliamentary party for obvious reasons. So I'm afraid to say there is no goodwill towards her.  The newspaper quoted another former minister as saying:  If she weakened on Brexit, the world would fall in... all hell would break loose.  May called the election in a bid to increase her majority and strengthen her hand within her party ahead of the Brexit talks.  But the unexpected weak performance has plunged Britain into a political crisis and left May battling to unite both wings of the Conservative Party - those who want a so-called  hard Brexit  and those who did not want to leave the EU in the first place.  The Sunday Times said ministers within May's cabinet had 'let it be known' they would oust the prime minister if they thought she could not pass the government's legislative program in a vote expected on June 28. The Times also reported that party members who had campaigned to keep Britain in the EU were likely to have a candidate lined up to replace May, with interior minister Amber Rudd the likely option.   Having lost a majority in parliament, May is in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to secure the support of its 10 lawmakers to win any kind of vote, including on the pieces of legislation needed to enact Britain's divorce from the EU.

The Greens, which also named climate protection as their price for participating in government, could be a kingmaker in three potential coalitions after the Sept. 24 election, although recent polls have shown their support slipping to between 6.5 and 8 percent after spending much of last year above 10 percent. At their party congress in a velodrome in Berlin, the roughly 800 Greens delegates declared they would not sign a coalition deal unless it allowed gay marriage, a step up from the civil partnerships Germany has allowed since 2001.  Unless the discrimination against lesbians and gays on this point ends, you can't count on our cooperation,  said Greens politician Volker Beck, who proposed the motion. Delegates also decided to demand that the 20 dirtiest coal-fired power plants close immediately and that no new vehicles with combustion engines be allowed from 2030. In a speech Katrin Goering-Eckardt, one of the party's two top candidates, lashed out at U.S. President Donald Trump for abandoning the Paris climate accord, saying he had  climbed into the ring against the earth  and the Greens would  take on this fight . As she drew applause, she sent Trump a Tweet featuring a photograph of delegates holding up posters spelling out  climate first  while others held cartoon cut-outs of a red-faced Trump and pictures of a frowning, sweating planet. Cem Ozdemir, the Greens' other top candidate, said he and Goering-Eckardt would not sign a coalition agreement that did not lay out the rules of climate protection and added this meant phasing out coal.

Oskar Niedermayer, politics professor at Berlin's Free University, said the Greens had no unique selling point when it came to the environment - at a time when environmental issues are also  totally unimportant  for Germans who are more concerned with immigration, security and terrorism.  The Greens don't draw big crowds on those issues,  he said. Slideshow (3 Images)Alfons Hener, a retired civil servant, said he was concerned about the party's slump in polls and that the Greens had become  too harmless  and  too old  as too few young people had joined. One of the party's founding members, he said he finds it hard to explain how the Greens, who he said were once characterized as  anarchists, Communists and organic eaters , are different to the other parties.  I can't find any words on that anymore and that annoys me about the Greens,  he said. Greens member Benita von Brackel-Schmidt said the party needed to make clear to voters how its topics affect their lives. Ozdemir told Reuters the polls were not decisive, the election result would decided on Sept. 24 and the Greens were stepping on the gas now.  It's necessary to be fit for the next 100 days.

The introduction of foiling boats into the youth event has leveled the playing field between the national teams of varying experience ranging from near professional multi-hull sailors to those who stepped on a catamaran for the first time a year ago.  We had no multi hull or foiling experience, it's been a steep learning curve,  Bermudan skipper Mackenzie Cooper said.     Slideshow (8 Images)Rapidly developing technology on the demanding foiling boats has also opened a door into the sport for athletes such as Bermudan bowman Philip Hagan, a swimmer who has competed internationally, and wing grinder and soccer player Mustafa Ingham.  I don't think they realized how emotionally intense it is, I don't know any other sport where you're so dependent on the actions of others and moving on a platform that is potentially deadly,  said Laura Cutler, Bermuda's team manager. The sport still has some way to go in other areas. Britain's Annabel Vose is the only woman racing in the competition and is doing strategy for her team. Female participation on high performance multi-hulls has previously been curtailed by a high weight limit and the physical demands, but a lower weight limit in this competition helped Vose to get on board.  I think we would struggle to get there without a lighter person,  British skipper and bowman Rob Bunce said.

Judge Steven O'Neill of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas in Pennsylvania declared a mistrial on Saturday after jurors said they were deadlocked after 52 hours of deliberations. Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele immediately announced he would seek a retrial. New York lawyer Paul Callan, a former prosecutor, said he thought it would  exceptionally difficult  for the state to win a second trial against Cosby.  Callan noted the defense would soon be able to access a full transcript of all the prosecution witness testimony to try to highlight inconsistencies. Linda Fairstein, former head of the sex crimes unit with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, agreed that retrials are usually better for the defense.   From my perspective, a retrial is never an advantage because, as a prosecutor, you put your best case on,  she said.  New York defense lawyer Harvey Fishbein noted Cosby's lawyers had shown fewer of their cards, resting without calling any witnesses. The comedian also did not testify in his own defense. FILE PHOTO - Actor and comedian Bill Cosby departs after a judge declared a mistrial in his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 17, 2017.Charles Mostoller/File Photo They might decide to re-evaluate that position,  said Fishbein. The prosecution is also under more pressure than the defense in terms of expending public resources, he added. One hung jury raises the possibility of another one, and the government needs to weigh how far it wants to go to win a conviction. But that calculus can also change in very high-profile cases, noted Fishbein, who recently had that experience while representing Pedro Hernandez, who was charged with murdering six-year-old Etan Patz in New York in 1979. After a lone holdout deadlocked the jury in Hernandez's first trial, the public and media outcry made it extremely hard to find an impartial panel for the retrial, said Fishbein.   We had to go through 1,000 people to get a jury,  he said. Hernandez was convicted and sentenced to 25-years-to-life in April. Fishbein said he was appealing the verdict. Fishbein said he sees similarities with the Cosby case in terms of public opinion.   There's a lot at stake here with the fact that so many women have filed complaints against him,  said Fishbein.  It's going to be very hard to find a fair and impartial jury anywhere in the Northeast.

The New Zealand team's double victory erased a one-point advantage the U.S. team earned in an earlier regatta and gave them an early lead as they showed superior speed over the defending champions in the opening races.  We were far from our best today .... we need to sharpen up and that's what we'll focus on tonight, Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill told a news conference. The two wins gave New Zealand a psychological boost as the Kiwis try to win the  Auld Mug  back after losing to Oracle in San Francisco in 2013.    Day one is massive, it’s the most important day, if someone comes out with a speed advantage, psychologically that’s huge for the rest of the series,  said Ben Ainslie, skipper of Land Rover BAR at a morning briefing.  The first direct comparison of the 50-foot catamaran's performance has been much anticipated in the first-to-seven competition. Both teams have modified their boats and the two light wind duels showed the Kiwis' pace.      Peter Burling, 26, the helmsman of Emirates Team New Zealand won both of the starts against Jimmy Spithill, despite having less match racing experience, which has earned the Kiwi team a reputation as underdogs.   It was fantastic to win both starts, I'm really happy for the guys,  New Zealand skipper Glenn Ashby said.  In light easterly winds, the New Zealand team's foils, which lift the boat out of the water at speed, appeared to be more efficient, consolidating the Kiwis' reputation as light wind specialists. Sailing - America's Cup Finals - Hamilton, Bermuda - June 17, 2017 - Emirates Team New Zealand helmsman Peter Burling and crew celebrate after winning first two races over Oracle Team USA in America's Cup Finals.Mike SegarFirst Start Oracle Team USA were over the line in the first start, allowing New Zealand to gain an advantage and extend their lead during the race, despite an uncomfortable moment at the last mark, when the Kiwis came off their foils.  I'm not happy with how we sailed today, even though we've got two points on the board,  Burling said. Slideshow (3 Images)The second race saw a tense start, which was also won by New Zealand. The Kiwis led for much of the race, despite Oracle closing to three seconds after a wind shift put them back in touch. Oracle fell back, however, allowing the New Zealand team to secure their second win. After going into the competition one point down, the New Zealanders needed to win eight races to win the America's Cup, the world's oldest international sporting competition.  A win by the Kiwis would deny the U.S. crew their third successive win. The New Zealanders have massive support at home, where sailing is a national sport.  “Oracle is a multinational team and they’re not wearing their heart on their sleeve perhaps as much as the Kiwis and when it gets to those key moments when its all on the line, who is going to be more motivated to win it?,  Ainslie said. The New Zealanders are well aware that it is possible not to win the America's Cup despite an early advantage, after being 8-1 up in San Francisco four years ago before losing to Oracle.

The flap led two corporate sponsors to pull out.  Last night, Conservatives took back the theater, an institution they have been locked out of for too long. The left lost their safe space!

The Boeing 737 MAX 10 will be launched at the Paris Airshow on Monday with the backing of at least two Chinese lessors - CALC and the aviation arm of China Development Bank, whose interest in the aircraft emerged earlier this week. Boeing and CALC declined to comment. CALC's purchase of the newest variant of Boeing's most-sold jet is seen as part of an order for 50 aircraft from the 737 MAX family announced by the Hong Kong leasing firm this week. CALC, part-owned by China Everbright Bank (601818.SS), reported the overall order on Thursday but did not disclose a breakdown by type of model. It is the company's first Boeing order and will diversify its portfolio following previous Airbus purchases. The stock exchange posting on the eve of the world's largest air show is the most concrete sign so far that the widely expected launch of the Boeing 737 MAX 10 is going ahead, subject to the formal approval of Boeing directors. The launch is expected to trigger a procession of roughly 150 mostly small- to medium-sized orders from airlines, industry sources said. These include low-cost operators Lion Air of Indonesia and India's Spicejet. Ireland's Ryanair (RYA.I) has confirmed it is looking at the jet, but is not expected to strike a deal in time for the show. Expectations were diminishing as the show approached of an order for the jet from United Airlines (UAL.N), which Boeing had been actively wooing as a marquee customer. The 190-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10 is designed to plug a gap at the top end of Boeing's single-aisle range after strong sales of the competing Airbus A321neo. It will be delivered from 2020. Boeing and Airbus are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a recent flood of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years at the show starting on Monday. As often happens when markets soften, leasing companies will be looking for bargains in Paris next week and are expected to feature prominently in any announcements beyond the MAX 10. A handful of airlines were said to be shopping for planes in advance of the show including Peruvian low-cost startup Viva Air, owned by Irelandia Aviation led by the son of Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, which could place an order for Airbus. Saudia budget subsidiary Flyadeal, which has already leased Airbus jets, could soon opt to buy some, industry sources said. Airbus declined comment. Neither airline could be reached.

Guterres on Friday officially put forward Ghassan Salame, a professor of International Relations and Conflict Resolution at Sciences-Po in Paris, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Saturday. Diplomats said objections were unlikely and the U.N. Security Council will greenlight the appointment on Tuesday. The council must agree by consensus on the appointment of special envoys. Traditionally, the U.N. chief informally discusses candidates with the 15-member body to ensure agreement before officially proposing a name. The search for a successor to Martin Kobler, a German diplomat who has served as the U.N. representative in Libya since November 2015, began in February when Guterres proposed former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad for the job. The United States rejected Fayyad because of his nationality. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the United Nations had been  unfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel.   In practice ... if (countries) have a significant objection then they usually make it clear before the secretary-general has made the proposal,  said a senior council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.  So it was very unusual that the United States blocked the Palestinian candidate very late in the day.  Guterres described the U.S. rejection as  a loss for the Libyan peace process and for the Libyan people.

Guterres on Friday officially put forward Ghassan Salame, a professor of International Relations and Conflict Resolution at Sciences-Po in Paris, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Saturday. Diplomats said objections were unlikely and the U.N. Security Council will greenlight the appointment on Tuesday. The council must agree by consensus on the appointment of special envoys. Traditionally, the U.N. chief informally discusses candidates with the 15-member body to ensure agreement before officially proposing a name. The search for a successor to Martin Kobler, a German diplomat who has served as the U.N. representative in Libya since November 2015, began in February when Guterres proposed former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad for the job. The United States rejected Fayyad because of his nationality. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the United Nations had been  unfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel.   In practice ... if (countries) have a significant objection then they usually make it clear before the secretary-general has made the proposal,  said a senior council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.  So it was very unusual that the United States blocked the Palestinian candidate very late in the day.  Guterres described the U.S. rejection as  a loss for the Libyan peace process and for the Libyan people.  Following that objection, Russia and other council members then rejected a British candidate and an American candidate, said diplomats. Kobler's posting was briefly extended until the end of June.

He had roughly $20 million in income from his new marquee Washington hotel, which opened just down the street from the White House last September. Revenues also increased at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida resort known as the  Winter White House.  Trump reported income of at least $594 million for 2016 and early 2017 and assets worth at least $1.4 billion. (bit.ly/2sah0ZM) The 98-page disclosure document posted on the ethics office's  website showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas [DBKGK.UL], a unit of German-based Deutsche Bank AG. For example, Trump disclosed a liability to Deutsche exceeding $50 million for the Old Post Office, a historic Washington property where he has opened a hotel.  Trump reported liabilities of at least $110 million to Ladder Capital Corp , a commercial real estate lender with offices in New York, Los Angeles and Boca Raton, Florida. The largest component of Trump's income was $115.9 million listed as golf-resort related revenues from Trump National Doral in Miami, down from $132 million he reported a year ago. Income from many of his other hotels and resorts largely held steady. Revenue from Trump Corporation, his real-estate management company, nearly tripled, to $18 million, and revenue from Mar-a-Lago grew by 25 percent, to $37.25 million. The private club doubled its initiation fee to $200,000 after Trump's election. He earned $11 million from the Miss Universe pageant, after selling the beauty contest back in 2015.

His assets probably exceeded $1.4 billion because the disclosure form provided ranges of values. The document showed Trump held officer positions in 565 corporations or other entities before becoming U.S. president. His tenure in most of those posts ended on Jan. 19, the day before his inauguration, and in others in 2015 and 2016. Most of the entities involved were based in the United States, with a handful in Scotland, Ireland, Canada, Brazil, Bermuda and elsewhere. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, which would give a much clearer indication of his wealth and business interests. But he has submitted federal forms disclosing his and his family's income, assets and liabilities.  President Trump welcomed the opportunity to voluntarily file his personal financial disclosure form,  the White House said in a statement, adding that the form was  certified by the Office of Government Ethics pursuant to its normal procedures.  An Office of Government Ethics spokesman declined to comment on the contents of the report, other than to say that it was certified by the office, which is an ethics watchdog for federal government employees. Trump released a disclosure form in May 2016 that his campaign at the time said showed his net worth was $10 billion. Some critics disputed that figure as overblown. Before taking office in January, Trump was a New York real estate developer and television celebrity.

China matters for Mickey Mouse's owner: its box office takings there have tripled over the last two years and Shanghai Disneyland has seen more than 10 million guests in its first year, setting it on track for faster profits than Disney reaped from parks in Paris and Hong Kong, both loss-making for most of the years they have been open. The company was  extraordinarily encouraged  by the number of guests who visited Shanghai Disneyland and the satisfaction scores it received, Bob Chapek, head of parks and resorts, told reporters.  I think those are the sort of right precursors, if you will, for future development,  he said when asked about expansion plans.  We're very encouraged by what we've seen.  Disney released 10 films in China last year, including  Zootopia  and  Star Wars: The Force Awakens  with ticket sales of about $1 billion, according to box office tracker EntGroup. That was up from four films and $313 million in 2014. Last month, it rolled out the red carpet in Shanghai for a rare world premiere of the latest film in its  Pirates of the Caribbean  franchise. Stars Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Javier Bardem made an appearance.     It has also been tying up with partners like state-backed producer Shanghai Film Group, its digital subsidiary BesTV for online content, and Shanghai Shendi, its partner for Shanghai. Now, for the first anniversary of the Shanghai park, it will celebrate Disney-style, with lights, fireworks and visits by  executives including Chapek and Chief Executive Bob Iger. Chapek said their hotels at Shanghai Disneyland had hosted almost 750,000 people and had maintained occupancy levels significantly higher than the overall market.  Guests were also spending more time at the park than  anticipated, averaging about nine hours, he said.

CHINA OUT.But along with the hotel rooms and rides, Disney is pursuing a steadier path to build brand and profit in downtown classrooms in six Chinese cities, where children study English with the help of Winnie the Pooh and Captain America.  With the theme park, films, co-productions, Disney English and retail, they're creating an ecosystem to bring consumers in and foster a broader buzz and awareness,  said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.  The aim is to recreate that feeling in the U.S. where you have multiple generations who know the characters and cartoons.  Disney said China was a strategically important market. Slideshow (2 Images) Not only is it home to Shanghai Disney Resort, our largest ever foreign investment, but it has a thriving studio, consumer products and media distribution business,  it said in a statement. Disney is hiring for schools in cities including Beijing, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Shanghai - all decorated with Disney characters and motifs. It has not all been plain sailing. Disney was forced to launch an investigation this year after an employee was found to have set up firms which made deals with local authorities using the Disney name. Local children are also more used to Asian cartoon heroes, while Disney faces caps on imported films, partial bans on foreign cartoons on TV and long-established domestic theme park rivals. However, for 7-year-old Sunny Sun who has been attending classes once a week at Disney English for the past two years, Disney characters are now familiar.  Her mother, freelance writer Happy Chen, plans to take her to the Shanghai park this summer, and says her daughter goes to almost every new Disney animation at the cinema.  Now she really yearns to go to the Disney park,  said Chen, pointing to the crossover between the classes, films, characters and the theme park.   It's all connected.

Temer is the leader of a lower house criminal organization,  Época quoted Batista as saying.  Those who are not under arrest are in the government. They're very dangerous.

The Supreme Court is to discuss the validity of Batista's plea deal, and Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot could file charges against the president for corruption accusations that Batista made in May. Temer, in his statement on Saturday, rebuffed Batista's allegations in the Época interview that, saying that the billionaire repeatedly sought Temer's help for his personal benefit but was denied.  FILE PHOTO: Brazil's President Michel Temer speaks at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil, May 18, 2017.Ueslei Marcelino/File PhotoTemer also attacked terms of the leniency deal that allowed Batista to escape prosecution, saying in the statement that the terms made the billionaire  Brazil's most successful criminal ever.  The statement said Batista's testimonies  puts the blame of his crimes on others, while protecting his real partners.  The statement did not identify anyone. Threat of Ouster Last week, Temer escaped the threat of ouster as president after Brazil's top electoral court dismissed a case over alleged illegal campaign funding for the 2014 election - in which he ran on the same ticket of former President Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff was impeached last year on accusation she oversaw the doctoring of budget accounts. J&F; agreed to pay a record-setting 10.3 billion-real ($3.1 billion) leniency fine, after Joesley Batista and his brother Wesley admitted to bribing almost 1,900 politicians in recent years. J&F-controlled; JBS SA, the world's No. 1 meatpacker, is being investigated for alleged insider trading ahead of the announcement of the Batista family's leniency deal. Batista denied having ordered insider trades at JBS, according to the Época interview, adding that he believed they were all made in line with the law. He said J&F; will sell  as many assets as necessary  to quash concerns about the group's solvency. J&F; diversified from meatpacking in recent years, expanding into fashion, home cleaning, banking and pulpmaking with the help of state loans, prosecutors said.

It was an exciting play that is not seen much in the majors any more.  I'm fine with that,  manager Kevin Cash said.  Looking back on it, ideally, he's thinking along with the game.

I think Sucre, he's done a nice job with the pitchers,  manager Kevin Cash said.  He's earned an opportunity to get more reps back there. I know the pitchers like throwing to him. I like the way he can shut down a running game. He seems really athletic back there. I want to give him a chance to ignite our pitching staff, help them out.  RHP Erasmo Ramirez served up a leadoff home run to 2B Ian Kinsler of Detroit but then retired nine in a row before the roof caved in on him in the fourth and fifth innings.

He's the first Dodgers pitcher to begin a season with 10 or more consecutive starts without a loss since Orel Hershiser went 11 starts to begin the 1985 campaign.  He worked every quadrant tonight,  said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.  His ability to locate and command all three pitches. Very rarely does a pitcher have the command of all three of his pitchers like he's had for this period of time.  Eight innings pitched tied a career high for Wood, who struck out five and did not walk a batter in his 10th start. He also contributed a two-out single in the eighth inning to drive in a run. It was his second hit and third RBI of the season.  I closed my eyes and got a knock,  Wood said. While on the mound, he worked ahead in the count for most of the night and said he only regretted four of his 89 pitches. RHP Josh Ravin was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City on Friday. It's his second stint with the Dodgers this season.  He's really dominating right-hand hitters, according to our reports,  said manager Dave Roberts.  It's just getting that slider to be what it is. He's got a big arm. If he's got the fastball strike and throwing the slider the way he can, (then) he's getting lefties and righties out.  Roberts said situations will dictate how Ravin is used. He went 3-0 with one save while posting a 7.94 ERA at Oklahoma City. He is 2-1 with a 3.79 ERA in 19 career big-league games, with 25 strikeouts in 19 innings. RHP Ross Stripling was optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma City on Friday.  It's to get Ross right,  said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.  He's a part of what we're doing right now and we need him to be good going forward. Just mentally to get away and reset will be beneficial for him.  In his past two appearances, Stripling allowed seven earned runs on 10 hits, including a pair of homers in 3 2/3 innings. LHP Rich Hill allowed seven earned runs through four innings in Thursday's 12-5 loss at Cleveland. He has a 5.14 ERA through eight starts. Last year, Hill posted a 1.83 ERA in six starts after joining the Dodgers and delivered some clutch performances in the postseason.  There are guys you have certain expectations,  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Friday.  With Rich, in particular, you invest in a guy and what we saw last year a guy who can pitch in big games and be elite. We've got to get him back to that. He demands more from himself than anyone. His next turn, we expect him to improve and kind of build on that. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-dodgers-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6HPB9Q2O"},

He also walked and scored in the first, but that could have been a bigger inning for him. He led off the game with a blast to right field that cleared the seating and one-bounced into the Allegheny River. It was initially called a homer, then reversed by the umpires to a foul ball. Cubs manager Joe Maddon was so livid that the initial call did not stand and was not reviewed that he argued until he got ejected. Rizzo thought it was the wrong call.  That was absolutely a home run,  he said.  There is no way it could have gone over the pole foul because this is one of the shortest right fields in the league. I hit it too hard for it to have time to go foul. I respect the umpires and I never like to criticize them because I know they give their very best, but they got that one.

Eickhoff (0-7, 5.09 ERA) managed to avoid a loss his last time out, when he gave up four runs (three earned) and seven hits in six innings in a game at Boston on Monday, though that was the ninth straight start he has given up at least three runs. He has a 6.46 ERA during that span. In two career games against the Diamondbacks (both starts), he's 0-1 with a 4.22 ERA (10 2/3 innings, five ER). CF Odubel Herrera snapped a three-game hitless streak on Friday night, going 2-for-4 with two runs scored in the Phillies' loss to Arizona.

During that time, he is hitting .354 (17-of-48) to raise his average to .264. His hitting streak is also tied for the longest active in the National League and is second longest active in MLB. C Cameron Rupp hit his fifth home run of the season, a solo shot to right, in Friday night's loss to Arizona. That's the first extra-base hit for Rupp since May 19 at Pittsburgh, which was also a home run. He also stole a base on Friday, the second of his career and first since April 22, 2016. RHP Aaron Nola was strong for six innings against Arizona on Friday night, but the seventh inning cost him. Nola (3-5) gave up hits to the first three batters he faced and was burned for three more runs as he took the loss. His final line was six-plus innings, nine hits and five runs (all earned). That's just the second time this season that Nola has given up five earned runs in a start, though he has been tagged for at least one earned run in each of nine outings.

He will report to the Braves' team in the rookie Gulf Coast League. LHP Sean Newcomb (0-2, 2.19 ERA) allowed three runs over six innings against Miami on Friday while losing his second major league start. The Braves haven't scored a run with Newcomb on the mound in either of his starts. Newcomb allowed five hits, walked four and struck out three. He is the first Braves pitcher since the team moved to Atlanta in 1966 to lose his first two appearances despite collecting a quality start in each.

The 27-year-old needs more consistent work, which he can't find currently with the big club.  Ryan is a huge part of this ballclub,  Banister said.  We have an opportunity right now. Let's get 20, 30, 40 at-bats, some consistent work, which he has not gotten. Who's to say what will happen in the next five days, 10 days, but much rather have him with a bank of at-bats and ready to go than sitting on the bench and not getting consistent ABs.  Rua is hitting .202 but with only four at-bats since June 7. LHP Dario Alvarez is making his third stint with the Rangers in 2017 after being recalled from Triple-A Round Rock. Alvarez retired the only batter he saw in leaving Mike Zunino, stranded in the fifth of the Rangers' 10-4 victory on Friday. He is 2-0 with a 3.18 ERA in 15 relief appearances. Alvarez also had stint on the DL with a left elbow strain. RHP Tony Barnette was placed on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to June 15, with a sprained right ring finger. The earliest he can return is June 25. Barnette is 1-1 with a 7.23 ERA in 23 relief appearances. His 76 appearances since the start of 2016 are the third-most among Rangers. RHP Tyson Ross was emotional in his first start in 15 months. The Rangers were ecstatic by what they saw. Ross exceeded just about every expectation, taking a no-hitter into the fifth inning of the Rangers' 10-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Friday. Ross, who hadn't pitched since Opening Day of 2016 for San Diego because of shoulder problems that ultimately led to off-season thoracic surgery, Ross retired the next nine hitters after a leadoff walk and 14 of the next 15.  His official line was 5 2/3 innings pitched, two hits, two runs, three walks and five strikeouts. The victory was his first since Aug. 31, 2015, coincidentally against the Rangers at Petco Park.  I'm pretty stoic in my demeanor, but inside I was real excited to be out there, crossing over those white lines and being handed the ball,  Ross said.  It's been a long time coming, and I'm just happy I was able to do a good job for the team and put us in a position to win. It's a long road, it's tough to go through, and I'm happy to be back in action and I look forward to moving forward.  INF/OF Jurickson Profar was optioned to Triple-A Round Rock before the Rangers' 10-4 victory over Seattle on Friday. Profar was hitting .137. During his second stint with the team, beginning June 9, Profar was 2-for-14 with a walk and six strikeouts. INF/OF Joey Gallo will not get lost in the shuffle of infielders and outfielders with the return of 3B Adrian Beltre three weeks ago and now 1B Mike Napoli on Friday. Gallo, who was out of the lineup on Friday, will see time at third, spelling Beltre, first, the outfield, and designated hitter. Gallo is tied for third in the AL with 18 home runs, but has hit only .201 in 209 at-bats with 89 strikeouts, second in the majors. LHP Cole Hamels (oblique strain) gave up one hit over three innings and 35 pitches in an injury rehabilitation start on Friday with Double-A Frisco. He threw 22 more pitches afterward in the bullpen. 1B Mike Napoli returned to Texas  lineup after a stint on the disabled list with a strained lower back, going 1-for-4 in the Rangers' 10-4 victory over Seattle on Friday. He'll share time with Joey Gallo at first, though, manager Jeff Banister said the rotation won't be a platoon. The more versatile and athletic Gallo can play four positions, including DH, so he'll see time elsewhere. Napoli returned to the active roster with a .192 average with 11 home runs including eight in May -- and 25 RBIs over 51 games. He returned after only one injury rehab game, at Double-A Frisco, going 0-for-4 on Thursday. OF Carlos Gomez, out since May 14 with a strained right hamstring, was activated from the disabled list and back in the lineup on Friday, going 2-for-5 with four RBIs and a three-run homer in the Rangers' 10-4 victory over Seattle. Before his injury, Gomez was batting .246 with four home runs and 13 RBIs in 38 games. Gomez saw time in four injury rehab games with Double-A Frisco and Triple-A Round Rock, going 3-for-14 with a homer and three RBIs.  When he left he was swinging the bat very well,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said.  He was hot.  The Rangers are hoping he still is. RHP Dillon Gee was designated for assignment by the Rangers to make room for RHP Tyson Ross on the 40-man roster. Gee, who has pitched in parts of eight seasons, was 0-0 with a 4.15 ERA in four games, including one start. The Rangers have seven days to trade, release or outright Gee to the minors.  I hope he gets claimed and put on someone's big-league team, that's how much I think of him,  manager Jeff Banister said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rangers-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6HPB9P2B"},

He has been on the DL since April 22 because of a strained groin. Angels manager Mike Scioscia said only that Bedrosian would be used in the  back end  of the bullpen, not committing him to the closer's role right away. RHP Bud Norris has pitched well as the closer in Bedrosian's absence, posting 11 saves with a 2.59 ERA and .200 opposing hitters batting average. RHP Alex Meyer will start Saturday against the Royals. Meyer gave up two runs and five hits in his last start Monday against the Yankees but lasted only 4 2/3 innings because of a high pitch count (93). He did have five strikeouts, including Yankees RF Aaron Judge twice.  I've seen him in the minor leagues,  Judge said.  He's a great guy, electric stuff as well. A fastball with good two-seam action and a wipeout slider. A guy like that you have to focus on location or pick out a pitch and stick to it. He's good, really good.  Meyer has never faced the Royals. RHP Matt Shoemaker is not likely to make his next scheduled start Tuesday in New York against the Yankees. Shoemaker had to leave his last start Wednesday against the Yankees in the fourth inning because of a strained muscle in his right forearm. Because of an off-day Monday, the Angels could skip Shoemaker's place in the rotation and not have to find another starter. RHP Jesse Chavez gave up two runs and nine hits in seven innings on Friday against the Royals while taking the loss. The only two runs he gave up were driven in by OF Lorenzo Cain, who hit a solo homer in the third inning and had a two-out RBI single in the fifth. Chavez has been hit or miss in his 14 starts this season -- he has allowed five runs or more in four starts but two runs or fewer in seven starts, including Friday.  Jesse's success is really contingent on making pitches,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  What we're hopeful of is as he gets into that third time around the order, that 18th, 19th out where he can finish seven like he did, then he's going to have success. He's pitched this deep before in games. Tonight he had good rhythm and good tempo and made pitches. Jesse keeps trying to evolve as a pitcher and I think he did some things tonight that will continue to move him forward.  OF Eric Young Jr. had started all 17 Angels games since the club called him up May 29 to replace injured CF Mike Trout on the roster, but Young was not in the starting lineup Friday against Kansas City. Angels manager Mike Scioscia said he wanted to give Young a breather. Young has performed well playing both left and center field, hitting .316 with three doubles, three homers, 10 RBIs, 14 runs scored, six stolen bases and a .409 on-base percentage. Young got into Friday's game as a pinch hitter and struck out. OF Ben Revere started in left field for the Angels on Friday against the Royals, just his second start in the past nine games. With OF Cameron Maybin healthy and OF Eric Young Jr. playing well, Revere hasn't been used much but got a chance Friday and went 1-for-3 with a single.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6HPB9P2A"},

LHP Sean Manaea allowed five runs on eight hits, including home runs to RF Aaron Judge and 1B Chris Carter, over six innings with seven strikeouts and two walks in a no-decision on Friday night in a 7-6 victory against the Yankees at the Oakland Coliseum. He had gone 5-0 with a 1.97 ERA in his previous five starts, including a 4-1 victory at Yankee Stadium on May 26.  I left a couple pitches up, a few mistake pitches and that's kind of what cost me, led to the home run and the solo shot in the sixth inning,  Manaea said. SS Marcus Semien (right wrist surgery) took pre-game batting practice for the first time Friday night since going on the disabled list April 15. Manager Bob Melvin said there's a chance Semien could begin a rehab assignment late next week. Last season, Semien had 27 doubles, 27 home runs and 75 RBIs, all career highs. 3B Matt Chapman had a two-run single in the eighth inning -- his first major-league hit -- lifting the Oakland Athletics to a 7-6 victory against the New York Yankees on Friday night at the Oakland Coliseum. Chapman singled off Yankees RHP Jonathan Holder with the bases loaded after the Yankees intentionally walked C Stephen Vogt.

He wants to play, he likes to play. He's not afraid of the situations.  Chapman had his first major-league RBI with one out in the second inning on a ground out to third base that initially was ruled an infield single. After a video review, Chapman was ruled out, taking away his hit.  I guess having your first hit taken away from you, just was waiting for something sweeter,  Chapman said.

In his first stint with the club, Curtis appeared in two games, striking out one in 12/3 scoreless innings.

Paxton (5-2) gave up seven runs on seven hits and three walks while striking out four over 3 2/3 innings in taking the loss as Seattle fell 10-4 to Texas on Friday night. Two consecutive two-out walks in a five-run third were backbreakers. Elvis Andrus followed with an RBI double and Beltre drove in two with a base hit.  He just doesn't have any rhythm at all,  manager Scott Servais said.  Even the secondary stuff wasn't very sharp tonight as well. It is what it is. We've got figure it out. Everything looks like a struggle. He's a big part, trying to dig us out of this little hole we've created here. We've got to get him right, back on track.  RHP Mike Clevenger will be recalled from Triple-A Columbus to start the second game of Saturday's doubleheader in Minnesota. Manager Terry Francona said Clevenger will be called up as the 26th man for the doubleheader, which would leave him still available to make his next start in Baltimore because of the 26th man rules for doubleheaders. Clevenger needs to be reassigned to Triple-A after the game but isn't subject to the 10-day waiting period to be recalled. RF Mitch Haniger, like Ben Gamel, another impressive Seattle rookie, was back on base in Seattle's 10-4 loss to Texas on Friday. He was 1-for-3 a day after failing to reach base for the first time in games he has played in, snapping a streak of 25 games. He had hits in 21 of those. He is now hitting .327. LHP Vidal Nuno was called up from Triple-A Norfolk on Friday. He is 1-3 with a 3.00 ERA in 13 games this year for the Tides. He gave up one run in two innings Friday as the Orioles lost 11-2. LF Ben Gamel continues to impress his manager with his outlook at the plate. He was good again on Friday, albeit in a 10-4 loss to Texas, going 1-for-2 with two walks and three runs. Since making his season debut on April 29, Gamel is hitting .347 with 32 runs, 12 doubles, two triples, two home runs and 20 RBIs in 46 games.

In 14 previous games with the Tigers, Hicks is batting .306 with three home runs and 12 RBI. RHP Warwick Saupold has had some success serving as a bridge man for Detroit this season. Saupold was brought in with a man on first, nobody out and a run having scored in the seventh. That made it 13-3, however, and Saupold protected the lead with two innings of shutout relief. He's turned in three strong relief outings and one clunker. 1B Alex Avila replaced DH Miguel Cabrera as the first baseman on Friday night. He'll catch some, play first and be the designated hitter as manager Brad Ausmus rotates players as his designated hitter while DH Victor Martinez is out.  Alex Avila, the way he's swinging the bat, we'd like to keep him in the lineup,  Ausmus said.  This is a good way to keep him in the lineup without having him catch all the time.  Avila was the swing man on a 1-3-2 double play that thwarted a steal of home attempt by CF Mallex Smith in the fourth inning and also hit a leadoff home run, his 10th, that triggered a four-run fourth. RF J.D. Martinez moved up from fifth to fourth in the batting order Friday night and will probably reside in that spot while DH Victor Martinez is on the disabled list.  I'm hoping he's all right,  he said of Victor Martinez.  It's not going to change anything for me. They all know (how to pitch to) me anyway.  LHP Daniel Norris went two batters into the seventh Friday night and left with a big lead that made him the winning pitcher.  He was good,  manager Brad Ausmus said.  With some of the time in the dugout with the high-scoring innings, I think that kind of caught up with him there at the end, but I thought he threw very well. He was better at throwing strikes.  Norris gave up a triple and a single to open the seventh and was replaced by RHP Warwick Saupold. DH Miguel Cabrera served as Detroit's designated hitter Friday night in the absence of DH Victor Martinez, placed on the disabled list with an irregular heartbeat.  It may be depending on the opposing pitcher,  manager Brad Ausmus said of his DH situation.  There may be some kind of rotation. Kevin Rand came and said Miggy's hip was bothering him. So I just figured the obvious choice would be Miggy. As long as he's able to hit. Of course, Miggy being Miggy, said, 'Why don't you DH Alex (Avila)?' I said that's a good idea and I might some time but I figure if we can get you off your feet rather than standing for nine innings, maybe we can knock this thing out.  Cabrera doubled and scored a run in the five-run fifth but also had a key walk to help Detroit score five times in the fourth. He may be back at first base Saturday. DH Victor Martinez was placed on the 10-day disabled list Friday after being diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. Martinez was hospitalized overnight after reporting cold sweats and a racing heartbeat during Detroit's 5-3 win over Tampa Bay.  I talked to Vic,  manager Brad Ausmus said.  It's a little bit scary. It's not something at his age you generally consider an issue or worry about. That being said, he's making it through. There's a little bit of an unknown factor that's causing more anxiety than anything else.

In a statement, Temer's office said he will take  all appropriate actions  against billionaire Joesley Batista, who told Época magazine that the 77-year-old politician has run a bribe-for-favors scheme at the government since 2010.  In his first interview since striking a leniency agreement with Brazilian prosecutors, Batista told Época that Temer asked for money several times in recent years as he led a group of senior politicians regularly demanding kickbacks in exchange for political favors.  Temer is the leader of a lower house criminal organization,  Época quoted Batista as saying.  Those who are not under arrest are in the government. They're very dangerous.  Temer's lawyers said in the statement released by his office that they will file civil and criminal lawsuits against Batista as early as Monday. Press representatives for Batista and his family's investment holding company, J&F; Investimentos SA, were not immediately available for comment. The coming week already promises to be a tense one for Temer and Batista, one of Brazil's richest businessmen. The Supreme Court is to discuss the validity of Batista's plea deal, and Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot could file charges against the president for corruption accusations that Batista made in May. Temer, in his statement on Saturday, rebuffed Batista's allegations in the Época interview that, saying that the billionaire repeatedly sought Temer's help for his personal benefit but was denied.

The statement said Batista's testimonies  puts the blame of his crimes on others, while protecting his real partners.  The statement did not identify anyone. Threat of Ouster Last week, Temer escaped the threat of ouster as president after Brazil's top electoral court dismissed a case over alleged illegal campaign funding for the 2014 election - in which he ran on the same ticket of former President Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff was impeached last year on accusation she oversaw the doctoring of budget accounts. J&F; agreed to pay a record-setting 10.3 billion-real ($3.1 billion) leniency fine, after Joesley Batista and his brother Wesley admitted to bribing almost 1,900 politicians in recent years. J&F-controlled; JBS SA, the world's No. 1 meatpacker, is being investigated for alleged insider trading ahead of the announcement of the Batista family's leniency deal. Batista denied having ordered insider trades at JBS, according to the Época interview, adding that he believed they were all made in line with the law. He said J&F; will sell  as many assets as necessary  to quash concerns about the group's solvency. J&F; diversified from meatpacking in recent years, expanding into fashion, home cleaning, banking and pulpmaking with the help of state loans, prosecutors said.

Much more is at stake than who wins the  Auld Mug , the world's oldest international sporting trophy, as the final of the competition gets underway in Bermuda's Great Sound on Saturday. A win by New Zealand could threaten France's continued sponsorship by French insurance group Groupama [GRPMHA.UL] as the Kiwis have not signed up to a framework agreement that was designed to ensure continuity for the competition.     Yes, I'm hoping for an Oracle win, it's just my point of view for Team France ... Oracle will be good for the future of the America’s Cup itself,  the French skipper said. If New Zealand are victorious, the location and format of the regatta as well as the high-adrenalin 50-foot foiling catamarans that are battling for sailing's ultimate prize could change dramatically.  All five other teams signed up to the framework agreement in January, which aims to encourage more teams to compete by using the same boats to cut the multi-million dollar costs of mounting a campaign, encouraging more teams to participate, and helps to secure television broadcast rights.  If we have to change hulls, its almost twice the price to have our chance to perform,  Cammas said.  The French team is waiting to hear if Groupama will continue their sponsorship, which is expected within the month, after a good performance in the America's Cup despite coming to the competition late and with the smallest budget.  I’m pretty sure Groupama won’t go if the Kiwis win so we have to change out proposal. We will try but I think we will have less chance to achieve that,  Cammas said.  The French are working on other funding alternatives as they wait to hear if they will be able to continue their campaign, which produced a competitive boat and crew in a remarkably short space of time.      Convincing Victories Despite the odds, Cammas and his crew proved that their boat was fast and had winning form, with unexpected but convincing victories over Sweden's Artemis Racing by three seconds and Britain's Land Rover BAR.  Cammas, a former Jules Verne Trophy holder and skipper of Groupama Team France, is one of France's most accomplished sailors. Although it was sometimes difficult for him to be coming from behind, he and his team now have a clearer vision of what it takes to perform in the America's Cup. Uncertainty around the format is, however, making the French team's story a difficult commercial sell.

Despite the difficulties of not knowing, Cammas is determined to keep his campaign and team together at their base in Lorient, Brittany.    My first objective is to do the next campaign with more possibility of performance,  he added.  Cammas, who showed his determination by battling back to the peak levels of fitness required to sail the demanding boats after a serious injury in training in late 2015 nearly severed his foot, sees his future with the America's Cup, which remains his goal.

Palestinian militant factions also denied Islamic State was involved in the attacks in Jerusalem on Friday, in which a second Israeli police officer was wounded. Islamic State's claim of responsibility was reported by the group's Amaq news agency on Friday. Police spokeswoman Luba Simri said the Israeli military had so far found no connection between the three assailants and any armed group.       It was a local cell. At this stage no indication has been found it was directed by terrorist organizations nor has any connection to any organization been found,  Simri said.     The SITE intelligence monitoring group said it was the first time Islamic State had claimed responsibility for an attack inside Israeli-controlled territory. However, a senior official from Hamas, the Islamic group that rules the Gaza Strip, and the People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) said the three attackers, who were all shot dead at the scene, were their own members.

The assaults took place simultaneously in two areas near the Damascus gate of Jerusalem's walled old city.

The Fitzgerald, an Aegis guided missile destroyer, collided with the merchant vessel some 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, the Navy said. Three aboard the destroyer had been medically evacuated to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, including the ship's commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, who was reported to be in stable condition, the Navy said. The other two were being treated for lacerations and bruises, while other injured were being assessed aboard the ship, it said. The USS Fitzgerald sailed into port on Saturday evening but search and rescue efforts by U.S. and Japanese aircraft and surface vessels were continuing for the seven missing sailors, the Navy said. Their names are being withheld until the families have been notified, it added. Benson took command of the Fitzgerald on May 13. He had previously commanded a minesweeper based in Sasebo in western Japan. Unclear What Happened It was unclear how the collision happened.  Once an investigation is complete then any legal issues can be addressed,  a spokesman for the U.S. 7th Fleet said. The U.S. Navy said the collision happened at about 2:30 a.m. local time (1730 GMT), while the Japanese Coast Guard said it took place at 1:30 a.m. local time. The Fitzgerald suffered damage on her starboard side above and below the waterline, causing  significant damage  and flooding to two berthing spaces and other areas of the ship, the Navy said. The flooding was later stabilized, but it was uncertain how long it would take to gain access to those spaces once the ship docked, to continue the search for the missing, it said. Back in Yokosuka, divers will inspect the damage and develop a plan for repairs, the Navy said.

The Japanese Coast Guard said separately the Fitzgerald was towed back to Yokosuka by a tugboat at about 3 knots.

Japan's Nippon Yusen KK, which charters the container ship, ASX Crystal, said in a statement it would  cooperate fully  with the Coast Guard's investigation of the incident.

Busy Waterways     The waterways approaching Tokyo Bay are busy with commercial vessels sailing to and from Japan’s two biggest container ports in Tokyo and Yokohama.  International maritime rules for collision avoidance do not define right of way for any one vessel, but provide common standards for signaling between ships, as well as regulations on posting lookouts. Japan's public broadcaster NHK showed aerial footage of the Fitzgerald, which had a large dent on its right, or starboard, side. Images broadcast by NHK showed it had been struck next to its Aegis radar arrays behind the vertical launch tubes. Such incidents are rare. In May, the U.S. Navy's USS Lake Champlain collided with a South Korean fishing vessel but both ships were able to operate under their own power. The 7th Fleet commander, Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, thanked the Japanese Coast guard in a post on the fleet's Facebook page, adding:  We are committed to ensuring the safe return of the ship to port in Yokosuka.

Goldman advised Amazon.com Inc and Evercore advised Whole Foods Markets Inc on Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods that will see the U.S. organic grocery chain become part of the world's largest internet retailer. The deal was Amazon's first valued at more than $1 billion, making it a coveted trophy for investment bankers in search of fees and glory. Goldman had laid the ground for this moment. Last year, it dispatched senior bankers to several North American cities where big companies are based, including Atlanta, Toronto and Seattle.    One of those bankers, David Eisman, moved from San Francisco to Seattle to help lead a small team tasked with strengthening ties with the city's biggest companies, including Amazon, Microsoft Corp and Starbucks Corp.   When Amazon decided to approach Whole Foods last month, it picked Goldman for advice. Eisman advised the company alongside fellow Goldman bankers Colin Ryan, who focuses on technology mergers, and Cosmo Roe, who focuses on consumer and retail companies.  FILE PHOTO - Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in Manhattan, New York, U.S. on January 29, 2016.Mike Segar/File PhotoEvercore itself clinched a role in the deal with the help of a Goldman alumnus. Last year, Evercore poached Goldman's head of activism defense Bill Anderson, who for more than 12 years had advised more than 175 companies on how to tackle activist investors and hostile bids. When Jana Partners LLC in April said it had raised its stake in Whole Foods in April and pushed for a sale of the company, Whole Foods interviewed several investment banks to hire an adviser to help defend against the activist hedge fund.  From the moment Jana had announced its stake in Whole Foods ... an onslaught of attention from media and banks ensued,  Whole Foods' chief executive, John Mackey, said in a Texas Monthly article this month. Whole Foods' conversations with banks took place before the company was approached by Amazon, so Goldman was also vying for a role with Whole Foods. With Anderson among its ranks, however, Evercore prevailed. When Amazon approached, Whole Foods turned again to Evercore. Anderson advised Whole Foods alongside senior Evercore bankers Eduardo Mestre and William Hiltz. Goldman now stands to receive $30 million to $35 million in advisory fees, while Evercore stands to receive $40 million to $50 million, according to estimates from investment banking advisory firm Freeman & Co LLC. Goldman and Bank of America Corp, which provided bridge financing to Amazon, could receive between $35 million and $50 million in debt arranging fees, according to Freeman.

Amazon used aggressive pricing to become an e-commerce retail juggernaut and has recently been experimenting with brick-and-mortar outlets. It will take over a natural and organic grocer pioneer with 456 stores, a mecca for young, high-end shoppers, that has been struggling to rein in prices and integrate technology. The deal represents a dramatic turn in strategy for Amazon, which has offered food delivery through its Fresh service for a decade but has not made a major dent in the $700 billion grocery market. “The ramifications for all of retail are seismic – not just retailers that sell grocery, but for everyone,” Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said. For graphic - Whole Foods at a glance - click: tmsnrt.rs/2skJDSv Shares of dozens of supermarkets, food producers, payment processors and shopping malls collectively lost at least $35 billion in U.S. market value on Friday as the news reverberated across financial markets. Shares of grocer Kroger Co swooned 9.2 percent, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc fell 4.7 percent, signaling fears that Amazon could broaden Whole Foods' product mix and cut prices. Amazon's shares rose 2.4 percent to $987.71, adding $11 billion to its market capitalization, which in one sense makes the acquisition nearly free for Amazon shareholders.   Supermarkets will now have to contend with not only competition with each other and non-traditional grocers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp, but with a retailer like Amazon which has the financial capacity to price aggressively,  said Mickey Chadha, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service. Amazon agreed to pay $42 per share in cash for Whole Foods, a 27 percent premium on the Austin, Texas-based grocer's closing share price on Thursday.

No Value in Status Quo A former grocery expert at Amazon predicted that the chain, nicknamed  Whole Paycheck , would add a selection of discounted food and build out non-grocery areas within stores, particularly for pharmacy and Amazon devices.  There’s no value in Amazon keeping the status quo at Whole Foods. Whole Foods was losing market share to Kroger,  said Brittain Ladd, who until earlier this year was a senior manager working to roll out AmazonFresh globally.   It’s pharmacy. It’s having the ability to put stores that are similar to Apple stores inside Whole Foods,  he said.  Amazon has been looking at shop layouts that could allow traditional in-store purchase, online ordering with on-site pickup, and home delivery, using store warehouse space as a distribution point, Ladd said. A Whole Foods Market is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S. June 16, 2017.Carlo AllegriDespite Amazon's reputation for harnessing technology, a prototype store inside its corporate office in Seattle, called Amazon Go, which uses sensors and tech-savvy cameras to detect shoppers' selections and then charge their Amazon accounts, has rolled out more slowly than planned, a person familiar with the matter said.  And while some analysts expect Amazon to bring vast buying power to Whole Foods, Amazon's heft in the food market is far smaller than in other areas, and high demand for organic products gives farmers unusual bargaining power. Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said plans do not include reducing jobs as the result of the deal and that the company does not plan to automate Whole Foods cashiers jobs with Amazon Go technology.  Whole Foods Was Under Pressure The deal unfolded after Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive officer, approached Whole Foods CEO John Mackey about a month ago and received an eager response from Mackey, two people familiar with the matter said. Slideshow (18 Images)The grocer will continue to operate stores under the Whole Foods Market brand, and Mackey will remain CEO, the companies said.  Whole Foods has posted seven straight quarterly sales declines at established stores and recently overhauled its board of directors in the face of pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC. Jana, which disclosed an 8.3 percent stake in Whole Foods in April and is the company's second biggest shareholder, stands to make roughly $300 million from the sale to Amazon. The deal is for $13.4 billion in cash and the remainder in debt. The acquisition price implies a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Whole Foods of 31 times, versus a 14.4 average for the S&P; 500 Food Retail index. Amazon and Whole Foods expect to close the deal during the second half of 2017. Eyes on Grocery Shoppers Amazon, started in Seattle in 1994 by Bezos, a former hedge fund manager, has grown into the world's biggest diversified online retailer, with a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion. It has expanded from a book seller into a merchant of nearly all consumer products, as well as producing videos.  Both Amazon and Whole Foods cater to younger consumers including millennials as well as the affluent.  Amazon could bring technology to all Whole Foods locations, or it could absorb Whole Foods into AmazonFresh. Either way, it's good for consumers like myself,  said Di Wu, a New York resident in her early 30s who is a member of Amazon's Prime fast-shipping club and who shops at Whole Foods at least twice a week.

Fisher died aged 60 on Dec. 27, four days after she became unresponsive on a flight from London to Los Angeles and was rushed to a hospital.  Fisher was a mental health advocate who spoke about her struggles with bipolar disorder and cocaine addiction. Aside from her film work, she was also popular as a writer and humorist and her memoir  The Princess Diarist  was released a few weeks before she died.    The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office conducted an examination of her body on Dec. 30 and has since found she died of sleep apnea and  other undetermined factors,  the coroner's statement said. Fisher also had atherosclerotic heart disease and had used drugs, the statement said, but noted the significance of these factors in relation to her demise had not been ascertained.  A watch commander for the coroner's office declined to provide additional details on the findings, referring questions to a representative who was not immediately available.

The day after Carrie Fisher died, Reynolds, who starred in Hollywood musicals such as  Singin' in the Rain,  suffered a stroke and died, aged 84. Eddie Fisher died in 2010.  Born in Beverly Hills, Carrie Fisher got her show business start at age 12 in her mother's Las Vegas nightclub act. She made her film debut as a teenager in 1975 comedy  Shampoo,  two years before her breakthrough in the first  Star Wars  movie. Fisher reprised the role in later  Star Wars  sequels, gaining sex symbol status in  Return of the Jedi  in 1983 when her Leia character wore a metallic gold bikini while enslaved by the diabolical Jabba the Hutt. In the 2015 film  Star Wars: The Force Awakens,  also known as  Episode VII  of the franchise, she appeared again as Leia, who by then had become an astute military general. After undergoing treatment in the mid-1980s for cocaine addiction, Fisher wrote the bestselling novel  Postcards from the Edge,  about a drug-abusing actress forced to move in with her mother. The book was later adapted into a film starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine.

Most of the players are traveling with physios now, spending a lot more time working in the gym to protect their bodies from the kind of pounding you give it on the court as well.

The Fitzgerald, an Aegis guided missile destroyer, collided with the merchant vessel some 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, the Navy said. Three aboard the destroyer had been medically evacuated to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, including the ship's commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, who was reported to be in stable condition, the Navy said. The other two were being treated for lacerations and bruises, while other injured were being assessed aboard the ship, it said. The USS Fitzgerald sailed into port on Saturday evening but search and rescue efforts by U.S. and Japanese aircraft and surface vessels were continuing for the seven missing sailors, the Navy said. Their names are being withheld until the families have been notified, it added. Benson took command of the Fitzgerald on May 13. He had previously commanded a minesweeper based in Sasebo in western Japan. Unclear What Happened It was unclear how the collision happened.  Once an investigation is complete then any legal issues can be addressed,  a spokesman for the U.S. 7th Fleet said. The U.S. Navy said the collision happened at about 2:30 a.m. local time (1730 GMT), while the Japanese Coast Guard said it took place at 1:30 a.m. local time. The Fitzgerald suffered damage on her starboard side above and below the waterline, causing  significant damage  and flooding to two berthing spaces and other areas of the ship, the Navy said. The flooding was later stabilized, but it was uncertain how long it would take to gain access to those spaces once the ship docked, to continue the search for the missing, it said. Back in Yokosuka, divers will inspect the damage and develop a plan for repairs, the Navy said.

The Japanese Coast Guard said separately the Fitzgerald was towed back to Yokosuka by a tugboat at about 3 knots.  Part of an eight-ship squadron based in Yokosuka, the Fitzgerald had in February completed $21 million worth of upgrades and repairs. Japan's Nippon Yusen KK, which charters the container ship, ASX Crystal, said in a statement it would  cooperate fully  with the Coast Guard's investigation of the incident. At around 29,000 tons displacement, the ship dwarfs the 8,315-ton U.S. warship, and was carrying 1,080 containers from the port of Nagoya to Tokyo. Slideshow (17 Images)None of the 20 crew members aboard the container ship, all Filipino, were injured, and the ship was not leaking oil, Nippon Yusen said.

International maritime rules for collision avoidance do not define right of way for any one vessel, but provide common standards for signaling between ships, as well as regulations on posting lookouts. Japan's public broadcaster NHK showed aerial footage of the Fitzgerald, which had a large dent on its right, or starboard, side. Images broadcast by NHK showed it had been struck next to its Aegis radar arrays behind the vertical launch tubes. Such incidents are rare. In May, the U.S. Navy's USS Lake Champlain collided with a South Korean fishing vessel but both ships were able to operate under their own power. The 7th Fleet commander, Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, thanked the Japanese Coast guard in a post on the fleet's Facebook page, adding:  We are committed to ensuring the safe return of the ship to port in Yokosuka.

The capture of al-Waleed removes Islamic State fighters from the vicinity of a U.S. base located on the other side of the border, in Syrian territory. Aircraft from the U.S.-led coalition and the Iraqi air force took part in the operation, the statement said. Al-Waleed is close to Tanf, a strategic Syrian border crossing with Iraq on the Baghdad-Damascus highway, where U.S. forces have assisted Syrian rebels trying to recapture territory from Islamic State. U.S. forces have been based at Tanf since last year, in effect preventing Iranian-backed forces supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from receiving heavy weaponry from Iran by using the main highway between Iraq and Syria. The involvement of Iraqi Sunni tribal fighters in the operation to dislodge the militants from al-Waleed is another indication that Iran will not yet be able to use the highway. Pro-Assad forces in Syria, mainly comprising Iraqi Shi'ite militias, last week reached the Iraqi border north-east of Tanf, potentially preventing the U.S.-backed rebels from taking more territory from Islamic State alongside the border area with Iraq.   In Mosul, where a U.S.-backed offensive against Islamic State on Saturday entered its ninth month, the militants have been squeezed into an enclave on the western bank of the Tigris river. Islamic State also controls territory along the border with Syria and urban pockets west and south of Mosul. In Syria, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, made up predominantly of Kurdish fighters, have seized territory to the north, east and west of Raqqa, Islamic State's Syrian bastion.  About 100,000 civilians remain trapped in harrowing conditions behind Islamic State lines in Mosul, with little food, water and medicine and limited access to hospitals, the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said on Friday. Islamic State snipers are shooting at families trying to flee on foot or by boat across the Tigris River, as part of a tactic to keep civilians as human shields, it said. Iraqi government forces regained eastern Mosul in January, then a month later began the offensive on the western side that includes the Old City, a dense maze of narrow alleyways where fighting is mainly done house by house. The fall of Mosul would, in effect, mark the end of the Iraqi half of the  caliphate  that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared in a speech from an historic mosque in the Old City three years ago, covering parts of Iraq and Syria. Moscow said on Friday its forces may have killed Baghdadi in an air strike in Syria last month, but Washington said it could not corroborate the death and Western and Iraqi officials were skeptical. About 200,000 people were estimated to be trapped behind Islamic State lines in Mosul in May, but the number has declined as government forces have thrust further into the city. About 800,000 people, more than a third of the pre-war population of the northern Iraqi city, have fled, seeking refuge with friends and relatives or in camps.

Boeing earlier this year briefly suspended 737 MAX test flights while CFM, co-owned by Safran and General Electric, conducted checks after a quality problem was found in a turbine disc. Safran and GE have both recently talked of 450-500 engine deliveries but CFM officials told a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow that they remained committed to the target of 500 and that their level of confidence had not changed. They said the engine, developed for Boeing and Airbus medium-haul planes, was proving to have higher utilisation rates than a rival model from Pratt & Whitney. Each 1 percent in improved utilisation has the same benefit for airline finances as a 5 percent fuel saving, they said. CFM expects to have clearance for 180-minute extended operations by the end of June for the Boeing and Airbus versions of LEAP. That means planes will be able to fly up to 3 hours away from the nearest airport at any one time, allowing airlines to serve long over-water routes like Hawaii to the U.S. West Coast.

Once a rising star in the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party, Anwar is seen as the greatest threat to Prime Minister Najib Razak and his coalition, after leading a three-party opposition alliance to stunning electoral gains in 2013. Anwar was convicted and jailed for sodomizing a former aide, a charge he and his supporters describe as a politically motivated attempt to end his career.  Government sources have told Reuters that a general election could be held later this year in a bid to prevent the opposition from gaining ground. An election has to be called by mid-2018. Anwar endorsed a political compact spearheaded by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, as ruling party rebels and the opposition joined hands to fight against Najib, who is embroiled in a corruption scandal.  In order to call for a focus on the general elections, I am choosing not to offer myself as the candidate for prime minister,  Anwar said in a statement.   In hopes of amassing all strengths in a team to go against UMNO-BN, it is fair to ensure the participation of all leaders effectively. This includes benefiting from the position and role of Mahathir,  he said, referring to the ruling coalition.  Mahathir, 91, Malaysia's longest serving prime minister, said earlier in June that he would consider taking up the premier position again, but only if there was no acceptable candidate after an opposition election victory. Najib has been embroiled in a corruption scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad. He has denied any wrongdoing, even as the fund became the subject of money laundering investigations in the United States and at least five other countries.

On Thursday the U.N. Security Council urged the warring parties to agree on a U.N.-brokered plan to keep the Houthi-held port of Hodeidah out of the fighting and to resume government salary payments.     The U.N. has proposed that Hodeidah, a vital aid delivery point on the Red Sea where some 80 percent of Yemen's food imports arrive, should be turned over to a neutral party. The U.N. Security Council warned the Saudi-led Arab coalition, that is fighting the Houthis, against any attempt to extend the war to the port.  Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdel-Malek al-Mekhlafi said in a tweet his government renewed its acceptance of the proposals first made by U.N. Yemen envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed in May. But a spokesperson for the Houthis said the Security Council through its statements was encouraging the Saudi-led alliance to resume its strikes and that they reserved the right to respond to any aggression.

Yemen has been torn apart by more than two years of civil war that pits the Houthi group against the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by the Saudi-led alliance.

PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) - A Minnesota police officer was acquitted on Friday in the slaying of a black motorist he shot five times during a traffic stop last year, an incident that drew national attention after the victim's girlfriend live-streamed the bloody aftermath on social media. St. Anthony Police Department officer Jeronimo Yanez, who testified that he feared for his life when he fatally shot Philando Castile last July, was found not guilty of second-degree manslaughter. The jury of seven men and five women, 10 of whom were white and two of whom were black, sided with the officer after deliberating for more than 25 hours spanning five days, acquitting Yanez on all charges. The shooting death of Castile, 32, in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights triggered local protests and fueled debate across the country over the appropriate use of force by law enforcement against minorities. Friday's verdict drew an angry reaction from Castile's mother.  I'm mad as hell right now,  Valerie Castile told reporters after the verdict.  My first-born son died. ... Just because he was a police officer, that makes it OK.  She said the verdict shows  the system continues to fail black people.  Yanez, the son of a Mexican immigrant, testified during the trial in Ramsey County District Court that he feared for his life after Castile began reaching for a firearm that Castile had disclosed he had in his possession.  Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the state capitol in St. Paul on Friday evening, and a series of speakers demanded justice for minorities in the American judicial system and stronger accountability measures for police. Many people waved signs and chanted in unison  stand up, fight back  and  if we don't get no justice, they don't get no peace.  After the rally, police said roughly 2,000 people marched peacefully down streets in St. Paul, at times blocking traffic at intersections and then on Interstate 94, a major highway. Marchers also blocked commuter trains at one point and chanted  Yanez Guilty.  An attorney for Yanez, Earl Gray, praised the verdict. Two woman hold protest signs in support of Philando Castile during a rally on the capitol steps after a jury found St. Anthony Police Department officer Jeronimo Yanez not guilty of second-degree manslaughter in the death of Castile, in St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S. June 16, 2017.Eric Miller Justice was done,  Gray told Reuters by telephone.  We're very happy. Yanez was innocent. He was just doing his job.  Shortly after the verdict, the City of St. Anthony said Yanez would not return to active duty and that it was negotiating a  voluntary separation agreement  with him. Castile  Was Compliant  The video footage of the aftermath of the shooting taken by Castile's girlfriend, which went viral, had shaped many public perceptions of the fatal shooting before the trial.  Slideshow (19 Images)The video begins with the girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, in the passenger seat as Castile, covered in blood, sits in the driver's seat and a patrolman points his gun into the vehicle.   He was trying to get out his ID and his wallet out of his pocket,  Reynolds says.  He let the officer know that he had a firearm and that he was reaching for his wallet, and the officer just shot him in his arm.  Castile was shot with Reynolds and her 4-year-old daughter in the car. The video showed blood oozing through Castile's shirt as he appeared to lose consciousness.  Fuck!  a voice is heard screaming.  I told him not to reach for it.  Prosecutors said Yanez was not justified in firing his gun, saying that Castile was courteous and non-threatening.  John Choi, the Ramsey County prosecutor assigned to the case, told reporters following the verdict that Castile  did nothing that justified the taking of his life.   He was compliant,  Choi said. After the shooting, then-President Barack Obama described as tragedies the deaths of Castile and of 37-year-old Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana - the second black man slain during an altercation with police in two days.  All of us as Americans should be troubled by these shootings, because these are not isolated incidents,  Obama said at the time.

Three opinion polls ahead of Sunday's second round of legislative elections indicated that the upstart centrist president and his one-year-old Republic on the Move (LREM) party would win 80 percent or more of the seats in the lower house. Those were the highest predictions of the campaign to date. Macron's opponents, still smarting from his presidential victory just over a month ago, warn that such a majority in a country with obvious and deep political divisions is a threat to democracy. LREM's dominance of parliament would be the biggest in decades by any party, even though it gathered only about a third of votes in round one. Over half of the electorate did not vote, and many said they saw no point in doing so. The latest polls indicated that even fewer would turn out in round two. France's two-round voting system, used in all types of elections including the presidential contest that brought Macron to power, eliminates low-scoring candidates after the first round. Thanks to this system, and to electoral pacts aimed at keeping far-right National Front candidates out of parliament, the National Front looks set to get only a handful of seats in the National Assembly, even though its leader Marine Le Pen won the support of a third of voters in the presidential election. Some surveys indicate that she may even be the only National Front member in the 577-seat Assembly. Left and far-left lawmakers are also expected to be few in number.  We will ask parliament to work on this subject,  technology minister Mounir Mahjoubi said on France 2 television. French President Emmanuel Macron and wife Brigitte vote in the first of two rounds of parliamentary elections in Le Touquet, France, June 11, 2017.Christophe Petit Tesson/Pool By introducing a dose of proportional representation, parties that get such (low) scores would have more representation. That would be fairer, and above all it would improve debate.  Challenges Ahead? Polls by Opinionway and Harris Interactive on Thursday had LREM and its center-right Modem ally winning between 440 and 470 seats in the lower house, a majority unseen since conservative president Charles De Gaulle took over 80 percent of seats in 1968. A poll by Odoxa published on Friday, the last day of campaigning, put them on 430 to 460 seats. Macron has promised to push through pro-business labor reforms that go beyond those he was involved in as economy minister in the Socialist government of 2012 to 2017. While the proposals have been part of his appeal to the broader electorate, and are welcomed in French business circles, they are deeply unpopular with some sections of society who fear erosion of workers' rights. Controversy over the subject resulted in strikes and street protests last year, tore the then-ruling Socialist party apart, and helped cause its disastrous election showings this year. Jean-Luc Melenchon, a far-left candidate backed by a fifth of the electorate in the presidential vote, is set to be one of the few left-wing lawmakers to sit in the new parliament. On Friday, he said Macron should not expect an easy ride.  If you believe the workers of this country and salaried employees generally are going to be fleeced simply because all the glossy magazines have published a smiling photo of the young prince (Macron), you are dreaming,  he said on Europe 1 radio.  This is France, and a century and a half of struggle for the rights enshrined in the labor code are not going to be wiped out at the stroke of a pen. There will be a struggle.

On Friday, Djibouti's Foreign Minister Mahamoud Ali Youssouf said Eritrean troops had seized Dumeira Mountain and Dumeira Island, areas the neighbors contest, and his country's military was on alert. Authorities in the Eritrean capital Asmara were not available for comment. Qatari peacekeepers were previously deployed along the frontier. Doha announced on June 14 that it had pulled its contingent out, days after the East African countries sided with Saudi Arabia and its allies in their standoff with Qatar. In a statement, the African Union Commission's Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat appealed for calm.   The AU Commission, in close consultations with the authorities in Djibouti and Eritrea, is in the process of deploying a fact-finding mission to the Djibouti-Eritrea border,  he said.  The United Nations Security Council is due to discuss the situation behind closed doors on Monday, according to diplomats. Clashes broke out between the Horn of Africa countries in June 2008 after Djibouti accused Asmara of moving troops across the border, raising fears the spat could engulf the region. The dispute triggered several days of fighting in which a dozen Djiboutian troops died and dozens were wounded. Eritrea had initially denied making any incursions, accusing Djibouti of launching unprovoked attacks. At the time, the U.N. Security Council requested both sides withdraw, before the neighbors accepted a Qatari request to mediate and deploy peacekeepers. Qatar has not given reasons for its withdrawal, but it comes amid a diplomatic crisis with some of its Arab neighbors. They cut ties a week ago, accusing Qatar of backing Islamist militants and Iran - claims Doha strongly denies.

The court set a verdict session for July 22, after referring its recommendation to the country's top religious authority, the Grand Mufti, for a non-binding legally-required opinion. The July 22 verdict can be appealed against. Public prosecutor Hisham Barakat was killed in a car bomb attack on his convoy in Cairo, an operation for which Egypt blamed the Muslim Brotherhood and Gaza-based Hamas militants, though both groups have denied it.  The brutal conspiracy by hired hands to target the public prosecutor Hisham Barakat and assassinate him, where the corrupt and weak-willed forces of evil and tyranny conspired, could only be carried out by an unjust group that has shed innocent blood,  said Judge Hassan Farid. Farid initially read out 31 names but two of them referred to the same person and the judge then corrected himself.

Slideshow (7 Images)The defendants said they were forced to confess under torture and their lawyers asked that they be medically examined. Farid said he granted the request to a majority, but not all, and that doctors in a prison hospital had found no signs of torture. Egypt faces an Islamist insurgency led by Islamic State in North Sinai, where hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed.  The group has also increasingly carried out attacks in Egypt targeting Christians in a spate of church bombings and shootings that have killed some 100 since December. Barakat was the highest-ranking state official to die in a militant attack since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a former military chief, ousted President Mohamed Mursi, a Brotherhood leader, in 2013 after mass protests against his rule.

Russia and the West have traded economic blows since 2014, when Moscow annexed Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and lent support to separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.  The West imposed economic and financial sanctions that battered the rouble and the export-dependent economy. Moscow retaliated by banning imports of Western food, which also hit ordinary Russians by spurring inflation, and barred some individuals from entering Russia. The threat of a new wave of sanctions emerged this month as  U.S. policymakers backed the idea of punishing Russia for  alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and for supporting Syria's government in the six-year-long civil war. Putin had previously dismissed the proposed sanctions, saying they reflected an internal political struggle in the United States, and that Washington had always used such methods as a means of trying to contain Russia.

The party unveiled its election programme days after Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said he would step down as leader of the country's oldest party in an attempt to reverse its slide in opinion polls. In its programme, the party promised to cut taxes for employees, extend holidays to five weeks, raise the minimum wage to at least 16,000 crowns ($685) a month by 2022 and other incentives. It also repeated a pledge from previous elections to introduce progressive taxation on big banks' assets and to clamp down on tax evasion by big business conglomerates. In an attempt to shake things up, Sobotka proposed this week that his more popular and eloquent foreign minister, Lubomir Zaoralek, should lead the party's campaign into the Oct. 20-21 general election. Zaoralek said on Saturday that the country needed consensus at home to make progress.  The Left will not be convincing if it will not honour national interests,  he said, adding that the party could also borrow the slogan  to help and to protect  from police cars. Although the government has presided over a growing economy that helped it deliver the first balanced budget in two decades, the Social Democrats have slipped in the polls behind their main rival and coalition partner ANO. All recent polls have shown ANO leading the Social Democrats, in some cases by a double-digit margin. ANO was founded and is chaired by billionaire and former Finance Minister Andrej Babis, who has attracted voters with his managerial approach to governing and with his image as a political outsider. The parties, together with the Christian Democrats, came to power in a centre-left coalition in January 2014 and are on course to becoming the first government in 15 years in the central European country to finish its term.

Instead, the visiting Nationals have widened the gap with two comfortable wins over the Mets, and they’ll try to make it three straight Saturday. Washington entered the series having lost five of six, while New York had won five of six and pulled within 8 1/2 games of the division-leading Nationals. The prospect of the Mets making a charge seemed plausible, but the Nationals have won the first two contests 8-3 and 7-2 as injuries continue to mount for the Mets. The Nationals belted three home runs in Friday’s victory and have 12 blasts in their last five games. Nationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg will be eager to take the mound at Citi Field, where he is 6-1 with a 1.97 ERA in eight starts and has not lost since 2013.

The 28-year-old struck out 10 Braves, but he also surrendered three home runs. Strasburg is 7-4 with a 2.64 ERA in 13 starts against the Mets. Lugo hit the disabled list in the opening week of the season with a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament, but he looked fully recovered in his season debut Sunday at Atlanta. The 27-year-old struck out six and limited the Braves to one run and six hits over seven innings in a 2-1 win. Lugo made one start and one relief appearance against the Nationals last season, allowing one run and six hits over nine innings and earning a win in the start. Walk-Offs 1. Nationals RF Bryce Harper was 3-for-5 with an RBI on Friday and is 13-for-38 during a nine-game hitting streak. 2. The Mets on Friday placed RH Matt Harvey and CF Juan Lagares on the 10-day disabled list and recalled INF Matt Reynolds and OF Brandon Nimmo. 3.

The Yankees rallied from numerous deficits in the first two contests of the four-game series but ultimately fell to 1-4 on their seven-game California trip. New York trailed 4-0 early in Friday's contest but scored six unanswered runs, with rookie Aaron Judge belting his major league-leading 23rd homer - a three-run shot in the third inning - before suffering its third one-run defeat during its slide. Judge's blast ended a three-game drought, giving him five homers and 11 RBIs over his last seven contests. Rookie Matt Chapman was Oakland's hero on Friday, driving in the tying and winning runs with his first major-league hit - a single down the left-field line in the eighth inning.

Hahn has won only one of his last eight outings and is coming off a no-decision at Tampa Bay on Sunday in which he gave up three runs and seven hits over five innings.

After halting their recent struggles against the Mariners to get back to .500 in the opener, the Rangers eye their seventh win in eight contests overall Saturday when they continue a three-game set against their American League West rival in Texas. Since May 9, the Rangers (33-33) have posted a 10-game winning streak, immediately followed by a 4-12 stretch before they went 5-1 during a six-game road trip against division leaders Washington and Houston leading into this series. Texas mustered a total of 16 runs while losing five of its first six meetings to Seattle, but Carlos Gomez put an emphatic end to those struggles with a season-high four RBIs in Friday's 10-4 series-opening rout - his first game back since missing over a month recovering from a hamstring injury. Seattle won nine of 10 to get back to the break-even mark on June 7 after falling a season-low eight games under .500, but it is only 3-6 since. Mariners rookie Ben Gamel went 1-for-2 and scored three times Friday to continue his blistering offensive pace during his eight-game hitting streak - a stretch during which he is batting .500 with six multi-hit games and 10 runs scored.

The outing halted a two-game stretch in which the 31-year-old had surrendered 10 runs, 12 hits (three homers) and five walks over 10 innings and lowered his marks in three June starts to 1-1 with a 7.31 ERA. Gallardo settled for a no-decision versus the Rangers on May 5 despite permitting one run and four hits in six frames. Perez watched his winless streak extended to four outings following last Saturday's no-decision in Washington, yielding two runs on seven hits while fanning five across five innings. The 26-year-old Venezuelan was tagged for 11 runs (10 earned) and 16 hits (four home runs) over only 8 2/3 frames in his last turns at home.

McDonald's deal would have run through the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, and bowing out will likely to save it hundreds of million of dollars if it had continued into the next four-year Olympics cycle and beyond.  McDonald's has been trying to hold down costs as it invests in improving food quality, restaurant service and online ordering to woo back U.S. diners. Intense competition has gnawed away at sales.  We are reconsidering all aspects of our business and have made this decision in cooperation with the IOC to focus on different priorities,  said McDonald's Global Chief Marketing Officer Silvia Lagnado. The company, first involved with the games in 1968 and a sponsor since 1976, was the Olympics' food retail sponsor. Despite pulling out with immediate effect, McDonald's will continue at next year's Pyeongchang winter Olympics as a domestic sponsor. The company's move may also reflect a rising view among consumer brands that exclusive Olympics sponsorship deals do not offer the marketing impact they once did. Some companies find it is much cheaper to work directly with athletes or specific countries than the IOC.  Moreover, in a trend that began after the Beijing games in 2008, shrinking television audiences for the games could be diminishing the value of sponsors' ads. With the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016, many viewers turned to social media alternatives like Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook Inc (FB.O).  In the United States, Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) NBCUniversal said it had attracted 8.6 percent fewer eyeballs for Rio than it did for London in 2012. FILE PHOTO - Athletes line up at a McDonald's inside the Olympic village in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on August 1, 2016.Kai Pfaffenbach/File PhotoThe fast food chain has been part of the IOC's top sponsors program that contributes more than $1 billion in each four-year cycle for the games. While terms of Olympic sponsorship are not disclosed, a source who negotiated previous IOC sponsorship deals said that top global sponsors like McDonald's spend about $25 million a  year or about $100 million for a four-year period that includes a summer and winter games.     Reuters previously reported that the IOC had wanted to roughly double fees to $200 million per four year period starting in 2021. While it is unusual for an Olympic sponsor to leave early, sponsors change regularly within the IOC's top program. The most recent addition was China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), which signed a deal in January for a partnership through 2028.  The next three Olympics take place in Asia, and this could turn off U.S. sponsors trying to reach a U.S. audience. The U.S. Olympic Committee also has lost recent sponsors such as AT&T; (T.N) and Citigroup (C.N) ahead of the 2018 winter games in South Korea.  The IOC said it was not planning a direct replacement for McDonald's, but it is expected to announce a new global deal with Intel Corp (INTC.O) next week, according a source familiar with the matter. Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Companies with a deep focus on technology are barging in while others migrate out,  said Peter Land, who works with Olympics and Paralympics sponsors for communications firm Finsbury.  The IOC has faced criticism from public health campaigners for allowing sponsors such as Coca-Cola (KO.N) and McDonald's to use the games to market their products, which are perceived to be unhealthy. John Lewicki, who oversees global Olympic sponsorship deals for McDonald's, said last year the company would reevaluate its Olympic relationship after changes to a rule that ended a marketing blackout for companies that sponsor athletes rather than the event itself. Shares of McDonald's rose $1.06, or about 0.7 percent on Friday. Reporting by Liana B.

Chinese-born Guo has recently unleashed a deluge of corruption allegations against high-level Communist Party officials and is facing multiple lawsuits in a number of different jurisdictions. Prosecutors in the northern city of Dalian on Friday filed a lawsuit against some staff of Beijing Pangu Investment on suspicion of duty encroachment and misappropriation of funds, Xinhua said citing judicial sources. On the same day in Kaifeng City in Henan province, prosecutors filed a suit against Guo-controlled Henan Yuda Real Estate company and its employees on allegations of loan fraud and bill acceptance, Xinhua added. Guo did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. However, he has previously said the main purpose of legal cases against him was to paint him as a criminal, bolstering an Interpol global  red notice  for his arrest, issued at Beijing's request in April. The move comes after the Dalian Xigang People's Court in China's northeastern Liaoning province on Friday handed down prison sentences to three employees, Lu Tao, Xie Honglin and Yang Ying, who were first detained in early 2015. Xie and Yang's sentences were wholly suspended. Guo has disputed the facts of the Dalian case. In a live-streamed online interview with U.S.-based Chinese-language political gossip site Mingjing News on Friday night, which lasted more than four hours, the Chinese-born businessman said the barrage of legal cases against him were designed to silence him.

Laying out his new Cuba policy in a speech in Miami, Trump will issue a presidential directive to reverse some of the loosened regulations that Obama introduced after a 2014 breakthrough between the two former Cold War foes, senior White House officials said. Trump, taking a tougher approach against Havana after promising to do so during the presidential campaign, will outline stricter enforcement of a long-time ban on Americans going to Cuba as tourists and will seek to prevent U.S. dollars from being used to fund what the new U.S. administration sees as a repressive military-dominated government. But, facing pressure from U.S. business and some of his fellow Republicans to avoid turning back the clock completely in relations with communist-ruled Cuba, he also will leave intact many of Obama’s steps toward normalization. The new policy will ban most U.S. business transactions with the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group (GAESA), a sprawling conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy, but make some exceptions, including for air and sea travel, the officials said. This will essentially shield U.S. airlines and cruise-ship companies now serving the island. However, Trump will stop short of closing embassies or breaking diplomatic relations restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility and will not cut off recently resumed direct U.S.-Cuba commercial flights - though his more restrictive policy seems certain to dampen new economic ties. The administration, according to one White House official, does not intend to “disrupt” existing business ventures such as one struck under Obama by Starwood Hotels, which is owned by Marriott International Inc, to manage a Havana hotel. Nor are there plans to reinstate limits that Obama lifted on the amount of the island’s coveted rum and cigars that Americans can bring home for personal use. As a result, the changes – though far-reaching – appear to be less sweeping than many U.S. pro-engagement advocates had feared. Human Rights Trump will justify his partial reversal of Obama’s measures to a large extent on human rights grounds. His aides contend that Obama’s easing of U.S. restrictions amounted to  appeasement  and has done nothing to advance political freedoms in Cuba, while benefiting the Cuban government financially. Saying that the aim was to repair what Trump has called a “bad deal” struck by Obama, U.S. officials said the new administration would leave the door open to improved relations if Cuba undertakes democratic reforms such as allowing free elections and releasing political prisoners. International human rights groups say, however, that reinstating a U.S. policy of isolating the island could make the situation worse by empowering Cuban hardliners. The Cuban government has made clear it will not be pressured into reforms in exchange for further engagement with Washington. “If you want Cuba to change and reform, we are doing the opposite of what would be most likely to bring about reforms,” said Ben Rhodes, a former Obama aide who helped negotiate rapprochement. Trump’s critics have also questioned why his administration is now singling out Cuba for its human rights record while downplaying the issue in other parts of the world. Trump will announce his new approach early Friday afternoon at the Manuel Artime Theater in Miami’s Little Havana, the heart of America’s largest Cuban-American community, whose support aides believe helped him win Florida in the election. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a key player in forging the new policy, was expected to attend along with other Cuban-American lawmakers. Under Trump’s order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments will be given 30 days to begin writing new regulations and they will not take effect until they are complete. No deadline has been set, the officials said. Under the revised travel policy, U.S. officials say there will be tighter enforcement to make sure Americans legally fit the 12 authorized categories they claim to be traveling under, which could spook many visitors, wary of receiving a hefty fine. While tourism to Cuba is banned by U.S. law, the Obama administration had been allowing people to travel to Cuba as part of “people to people” educational trips for visitors, a popular classification that a White House official said was “ripe for abuse” by those looking for beach vacations. Trump’s new policy will eliminate such self-certified visits by individuals while still allowing them to be done as group tours, and also retaining some individual travel under other authorized categories such as religious, artistic and journalistic activities, officials said. In a contentious internal debate, some aides argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. business and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a campaign promise to Cuban-Americans.

Rodney Kelly is seeking the return of four spears from the university’s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology on behalf of the Gweagal people, who traditionally inhabited southern parts of Sydney, Australia's largest city. According the to the university, Cook took the spears following a violent first encounter between Aborigines and Europeans on the shores of Botany Bay in Sydney in 1770. He also took a shield, which is currently held by the British Museum and for which Kelly has also sought repatriation.  The artifacts are recognized as a significant symbol of first contact between the British and indigenous Australians and of Aboriginal resistance to colonization. However, the University of Cambridge has rejected a request for their return lodged by Kelly.   Removing parts of the Cook-Sandwich collection, which is of great historical, scientific and educational importance nationally and internationally, would cause considerable harm by depriving the collection of its integrity,  a spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters on Saturday. The university said the request contained no clear proposal for housing and conserving the spears if they were to be returned, and added it was important that any request for change be made with  accredited representatives of the Gweagal people . Kelly, who submitted a formal request for the repatriation of the spears in November last year, claims to be a direct descendant of the Gweagal warrior Cooman, from whom he claims the spears and shield were taken. However, a report prepared by the University of Cambridge has questioned Kelly’s ability to prove his descent - something disputed by the Sydney man.  It makes me angry they are trying these tactics to discredit me and my history,  Kelly told Reuters in an interview. Cook's landing in Botany Bay on April 29, 1770 marked the first point of contact between the British and Aborigines and preceded the arrival of the first waves of colonists to Australia eight years later. Two Aboriginal men holding spears tried to resist Cook’s party landing and one was injured by British musket fire, the university says. The Gweagal then retreated and Cook and his crew entered their camp and took the spears and a shield. According to Kelly, Cooman was the injured man in the historical account, a claim the university says is not well-supported. Both the Australian Senate and state parliament of New South Wales voted last year to support the repatriation of the artifacts from the British Museum and the Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Kelly said he would continue to fight for the artifacts' return.  I want to do everything I can to bring those artifacts home for my people and every indigenous and non indigenous person in Australia,  he said.

The secretive Islamic State leader has frequently been reported killed or wounded since he declared a caliphate to rule over all Muslims from a mosque in Mosul in 2014, after leading his fighters on a sweep through northern Iraq. If the report does prove true, it would be one of the biggest blows yet to Islamic State, which is trying to defend its shrinking territory against an array of forces backed by regional and global powers in both Syria and Iraq. But in the absence of independent confirmation, some U.S. officials said U.S. agencies were skeptical of the report. Several Iraqi security officials said Iraq was doubtful as well.  His death has been reported so often that you have to be cautious till a formal Daesh statement comes,  a European security official said, using an Arabic acronym for the group.  U.S. Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said:  We have no information to corroborate those reports.  A senior Trump administration official noted “a number of infirmities” in the reports, which have given U.S. officials reason to question their accuracy. “Some of those infirmities suggested that this happened at the end of May and that there were upwards of 300 or more soldiers killed in that strike,” said the official, who asked not to be identified. “A strike of that size and that claim that would have happened that long ago without any knowledge is something that made me curious,” the official added. The Russian Defence Ministry said on its Facebook page that it was checking information that Baghdadi was killed in the strike on the outskirts of Raqqa in Syria, launched after Russia received intelligence about a meeting of Islamic State leaders.  On May 28, after drones were used to confirm the information on the place and time of the meeting of IS leaders, between 00:35 and 00:45, Russian air forces launched a strike on the command point where the leaders were located,  the statement said.  According to the information which is now being checked via various channels, also present at the meeting was Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was eliminated as a result of the strike,  the ministry said. Operating Cautiously However, a colonel with the Iraqi national security service told Reuters Baghdadi was not believed to have been in Raqqa at the time of the strike in late May. One of Baghdadi's aides may have been killed rather than Baghdadi himself, the colonel said. He said that Baghdadi was believed to be operating cautiously in the border area between Iraq and Syria with just a handful of close aides, and avoiding using telecommunications equipment to evade surveillance. Another Iraqi intelligence official said the Russians had not shared any information with Iraqi authorities to indicate Baghdadi was killed. Iraq was checking the report and would announce his death if it received  solid confirmation . Hoshiyar Zebari, a long-serving former Iraqi foreign minister and now a senior adviser to the government of the Kurdish autonomous region, also told Reuters there was no confirmation of Baghdadi's death. The Russian defense ministry statement said the strike was believed to have killed several other senior leaders of the group in addition to Baghdadi, as well as around 30 field commanders and up to 300 of their personal guards. The IS leaders had gathered at the command center, in a southern suburb of Raqqa, to discuss possible routes for the militants' retreat from the city, the statement said. The United States was informed in advance about the place and time of the strike, the Russian military said. Close to Defeat  Islamic State fighters are close to defeat in the twin capitals of the group's territory, Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, after nearly three years ruling over millions of people in a wide swathe of territory in both countries. Russia supports the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, which is fighting against Islamic State fighters, one front in a multi-sided civil war. The United States supports Kurdish and Arab fighters in Syria who are separately planning an assault on Raqqa. In Iraq, the U.S.-backed government has been battling to recapture Mosul since October last year after driving the group out of most of the rest of the territory it had seized. The last public video footage of Baghdadi shows him dressed in black clerical robes declaring his caliphate from the pulpit of Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque back in 2014. Born Ibrahim al-Samarrai, Baghdadi is an Iraqi in his mid-forties, who broke away from al Qaeda in 2013 after years participating in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq and the Iraqi government. The U.S. State Department has offered a $25 million reward for information leading to his arrest. A number of senior IS figures have been killed in air strikes or special forces raids since the United States launched its campaign against the group in 2014, including Baghdadi's deputy Abu Ali al-Anbari, the group's  minister of war  Abu Omar al-Shishani, and its media director Abu Muhammad al-Furqan. Rami Abdulrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, cast doubt on the report Baghdadi may have been killed. He said that according to his information, Baghdadi was located in another part of Syria at the end of May. “The information is that as of the end of last month Baghdadi was in Deir al-Zor, in the area between Deir al-Zor and Iraq, in Syrian territory,” he said by phone.

Diagrams in a brochure dated 2016 for Reynobond tiles reviewed by Reuters show how polyethylene (PE) core tiles are suitable only for buildings of up to 10 metres in height.  As soon as the building is higher than the fire fighters' ladders, it has to be conceived with an incombustible material,  the brochure says. The brochure was issued by French-based Arconic Architectural Products, which is responsible for the marketing in Europe of systems produced by U.S. company Arconic, which owns Reynobond. The Guardian and the BBC have reported in recent days that panels with a PE core were used in a refurbishment of the 24-storey tower bock that was completed last year. Construction company Rydon Group, which undertook the work, and the local authority which owns Grenfell Tower declined to confirm whether the panels were PE. Arconic did not respond to requests for comment. Rydon had earlier said the revamp  met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards . Other diagrams in the Reynobond brochure show that panels with a fire retardant core -- the FR model, according to Arconic's website -- can be used for buildings of up to 30 metres tall. Above that height, it says, panels with a non-combustible core -- the A2 model -- should be used. Grenfell Tower is over 60 metres tall. Documents submitted in 2015 by the local authority's property division to its planning division seeking approvals for the refurbishment said the concrete and brick building would be clad in Reynobond insulation panels. John Cowley, director of Omnis Exteriors which supplied the padding for the refurbishment but did not install it, told the Guardian that the company had been asked to supply the Reynobond PE variant. The newspaper said the PE panels were 2 pounds ($2.56) cheaper per square metre than the Reynobond FR option. Reuters has not been able to confirm independently whether the PE panels were ultimately used or whether the use of PE-core panels is legal in Britain. Fire safety experts say polyethylene is generally avoided in tall buildings as it has been linked to a number of rapidly spreading fires at skyscrapers in Dubai and elsewhere.  Polyethylene is a thermoplastic material, which ... melts and drips as it burns, spreading the fire downwards as well as upwards,  architectural consultants Probyn Miers said in a note on insulation materials posted its website. Witnesses to Wednesday's blaze said the flames spread quickly up the building, which was left a charred shell. The London Fire Brigade has yet to say what the cause of the fire was. Building regulations documents did not specifically say PE-core panels should not be used, but three industry experts interviewed by Reuters said that did not mean builders were clearly permitted to use them. That is because British safety regulations across many industries are usually principles- rather than rules-based. This means the law often requires companies to act safely without giving a specific definition of what this would involve, said Christopher Miers of Probyn Miers. Firms are instead expected to be able to prove in court that they behaved in a way that their industry would consider safe, given current knowledge and technology, these experts added.

The comments by Lee Hsien Yang, made on his Facebook account, followed those made by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday that there were  serious questions  and  deeply troubling circumstances  over how the final will of their father, Lee Kuan Yew, was drawn up. The prime minister's office was not immediately available for comment on Saturday. The feud between the children of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first prime minister, over the future of the family home erupted publicly this week in a flurry of accusations and denials through press releases and Facebook postings, which also touched  on Lee Hsien Loong's leadership. Both Lee Hsien Yang and his sister Lee Wei Ling say they had lost confidence in their older brother as a leader and feared that state power would be used against them in their dispute with him. The prime minister has denied these allegations, and said he was very disappointed that they have chosen to publicize private family matters. In his last will, part of which was released by Lee Hsien Yang on Thursday, Lee Kuan Yew, who ruled Singapore for three decades, said he wanted his house, a humbly furnished home near the bustling Orchard shopping district, to be demolished. Lee Hsien Loong questioned in a six-page timeline whether Lee Kuan Yew knew a clause about the demolition, which was removed in the fifth and sixth versions of the will, was re-instated in the seventh and final will, saying there was no evidence that he did. The prime minister said he had recused himself from all government decisions regarding the house, and in his personal capacity, would also like to see Lee Kuan Yew's wish honored.     His brother Lee Hsien Yang said on Saturday Lee Kuan Yew's final will was engrossed on the basis of Lee Kuan Yew's  express instruction  to revert to his first will, attaching to the statement what appeared to be an email message from Lee Kuan Yew that states his plan to sign it before a solicitor.  Lee Kuan Yew's final will was simply Lee Kuan Yew's first will of 20 Aug 2011 re-executed on his instruction,  Lee Hsien Yang said on his Facebook account.

The Kansas City center fielder drove in the only two runs that Los Angeles starter Jesse Chavez allowed in seven innings. Then in the top of the eighth against Angels reliever Keynan Middleton, Cain led off with his second homer that helped the Royals extend their winning streak to six with a 3-1 victory. Cain had a home run and an RBI single against Chavez, continuing the torrid pace he has been on since the start of the month. With three more hits, Cain is batting .368 (21-for-57) with eight homers, 16 RBIs and 18 runs scored in June.  I'm just swinging at better pitches,  Cain said of his recent success.  Laying off the sliders in the dirt, laying off the bad pitches, just being able to do damage with the pitches when I get a chance to hit 'em.  Likely Cain's biggest fan was Royals starter Ian Kennedy, who began the night looking for his first win of the season. Kennedy was 0-6 with five no-decisions in his 11 starts. Kennedy was perfect through 5 2/3 innings, retiring the first 17 batters he faced until Cliff Pennington crushed a 91 mph fastball on a 3-1 count, hitting the ball into the right-field seats for his first home run of the season. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at AngelsKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatch I know Cliff pretty well,  Kennedy said.  I told him he's a terrible friend. I'm deleting his phone number from my phone.  That not only ended the no-hit and shutout bids but also seemed to crack the door open for the Angels' offense, if only temporarily. Cameron Maybin followed with a double and Kole Calhoun walked. Kennedy fell behind in the count 3-1 to Albert Pujols but got the final out of the inning on a pop to second. Kennedy was finished after the sixth and relied on the bullpen -- Mike Minor (seventh inning), Joakim Soria (eighth) and Kelvin Herrera (ninth, 14th save) -- to finish the game and preserve win No. 1.  It was only matter of time,  Kennedy said of getting his first win.  I felt really good my last start and I worked through some of those bad habits I created when I was trying pitch through my injury (strained hamstring in May) and try to do things to just be able to go out there.  Kennedy's best performance of the season before Friday came April 16 when he shut out the Angels on two hits in eight innings, only to come away with a no-decision.  He had good command tonight, in and out, changed some speeds and we didn't get too many good looks at him,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said of Kennedy.  We had three or four balls hit hard, but he worked the corners, worked the fringes, got underneath some swings. In the sixth, we had some opportunities but just couldn't get that one hit.  Chavez had one of this best games of the season, giving up two runs while scattering nine hits in seven innings. He has been hit or miss in the majority of his 14 starts this year -- he has allowed five runs or more four times but two runs or fewer seven times, including Friday.  Jesse's success is really contingent on making pitches,  Scioscia said.  What we're hopeful of is as he gets into that third time around the order, that 18th, 19th out where he can finish seven like he did, then he's going to have success.  He's pitched this deep before in games. Tonight he had good rhythm and good tempo and made pitches. Jesse keeps trying to evolve as a pitcher and I think he did some things tonight that will continue to move him forward.  The Royals took a 1-0 lead on Cain's two-out homer in the third inning, marking the third consecutive game that Cain has homered. In the fifth, the Royals got a leadoff single from Alex Gordon and a perfectly-placed, hit-and-run single to right field by Whit Merrifield, moving Gordon to third. Merrifield, though, was doubled up at first base after Pennington made a leaping catch of Jorge Bonifiacio's line drive at second. Chavez, though, couldn't get out of the inning unscathed because Cain followed with a two-out single to right field, scoring Gordon to put Kansas City up 2-0. NOTES: Angels RHP Cam Bedrosian, the club's closer to start the season but on the disabled list since April 22 with a strained groin, is expected to be activated from the disabled list. Angels manager Mike Scioscia said only that Bedrosian would be used in the  back end  of the bullpen, not committing him to the closer's role right away. RHP Bud Norris has pitched well in the closer's role in Bedrosian's absence, logging 11 saves with a 2.59 ERA and .200 opposing hitters batting average. ... Royals LHP Danny Duffy, out since May 30 with a strained right oblique, threw a light side session and likely will throw again Sunday. If all goes well, he could begin facing live hitters in batting practice on Tuesday. Duffy was 4-4 with a 3.54 ERA in 11 starts before the injury. ... Angels OF Eric Young Jr. was not in the starting lineup for the first time since being called up to replace injured OF Mike Trout on May 29. Scioscia, who said he was giving Young a  breather,  started OF Ben Revere in Young's place. ...

It might well make or break their season. What they saw out of a long-lost rotation piece and a lineup perhaps finally coming together gave them a boost of hope. Right-hander Tyson Ross exceeded just about every expectation in his first start in 15 months, taking a no-hitter into the fifth inning of the Rangers' 10-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners. Ross, who hadn't pitched since Opening Day 2016 for San Diego because of shoulder problems that ultimately led to off-season surgery, allowed a run without giving up a hit in the first after walking the game's first hitter. After the walk, Ross retired the next nine hitters and 14 of the next 15. His official line was 5 2/3 innings pitched, two hits, two runs, three walks and five strikeouts. The victory was his first since Aug. 31, 2015, coincidentally against the Rangers at Petco Park.  I'm pretty stoic in my demeanor, but inside I was real excited to be out there, crossing over those white lines and being handed the ball,  Ross said.  It's been a long time coming, and I'm just happy I was able to do a good job for the team and put us in a position to win. Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at RangersSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatch It's a long road, it's tough to go through, and I'm happy to be back in action and I look forward to moving forward.  Ross, who signed with Texas as a free agent in January, received plenty of run support from an offense that accounted for 13 hits and combined to score seven runs in the third and fourth innings and three in the sixth on Carlos Gomez's three-run homer to center off reliever Zac Curtis. Gomez, who was activated from the disabled list before the game, went 2-for-5 with four RBIs. Jonathan Lucroy and Adrian Beltre each had two hits and two RBIs. For Beltre, the base hits represented 2,956 in his career. Robinson Chirinos led off the fourth with his eighth home run. The strikeout-prone Rangers only whiffed six times, snapping a string of 11 consecutive games in June with eight or more. Texas also welcomed Mike Napoli back from the DL. Napoli, with a base hit on Friday, is batting only .194, but he was swinging the bat better when he went down with a sore back.  When we put those guys back in the lineup -- Gomez, Beltre, Napoli -- the experience of these guys, there's no room to maneuver around,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said.  When we came out of spring training, that's what we envisioned: tough outs, hitters -- with two strikes, two outs -- grinding away being able to push runs across for us.  The Rangers also finally figured out Seattle left-hander James Paxton, who entered having logged three career outings of at least six scoreless innings against Texas, including in April, when he held the Rangers to two hits and one walk while striking out nine in eight innings. Paxton (5-2) gave up seven runs, seven hits and three walks while striking out four in 3 2/3 innings. Two consecutive two-out walks in the third were backbreakers for Paxton in the third. Elvis Andrus followed with an RBI double and Beltre drove in two with a base hit.  He just doesn't have any rhythm at all,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  Even the secondary stuff wasn't very sharp tonight as well. It is what it is. We've got figure it out. Everything looks like a struggle. He's a big part, trying to dig us out of this little hole we've created here. We've got to get him right, back on track.  While the Rangers' offense erupted, Ross and three relievers limited the Mariners to seven hits. Mike Zunino had the Mariners' first hit, in the fifth, but Texas lefty Dario Alvarez left the catcher stranded. Nelson Cruz broke out of an 0-for-11 skid with an RBI single in the sixth, and Jarrod Dyson had a solo home run in the seventh off Jose Leclerc, who surrendered two runs in an inning pitched. The Rangers sent nine to the plate in the third, scoring five runs with four hits and two walks. Paxton stayed in to face four more hitters in the fourth and was touched for two more runs. Chirinos led off the inning with a home run and Delino DeShields followed with a base hit. DeShields stole second and scored on Gomez's double to left. Paxton labored, finishing with 91 pitches in 3 2/3 innings, including 40 in the third inning.  Something's definitely not right,  said Paxton, who had a stint on the DL in May.  The past few starts you can tell something's not quite there. But I'm in the process of trying to figure out how to fix it.  There's no issue with my arm. I'm not hurt. Just timing's off.  NOTES: The Rangers made several roster moves before the game, starting with designating RHP Dillon Gee for assignment to make room on the 40-man roster for Ross. Texas also activated 1B Mike Napoli and OF Carlos Gomez from the DL and recalled LHP Dario Alvarez from Triple-A Round Rock. To make room, Texas put RHP Tony Barnette on the 10-day DL (sprained right ring finger) and optioned INF/OF Jurickson Profar and INF/OF Ryan Rua to Round Rock. ... Texas LHP Cole Hamels (oblique strain) gave up one hit in three innings and 35 pitches in an injury rehabilitation start on Friday for Double-A Frisco. He threw 22 more pitches afterward in the bullpen. ... Seattle recalled LHP Zac Curtis from Double-A Arkansas and optioned RHP Chase De Jong to Triple-A Tacoma. ... Seattle RHP Felix Hernandez (shoulder) will make his third rehabilitation start on Saturday with Tacoma. He's expected to throw 80-85 pitches. ... Mariners RHP Hisashi Iwakuma (shoulder) will make his second injury rehab start on Monday with Tacoma. ...

The seventh, though, may have been a wall scraper, but it was still enough for the Milwaukee Brewers. Eric Thames' solo shot to lead off the 10th inning bounced off the top of the wall in center field and gave the Brewers a 6-5 victory over the San Diego Padres.  That was about as close as it gets,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. Thames gave Milwaukee its fourth straight win when he got just enough of a 1-1 fastball by Ryan Buchter (3-3) for his 19th homer and was mobbed by his teammates as he crossed the plate. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at BrewersMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatch I hit it and was like 'I got under it.' Hopefully the wind is blowing out,  Thames said.  I saw it hit (the wall) and I saw the outfielder. I was kind of blowing a little bit and I guess it worked.  Travis Shaw, Keon Broxton and Manny Pina also homered for Milwaukee, which has outscored its opponents 62-24 in the first inning this season. This time, Milwaukee found itself in a 4-0 hole after Junior Guerra allowed a three-run homer to Wil Myers and a solo shot to Hunter Renfroe in the opening inning. He settled in from there, holding the Padres without a hit over his final five innings and finished with just two hits and four walks while striking out three.  Junior really settled down after the first inning,  Counsell said.  The command was a little off with his fastball and he fell behind in some counts. The pitch to Meyers was just a middle fastball really. They took advantage of some balls in the middle of the late.  Shaw put the Brewers on the board with a leadoff homer in the second and with two on in the fourth, Broxton tied the game with his ninth of the season and fourth in the last six games. Starter Miguel Diaz, who the Padres plucked out of the Brewers' system last winter in the Rule 5 draft, didn't make it out of the fourth. He allowed four runs on five hits and a walk with five strikeouts in his second big league start.  He was much better today,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  He was in the strike zone. Times like the home run to Broxton, you just don't want to miss there. It was just a bad spot to miss to him. He wasn't set up there. He was looking for a fastball up and out over. He just missed his spot and he paid the price for that missed spot. The Brewers had a golden chance to pull ahead in the seventh, putting two on with one out only for Domingo Santana to end the threat by bouncing into a double play. San Diego pulled ahead in the eighth on a solo home run from Yangervis Solarte but the Brewers answered in the bottom of the frame when Pina hit his third of the season, tying the game at 5. The bullpens took over from there. Jacob Barnes got out of the eighth without further damage, Corey Knebel struck out a pair in a scoreless ninth while Jared Hughes worked a perfect 10th for Milwaukee. The Padres' bullpen had held its own before Thames homered.

Betts homered on the first pitch of the eighth inning as the Boston Red Sox claimed a tense, 2-1 victory over the Astros at Minute Maid Park. Betts belted his 12th homer after Brian McCann hit the first pitch he saw from Boston starter Drew Pomeranz out to right field with one out in the seventh. Betts, who drilled the Harris (2-2) offering 394 feet into the Crawford Boxes in left field, also scored the first run for Boston (38-29) in the third inning, coming home on a two-out single by Mitch Moreland off Astros right-hander Mike Fiers. Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at AstrosBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatch I think it's huge anytime you come in and win game one, especially in a fashion like that,  Betts said.  It was a low-scoring game. It kind of shows that you can play with them even though they're good. We're good, too.  Fiers was terrific but so too was Pomeranz, who carried a three-hit shutout into the seventh before McCann parked his 10th homer. That closed the book on Pomeranz, who allowed one run on four hits and three walks with four strikeouts over 6 1/3 innings, only the second time this season he's recorded 19-plus outs.  I think he did a good job of hanging out on the outer part of the strike zone,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of Pomeranz.  We chased a little bit, got a few calls to go his way and he continued to execute his pitches and his game plan. He's got a pretty good breaking ball; he's got a good arm. He cuts the ball on occasion and right up to the very end he did a good job. We couldn't solve him.  The Astros (45-23) had ample opportunity to make inroads down the stretch. George Springer was erased at the plate for the final out of the sixth inning, unwisely trying to score on a sharp Carlos Correa single to Betts in right field.  He cuts down a run to finish the sixth, then the first pitch thrown in eighth, he gives us the lead,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said.  Just in a small snapshot, there's Mookie's skill set on both sides of the ball. He's a dynamic player. Those throws aren't just by coincidence. The work he puts in, he throws a strike from right field at a key point in the game right there.  With two runners in scoring position in the seventh, pinch-hitter Nori Aoki ended a splendid at-bat against Red Sox right-hander Joe Kelly (3-0) with a lineout to third base. In the eighth, with Jose Altuve at third base representing the tying run, Evan Gattis rolled into an inning-ending double play against righty Matt Barnes. Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel worked a perfect ninth inning for his 19th save. Fiers stranded runners in scoring position in the first (Dustin Pedroia) and second (Jackie Bradley Jr.) before bending in the third on the Moreland RBI single. But when Fiers induced a double-play ground ball from Red Sox catcher Christian Vasquez, it allowed him to erase Josh Rutledge, who singled, and cap the fourth. Fiers then retired the Red Sox in order in each of his final three innings.  I was locked in all game; I felt really good,  Fiers said.  Just another game of getting ahead in the count and being the aggressor. Not letting these guys get in too many hitters' counts and putting them away as early as you can and not try to go deep into the at-bat.  NOTES: Red Sox RHP Carson Smith had his scheduled rehab assignment for Sunday pushed back due to shoulder inflammation. Smith tossed a simulated inning earlier this week and was set to report to Triple-A Pawtucket for his first game since undergoing Tommy John surgery last May. ... A pair of Astros starters, LHP Dallas Keuchel and RHP Lance McCullers, appear poised to begin throwing programs in the coming days. Keuchel has been on the 10-day disabled list since June 5 with neck discomfort; McCullers since June 9 with lower back discomfort. ... Seeking a superior defensive option for fast playing surface against an Astros team that puts the ball in play, Red Sox manager John Farrell started 3B Josh Rutledge over Pablo Sandoval, who has a June slash line of .129/.206/.258.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-redsox-astros-writethru-idUSMTZED6HOANHXB"},

Elkington, the 1995 PGA Championship winner, suggested that McIlroy had lost interest in adding to his collection of four major championships.  Rory is so bored playiing golf...without Tiger the threshold is prolly 4 majors with 100mill in bank,  Elkington wrote on Twitter.  Nobody more gifted than Rory...

The exchange came after McIlroy struggled to avoid the brutal Erin Hills rough in a shocking first-round 78 en route to an early exit from the year’s second major. For the first time since 1974, four players head into the weekend tied atop the leaderboard, with Americans Brooks Koepka and Brian Harman and English duo Paul Casey and Tommy Fleetwood  locked at seven-under 137.

The wind is also forecast to be light all day, so birdies should again be plentiful.

Carlos Carrasco (7-3) cruised through five innings before some late trouble, but the right-hander left after 6 1/3 innings and gave up one run on four hits as Cleveland climbed within a game back of the American League Central-leading Twins.  He's probably pretty damn close to where he was last year,  Indians manager Terry Francona said of Encarnacion.  He had a really slow start, but that slow start's over.  Related CoveragePreview: Indians at TwinsCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchIn his first season in Cleveland, Encarnacion hit .200 with four homers in 24 April games. He's become the big slugger in the heart of the order the Indians believed they were signing in the offseason and hit .337 (30-for-89) with nine homers and 19 RBIs in his last 25 games. Encarnacion gave Carrasco all of the support he would need with a big blast in the third. Jason Kipnis and Francisco Lindor reached on walks and Encarnacion hammered the first pitch he saw from rookie starter Nik Turley to the second deck in left-center field, an estimated 435 feet.  If you get something straight that's over the plate you always want to be ready to hit,  Francona said.  Edwin, that's kind of how you envision it, where with one swing you can kind of spread a game out. He certainly has been showing like he's got that in him, so that's been really, really good.  Turley (0-1) surrendered eight runs on nine hits and four walks in his second major league start for the Twins.  You can't defend walk, walk, homer,  Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said.  That's what's going to get you. He had a chance to keep us in the game there even after the Encarnacion homer and got two outs there in the fifth, and again, things kind of got away from him there.  Cleveland added four more runs in the fifth off Turley, with a two-run single by Yan Gomes and a two-run double from Lonnie Chisenhall.  Got two pretty quick outs and then things just started snowballing,  Turley said of the fifth.  Started trying to do a little too much instead of sticking with my game plan and staying within myself. There were a lot of emotions going on. It was just hard to control.  Carrasco hasn't fared well against Minnesota in his career (2-6, 4.76 ERA), but he was in control from the beginning on Friday. He struck out two batters in the first and allowed just one hit and two walks through his first five innings. Eddie Rosario homered for the only run off Carrasco to start the sixth inning. Brian Dozier and Miguel Sano added singles but Carrasco struck out Max Kepler to strand two runners. Carrasco finished with seven strikeouts.  Those guys went out there and got some runs, so the only thing we had to do as a pitching staff is come in there and throw up zeroes on the board,  Carrasco said.  That's what we try to do every game. That's what we're here for.  NOTES: Cleveland OF Brandon Guyer (left wrist sprain) was scheduled to start a rehab assignment with Triple-A Columbus. ... Minnesota LHP Hector Santiago (left shoulder strain) will throw another bullpen session on Saturday after coming out well from Thursday's 31-pitch sessions.

The Chicago manager was long gone, having been ejected from the game in the first inning, when the Cubs erupted for six runs in the ninth in a 9-5 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park. Madden still liked what he saw from the clubhouse.  That was pretty nice to watch,  Maddon said.  A lot of good opposite-field hitting there. Moving the ball the other way is what really stood out. Up and down (the lineup), guys did a good job.  The Cubs, who blew an early 3-0 lead, trailed 4-3 entering the ninth. The damage, against three Pirates pitchers, was done by Willson Contreras (RBI double), John Jay (RBI single), Anthony Rizzo (two-RBI single) and Addison Russell (two-RBI double).  You just keep playing -- that's all you can do,  Russell said.  You can't get frustrated. We just kept playing, and eventually we came through when it counted and got a really nice win.  Koji Uehara (2-3) pitched a scoreless eighth for the win. Juan Nicasio (1-3) took the loss after giving up four runs and three hits in the ninth. Pittsburgh (30-37), which has lost two in a row, got three RBIs from Josh Bell on a homer and a triple. Andrew McCutchen drove in Bell with a single in the sixth for a 4-3 lead. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at PiratesMcCutchen doubled and scored on Francisco Cervelli's single in the ninth to make it 9-5 as the Pirates sent nine men to the plate but couldn't get a bigger rally going.  It was a roller-coaster ride,  Bell said.  It's too bad that we didn't come out on top, but just giving ourselves a chance in that last inning was fun.  Chicago (33-33) had lost 10 of its previous 11 road games and avoided matching a season low of two games below .500. Cubs starter Eddie Butler allowed four runs and four hits with three walks and no strikeouts through 5 2/3 innings after initially shutting down the Pirates. Butler did not allow a hit through 3 1/3 innings. He pitched to the minimum number of batters to that point. McCutchen was the only runner during that stretch with a two-out walk in the second, but he was picked off first. Pittsburgh starter Trevor Williams, who was 2-1 in his previous six starts, allowed three runs and four hits, all in the first inning, with three strikeouts and two walks. The first eight Cubs batters reached -- two walks, two singles, two double and two fielder's choices. Williams then retired 12 in a row before leaving for a pinch hitter in the fifth after throwing 76 pitches.  (Catcher Francisco Cervelli) came up to me and just said, 'Why are you trying so hard? Why are you trying to do too much?'  Williams said.  It's a reminder that I've been trying to work through this entire year.  I've been trying to make perfect pitches, especially early. You can't make perfect pitches every time. It's just about execution.  (Cervelli) reminded me, and it really got me back to center and I figured out how to become the pitcher I am.  Things got heated quickly when Rizzo, the first batter of the game, hit a 1-1 ball over the right-field stands and into the Allegheny River on one bounce. It was initially called a homer -- it would have been his third leadoff homer in as many games -- but was changed by the umpiring crew to a foul ball. Maddon was among the Chicago contingent who argued vehemently, and he got ejected.  Rizzo hit a home run that was called fair, so that's the call on the field,  Maddon said.  They get together, whereas instant replay is available, and somehow decided the ball was foul. Nobody was definitive about it.  They might have thought it was foul, but nobody was sure it was foul. If it would be foul (by replay review), I would have been in the game for nine innings. It wasn't followed by procedure and they basically neutered instant replay by not (having a video review).  Rizzo eventually walked, and while he was later thrown out at third, Chicago scored three times in the first. Ian Happ scored from third on a wild pitch and Contreras doubled in two runs for a 3-0 lead, although he was out at third trying for a triple to end the inning. Pittsburgh didn't manufacture anything out of its first hit, a one-out single by Josh Harrison in the fourth, but its second hit off Butler was Bell's leadoff homer to left-center in the fifth, making it 3-1. In the sixth, Bell chased Butler with a two-out, two-RBI triple off the right-field wall to tie it 3-3.  I started to get tired,  Butler said.  I lost some velocity in that inning, but I still could have gotten through it if I had located my pitches better. I kept trying to get that third out and I just never got it.  McCutchen greeted reliever Pedro Strop with an infield single, bringing home Bell for a 4-3 Pirates lead. NOTES: Chicago 2B Ben Zobrist was put in the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to Tuesday, because of left wrist inflammation. ... The Cubs recalled 3B Tommy La Stella from Triple-A Iowa to take Zobrist's roster spot. ... Pittsburgh signed RHP Shane Baz, the 12th overall selection in the draft earlier in the week.

Before Cubs RHP and starter Eddie Butler threw a pitch, there was a delay while a trainer came to the mound and cut away his long, white sleeves under his uniform top after the Pirates objected because of the advantage it might offer with the white ball. ... The teams honored the Negro Leagues as part of an African-American heritage celebration, with the Pirates wearing Homestead Grays throwback uniforms and Chicago wearing Leland Giants throwback uniforms.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cubs-pirates-writethru-idUSMTZED6HO8O1TX"},

Avila broke the dam open with a home run leading off the fourth inning Friday night and the Detroit Tigers used a consecutive five-run frames to register a 13-4 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays. Nick Castellanos drove in four runs with a double and a triple and Justin Upton drove in three with two hits while Daniel Norris (4-4) allowed two runs on six hits through six innings. Norris was taken out after giving up a triple to right center by Mallex Smith plus an RBI single to Daniel Robertson to begin the seventh.  We weren't getting the results but we were having good at-bats,  Upton said.  That's all you can ask for. Alex kind of opened things up and we went from there.  Avila's 10th home run of the season came on a 1-2 slider that he drove the other way and over the left field wall for a 2-2 tie. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at TigersTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch Batting second, you can't swing at every first pitch every time,  Avila said.  And you can't go up and take the first pitch every time. Usually when an inning like that happens, pitchers are making mistakes and you're hitting them.  Sometimes you get a bloop or a misplay that keeps the inning going.  Erasmo Ramirez (3-2) gave up a leadoff home run to Ian Kinsler but then set down nine straight batters before Avila's home run knocked down the barrier. Kinsler's home run was his fifth of the season, third leading off a game and 43rd of his career, putting him sixth all-time on that list.  Their bats just came to life,  Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said.  They had a lot of hard-hit balls. He just threw too much over the white (of the plate). We like our pitchers to attack, attack, attack.  And obviously there's a fine line in there, especially against some of these hitters that can hit the ball really hard. Looked a couple pitches were up in the zone and a couple, from the Jumbotron feed, looked middle, middle.  Once manager Brad Ausmus plucked Norris from the game, Warwick Saupold came in to throw a double play grounder. He also worked the eighth, with Daniel Stumpf pitching the ninth and giving up a run on a sacrifice fly to center by Robertson. Norris struck out eight and walked one. The Tigers exploded for five runs in the fourth to take a 6-2 lead and added five more in the fifth for an 11-2 margin. Ramirez gave up nine hits in 4 2/3 innings with two walks (one intentional) and two strikeouts. Miguel Cabrera walked after the Avila home run and J.D. Martinez singled to right. Upton lined an RBI double to center and Castellanos lined a two-run double to extreme left. James McCann added a sacrifice fly. Upton got the scoring started in the fifth with a two-run double to left. Austin Pruitt relieved and two runs scored on a two-out throwing error on a ground ball to short by McCann while Jose Iglesias grounded an RBI single to drive in the last of three unearned runs in the inning. Castellanos hit his two-run triple with two out in the sixth to make it 13-2.  Avila comes up and hits the home run to lead that inning off. Then a four-pitch walk to Cabrera,  Cash said.  That's a little telling to me. The hard hits are going to happen. We got to avoid that walk to extend the inning and allow Martinez, Castellanos, and Upton all those guys come up there to bang.  The Rays tied the score, 1-1, in the third when Peter Bourjos tripled to right and scored on a fielder's choice grounder to third by Steven Souza Jr. when Castellanos threw wildly to the plate on the play. Logan Morrison walked to start the fourth and scored on singles by Smith and Robertson off Norris, giving Tampa Bay a 2-1 lead. Smith tried a steal of home in the fourth but his lead was too short and he was thrown out 1-3-2.  I'm fine with that,  Cash said.  Looking back on it, ideally, he's thinking along with the game. We got a 2-1 lead doing everything we can to extend it, make it 3-1. NOTES: SS Tim Beckham returned to Tampa Bay's starting lineup Friday night after missing most of three games with a sore right knee. He entered as a pinch-hitter Thursday night in the eighth. ... Detroit placed DH Victor Martinez on the 10-day disabled list Friday with irregular heartbeat, bringing up C/1B John Hicks for the third time this season. ...

Bour hit his 11th career homer off the Braves in his first game back from the disabled list and Straily pitched 6 1/3 masterful innings to lead the Miami Marlins to a 5-0 victory. Straily (5-4) allowed four hits, walked none and struck out eight as he bounced back from a rough game in his previous start at Pittsburgh to lower his ERA to 3.58.  He kind of kept them off balance. Couldn't really ask for anything much more than that,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said of Straily's outing.  I was able to control my fastball more than anything,  said Straily, who was 14-8 with a 3.76 ERA for Cincinnati last season.  That was something, after the last couple of starts, that we kind of focused on. It's something I was frustrated with. It comes down to fastball command, and other stuff plays a lot better.  It was the 13th victory in the past 18 games for the Marlins (30-35). The only time the Braves got a runner into scoring position was when Ender Inciarte doubled leading off the first inning. He moved up on a ground out, but Straily struck out Nick Markakis and Tyler Flowers to end Atlanta's lone threat. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at BravesMiami Marlins - PlayerWatch The last thing you want is to start with a runner on third and one out,  Straily said.  You just have to find a way to keep him from scoring. I was fortunate enough to have a couple of strikeouts and get out of the inning.  Bour hit his 17th homer in his second at-bat since being activated from the disabled list because of a left ankle contusion. He tied Giancarlo Stanton and Marcell Ozuna for the team lead. Rookie left-hander Sean Newcomb (0-2) took the loss in his second start but again showed the promise the Braves (29-37) were hoping to see.  He set the bar pretty high in the first one and I thought it was pretty good again,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  This is a hot team (he faced). They've been playing good and scoring a lot of runs.  Newcomb, who hit 100 mph four times, allowed three runs, five hits and four walks, striking out three. The 23-year-old made his major league debut Saturday by allowing just four hits and an unearned run in 6 1/3 innings of a loss to the New York Mets. He struck out seven and walked two in that game. The Marlins had two hits and drew three walks in the sixth inning, but Newcomb limited the damage. The only run scored on a double play.  I liked what I saw there. He competed very well,  Snitker said. Christian Yelich's two-run single, his third hit, padded the Marlins' lead in the ninth. Gordon also had his third hit in the inning. Marlins relievers Jarlin Garcia, David Phelps and Kyle Barraclough retired eight straight batters to close out the victory. The Braves scored 29 runs in taking two of three games at Washington early in the week, but they have scored just three runs while losing their past four home games. Gordon led off the game with a single for Miami and, after a stolen base, scored on a one-out double by Yelich. After walking the next batter, Newcomb retired 10 straight batters before Bour connected with a high fastball clocked at 97 mph in the fourth inning, sending it over the fence in center field for a 2-0 Marlins lead. Since winning their first four games at SunTrust Park, the Braves are 9-18 and have been outscored 160-103.  He was just really good changing speeds and we didn't really get any good swings on him all night,  Snitker said of Straily.  We had a real good game pitched against us.
