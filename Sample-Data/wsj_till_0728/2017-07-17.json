[{"content": "Over the years when             Procter & Gamble Co.       wasn\u2019t able to sell more Tide or Pampers, the company could at least point to one clear success: a sweeping, $10 billion cost-cutting plan executed ahead of schedule.Now that victory is murky.Activist investor       Nelson Peltz       said Monday that he would seek a single board seat in a shareholder vote at the company\u2019s annual meeting in October, making             P&G        PG 0.45%       the largest company to ever face a proxy fight.Mr. Peltz\u2019s Trian Management Fund argues that             P&G        PG 0.45%       failed to capitalize on a five-year savings plan that shrank the company by tens of thousands of employees, more than a dozen factories and hundreds of brands. Trian casts doubt on whether a second, five-year, $10 billion savings plan announced by         P&G               last year will produce results.On Monday,         P&G               began mounting its defense, first pointing to a series of metrics outlining the company\u2019s improved profit margin, leaner structure and healthy cash generation.\u201cOver the past two years,         P&G               has accomplished the most significant portfolio transformation in its history,\u201d the company said. \u201cToday,         P&G               is a leaner, more agile, more accountable and more efficient organization.\u201dThe company also criticized Trian, arguing the hedge fund \u201chas not provided any new or actionable ideas to drive additional value for         P&G               shareholders beyond the continued successful execution of the strategic plan that is in place.\u201dTrian, in meetings with P&G Chief Executive       David Taylor       and other managers, offered no specific suggestions on how the company could better optimize cost savings, and was generally complimentary, according to people familiar with the situation. P&G ultimately saw no value in adding Mr. Peltz to the board, they said.Mr. Peltz first spoke with Mr. Taylor on Feb. 16, two days after his firm disclosed its investment in the company. Over the next four months, Mr. Peltz spoke with executives and board members a number of times, according to a regulatory filing.Among the discussions was an hour-long meeting on May 4 between Mr. Peltz and P&G\u2019s top 30 executives, moderated by Mr. Taylor. Later that month, he told P&G that he didn\u2019t want to break up the company, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said.Throughout, Mr. Peltz maintained that P&G wasn\u2019t moving quickly enough and that a board seat would put him in better position him to help the company execute its plans. On July 11, Mr. Taylor and P&G\u2019s lead director, Jim McNerney, \u201clistened to Mr. Peltz\u2019s ideas, but did not agree to give him a Board seat,\u201d the filing said.The activist isn\u2019t saying explicitly it wants more costs cut than the $10 billion P&G has targeted, and isn\u2019t giving specifics on how it would tackle the costs. But Trian is concerned about whether the goal will be hit.Trian says years of P&G\u2019s underperformance in revenue and the stock market have raised questions about why the board should be given another year to execute without Mr. Peltz in the boardroom.Central to Trian\u2019s case is the fate of roughly $3 billion of the $10 billion in P&G\u2019s previous cost reductions. P&G said the other $7 billion in savings were lost to currency fluctuations, which Trian doesn\u2019t dispute.Trian argues, however, that if P&G were operating efficiently, the $3 billion would have shown up in increased sales and profit growth, both of which have been stalled for years.Trian is concerned the latest cost-cutting initiative \u201ccould be as ineffective as the 2012 productivity program in driving sales growth, earnings growth and shareholder creation,\u201d Trian said in a regulatory filing Monday.P&G shares were little changed Monday, rising less than 1% to $87.56 in late trading. The stock has gained 2% in the past 12 months, compared with a 14% return in the S&P 500.Gary Bradshaw,        a fund manager at Hodges Fund, said he would support Mr. Peltz for the board. \u201cI don\u2019t know he can change things overnight but, now, earnings aren\u2019t growing and that\u2019s what will eventually push the stock higher,\u201d said Mr. Bradshaw, whose fund has about 150,000 P&G shares.In a presentation to investors last month, P&G finance chief       Jon Moeller       said that cost-cutting alone won\u2019t be enough to turn around years of sluggish sales. To drive faster revenue growth, the Cincinnati-based company also needs to reinvest savings to improve product formulations and packaging, sales coverage and advertising, among other areas.Stagnation remains a challenge even as P&G is a dramatically different company today than five years ago. It has sold hundreds of brands and the bulk of its beauty business, including brands such as Clairol and Cover Girl, to beauty-product maker         Coty Inc.In April, the company first detailed plans for the second round of cutting it announced last year. P&G took heat from Wall Street after initially unveiling the plan with scant details about where the savings would come from. The biggest reductions will be in cost-of-goods sold, with $4.5 billion coming from materials, $1.5 billion in manufacturing expense and $1 billion in transportation and warehousing savings.An additional $3.5 billion would come from cuts to marketing and trade spending.Trian often focuses on cost structures at sprawling companies and is a proponent, for instance, of the zero-based-budgeting program that has won supporters and detractors among food companies.In negotiations with P&G, Trian argued that if it was given insider information and a role in the boardroom it could help guide Mr. Taylor and the board better, according to people familiar with the matter.In a similar situation Trian pushed         General Electric Co.       this year on its cost-cutting plans, leading to a disclosure from GE that it would target a spending number instead of a cost-cutting number. Trian had argued that would ensure the costs were eliminated for the bottom line, people familiar with the matter had said.Trian didn\u2019t seek a board seat at GE and its longtime chief executive,       Jeff Immelt,        recently announced plans to retire.\u2014David Benoit contributed to this article.Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   The graphic in a previous version of this story misspelled Procter & Gamble.

Signet says the claims have no merit.Signet, which operates Kay Jewelers, Jared and Zales stores, and Mr. Light believed it was the right time for change because of \u201chis personal need to address some health issues,\u201d company spokesman       David Bouffard       said. The health concerns aren\u2019t life-threatening, Mr. Bouffard said, but they have resulted in \u201cmultiple hospitalizations and a couple of surgical procedures.\u201d Mr. Light has served as CEO since 2014.Ms. Drosos, a former             Procter & Gamble Co.       executive, in 2014 was named CEO of Assurex Health, a genetics-testing company that was acquired in 2016 by             Myriad Genetics Inc.Signet directors began to consider Ms. Drosos as the company\u2019s next CEO a few months ago after realizing Mr. Light\u2019s medical condition was serious, said one person familiar with the company.Sounded out by fellow directors, Ms. Drosos \u201cexpressed some interest in doing it [the CEO job],\u201d this person said. Board members believed she had proven \u201can excellent contributor\u201d in discussing areas such as strategic initiatives and improving online sales.In addition, \u201cshe has had a lot of exposure to new marketing approaches\u201d at prior employers, this person said.Signet\u2019s board feared a formal external hunt for Mr. Light\u2019s successor would take too long. \u201cDoing a search for a CEO in the retail business today is not an easy task,\u201d this person said.

She began working at P&G in 1987 as an assistant brand manager.In a 2012 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Ms. Drosos said she believed her work reinvigorating several classic brands showed she had what it takes to lead a company.Analysts at Citi said in a client note that a CEO change makes sense given that Signet\u2019s 2014 acquisition of Zales hasn\u2019t gone smoothly, as well as the \u201cseveral public relations issues which may have hurt sales.\u201dThe analysts did question, however, why the board conducted only a limited, internal search for a successor and selected someone who \u201cdoes not have retail experience.\u201dThe company has faced scrutiny amid a class-action arbitration case alleging widespread discrimination against women employees in Signet\u2019s Sterling Jewelers unit. Employees have also raised claims of sexual harassment.

The company didn\u2019t admit wrongdoing in the settlement but committed to evaluate its pay and promotion practices, offer additional training to personnel and appoint a compliance officer.Shares of Signet Jewelers, down 35% over the past 12 months, fell 2.2% to $58.56 in Monday trading.\u2014Suzanne Kapner contributed to this article.Write to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com and Joann S.

Mike Lee       is known around the Capitol for keeping a low profile. When he joined fellow Republican Sen. Jerry Moran on Monday in torpedoing for now a GOP health bill, Mr. Lee reminded his colleagues that he was willing to press high-profile fights on principle at the risk of unsettling party leaders.The Utah Republican has, in fact, built a career on taking such firm stands.The youngest member of the Senate when he was elected in 2010 at the age of 39, Mr. Lee won his seat by defeating a better-funded, three-term Republican incumbent. Three years later, Mr. Lee worked with Sen.       Ted Cruz       of Texas in an attempt to stop the Affordable Care Act from taking effect, an effort that led to a government shutdown.In 2014, he backed Mr. Cruz in a fight that forced vulnerable Republicans up for re-election to cast votes to raise the U.S. borrowing limit, votes they had expected to escape.In each of those instances, Mr. Lee put himself on the opposite side of the party\u2019s powerful Republican leader, Sen.       Mitch McConnell       of Kentucky. Each time, Mr. Lee has stuck to a theme of being a conservative who has the courage of his convictions. Each time, Mr. Lee has readied arguments to explain his position, as he did again on Monday to say why he refused to agree to allow Republican leaders even to begin a Senate debate on the health-bill overhaul.\u201cIn addition to not repealing all of the Obamacare taxes, it doesn\u2019t go far enough in lowering premiums for middle class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations,\u201d Mr. Lee said in a statement explaining why he wouldn\u2019t cast a procedural vote in favor of the GOP bill.Mr. Lee was joined by Mr. Moran of Kansas, another low-key Republican lawmaker. But Mr. Moran isn\u2019t a maverick like Mr. Lee and is known for being a team player. He also has a reputation as being close to Senate Republican leaders, and recently headed the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm, making him part of the party\u2019s leadership.But Mr. Moran said Monday that the Republican bill wasn\u2019t a true repeal of the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, and that it didn\u2019t address the rising costs of health care.That two such different lawmakers would simultaneously announce their opposition showed the breadth of discontent with the bill in the Republican conference.Mr. Lee isn\u2019t known for seeking to bask in the spotlight. His past fights to block the ACA, or impose conditions on a debt-ceiling increase, or even his 2015 decision to side with Sen.       Rand Paul       (R., Ky.) over Mr. McConnell in a messy battle over renewing the Patriot Act, have typically involved letting other Republicans lead the charge.Even when Mr. Lee last year urged then-candidate       Donald Trump       to drop out of the presidential race, following the release of a an 11-year-old video showing the nominee making crass comments about women, Mr. Lee was at the vanguard but not the first to issue such a call.This time, Mr. Lee played to form. In coming out against a \u201cmotion to proceed\u201d to debating the GOP plan, he announced that Mr. Moran would take the same position. The maneuver had the effect of ensuring that neither man would be cast as the single deciding vote in stopping the GOP plan from coming to the floor.With a narrow 52-48 Senate majority, Mr. McConnell couldn\u2019t spare any more defections after two other Republicans\u2014Mr. Paul and Sen.       Susan Collins       of Maine\u2014had locked in their opposition. Mr. McConnell needs 50 Republicans, plus a tie-breaking vote cast by Vice President       Mike Pence,        to pass the GOP health plan, because no Democrats support the measure.For days, Mr. Lee had telegraphed his unease with the GOP health plan, which incorporated language proposed by Mr. Cruz to allow insurers to sell cheaper, bare-bones health insurance plans as long as they also sell plans that comply with the ACA. Republican leaders had tweaked the language of the Cruz provision, a change accepted by Mr. Cruz himself, who said he could vote to begin debate.But Mr. Lee was worried the change would prevent premium prices from falling enough.By Monday, it was clear that Mr. Lee\u2019s concerns were something for Republican Senate leaders to worry about. It was also clear that assumptions that Mr. Lee would vote in tandem with Mr. Cruz were off base.", "news_time": "2017-07-17 23:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/with-stand-against-health-bill-republican-mike-lee-hews-true-to-form-1500347286", "news_title": "With Stand Against Health Bill, Republican Mike Lee Hews True to Form", "keywords": "gop heath bill ,jerry moran ,mike lee ,obamacare repeal ,republican obamacare,Mike Lee,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "Tesla Inc.,        TSLA -0.91%       which has faced criticism from its investors about a lack of independent directors, named             21st Century Fox Inc.

Among the changes, the investors requested Tesla recruit two new directors who don\u2019t have prior personal or professional ties with Mr. Musk.Mr. Murdoch       is the son of Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of Fox and             News Corp,       publisher of The Wall Street Journal. James Murdoch, who also serves on the board of News Corp and is the chairman of Sky PLC, succeeded his father as CEO of Fox in 2015.Ms. Rice, who had been chairman emeritus of Ebony Media Holdings, returned to run the holding company that includes Ebony magazine earlier this year after selling the family-owned Johnson Publishing last year. She has been active on other boards, including as a director for             Omnicom Group Inc.       since 2000 and             GrubHub Inc.       She becomes Tesla\u2019s second female director.Dieter Waizenegger, the executive director of CtW Investment Group, which signed the April letter and represents union-sponsored pension funds that own about 200,000 Tesla shares, welcomed Ms. Rice\u2019s appointment, saying it adds diversity to the board. But Mr. Waizenegger raised concerns about       Mr. Murdoch,        citing his handling of the phone-hacking scandal at the U.K. newspaper unit of News Corp in 2011 when he was head of the international division, and more recently 21st Century Fox\u2019s controversy involving sexual-harassment claims at the Fox News Channel.Mr. Waizenegger said those issues mean       Mr. Murdoch       isn\u2019t an ideal candidate \u201cfor a board that really needs to prove that it wants to take up shareholder accountability several notches,\u201d he said.While       Mr. Murdoch       faced questioning by a U.K. parliamentary committee in the phone-hacking scandal, he wasn\u2019t accused of any wrongdoing.       Mr. Murdoch       in 2011 called the phone-hacking \u201ca matter of serious regret,\u201d and has said he didn\u2019t know about or try to hide any wrongdoing in the matter.At 21st Century Fox, the company has replaced much of the management at Fox News, has hired more women and minorities including a head of diversity outreach and provided sensitivity training for all employees at the network.A spokesman for Mr. Murdoch referred questions to the auto maker. Tesla declined to comment beyond its announcement Monday.A representative from Calstrs didn\u2019t have immediate comment. The second largest pension fund owns about 248,000 shares, or 0.15% of Tesla, according to the latest data from CapIQ.Three other pension funds that signed the letter to Tesla declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond to requests.Besides Mr. Musk, who is chairman, Tesla\u2019s board includes his brother; a former top executive for SolarCity Corp., where Mr. Musk has served as chairman; two longtime venture-capital investors in Tesla; a private-equity investor and a telecommunications executive.Mr. Musk is under intense scrutiny as he races to ramp up production of the Model 3, a new $35,000 sedan that he expects will fuel massive sales growth next year. He has projected Tesla will make a total of 500,000 vehicles in 2018, up from about 84,000 last year.Enthusiasm for the Model 3 has sent shares soaring more than 50% this year, though the stock has fallen in the past few weeks\u2014including 2.5% on Monday\u2014following disappointing second-quarter sales figures. On Saturday, Mr. Musk told a group of U.S. governors that he believed the company\u2019s market value was greater than Tesla deserved.On Monday, Mr. Musk clarified his comments on Saturday, tweeting: \u201cTesla stock is obviously high based on past & present, but low if you believe in Tesla\u2019s future. Place bets accordingly.\u201dHe also on Monday sought to put to rest news about a crash in Minnesota involving Tesla\u2019s semiautonomous Autopilot system. The driver of the 2016 Tesla car, which rolled over in a marsh, slightly injuring the four passengers, originally told police he engaged the car\u2019s semiautonomous system and the vehicle then suddenly accelerated. However, Mr. Musk posted an email he says is from the driver stating he believed he had disengaged Autopilot at the time of the crash.

Mike Lee       of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas said they would oppose their party\u2019s health-care overhaul, leaving Senate GOP leaders short of the votes needed to advance the bill and likely derailing President       Donald Trump\u2019s       top legislative priority of his first seven months in office.In a stinging defection for party leadership, Messrs. Lee and Moran on Monday night became the third and fourth Republicans to oppose the latest version of the GOP bill, which would roll back and replace much of the Affordable Care Act.Senate Republicans had already lost two GOP votes, from Sens.       Rand Paul       of Kentucky and       Susan Collins       of Maine, and the new opposition from Messrs. Lee and Moran means Senate leaders don\u2019t have enough support to advance the bill in a procedural vote.With 52 Republicans in the Senate, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) needed to secure at least 50 GOP votes, with Vice President       Mike Pence       casting a tiebreaking vote. No Democrats are expected to support the bill.\u201cIn addition to not repealing all of the Obamacare taxes, it doesn\u2019t go far enough in lowering premiums for middle-class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations,\u201d Mr. Lee, one of the Senate\u2019s most conservative Republicans, said in a statement Monday night.Mr. Moran said he objected to the process used to craft the Senate GOP health-care bill, which he said \u201cfails to repeal the Affordable Care Act or address health care\u2019s rising costs.\u201dTheir opposition casts what could be a fatal blow to a bill that was already under attack from multiple directions.Messrs. Lee and Moran are likely to face backlash from Mr. Trump and his supporters, who were eager to see Republicans keep their seven-year promise to repeal the 2010 health law.Their move comes as a surprise to many in Washington, since Mr. Moran rarely breaks with GOP leaders and Mr. Lee has often voted in step with Republican Sen.       Ted Cruz       (R., Texas), who introduced a key measure that GOP leaders incorporated into the bill last week.On Monday night, the White House issued a statement that repeated a stance the president\u2019s officials have taken in recent days\u2014that GOP senators have no choice but to act.\u201cInsurance markets continue to collapse, premiums continue to rise, and Obamacare remains a failure. Inaction is not an option,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe look forward to Congress continuing to work toward a bill the president can sign to end the Obamacare nightmare and restore quality care at affordable prices.\u201dRepublicans\u2019 struggle to pass a health-care bill has exposed divisions within the party that could imperil other key items on their legislative agenda, including their yearslong push to overhaul the tax code.Many had expected the next defection to come from the more centrist GOP senators, who have wavered over the latest version of the health-care bill, including Sens.       Dean Heller       of Nevada, who is up for re-election next year, and Republicans concerned about the bill\u2019s cuts to federal Medicaid funding, such as Sens.       Rob Portman       of Ohio and       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia.The health-care bill survived setbacks in the House, where GOP leaders had to pull it from the floor in late March, before finally passing it in May. But it is unlikely that Senate GOP leaders can pull off a similar comeback.To regain any chance of passing the bill,       Mr. McConnell       would have to flip the position of at least two of the four GOP opponents, all of whom have said the bill would need major alterations to secure their support. That would be a steep challenge at this point, following weeks of negotiations over the bill and the political danger facing a lawmaker perceived as flip-flopping on high-profile legislation.Democrats immediately responded to the defections by saying it was time for Republicans to begin to work with them on strengthening the health-care system.\u201cThis second failure of Trumpcare is proof positive that the core of this bill is unworkable,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Monday night. \u201cRather than repeating the same failed, partisan process yet again, Republicans should start from scratch and work with Democrats on a bill that lowers premiums, provides long term stability to the markets and improves our health-care system.\u201dRepublicans have been divided over how to proceed if the health-care bill collapses in the Senate. Some conservatives have pushed to vote just on repealing the ACA without reaching a consensus on what to replace it with. Influential members of the House Freedom Caucus, including its chairman, immediately called for such a vote on Twitter Monday night.Several other GOP senators called for a new approach on health care Monday night, with Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.) urging GOP leaders to solicit input from Democrats.Mr. Trump appeared late Monday night to urge the Senate GOP to take a more aggressive path and repeal the ACA first, which many GOP senators have balked at, before determining its replacement with the support of Democrats.\u201cRepublicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter Monday night.The downfall of the bill is a tough blow for Mr. Trump, who has made it clear that undoing the 2010 law is a priority and has leaned heavily on fellow Republicans to make it happen. Mr. Trump said recently he would be very angry if the repeal legislation didn\u2019t make it to his desk, and he was meeting Monday night with a handful of Republican senators to discuss the legislation.Earlier Monday, the president promised Republicans would replace the law with \u201csomething that is going to be outstanding\u201d and \u201cfar, far better than failing Obamacare.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to get that done,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think we\u2019re going to surprise a lot of people.\u201dFault lines have already emerged in both the House and the Senate over the way forward in the event of the bill\u2019s collapse.Conservatives are making it clear that they will redouble their push for a straightforward repeal of the 2010 law with an expiration date a year or two later, giving lawmakers time to craft a replacement. Some have hinted at attaching a repeal provision to a bill reauthorizing the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, a popular measure.The repeal-first approach faces long odds, however, given the current health law\u2019s support among Democrats and the desire among centrist GOP lawmakers to retain parts of it.Meanwhile, a half-dozen Democratic senators and at least one Republican, Ms. Collins, are looking at ways to stabilize the insurance marketplaces if the GOP bill fails, a move insurers are seeking. That could be part of a funding reauthorization for the children\u2019s health program, sources said.But conservatives would be loath to be seen as bailing out insurers or violating their campaign pledge to repeal the law, and disagreement has already surfaced over what steps would be necessary to help the markets.Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) has floated a proposal that would stabilize insurance markets and usher in greater flexibility in state regulation of insurers if the Republican measure fails.No matter the outcome, Mr. Trump\u2019s administration is likely to take administrative steps to roll back the 2010 law, including relaxed enforcement of the requirement that most people pay a penalty if they don\u2019t have health insurance.Health and Human Services Secretary       Tom Price       has already encouraged states to apply for waivers giving them more flexibility in enforcing the law and structuring their Medicaid programs. The waivers allow states to require many people to work to obtain their Medicaid benefits, among other changes.Insurers will immediately be looking for assurances that the cost-sharing subsidies will be paid, said       Larry Levitt,        a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. The drop-dead date for insurers will be mid to late September, when they have to sign contracts for 2018.The individual insurance market has been stabilizing in most of the country and could continue just fine, Mr. Levitt said, but insurers will be reading the tea leaves for whether the Trump administration will make the subsidy payments they are expecting and enforce the individual mandate.There are still some fragile markets, especially in rural areas, and they will likely require some shoring up to make sure insurers are participating and premiums are affordable, he said.Republicans have expended immense energy and time on their repeal efforts, pushing back their timeline for other agenda items including tax reform. Mr. McConnell delayed the Senate\u2019s summer recess for two weeks, until mid-August, because of the packed agenda.\u2014Michelle Hackman and Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'GOP Abandons Health Bill.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 22:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-more-gop-senators-oppose-health-care-bill-1500339268", "news_title": "Two More GOP Senators Oppose Health-Care Bill", "keywords": "aca,affordable care act,gop health bill,health law,jerry moran,mike lee,obamacare,senate ,senate republicans,Donald Trump,Mike Lee,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services"}, {"content": "Even       Donald Trump       might agree that a major reason he won the 2016 election is because voters couldn\u2019t abide       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       legacy of scandal, deception and stonewalling. Yet on the story of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election, Mr. Trump and his family are repeating the mistakes that doomed Mrs. Clinton.That\u2019s the lesson the Trumps should draw from the fiasco over Don Jr.\u2019s June 2016 meeting with Russians peddling dirt on Mrs. Clinton. First Don Jr. let news of the meeting leak without getting ahead of it. Then the White House tried to explain it away as a \u201cnothingburger\u201d that focused on adoptions from Russia.When that was exposed as incomplete, Don Jr. released his emails that showed the Russian lure about Mrs. Clinton and Don Jr. all excited\u2014\u201cI love it.\u201d Oh, and son-in-law       Jared Kushner       and Beltway bagman       Paul Manafort       were also at the meeting. Don Jr. told       Sean Hannity       this was the full story. But then news leaked that a Russian-American lobbyist was also at the meeting.Even if the ultimate truth of this tale is merely that Don Jr. is a political dunce who took a meeting that went nowhere\u2014the best case\u2014the Trumps made it appear as if they have something to hide. They have created the appearance of a conspiracy that on the evidence Don Jr. lacks the wit to concoct. And they handed their opponents another of the swords that by now could arm a Roman legion.Don\u2019t you get it, guys? Special counsel       Robert Mueller       and the House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating the Russia story. Everything that is potentially damaging to the Trumps will come out, one way or another. Everything. Denouncing leaks as \u201cfake news\u201d won\u2019t wash as a counter-strategy beyond the President\u2019s base, as Mr. Trump\u2019s latest 36% approval rating shows.Mr. Trump seems to realize he has a problem because the White House has announced the hiring of white-collar Washington lawyer       Ty Cobb       to manage its Russia defense. He\u2019ll presumably supersede the White House counsel, whom Mr. Trump ignores, and New York outside counsel       Marc Kasowitz,        who is out of his political depth.Mr. Cobb has an opening to change the Trump strategy to one with the best chance of saving his Presidency: radical transparency. Release everything to the public ahead of the inevitable leaks. Mr. Cobb and his team should tell every Trump family member, campaign operative and White House aide to disclose every detail that might be relevant to the Russian investigations.That means every meeting with any Russian or any American with Russian business ties. Every phone call or email. And every Trump business relationship with Russians going back years. This should include every relevant part of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, which the President will resist but Mr. Mueller is sure to seek anyway.Then release it all to the public. Whatever short-term political damage this might cause couldn\u2019t be worse than the death by a thousand cuts of selective leaks, often out of context, from political opponents in Congress or the special counsel\u2019s office. If there really is nothing to the Russia collusion allegations, transparency will prove it. Americans will give Mr. Trump credit for trusting their ability to make a fair judgment. Pre-emptive disclosure is the only chance to contain the political harm from future revelations.This is the opposite of the Clinton stonewall strategy, which should be instructive. That strategy saved       Bill Clinton\u2019s       Presidency in the 1990s at a fearsome price and only because the media and Democrats in Congress rallied behind him. Mr. Trump can\u2019t count on the same from Republicans and most of the media want him run out of office.If Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating stays under 40% into next year, Republicans will begin to separate themselves from an unpopular President in a (probably forlorn) attempt to save their majorities in Congress. If Democrats win the House, the investigations into every aspect of the Trump business empire, the 2016 campaign and the Administration will multiply. Impeachment will be a constant undercurrent if not an active threat. His supporters will become demoralized.Mr. Trump will probably ignore this advice, as he has most of what these columns have suggested. Had he replaced       James Comey       at the FBI shortly after taking office in January, for example, he might not now have a special counsel threatening him and his family.Mr. Trump somehow seems to believe that his outsize personality and social-media following make him larger than the Presidency. He\u2019s wrong. He and his family seem oblivious to the brutal realities of Washington politics. Those realities will destroy Mr. Trump, his family and their business reputation unless they change their strategy toward the Russia probe. They don\u2019t have much more time to do it.Appeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-17 21:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-trumps-and-the-truth-1500332545", "news_title": "The Trumps and the Truth", "keywords": "Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions,editorials"}, {"content": "CARACAS\u2014Venezuelan President       Nicol\u00e1s Maduro       came under growing pressure Monday as the opposition announced plans for a parallel government and U.S. President       Donald Trump       warned of sanctions if his government moves ahead with plans to rewrite the constitution.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the zero hour,\u201d the vice president of congress,       Freddy Guevara,        said at a news conference on Monday flanked by other foes of Mr. Maduro.Mr. Guevara called for a 24-hour strike\u00a0on Thursday, a day before lawmakers in the opposition-controlled National Assembly are scheduled to name replacements for some of the magistrates allied to Mr. Maduro on the country\u2019s top court.The opposition\u2019s new strategy came as the Trump administration said it would impose \u201cswift economic actions\u201d if Mr. Maduro goes ahead with a planned election on July 30 to the constituent assembly charged with rewriting the constitution.\u201cThe United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles,\u201d President Trump said in a statement. The president said Venezuelans\u2019 \u201cstrong and courageous actions continue to be ignored by a bad leader who dreams of becoming a dictator.\u201dPeople familiar with the discussions in the White House say the administration has been pondering sanctioning Venezuela\u2019s state-controlled oil company and its executives or taking an even tougher measure, such as finding a way to curtail the oil revenues on which Mr. Maduro\u2019s government depends.\u201cMy sense is there\u2019s an intensive review on a variety of options,\u201d said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington that tracks Venezuela. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised about discussions on very severe measures against the Venezuelan government. If so, I hope they do more good than harm.\u201dThe Trump administration hasn\u2019t publicly commented on the scope of its potential sanctions against Venezuela.More than 7.5 million Venezuelans at home and abroad cast ballots on Sunday in an unofficial plebiscite organized by the opposition\u00a0to serve as a mass repudiation of the unpopular Mr. Maduro\u2019s efforts to create a constituent assembly on July 30 that would redraft the constitution. The opposition, along with international human-rights groups and several governments, say the move is an attempt by the increasingly authoritarian leader to seize more power and bypass elections.Voters on Sunday were presented with three questions. More than 98% of those who voted were against the government on the constitution redo, urged the holding of general elections and demanded that the military, which has helped Mr. Maduro by cracking down on protesters during three months of deadly civil unrest, abide by the law.Mr. Guevara and other opposition leaders said they were working to create a \u201cgovernment of national unity,\u201d an alliance between longtime government foes and dissidents from within Mr. Maduro\u2019s ruling Socialist Party.\u00a0Some formerly loyal lieutenants in the government have openly broken with Mr. Maduro recently, saying he rules in a dictatorial manner.\u201cThis path that we\u2019re forced to take carries risk,\u201d opposition lawmaker       Juan Andr\u00e9s Mej\u00eda       said, regarding the creation of parallel institutions. \u201cThis state of national unity will not be recognized by everyone. The important thing is for it to be recognized by the people.\u201dMr. Maduro has alleged that all actions by the opposition amount to an effort to dislodge him undemocratically. His rivals are calling for immediate general elections that polls show the president and his allies would lose. The country is racked by sky-high inflation, chronic food shortages, rampant crime and an economy in contraction, making the government unpopular with four out of five Venezuelans, recent polls say.The turnout in\u00a0Sunday\u2019s\u00a0unofficial plebiscite was below the 7.7 million votes that put the opposition in control of congress in 2015. But organized with scant resources and without the support of state electoral authorities, the vote still provided a boost for the opposition as pressure mounts on Mr. Maduro to resolve Venezuela\u2019s debilitating economic and political crisis.Farmers and business leaders expressed cautious support on Monday for the opposition\u2019s call for the strike.Gabriela L\u00f3pez, a manicurist from a working class Caracas neighborhood of Catia, said business has fallen so much at her nail salon that it is almost not worth her showing up. \u201cYou might as well go on strike, if it gives any chance of getting rid of this government,\u201d she said.Francisco Mart\u00ednez, head of Venezuela\u2019s powerful business lobby, Fedecamaras, said members would be permitted to join the strike call. Celso Fantinel, vice president of Venezuela\u2019s agriculture association, Fedeagro, which grows about 75% of local crops, said that while not all farmers could abandon planting season, \u201cwe will come out to protest and to support the opposition.\u201dThreats of a strike have had mixed results for detractors of Venezuela\u2019s ruling Socialist Party. In 2003, Mr. Maduro\u2019s mentor and predecessor, the late       Hugo Ch\u00e1vez,        defeated a monthslong strike called by the opposition and Fedecameras, an event that polarized the nation and paved the way for the government to radicalize its leftist revolution.But with the Maduro administration now in dire financial straits and with record-low approval amid allegations of corruption and mismanagement, both the government and the opposition are raising the ante.If Mr. Maduro does go ahead with the new assembly, \u201cit will represent a new apex in the country\u2019s ongoing political crisis,\u201d said       Risa Grais-Targow,        a Washington-based analyst at the consulting firm Eurasia Group. Any such institution would have limited backing and be inherently unstable, likely increasing street protests, she said.\u201cThe country is on an inevitable path to a negotiated transition that prompts real regime change,\u201d Ms. Grais-Targow said.\u2014Ian Talley, Jos\u00e9 de C\u00f3rdoba and Juan Forero contributed to this article.Write to Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.com and Anatoly Kurmanaev at Anatoly.kurmanaev@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'Venezuela\u2019s Opposition Plans Parallel State.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 21:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelas-opposition-sets-general-strike-1500323383", "news_title": "Venezuela\u2019s Opposition Plans Parallel  Government ", "keywords": " venezuela constitution, venezuela general strike,venezuela opposition, venezuela plebiscite ,Freddy Guevara,Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "The abrupt delay of a vote on the Senate Republican health bill threw GOP plans into disarray Monday, as Republican leaders struggled to determine if they had the votes from wavering senators and how to proceed if they don\u2019t.With two Republican senators already opposed, the party\u2019s long-sought effort to topple most of the Affordable Care Act\u2014widely known as Obamacare\u2014was one additional GOP defection shy of defeat.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) was forced this weekend to delay a planned vote on the bill later this week after Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.) underwent surgery Friday for a blood clot. Mr. McCain had said he would take this week to recover, scuttling the planned vote on the bill, which had already been postponed once.The delay thwarted Mr. McConnell\u2019s plans for a rapid-fire vote before opponents had time to coalesce around a counteroffensive. Adding to the uncertainty, it isn\u2019t clear exactly when Mr. McCain would return to Washington.Republican Senators voiced additional reservations about the bill Monday. Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) said he was alarmed by a report that Mr. McConnell had told some senators, \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t worry about these Medicaid changes\u2014they\u2019ll never take effect.\u2019 \u201dMr. Johnson said he confirmed Mr. McConnell\u2019s comments with other senators, and he said the remarks could affect his vote.\u201cThat\u2019s troubling to me,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, calling the comments \u201cfrom my standpoint, a pretty serious breach of trust.\u201dMr. McConnell in a statement Monday didn\u2019t say whether he made the remark, but he defended the Medicaid provision, saying it is \u201cthe most important long-term reform in the bill. That is why it has been in each draft we have released.\u201dThe GOP bill would make significant cuts to Medicaid and change the way it is funded, a move that concerns Republican centrists but is important to conservatives like Mr. Johnson.For the bill to pass, Mr. McConnell can\u2019t afford more than two defections among the 52 Republican senators; no Democrats are expected to support the measure, and Vice President       Mike Pence       would break a potential 50-50 tie. Sens.       Susan Collins       of Maine and       Rand Paul       of Kentucky, both Republicans, have already said they are opposed to the bill.On the Senate floor Monday, Mr. McConnell argued that the current version of the legislation would be vastly superior to the alternatives that would emerge if the bill stalls.\u201cThese are the kind of reforms Americans deserve,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cNot the status quo of Obamacare, not a multibillion-dollar Band-Aid, not a piling-on of even more Obamacare\u2014but real, patient-centered reforms that can finally move us beyond the pain of Obamacare.\u201dSen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber\u2019s Democratic leader, urged Republicans to take advantage of the delay to hold hearings on the bill.\u201cMy Republican friends propose to pass legislation that would reorganize one sixth of our economy and touch the lives of every American, without a single hearing,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that amazing? Not one hearing.\u201dThe downfall of the bill would be a tough blow for President       Donald Trump,        who has made it clear that undoing the 2010 law is a priority and has leaned heavily on fellow Republicans to make it happen. Mr. Trump said recently he would be very angry if the repeal legislation didn\u2019t make it to his desk, and he was meeting Monday night with a handful of Republican Senators to discuss the legislation.Earlier Monday, the president promised Republicans would replace the law with \u201csomething that is going to be outstanding\u201d and \u201cfar, far better than failing Obamacare.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to get that done,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think we\u2019re going to surprise a lot of people.\u201dMr. Trump also referred to the importance of Mr. McCain\u2019s return. \u201cWe miss him,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s a crusty voice in Washington. Plus, we need that vote.\u201dBut it remained uncertain Monday how long Mr. McCain would be convalescing. Last week, surgeons removed a five-centimeter clot during a minimally invasive craniotomy\u2014an opening into the skull\u2014with an eyebrow incision, according to Mr. McCain\u2019s office. Pathology reports are pending this week, and Mr. McCain is recovering in Arizona on the advice of his doctors, aides said.Stephan A. Mayer, chairman of neurology at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, said that from the description of Mr. McCain\u2019s case so far, \u201cit\u2019s almost certainly a subdural hematoma.\u201d That condition, a clot inside the skull but outside the brain itself, often will appear in conjunction with symptoms like \u201cslurred speech, or a gait problem,\u201d Dr. Mayer said.Dr. Mayer said \u201cit would be remarkable if he were back in a week, but maybe two weeks would be possible.\u201dEven before Mr. McCain\u2019s absence, GOP leaders were having trouble nailing down the votes for the procedural motion necessary to proceed to debating the health bill and considering amendments.\u201cIf we don\u2019t take up the bill, well, it can\u2019t be changed, and millions of Americans will continue to be harmed by the status quo,\u201d Sen.       John Cornyn       of Texas, the chamber\u2019s second-ranking Republican, said on the floor Monday. \u201cDo we have enough confidence that we can make it better, or are we simply going to throw our hands up and say, \u2018Well, I give up before we even start\u2019?\u201dRepublican leaders say they haven\u2019t given up, but fault lines have already emerged in both the House and the Senate over the way forward in the event of the bill\u2019s collapse.Conservatives are making it clear that they will redouble their push for a straightforward repeal of the 2010 law with an expiration date a year or two later, giving lawmakers time to craft a replacement.

Nine people suffered minor injuries, including smoke inhalation, in the incident.The misery continued through the day.NJ Transit canceled a half dozen trains, mostly during the afternoon and evening, because of staffing problems. A source with knowledge of the situation said drivers were exercising a contractual right not to show up for work in the immediate aftermath of a schedule change.A spokeswoman for NJ Transit said: \u201cWe would hope they would come to work because this is not helping the public.\u201d Jim Brown, the general chairman of the drivers union, the NJ Transit Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, declined to comment.The subways suffered further problems too. In the late afternoon and early evening, there were disruptions on the A, C, E, F, G, M, N, Q, R, W, 2, 3, 4, and 5 trains. The delays were caused by signal and mechanical problems as well as a track fire at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street. No one was injured in that fire.This summer\u2019s service reductions into Penn Station have placed increased strain on a transportation system that in many areas is already operating at capacity. New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       warned in the months leading up to the reductions that commuters faced a \u201csummer of hell.\u201dFollowing the morning\u2019s track fire incident, riders on one train recounted filing through the cars to exit through a single door that had been pulled into the 155th Street station.\u201cIt was horrible,\u201d said       Martha Canto,        a travel consultant who lives in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Heights. She walked to the 1 train, which she called a nightmare because of packed conditions. Many commuters were forced to allow multiple trains to pass before they could squeeze onto a car.\u201cI\u2019m totally late, and I started out early,\u201c said Ms. Canto, 54 years old. \u201cOnce one train goes out of commission, it\u2019s a domino effect and creates a lot of problems, especially for millions trying to get to work during rush hour.\u201dAs of\u00a08:30 a.m., the Metropolitan Transportation Authority reported no service in both directions on A trains between 125th Street and Inwood-207th Street, on C trains between 168th Street and Euclid Avenue, on B trains between 125th Street and Bedford Park Boulevard, and on D trains between 125th Street and 205th Street.A Fire Department of New York official said firefighters put out the fire at 9:15 a.m.Justine DiCostanzo, who owns a Pilates studio, said her train stopped between stations, and eventually was evacuated into the 168th Street station.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because there was another issue with the A train not that long ago,\u201c said Ms. DiCostanzo, 52, who also lives in Washington Heights. \u201cWe had to go single file through the train to get to one door.\u201dStill, she said the MTA employees and her fellow straphangers had taken the delays, and resulting packed trains, in stride. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been really nice,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat can you do?\u201dAmtrak closed several tracks at Penn Station this summer to carry out extensive repairs following three derailments earlier this year.NJ Transit riders, meanwhile, had to choose between catching one of the few Gladstone Branch trains that were still operating or take the bus.As one of those buses entered the Lincoln Tunnel at about\u00a09:15 a.m.,       Vince Beatty,        of South Orange, said: \u201cI hate the bus.

This changed due to legislation that overhauled aspects of how law enforcement conducts eyewitness identification in New York, including by permitting photo arrays at trials and, by next April, mandating videotaped interrogations for those accused of certain serious crimes.Proponents say these changes will help convict the guilty and prevent wrongful convictions of innocent people. Critics say some of the changes, including guidance for how officers conduct arrays, don\u2019t go far enough.The legislation is a \u201csea change\u201d for criminal justice in New York, which was the only state in the nation that didn\u2019t allow photo arrays to be used at trial, said       Alphonso David,        counsel to Gov.       Andrew Cuomo,        a Democrat.Backing the changes are uncommon allies: The Innocence Project, which seeks to exonerate the wrongly convicted, and the District Attorneys Association of the State of New York, which represents prosecutors in the state.\u201cIn the courtroom, it created issues with the jury,\u201d said       Scott McNamara,        the association\u2019s president, who also serves as Oneida County district attorney, of the ban on photo arrays.Because prosecutors couldn\u2019t present the arrays, the jurors missed a crucial chunk of the investigation, he said. When a prosecutor asked if the person who committed the crime was in the room, the witness would point to the defense table, which seemed suspect to a jury, Mr. McNamara said.\u201cThe jury would wonder, how did the police get from \u2018The bank was robbed\u2019 to here?\u201d he said.Seventy-one percent of wrongful convictions exonerated through DNA evidence in the U.S. have involved eyewitness misidentification, according to the Innocence Project.Allowing photo arrays will have a larger impact on upstate counties and rural areas that rarely use lineups, prosecutors say. The New York Police Department prefers to conduct lineups, but uses photo arrays in circumstances where a lineup isn\u2019t feasible, a spokeswoman said. For example, a witness might be in the hospital and can\u2019t come to the precinct to view a lineup.Lineups, which use real people who resemble suspects, have always been permitted.Research has shown the reliability of an array or lineup depends on the procedures used to administer it, said J.C. Lore, director of trial advocacy at Rutgers Law School. However, it is easier to put together a good array than a good lineup because of the ease and speed of assembling similar photos as opposed to similar people, he added.The changes include a requirement to videotape the questioning of a suspect accused of serious crimes like some homicides and sexual assaults. To introduce photo arrays in court, the officers who conducted the array must either not know where the suspect is in the array or not know who the suspect is.Some defense attorneys criticized the changes, saying allowing arrays in court would create a disincentive to conduct lineups, which are considerably more labor intensive. Furthermore, the measures meant to improve identification procedures don\u2019t go far enough, they said.\u201cThe real problem with this photo-identification law is how much of it is optional,\u201d said       Al O\u2019Connor,        litigation counsel at the New York State Defenders Association.Mr. O\u2019Connor also noted interrogations for many crimes, such as armed robbery, aren\u2019t required to be videotaped. \u201cIf we\u2019re really going to move forward and rely primarily on photographic identifications, the police agencies must step up and memorialize these with video and audio taping,\u201d he said.Peter Mitchell,        an attorney at the Legal Aid Society, said the legislation doesn\u2019t completely eliminate post-identification reinforcement, or officers giving subtle approval to the witness, which could then give them more confidence when testifying in court.Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'New Law Widens Type of Evidence Allowed.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 20:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-law-allows-identification-of-suspects-by-photo-as-evidence-1500338152", "news_title": "New Law Allows Identification of Suspects by Photo as Evidence ", "keywords": "evidence in criminal trials,eyewitness identification,photo arrays,police procedures,suspect identification,suspect lineup,videotaped interrogations,political,general news,crime,legal action"}, {"content": "Moscow turned up the rhetorical heat against the U.S. on Monday as high-ranking U.S. and Russian officials met in Washington amid a continuing dispute over American allegations that the Kremlin interfered with the 2016 presidential election.The Obama administration, in response to Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the election, late last year expelled 35 Russians it said were intelligence operatives serving under diplomatic cover.

It added 5.2 million users in total, far more than the 3.2 million it had projected, as well as Wall Street\u2019s estimate of 3.5 million net additions.Revenue jumped 32% to $2.79 billion, while the company\u2019s operating profit margin globally was 4.6%, down from 9.7% in the first quarter.Netflix has indicated to Wall Street it would like to be judged primarily based on its revenue and global operating-profit margins, as opposed to metrics such as its subscriber additions. But many investors have remained focused on subscriber growth as a proxy for long-term financial health.Netflix shares have risen 30% this year and were up 10% in aftermarket trading on Monday.The latest results underscored just how unpredictable Netflix\u2019s quarterly reports are becoming. The company is still trying to understand the precise mix of factors that propel fantastic results and those that bring about disappointing ones. One question for Wall Street will be whether the surge in the second quarter was related to specific show releases, or was a sign of underlying momentum.In a letter to shareholders, Netflix said it underestimated the popularity of its growing slate of programming, which led to higher-than-expected subscription growth across its major markets. This year, Netflix programs got 91 Emmy Award nominations, up from 54 in 2016, according to Cantor Fitzgerald, including best drama nods for \u201cStranger Things,\u201d \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201dOn a video chat with an analyst, Netflix Chief Executive       Reed Hastings       said the company is reaping the dividends of its big content investments.\u201cWhen we produce an amazing show like \u2018Stranger Things,\u2019 that\u2019s a lot of capital upfront, and then you get a payout over many years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd seeing the positive returns on that for the business as a whole is what makes us comfortable that we should continue to invest.\u201dThe company said it now has $15.7 billion in streaming-content obligations, a measure of current and future costs for content acquisition, licensing and production, up from $13.2 billion in the same quarter last year.Netflix added 4.14 million international subscribers in the quarter, well above its guidance of 2.6 million. It added 1.07 million U.S. subscribers, compared with its target of 600,000.The company said the sequential increase in new subscribers to 5.2 million in the second quarter from 5 million in the first quarter went against historic seasonal trends.Netflix expects to keep up strong momentum in the third quarter, projecting 4.4 million subscriber additions, but warned that it has over-forecast in the past, and that some subscriber growth could have been pulled forward into the second quarter.The strong growth comes as competition is intensifying in the streaming market. In the U.S., Netflix is battling for wallet-share against rivals         Amazon.com Inc.       and Hulu, as well as \u201cskinny\u201d bundles like Sling TV and YouTube TV that hope to be substitutes for cable. Internationally, Netflix has to contend with dozens of local rivals. Netflix also competes against the biggest TV channels and studios for original programming.Netflix posted a second- quarter profit of $66 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with a profit of $41 million, or 9 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had projected earnings of 16 cents a share on $2.76 billion in revenue.As with many tech giants in recent years, investors are more concerned with Netflix\u2019s growth potential than its current earnings. Shares are priced at more than 200 times earnings.The streaming-video company said that a majority of its subscribers are now international, and that it expects the international unit to post its first-ever annual profit this year. International customers accounted for under a quarter of the total in 2013.Netflix has been aggressively pursuing global expansion as its core U.S. market matures and as it works to offset growing content costs and original programming investments.Following a battery of launches last year, Netflix said it serves customers in more than 190 countries. The one big market where the service isn\u2019t available is China. Netflix has acknowledged that gaining a foothold there has been difficult.In April, Netflix said it reached a licensing deal with         Baidu Inc.\u2019s       Chinese video-streaming platform iQiyi to show its original content in China.Improving profitability in the company\u2019s more established international markets is letting Netflix invest more in newer areas.

Summer is nearly half over, and on Monday the Department of Homeland Security finally agreed to issue 15,000 additional H-2B visas.The H-2B visa program covers a myriad of industries that rely on seasonal labor including seafood, construction, skiing, tourism and landscaping. These jobs typically pay well, though they can be grueling and their temporary nature deters native-born Americans from applying. Some summer jobs in tourism used to be filled by teens who now spend their summers studying or volunteering.Foreign workers have become even more crucial as labor markets have tightened amid near record low unemployment in many states. Unemployment is a mere 2.3% in Colorado, 2.7% in Hawaii and 3.2% in Maine. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 755,000 job openings in food services and accommodations in May, up 12% from a year ago.H-2B visas are capped annually at 66,000, and the labor shortage was exacerbated after Congress last year refused to extend a provision in the law that allowed foreigners who had previously worked on H-2Bs to count toward the limit. But the omnibus budget that Congress passed in May let Homeland Security Secretary       John Kelly       increase the number of visas in consultation with Labor Secretary       Alexander Acosta.While the 15,000 additional visas will no doubt be welcomed by employers, they won\u2019t satisfy the growing demand for labor. More than 120,000 seasonal visas were requested this year, so tens of thousands of summer positions in hotels, fisheries and elsewhere will go unfilled. Businesses in disparate industries will be competing for too few foreign workers. And because the government usually requires between 30 to 60 days to process visas, workers may not arrive in time to benefit some employers. The result will be reduced economic output and perhaps shorter vacations for U.S. workers.The decision to grant the new visas is a de facto admission that the U.S. has a labor shortage.

The champion of Brazil\u2019s left who served two terms as president from 2003-2011 was convicted for money laundering and corruption and sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison. Judge       Sergio Moro       ruled that Lula had steered government contracts to the Brazilian construction firm OAS in exchange for roughly $1.2 million in bribes in the form of a refurbished beach-front apartment.Lula\u2019s Workers Party allies are howling that he was framed by his political enemies, but everything about the decision suggests the opposite. Mr. Moro\u2019s prosecutors have spent three years in a painstaking investigation that has uncovered a vast network of government graft emanating from the giant government-owned oil company             Petrobras,       whose contracts were steered by Lula.Scores of Brazilian businessmen and politicians have been caught in the net. And it is Mr. Moro\u2019s willingness to follow the case where it led, including to a popular former head of state, that breaks new ground for the young democracy. \u201cIt\u2019s lamentable that a president of the republic is criminally convicted,\u201d Mr. Moro said. \u201cNo matter how important you are, no one is above the law.\u201d Investors voted on the Lula verdict by bidding up stocks and Brazil\u2019s currency on the news.This is real progress for South America\u2019s largest economy and a cause for optimism despite the immediate turmoil. The great flaw most developing countries share is a weak rule of law. Brazil has spent lavishly trying to become an industrial giant by subsidizing and sheltering from competition large state-owned enterprises like Petrobras.

Mr. Oliver was fired by the Balch Springs Police Department following the shooting.\u201cThis is the very first time we have issued an arrest warrant for a police officer before the case was presented to a grand jury,\u201d Dallas County District Attorney       Faith Johnson       said in a statement.In addition to the murder charge, Mr. Oliver was indicted on four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public servant in the shooting, charges related to the four other passengers in the car.Both the murder charge, and the assault charges, each carry a penalty of up to life in prison.At a news conference\u00a0Monday, Ms. Johnson said the case had moved quickly because\u00a0authorities decided to\u00a0charge Mr. Oliver before seeking an indictment.\u201cWe wanted to be able to have healing for this family, and to let this family know that we are going to move as quickly as possible,\u201d she said.Friends, family, and school officials, described Jordan,\u00a0a freshman\u00a0who played on the football team at\u00a0Mesquite High School, as well-liked and a good student.In June, Mr. Oliver was also indicted for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in an unrelated case for brandishing a gun while off duty after a minor car accident.It is rare for police officers to face charges for on-duty shootings\u2014though the number has risen in recent years\u2014and it is especially difficult to win a conviction in such cases, experts say.In recent months, several officers have been acquitted in high-profile shootings involving minorities. In June, a Minnesota police officer was acquitted of manslaughter in the shooting death of a black motorist,       Philando Castile,        during a traffic stop. Mr. Castile told the officer just prior to be being shot that he had a firearm, which he was legally permitted to carry. The officer,\u00a0Jeronimo Yanez, said he was in fear of his life.The case drew an outcry after Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend streamed the aftermath of the shooting and posted it to             Facebook.Write to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'Ex-Officer Indicted in Death of Black Teen.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 19:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-texas-police-officer-indicted-for-murder-in-april-shooting-of-black-teenager-1500328566", "news_title": "Former Texas Police Officer Indicted for Murder in April Shooting of Black Teenager ", "keywords": "balch springs, balch springs police shooting, balch springs shooting, dallas county da, dallas da faith johnson, jordan edwards, police shootings, roy oliver,roy oliver indicted,Balch Springs Police Department,Philando Castile,Roy Oliver,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,law enforcement,murder,manslaughter"}, {"content": "The Trump administration\u00a0on Monday\u00a0published its long-awaited negotiating objectives for a planned overhaul of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. The objectives, required for a rewrite of the law, allow U.S. officials to begin formal talks with Canada and Mexico in as little as 30 days. The move also opens up what\u2019s expected to be a spirited debate in Congress, where majority votes would be needed in the House and Senate to pass any new deal. Here are some major takeaways:TPP By Another NameThe Nafta objectives include a number of items already negotiated under the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which       President Trump       killed on his first full workday in the Oval Office. They include rules covering state-owned enterprises, e-commerce and financial services. These should be easy parts to negotiate, since all three nations already agreed to such measures under TPP.Environment and LaborThe administration says it wants to make environmental and labor disputes subject to Nafta arbitration panels\u2014meaning that alleged violations can be punished by the imposition of tariffs.\u00a0They would replace weak labor and environmental panels that were added to Nafta after the main accord was negotiated as a way to win congressional support for the trade pact. Businesses in all three countries are likely to object.CurrencyThe administration wants to make Nafta the first U.S. trade pact to police \u201ccurrency manipulation.\u201d That would be a big deal\u2014and one that may be easy to reach, because neither Canada nor Mexico face such accusations, which are usually leveled at Asian trading partners. The goal would be to establish this as precedent for future trade pacts.Tougher EnforcementOne area where the plan does embrace the trade warrior agenda is a proposal to scrap a special Nafta provision that has made it easier for Canada and Mexico to avert U.S. trade sanctions, the so-called \u201cChapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism\u201d that allows Nafta partners to challenge duties before a special Nafta tribunal available only to them.\u00a0Canada in particular has made keeping Chapter 19 a priority. Chad Bown\u00a0of the Peterson Institute for International Economics says the Trump administration\u2019s general focus on tougher enforcement will likely push Canada to dig in on keeping Chapter 19, making this one likely flashpoint of the talks.Investor ProtectionThere is no provision of Nafta\u2014or other trade deals\u2014that irks critics more than the ability of investors to sue governments in arbitration panels over policies they deem antibusiness. A loss of sovereignty, the critics say. A necessary alternative to corrupt legal systems, counters business. The U.S. seeks a middle-ground that may not exist: The U.S. wouldn\u2019t eliminate the panels, but would constrain their power in the U.S.Who\u2019s Nafta For?The document does acknowledge some winners from Nafta\u2014notably \u201cfarmers and ranchers\u201d who got \u201cmuch needed market access\u201d from the pact. That\u2019s a nod to the (heavily Republican) farm-state lawmakers who have made clear to Mr. Trump he\u2019d better not mess with their success. It largely portrays the pact as a raw deal for \u201cAmerican workers,\u201d slammed by factories lost due to outsourcing. The broad goal is to help companies \u201cgrow their exports.\u201d Left unmentioned: American consumers, who, economists say, have gained tremendously from the pact through cheaper prices and greater variety.Which Trump Faction Won?All Trump trade pronouncements are scrutinized for which faction of his advisers won: the economic nationalists who shaped his campaign platform, or the globalists who run his economic team. The quick Kremlinology says it\u2019s the globalists, led by       Gary Cohn,        the former             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       president running the White House National Economic Council. That said, the battle isn\u2019t over. Many of the provisions remain vague. And Mr. Trump has reserved the right to pull out altogether\u2014the goal of his nationalist advisers\u2014if he\u2019s not pleased with the final result.Write to Bob Davis at bob.davis@wsj.com and Jacob M.

To do so, it must use up a big chunk of the $1.1 billion in cash sitting on its balance sheet. Ensco bondholders worry that if oil prices and spending on drilling for oil offshore remain depressed in the next two years, the cash drain from the Atwood purchase could force Ensco to face a cash crunch down the road, according to the person familiar and a bondholder.Atwood generates no free cash flow, though it does have $450 million in cash on its balance sheet, which Ensco will use toward the debt repayment.Adding to bondholder worries is that Ensco has $5.3 billion in debt of its own. Moreover, both Ensco and Atwood are expected to burn cash this year, according to a report from AllianceBernstein and the person familiar with the matter.Over the past year, many offshore oil drilling companies with high debt loads have filed for bankruptcy or restructured debt out of court as demand and rates paid by oil producers to hire out the rigs have crashed. Among these are             Ocean Rig UDW Inc.,Paragon Offshore               PLC and             Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc.Ensco touts its $2.25 billion in undrawn revolver capacity as a cushion that will help it ride out the oil downturn, especially since the company has little in the way of debt maturities until 2020; it has $1.55 billion in debt maturing in 2020.\u201cThe deal significantly elevates risk but does not trigger any imminent liquidity crisis,\u201d wrote Colin Davies, oil field services equity analyst at AllianceBernstein in a July 13 report.The biggest argument in favor of the deal is that it adds a number of high-quality oil drilling rigs to Ensco\u2019s fleet. The question, however, is whether this is the right time for Ensco to make such a purchase since oil prices and offshore drilling activity could remain weak for years, noted the person familiar and the bondholder.The deal requires the approval of Ensco and Atwood shareholders, but bondholders have few avenues to pursue to block the deal, noted the person familiar and the bondholder. Some of the same concerns will likely weigh on shareholders\u2019 minds, but they are likely to approve the deal, according to the AllianceBernstein report.Ensco forecasts it will be able to cut $65 million in costs annually as a result of the deal, starting in 2019.Both Ensco\u2019s and Atwood\u2019s shares have declined since they announced the merger on May 31, with Ensco shares off close to $1 per share, closing at $5.25 Monday, and Atwood\u2019s shares down almost $2, closing Monday at $8.07.Meanwhile one tranche of Ensco\u2019s bonds due in 2027 had dropped to 89.375 as of July 10, from 94.875 on May 15, according to MarketAxess. Atwood\u2019s bonds have also traded down, though they remain close to par. The company\u2019s notes due 2020 were at 97.25 Monday, down from 100.7 on May 31, according to MarketAxess.An Ensco spokesman declined to comment, while Atwood couldn't immediately be reached.Write to Soma Biswas at soma.biswas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 18:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ensco-bondholders-unhappy-with-atwood-oceanics-deal-1500331717", "news_title": "Ensco Bondholders Unhappy With Atwood Oceanics Deal ", "keywords": "balance sheet,bondholders,debt,liquidity,Atwood Oceanics,ATW,ENSCO,ESV,bankruptcy,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,support activities for oil,gas,natural gas,oil extraction"}, {"content": "KKR & Co.        KKR 1.62%       put two executives in line Monday to take over one day for       Henry Kravis       and       George Roberts,        the private-equity pioneers atop one of the biggest brands in finance.The New York asset manager elevated       Joe Bae       and Scott Nuttall to the roles of co-president and co-chief operating officer and added them to its board, according to a statement Monday. In their new roles, they will run KKR\u2019s day-to-day operations.The appointments solidify the men\u2019s candidacies to one day run KKR. There\u2019s no guarantee that either or both the men will end up atop the firm.KKR, founded in 1976, helped popularize debt-fueled corporate takeovers known as leveraged buyouts. It earned a place in Wall Street lore with deals such as the 1988 purchase of             RJR Nabisco,        RAI 1.14%       chronicled in the book \u201cBarbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco.\u201dBut like its rivals, KKR has faced nagging questions over its ability to endure a generational change. The top private-equity firms rely on the track records, influence and mystique of their founders to raise money and land deals, and many of the industry\u2019s leaders have been reluctant to hand over the reins.KKR has expanded dramatically in recent decades, though it has lagged behind some rivals such as Blackstone Group LP and Apollo Global Management LLC since the financial crisis in a race to accumulate fee-generating assets. While KKR\u2019s stock has roughly doubled since the company listed its shares in 2010, it has lagged behind Blackstone\u2019s and the S&P 500.Mr. Bae, a 45-year-old Korean-American deal maker, is well-known in private-equity circles. A Harvard grad and             Goldman Sachs                   alum, he built an Asian investing operation that proved a bright spot for KKR as the firm struggled with souring U.S. buyouts struck in the run-up to the financial crisis. Its wins included the $1.8 billion buyout and subsequent sale of Oriental Brewery to             Anheuser-Busch InBev                   NV in 2014, earning the firm five times its investment, according to a person familiar with the matter. KKR last month closed a $9.3 billion fund dedicated to buyouts in the Asia-Pacific region, the largest such investment product focused on the area.Mr. Nuttall, 44, helps manage some of the activity KKR sees as key to differentiating itself from an increasingly crowded field. More than its peers, the firm has expanded into the lucrative business of advising companies on raising debt and equity capital, and put its own money into deals, a twist on the private-equity model KKR\u2019s founders had a hand in creating.A soft-spoken executive who previously worked at Blackstone after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Nuttall joined KKR as a private-equity investor. As time passed, his focus shifted to building the firm\u2019s own business, helping it create in-house debt-trading and hedge-fund units as KKR sought to diversify beyond its private-equity roots.He rose through the ranks while taking part in challenging deals such as KKR\u2019s 2007 buyout of             First Data.       KKR has struggled to unload its investment in the payment processor, whose business had stumbled after it was saddled with debt that at one point totaled more than $20 billion. Mr. Nuttall routinely speaks for the firm on quarterly earnings conference calls and investor events.In their new roles, Mr. Bae will lead KKR\u2019s efforts in private-equity, infrastructure, real estate and energy investments, while Mr. Nuttall will primarily oversee its businesses in corporate debt, hedge funds and capital markets, and manage the firm\u2019s own corporate development. Both men joined the firm in 1996, and in recent years have been perceived as among the potential front-runners to one day lead it.Meanwhile,       Alexander Navab,        head of KKR\u2019s private-equity business in the Americas, plans to depart the firm, according the company\u2019s statement, which didn\u2019t provide further details.Succession at KKR has been a subject of mounting interest inside and outside the firm as its founders age. In recent years, Messrs. Kravis and Roberts, 73-year-old cousins, had largely dismissed questions about when they\u2019ll retire. They and some of their peers have played active roles as their firms have grown from modest investment partnerships to major asset managers. Many of the largest such firms are still run by the men who started them.Messrs. Kravis and Roberts will retain their roles as co-chief executives and co-chairmen at KKR.The pair formed KKR with Jerome Kohlberg, their colleague in the corporate-finance division of Bear Stearns. In the following decades, the company\u2019s fortunes traced the rise of private equity and other so-called alternative investments, growing to manage $138 billion as of March 31.Private-equity firms\u2019 growth has made the companies major players on Wall Street and in the mainstream economy. The portfolio companies of KKR\u2019s private-equity unit alone employed 995,000 people at year-end, according to the firm\u2019s website.\u00a0Along the way, KKR and Blackstone morphed into public companies themselves, as did Apollo and             Carlyle Group                   LP.The industry\u2019s success also has bred competition. Blackstone, the largest so-called alternative asset manager, has outpaced KKR in building large businesses in real estate, corporate debt and hedge funds. It had $368 billion in assets under management as of March 31.KKR and its rivals also face competition from scores of newer entrants, some of which seek an edge by specializing in a particular industry or region.Private-equity firms have amassed growing sums of capital to invest from pensions, sovereign-wealth funds and other major investors seeking better returns. The firms have sometimes struggled to put all the cash to work, a task made more difficult as valuations in the stock market and elsewhere rise.The industry\u2019s assets under management increased to a record $2.49 trillion last year, and private-equity managers recently sat on a record $820 billion in unspent capital, known as \u201cdry powder.\u201dWhat also sets KKR apart from its rivals is the dozens of capital-markets executives the company has hired to arrange debt and equity financing for companies\u2014both those that it owns as well as third parties. The group competes for fees with the investment banks that also serve the firm, prompting occasional grumbling from Wall Street bankers.But KKR executives argue the division gives the firm\u2019s bottom line a boost and helps it keep a finger on the pulse of the market. KKR\u2019s capital-markets revenue rose to $121 million in the first quarter, far exceeding the unit\u2019s previous quarterly high of $87.5 million.The firm also uses its $13 billion balance sheet, the biggest among its peers, to seed new businesses and strike unusually structured deals that might otherwise be difficult for a private-equity firm to complete. This year, for example, it used its own money to team up with Canadian pension Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec for a roughly $2 billion purchase of insurance broker USI Insurance Services.Write to Matt Jarzemsky at matthew.jarzemsky@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'Changing of Guard at KKR Takes Shape.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 18:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kkr-promotes-bae-nuttall-to-co-president-co-coo-1500297687", "news_title": "A New Generation Is Poised to Take Control of KKR", "keywords": " blackstone,executives,kkr, private equity firm,succession,KKR &,KKR,Reynolds American,RAI,Alexander Navab,Henry Kravis,George Roberts,Joe Bae,Jerome Kohlberg,Scott Nuttall,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,management,management moves,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,leveraged buyouts,senior level management,food,beverages,tobacco,tobacco products,cigarettes,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,financial investments,alternative investments,banking,credit,consumer goods,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Call it cookies and cream, New York-style.To mark the opening\u00a0on Monday\u00a0of its location on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, Quality Eats steakhouse has created a rugelach ice cream in partnership with Orwashers, a bakery that has been a fixture in the neighborhood since 1916.The idea, say representatives from both businesses, is to play off the popularity of the cookies-and-cream flavor, but with a kind of Big Apple bravado.

Those losses would have been \u201cminimized or avoided\u201d if plan administrators had stopped offering Sears shares as an investment option sooner, according to the complaint.The 401(k) plan froze purchases of Sears shares at the end of 2016, \u201ctoo little, too late, to protect a great deal of [the] participants\u2019 retirement savings,\u201d the complaint said.Sears stock lost 80% of its value in the three years before the lawsuit.A Sears spokesman declined to comment.\u201cThis case is about the defendants\u2019 abject failure, as plan fiduciaries, to protect the interests of the participants,\u201d the complaint said.Sears shares have eroded since 2014 as retail foot traffic and revenue nationwide migrated away from department stores and shopping malls and onto web platforms like             Amazon.com Inc.       A series of loans from Mr. Lampert have kept Sears afloat while it closes stores in an attempt to shrink down to a profitable operation. A securities filing on Monday revealed that Mr. Lampert agreed to provide another $200 million in credit, the latest infusion of liquidity from his hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc.Sears shares closed at $9.04 on Monday, up 12.16% on the news.The suit, brought on behalf of plan participant Robert A. Catalfamo, said the 401(k) plan administrators turned a blind eye to those industrywide pressures. The defined-contribution retirement plan held $31.6 million worth of Sears stock at the end of 2015, the most recent data available, and $47.8 million worth a year earlier, according to the complaint.The U.S. Supreme Court in 2015 put companies managing 401(k) plans on notice that they have a continuing duty to be judicious on plan investment decisions. That ruling, which held that plan administrators must continue \u201cto monitor trust investments and remove imprudent ones,\u201d involved a 401(k) offering that allegedly wasted participants\u2019 money on retail mutual funds when less-expensive options were available.Since 2011, Sears posted a net shareholder loss of nearly $10 billion, a number that would have been larger without the one-time proceeds from this year\u2019s sale of its Craftsman brand. The 401(k) plan held an estimated 1.5 million shares of Sears stock from 2014 to 2015, according to the complaint. Overall, it lost $4.5 million in 2014 and $12.9 million in 2015.Sears and the plan\u2019s investment committee \u201cchose to, as fiduciaries, continue allowing the plan to acquire further Sears stock, while taking no action to protect their wards as Sears\u2019s condition worsened,\u201d the complaint said.Class-action suits on behalf of 401(k) participants have been prevalent in recent years under federal retirement law. Other litigation campaigns have challenged companies\u2019 reliance on higher-fee options and financial firms\u2019 use of their own products as investment options.The lawsuit seeks a judgment compelling Sears \u201cto make good to the plan\u201d all losses on Sears stock for the past three years, the window for collecting such damages under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 18:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sears-hit-with-401-k-plan-lawsuit-1500329742", "news_title": "Sears Hit With 401(k) Plan Lawsuit", "keywords": "401k,capital infusion,class action,retail,sears holding savings plan,Sears Holdings,SHLD,corporate crime,legal action,bankruptcy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,settlements,political,general news,personal finance,retirement planning,wholesale,mixed retailing"}, {"content": "Stephen K. Bannon, President       Donald Trump\u2019s       chief strategist, grew up in a working-class suburb of Richmond, Va. He attended Benedictine College Preparatory, a Catholic military school, where he and his peers viewed rivals from wealthier prep schools with disdain. \u201cWe were the blue-collar guys,\u201d recalls a school friend of Mr. Bannon in Joshua Green\u2019s \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain.\u201d \u201cThey were the rich snobs. They\u2019d always do the employer-employee joke at us: \u2018When you grow up, you\u2019ll work for us.\u2019 And we\u2019d punch \u2019em in the nose.\u201dMr. Green\u2019s book chronicles the life and career of Mr. Bannon, especially his unlikely friendship with the seemingly un-blue-collar Mr. Trump and their even unlikelier victory in last year\u2019s election, and returns again and again to this us-versus-the-establishment theme, only rarely pushing the trope too hard. Mr. Bannon is among the most disliked figures in American politics, hated by many on the right and both hated and feared by almost everyone on the left. But a reader of \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain\u201d who knew nothing about American politics and didn\u2019t catch Mr. Green\u2019s subtle but thoroughly unsympathetic judgments of his subject might come away thinking Mr. Bannon was the book\u2019s hero: Everyone roots for an irreverent upstart who outrages a self-satisfied establishment and turns the system upside down.Mr. Bannon was introduced to Mr. Trump in 2012, soon after       Mitt Romney\u2019s       loss to       Barack Obama.       At that time, he had just taken over Andrew Breitbart\u2019s abrasively right-wing news website, following its founder\u2019s death, and was searching for a political candidate who had no regard for the conventions of American politics and would mount an unapologetic defense of American values against both a hegemonic left and conciliatory right. He had previously championed the presidential aims of Michele Bachmann, a Tea Party favorite, and made a cloyingly laudatory film, \u201cThe Undefeated,\u201d about       Sarah Palin.       Mr. Bannon\u2019s cultural conservatism\u2014rooted, Mr. Green suggests, in the deeply traditionalist Catholicism in which he was raised\u2014didn\u2019t seem like a perfect fit for a libertine real-estate mogul and reality TV star. (Mr. Trump, moreover, is notoriously averse to slovenly attire, and Mr. Bannon often gives the appearance of having just awakened from a night on a park bench.)Yet the two connected. Mr. Trump liked Mr. Bannon\u2019s boldness, intelligence and contempt for ruling classes of all kinds. Mr. Bannon provided the aspiring president, Mr. Green contends, with two things he didn\u2019t already have: first, \u201ca fully formed, internally coherent worldview that accommodated Trump\u2019s own feelings about trade and foreign threats, what Trump eventually dubbed \u2018America first\u2019 nationalism\u201d; and, second, \u201can infrastructure of conservative organizations\u201d\u2014especially Breitbart News.By Joshua Green  Penguin Press, 272 pages, $27I suspect Mr. Trump was also impressed by Mr. Bannon\u2019s career and accomplishments, engagingly recorded in \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain.\u201d After graduating from Virginia Tech, Mr. Bannon entered the Navy, serving on the destroyer Paul F. Foster when it was sent to the Persian Gulf in 1980 as part of the Carter administration\u2019s disastrously failed attempt to extract American hostages held in Iran. It was there, as Mr. Bannon explains to the author (he was interviewed extensively for the book), that his political outlook began to form. That a band of terrorists could humiliate the United States, thanks largely to a weak and risk-averse president, enraged him.He entered Harvard Business School in 1983, worked for a time at             Goldman Sachs,       then started his own company, Bannon & Co., which dealt mainly with media acquisitions. His Hollywood firm bought a stake in several\u200bsit-coms, including the theretofore unheralded \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d Later he joined Jeff Kwatinetz\u2019s talent agency, The Firm, and made headlines by acquiring former Disney president Michael Ovitz\u2019s ailing Artist\u200bManagement Group for a tiny fraction of what almost everyone thought it was worth. In 2005 Mr. Bannon went to Hong Kong and invested in a series of internet gaming companies. This, Mr. Green writes, \u201cintroduced him to a hidden world\u201d of frustrated but driven and competent young men and \u201cprovided a kind of conceptual framework that he would later draw on to build up the audience for Breitbart News.\u201d It also helped him recognize the potential for social media to amplify messages that simmer below the surface.For a year or more, Mr. Bannon has been portrayed in sharply unkind ways in the American news media\u2014a bigot, a boor, a nutcase. But although Mr. Green is no admirer of Mr. Bannon\u2019s politics, readers of \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain\u201d will not conclude that the subject is either unsophisticated or politically incompetent. Whether in the end this unapologetic nationalist will get what he wants out of the title\u2019s bargain\u2014a durable populist revolution that subverts and weakens the cultural progressivism that dominates America\u2019s media, education system and entertainment industry\u2014remains as uncertain as ever. The rebellion\u2019s leader doesn\u2019t share Mr. Bannon\u2019s worldview in more than a superficial way and lacks his sustained commitment. But if I were a progressive, I wouldn\u2019t get too complacent about it.Mr. Green is a talented reporter and a gifted storyteller. The anecdotes he records from the chaotic 2016 Trump campaign are both well chosen (they\u2019re there for thematic reasons, not as gratuitous gossip) and brilliantly told. Here, to take one of the best, we learn the origins of Mr. Trump\u2019s idea for a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico. According to former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg, he and consultant Roger Stone came up with the concept as a mnemonic device to help the candidate remember to talk about immigration. It worked. At the Iowa Freedom Summit in January 2015, he tried it. \u201cI will build a wall,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Then he rounded off the point with one of his characteristically short and brash declarations: \u201cNobody builds like Trump.\u201d The crowd went berserk, and the wall was born.Mr. Trump\u2019s despisers will relish these and similar stories in Mr. Green\u2019s book. But they\u2019d better ask themselves, too: Who\u2019s got the bloody nose?Mr. Swaim is the author of \u201cThe Speechwriter: A Brief Education in Politics.\u201dAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-17 18:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-making-of-steve-bannon-1500329396", "news_title": "The Making Of Steve Bannon", "keywords": "Donald Trump,books,political,general news,education,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,domestic politics,school,government bodies,executive branch,reviews"}, {"content": "The Republican push to repeal the Affordable Care Act on Monday momentarily united two New York Democrats who are often at odds.Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       and New York City Mayor       Bill de Blasio       have long sparred with one another, most recently blaming the other for troubles at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and they rarely appear together.But\u00a0they held a joint rally criticizing Republican-backed federal health-insurance bills and supporting New York Attorney General       Eric Schneiderman\u2019s       vow to sue if the GOP gets a new law through Congress.\u201cThis health plan put forward by this Congress will hurt the people of the state of New York, and I\u2019m going to do everything I can to fight against it,\u201d said Mr. Cuomo, calling the mayor \u201ca colleague in this battle.\u201dThe Republican-led House earlier this year passed a bill that would repeal parts of former Democratic President       Barack Obama\u2019s       signature health-insurance law. The Republican-led Senate is currently considering its own version of that bill.Mr. Schneiderman, another Democrat, said\u00a0Monday\u00a0he would sue the federal government if either the House or Senate bills becomes law on \u201cthe basis of several constitutional defects.\u201dHouse Speaker       Paul Ryan,        a Republican from Wisconsin, has defended its bill, saying insurance markets created by Mr. Obama\u2019s law are collapsing and a repeal will help people end their struggles with their health-care plans.Mr. Schneiderman has already sued President       Donald Trump\u2019s       administration over its energy policies and its moratorium on visitors from some Muslim-majority nations because of terrorism concerns. Republican attorneys general did sue the Obama administration, with mixed results.The event\u00a0on Monday, held at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, included remarks from Messrs. Cuomo, de Blasio, and Schneiderman and Democratic Assembly Speaker       Carl Heastie.       The labor unions SEIU 1199 and New York State Nurses Association cheered from the bleachers.Mr. Cuomo, who has been floated as a 2020 presidential candidate, gave a speech touching on national themes. \u201cDisregarding the poor, disregarding the weak, that is not what made this country this country,\u201d he said.He largely trained his fire on Congress and avoided naming Mr. Trump, which is his custom.Mr. Schneiderman, who is considered a possible contender to succeed Mr. Cuomo as governor, gave lower-decibel remarks focused on the rule of law.And Mr. de Blasio, who is aligned with the left wing of his party, adopted the rhetoric of Sens.       Bernie Sanders       and       Elizabeth Warren,        saying \u201cpeople will die\u201d if the Republican proposals lead to a new law.The last time Messrs. Cuomo and de Blasio held a joint event was after a bomb exploded in a Manhattan neighborhood in September 2016.Associates of theirs said they have recently engaged in something of a detente after a yearslong public feud. The two had a private lunch in New York City in May, these people said, and discussed the MTA by phone recently.Politics has united them before. When U.S. Sen.       Ted Cruz       of Texas assailed Mr. Trump, then a candidate, for holding \u201cNew York values\u201d during the 2016 presidential campaign, Messrs.

UnitedHealth said in April that for 2017, it expected adjusted earnings per share of $9.65 to $9.85.REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue of $50.06 billion for the second quarter is projected by analysts, compared with $46.49 billion a year earlier.

UnitedHealth has commented only cautiously about Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a topic that has consumed much of the attention of health-care investors recently. The company, which has largely withdrawn from the ACA\u2019s marketplaces, is likely to get asked about this topic but probably will again avoid saying much.\u2014MEDICAID: Though UnitedHealth is out of the exchanges, it is still a big presence in Medicaid, where over time industry growth could be threatened by cutbacks envisioned in the Republican health bill. In the short term, the company may be asked about growth prospects and the likelihood of states putting a squeeze on their programs.\u2014GOOD NEWS: Analysts are projecting strong growth in Medicare and the company\u2019s health-services arm, Optum. They have noted some contract wins by UnitedHealth\u2019s pharmacy-benefit manager, OptumRx, and they may try to look under the hood to see if the growth might outstrip current projections, since UnitedHealth has a long history of overshooting its own guidance.

The loans were secured by two properties in New York and a condominium in Virginia, real-estate records show.Asked about the subpoena\u00a0Monday, Mr. Calk said he had no comment.A spokesman for Mr. Manafort declined to comment.Mr. Manafort, a Republican political consultant who spent years working for a pro-Russia party in Ukraine, is among the Trump associates at the center of federal and congressional investigations into Russian meddling in last year\u2019s presidential election.Russia has denied meddling in the election, and Mr. Trump and his representatives have said there was no collaboration. Mr. Manafort hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing and has said any suggestion that he coordinated with Russia is unfounded.The Wall Street Journal reported in May that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had begun examining real-estate transactions by Mr. Manafort, who has spent and borrowed tens of millions of dollars in connection with property across the U.S. over the past decade. Investigators at both offices are examining the transactions for indications of money-laundering and fraud, people familiar with the matters have said.The Journal reported that at the time of the loans from Federal Savings Bank, Mr. Manafort was at risk of losing a Brooklyn, N.Y., townhouse and his family\u2019s investments in California properties being developed by his son-in-law, real-estate and court records show.Mr. Calk was a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory panel who overlapped with Mr. Manafort on the Trump campaign. Messrs. Manafort and Calk knew each other before the campaign, a person familiar with the relationship has said.The bank\u2019s loans to Mr. Manafort equaled almost 24% of the bank\u2019s reported $67 million of equity capital, according to a federal report. Around the time they were issued, Mr. Calk had expressed interest in becoming Mr. Trump\u2019s Army Secretary, the Journal previously reported, citing three people briefed on the Army interactions.A veteran whose bank caters to former members of the military, Mr. Calk didn\u2019t get the job, and previously declined to comment on it.Mr. Calk has previously said that the loans to Mr. Manafort were standard with more than sufficient collateral.Mr. Manafort\u2019s Brooklyn townhouse was in foreclosure after a loan against the property, which was used for the son-in-law\u2019s project elsewhere, went into default, a lawyer working with Mr. Manafort has said. Loans for the son-in-law\u2019s California projects also went into default last year, jeopardizing $4.2 million that Mr. Manafort, his wife and daughter had put into those projects, real-estate and bankruptcy court records show.As part of its probe into Mr. Manafort, the New York attorney general\u2019s office in recent weeks sought information about investment deals involving his son-in-law in New York, a person familiar with the matter said. The son-in-law, Jeffrey Yohai, was accused in a civil suit in New York in November of defrauding a photographer of a $2.9 million investment.\u00a0Mr. Yohai has denied any wrongdoing in a court filing, calling the allegations \u201cextremely derogatory.\u201d\u00a0That suit is pending.Mr. Yohai couldn't be reached for comment.A\u00a0Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in the Los Angeles area requested information on the same deals involving Mr. Yohai, according to the person familiar with the matter.

They have increased residential electricity prices for German households and failed to achieve any meaningful reductions in fossil-fuel consumption or carbon-dioxide emissions.Germany has developed a reputation as a green-energy superpower, but in many respects it isn\u2019t. Of all the energy used in Germany in 2016, 34% came from oil, 23.6% from coal, 22.7% from natural gas, 7.3% from biomass, 6.9% from nuclear, 2.1% from wind power, and 1.2% from solar.

Germans spent $73.5 billion on imported oil in 2013, when the price of Brent crude averaged approximately $108 a barrel. Since then, the U.S. embrace of hydraulic fracturing\u2014also known as \u201cfracking\u201d\u2014has resulted in a surge of U.S. crude oil on the world market, causing global oil prices to fall to about $47 per barrel. Some back-of-the-envelope math suggests Germans may now pay $41.5 billion less per year for their oil imports, constituting an average savings of around $1,107 (at current exchange rates) for each of Germany\u2019s 37.5 million households.Ms. Merkel\u2019s climate and energy policies have caused residential electricity prices in Germany to spike by approximately 47% since 2006, costing the average German household about $380 more a year. The higher prices are largely due to a 10-fold increase in renewable-energy surcharges that guarantee returns for the wind and solar-power industries. These surcharges now make up 23% of German residential electric bills.The German people are paying far more for their household energy needs under Ms. Merkel, yet they have little to show for it. Since 2009, when Germany began to pursue renewables aggressively, annual CO 2 emissions are down a negligible 0.1%.Meanwhile, the U.S. experienced year-over-year reductions in CO 2 emissions in 2015 and 2016, and CO 2  emissions have fallen a dramatic 14% since 2005. This has mostly been made possible by fracking\u2014a practice banned in Germany. Fracking has allowed the U.S. natural-gas industry to compete with coal in a way that wasn\u2019t previously possible, lowering costs for everyone.Slapping around Mr. Trump, who is deeply unpopular in Germany, might score Ms. Merkel some domestic political points. But if the German leader really wants to help the environment, she might consider scaling back the attacks. Without American energy production and exports, Germany\u2014and the world\u2014would be a dirtier, darker and less efficient place.Mr. Orr is a research fellow at the Heartland Institute.", "news_time": "2017-07-17 17:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-should-say-danke-for-u-s-oil-1500326174", "news_title": "Germany Should Say Danke for U.S. Oil", "keywords": "energy,eu,europe,european union,fracking,g-20,germany,merkel,oil,trump,white house,Angela Merkel,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,natural reserves,resources discovery,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,hydropower energy,renewable energy generation,basic materials,resources,electric utilities,natural gas,oil extraction,mining,quarrying,utilities,wind energy"}, {"content": "So       Charlie Gard\u2019s       fate now comes down to this: whether an American doctor can persuade a British judge that little Charlie\u2019s life is worth living.The child cannot see, cannot hear, and suffers from a genetic disorder for which there is no cure\u2014yet he has exposed the great fault line between the post-Christian West and its past. For most of history, men and women have regarded suffering as part of life. But as medicine tames once-deadly afflictions and the idea of some larger meaning to the cosmos wanes, suffering comes to appear less a part of the natural order than an intolerable anomaly.Follow this logic to the end and you will arrive at London\u2019s Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. The hospital dates to 1852, when it was founded by a doctor hoping to relieve \u201cthe shockingly high level of infant mortality.\u201d How curious that this same hospital now argues for infant mortality, or at least for the mortality of one particular infant.Hospital experts say it\u2019s in Charlie\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d that he be denied the experimental treatments because he \u201chas no quality of life.\u201d Better for him to die, they say, than risk suffering. Never mind the judge\u2019s original admission that \u201cno one can be certain whether or not Charlie feels pain.\u201dLet us stipulate a distinction between removing someone from life support, as the hospital proposes, and taking active measures to induce death. Put another way, if       Connie Yates       and       Chris Gard      \u2014Charlie\u2019s parents\u2014decided to remove their son from his ventilator and allow nature to take its course, it would be a difficult but eminently defensible position.But the claim asserted by the representatives of Britain\u2019s state-run health care system is more sweeping and insidious: This is our call, they say. Such is the Great Ormond Street Hospital\u2019s sense of dominion, says Ms. Yates, that it refused to allow Charlie to come home to die, wrapped in the loving arms of his mom and dad.In the Book of Exodus the Israelites are warned that theirs is a \u201cjealous God,\u201d but there is no god more jealous than single-payer health care. For at the heart of single payer is single authority. Isn\u2019t it striking how resentful the legal and health care authorities are that Charlie\u2019s family has raised $1.7 million, thus taking money off the table as an excuse to deny him the offered treatments?Against the emotional outbursts of the parents, the official pronouncements all aim to convey a sense of reasonableness, with soothing references to the law, the selflessness and expertise of those pushing to overrule Charlie\u2019s parents, and, of course, the complexity of the situation.Still, the deck has been stacked from the beginning. The giveaway is the appointment of a guardian to represent Charlie\u2019s interests, even as the court rulings concede it would be difficult to find a more devoted mother and father. Now we learn the lawyer who represents Charlie in court runs a charity with connections\u2014surprise!\u2014to a sister organization that promotes assisted suicide and until 2006 called itself the Voluntary Euthanasia Society.The Great Ormond Street Hospital even wants the last word on love: \u201cIn one respect, Charlie is immensely fortunate\u201d to have such loving parents. Because in this context \u201cin one respect\u201d really means, \u201cnot in the sense that has to do with decisions about their son\u2019s life.\u201d In other words, the parents\u2019 love disqualifies them. In choosing a guardian to represent Charlie against his parents, the courts sided with the doctor who characterized Charlie\u2019s mom and dad as a \u201cspanner in the works.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t long ago that people worried about the cheapening of human life were predicting practices such as legal abortion would lead to the acceptance of things once thought unthinkable. Euthanasia, for example, or the weeding out of children deemed not perfect enough. These people were dismissed as Cassandras. They now look like prophets.Charlie Gard\u2019s story comes after a case in the Netherlands where an elderly women suffering from dementia woke up and resisted as she was about to be euthanized\u2014only to have the doctor order her family to hold her down for the fatal injection. Meanwhile, how many moms and dads of children with Down syndrome have had complete strangers come up to ask, \u201cDidn\u2019t you have a test?\u201d Translation: Surely you wouldn\u2019t have had this child had you known.The essence of civilization is that the strong protect the weak. But Charlie Gard shows that the barbarian no longer comes wielding a club and grunting in some undecipherable tongue. These days the barbarian comes as an expert, possessed of all the requisite certification\u2014and an unquestioned faith in his absolute right to impose final judgments about the \u201cquality of life\u201d of other people\u2019s loved ones.Write to mcgurn@wsj.com.Correction  The lawyer who represents Charlie Gard in court runs a charity with ties to an organization that promotes assisted suicide.

Kim Jong Un       wants to reunify the Korean Peninsula under his rule and eject America from the region. North Korea\u2019s actions since the first nuclear crisis, more than two decades ago, show this is not mere talk. The regime has used every agreement for 20 years to build more weapons and extort more money. Mr. Kim is close to having a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile, threatening the U.S. and its allies. The only solution is to remove him. But how?A war would be extremely costly. The better choice\u2014though still not an easy one\u2014is to put serious pressure on China to cut off its trade with North Korea. At the same time, the U.S. should make clear it is open to working with Beijing to replace Mr. Kim with a regime willing to forgo weapons of mass destruction.The coercion of China should be two-pronged. First, the U.S. should further tighten its alliance with Japan and South Korea, forcing Beijing to reckon with its encirclement in Northeast Asia. For China, a well-armed, interlinked Northeast alliance system is a strategic catastrophe.But the real change would be to move from pinprick sanctions on Chinese companies doing business with North Korea to economic coercion. North Korea is already effectively under a global embargo\u2014with one glaring exception. Pyongyang\u2019s trade with China\u2014which accounts for 90% of its total trade\u2014has increased in recent years, customs data show.North Korea receives almost all its imports from China, including oil products. Chinese minerals feed Pyongyang\u2019s industrial and military production. Payments sent for North Korean seafood and textiles serve the same purpose.Rising trade is no accident. China and North Korea have recently created shipping and modern rail routes to boost trade. The Guomenwan border trade zone that opened in October 2015 in Dandong, China, was established to promote bilateral economic links. These moves mock the United Nations sanctions to which China has pledged fidelity.This obviously undermines U.S. interests, and it is time to respond meaningfully. A few companies that do business with North Korea are under international sanctions, but this imposes little cost on China. Often companies cease their activity (or disappear entirely), and new ones arise to replace them.True sanctions would go further. It\u2019s a sham to pick out individual Chinese enterprises for sanctions as if they are independent of the government. The Communist Party can control the economy. Many Chinese companies are simply interchangeable tools, used by the party at different times for different purposes.The West should not play China\u2019s shell game. Beijing should not be allowed to effectively determine who is subjected to sanctions for North Korean links, as if these are rogue entities that have nothing to do with the party-state. One Chinese state bank should not be allowed to do global business while another suborns North Korea.The correct targets are the huge state-owned sisters of the entities doing business with North Korea, those with sizable international business and assets. When it comes to China\u2019s support for North Korea, there is little difference between, say, one state-sponsored metals firm and another. Don\u2019t impose sanctions only on Limac Corp. for its supposed venture in the North; put them also on Minmetals, the dominant firm and a major global presence. Don\u2019t stop at penalizing Dalian Global Unity Shipping as if it\u2019s separate from the Chinese state; target kingpin China Ocean Shipping. Don\u2019t subject Bank of Dandong to sanctions without also targeting the behemoth             Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.This is what a serious attempt to change Chinese behavior would look like. It would put enormous pressure on the Communist Party to relieve the pain inflicted on Chinese elites. Such economic coercion has not been tried because it is risky. If sanctions actually begin to hurt China, Beijing will retaliate before it cooperates. The recently announced Sino-American beef deal will be first in the firing line, along with U.S. exports of soybeans, aircraft and other goods and services. Many will fret that the U.S. is causing instability. But Americans have to choose: Is economic tension with China as bad as a nuclear-armed North Korea?Or is North Korea a \u201cclear and present danger,\u201d as Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       has said? If so, all means short of war should be used to depose Mr. Kim. The tension with China needn\u2019t be permanent: Sanctions would vanish if China helps remove the Kim regime and works toward a peaceful peninsula. The other option is to live with a nuclear-armed Kim Jong Un.Mr. Blumenthal is director of Asian studies and Mr. Scissors a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.", "news_time": "2017-07-17 17:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/forcing-chinas-hand-on-north-korea-1500326138", "news_title": "Forcing China\u2019s Hand on North Korea", "keywords": "china,kim jong un,north korea,sanctions,trump,xi jinping,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "The       Trump       administration in May began the process of replacing the small army of outside science advisers at the Environmental Protection Agency. In June, 38 additional EPA advisers were notified that their appointments would not be renewed in August. To Mr. Trump\u2019s critics, this is another manifestation of his administration\u2019s \u201cwar on science.\u201d Histrionics aside, the administration\u2019s actions are long overdue.The most prominent of the EPA\u2019s myriad boards of outside advisers are the Science Advisory Board and the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, or CASAC. Mostly made up of university professors, these boards also frequently draw members from consulting firms and activist groups. Only rarely do members have backgrounds in industry. All EPA boards are governed by the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires that they be balanced and unbiased. While the EPA is required by law to convene the SAB and CASAC, the agency is not bound by law to heed their advice.The EPA\u2019s       Obama      -era \u201cwar on coal\u201d rules and its standards for ground-level ozone\u2014possibly the most expensive EPA rule ever issued\u2014depend on the same scientifically unsupported notion that the fine particles of soot emitted by smokestacks and tailpipes are lethal. The EPA claims that such particles kill hundreds of thousands of Americans annually.The EPA first considered regulating fine particles in the mid-1990s. But when the agency ran its claims past CASAC in 1996, the board concluded that the scientific evidence did not support the agency\u2019s regulatory conclusion. Ignoring the panel\u2019s advice, the EPA\u2019s leadership chose to regulate fine particles anyway, and resolved to figure out a way to avoid future troublesome opposition from CASAC.In 1996 two-thirds of the CASAC panel had no financial connection to the EPA. By the mid-2000s, the agency had entirely flipped the composition of the advisory board so two-thirds of its members were agency grantees. Lo and behold, CASAC suddenly agreed with the EPA\u2019s leadership that fine particulates in outdoor air kill. During the Obama years, the EPA packed the CASAC panel. Twenty-four of its 26 members are now agency grantees, with some listed as principal investigators on EPA research grants worth more than $220 million.Although the scientific case against particulate matter hasn\u2019t improved since the 1990s, the EPA has tightened its grip on CASAC. In effect, EPA-funded researchers are empowered to review and approve their own work in order to rubber-stamp the EPA\u2019s regulatory agenda. This is all done under the guise of \u201cindependence.\u201dAnother \u201cindependent\u201d CASAC committee conducted the most recent review of the Obama EPA\u2019s ground-level ozone standards. Of that panel\u2019s 20 members, 70% were EPA grantees who\u2019d hauled in more than $192 million from the agency over the years. These EPA panels make decisions by consensus, which has lately been easy enough to achieve considering they are usually chaired by an EPA grantee.Would-be reformers have so far had no luck changing the culture at these EPA advisory committees. In 2016 the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, where I am a senior fellow, sued the agency. We alleged that the CASAC fine-particulate subcommittee was biased\u2014a clear violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. We found a plaintiff who had been refused CASAC membership because of his beliefs about fine particles. Unfortunately, that individual was not willing to take a hostile public stand against the EPA for fear of professional retribution. We ultimately withdrew the suit.The EPA\u2019s opaque selection process for membership on its advisory boards has opened the agency to charges of bias. In 2016 Michael Honeycutt, chief toxicologist of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, was recommended in 60 of the 83 nominations to the EPA for CASAC membership. The EPA instead selected       Donna Kenski       of the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium. Ms. Kenski received only one of the 83 recommendations. While no one objected to Mr. Honeycutt\u2019s nomination, Sen.       James Inhofe       (R., Okla.) lodged an objection to Ms. Kenski\u2019s nomination, claiming she had exhibited partisanship during an earlier term on the committee.Congress has also tried to reform the EPA\u2019s science advisory process. During the three most recent Congresses, the House has passed bills to provide explicit conflict-of-interest rules for EPA science advisers, including bans on receiving EPA grants for three years before and after service on an advisory panel. The bills went nowhere in the Senate, where the threat of a Democrat-led filibuster loomed. Had they passed, President Obama surely would have vetoed them.President Trump and his EPA administrator have ample statutory authority to rectify the problem. As Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general,       Scott Pruitt       spent years familiarizing himself with the EPA\u2019s unlawful ways. He is in the process of reaffirming the independence of the agency\u2019s science advisory committees. This won\u2019t mean that committee members can\u2019t have a point of view. But a committee as a whole must be balanced and unbiased.

Without fundamental change, Medicaid\u2014expanded or not\u2014will push state budgets to the brink even as it fails to help the most financially vulnerable Americans.Consider Oklahoma, our home state. Despite intense lobbying by hospital corporations, the state Legislature stood strong and refused the Medicaid expansion. But the Medicaid rolls increased anyway, and at a dramatic cost to priorities like education, public safety and transportation.Like most states, Oklahoma used to spend most of its funds on education. But a few years ago Medicaid\u2019s rapidly rising costs pushed it to the top of the budget. Today, Oklahoma spends $5.1 billion a year on Medicaid, more than the $3.4 billion a year for K-12 schools and $942 million a year for higher education combined. Medicaid is now crowding out other state priorities, with real consequences in education and beyond: lower teacher pay, fewer textbooks, deferred road maintenance, fewer mental-health treatment options in the state justice system to prevent incarceration of nonviolent offenders, and\u2014within the Medicaid program itself\u2014lower reimbursement rates for doctors.Something has to give. If policy makers want to preserve a functioning and reliable safety net for low-income citizens with serious health challenges, they must face the fact that Medicaid is failing.The ObamaCare expansion sent Medicaid\u2019s already soaring costs even higher. It dramatically increased spending in states like Illinois, Ohio and Washington, which were lured by temporary federal funds and rosy projections for economic recovery after the 2007-09 recession. What\u2019s particularly perverse is that ObamaCare pays states more for the able-bodied adults newly covered under the Medicaid expansion than for people with serious disabilities under the original program.As Illinois expanded Medicaid, more than 800 people already on the program\u2019s waiting list died, according to state documents reviewed by the Foundation for Government Accountability. Even in states that refused the expansion, surging costs have cut people off from care while leaving them still technically \u201ccovered.\u201dMedicaid\u2019s unsustainable path was paved by the incentives built into its structure, combined with earlier expansions like the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, passed in 1997. Oklahoma\u2019s share of spending on Medicaid in 2003 was $714 million. By 2016 that had ballooned to $2.1 billion, an increase of 194.1%, according to the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, the agency responsible for administering Medicaid in Oklahoma. No other significant piece of the state budget grew so fast.Over the same period, enrollment in Oklahoma skyrocketed from just under 500,000 to over a million. This means one-quarter of the state\u2019s population is on medical welfare. Medicaid covers 57% of all births in Oklahoma, according to the Oklahoma Health Care Authority. Up to 72% of all children are on Medicaid at some point in their first five years, according to the authority. Government dependency expanded during a period of significant income growth here. Per capita income in Oklahoma grew 70.9%, from $26,720 in 2003 to $45,682 in 2016, according to federal data at the Bureau of Economic Analysis.Part of the problem is that politicians want to score points by getting people \u201ccovered.\u201d But ObamaCare\u2019s monomaniacal focus on coverage has led to shoddier care at higher costs. Today\u2019s health-care debate should aim at the opposite: increasing the quality of care, not merely coverage by insurance or welfare.A start would be refocusing Medicaid on its original mission of caring for the poor and those unable to do it for themselves. That means changing the program\u2019s incentives to allow people more responsibility for their own health outcomes. It also means giving states the freedom to explore options like health savings accounts, direct primary care for Medicaid patients, and systems to remove enrollees who abuse the program.Now is the time for fundamental Medicaid reform\u2014for the good of every state and the most vulnerable people who depend on the program.Mr. Keating served as governor of Oklahoma, 1995-2003.

They also say the agency\u2019s work duplicates efforts at the Department of Homeland Security and FBI and that it improperly interferes in the right of states to conduct their elections.\u201cPeople supporting the EAC are quite frankly proponents for a greater federal role in our elections,\u201d said Rep.

We do not have a federally run election system.\u201dHowever, Democrats have said Russian meddling in the 2016 election has boosted the importance of the EAC. The agency helps train local officials on such tasks as recruiting poll workers and, during last year\u2019s campaign, distributed memos keeping election officials apprised on potential vulnerabilities in voting systems.The commission \u201chas a unique task that they\u2019re best situated to accomplish,\u201d said Rep.       Mike Quigley,        an Illinois Democrat who has been fighting to preserve the agency.Mr. Quigly said that the intelligence community judgment that Russian President       Vladimir Putin      \u00a0ordered a campaign of interference in the 2016 election makes it the \u201cworst time\u201d to try to eliminate the agency.\u201cCutting funding to it is a green light to Putin to do it again,\u201d said Mr.\u00a0Quigley.The Election Assistance Commission said in December it was \u201cworking with federal law enforcement agencies to investigate the potential breach and its effects.\u201d It said recently it has thoroughly scanned its systems to make sure there are no additional security concerns.The commission provides election-management guidelines and develops specifications for certifying voting systems,\u00a0though responsibility\u00a0for administering elections ultimately falls to state and local governments.The hacking probe is being conducted at the same time the FBI is undertaking a broader investigation into Russia meddling in the 2016 presidential election, including attempts to get into state election databases, and whether anyone working with President       Donald Trump\u2019s       campaign colluded in the effort. Mr. Trump and his campaign have denied any collusion with Russian hacking.It is unclear if the EAC hack is part of that review; the FBI declined to comment on the matter.The hack appeared to include a breach of the EAC\u2019s administrative-access credentials as well as access to nonpublic reports on flaws in voting machines, according to       Andrei Barysevich,        an analyst with cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.Access to the reports could have allowed someone to exploit flaws in voting machines, Mr. Barysevich said. The stolen credentials could have been used to install malicious code on the EAC site, thus potentially infecting any user of it. The users could include state election officials, who might then use a thumb memory stick to interact with other machines, such as ballot machines not connected to the internet.The security firm, which assessed the hack as having likely occurred in November, turned the information over to law enforcement in December, and Mr. Barysevich has been cooperating with the FBI on its probe.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the EAC\u2019s reservoir that can\u2019t be found elsewhere but it certainly is an attractive place to look,\u201d said\u00a0      Gregory\u00a0Miller,        co-founder of the nonprofit Open Source Election Technology Institute, which works to build secure voting technology and systems. \u201cThe hack should be concerning because it continues to demonstrate a pattern of behavior and methodology\u201d regarding the targeting of election systems, he said.The hack was discovered Dec. 1 by Recorded Future, which for one month prior had been tracking a hacker it dubbed \u201cRasputin.\u201dThe hacker had used the same technique to penetrate other systems that Recorded Future had been monitoring, Mr. Barysevich said, and in December the firm spotted \u201cRasputin\u201d in an underground market attempting to sell the EAC credentials to \u201cunfriendly\u201d Middle Eastern governments.\u201cRasputin\u201d didn\u2019t appear to understand the value of the information he or she had obtained, and attempted to sell it for less than $10,000, Mr. Barysevich added.A person familiar with the probe said the FBI has \u201cmade significant progress\u201d in its investigation.Jillian Stickels,        an FBI spokeswoman, declined to comment on the EAC investigation beyond pointing to a statement the bureau issued in December that\u00a0said it is investigating the cyberattack.A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which Mr. Barysevich said he also notified of the hack in December, directed a reporter\u2019s inquiry to the FBI.Before the election, the department had warned states of hackers attempting to target voting systems and provided a program of periodic checks for any vulnerabilities. The DHS spokesman didn\u2019t respond to an additional inquiry about whether it issued any warnings to EAC that its own system was being targeted.A spokeswoman for the EAC,       Brenda Soder,        said the commission didn\u2019t have DHS scan its system to detect for any vulnerability before the attack, and noted that DHS doesn\u2019t provide remedial support to rebuild or repair systems.\u201cFollowing the December incident, we did proactively invite DHS in to run a top to bottom check of our system, including our networks, hardware, and security protections,\u201d she said.Since the election, current and former U.S. officials, including those from DHS, have said Russian government hackers targeted voting systems in nearly two dozen states last year, aiming to undermine public faith in the integrity and legitimacy of U.S. elections.Mr. Barysevich, Recorded Future\u2019s director of advanced collection, said it is unclear based on his communication with the FBI whether the agency is considering the EAC hack as potentially related to any broader questions of Russian meddling in the election.The hacker appeared to have accessed the information at least two weeks before Recorded Future\u2019s identification of him or her on\u00a0Dec. 1, according to Mr. Barysevich, who said he based that timeline on when \u201cRasputin\u201d was attempting to sell the credentials.In previous hacks, the hacker had attempted to sell credentials to other sites almost immediately after acquiring them, and in the case of the EAC, the attempted sale took place in mid-November, Mr. Barysevich said.Write to Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 17:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-seeks-to-close-federal-election-agency-1500325218", "news_title": "GOP Seeks to Close Federal Election Agency", "keywords": "2016 election,election hacking,hacker,hillary clinton,presidential campaign,putin,russia,russian hacking,trump,Federal Bureau of Investigation,U.S. Election Assistance Commission,Donald Trump,Vladimir Putin,political,general news,crime,legal action,cybercrime,hacking,independent advisory bodies,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Charles Scharf is returning to Wall Street as the new chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon Corp., placing a retail banking veteran in charge of a firm that safeguards trillions of dollars for big institutions.Mr. Scharf, 52 years old, replaced Gerald Hassell as CEO Monday. The 65-year-old Mr. Hassell will remain chairman at BNY Mellon until Dec. 31, when he will hand the title to Mr. Scharf.Mr. Scharf\u2019s challenge will be to jump-start growth and navigate the technological changes sweeping through the financial-services industry. The New York company responded to pressure earlier this decade from shareholders, including activist Trian Fund Management LP, to cut costs during a period of low interest rates. Profits have improved, but revenue growth remains tepid.Mr. Hassell planned to retire once the firm showed progress on a series of goals set in 2014, according to the BNY Mellon CEO and       Ed Garden,        Trian\u2019s chief investment officer and a BNY Mellon director. Trian didn\u2019t push for a change in leadership, Mr. Hassell said in an interview.\u201cI have enjoyed a highly collaborative and constructive relationship with Gerald and am excited to welcome Charlie to BNY Mellon,\u201d Mr. Garden said in a statement.BNY Mellon\u2019s shares rose 1.9% and closed at $53.35 on Monday. They have climbed 32% in the past year, underperforming the benchmark KBW Bank Index\u2019s 43% gain.The appointment gives Mr. Scharf a second chance at running a public company. He left the top post at San Francisco payments network             Visa Inc.       in 2016 so he could be closer to his family in New York.Before heading to Visa in 2012, Mr. Scharf worked in the banking industry, including a seven-year stint running the enormous retail-banking division of             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co.A top lieutenant to J.P. Morgan Chief Executive       James Dimon       for roughly two decades, Mr. Scharf was at one time considered a potential successor. He left J.P. Morgan in 2012.Mr. Scharf had been eager to return to his roots at a large financial firm, people familiar with the matter said. On Monday he said in an interview that he weighed options inside and outside the financial-services industry before concluding BNY Mellon \u201cwas one of the most exciting places to be\u201d given the company\u2019s central role in the world\u2019s financial system.The bank now has more than $30 trillion in assets under custody, and runs a collection of investment managers that oversee a combined $1.7 trillion.Mr. Hassell spent his entire career at BNY Mellon. He was named CEO in 2011 when the company was still coming to terms with the lasting effects of a financial downturn. Low interest rates crimped its profits, and the bank\u2019s margins lagged behind those of rivals             State Street Corp.       and             Northern Trust Corp.He also had to wrestle with demands made by Trian, which purchased a stake in June 2014 and sought cost cuts. In October 2014, BNY Mellon unveiled plans to shed $500 million in expenses through 2017. That December, the company added Trian\u2019s Mr. Garden to its board.The cuts and investments in technology helped lift profits even as revenue growth languished below some of BNY Mellon\u2019s biggest peers, Evercore ISI analyst       Glenn Schorr       said. In 2016, the bank reached many of its targets Mr. Hassell set in 2014, including those on its return on equity and operating margin.Yet competition in the firm\u2019s core custody business has made it more difficult for BNY Mellon and its rivals to charge higher fees.\u201cTheir business size and client mix has shown limited growth,\u201d Mr. Schorr said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Charlie or anyone else in the world can impact that.\u201dBNY Mellon, like its rivals, plans to develop analytics and other tools that harness the reams of data produced by its custody business. The company may also look to expand its markets business beyond its main currency-trading arm.\u201cBecause of digitization, there are more opportunities to do things for clients if you have the right kind of structure,\u201d Mr. Scharf said.Conversations about who would succeed him \u201chave been under way for several years,\u201d Mr. Hassell said. The outgoing CEO turns 66 this year.The company retained             Korn/Ferry International                   to lead the search, and weighed several internal and external candidates. Several shareholders, though, expected BNY Mellon to choose an outsider.Korn/Ferry reached out to Mr. Scharf late last year, and eventually introduced him to the board, a BNY Mellon spokeswoman said.\u201cCharlie became not only available, but the best person for the job,\u201d Mr. Hassell said.In a memo to employees Monday, Mr. Scharf said \u201cI know change is never easy, but I will do my best to make it smooth.\u201d\u2014Emily Glazer contributed to this article.Write to Justin Baer at justin.baer@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'BNY Mellon Taps Ex-Chief of Visa To Head Bank.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 16:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-new-york-mellon-names-former-visa-executive-scharf-ceo-and-chairman-1500291920", "news_title": "BNY Mellon Names Former Visa Executive Charles Scharf as CEO, Chairman", "keywords": "banking,bank of new york mellon ,banks,bny mellon ceo,ceos, chairman,charles scharf ,chief executive,commercial banking, gerald hassell,investors,markets,new ceo,personnel moves,shares,trian,visa executive,Bank of New York Mellon,BK,Citigroup,C,Northern Trust,NTRS,State Street,STT,Trian Fund Management,J.P.

That was 5.7% more than the same month last year.Container imports rose 5.1% at the Port of Oakland last month, to 80,253 TEUs, while inbound volume reported by the Virginia Port Authority was up 10% to 103,006 TEUs.The latest monthly Global Port Tracker report, issued by National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates LLC, estimates total container import volume across major U.S. ports of 1.66 million TEUs in June, up 5.3% from a year ago. The report projected that monthly volumes will continue to expand year-over-year through October, with more than 1.7 million import TEUs expected in July and nearly 1.8 million TEUs in August.Portland, Ore.-based freight forwarder OIA Global, which handles goods for athletic and outdoor retailers, says the prospect of further deregulation under the Trump administration has driven optimism among its clients.\u201cIt\u2019s a very positive business environment,\u201d said Jerry Levy of OIA Global, adding that many of the firm\u2019s customers are restocking inventories as they enter the busier season. \u201cThe volumes are well ahead of last year\u2026People are very optimistic on our economy right now.\u201dThe volume increases came as China\u2019s exports rose 11.3% year over year, marking the fourth month in a row of gains. June also saw demand improving for trucking and logistics services in the U.S., as spot rates rose fueling hopes for a broader freight recovery.Still, some analysts say concerns over the threat of new import tariffs from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration may also be driving some of the import growth as companies try to get ahead of potential new constraints.Chris Rogers, an analyst with trade data firm Panjiva, said there has been significant growth since January in import segments that face possible tariff restrictions. Shipments of steel were up 26.5% and automotive-industry imports\u2014including cars and parts\u2014were up 8.9% in June.\u201cWe have a very high level of uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cIf Trump moves this month on steel, that\u2019s a sign to everybody who is an exporter to the U.S. that when actions happen, they happen quickly\u2014you should get in while you can.\u201d But, he added, \u201cIf by this time next month nothing has happened on steel and automobiles, they might all say, let\u2019s get on with it and go back to business as usual.\u201dThat could leave businesses that stocked up in June with higher inventories than they need in the coming months.According to the Commerce Department, consumer spending at U.S. retailers declined for the second straight month in June. Researchers at the University of Michigan reported last week a decline in the consumer-sentiment index\u2014the second straight monthly decline.\u201cCertainly in selected industries I\u2019d say there\u2019s a very real chance of an oversupply of inventory,\u201d Mr. Rogers said.Write to Erica E.

And now they\u2019re for sale.Rockets executive Tad Brown said Monday afternoon that owner Leslie Alexander is selling the team he\u2019s owned since 1993\u2014a sudden, unexpected announcement that stunned people across the league and started a process that seems likely to end in the frothiest auction the league has ever seen.The valuation of NBA teams has skyrocketed in recent years because of its lucrative media deals and the current generation of electrifying players, and it was only a matter of time before some of the league\u2019s old-guard owners cashed in.What happened with the last franchises to hit the open market suggests that Houston could sell for the highest price of any team in NBA history.It\u2019s unusual for any NBA team to be up for grabs. It\u2019s even rarer for a team like the Rockets to be available. They have two star players, a stable future, international appeal because of       Yao Ming       and a bright front office in one of the league\u2019s biggest markets.

Better than anyone, he understands why he told so many whoppers to get it enacted.Mr. Obama falsely promised Americans that they could keep their doctors and their health plans and that they would even pay lower insurance premiums. Clearly, the architect of ObamaCare understood that promising to achieve leftist aims of more spending, more taxing, more regulating and more people enrolled in government programs was not enough to make the political sale. Yet amazingly, several wavering Republicans have accepted precisely these metrics of the welfare state in their new definition of policy success. Instead, GOP lawmakers should reflect on how to make Americans healthier.Bullied by Democrats, several GOP senators have succeeded in preserving ObamaCare\u2019s tax hikes. The Journal\u2019s Richard Rubin reports today:Good question from the esteemed Mr. Kudlow, but before writing off all the wavering Republicans as gutless, let\u2019s consider the possibility that some of them have tried to examine the policy trees and simply lost sight of the health care forest.The liberal premise that inspired what Mr. Kudlow might call the Great GOP Tax \u201cWuss-out\u201d of 2017 is that every dollar taken from a person making more than $200,000 will be spent on needed and timely medical care for a less-affluent person and thus Americans will be better off.It\u2019s more accurate to say that the captured tax dollar will be allocated by politicians and bureaucrats in a government system that is intended to provide quality health care but that frequently falls short, and at unsustainable cost.This week lawmakers are awaiting the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s \u201cscore\u201d of Mr. McConnell\u2019s latest draft of an ObamaCare rewrite. By Beltway custom, lawmakers will look to see how many people CBO expects to be enrolled in government health plans in the future and for some reason even some Republicans now view higher enrollment numbers as success.Yet other CBO reports describe why this contributes to a looming catastrophe. In its long-term outlook released in March, CBO explained how entitlement programs and interest on the federal debt are creating the conditions for a fiscal armageddon:In perhaps the most misleading part of the current Senate debate, GOP lawmakers are discussing whether or not to begin slightly restraining the growth of Medicaid spending starting in 2025 by employing a different measurement of inflation. But the real alternative is not the status quo\u2014as CBO has noted over and over, budget reforms will need to be more radical the longer politicians wait to enact them.Perhaps radical surgery will be needed, because the other awkward fact is that enrolling people in Medicaid means they will have fewer doctors available to treat them and worse health outcomes than people with private insurance\u2014and often even worse than people without any insurance at all. Long before he became the head of the Food and Drug Administration,       Dr. Scott Gottlieb      wrote on this subject for the Journal in 2011. He described some of the relevant research:This column recently noted the disturbing news that, for the first time in decades, U.S. life expectancy posted a decline in 2015. Many medical researchers might say that it\u2019s too soon to pronounce ObamaCare a complete failure in improving public health. But there is a consensus that wealthier people tend to be healthier. And patient health should be the priority as lawmakers enact reform.Even if Mr. Obama had no intention of delivering on his promises, he seems to have understood\u2014at least when he was marketing his insurance overhaul\u2014that what Americans really needed was consumer choice and affordable care. They still do.Republicans should allow Americans to generate the wealth that enables them to buy affordable varieties of private insurance, which yields better care than government insurance. Alternatively, a government debt crisis would be very hazardous to our health.***Bottom Stories of the DayNow He Tells Her  \u201c      Bill Clinton      : If You Want To Be President, You Have To Know Why The Heck You\u2019re Running,\u201d RealClearPolitics, July 14The Soft Bigotry of Low Expectations  \u201cFirst Lady Melania Trump Is More Popular Than First Lady       Hillary Clinton       Was,\u201d Independent Journal Review, July 10Beginning of a Beautiful Friendship, Or Something  \u201cAu revoir!

Yields fall when bond prices rise.Bond prices got a boost last Wednesday when Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       said in congressional testimony that the central bank could reassess its plan to raise interest-rates if inflation remains stuck below its 2% annual target. On Friday, that message was reinforced by a report showing a further slowdown in inflation.While the Fed has raised interest rates twice this year, investors are now increasingly skeptical that there will be another rate increase this year.Investors are \u201ccontinuing trying to process what happened last week with the combination of the inflation data and what we heard from Yellen in Washington,\u201d said       Thomas Simons,        senior vice president and money-market economist in the fixed-income group at Jefferies LLC.This week is relatively light on economic data, and no Fed officials are scheduled to talk ahead of their July 25-26 policy meeting.One major event is Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, which will be closely watched for signs that the ECB is planning to scale back its monetary stimulus.Concern among investors that major central banks outside of the U.S. could shift to tighter monetary policy was a big factor behind a recent selloff in global debt.Yields did rise last week following a report from The Wall Street Journal that ECB President       Mario Draghi       is scheduled to address the Federal Reserve\u2019s Jackson Hole conference in August.Mr. Draghi is expected to give further signs of the ECB\u2019s growing confidence in the eurozone economy and its reduced need for monetary stimulus, the Journal reported.Write to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 16:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-government-bonds-steady-after-recent-gains-1500303761", "news_title": "U.S. Government Bond Prices Edge Higher", "keywords": "bond prices,government bonds,interest rates,treasury report,treasurys,treasury yields,Federal Reserve,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "In a surprising move that also comes at a strange point in the calendar, the Carolina Panthers fired general manager Dave Gettleman, removing the architect of a team that in less than two weeks will take the field for training camp.\u201cWhile the timing of this decision is not ideal, a change is needed,\u201d owner Jerry Richardson said in a statement Monday.Gettleman\u2019s firing isn\u2019t just unusual because it came in the middle of July. It\u2019s also because of the Panthers\u2019 success. In Gettleman\u2019s four years as             GM,       Carolina made the playoffs three times and won an NFC championship.In any other offseason, the move might seem even more bizarre\u2014except something similar happened last month. That\u2019s when Kansas City, a team that also reached the playoffs in three of the last four seasons, parted ways with its general manager, John Dorsey.In both cases, the executives were entrusted to build rosters that are expected to compete for playoff spots this year. They went through the draft, signed free agents\u2014and then after that, were told to pack their bags.But unlike the Chiefs, the Panthers didn\u2019t make the playoffs last season. Carolina went 6-10 while the Falcons ran away with the NFC South title. Still, a year and a half ago Gettleman\u2019s Panthers had finished 15-1 and played the Broncos in the Super Bowl.While the Panthers built around star quarterback Cam Newton and have produced one of the best records in the league during Gettleman\u2019s tenure, he also oversaw the departure of several high-profile players and franchise icons. Those included Josh Norman, DeAngelo Williams and Steve Smith, who on Monday seemed to endorse the move to get rid of Gettleman in a handful of tweets.The one takeaway may be that any and all points during the year have become firing season in the NFL. There\u2019s a typical array of departures in January, after the regular season ends. That happened this year too, but then they never stopped.The Redskins waited until March to fire Scot McCloughan. Then in April\u2014a day after the NFL Draft wrapped up\u2014the Bills fired Doug Whaley.

But these days, it often feels as if there is a direct connection between the two locales\u2014at least in an artistic sense.That is because Poughkeepsie is home to Vassar College and its Powerhouse Theater festival, a six-week summer event that brings about 350 actors, directors, playwrights and other dramatic professionals to the city of about 30,000. Productions take place at theaters throughout the campus; all the participants live at Vassar as well.Plenty of the talent comes from New York City. But just as important, what is presented at Powerhouse often finds its way back to the Big Apple. The 33-year-old festival has become a significant incubator for fresh work, with such shows as the blockbuster musical \u201cHamilton\u201d and the Tony Award-winning drama \u201cThe Humans\u201d having been showcased at Powerhouse before landing on Broadway.Indeed, for many in New York\u2019s theater community, the festival, a collaboration between Vassar and the nonprofit New York Stage and Film organization, has become a de facto pit stop. Or, at the very least, a place where an artist is free to think, unwind and, most critically, create.\u201cIt is one of the safest, yet stimulating places,\u201d said the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright       John Patrick Shanley,        who has developed several works at Powerhouse over the years.This summer, the Powerhouse tradition continues, with the festival running through\u00a0July 30. Though Mr. Shanley won\u2019t be on hand, several other prominent artists already have, or are making their way to, the festival.Josh Radnor,        best known as an actor on the hit sitcom \u201cHow I Met Your Mother,\u201d unveiled one of his plays, \u201cSacred Valley,\u201d in a production that concluded July 9. \u201cThe Secret Life of Bees,\u201d a new musical from playwright       Lynn Nottage       and composer Duncan Sheik, both Broadway veterans, will be presented July 27-30.In all, Powerhouse, which is run on a $1.2 million budget, offers more than a dozen works during the course of its season, though some are seen just in readings.The festival also has an educational component. About 40 actors, playwrights and directors attend an intensive training program, with a tuition of $5,000, and present their productions during the season.Powerhouse isn\u2019t the only summer program that is focused on developing new work. In New York City, for example, there is the New York Musical Festival, which opened July 10 and runs through\u00a0Aug. 6.But Powerhouse officials and artists connected to the festival say the fact its program isn\u2019t in New York City works to its advantage because the escape from the hustle and bustle allows for more creativity and experimentation. The festival also sees to it that no theater critics are allowed to review the productions, so artists are additionally shielded from the outside world as they develop their work.Even the more polished Powerhouse productions aren\u2019t considered finished, explains       Johanna Pfaelzer,        New York Stage and Film\u2019s artistic director. \u201cOne of our hallmarks is recognizing the work is in its incubation phase,\u201d she said.Still, the projects are enough of a draw that about 10,000 people attend the festival annually, according to festival officials. Some are Broadway producers seeking the next big thing, but the majority are theater-loving locals who appreciate being a test market of sorts.Donna Perry,        a retiree who lives in the Poughkeepsie area, counts herself among the Powerhouse fans. The shows \u201caren\u2019t always ready for prime time,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they all have something to say.\u201dWrite to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'Creative Freedom Thrives at Festival.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 16:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/artists-flex-creative-muscles-at-n-y-area-theater-festival-1500322757", "news_title": "Artists Flex Creative Muscles at N.Y.-Area Theater Festival ", "keywords": "stage,summer theater,theater,Vassar College,political,general news,arts,entertainment,festivals"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A fight between regulators escalated Monday when President Trump\u2019s acting national banking regulator urged the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to delay a rule barring mandatory arbitration requirements between financial firms and customers.Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika Monday asked CFPB Director       Richard Cordray       to halt the rule, which could ease the way for class-action litigation against companies, until his office can assess the data behind the rule and\u00a0verify it won\u2019t put banks in financial risk.The letter is the third between Mr. Noreika and Mr. Cordray since the CFPB announced its arbitration rule last Monday.\u201cThe OCC should be granted the opportunity to conduct an independent review of the CFPB data to determine the safety and soundness implications of the Final Rule,\u201d Mr. Noreika wrote.CFPB spokesman David Mayorga said the bureau received the letter and is reviewing it.Mr. Noreika raised concerns about the rule the day it was announced by the CFPB, saying it presented potential risks for banks. He said the CFPB rule could allow lawsuits that could harm a bank\u2019s reputation and financial performance, and ultimately drive up bank costs on consumers.Mr. Cordray responded to the acting comptroller on Wednesday, saying he was \u201csurprised\u201d by the OCC\u2019s letter. \u201cAt no time during the (two-year process of preparing the rule) did anyone from the OCC express any suggestion that the rule that was under development could threaten the safety and soundness of the banking system,\u201d Mr. Cordray said in the July 12 letter.Mr. Noreika\u2019s Monday response said Mr. Cordray continues to ignore his request for data despite \u201cprior telephonic and in-person assurances that we would have access.\u201dThe back-and-forth between the two regulators could increase the chance congressional Republicans attempt to step in and stop the arbitration rule. Senate Republicans, for instance, are considering steps to overturn it and House Republicans are looking into whether they could hold Mr. Cordray in contempt for not complying with information requests related to the rule.Mr. Cordray, who was appointed by former President       Barack Obama,        is serving a term that ends in July 2018.Mr. Noreika and Mr. Cordray are members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a government body consisting of top regulators that has the authority to delay proposed rules by the CFPB.The rule is scheduled to become binding in March 2018.Write to Rachel Witkowski at rachel.witkowski@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'Arbitration Fight Heats Up.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 16:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/banking-regulator-urges-cfpb-to-delay-rule-barring-mandatory-arbitration-1500313048", "news_title": "Banking Regulator Urges CFPB to Delay Rule Barring Mandatory Arbitration ", "keywords": "banking,cfpb,regulation,Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,Richard Cordray,Keith Noreika,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department"}, {"content": "The dollar stabilized Monday ahead of major central-bank meetings later in the week.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, ticked up less than 0.1% to 87.35.

PG 0.45%       Worth $222 billion, P&G is the largest company to ever face such a campaign.Because of P&G\u2019s size, Trian\u2019s ability to win support from other investors will be in a particularly bright spotlight, and it will have to convince them that its brand of activism can help companies and not distract from work already being done. P&G rejected naming Mr. Peltz to the board and said in a statement it \u201cis confident that the changes being made are producing results.\u201dTypically, Trian has tried to avoid the perception it fights companies. It has branded itself as a \u201chighly engaged shareholder,\u201d not an activist, but instead a sort of uber-adviser to executives and boards. It seeks a board seat at nearly all of its companies so that it can tap the \u201cperfect information\u201d only insiders have and can change the discussion about what is working and what isn\u2019t.Trian\u2019s performance lately has lagged behind broader markets. A major Trian fund is up 1.5% through the first week in July, according to an investor document, dragged down by a 15% slump in             General Electric Co.       this year, and a recent drop in food distributor             Sysco Corp.       after             Amazon.com Inc.       announced its plan to buy             Whole Foods Market Inc.       The S&P 500 index, meanwhile, rose 9.3% through June and an index of activist funds tracked by HFR Inc. rose 4.2% in the same time frame.Trian says its presence helps companies grow their earnings and stock price more than average. Of the boards Mr. Peltz has joined, the companies have averaged annual returns that best the S&P 500 by 8.8 percentage points, Trian said in a presentation.Trian\u2019s willingness to work with companies in private has often led it to negotiate its way into the board instead of needing a fight. Since it started in 2005, it has only had two prior proxy fights\u2014with             H.J. Heinz Co.       and             DuPont Co.      \u2014and there were nearly 10 years between them.In 2006, it took a stake in Heinz and sought a seat on the ketchup giant\u2019s board. That led to a heated fight, an early example of a shareholder taking on an American icon that helped open the floodgates of activism. Trian won two seats on that board, including one for Mr. Peltz. Afterward, the sides grew close and Heinz CEO William Johnson was put on the board of             PepsiCo Inc.       by Trian.The victory worked as something of a stamp of legitimacy for nearly a decade: Trian would go on to take big stakes, and companies, including             Bank of New York Mellon Corp.       and Ingersoll-Rand PLC, would often quickly assent to giving the firm a board seat.At Bank of New York Mellon, Trian co-founder       Ed Garden       joined the board in 2014, one of the few activists to join a heavily regulated bank. The sides have publicly lauded each other and worked together to cut costs, and the stock has returned 38% since Mr. Garden joined the board, in line with the KBW Bank Index. Monday, the bank named a new chief executive, Charles Scharf.In 2015, Trian ran a fight against DuPont. At the time, a win by Trian would have made DuPont the largest company ever to lose a shareholder vote, but it waged a successful countercampaign. DuPont argued Trian would be \u201cshadow management\u201d in the boardroom and said it didn\u2019t need Trian because its board had proven it was willing to make changes on its own.Though Trian lost that fight, the vote was close enough that if any single large investor had flipped it would have won a seat. And within months, DuPont missed on its quarterly results, changed its CEO and opened back up to Trian helping it structure its pending merger with             Dow Chemical Co.P&G seems ready to make a similar case to DuPont\u2019s: CEO       David Taylor       only started in November 2015 and has been moving to turn the gigantic organization. The board backs his plan and doesn\u2019t want to add Mr. Peltz because it doesn\u2019t see the need, people familiar with the matter said. The board also rejected Trian\u2019s concerns Mr. Taylor wouldn\u2019t deliver on pledged cost cuts, arguing the fear was based on prior management.\u2014Rob Copeland contributed to this article.Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Procter & Gamble\u2019s name was misspelled as Proctor & Gamble in a graphic that appeared with an earlier version of this article.

The games get increasingly difficult as the player\u2019s heart rate increases. To be able to resume playing without extra obstacles the child has to calm themselves down and reduce their heart rate.\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is build emotional strength for kids,\u201d said       Jason Kahn,        co-founder and chief scientific officer of Mighteor, a Boston-based company and spinoff of Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. BCH runs an accelerator and funded some of the research and development of the products. They retain a small piece of ownership of Mighteor. Dr. Kahn worked as a developmental psychologist at Boston Children\u2019s for seven years and maintains an affiliation there but launched the company in November.The games help children \u201cbuild muscle memory,\u201d he said. So once they are able to reduce their heart rate over and over again the response of physiologically calming themselves down becomes more automatic.Melissa Feldman,        a 39-year-old occupational therapist in Milton Mass., said she heard about the Mighteor videogames through a blog. She enrolled in a pilot group in September for her children, Carson, 10-years-old, and Quinn, 7-years-old, who have been diagnosed with anxiety disorders, among other conditions.The games have helped the boys stop and give pause when their emotions feel out of control, she said. \u201cI think being able to visualize that happening when they are breathing and seeing their heart rate come down and connecting that has really helped,\u201d she said.Ms. Feldman said she\u2019s also seen a lot of carry-over into real life. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it become a much more automatic response for them,\u201d she said.Her older son, Carson, agrees. He says the games have helped him remain calm in situations where he\u2019s upset, like when he misbehaves and can\u2019t swim in his pool.\u201cI think it\u2019s a fun way for kids to control their heart rate when their feelings are high and energetic,\u201d he said.Still, he said the games aren\u2019t quite as fun as the regular videogames he plays on his mother\u2019s computer and phone. \u201cThey\u2019re maybe three-quarters as fun,\u201d he said. His favorite videogame is still Minecraft.The impact of the games was tested in two studies.In a pilot study, they first tested the game in a psychiatric inpatient unit with children with anger management issues, said       Joseph Gonzalez-Heydrich,        director of the developmental neuropsychiatry clinic at Boston Children\u2019s. They found improvements in just five days and published the results in 2012 in a study in the journal Adolescent Psychiatry.\u201cA lot of these kids we are seeing are not interested in psychotherapy and talking,\u201d said Dr. Gonzalez-Heydrich, who is head of the scientific advisory board of Mighteor, and said he has a small amount of equity in the company. \u201cBut they will work really hard to get good at a videogame.\u201dIn a subsequent outpatient study the researchers randomized 20 youth to 10 cognitive behavior therapy sessions and videogame therapy that required them to control their heart rate, and 20 youth to CBT with the same videogame but not linked to heart rates. All the adolescents had anger or aggression problems, said Dr. Gonzalez-Heydrich, who was senior author of the study.Therapists interviewed the children\u2019s primary caregiver before and two weeks after their last therapy session. They found the children\u2019s ratings on aggression and opposition were reduced much more in the group that played the game with the built-in biofeedback. The ratings for anger went down about the same in both groups. The findings were presented at the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry conference in 2015. The study is currently under review for publication.Some doctors are skeptical that this type of biofeedback using videogames can work as a therapy.       Russell Barkley,        a clinical professor of psychiatry at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, noted that the studies looked at youth with high levels of anger, but not specifically with ADHD or anxiety, suggesting that further study as a therapy for anger control in particular may be warranted.The Mighteor games just became commercially available in June. Before that about 200 children had been participating in a pilot project.The company has about seven videogames available now and hope to have 50 in a year. Now, customers can buy a three-month, $249 subscription to the platform giving them access to all the games. The subscription includes a tablet and wristband that acts as a wireless heart monitor, as well as coaching sessions for parents. After that, the cost is $19 a month.Dr. Kahn said they recommend that children play the games 45 minutes a week. The product is geared toward children ages 6 to 14. Parents receive six coaching sessions from clinical social workers when they sign up.Kyle Smith,        a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Primary Children\u2019s Hospital in Salt Lake City, said last year he began using the videogames as part of the therapy used in an outpatient program for children with anxiety. The children come to the hospital three days a week, where they attend cognitive behavioral therapy sessions.He incorporates the videogames but the feedback is variable he said. \u201cCertain kids really seem to take to it quite well and it\u2019s motivating for them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s other kids who have a harder time. If they have motor coordination difficulty or sensory problems it can be a little tougher.\u201dWrite to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'When Videogames Can Help.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 16:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-children-can-benefit-from-playing-videogames-1500321670", "news_title": "When Children Can Benefit From Playing Videogames", "keywords": "adhd,anxiety,attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,biofeedback,childhood anxiety,children videogames,consumer tech: videogames,neurofeedbak,neurodevelopmental disorders,political,general news,demographic health,health,infant,child,teenage health,medical conditions,mental disorders,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,consumer goods,computing,games software,leisure,travel goods,technology"}, {"content": "Oil prices reversed gains on Monday, as investors weighed signs of strong demand against a global glut that\u2019s proven difficult to reduce.Light, sweet crude for August delivery settled down 52 cents, or 1.1%, at $46.02 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, breaking a five-day winning streak after trading as high as $46.68 earlier in the session.

Both offerings are fully backstopped, court papers say.Lawyers for 21st Century Oncology say approval of the two rights offerings is \u201ccritical\u201d to the success of its restructuring. Court papers peg the total cash raised from the offerings at $275 million, which will be used to help repay the company\u2019s debts and to send \u201ca clear \u2018business as usual\u2019 message to patients, physicians, vendors, and employees.\u201dLenders had already offered up a separate $75 million lifeline to ensure 21st Century Oncology\u2019s cancer treatment centers keep their doors open during its bankruptcy. The company operates 144 centers in the U.S. and 36 centers in Latin America.A hearing on the rights offerings, which require a bankruptcy judge\u2019s signature, is slated for Aug 4.Based in Fort Myers, Fla., 21st Century Oncology provides a wide range of cancer treatment services, employing more than 3,600 people.The company filed for bankruptcy with a widely supported preliminary agreement with key lenders that, if approved by Judge Robert Drain, will trim its debt-laden balance sheet. The pact, reached after months of negotiations, would trim the company\u2019s $1.14 billion in total liabilities by more than $500 million, court papers show.The company says broad changes in the health care industry have cut revenues and insurance reimbursements. 21st Century Oncology treats between 3,000 and 3,200 patients a day.A spate of government penalties and settlements have also hurt the cancer-treatment business. In March 2016, 21st Century Oncology agreed to pay $35 million to U.S. regulators to settle allegations of fraudulent Medicare billing practices, on top of an earlier $19.75 million settlement.Private-equity firm Vestar Capital Partners bought 21st Century Oncology, formerly known as Radiation Therapy Services Holdings Inc., for $1.1 billion in 2008.

Flexport is adding a physical footprint in an attempt to crack the roughly $400 billion freight-forwarding market. Analysts say the warehouses will allow the company to offer a wider range of services like a traditional forwarder, a key hurdle for the firm to gain market share.Flexport\u2019s software allows shippers to arrange transportation, clear customs and arrange other services via a website, which the company says it can do faster and cheaper than established forwarders performing the same tasks by phone or email. The 100,000-square-foot facility in Buena Park, Calif., along with others planned in Hong Kong and mainland China, will allow Flexport to handle customers\u2019 cargo directly.Flexport is among the biggest of a group of startups attempting to digitize various aspects of logistics, including booking transportation and finding warehouse space. The biggest forwarders, including             Deutsche Post AG\u2019s       DHL and Keuhne + Nagel, are working on technology of their own, however. They also own warehouses and other physical assets around the world that provide storage and speed the movement of cargo through ports and onto the next legs of their journeys. Startups like Flexport account for less than 5% of the market.\u201cIt\u2019s a logical step for [Flexport] as well as for any other startups looking to disrupt this market,\u2019\u201d said Cathy Roberson, a shipping industry analyst. \u201cRight now a lot of those startups are nothing more but marketplaces where all you can do is compare rates, book freight, manage documents and so on.

Each month, Flexport moves about 7,000 20-foot-equivalent units, a standard measure for container cargo, on ocean vessels. Top global freight forwarders handle millions of containers a year, but the market is fragmented.Flexport is also opening offices soon in Atlanta, where sales and operations staff will assist the company\u2019s small and medium-size customers. Depending on the success of the California, Hong Kong and Shenzhen warehouses, Flexport might look to open another warehouse near the Atlanta airport within the next year or so, Mr. Petersen said.Corrections & Amplifications   Flexport moves about 7,000 20-foot-equivalent units each month.

But       Emmanual Macron,        gauging most of the allies\u2019 perception of       Donald Trump       as an unwise and untruthful president, concluded he could use a hand. Hence, Mr. Macron\u2019s leap into calling Mr. Trump a friend.The French president\u2019s main mission in inviting Mr. Trump to Paris for two days\u2014emphasizing France military pre-eminence in Europe and the breadth of its forces\u2019 cooperation with the U.S.\u2014was clear. Mr. Trump brought along the chief of the CIA, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and his own national security advisor to the only country besides the U.S. leading a NATO battle group at Russia\u2019s borders and dispatching special forces to Syria.Mr. Trump won an honest admission from the French president when Mr. Macron said the day before the Bastille Day military show, \u201cWe need the United States\u201d\u2014and then, more adventurously, \u201cNothing will ever separate us.\u201d Mr. Trump spoke in turn of a bond of \u201cunbreakable friendship with France,\u201d adding, with Mr. Macron at his side, \u201cand ourselves.\u201dHere was the payoff to an exercise conceived by Mr. Macron for France to become the go-to guy for America in Europe. Contrast this to Mr. Trump\u2019s strained relations with Germany. Although the sight of the presidents\u2019 comfortable body language or Mr. Macron\u2019s guiding hand placed on his guest\u2019s back may have sickened Mr. Trump\u2019s American and European opponents, it escaped the stench of diplomatic dissembling.Mr. Macron avoided any reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s deepening problem with accusations of collusion with Russia. On the administration\u2019s rejection of the Paris accord on climate control, Mr. Macron said he both \u201crespected\u201d and understood Mr. Trump\u2019s decision.Indeed, he made the respect factor a point of differentiation between his approach and that of Chancellor       Angela Merkel       to Mr. Trump. As described by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the chancellor\u2019s rhetoric in the wake of the G-20 summit in Hamburg \u201cproclaimed Europe\u2019s emancipation from America.\u201d Over the weekend, the German newspaper defended Mr. Macron as a realist.A key motivation for that realism: Mr. Macron\u2019s need to fend off characterizations that Germany is France\u2019s parole officer inside the EU. Berlin\u2019s perceived role is pronouncing whether the French achieve the economic reforms needed to regain the status of a stable leader in Europe.In preparing for Mr. Trump\u2019s visit, Mr. Macron reiterated that Germany currently doesn\u2019t have France\u2019s military \u201ccapacity for intervention\u201d\u2014nor, he might have added, its will to fight. And he pointed a finger at       Barack Obama\u2019s       indecisiveness for having emboldened       Vladimir Putin\u2019s       military adventures,Even before the first Trump-Macron meeting at the NATO summit in May, where Mrs. Merkel made no specific pledges, Mr. Macron had put out assurances, certain to please Mr. Trump, that France would fulfill the basic alliance goal of spending at least 2% of GDP on defense by the end of 2024.Beyond his agile opportunism in dealing with the American president\u2019s emotions, Mr. Macron also showed he thinks that he can play strategic matters both ways.The morning of Mr. Trump\u2019s arrival in Paris, he led a meeting of Mrs. Merkel and members of her government at the Elys\u00e9e Palace on the future of Europe. It produced a joint announcement of a new European combat aircraft. No stranger to Trump-style momentousness, Mr. Macron spoke of the decision as \u201ca profound revolution\u201d\u2014although Le Monde reported nothing suggests Germany was ready for such a project.There was also meticulously dosed silence from Mr. Macron. He had nothing to say when Mr. Trump mentioned the two having dealt with topics like Ukraine, and a U.S. energy program\u2014presumably in fracked natural gas, which, in the president\u2019s words last month, would \u201cunleash\u201d American energy \u201cdominance.\u201d More vigorous U.S. engagement in both areas would curtail French, German and Russian political influence and energy profits.Perhaps returning the French courtesy, Mr. Trump kept quiet about the shared French-American assessment that Germany\u2019s trade and current-account surpluses are internationally damaging. Mr. Macron has even called them \u201cuntenable.\u201dOnce Mr. Trump was out the door, Mr. Macron recalibrated his sense of the visit for the neighbors and home folks. \u201cIt was important to talk to him to avoid his construction of opportunistic alliances with other nations,\u201d he said on Sunday. Russia, Saudi Arabia, Costa Rica? No answer offered.We have now observed Mr. Macron, president of France for little more than two months, as a master juggler.

It\u2019s also an opportunity for the European Union to finally recognize a terrorist organization for what it really is.The attack on July 18, 2012, in the seaside city of Burgas left five Jewish-Israeli tourists and their Bulgarian-Muslim bus driver dead and another 32 Israelis wounded. An investigation by Bulgaria\u2019s interior ministry traced a printer, used to produce fake documents for the bombing suspects, back to Hezbollah.The two men on trial for the attack, Lebanese-Australian Meliad Farah and Lebanese-Canadian Hassan       El Hajj Hassan,        are allegedly members of Unit 910. This is the unit that coordinates Hezbollah\u2019s terrorist activities outside of Lebanon. A third Hezbollah attacker, Lebanese-French national       Mohamad Hassan El-Husseini,        allegedly brought the bomb onto the bus and was killed in the blast.The Burgas trial is an opportunity for the court to demonstrate it can hold Hezbollah accountable. In recent years it has faced resistance from within its own government as well as other European countries, such as Finland, Ireland and Sweden. The defendants are to be tried in absentia because the Lebanese government has refused to extradite the suspects. And the case has already been postponed five times due to changes in Bulgaria\u2019s government as well as the complexities involved in collecting testimony and evidence from more than 30 victims. Bulgaria\u2019s justice system needs to make this antiterror trial a priority.In a rare sign of the growing seriousness with which the international community is watching this case, last year the European Union placed Messrs. Farah and Hassan on its terrorism list, subjecting them to asset freezes, among other measures. The U.S. did the same a year earlier.The EU has also designated as a terrorist entity what it refers to as Hezbollah\u2019s \u201cmilitary wing.\u201d It did so in 2013, shortly after the Burgas attack.But the EU needs to do more and recognize, as Hezbollah does, that the organization isn\u2019t bifurcated into political and military wings. Indeed, it should heed the call of the U.S. Congress, which, since 2012 and as recently as 2016, called on the EU to designate all of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. The U.S. has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization since 1997. It also sanctioned three leaders of the group in 2015 in connection to Hezbollah\u2019s military support of       Bashar Assad       in the Syrian war.Hezbollah\u2019s terror-financing activities and its critical role in the Syrian war should be enough for the EU to deport Hezbollah members from its 28 member countries. Anything short of full designation would enable Hezbollah to continue fundraising and operating its front companies. Last year, for instance, according to the German magazine Der Spiegel, German authorities uncovered a money-laundering operation in Europe that amassed nearly \u20ac1 million ($1.1 million) a week for more than two years, money that Europol and the U.S. Treasury Department says went to fund Hezbollah.Membership recruitment in Europe is also a significant tool for Hezbollah. According to a recent German intelligence report, there are 950 active Hezbollah members in Germany. This calls into question the effectiveness of the EU\u2019s 2013 sanctions, which were only imposed on Hezbollah\u2019s \u201cmilitary wing.\u201dHezbollah activity isn\u2019t new to Europe. In 2015, a Cypriot court sentenced Hezbollah operative       Hussein Bassam Abdallah       to six years in prison for amassing explosives to target Israelis. Two years earlier,       Taleb Yaacoub,        a Hezbollah member carrying both Lebanese and Swedish passports, was also convicted in Cyprus and sentenced to four years for plotting to murder Israelis. Yaacoub had conducted work for his Hezbollah handler in France and the Netherlands. Cyprus was reportedly used to stash the explosives to carry out the Burgas bus bombing.The EU might also take note of how the Arab world increasingly regards Hezbollah. In 2016, the six Gulf Cooperation Council states jointly declared Hezbollah a terrorist group. The Arab League followed suit a week later. Egypt labeled Hezbollah a terrorist group in 2009 after a Hezbollah plot was uncovered.Many of the EU\u2019s member states may already be drawing the conclusion that it\u2019s time to designate all of Hezbollah as a terrorist group. While individual countries may unilaterally do so, the EU as a whole would need to lower its requirement of unanimous consent.Should Europe maintain the status quo, however, it does so at its own peril. European security will continue to be put at risk. And Hezbollah will be given the signal that Europe is far from serious about countering terrorism.Mr. Weinthal is a research fellow at the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, where Ms. Dershowitz is senior vice president for government relations and strategy.", "news_time": "2017-07-17 15:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-eu-needs-to-get-tougher-on-hezbollah-1500319940", "news_title": "The EU Needs to Get Tougher on Hezbollah", "keywords": " bulgaria,european union, europol, hezbollah,syria, terrorism,European Union,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,terrorism,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Tel Aviv\u2018Capturing History: The Photography of Chim\u201d is part of Magnum Photo\u2019s 70th-anniversary celebration. In 1947, David \u201cChim\u201d Seymour,       Robert Capa,       Henri Cartier-Bresson       and       George Rodger       founded the cooperative agency; great photojournalists, they wanted independence to pursue only the projects that truly interested them. In an era when most people depended on newspaper and magazine illustrations for a sense of what personalities and events looked like, Magnum produced many of the most memorable images.Capturing History: The Photography of ChimMuseum of the Jewish People  Through Jan. 18, 2018Like Capa, Seymour (1911-1956) came to international prominence with his pictures from the Spanish Civil War. Capa\u2019s \u201cThe Falling Soldier\u201d (1936) established his reputation as a combat photographer. Similarly, Chim\u2019s \u201cWoman Nursing a Baby at a Land Reform Meeting Near Badajoz\u201d (1936) was widely circulated; the woman, seen from above, is straining to understand what is being said and its relevance to the baby at her breast. Chim\u2019s sympathy for her and her struggling apprehension informs the image; as always in his work, it is the face you remember.Chim was born and grew up in Warsaw, the son of secular Jews. His father\u2019s publishing company printed books in Yiddish and Hebrew; his mother edited a Jewish paper. After gymnasium, he earned a degree in graphic arts in Leipzig, Germany, and in 1932 left for further studies at the Sorbonne. In Paris, a job in a photo shop got him involved with photography, and he was soon selling pictures of political events such as \u201cFuneral Procession in Paris for Pacifist and Anti-Fascist       Henri Barbusse      \u201d (1935) to the press. His Polish name, Dawid Szymin, was difficult for non-Poles to pronounce, so he became \u201cChim.\u201d He photographed workers (\u201cLes Halles,\u201d 1936) and personalities (\u201cFrench Intellectual Andre Malraux,\u201d 1935), and established friendships with Capa and Cartier-Bresson.In Spain he documented civilians contending with the war. \u201cChildren Take Refuge in Underground Shelters on the Island of Minorca, Spain to Escape the Bombings\u201d (1938) shows them standing in an orderly formation in a small illuminated area surrounded by pitch darkness. Back in Paris he took \u201c      Pablo Picasso       in Front of His Painting \u2018Guernica\u2019\u201d on July 12, 1937, the first day the artist displayed his furious work. Chim was in Mexico photographing the arrival of refugees from the Spanish conflict when World War II began. He went to the U.S., anglicized his name to David Seymour, and joined the American Army; his work analyzing reconnaissance photographs earned him a Bronze Star. Chim\u2019s sister survived the war; his parents were murdered by the Nazis in Poland.Returning to Europe after the war, he photographed life in the ruins of the once great cities. The massive \u201cCrowd Listening to a Speech by Socialist Leader       Pietro Nenni      \u201d (1948) stands in the shell of the Basilica di Massenzio in Rome, while a single \u201cWoman in Her Garden Amid Ruins\u201d (1947) labors alone in Frankfurt. But the work that drew most on Chim\u2019s humanistic instincts was his photographs of children that were published as a book by Unesco in 1949. There were \u201cChildren Playing Among the Wreckage of the D-Day Invasion\u201d (1947) on the beach of Normandy; a girl in a body brace in the \u201cBellevue Hospital for Children\u201d (1948) in Vienna; children with missing limbs engage in a ball game in Rome; and, most famously, \u201cTereska, Who Was Raised in a Concentration Camp, Draws a Picture of \u2018Home\u2019\u201d (1948). On the blackboard behind her is a spaghetti-like squiggle, all she could draw, and on her face a look of incapacitating terror.The room that houses \u201cCapturing History\u201d is divided diagonally by an S-shaped line of large-format color prints of Israel suspended in glass frames. Chim had studied the use of color in Leipzig, and was quick to take advantage of Kodachrome when it became available. His bearded \u201cWelder\u201d (1954) is a heroic figure, clad in brown leather protective gear and standing in a huge pipe. The muscular \u201cWorkers at King Solomon\u2019s Mines\u201d (1952) in the Timna Valley are bronzed from exposure to the sun. Chim must have enjoyed the \u201cIndependence Day Parade in Tel Aviv\u201d (1952) that features a bright red tractor.Chim\u2019s last assignment was to cover the Sinai conflict in 1956 for Newsweek. As usual, \u201cInhabitants of Port Said After Anglo-French Air Attack\u201d shows his concern for civilians; a woman leads one child and carries another through the debris. On Nov. 10, four days after an armistice had been declared, he and French photographer       Jean Roy       headed in a jeep for El Quantara to photograph a prisoner exchange. An Egyptian machine-gunner opened fire on them, sending the jeep into a canal and killing both. Chim was 44.Henri Cartier-Bresson eulogized his longtime friend and Magnum business partner: \u201cChim picked up his camera the way a doctor takes his stethoscope out of his bag, applying his diagnosis to the condition of the heart.\u201d\u2014Mr. Meyers writes on photography for the Journal.

I have to go with my gut here.You\u2019ve probably seen or heard hype for this cuckoo summertime TV stunt: starting July 23, as part of its \u201cShark Week\u201d tradition, the Discovery channel will pit the all-time Olympic men\u2019s swimmer versus the magnificent beast of the sea. It\u2019s a bizarre gimmick that could only be cooked up in a room full of TV producers, or a sandbox full of juice-box-drunk 4-year-olds, which I guess is the same thing.It\u2019s so silly, but I kind of love it. Between Phelps vs. Shark, the inane Mayweather vs. McGregor fight, and the Home Run Derby being 600 times more exciting than baseball\u2019s dreary All-Star Game, it\u2019s shaping up to be the Summer of the Shameless Stunt.And there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little shamelessness in sports. What\u2019s to be so sacred about? Jesse Owens sprinted against horses. Cyclists chased speeding trains. The Jets play the Patriots twice a year.I\u2019ll admit that on paper, Phelps vs. Shark is a grotesque mismatch. The all-time gold medal leader has a stable case as our greatest waterborne human, but even at his Olympic peak, Phelps averaged only five or six miles per hour in the pool. Officials are letting him compete against the shark using a \u201cmonofin\u201d\u2014think state-of-the-art mermaid tail\u2014but even Phelps acknowledges the monofin is only going to add a few miles per hour more.A Great White, on the other hand, can easily hit 20 mph or more when it\u2019s in predatorial mode.Good grief. This thing is going to be a rout. Phelps is going to have to hope the shark has an off day. Maybe the shark falls down a staircase the night before. Maybe the shark stays out all night with Ryan Lochte.We don\u2019t know a lot about the parameters of this competition (which apparently\u2014spoiler alert\u2014has already been performed in South Africa). It isn\u2019t going to be the two of them side-by-side in an Olympic-sized pool, which is a little disappointing. Phelps did not force the Great White to swim the individual medley, which would have been phenomenal.We also don\u2019t know much about the shark opponent. Is it a young, aggressive shark? An older, more contemplative shark? Has the shark put on a few pounds? Why do I know 50 bazillion things about Lonzo Ball, who hasn\u2019t played a single NBA game, and absolutely nothing about the Great White Shark that Michael Phelps is going to swim against?What is the shark\u2019s name? Jerry? Eloise? Sally? Rufus? Mindy? Steve?Phelps recently gave an interview to Time magazine in which he talked about the competition\u2014and hinted it might be narrower than expected.\u201c[The monofin] helped make the race a bit closer,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the Great White bursts at the surface, that\u2019s their mechanism for obviously attacking and getting food, so that\u2019s not a normal speed that they swim at. [The scientists] were calculating the speed they could potentially swim in a straight line.\u201dOK. So he\u2019s throwing out a little intrigue there: the shark isn\u2019t going to be giving the Full Shark.Still, I am going with the Great White.I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s unsold on Phelps\u2019s chances. You can actually bet Phelps against the Shark on the online bookmaker Bovada. A $1,000 bet on the shark will net $100 in a shark victory. A hundred on Phelps will get you $550 if Phelps wins.

DIS 1.01%       has roped the entertainment giant into a long-running legal dispute over ownership rights to a visual-effects technology, potentially threatening the company\u2019s ability to profit from the top-grossing movie so far this year.Rearden LLC, a company controlled by Silicon Valley entrepreneur       Steve Perlman,        on Monday sued Disney in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, alleging copyright, patent and trademark infringement, stemming from Disney\u2019s use of a facial-capture technology in the March blockbuster \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d as well as 2014\u2019s \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d and 2015\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron.\u201dRearden is seeking injunctions to stop Disney from selling or showing these movies until the two companies reach a deal.The dispute centers on a technology called MOVA Contour. In \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d it was used to turn actor Dan Stevens\u2019s facial performance into that of the beast. In \u201cGuardians\u201d and \u201cAge of Ultron,\u201d it was used in the portrayal of the alien Thanos.The lawsuit alleges Disney knew, or should have known, that Rearden\u2014not Digital Domain, the visual-effects firm Disney paid for the work\u2014had sole rights to MOVA.Disney didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Since 2015, Rearden has been fighting in court against companies affiliated with Digital Domain over MOVA.Various studios have used the technology, with no resulting legal conflict, in films including \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\u201d \u201cGravity\u201d and Disney\u2019s \u201cTron: Legacy.\u201d Mr. Perlman has alleged a former employee stole the technology and unlawfully sold it to the Digital Domain-affiliated companies.In June, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing Digital Domain from continuing to use MOVA. A trial in the case was held in December, and a ruling is pending.Digital Domain declined to comment.MOVA was launched to much fanfare in 2006 by Mr. Perlman, a former             Apple Inc.       executive best known for selling WebTV to             Microsoft Corp.       in 1997. The system, which translates an actor\u2019s movements to a digital character, won a science and technology Academy Award in 2015.In the lawsuit filed Monday, Rearden alleges that Disney should have known the technology didn\u2019t belong to Digital Domain because in 2013, its movie studio considered acquiring the technology from the former employee. At the time, Rearden sent a letter stating that it owned the technology and Disney dropped out of the bidding as a result, according to testimony from the former employee. In addition, the lawsuit alleges, Disney previously contracted directly with Rearden to use MOVA on four films released between 2010 and 2012.\u201cDisney never bothered to contact its longtime MOVA Contour service provider Rearden LLC to ask any questions or to verify Disney\u2019s authorization to use the MOVA Contour system, methods, trade secrets or trademarks that Disney knew Rearden owned,\u201d the lawsuit states.In addition to the injunctions, Rearden is seeking orders to destroy all infringing copies of \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron\u201d and \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and is asking for financial damages.\u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d has grossed $1.26 billion globally. \u201cAge of Ultron\u201d raked in $1.4 billion world-wide, while \u201cGuardians\u201d grossed $773 million.Write to Ben Fritz at ben.fritz@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'Disney Sued Over Films\u2019 Visual Effects.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 15:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/disneys-beauty-and-the-beast-gets-entangled-in-visual-effects-lawsuit-1500318077", "news_title": "Disney\u2019s \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019 Gets Entangled in Visual-Effects Lawsuit ", "keywords": "beauty and the beast,business news,copyright news,disney,disney world,facial-capture technology,hollywood,mova contour,movie news,patent news,special effects,Walt Disney,DIS,Rearden,corporate crime,legal action,patents,copyright,corporate,industrial news,intellectual property rights,industrial property rights,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,broadcasting,cable broadcasting,media"}, {"content": "Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.        EQM&M 0.57%       plans to double its bets in the U.S. over the next five years, spending $1 billion in an effort to strengthen the Indian company\u2019s brand as President       Donald Trump       pressures companies foreign and domestic to steer investments toward America.\u201cWe believe in America,\u201d Chairman Anand Mahindra said Monday during a discussion with reporters and a separate interview with The Wall Street Journal in Midtown Manhattan. He played down Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric on trade, investment and immigration, pointing to encouraging business conditions in the U.S.\u201cFor the moment, the cycle seems to be very much in favor\u201d of a robust U.S. economy,       Mr. Mahindra       said. He added that he is \u201cnot the expert\u201d on whether attractive economic conditions resulted from previous Obama administration policies or the current White House.Mahindra\u2019s plan, which builds on $1 billion invested in the U.S. to date, would double the company\u2019s American employment to roughly 5,000 people, executives said. The Mumbai-based conglomerate, which executives refer to as a federation of independently run businesses, manufactures sport-utility vehicles and faces competition in its home market from established auto makers rushing to India.Its efforts are also small when stacked against established auto makers. In the U.S.,             Toyota Motor Corp.       plans to spend $10 billion over the next five years.While its auto sales are far smaller in the U.S., Mahindra is ramping up more, recently establishing an engineering center outside Detroit and a nearby factory expected to start building a utility vehicle in October.Mahindra is currently bidding to replace the U.S. Postal Service\u2019s fleet of delivery trucks. Winning that contract would significantly add to Mahindra\u2019s $1 billion investment plan in the U.S., executives said.Mahindra\u2019s U.S. presence is heavily tilted to established tractor and information-technology businesses, which will receive funds from the $1 billion investment alongside its North American automotive business and other ventures.Mr. Mahindra said tough immigration stances such as those Mr. Trump espouses \u201csometimes play out over a generation\u201d in terms of impacting business conditions.\u201cIn the long run, America should be cautious in not losing that advantage it has built up\u201d with immigrants contributing to startups and new technologies, he said. \u201cIn the short run, America remains a powerhouse of innovation.\u201dMr. Mahindra is turning some focus to electric cars. He pointed to \u201cstaggeringly low\u201d future prices he reviewed for batteries needed to power them that support the gasoline-engine alternatives taking a larger foothold in coming years. Manufacturers are investing billions of dollars in electric cars in part because of stringent future emissions regulations.Self-driving technology, meanwhile, is likely to take time but take hold more quickly in utility vehicles such as the company\u2019s tractors, he said.\u201cTesla\u2019s glamorous,\u201d Mr. Mahindra said, referring to the Silicon Valley electric-car maker that has pushed aggressively with autonomous-driving features in, for now, expensive vehicles. \u201cTractors will get autonomy first,\u201d he said.Mr. Mahindra doesn\u2019t expect the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord to significantly alter the company\u2019s emissions-curbing efforts.\u201cAmerica is not just Washington, D.C.,\u201d he said. State efforts will \u201cprevent it from getting off the climate change agenda.\u201dIndia\u2019s goal to sell only electric vehicles by 2030, meanwhile, is \u201caspirational\u201d but commendable, Mr. Mahindra said.

On Monday, officials said that applications would be accepted beginning Wednesday, and that 15,000 would be available.To qualify, employers must attest that their businesses are likely to suffer \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d defined as permanent and severe financial loss, without the H-2B workers.While some U.S. lawmakers sought even more visas, DHS officials said this amount would cover the number of companies that meet this criteria.Businesses seeking additional visas can expect to wait 30 to 60 days for the petitions to be approved, senior DHS officials said. The officials encouraged companies to seek \u201cpremium processing\u201d for their petitions, which costs about $1,200 but can shorten the wait time to about two weeks.Legislation authorizing the additional visas wasn\u2019t approved until the spring.\u201cWe understand that is late in the season,\u201d said David Lapan, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cWe\u2019re working as hard as we can.\u201dBy law, the number of H-2B visas, which are available for temporary, nonagricultural jobs, is capped at 66,000, divided between the summer and winter seasons. This year, the summer allotment was exhausted in March.In past years, Congress has exempted returning workers from the cap, enabling many additional foreigners to participate in the program, but lawmakers didn\u2019t renew that exception for this year. Instead, on April 30, Congress gave DHS authority to add additional visas if Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly found businesses that were at risk without them. It took DHS until now to use the authority granted.President       Donald Trump,        a Republican, built his presidential campaign on a promise to protect U.S. workers from foreign competition and regularly said U.S. interests are threatened by foreigners who come to the country both legally and illegally. As president, he has pushed a \u201cHire American\u201d agenda and suggested he may try to restrict existing visa programs. Still, his own Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., has used many H-2B workers for its winter season.In a nod to concerns about unfair competition from foreign workers, DHS said it was establishing a tip line for members of the public who want to report employers they suspect are abusing the program. People who want to submit reports can email ReportH2BAbuse@uscis.dhs.gov.Roy Beck, president of Numbers USA, an advocacy group that wants to restrict legal and illegal immigration, said he was disappointed in the decision.\u201cAt least Kelly limited the damage to keeping just 15,000 more Americans out of the labor market,\u201d he said. \u201cNonetheless, this is yet another example of the administration and Congress failing to keep the Trump campaign promise of putting American workers first.\u201dThe H-2B Workforce Coalition, which lobbied for additional visas, saw a mixed result, too. In a statement, the coalition said it is \u201cgrateful for the minimal relief granted.\u201d\u201cThough we fear this gesture may be too little too late for thousands of small businesses that rely on legal, highly vetted seasonal guest workers to meet their peak season needs, the additional visas may help save some small businesses this year,\u201d the coalition said.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Michael C.

PG 0.45%      , in an effort to jolt the consumer-products giant whose sales and profit growth stalled, Trian Fund\u00a0Management LP said.The move, first reported by The Wall Street Journal Monday, makes             P&G,        PG 0.45%       with a market value of $222 billion, the largest company ever to face a proxy fight. Should Mr. Peltz\u2019s Trian win,\u00a0which is far from guaranteed given how much support it must gain from other shareholders, it would mark a new milestone for a shareholder-activism movement that has shaken up some of the biggest U.S. companies in recent years.Trian, which owns roughly $3.3 billion of         P&G               stock, is seeking a single seat for Mr. Peltz in a shareholder vote at the company\u2019s annual meeting, likely in October.After nearly five months of discussions,         P&G               last week rejected a demand from Trian to name Mr. Peltz a director, Trian said, setting the stage for what could be months of public debate over how to get the maker of everything from Tide detergent and Gillette razors to Pampers diapers on a stronger growth trajectory.In a statement,         P&G               said: \u201cThe Board is confident that the changes being made are producing results, and expresses complete support for the Company\u2019s strategy, plans, and management.\u201dP&G\u2019s sales growth has been lackluster amid a sluggish global economy, pricing pressure and\u00a0competition from well-funded startups. It faced an earlier activist approach from       William Ackman       and has cycled through leaders as the stock price has lagged behind.P&G shares have underperformed the S&P 500 and the consumer-staples group for the past 10 years. They have returned about 4% to investors over the past 12 months, including dividends, compared with a 16% return for the S&P 500.Trian and P&G agree on some steps the company needs to take, such as cutting costs and restructuring management, and the investor supports Chief Executive       David Taylor       and the company\u2019s 11-person board. It isn\u2019t seeking a breakup as some analysts have speculated since the investment was disclosed in February.Trian has told P&G if it were to win a seat at the annual meeting, it would seek to renominate whoever lost, the firm said, expanding the board by the one seat.Still, Trian believes P&G has failed to move fast enough to arrest its market-share losses and convert cost cuts into profit, questioning the credibility of the company when it comes to carrying out promises.\u201cWe need a game-changing attitude at P&G,\u201d\u00a0Mr. Peltz said in an interview. \u201cWe just can\u2019t keep going along the same path,\u201d he said, adding that he sees the board as well-intentioned.Since Mr. Taylor took over in November 2015, P&G has moved to restructure management responsibilities, bring in outside talent, drop brands and cut some $10 billion in annual expenses by 2021. That is on top of the $10 billion the company says it already eliminated since 2012\u2014by cutting 24,000 jobs globally, shedding 14 factories and more than 100 brands to refocus on its most lucrative businesses.Yet sales and profit growth have remained elusive. The company reported earnings of $13.4 billion for its fiscal 2016, slightly less than the $13.8 billion it notched five years earlier. Organic sales growth, a closely watched metric that excludes acquisitions or divestments as well as currency swings, has been stuck between 1% and 3% in recent years, well below prerecession levels. In the March-ended quarter, organic sales rose just 1%.Mr. Taylor has said the company was failing to deliver and \u201cwe need to bring our standards up.\u201dTrian will need to garner widespread investor support to succeed. Even though the investment is its largest ever and the fifth-biggest P&G holding overall, it still amounts to only about 1.5% of the company\u2019s market value.Trian will have to convince investors that Mr. Peltz\u2019s experience\u2014and stock gains\u2014at consumer giants like         Mondelez International Inc.       and         H.J. Heinz Co.      \u2014qualify him for a board stacked with well-known business leaders.Those arguments didn\u2019t persuade P&G\u2019s board in private discussions. Over roughly half-a-dozen meetings and conversations, Trian laid out its concerns while P&G detailed its own views, but the sides didn\u2019t come to an agreement, Trian said.Last Tuesday, in a meeting with several directors and Mr. Peltz, P&G said it wouldn\u2019t give him a seat and that it wanted time to prove management could boost results, people familiar with the matter said. The board also refused to commit publicly to adding Mr. Peltz if the company missed its targets this year, they said.The activist is focused on the structure of P&G\u2019s leadership. Historically, there have been executives who run business units and others who are in control of sales and marketing, which Trian argues clouds who has ultimate responsibility for profits.Mr. Taylor has looked to address this concern already. Regional units have been handed more autonomy in bringing their products to market and executives say profit-and-loss responsibility now lies at the feet of category leaders.Trian also zeroed in on P&G\u2019s costs, questioning how a market powerhouse that commands prices far exceeding those of rivals, on average, doesn\u2019t have the best profit margins.P&G has increased operating profit margins, to 20.6% last year from 19.1% in 2011, and says it ranks third in the industry\u2014behind competitors that also charge high premiums. It has said the $10 billion it will cut by 2021 will come from reducing billions in spending on packaging, supply-chain costs and marketing.Trian says the previous $10 billion in cost cuts didn\u2019t translate into profit growth even after taking into account surging foreign-currency costs and it wants to ensure the current plan increases the bottom line.\u201cWe can\u2019t have what happened last time happen again,\u201d Trian co-founder and Chief Investment Officer       Ed Garden       said in an interview.\u2014Sharon Terlep  contributed to this article.Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   The graphic in a previous version of this story misspelled Procter & Gamble.Appeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Peltz Seeks P&G Board Seat.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 13:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trian-to-launch-proxy-fight-against-p-g-1500264242", "news_title": "Trian Launches Proxy Fight Against Procter & Gamble", "keywords": " activist investors, board of directors, nelson peltz,p&g, proxy fight,Procter & Gamble,PG,Trian Fund\u00a0Management,Nelson Peltz,Ed Garden,William Ackman,David Taylor,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,management,shareholder activism,corporate,industrial news,corporate governance,proxy fight,cosmetics,toiletries,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,consumer goods,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities,personal care products,appliances"}, {"content": "Google won\u2019t need to turn over an entire set of employee compensation data to federal auditors, dealing a setback to the Labor Department\u2019s effort to\u00a0prove the internet giant is underpaying women.An administrative law judge on Friday denied the federal government\u2019s\u00a0request for 19 years of pay data on 21,000 Google employees, ruling the inquiry is overly broad and intrusive of employee privacy.\u00a0The decision, which isn\u2019t yet final, could be a\u00a0partial\u00a0victory for the             Alphabet Inc.        GOOGL 0.59%       unit, which has resisted the agency\u2019s effort to investigate a possible gender pay gap in its workforce.The Labor Department sued Google for salary data earlier this year as part of a routine audit into whether Google complies with laws barring federal contractors from discriminating against employees. Labor Department official       Janette Wipper       testified in April than an initial review of 2015 Google data \u201cfound systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce.\u201dIn his recommended decision and ruling,       Steven B. Berlin,        an administrative judge in San Francisco, said the federal agency failed to offer credible evidence of any pay disparity in its request for data.\u00a0He did, however, ask Google to give the Labor Department a smaller set of pay data for up to 8,000 employees dating back to 2014. The government could appeal the decision.In a blog post Sunday, Google welcomed the judge\u2019s decision, saying its own analysis of its compensation practices doesn\u2019t reveal a gender pay gap.\u201cWhile we\u2019re pleased with Friday\u2019s recommended decision, we remain committed to treating, and paying, people fairly and without bias with regard to factors like gender or race,\u201d       Eileen Naughton,        the company\u2019s vice president of people operations, said in the post.The department can investigate Google because the company provides advertising and cloud services for the federal government.The Labor Department\u2019s regional solicitor for San Francisco,       Janet Herold,        said in an emailed statement the decision vindicates her office\u2019s \u201cvigorous enforcement of the disclosure and anti-discrimination obligations federal contractors voluntarily accept in exchange for taxpayer funds.\u201dThe agency will continue to investigate Google\u2019s pay practices and decide whether to bring charges against the company based on the data it has.Google also has denied requests from activist investors to disclose the percentage of female pay to male pay. Those investors, led by boutique investment firm Arjuna Capital, requested the same data last year from nine tech firms. Seven complied, including             Apple Inc.,Amazon.com\u00a0Inc.       and             Microsoft Corp.

Oracle, which declined to comment, has said previously that the complaint is based on false allegations and is without merit.In April, the department settled with data firm Palantir Technologies Inc. over allegations it discriminated against Asians when hiring.

Others, such as       Vincent van Gogh       or       Caravaggio,        are eponyms for extreme behavior. As the illuminating exhibition \u201cRichard Gerstl\u201d at the Ronald S. Lauder Neue Galerie makes clear, this pioneering Austrian modernist painter (1883-1908) should be acclaimed on both counts: for his daring, ahead-of-the-curve expressionist paintings and for his highly colored personal history. Yet though he is hailed by admirers as \u201cthe first Austrian Expressionist,\u201d Gerstl, unlike his celebrated compatriots       Gustave Klimt,       Egon Schiele       and       Oskar Kokoschka,        remains obscure on this side of the Atlantic.Richard GerstlRonald S. Lauder Neue Galerie  Through Sept. 25In part, this is because of the brevity of his working life, despite a precocious early start. (The exhibition\u2019s first harbinger of future directions is a semi-nude self-portrait painted around 1902-1904, before the artist was 21.) But Gerstl committed suicide soon after his 25th birthday, in the wake of a scandal, so there are few extant works, most of which are in Austrian collections. More important, because of the circumstances of his death, Gerstl\u2019s correct bourgeois family hid most of his art from view for more than 20 years; other works are believed lost. His first exhibition was not held until 1931, when his brother brought the surviving paintings to the attention of a prestigious Viennese gallery. The show was hailed as a revelation.Gerstl fans have long been tantalized by the Neue Galerie\u2019s energetic \u201cPortrait of a Man (Green Background),\u201d painted in 1908, the last summer of the artist\u2019s life, with its fluent, ribbony brushstrokes, casual pose, and summarily indicated outdoor setting. \u201cRichard Gerstl,\u201d organized by independent curator       Jill Lloyd       for the Neue Galerie, in partnership with the Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt, sets this fine picture in context and allows us to gauge some of the excitement generated by that 1931 exhibition. We follow Gerstl\u2019s evolution over a startlingly brief six years, from prodigiously gifted maker of naturalistic portraits to fearless creator of fiercely scrawled landscapes and figures so elusive that they verge on abstraction. Through the shifts in his approach, we can follow his discovery of artists such as Vincent van Gogh,       Ferdinand Hodler,       Edvard Munch       and perhaps       Edouard Vuillard.The exhibition\u2019s center gallery concentrates on portraits made between 1906 and 1908, the earliest constructed with large, rhythmic, broken marks, like over-scaled Impressionist touches, the latest with exuberant, uninhibited swipes and stabs of a loaded brush. Gerstl, we are told, can be seen as a bridge between Klimt and Kokoschka. Yet while his loosely patterned backgrounds may faintly echo Klimt\u2019s \u201cmosaic\u201d society portraits, the presence of one of the older artist\u2019s typically stylized, crisply delineated depictions of a woman in a fabulous hat emphasizes, by contrast, the greater freedom and sensuality of the younger man\u2019s paint handling. An agitated, rapidly scribbled Kokoschka portrait of a man underscores the prescience of Gerstl\u2019s approach.That pivotal early self-portrait, with the nude Gerstl swathed in a white sheet from the waist down, is on view in the first gallery. With its rough strokes, confrontational pose and symbolist overtones, it looks remarkably progressive for the first years of the 20th century, but it\u2019s completely overwhelmed by Gerstl\u2019s last\u20141908\u2014self-portrait, in the final room. A tour de force of slashing brushwork, pale flesh and full frontal nudity, it seems to show the painter at work, with the dark mass of his easel and large canvas an ominous vertical band that forces the figure to the left.A more ambiguous, minimally suggested standing nude, possibly in an interior with watchful witnesses, also from 1908, suggests that Gerstl, had he lived longer, might have painted figures as bold and economical as those of the marvelous Bay Area artist       David Park.       Light-struck, outdoor group portraits, with features and details of clothing implied by slashes and sweeps of sunny color, seem to bear witness to summer pleasures and a more relaxed mood, despite the urgency of Gerstl\u2019s brushwork.The subtext of the exhibition is Gerstl\u2019s close, complicated friendship with the composer       Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg,        his family, his musician colleagues and, above all, Sch\u00f6nberg\u2019s wife, Mathilde, with whom the painter had a brief, disastrous affair. Gerstl\u2019s portraits of these protagonists, executed with varying degrees of intensity, bring these connections to life. (That Gerstl\u2019s suicide was triggered by Sch\u00f6nberg\u2019s discovery of the couple in flagrante and the aftermath of that revelation was suppressed by the composer\u2019s circle until 1967; a carefully researched catalog essay by the Gerstl scholar Raymond Coffer clarifies the tragic story.)Some of Sch\u00f6nberg\u2019s own self-portraits and paintings are included, along with photographs and portraits by various artists of all the players in this highly charged drama. The most vivid is Gerstl\u2019s unfinished, life-size nude of Mathilde, painted in the autumn of 1908, before the affair was discovered and she returned to her husband. It was Gerstl\u2019s last painting.\u2014Ms. Wilkin is an independent curator and critic.", "news_time": "2017-07-17 13:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/richard-gerstl-review-the-first-austrian-expressionist-1500312013", "news_title": "\u2018Richard Gerstl\u2019 Review: The First Austrian Expressionist", "keywords": "arts in review, austrian art, neue galerie,richard gerstl,Richard Gerstl,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "The campus of Barber-Scotia College in Concord, N.C., has been on the market for five years.As long as it is for sale, other historically black schools that have borrowed through the U.S. Education Department\u2019s HBCU Capital Financing Program are responsible for paying down Barber-Scotia\u2019s past-due loan.Barber-Scotia took out a $7 million loan in 2000 to renovate a student-housing facility. The school lost its accreditation in 2004 after awarding a number of unearned degrees. With students cut off from federal financial-aid programs, enrollment plummeted to fewer than 100 from more than 700 in two years, according to local media and Education Department data.The school defaulted on its debt in 2005.Through a pooled escrow fund, into which borrower institutions deposit 5% of their total loan amount, other colleges have been picking up the tab. They have covered more than $5 million in Barber-Scotia payments, according to emailed responses from loan program director       Donald Watson.As of May 2015, the last time the federal program\u2019s advisory board met, members estimated that there was roughly $45 million remaining in the escrow account.\u201cAt some point, justice would demand other institutions not to pay to carry that burden, and I think that time may be coming to an end or may have ended some time ago,\u201d said       Norman Francis,        then-president of Xavier University of Louisiana, at a 2008 meeting of the program\u2019s advisory board.Minutes from advisory board meetings show that while Barber-Scotia\u2019s campus had been put up as collateral against the loan, officials didn\u2019t foreclose on it. And a decade after the default, the university continued to market it for sale.Many of the HBCU capital-financing loans are secured by mortgages on or revenue from campus buildings, including structures for which the funds are borrowed to build.Mr. Watson explained in 2012 that proceeds of the Barber-Scotia campus sale would first go to cover the remaining debt payments, and anything left over would refund schools whose escrow funds had been tapped.Barber-Scotia is still in default, and the campus hasn\u2019t been sold, the Education Department said.Rice Capital Access Program LLC, the Education Department\u2019s designated bonding authority, is \u201cseeking solutions to resolve the default in a manner that reimburses\u201d the escrow funds and protects the federal government\u2019s interests, said       Don Rice,        chief executive of parent company Rice Financial Products Co.The school has closed briefly a few times since it lost accreditation to reassess its strategy. It now enrolls about a dozen students, with a president working on a volunteer basis, according to       Marybeth Gasman,        professor of higher education and director of the Penn Center for Minority Serving Institutions at the University of Pennsylvania.Representatives from Barber-Scotia didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 13:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-school-defaults-a-for-sale-sign-goes-up-but-no-one-bites-1500311804", "news_title": "A School Defaults, a For-Sale Sign Goes Up, but No One Bites ", "keywords": "african-americans,barber-scotia college,colleges,education department,federal loan,historically black colleges,Barber-Scotia College,political,general news,education,politics,international relations,domestic politics,university,college,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014In the end, perhaps as it should have been, it was more of a coronation than a competition as       Roger Federer       dismantled Marin Cilic to win his 19th Grand Slam title with England\u2019s future king watching from Centre Court\u2019s royal box.Federer\u2019s 6-3, 6-1, 6-4 win, which came just three weeks before his 36th birthday, was arguably the most remarkable of his storied career. He didn\u2019t drop a set in seven matches. The dominating performance, gives him a second Slam title in 2017\u2014he won the Australian Open in January\u2014and comes at an age when most tennis players are in decline.Federer is ascendant. He has lost just two matches this year. He took control of Sunday\u2019s match in the fifth game of the first set and never looked back, winning nine of the next 11 games and 24 of the next 26 points on his serve to take an all-but-insurmountable two-set lead.The beatdown shattered not only a record but also Cilic\u2019s spirit. The Croatian was reduced to tears as his game fell apart in the second set and he battled through an aching foot he appeared to aggravate on a slip early in the match.With the victory, Federer surpassed Pete Sampras and became the only player of the modern era to win eight men\u2019s singles championships at the All England Club.\u201cMagical, really,\u201d was how Federer described his Wimbledon run.Even the sport\u2019s greatest champions can struggle with the game\u2019s inherent, and occasionally maddening, contradictions. Tennis requires a balance between exhausting bursts of energy and the moments of stillness between each point. It demands deep intensity but also a kind of Zen-state of relaxation. An elite player must constantly be aware of the parts of his game that are causing errors and mistakes, but be able to forget about each point the moment it\u2019s over because another is about to start.All of this, the speed, the power, the steeliness, even the ability to enjoy the most nerve-rattling moments, still seems to come so effortlessly to Federer. Of course it doesn\u2019t, and sensing his limitations Federer took off the clay court season to prepare for Wimbledon\u2019s grass, where he has had success that leaves even the game\u2019s top players in awe.A \u201csuperpower,\u201d is how the former champion Boris Becker describes Federer.\u201cThe most beautiful player I have ever seen,\u201d       John McEnroe       says.Tennis aficionados may one day indulge in a parlor game, trying to select Federer\u2019s best play of his fantastical Sunday.Was it tracking down Cilic\u2019s net-burning, angled touch shot that was already past him into the doubles\u2019 alley? He somehow cut it back into an undefended court.Maybe it was the sudden, backhand drop shot from the baseline that fell 3 feet from the net, and left Cilic so stunned he didn\u2019t even bother to try for it. Or perhaps it was the frozen-rope, cross-court backhand pass to earn his first set point of the afternoon? That shot was a scary reminder of how Federer this year has learned to attack with a shot he used to use largely for defense. Two points later, Cilic double-faulted to lose the set and to put himself in a hole he would never get the chance to dig himself out of.That is what Federer does. His artistry and his elegant, courtly manner cover up what an efficient killer he is, putting his foot on his opponent\u2019s throats once he has them down.After breaking Cilic\u2019s serve to take the first set, Federer started off the second one with an ace, one of four near-perfect serves that game. Three games in, Federer was up 3-0, and Cilic, seemingly in tears over his play and his nasty blister, called for the trainer to lend some medical advice that looked to be as much mental as it was physical.\u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt so much that it was putting me in tears, it was just that I couldn\u2019t do my best,\u201d Cilic said.He draped a towel over his head and tried to regroup. Federer strutted past him and pushed for the match to re-start. Here was a cold and simple message\u2014there will be no mercy today. If there were such a thing as a technical knockout in tennis, the umpire would have given Federer one on Sunday.Instead, ever the assassin, Federer finished off Cilic with an ace in just 101 minutes. He made just eight unforced errors all day compared with 23 for Cilic, who struggled in both his semifinal and the final to establish any rhythm on his backhand.Cilic, who is 6-foot-6 inches tall, can use his huge serve to attack points and try to win them. But Federer possesses an unending arsenal. He can out-slug, out-serve, or out-touch an opponent on any given day. Cilic may serve the ball harder, but there is no other part of his game that is better than Federer\u2019s.Beating Federer with all your strokes clicking is hard enough, and Cilic did it in the semifinal of the 2014 U.S. Open. Doing it with an injured foot, a suboptimal backhand and a shaky psyche is impossible.Saturday,       Venus Williams,        at the age of 37, tried to win one for the older crowd, but she ran into a 23-year-old buzz saw in Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza of Spain.No matter. Federer was waiting in the wings to pick up the thirtysomethings. Then he went out and played as well as he has in years, and, in his own way, won a tournament for the ages.\u201cI\u2019m incredibly surprised,\u201d Federer said of his success in 2017. \u201cYou would have laughed at me if I told you I was going to win two Slams this year. I also didn\u2019t believe I was going to win two.\u201dWrite to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Federer: A Tennis Assassin.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 12:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/roger-federer-wins-wimbledon-for-19th-grand-slam-title-1500217082", "news_title": "Roger Federer: A Tennis Assassin", "keywords": "fed,federer,federer wimbledon,marin cilic,roger,roger federer,swiss maestro,tennis,wimbledon,Roger Federer,political,general news,crime,legal action,murder,manslaughter,sports,routine general news"}, {"content": "Joe Maddon couldn\u2019t deny the awkwardness of the situation. Last week, he found himself in the dugout at Marlins Park managing the National League All-Stars, an honor he received by guiding the Chicago Cubs to a World Series title last year.But when he looked down the bench, he saw\u2026none of the players who made that happen, a strange truth that Maddon admitted left him feeling \u201cuncomfortable.\u201dFor the first time ever, nobody who played for the defending champions earned a spot on the All-Star team. Instead, the Cubs brought along Wade Davis, their new closer acquired in a December trade with the Kansas City Royals, as their lone, league-mandated representative.The conspicuous dearth of Cubs in Miami only highlighted the surprising nature of the first half they just endured. Expected to cruise back into October, the Cubs entered Monday\u2019s action 4 1/2 games behind the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Central and 5 1/2 games out of a wild-card spot.Rather than using the next 10 weeks to prepare for the playoffs, the Cubs\u2014the odds-on favorites two months ago\u2014must now attempt to climb back up the standings in a race nobody saw coming.\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to our second half,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cI have a strong belief system in our guys. I really do. I\u2019m not just saying that. It\u2019s not lip service.\u201dThe Cubs rewarded their skipper\u2019s faith this weekend, opening the second half by exploding for 27 runs in an impressive three-game sweep of the Orioles in Baltimore. Afterward, catcher Willson Contreras offered a bold prediction, declaring to reporters that the Cubs are \u201cback to where we were last year.\u201dBut in a season notable for a record pace of home runs, potential juggernauts in Los Angeles and Houston, and rookie outfielder Aaron Judge revealing himself as a real-life Terminator, the disappointing Cubs rank as baseball\u2019s most curious story line. Whispers about their struggles have reverberated across the sport in scouting circles and opposing clubhouses, with everybody wondering what has\u2014so far\u2014gone wrong in Wrigleyville.On the most basic level, it doesn\u2019t take an advanced degree in statistical analysis to understand the problem: Injuries and underperformance have resulted in the players who powered the Cubs to 103 wins in 2016 simply struggling to duplicate their production.Offensively, Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, Addison Russell, Willson Contreras, Albert Almora and Ben Zobrist have all seen their on-base-plus-slugging percentages drop from a year ago, in some cases dramatically. Burly outfielder Kyle Schwarber started so slowly that the Cubs briefly demoted him to Triple-A to reset.Their pitching has regressed even further. After leading the majors by a wide margin with a sparkling 3.15 ERA last season, that figure has risen by nearly a full run. (They took a step toward fixing that last week by sending four prospects to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for left-hander Jose Quintana, who threw seven shutout innings in his Cubs debut Sunday.)\u201cThere\u2019s no way that it doesn\u2019t even out,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey\u2019re way too talented. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see that inconsistency throughout the whole year. I think they\u2019ll be twice as good in the second half.\u201dCertainly, it stands to reason that the Cubs\u2019 young sluggers will bounce back. Bryant, the reigning NL MVP, has returned to form in July, while Rizzo hit .320 in June after posting a .194 batting average in May. Most of the time, good players in their primes ultimately put up numbers that match the back of their baseball cards.The Cubs\u2019 issues on the mound, however, present a serious challenge likely more difficult to overcome, one that points to an entirely new paradigm in baseball: Once a regular occurrence, teams don\u2019t win consecutive World Series anymore. It hasn\u2019t happened since the New York Yankees claimed their third straight ring in 2000, making this the longest stretch in MLB history without a repeat champion.No franchise better embodies this phenomenon than the San Francisco Giants. They won the World Series in 2010, 2012 and 2014. Each time, they failed to qualify for the postseason in the next year.\u201cThe competitive balance and parity has changed a lot,\u201d Giants general manager Bobby Evans said. \u201cThe way talent is distributed, the competitive balance taxes, free-agency compensation rules\u2014the parity is a huge issue, a huge factor.\u201dFor sure, MLB has taken tangible steps to ensure that small-market organizations can regularly contend with their richer counterparts. Expanding the postseason\u2014a crapshoot no matter the format\u2014has only increased the randomness. Additionally, players often cite a mental component, inducing a condition known as the \u201cWorld Series hangover.\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re World Series champions, it\u2019s all over the stadium, it\u2019s on your jerseys, the other team sees all that stuff,\u201d said third baseman Mike Moustakas, whose Royals won the World Series in 2015 before going 81-81 last season. \u201cThe other team plays a little harder. There\u2019s more expectation on you. Just being the World Series champs definitely adds a little bit more.\u201dBut ultimately, the real reason for the hangover probably comes down to pitching. Surviving through the World Series forces pitchers to log many more innings and change their off-season regimens. Most pitchers rest in October and begin a throwing program at the end of November. World Series pitchers rest in November and begin a throwing program in early December, ramping up with less rest than their peers. In an era where teams protect their pitchers the way mothers protect their babies, that matters.Jon Lester threw 35 2/3 innings last postseason and went into his outing in Atlanta on Monday sporting an uncharacteristic 4.25 ERA. Kyle Hendricks threw 25 1/3 extra innings, and he hasn\u2019t pitched in six weeks with a hand injury. Jake Arrieta and John Lackey have also pitched worse than last season. All told, the foursome of Lester, Arrieta, Hendricks and Lackey have a 4.45 ERA, up from 2.75 a year ago.Of course, nobody can say for sure that the additional workload has caused the decline\u2014but it couldn\u2019t have helped.\u201cThat can be an area that affects clubs, if the bullpen or starters get overextended,\u201d Evans said.Over the next two months, the Cubs could turn all of this into a moot point. The analytics website Baseball Prospectus still gives them a 40.7% chance of reaching the playoffs, while FanGraphs puts it at 67.7%\u2014a testament to their overwhelming on-paper talent (and perhaps a knock on the upstart Brewers).If the Cubs get there, their surprisingly slow start will fade away. But if they don\u2019t pick up the pace soon, there will be some angry people on the North Side. Cubs fans waited 108 years for a championship. They won\u2019t be quite so patient again.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an emotional part, and you\u2019ve got to push through it,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that this team will be fine with. It\u2019s too young and too talented and too smart.\u201dWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 12:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-the-cubs-wake-from-post-world-series-slumber-1500310332", "news_title": "Will the Cubs Wake From Post-World Series Slumber?", "keywords": "baseball,chicago cubs,cubbies,cubs,cubs world series,mlb,world series,Chicago Cubs,sports,routine general news"}, {"content": "The federal government has lent out nearly $2 billion over the past two decades to help dozens of historically black colleges and universities upgrade their campuses or refinance debt.But only a fraction of the money has been repaid, oversight is limited and the lifeline promised to the schools, which have played a key role in educating African-Americans since the Civil War, has become more of an albatross for some.Officials at Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, Ala., are lobbying the Education Department to have their $40 million loan modified or forgiven, arguing that the funds it got through the Historically Black College and University Capital Financing Program in 2012 were secured with overly optimistic enrollment projections.Barber-Scotia College in Concord, N.C., defaulted on its loan in 2005 after it lost its accreditation.And four schools ravaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which in 2007 took out a combined $361 million in loans capped at 1% interest over 30 years, have paid back just roughly $12.4 million of it in the past decade and were granted a five-year forbearance period in 2013 when enrollment didn\u2019t rebound quickly.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have much stricter underwriting requirements\u201d to ensure that schools can handle the new debt, said       Johnny C. Taylor Jr.      , president and chief executive of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, which represents publicly supported HBCUs, and a member of the loan program\u2019s federal advisory board.Created by Congress in 1992, the capital-financing program encouraged the colleges to participate \u201cas a coalition, as a collective, being willing to help other institutions,\u201d said       Brian Johnson,        who until last month was president of Tuskegee University. But as a pooled escrow system, the schools also were on the hook when institutions with questionable credit couldn\u2019t pay back their debt.The program got off to a slow start: By summer 2006, it had approved just $218 million in loans to 14 colleges. A Government Accountability Office report that year encouraged more aggressive marketing to potential borrower institutions. Over the next 10 years, the program approved $1.75 billion in loans, including 11 worth more than $50 million each.Many of the schools have used the funds to build or refurbish student housing and dining facilities, and they generated enough revenue to pay off the loan if enrollments remained stable or rose.LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis, Tenn., took out a $13.5 million loan in 2012 to finance a 336-bed dorm, doubling its capacity for residential students. The new dorm opened in fall 2013 and had an 86% occupancy rate this past fiscal year, according to spokeswoman       Daphne Thomas.       She said LeMoyne-Owen is \u201ccurrent and in good standing\u201d with its loan, though she declined to provide specifics about how much remains outstanding.But enrollment hasn\u2019t been growing at many of the schools in recent years, partly because the Education Department tightened borrowing requirements for a parent loan program popular at HBCUs. Historically black colleges enrolled 294,316 students in fall 2014, down from a peak of 326,614 in 2010.The program has long faced high delinquency rates.The Education Department\u2019s fiscal 2017 budget request shows that the program had a target delinquency rate of 14%. Its actual delinquency rate\u2014reflecting payments that were between 11 and 59 days late\u2014was 19% in fiscal 2012, and 36% in fiscal 2013. The budget paper doesn\u2019t include more recent figures for that performance metric.Donald Watson,        who has been director of the federal loan program for 10 years, said at a May 2015 advisory board meeting that there were schools on his \u201cwatch list\u201d because of concerns about impending financial trouble, and others that he described as \u201chabitual late payers.\u201dThe board hasn\u2019t met since then.\u201cA lot of this has been left without the oversight that we\u2019ve needed,\u201d said Rep.       Alma Adams       (D., N.C.), who co-sponsored a bill this year requiring more reporting by the advisory board and allowing the Education Department to provide financial counseling to schools that don\u2019t currently meet the loan program\u2019s requirements. \u201cThe schools that participate should be constantly assessed to determine whether they\u2019re on track for repayment.\u201dStillman hadn\u2019t been making regular payments for at least a year and a half before President       Cynthia Warrick       took the helm on an interim basis in January. She said she learned of the default two weeks into her tenure, when she received a message from the bank.Stillman used its loan funds in part to refinance a loan that was used to build a new football stadium; it gave up the sport in late 2015, eliminating ticket-sales revenue that could have helped cover debt payments.A fundraising appeal this spring allowed Stillman to make its April loan payment, but Dr. Warrick said the school would need to increase enrollment to at least 800, from its current 570, to afford another installment.Dr. Warrick said she has been in regular contact with Education Department officials and is hopeful that the repayment plan will be adjusted.\u201cIt\u2019s in the nation\u2019s best interest to either give us a deferral or, if they evaluate the entire program and all of these schools and what we do for the nation, that we should get a bailout just like the automobile industry and the banking industry,\u201d she said.Education Department spokeswoman       Liz Hill       said the department doesn\u2019t go into details about specific schools\u2019 finances, but noted that penalties are laid out in loan agreements and failure to repay can affect schools\u2019 accreditation and ability to borrow in the future.Ms. Hill said schools \u201cmust be creditworthy to access this program,\u201d and not every school that applies is approved.Morehouse College and Texas Southern University were rated as investment-grade by             Moody\u2019s Investors Service                   at the time they got their loans, but others were speculative bets.\u201cThe federal government needs to be a little more particular in their lending,\u201d said       Marybeth Gasman,        professor of higher education and director of the Penn Center for Minority Serving Institutions at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cYou should not be able to borrow anything unless you have a plan to pay it back.\u201dThe Education Department said there are eight HBCU loan applications now under review.Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'Black Colleges Struggle With Debt.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 12:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/loan-program-for-black-colleges-struggles-with-oversight-repayment-1500310260", "news_title": "Loan Program for Black Colleges Struggles With Oversight, Repayment", "keywords": "african-americans,alabama,black colleges,college debt,education department,federal loan,historically black colleges,morehouse,stillman,Morehouse College,Texas Southern University,Stillman College,political,general news,higher education costs,education,personal finance,university,college,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,building construction,school construction,construction,real estate"}, {"content": "Say what you need to say.Easier said than done, right?Difficult conversations come in many forms: \u201cShall we commit?\u201d \u201cI am worried about your health.\u201d \u201cYou hurt me.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t working.\u201d Communication researchers call them consequential unscripted Interactions because there are no rules or guidelines for them.

The receiver may not want to hear what we have to say.A study by researchers at Hope College, in Holland, Mich., and the University of Hawaii at Manoa, published in March in the journal Communication Quarterly, found that people are more reluctant to share bad news in a conversation when they are the cause of it\u2014and they worry more about how they come across in the conversation than sparing the other person\u2019s feelings.The researchers asked 330 people to answer questions about a time when they had to tell someone bad news, and then coded them for the reasons and concerns the person had for sharing, the source of the news and how reluctant they were to talk about it. People reported they worried more about themselves if they caused the bad news and more about the other person when they didn\u2019t.\u201cThis idea of \u2018don\u2019t shoot the messenger\u2019 was very active in their minds, especially when they were the locus of the event,\u201d says       Jayson Dibble,        an associate professor in the department of communication at Hope College and lead researcher on the study.Two more studies by Dr. Dibble and researchers at the University of Hawaii, published together in the journal Communication Research in March, 2015, found that people will pause in a tough conversation right before they have to deliver bad news.The researchers brought 275 people into the lab, told them they would be paired with another participant who had taken an IQ test, and that they would need to score this test and share the results with the test-taker. In reality, the test taker was an actor and a computer program produced false results\u2014some were high, some average, some very low. Some of the participants were given a script to use when delivering the news and some had to improvise. Script or not, the participants who had to tell the test taker that he or she had failed hesitated for a few seconds right before doing so. Participants who had to deliver good news, of a high score, didn\u2019t hesitate.\u201cIt might be a communication signal that you are meant to pick up on as a receiver, a way of firing a warning shot,\u201d says Dr. Dibble. \u201cI am giving you a chance to prepare yourself mentally for what is to come.\u201dMy dad had a sort of warning shot he used when I was a child and he wanted to have a serious talk: He\u2019d suggest we take a walk around our block, which was large and lined with oak trees and Victorian homes. On these walks, Dad told me I had to study more in Spanish class and bicker less with my sisters. But we also discussed how to get over the pain of an unrequited crush or handle our grief after Grandma died. I asked my father recently why he chose the walk-and-talk method and he said he felt that strolling side-by-side was less intimidating, as well as bonding, and that getting outside in a pretty setting made the conversation seem lighter.Don\u2019t rush into it. Conversations undertaken in the heat of a moment often don\u2019t go well. Invite your loved one to talk. Explain you want to have a vulnerable conversation and ask when it would be a good time to chat. Reassure the other person that the conversation isn\u2019t all bad. Researchers call this pre-talk meta-communication\u2014it is communication about communication, and it helps both parties prepare.Pay attention to your state of mind. Ditto for the other person. \u201cIf you know they are emotionally fragile or under a lot of duress you may want to consider a time where they are more relaxed and receptive,\u201d says Woody Woodward, an organizational psychologist in Jersey City, NJ.Start with a question. Try to learn where the other person stands, rather than make assumptions. \u201cYou may not like what you hear, but at least you can find some common ground on the actual issue in dispute,\u201d says Dr. Woodward.Listen compassionately. Focus on listening more than talking. To show your loved one you understand what he or she said, repeat it: I understand that you are upset because I said I need more space. Allow the other person to express emotion. Sentences such as, \u201cDon\u2019t feel sad,\u201d or \u201cYou are overreacting,\u201d should never come out of your mouth. \u201cWhat a person really needs is for you to validate their feelings,\u201d says Susan Kuczmarski, a cultural anthropologist, adjunct faculty member in the executive education program at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management and author of \u201cBecoming a Happy Family.\u201dGive recognition up front. Acknowledge the other person\u2019s strengths. Give a compliment. This will lower the emotional intensity of the discussion, says Dr. Kuczmarski.Be clear about your goals. What do you want to get out of the discussion? Write this down beforehand. Some people even like to take notes into the talk, to stay on track. \u201cIf you were talking to your boss or giving an important presentation, you would bring your notes,\u201d Dr. Dibble says. Use these to clearly state what you need from your loved one.Reframe the talk. View it as a chance to make your relationship better. It might be uncomfortable but it doesn\u2019t have to be negative. \u201cInstead of seeing the conversation as an obstacle and the other person as an opponent, see it as an opportunity to learn about each other and grow,\u201d says Dr. Dibble.Write to Elizabeth Bernstein at Bonds@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'This Conversation Doesn\u2019t... ...Have To Be So Hard How can you make tough talks a little easier?.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 12:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-navigate-difficult-conversations-1500310034", "news_title": "How to Navigate Difficult Conversations", "keywords": "conversations,difficult conversations,relationship trouble,tough talks,Hope College,political,general news,living,lifestyle,relationships"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The House Budget Committee will consider a fiscal 2018 budget resolution Wednesday, marking a crucial but still early step in Republicans\u2019 path to a major tax overhaul.A budget resolution approved by the House and Senate is necessary to trigger the so-called reconciliation rules that would let the GOP pass a subsequent tax bill through the Senate without Democratic votes.

As a U.S. Public Health Service nurse, I was stationed on a remote reservation on the Nevada-Idaho border. Attracting competent nurses and doctors was always a problem. We hired Rent-a-Docs when desperate and experienced competence problems along with cultural insensitivity.Doctors and nurses had to have state licenses, but ancillary staff didn\u2019t. Administrators, ambulance drivers, supply people and others needed to run a health-care facility were chosen under the Indian Preference Act. They often lacked the education and experience needed for their jobs. On more than one occasion, I went on an ambulance run only to run out of gas or to have no supplies to attend to the patient.The government has no business in health care whether it is the Indian Health Service (IHS), Veterans Affairs or ObamaCare.Deborah RingRadford, Va.Many IHS service units provide excellent, high-quality care despite underfunding, staffing shortages and isolation. My husband and many colleagues have devoted more than 25 years of their careers to serving on a remote reservation in Arizona. The hospital where they serve not only meets, but surpasses the minimum U.S. standards for medical facilities. If you compare the salaries they earn, you\u2019ll find that they make below the national average for family practitioners, pediatricians and internists. Partly because of this salary disparity, partly because of the bureaucratic application process and partly because of the isolation of the area, it is difficult to maintain a full staff of providers. When service units are forced to hire temporary locum tenens physicians in lieu of decreasing services, the quality of care can change dramatically. The practitioners who remain despite the hardships are beloved and valued within the Native American community. Please do not paint all IHS service units with the same brush.Laura B. Brown, M.D.Pinetop, Ariz.My experience as an IHS physician in the Zuni-Ramah Service Unit, which for a brief time had a medical-student program, suggests how medical-school affiliation with remote facilities could help improve the quality of care. If each failing hospital had a teleconferencing and resident rotation contract with a university medical school primary-care department, it would be possible for patients who met severity criteria to be reviewed via teleconference at the time of presentation. Patients could have their treatment reviewed immediately and, if needed, be transferred to the university. Primary-care residents rotating through the facility also could provide on-site review for patients. Each of the hospitals also could contract with the university\u2019s physician-assistant program for training and one- to two-year placement agreement for their graduates. This would provide another way to improve direct care.The costs of such an intervention could be spread across the health-care system in the Indian Health Service and from the government grants to university family practice, resident and physician-assistant training programs.Kim James Masters, M.D.Fairview, N.C.", "news_time": "2017-07-17 12:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tribes-lose-again-this-time-on-health-care-1500307917", "news_title": "Tribes Lose Again, This Time on Health Care", "keywords": "Indian Health Service,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,health care policy,political,general news,society,community,ethnic minorities,health,social issues,letters,routine general news,building construction,construction,real estate"}, {"content": "William McGurn suggests that we put pressure on Beijing by denying visas to some Chinese students at U.S. universities because they are children of the influential elite (\u201cHow to Squeeze China,\u201d Main Street, July 11).

BLK -0.10%       pulled in another $103.6 billion in the second quarter, further solidifying the largest trend in asset management where billions keep flooding into lower cost funds, often at the cost of money run by human stock and bond pickers.The net new money from investors was a quarterly record for the firm. Of the total, $73.8 billion flowed into its iShares exchange-traded fund unit.While the growing popularity of ETFs is helping many firms with significant lineups of passive investment strategies, BlackRock stands out among its peers. The firm\u2019s $1.5 trillion ETF business gives the world\u2019s largest asset manager a major competitive edge. Its assets have swelled to $5.69 trillion, up 16% from the same time last year while fund firms without large ETF franchises have struggled to gather assets.\u201cWe are seeing more and more active investors using ETFs for active management,\u201d Chief Executive       Laurence Fink       said in an interview.Those shifting preferences, however, mean lower fees and therefore revenue for fund providers. BlackRock\u2019s revenue rose 5.7% to $2.97 billion, while analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had projected $3.02 billion in revenue. The firm\u2019s stock closed down 3.1% Monday.Mr. Fink said changing regulations governing retail investing and advice globally were also helping BlackRock attract net new money. The Labor Department\u2019s fiduciary rule in the U.S. and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II in Europe are reshaping investor portfolios and shifting more assets away from traditional portfolios run by humans and into so-called model portfolios that include a number of lower-cost ETFs.\u201cI do believe the changes in the ecosystem in retail are giving us accelerated flows,\u201d Mr. Fink said.More broadly, Mr. Fink said that despite political gridlock in Washington and tepid economic growth, global investors still think the U.S. is the best place to put money to work.\u201cIf you had a view that we were going to have rapid infrastructure and tax reform, those people probably are disappointed,\u201d Fink said. \u201cWe believe this will all take time,\u201d he said.The growth of passive funds has increased fee pressure and forced asset managers to better control costs. As BlackRock has grown its iShares ETF unit, it has looked for new ways to use technology to save money and generate additional revenue.Its Aladdin risk and portfolio management technology system, which the firm has invested heavily in in recent years, is now used by money managers, custodians, risk managers and wealth advisers. Mr. Fink said on a call with analysts Monday that the firm had also used Aladdin internally to significantly reduce its own trading costs.BlackRock\u2019s technology and risk management revenue grew 12% year-over-year. Still, at $164 million, the business makes up a small portion of the firm\u2019s overall revenue.In traditional actively managed products, flows turned positive compared with last quarter. During the second quarter, investors added $7.5 billion to the company\u2019s actively managed funds including retail fixed-income products and multiasset strategies for institutional investors.It continued to suffer net withdrawals from its active equity business. The firm is in the throes of a revamp of its stockpicking unit, a process that puts a greater emphasis on quantitative investing rather than traditional equity selection.\u201cIt\u2019s doing better than we feared,\u201d Mr. Fink said of the project, referred to internally as Monarch. Uncertainty and management changes have led some clients to withdraw assets, but the effort remains on track, he said.The firm posted a significant improvement in performance among its scientific active equity products, which are its quantitatively-managed equity strategies. Over one year to the end of June, 9% of assets in scientific active equity products underperformed their benchmark or peers, compared with 60% at the same time last year. Over three years to the end of June, 8% of assets in those strategies underperformed, compared with 18% at the same time last year.In all, BlackRock reported a profit of $857 million, or $5.22 a share, in its second quarter, up from $789 million, or $4.73 a share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, BlackRock earned an adjusted $5.24 a share, up from $4.78 in the year prior.

But even as the restructuring process devolves into more lawsuits, defaults, and downgrades, some ripple effects are creating surprising opportunities for investors.Consider what\u2019s going on with             MBIA                   the parent of bond insurer National, which insures about $4 billion in par value of Puerto Rico bonds. (That\u2019s about $8.5 billion in total debt exposure, including all scheduled interest payments and principal.) MBIA\u2019s business plans were torpedoed by a two-notch rating downgrade by S&P Global Ratings in late June. The firm laid off employees and said it would give up trying to write new business, as bond insurers have to be rated higher than municipalities for the insurance to add any value.Yet, MBIA\u2019s shares have been rising ever since. On Tuesday, management told investors to expect shareholder-friendly moves, such as more stock buybacks and perhaps a special dividend\u2014even as it had to increase accounting for losses related to Puerto Rico. Executives say the firm, which has the ability to pay claims equal to $4.6 billion, is now \u201cunshackled from most of the limitations imposed by the rating agencies,\u201d by not writing new business. The stock has risen to $10 from $8 in the past two months.Investors expect MBIA to be acquired by fellow bond insurer Assured Guaranty. Deal speculation has fueled the gains. CreditSights analyst Josh Esterov thinks it will be challenging for the two companies to reach a deal, but calls the logic behind it \u201csound.\u201dSuch special situations aren\u2019t normally the purview of municipal-bond investors. But the bonds insured by MBIA and Assured may be. Richard Daskin of RSD Advisors believes that investing in insured Puerto Rico paper can be a good opportunity, even though he qualifies that it \u201cshould probably be done with professional help.\u201dMark Taylor, portfolio co-manager of the Alpine High Yield Managed Duration Municipal fund, has recently added to his fund\u2019s stake in insured Puerto Rico munis, raising his allocation to 6% from about 5%. He won\u2019t touch uninsured Puerto Rico paper, and he keeps maturities to within five years. For example, he owns some general-obligation bonds maturing in 2020 that now yield 3%, equivalent to a 5% taxable yield for investors in a high tax bracket.Mr. Taylor was surprised by MBIA\u2019s downgrade, which he calls \u201cdraconian.\u201d He believes the firm has adequate reserves for at least the next several years. Plus, if MBIA is sold, the bonds it insures would climb in price, he says.Other muni-fund managers are avoiding Puerto Rico bonds altogether. \u201cI think the ultimate outcomes will be significantly worse than where the bonds are trading now,\u201d says Nicholos Venditti of Thornburg Investment Management. While Puerto Rico\u2019s GO bonds are trading at about 60 cents on the dollar, he believes they could ultimately be worth as little as 25 cents. And if Assured, which has higher reserves than MBIA does, has to pay out large amounts in claims, it could get downgraded.\u201cThese entities live and die by their credit ratings,\u201d Mr. Venditti says. Yet if bond insurers get through Puerto Rico\u2019s restructuring, pay all their claims, and don\u2019t get downgraded, they could have a great sales pitch to boost their business, he notes.Puerto Rico\u2019s road to restructuring is going worse than expected for creditors so far. \u201cThe judge is the one picking winners and losers, and that isn\u2019t a good place to be,\u201d says Mr. Taylor.

After hearing the band, Mr. Ezrin decided instead to work with them on their next album.Within months, Alice Cooper recorded and released \u201cEighteen.\u201d The hard-rock single about teenage uncertainty and self-doubt was Alice Cooper\u2019s first hit, reaching #21 on Billboard\u2019s pop chart. The band would go on to pioneer theatrical shock rock.Recently, lead singer Alice Cooper, guitarist Michael Bruce, bassist Dennis Dunaway, manager Shep Gordon and producer Bob Ezrin talked about the song\u2019s evolution. Currently touring, Alice Cooper will release \u201cParanormal\u201d (earMusic) July 28. Edited from interviews.Alice Cooper: After our first two albums came out in 1969 and early \u201970, they bombed. We lived in Los Angeles then and were running out of cash. We never considered quitting, but we started to worry. Shep Gordon, our manager, suggested we relocate to the Midwest, where we had a larger fan base.Michael Bruce: Touring in the Midwest in early \u201970, we stayed at motels. During our down time, I came up with songs on my guitar. One of them was called \u201cI Wish I Was 18 Again.\u201d I hadn\u2019t been home in a couple of years and I missed Phoenix.I had the song\u2019s three-chord riff\u2014E minor, C major and D major\u2014but my lyric was a little silly (he sings): \u201cBe my high school girl / be the only one / I wish I was 18 again.\u201d I knew that wasn\u2019t going to last (laughs).I used the song to warm up in dressing rooms before shows. Eventually the band began using my riff as an eight-minute sound-check jam.Dennis Dunaway: In the early spring of \u201970, we were in New York to shoot our performance scenes for \u201cDiary of a Mad Housewife.\u201d At the Gorham Hotel, I looked across West 55th St. at the City Center theater. All the posters outside were for the Joffrey Ballet\u2019s spring season.On the poster was a scary white-faced clown with thick makeup around his eyes and squiggly lines coming out like spokes.I told Alice he should do his eyes that way. At first he wasn\u2019t into it but he was open. We bought eyeliner at a nearby cosmetics store and applied it at the hotel. That was the start of Alice\u2019s spider eyes.Mr. Bruce: Back in the Midwest, the band wanted to start performing our sound-check jam for audiences. But my original lyric was too cumbersome. Alice rewrote it.Mr. Cooper: My lyric was about coming of age, confusion and frustration. It became an angst song, like The Who\u2019s \u201cMy Generation.\u201d In some ways it\u2019s bleak: \u201cI got a baby\u2019s brain and an old man\u2019s heart / Took eighteen years to get this far.\u201dWhen I wrote the lyric, I was 22, so I had to think back to what it was like to turn 18: \u201cDon\u2019t always know what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about / Feels like I\u2019m livin\u2019 in the middle of doubt.\u201dBy then, we needed a place to live and to rehearse 24/7. Our road manager, Leo Fenn, found us a ranch just outside Pontiac, Mich., about 45 minutes north of Detroit.Mr. Bruce: The place had a four-bedroom farmhouse with a kitchen and an empty barn out back. Behind that was an indoor horse paddock, with a large enclosed room that was perfect for rehearsing.Shep Gordon: The band just needed a smart record producer. The Guess Who was a Canadian hard-rock band with hits like \u201cNo Time\u201d and \u201cAmerican Woman\u201d on the pop charts. The guy who produced their records was Jack Richardson. I went up to Toronto to see him.Bob Ezrin: Jack didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with Alice Cooper. He didn\u2019t like their albums. To keep Shep happy, though, Jack told me to go to New York to hear the band at Max\u2019s Kansas City and let them down easy.In early September of \u201870, I sat down at a table right in front of the stage at Max\u2019s Kansas City waiting for Alice to come on. Everyone in the place had spider eyes painted on like Alice.At times, the music was powerful, what people called hard rock then. At other times it was whimsical and focused on theatrics. I loved it.After, I went upstairs and bounded into their dressing room. I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to produce your next album.\u201d I also said their song, \u201cI\u2019m Edgy,\u201d could be a hit. Drummer Neal Smith said Alice was actually singing, \u201cI\u2019m eighteen.\u201dWhen I finally left at 3 a.m., I realized Jack was going to fire me for committing to produce a band he wanted me to blow off.In the morning, when I called him, Jack wasn\u2019t happy. But he said, \u201cIf you like the band that much, you produce them.\u201dJack wanted me to start by recording just four songs. I went up to the band\u2019s Pontiac ranch to get the music in shape, what we call pre-production. The first song we tackled was \u201cEighteen.\u201dFirst I had them play the original version the way they performed it on stage. There was a long introduction. I stopped them and said we had to get to the vocal much faster.I compressed the intro to just the three-chord riff. Then I had Glen Buxton play a lead guitar solo that flew into Alice\u2019s first verse: \u201cLines form on my face and hands/ Lines form from the ups and downs.\u201dThe biggest problem with the rest, though, was that everyone played all the time. The music had to be stripped down to just bass and drums with the vocal then built back up.Mr. Cooper: Bob was brilliant. He kept telling us to dumb it down so we could shorten it. He wanted the listener to get it immediately.Mr. Ezrin: At first there was pushback, but Alice was an advocate. He heard the results instantly. What I wanted from the band required a lot of practice. We routined it over and over until they got it right. Then we edited Alice\u2019s lyric to fit the tighter arrangement.Mr. Cooper: We had been intent on being the Yardbirds and showing off our guitars. Bob said absolutely not. Glen Buxton\u2019s lead guitar needed to come at the right time and then drop out.The guitar couldn\u2019t interfere with the melody line or bass and drums. Bob stripped us down to what the Beatles had done. Bob was our George Martin.Mr. Ezrin: After we had \u201cEighteen\u201d set, the band played it live at a Detroit gig. The audience went nuts.Mr. Cooper: In the fall, we recorded \u201cEighteen\u201d and three other songs at RCA\u2019s Mid-American Recording Center in Chicago. Elvis had recorded there.Mr. Bruce: We recorded in street clothes. Makeup was strictly a stage thing. I played my Gibson SG guitar. I have the hands of a boxer, so I don\u2019t have super-long fingers. That Gibson\u2019s frets were an easier target to hit playing rhythm.Mr. Dunaway: I played a Gibson EB-0 bass. Jack Richardson was there by then. At some point he turned over a metal ashtray and taped it to the console. Then he tapped the beat on the tray with a drumstick like a metronome so we\u2019d hear it in our headphones. It kept us from speeding up.Mr. Bruce: When Alice added his lead vocal to the instrumental track, Bob cleared the studio. He wanted an environment that would allow Alice to get into character emotionally while singing.Mr. Ezrin: What most people don\u2019t know about the recording is that it\u2019s the product of multiple takes spliced together. Jack was an editing master and did the cuts.Mr. Bruce: When the single came out in November, Shep had everyone constantly call radio station CKLW in Windsor, Canada, to request it. CKLW\u2019s signal reached into the Midwest.Mr. Ezrin: The Midwest was highly receptive to \u201cEighteen.\u201d Kids of assembly-line factory workers populated the region. By 1970, they began to see their dads with dead-end jobs and no prospects. This wasn\u2019t what they wanted to do. They wanted to matter.Mr. Bruce: As the single gained traction, we recorded our third album, \u201cLove It to Death,\u201d which was a hit after it came out in March \u201871. Inside the album\u2019s gatefold, fish-eye photos of the band were placed in Alice\u2019s eyes. If you look closely, you\u2019ll see us in our Pontiac rehearsal space.Mr. Cooper: Young rock artists were becoming a mirror of chaos. Our band was the frightening mirror, like the one that distorts at the fun house.But what we were doing had to have comedy. If you\u2019re singing about chaos and horror, you have to play it as tongue in cheek. Otherwise the shock overshadows the music.The last line of my lyric to \u201cEighteen\u201d was supposed to be \u201cI\u2019m 18 and I hate it.\u201d But as I neared the end of my vocal in the studio, I decided to flip it to \u201cI\u2019m 18 and I like it.\u201d I wanted to turn the teenage angst around.That was a surprise to everyone in the control booth. With my earlier lyric, the song was a good hard rocker. But by flipping the line, the song became a statement.Appeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'Alice Cooper\u2019s \u2018Eighteen\u2019.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 11:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-alice-cooper-wrote-its-first-hit-eighteen-1500306950", "news_title": "The Story Behind Alice Cooper\u2019s First Hit, \u2018Eighteen\u2019", "keywords": "political,general news,arts,entertainment,music"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014European Union foreign ministers swung largely behind Washington\u2019s stance on North Korea on Monday, threatening further sanctions and pressing China to push       Kim Jong Un\u2019s       regime to abandon its nuclear work.Yet behind\u00a0Monday\u2019s joint stance, European governments are staking out conflicting positions on one of the world\u2019s most volatile flashpoints.Despite recent EU overtures urging dialogue on the North Korean crisis, the ministers called on Pyongyang to move toward reducing its nuclear program as a precondition for broader international talks, even as South Korea\u2019s new left-leaning president pushed military-to-military contacts with the north to ease tensions.EU foreign-policy chief       Federica Mogherini,        with the backing of Sweden, Ireland and others, has been looking at how the EU could revive discussions to help avert conflict over North Korea. They argue that pressure alone is insufficient to stop Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear work.EU officials say Brussels may be considered a relatively neutral party by all sides, as 26 of its member states have formal diplomatic relations with Pyongyang and seven maintain embassies there. The EU has no formal role in the United Nations-backed six-party talks, which are charged with ending the nuclear standoff.Others EU countries, including large members such as Britain, France and Germany, are wary of allowing North Korea to use talks to divide the international community. They believe stepped-up pressure on Pyongyang and China, at least for now, is the best route back to serious discussions.Monday\u2019s\u00a0EU talks were held amid mounting tensions over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, following a string of missile tests in recent months that showed new capabilities. These included a test earlier this month of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could potentially reach parts of the U.S.South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Monday offered formal talks with Mr. Kim\u2019s regime. U.S. President       Donald Trump       meanwhile has upped pressure on Beijing and Pyongyang, threatening some \u201cpretty severe things\u201d in response to the Kim regime\u2019s missile tests. U.S. officials have said a military solution isn\u2019t off the table.The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the EU had reached out to senior South Korean and Chinese officials, saying it was willing to play some kind of broker role if it could help. Officials have insisted, however, they would only act at South Korea\u2019s request.\u201cWe will discuss with ministers what more we can do to facilitate a solution that, in our view, cannot be but a diplomatic and political one,\u201d Ms. Mogherini said ahead of Monday\u2019s\u00a0discussions.Speaking after the meeting, however, U.K. Foreign Secretary       Boris Johnson       said there were \u201csome tough words\u201d in Monday\u2019s discussions on North Korea, with London among those making clear this wasn\u2019t the time for diplomatic outreach.\u201cThere are some people who think we should engage early with Pyongyang. We absolutely disagree on that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to make a serious move towards denuclearizing their country before it is right for us to begin a proper dialogue.\u201dMonday\u2019s\u00a0ministerial statement referred to possible new EU \u201crestrictive measures\u201d including efforts to limit Pyongyang\u2019s access to hard currency. The foreign ministers also said North Korea should \u201cmake credible progress on its obligations to denuclearize\u201d as a condition for talks on a \u201cpeaceful solution.\u201dThe ministers alluded to widespread concerns that Russia and China have done too little to cut off trade with Pyongyang, urging \u201csupport for the full implementation of U.N. sanctions by all countries.\u201d The Trump administration is considering fresh sanctions on Chinese companies engaged in such business. Beijing has said it fully complies with restrictive measures.\u201cYes, more sanctions,\u201d Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn told reporters\u00a0on Monday, adding however that that wouldn\u2019t be enough. \u201cWe have to put pressure on China,\u201d he said. \u201cNinety percent of the economy of North Korea depends on China.\u201dWrite to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'Foreign Ministers Back U.S. on Koreas.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 11:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-takes-tough-line-on-north-korea-amid-differing-views-within-bloc-1500306903", "news_title": "EU Takes Tough Line on North Korea Amid Differing Views Within Bloc ", "keywords": "eu foreign policy, eu korea mediation, eu korea policy, eu sanctions on north korea,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers"}, {"content": "KABUL\u2014More civilians were killed and wounded in Kabul during in the first six months of 2017 than in war-ravaged Helmand, according to a United Nations midyear report on civilian casualties that showed deaths and injuries in Afghanistan remained near record levels documented last year.A rise in large-scale militant attacks in Kabul have had a profoundly destabilizing effect on the capital, where some roads are still locked down and some embassies have scaled back to skeleton staff after a massive truck bomb struck near the diplomatic enclave in May.The U.N. Assistance Mission to Afghanistan documented 5,243 civilian casualties across the country, including 1,662 dead and 3,581 wounded over the period, a decrease of less than 1% from last year, the report released Monday said. This included a 2% rise in civilian deaths and a 1% decline in injuries.The trend reflects the growing influence of the Taliban insurgency in rural areas, which has provided a bigger foothold and more recruits for it to carry out large-scale attacks targeting workers at rush hour in central Kabul and other major cities.The U.N. said civilian casualties in Kabul were almost twice as high as in Helmand, which is mostly under Taliban control and has long considered the country\u2019s most violent province. There were 1,048 civilian casualties in Kabul province over the period, including 219 deaths and 829 injured, a 26% increase from last year, the U.N. said.The rising urban toll could fuel concerns over plans by the European Union to deport Afghan migrants back home on the basis that some parts of Afghanistan, including Kabul, were safe enough for them to return. Around 200,000 Afghans arrived on the continent in 2015 in an effort to escape their country\u2019s ongoing conflict, according to the EU, and tens of thousands followed last year.Helmand, which is mostly under Taliban controlled, recorded the highest number of deaths, the report said. The U.S. military has sent more than 300 Marines to Helmand to help Afghan forces keep the provincial capital from falling to the insurgency, amid heavy daily clashes there.The U.N. report also showed a 23% rise in female casualties this year, including 174 women dead and 462 injured, and a rise in child deaths, which rose 9% to 436.Also in the first half of 2017, a rise in casualties linked to bombings weighed against a decline in those caused by clashes between government forces and insurgents, the U.N. report said. It attributed the drop to efforts by the army and police to exercise greater caution in using weapons that cause high casualties, including mortars.The deadliest attack in Kabul since 2001 struck on May 31, as a massive truck bomb exploded just outside Kabul\u2019s heavily-fortified diplomatic enclave, killing more than 150 people\u2014mainly Afghan civilians on their way to work.It triggered a wave of protests by locals angry about the government\u2019s failure to protect them, and more deaths in clashes with security forces, which contributed to frustration with the government beset by internal rivalry and entrenched corruption.Afghan and security officials from the international military coalition in the country are reviewing new security plans for Kabul. They include a dramatic expansion of the diplomatic enclave, known as the Green Zone, that would reduce the exposure of government and embassy buildings to city roads, a move that would further limit those officials\u2019 interaction with the local population.Write to Jessica Donati at Jessica.Donati@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'Kabul Bears Brunt of Civilian Casualties.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 11:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/afghanistans-capital-more-dangerous-than-helmand-province-u-n-says-1500302100", "news_title": "Afghanistan\u2019s Capital More Dangerous Than Helmand Province, U.N.

GS -0.20%       is set to release results for the second quarter before the market opens Tuesday. Here are five things to watch:1. Lower Revenue and ProfitAnalysts are projecting revenue of $7.52 billion and net income of $1.43 billion. Both figures are down from the second quarter of last year, when Goldman earned $1.82 billion on $7.93 billion of revenue. Analysts are forecasting that Goldman will post earnings of $3.39, on average, down from $3.72 a year ago.2. Bond TradingThe big surprise in the first quarter was Goldman\u2019s stumble in fixed-income trading, where it missed the big gains reported by rivals. A recovery this quarter would be a relief among investors and the Goldman brass; another stumble would likely spur calls for a shake-up on the firm\u2019s trading desks.3. Equities EdgeIt has been three years since Goldman lost its equities-trading crown to             Morgan Stanley.       In the first quarter, the trailing-year gap between revenue for the two firms in this area hit a record $1.2 billion after Goldman\u2019s equities revenue declined 2%. Executives say the firm has invested in technology that will take time to bear fruit.4. Investment BankingInvestment banking, the business of raising money for companies and advising on their deals, has been Goldman\u2019s reliable engine over the past few years. But now it appears poised for a slump. Of six key products spanning mergers and capital markets, only stock offerings are up year over year. What\u2019s more, fewer big mergers\u2014Goldman\u2019s bread and butter\u2014are getting done.5. The Elusive Fourth SegmentThree of Goldman\u2019s four reporting segments correspond to discrete business lines like trading and asset management. The fourth\u2014a $100 billion portfolio of loans and equity stakes called \u201cInvesting & Lending\u201d\u2014is drawn from several operating units and has long drawn investor complaints that it is opaque. Goldman broke out the unit a few years ago due in part to postcrisis regulations that encouraged lending over trading. Now investors will look for additional color about the portfolio to better understand what drives its performance.Write to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 11:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/5-things-to-watch-in-goldman-sachss-results-1500305457", "news_title": "5 Things to Watch in Goldman Sachs\u2019s Results ", "keywords": " 2q earnings, bank earnings, bank profit, earnings preview,goldman sachs earnings, investment banking, lloyd blankfein, second-quarter earnings, trading,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,banking,financial investments,investment banking,credit,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "PAUL GIGOT: Welcome to the \u2018Journal Editorial Report.\u2019 I\u2019m Paul Gigot.Senate Republicans released a revised version of their health care bill this week, hoping to jump-start their stalled effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare. President Trump urging members of his party to get it done, saying the time to act is now.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I am sitting in the Oval Office, with a pen in hand, waiting for our Senators to give it to me. For years, they have been talking about repeal, replace, repeal replace. Now we have a president that\u2019s waiting to sign it. I have pen in hand.GIGOT: So will changes to the bill be enough to get moderate Republican holdouts on board? Let\u2019s ask \u201cWall Street Journal\u201d columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; assistant editorial page editor,       James Freeman      ; and editorial board member, Joe Rago.Joe, the bill has changed for the better or worse, and how?JOE RAGO: Well, I would say both. This is a bill that\u2019s moved to the political center. It\u2019s moved leftward. It\u2019s worse in the sense that it gets rid of a lot of the tax\u2014it keeps a lot of the tax increases on investment income, 3.8 percentage\u2014GIGOT: That were part of ObamaCare.RAGO:\u2014that were part of it.GIGOT: That Republicans promised to repeal?RAGO: They did for years. And it spends that money on other stuff. It\u2019s got $45 billion for opioid treatment. It\u2019s got a lot more up-front Medicaid spending. It\u2019s good and better in the sense that it retains the fundamental Medicaid reform. That\u2019s really the most important part of this bill. Moving to a per capita block grant\u2014GIGOT: To the states from the federal government.RAGO: Right. A lot of devolution to the states and putting the program on a budget for the first time since 1965. It\u2019s a structural reform, which is the only way to rationalize the entitlement state.GIGOT: That still is the part, in your view, that is worth really worth passing this bill?RAGO: It is worth passing for that reason. The new bill also adds something from Senator Ted Cruz. It\u2019s called the freedom option. It\u2019s a lot of deregulation that will start to potentially bring down premiums in the individual market. That\u2019s the type of progress that we need to stand up, a more liquid, richer insurance market with more options and more competition.GIGOT: But this isn\u2019t the root-and-branch repeal of ObamaCare they promised. It\u2019s a compromise. It is sort of, let\u2019s try to please all sides of the Republican coalition.DAN HENNINGER: I guess so, Paul. I have a grimmer view of it. At the end of the day, what does the solution come down to? Something very familiar in Washington, throw more money at it, right? That\u2019s kind of what it came down to.GIGOT: More money because the so-called moderate, centrist Senators, the Rob Portman of Ohio, Mr. Cassidy of Louisiana, these are the people who wanted more money\u2014HENNINGER: You know something, Paul?GIGOT:\u2014for opioids and Medicaid.HENNINGER: We thought people like Portman, and Senator Cassidy from Louisiana, could be called conservatives. I think this is a moment of reckoning for the Republican Party. What we\u2019re finding out is that a lot of these Republican Senators really are not conservative, as the way we thought the party had evolved. A lot of them are acting like big- government Republicans, back from the 1970s. And what we saw was that when they got pushed, by the left and by the media, they caved. And they were sort of running from the party of Reagan. So I think that conservatives, whether they actually represent Republican and conservative voters, is another question. But this behavior on this bill suggests to me that the Republican Party has to step back and think a little bit about what they stand for.GIGOT: There\u2019s one Senator who\u2019s already said he\u2019s not even going to vote to a motion to proceed and that\u2019s       Rand Paul       of Kentucky. He\u2019s not a moderate. He\u2019s a Libertarian.Why would he blow up this bill? If this fails, James, you get ObamaCare.JAMES FREEMAN: Yes. And I think Republicans who vote against it also deserve primary challenges because the United States government has unfunded liabilities in the tens of trillions or perhaps the hundreds of trillions. This is one little baby step towards reforming the fastest-growing entitlement program\u2014GIGOT: Which is Medicaid.FREEMAN: Which is Medicaid. There\u2019s good evidence that you\u2019re no healthier with Medicaid than if you have no insurance at all. It\u2019s not working for anyone. And the idea that you can\u2019t begin to reform it, to have money spent better, it boggles the mind that Republicans can say no to this opportunity.GIGOT: And, Joe, the Cruz option, which I happen to like, being part of the bill, is that going to help with some of the conservatives?RAGO: Yes, you\u2019ve already started to see Senator Cruz, who had been calling this ObamaCare-lite, start to come on, Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, maybe Mike Lee from Utah. So it is starting to assuage them. They have sort of given up some of their reservations about this bill. As you said, it is not root-and-branch reform, but it is a net improvement and directional progress.GIGOT: But you think it\u2019s actually a pretty important reform?RAGO: I think it is pretty important reform. What James is talking about, with Medicaid, this bill saves $772 billion over 10 years. Now, look, that\u2019s not\u2014GIGOT: And even more as you go out.RAGO: Right. It\u2019s a structural reform that makes changes over the long-term. That\u2019s the type of change we need in Washington.GIGOT: All right. So here\u2019s\u2014step back and look at the politics. Republicans in the Senate in 2018 have one Senator in a tough race, Dean Heller of Nevada. One. Everyone else is generally pretty safe. They are 18 months from that election. One Senator, and if they can\u2019t make this pass right now, with that kind of a limited vulnerability, politically, 18 months from now, when will they ever pass any reform of entitlements?HENNINGER: Yes, it is a really good question, because what the Republican voters and the American electorate did was give them control of the government, after allowing the Democrats to control it. They passed the Affordable Care Act. They passed Dodd-Frank. There was obviously disaffection with both of those big pieces of legislation. Now it was the Republicans\u2019 chance, as they promised when they got control of the government, to revise these\u2014fix these things, and they are not pulling it off.GIGOT: Thank you. We will see. It\u2019s going to be a historic week.When we come back, President Trump\u2019s oldest son being pulled into the Russia probe after taking a meeting with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign. But is it proof of collusion? Our panel weighs in, next.GIGOT: The president\u2019s oldest son now being drawn into the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.       Donald Trump Jr       released e-mails earlier this week from 2016, showing that he agreed to meet with someone he believed to be a Russian government attorney after receiving an e-mail from a publicist offering him information that would incriminate Democratic presidential nominee,       Hillary Clinton.President Trump defended his son Thursday during his trip to Paris.TRUMP: I have a son who is a great young man. He is a fine person. He took a meeting with a lawyer from Russia. It lasted for a very short period and nothing came of the meeting. And I think it is a meeting that most people in politics probably would have taken.GIGOT: All right. Dan, so people say this finally proves that there is collusion, there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. How do you see it?HENNINGER: I don\u2019t think any serious Washington lawyer would agree with that, that there is collusion, an actionable act that could be taken to a prosecutor and prosecuted. But look, the media has had this narrative from the beginning, that there was collusion. They are going to chase it to the ends of the earth.Let\u2019s talk a little bit about what happened here. He met with these people to talk about opposition research, oppo, as we call it. oppo research happens in every campaign. Do campaigns meet with individuals from foreign governments? Yes, they have done that. Are there dirty tricks in politics? Yes, there is that.HENNINGER: But the difference here is that we know that the Russians did hack into the election, into servers.GIGOT: Right.HENNINGER: There\u2019s been congressional testimony that they hacked into, tried to hack into 20 state election systems as well. That is what is new here. And so the Trump\u2014Donald Trump Jr has walked up to the line with the Russians, where these two intersections meet. And that\u2019s why the prosecutors are now going to take a hard look at what this meeting was about.GIGOT: But the e-mail, the come-on e-mails was, look, this is part of\u2014we have dirt on the Clinton campaign, and we have also think that this is representing the support from the Russian government\u2014HENNINGER: Right.GIGOT:\u2014for the Trump campaign, and Donald Trump Jr said, \u201cI love it.\u201dHENNINGER: Yes.GIGOT: That suggests that he was happy\u2014he didn\u2019t object to help from the Russian government. This is a government that is not our friend.HENNINGER: And in a normal\u2014right. And in a normal campaign, you\u2019ve got the candidate, the people right below him. That would include Donald Trump Jr. If you get a request like that, you send somebody who is about five or six layers below that to go talk to them and see if they have anything. And then they talk to the lawyers in the campaign who say, \u201cGet away from these people.\u201d But, no, the Trumps took it on themselves.GIGOT: He even roped in       Jared Kushner,        the son-in-law, and       Paul Manafort,        you know, the Beltway lobbyist, who represents a lot of unseemly foreign clients. So I mean, at a minimum, it\u2019s stupidity, incompetence in my humble opinion, but it\u2019s hard to defend.FREEMAN: It is hard to defend. I think, certainly, a lot of people in Washington would like to get information. And you don\u2019t want to say it is illegal to gather information. But, yes, I think more seasoned political pros, maybe more classier, shall we say, politicians, might have at least wanted to keep more distance from this kind of meeting.But this kind of brings up the choice that people had last year, two very flawed candidates. And you look at what\u2019s happened here. We\u2019re a year into the collusion investigation. So far, nothing showing the Trump campaign actually doing anything.GIGOT: Well, wait a minute. This meeting isn\u2019t anything? It did something. They met.FREEMAN: Well, OK, a meeting, but I mean in terms of colluding, in terms of working together to rig an election, which is the charge.GIGOT: In terms of saying, OK, we have an idea, we\u2019re going to hack the Democratic National Committee, good idea. That we don\u2019t have any evidence of.FREEMAN: Right.GIGOT: On the other hand, if they say, we have some dirt on the Clintons, come and meet with us, they go, great. I mean, that\u2019s not\u2014that\u2019s not really very good politics.FREEMAN: It\u2019s distasteful. And it is\u2014we\u2019re seeing, really, the initial stages of learning about what happened\u2014where did this whole collusion theme come from? It looks like it may have come from Democratic-funded opposition research, seeking from Russian sources\u2014GIGOT: This is the so-called dossier\u2014FREEMAN: Right.GIGOT:\u2014that created that\u2014that has been discreditedFREEMAN: Right. So the question is, we seem to have two campaigns last year or at least two parties that were willing to take dirt on their opponents from foreign sources.GIGOT: But here\u2019s the thing. There\u2019s only one president right now.FREEMAN: True.GIGOT: Not Hillary Clinton. It is Donald Trump. He won. There\u2019s a special counsel looking into this regarding the Trump campaign.How much legal jeopardy is there here, Joe?RAGO: Well, I suppose it depends on the underlying merits of the case. Donald Trump Jr showed terrible judgment here in taking this meeting. But the question is, did it ever advance into anything that was not only unsavory and reflects poorly on the Trump family business, but into something that\u2019s potentially criminal? And\u2014GIGOT: We don\u2019t know that.RAGO: We don\u2019t know this. The Russian lawyer he met with was apparently arguing against the Magnitsky Act, which was a law that sanctioned\u2014American law that sanctioned Russian human rights abusers. It looks like, potentially, a cutout to lobby to weaken this law. But still other than the e-mail, nothing of substance seems to have come out of it.GIGOT: The other\u2014so far.RAGO: So far.GIGOT: And that\u2019s the question, Dan. They issued an incomplete account of this when it first came out.HENNINGER: RightGIGOT: And that\u2019s part of the problem. They released the e-mails two or three days later, which I\u2019m glad they did it. Let\u2019s get it all out. It\u2019s the sort of thing, instead of just trying to say, oh, well, at first, this is just a meeting about adoption, the Magnitsky Act related to adoption, they didn\u2019t get the truth out.HENNINGER: They didn\u2019t get the truth out. So now, what this ensures, as you were suggesting earlier, is that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and the lawyers working for him, are going to overturn and look at everything related to this campaign and the Trump people who were involved with it, Jared Kushner, Manafort, the president himself. They are going to want to look at all the e-mails, all the documents, all the phone records. That\u2019s the way these investigations work. And all of them are going to be preoccupied with this. Jared Kushner has had to hire his own lawyer. It is inevitable that it is going to preoccupy them.GIGOT: All right. When we come back, while the White House deals with its latest Russia headache, Congress seems to be creating one of their own, as a new Russia sanctions bill stalls in the House. What\u2019s the holdup all about?GIGOT: While the White House is facing fresh questions about Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 campaign, Congress is bogged-down in a debate over just how much authority to give President Trump to potentially ease sanctions against Moscow. The Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill last month to impose new penalties on Russia and to make sure the administration can\u2019t change course without congressional approval. But that measure has stalled in the House. What\u2019s behind the holdup?Let\u2019s ask Tennessee Senator       Bob Corker.       He\u2019s the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.So, welcome Mr. Chairman. Glad to have you here.So let me ask you first about the meeting that Donald Trump Jr had with the Russian\u2014during the campaign. Do you agree with President Trump that anybody would have taken this meeting?SEN. BOB CORKER: Well, Paul, good to be with you, first.Let me just say look, we have these daily drippings out of what had occurred during the campaign. We have a Senate Intel Committee that\u2019s going through this. They will be able to put all this in proper context. Personally, had I received a call from some\u2014about some Russian official wanting to give me information, I would have said no. But look, I think the Intel Committee can put all this in context. If I responded to these on a daily basis, Paul, I wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with the policy issues that we have to deal with. So I just think we ought to wait, let them go through all of this, and at the end, we will have everything in proper context.GIGOT: All right. Let\u2019s talk about that policy, the Russia sanctions. Passed the Senate 98-2. That\u2019s\u2014some republicans in the Senate and Democrats don\u2019t agree on much these days. Why the overwhelming support for this bill? Why the bipartisan support for this legislation?CORKER: I think that, you know, first of all, there had been concerns early on that maybe some cheap deal would be made with Russia over Syria that would eliminate the sanctions on eastern Ukraine or the sanctions relative to what Russia did there. In addition to that, the cyber issues, we want to make sure that we push back against all those who are involved in cyber issues. As Russia continues to privatize state-owned enterprises, we want to make sure that those who are, through corruption, unfairly benefitting from that we punished. We wanted to make sure those who were supplying arms to Assad were punished. We wanted to make sure those doing business with certain intel agencies and defense agencies within Russia were punished. I just think there\u2019s an overwhelming, on both sides of the aisle\u2014and I will say, candidly, among national security folks, within the Trump administration, a desire to push back against what Russia has done. And I strongly support this bill. Obviously, I think the House will take it up very soon.GIGOT: Right. OK, so on the sanctions provision, you have the additional sanctions. And the White House says we support the sanctions, but what we want is more presidential flexibility. And they don\u2019t like the fact that your bill denies the president the ability to\u2014the flexibility\u2014flexibility to ease sanctions if he comes to some agreement with the Russians. In the past, Democrats have insisted that       Barack Obama       have that kind of flexibility. Why not give it to this president in this case?CORKER: Well, if you remember, Paul, we had this same problem come up with Iran, where\u2014GIGOT: Right, I do remember.CORKER:\u2014Obama was able\u2014he was able to go straight to the U.N. Security Council, lift all the sanctions that Congress had put in place for eight years, which was not Congress\u2019s intention. So I\u2019m the one that\u2019s been leading the effort to ensure that we have congressional review. Had this provision been in place, the Iran deal, that I think was a terrible deal for our nation, would have never been put in place. So this is us asserting our rightful equal role in foreign policy. And I\u2019m all supportive. I\u2019m very supportive of congressional review. I feel like I\u2019ve led the charge on that. And it will be a part of this bill.GIGOT: So\u2014CORKER: When it comes out of the House. It will be part of the bill when it comes out of the House, no question.GIGOT: What if the House doesn\u2019t include it? Because the White House is pressuring the House not to include it, and it goes back to you guys.CORKER: It is going to come out with congressional review from the House. I get no sense whatsoever that they plan to change it. I have been on the phone just in the last 30 minutes with       Ed Royce.       I have talked to leaders on both sides of the aisle there. This bill will come back to us, I\u2019m absolutely convinced, with congressional review. It\u2019s the right place for us to be. And it will stay.GIGOT: All right. There\u2019s one other question, obviously, that we wrote about this week, which is the oil companies are objecting that the way the Senate bill is written, it could block American investments, not just in Russia, but anywhere around the world, if there was just a small bit of Russian participation in Brazil or Nigeria. Are you willing to get that fixed?CORKER: Yes. You and I have talked about it. And Ben Cardin and I, my Democratic counterpart, did a colloquy on the Senate floor to resolve this issue. I have talked to Treasury about this issue. I think they could fix it with colloquy. But McCarthy\u2019s staff has been over to see us about it. And as you know, it is about betting on grids out in the ocean.GIGOT: Right.CORKER: And the United States and U.S. company could bid on a grid out there and win, and right beside it could be a Russian entity. A lot of time, government says, hey, we want you all to form a consortium so we have one pipeline that\u2019s bringing that oil back. And that is an issue. It\u2019s a legitimate issue. And the House can either solve it through legislative text change, which I\u2019ve talked to Hoyer about it, and he\u2019s in agreement with that.GIGOT: OK.CORKER: Or they could do it through colloquy. But it is a legitimate issue.GIGOT: But you are willing to fix that? It sounds like it will be fixable.CORKER: Absolutely.GIGOT: OK.CORKER: And Senator Cardin, on the Democratic side in the Senate, is, too.GIGOT: All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate it.Still ahead,       Mitch McConnell       cuts the Senate\u2019s summer vacation short as the GOP scrambles to get some legislative wins. A look at what this Republican Congress has achieved in its first seven months, and what it still needs to do to satisfy voters ahead of the 2018 midterms.SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL: Due to this unprecedented level of obstruction that we have been experiencing, we will be in session the first two weeks of August.SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER: If I were them, I wouldn\u2019t want to go home and face the voters either.GIGOT: Blaming it on obstruction by Democrats, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cancelled almost half of the Senate\u2019s August recess this week, saying he will keep lawmakers in Washington in order to give Congress more time to make progress on President Trump\u2019s agenda. In addition to repealing and replacing ObamaCare, passing a budget, and beginning work on tax reform, are at the top of the to-do list. But Mr. McConnell also hopes to push through the backlog of more than 100 presidential nominees who have yet to be confirmed by the Senate.We\u2019re back with Dan Henninger, Joe Rago and James Freeman.James, let\u2019s take a step back here, for a second. As they approach the August recess, seven months, almost eight, into this\u2014I guess, it\u2019s seven into the presidency, typically, a time when a new Congress, a new government with the same party running both sides of Pennsylvania avenue, gets a lot done. What do they have to show for it so far?FREEMAN: By the traditional measures, maybe not much. We think of       Nancy Pelosi       and       Harry Reid       putting a huge $800 billion stimulus on Barack Obama\u2019s desk within a month, that hasn\u2019t really happened here. But if you are a Trump voter reflecting on your choice, you can say there\u2019s a great Supreme Court addition in       Neil Gorsuch.       You can talk about a burgeoning rollback of federal regulation, congressional review act bills, a lot of them have gone to the president\u2019s desk.GIGOT: How many, 13, I think, is that it, something like that? How many of them?FREEMAN: 13. These are basically rescinding rules from the Obama era. President Obama was the greatest regulator in history, measured by pages in the Federal Register. So there is a good start here. But the big the agenda items are still hanging out. And that\u2019s\u2014we talked about health care, and it is the big tax cut that I think a lot of workers, investors, really, everybody who wants a faster-growing economy is still waiting for.GIGOT: But there\u2019s also, Joe, the sort of the smaller bills that some of these new governments, Congress has put together, they really haven\u2019t done too many of those one on the Veterans Affairs.RAGO: There\u2019s one on V.A. There\u2019s some FDA, on the Food and Drug Administration. But there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s passed the House and hasn\u2019t gotten through the Senate.GIGOT: RightRAGO: Typically, a bottleneck on Capitol Hill. But I think you kind of have to look at this and be disappointed in what they\u2019ve done so far. Really not the kind of progress that traditionally happens.GIGOT: There are two big reasons here, Dan. One is, I think, that health care choice that they made, to go with health care first, has just proven to be a lot harder than they thought. First, in the House, it took longer. Now it is approaching a moment of truth in the Senate.But also, Democrats have really just done everything they can to slow the Senate down, particularly on nominations. How bad is it?HENNINGER: Well, it is very bad on nominations. I mean, there are many, many important seats in the government that have not been filled. I came in with a little bit of a list. They are just about to start moving: the U.S. ambassador to Japan, Bill Haggerty, the solicitor general, Noel Francisco, many undersecretaries and deputy secretaries,       Kevin Hassett,        who is going to be chairman of the Council of the Economic Advisors,       David Malpass,        undersecretary for international finance. These are very important positions that have not been fulfilled for seven months.GIGOT: But Chuck Schumer\u2019s response would be, well, they got so far behind, the Trump administration, in nominating them, what do you expect, it\u2019s their fault, not ours.HENNINGER: Ambassador Haggerty was nominated back in February. Some of these people have been sitting for six months. These are nominations that are not controversial.The thing here, though, Paul is, there\u2019s a new reality in Chuck Schumer\u2019s opposition. The Democrats are simply not participating in the government. Now, in fairness, the Republicans, in Obama\u2019s first term, did not participate in the passage of the Affordable Care Act or Dodd-Frank. So, that suggested, I was saying earlier, if you get control of the government, as these Republican Senators have now, you have to make a concerted effort to get some things done while you have those votes. That\u2019s what they are not doing.GIGOT: What Schumer has done is he\u2019s used every tool, procedural tool in the Senate to stretch out these nominations. So they have a 30-hour rule of debate, I think, they are stretching that out. When Harry Reid had cut a deal with Republicans limiting it to eight hours on any nominee. They are stretching everything out. They\u2019re stretching\u2014they are denying hearings under an archaic Senate rule.Republicans, what do they do about it, James?FREEMAN: Well, I think they may go further to change the rules. We saw how Chuck Schumer, the Democrats, basically put up the goal-line stand against Neil Gorsuch. Bad move. He was a blue-chip nominee. Should not have been a big fight about that. That ended up killing the filibuster for judicial nominees going forward. So I think, normally, the Senate, a lot of it runs on unanimous consent.GIGOT: Right.FREEMAN: And that\u2019s how they waive all these complicated rules that basically prevent anything from happening. If the Democrats are saying, no, we\u2019re going to insist on the rules that prevent anything from happening, I think Republicans will naturally look at what other rules ought to be rewritten.GIGOT: Let\u2019s assume health care passes this month, Joe, in the Senate, and they move on and it gets\u2014the House and Senate pass it before the end of the recess. Can they pass tax reform before the end of this year?RAGO: It\u2019s going to be hard. I mean, tax reform, I think, in a lot of ways will be harder than health care reform. The thing that will help is a sense of urgency. This has been so difficult on health care. I think this is a Congress that knows that they and the Trump administration are going to be judged on economic results, on their performance, and that might speed things along sort of tamp down some of these divisive debates.GIGOT: It is really do-or-die on tax reform, especially if they can\u2019t pass health care.All right. Still ahead, Iraq\u2019s prime minister declares victory over Islamic State in Mosul. But is the war against the terror group really coming to an end? What the U.S. needs to do to avoid repeating past mistakes, next.GIGOT: Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al Abadi declared victory this week over the Islamic State in Mosul where the terror group declared its so- called caliphate in 2014. But after a bloody three-year struggle there, my next guest says the fight is far from over.Seth Jones       is the director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the Rand Corporation and author of \u201cWaging Insurgent Warfare, Lessons from the Vietcong to the Islamic State.\u201dSeth Jones, welcome. Good to have you here.SETH JONES: Good to be on. Thanks, Paul.GIGOT: How significant, for American interests, we know it matters a lot to the Iraqis, but how significant for American strategic interests is this liberation of Mosul?JONES: I do think it is important. I think it is important to note that the U.S. strategy changed quite a bit in the 2003, 2004, 2005 period. And all the way up through the surge, the U.S. did a chunk of this kind of clearing with U.S. Marine or Army forces. In this case, the U.S. supported Iraqi counterterrorism forces, Kurdish militia and, unfortunately, some Shia in the area. So we\u2019ve done much better, I think, this time.GIGOT: Why do you say, unfortunately, some Shia? Because that\u2019s really Iranian front groups and militias.JONES: Yes. Well, the number of Iranian\u2014the amount of Iranian support here and the number of Shia militia in Iraq is staggering right now. Almost 150,000 mobilization\u2014GIGOT: Wow.JONES: That\u2019s pretty significant. It actually shows how much influence Iran has in Iraq right now.GIGOT: All right. Now the campaign against Islamic State also making progress inside Syria, where the fall of Raqqa, their headquarters in Syria, could also be heading that way. Is that victory? That liberation imminent, too?JONES: Probably not imminent. I think if the liberation of Mosul tells us anything, it\u2019s Raqqa and some of the villages and cities that sit south along the Euphrates River valley are going to be brutal fights. They\u2019re going to be filled with car bombs, suicide bombers. Children that are being used as shields in the fighting. I think it is likely going to be intense. But I think, in the end, the Americans are likely to prevail with their local allies and remove most of ISIS from these towns and villages, including Raqqa.GIGOT: OK. Let\u2019s assume that liberation does take place, you\u2019ve written for us this week that already the jihadists from Islamic State are spreading out and returning essentially to their insurgent strategy, blending into villages, smaller towns, waiting for another opportunity to regroup and, no doubt, committing terror along the way. What has to happen on the part of the Iraqi government and the U.S. to make sure that ISIS doesn\u2019t revive?JONES: Well, I think, at the core, we have to remember that this is primarily a political struggle going on, not a military one. And if we look at some of the Anbar cities like Fallujah and Ramadi, Fallujah was cleared by the U.S. in 2003.GIGOT: Right.JONES: Then we had insurgents move back. It was re-cleared. The last decade and a half has been constantly re-clearing some of these cities. So I think what has to happen is, in particular, in Sunni areas, some of the key issues that have disenfranchised Sunnis have got to be better addressed. That is, in part, a heavy political effort by the U.S. and U.S. diplomats to push the Iraqi government\u2014this is going to put it really at loggerheads with Iran\u2014to settle some of these Sunni disenfranchisement issues. And that is a large number of Shia militia, more rapid reconstruction in cities like Fallujah, now, Mosul and Ramadi. And then to treat this as a political rather than just a military struggle.GIGOT: So they can\u2019t seem to be\u2014the Baghdad government or with the Shiite forces that back Iran can\u2019t seem to be imposing a new kind of tyranny on those Sunni areas of Anbar Province in Iraq. Because that\u2019s the root, that\u2019s the base from which the insurgency grows.JONES: That\u2019s an important base of support. If one looks at the rise of the Islamic State in 2014, certainly, its ability to gain sanctuary in Syria was helpful, but also ability to take advantage of grievances among the Sunni populations, who identified their government in Baghdad as essentially an Iranian stooge, was a key component of ISIS getting into that area.GIGOT: All right. What would be your recommendation to the Trump administration about how to handle U.S. forces there? We\u2019ve got several thousand that are on the ground there, mostly special forces, advisors, and targeters. But should we negotiate a more permanent presence there off troops, 10,000 or so, of the kind that President Obama refused to do in 2011?JONES: Yes, I think there\u2019s no question right now the U.S. needs to recognize that Iraq does have a strategic importance for the United States. I don\u2019t think it requires a large number of U.S. conventional forces.GIGOT: Right.JONES: But I do think it does require for the U.S. to remain, to remain and have access to Iraqi bases. To continue to train Iraq\u2019s counterterrorism service, which was incredibly important in the retaking of Mosul, and will be in the retaking of other cities, including al Khayyam in Iraq. To continue to train Iraqi police forces, which will be the bedrock for law enforcement in Fallujah and Ramadi and other Sunni-heavy cities in the future. So those are some of the key issues. And to keep\u2014try to push out and then demobilize some of the Shia militia forces operating in the country right now, which is counterproductive for the U.S. forces.GIGOT: So, in a way, it\u2019s a counterforce, would be a counterforce, at least politically, not militarily, politically, to Iranian influence in Iraq and, I assume, maybe a balancing role politically. You have the Kurds in the north. You have the Shiites in the south and the east. And then you have the Sunnis. So there\u2019s kind of a political balancing role here, too?JONES: Yes, I think there is a clear political balancing role. The Kurds in the north have generally been pretty effective over the long run in taking care of their own security. I think the balance there is there is a growing interest in broader Kurdish independence\u2014GIGOT: Right.JONES:\u2014linking up with Kurdish units in Syria and Turkey. Slightly different struggle than the Sunni fight down in Anbar. So there are multiple political issues the U.S. will have to balance.GIGOT: Thank you very much, Seth Jones, for being here. Appreciate it.JONES: Thanks, Paul.GIGOT: When we come back, the so-called \u201cSummer of Hell\u201d has started for New York area commuters as long-needed repairs divert tens of thousands of riders from the nation\u2019s busiest rail hub. A look at what\u2019s behind the rising costs and mounting delays in infrastructure projects across the country, next.GIGOT: It\u2019s being dubbed the \u201cSummer of Hell\u201d as tens of thousands of commuters in the New York area scramble to find alternative routes to work. Hundreds of trains that run through New York City are being delayed or diverted this summer as Amtrak makes long-overdue repairs to tracks at Penn Station, the busiest rail hub in north America. Derailments are now common. And New York City subway breakdowns almost a daily occurrence. But the mess is just a sign of things to come, as officials make plans to repair the 107-year-old tunnel under the Hudson River, which was badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\u201cWall Street Journal\u201d editorial page writer, Allysia Finley, joins us with more on this ongoing saga.And condolences to Brother Freeman who commutes from New JerseySo, Allysia, what is behind this mess?ALLYSIA FINLEY: Look, as you mentioned, there are nearly daily breakdowns. That is because they have not invested the money into repairing the system over the past 20, 30 years.GIGOT: Or 70 or 80.FINLEY: Some of them date back to the \u201830s. They are analog signals and they haven\u2019t gotten around to computerizing them. And they are working on it but it will not be done for another half a century.GIGOT: So I guess the politicians would say, well, we just need to spend more money on this and it would be fine. If the politicians in Washington weren\u2019t so\u2014such tightwads, we could just do this. But is that really\u2014is it really simple, more cash?FINLEY: Most of the cash goes to the labor costs, including pensions. 60 percent of the MTA, New York City\u2019s subways, go to labor costs.GIGOT: 60 percent?FINLEY: 60 percent. Pension costs have doubled in the last decade. That is where the money is going, to the public unions, not to these improvements.GIGOT: Even the money that\u2019s earmarked for transportation ends up going to labor costs or pension costs\u2014that\u2019s not even current workers\u2014rather than in the upkeep of the plant.Let\u2019s take the MTA, for example, subway cars. If you invest in the unions, the workers, you skimp over the years on things like buying trains or upgrading signals.FINLEY: That\u2019s right. The politicians have been paying off their public unions, who are big donors to their campaign, and just neglected these repairs. But they\u2019ve also been investing to an extent in some, you know, the 2nd Avenue subwayGIGOT: Right. They finally built that after\u2014FINLEY: They could cut some ribbons. They can maybe win some more voters on the Upper East Side.GIGOT: There\u2019s, I think, four stations there. Thank you very much. It\u2019s a lovely subway. But it is not\u2014if it keeps\u2014if all the other trains keep breaking down, it really doesn\u2019t help, James?FREEMAN: Yes, lead us not into Penn Station, is the fervent prayer of all commuters.So I think viewers around the country, don\u2019t live here, they just beyond our griping. I think they appreciate how this does have a larger meaning here.GIGOT: Yes.FREEMAN: Because this really is the failure, you could say, of blue state governance, you could say of government period, in terms of costs have been driven up by labor laws, but also environmental impact statements, everything that goes into making an infrastructure project so difficult, time consuming, expensive. There\u2019s a Republican member of Congress who is trying to get $900 million in funding for a new tunnel under the Hudson River. It sounds like a lot of money. It is a drop in the bucket. It is projected to cost $20 billion. I think there\u2019s a real opportunity here and around the country for a politician who wants to say privatize, let\u2019s bid out the rights to these things, and let\u2019s take away the rules because we need more infrastructure here.GIGOT: And just to elaborate on your point, this is not just about New York City at all. We\u2019re talking about the Amtrak corridor from Boston all the way down to Richmond, Virginia.FREEMAN: Right.GIGOT: It needs new investment, if you want to maintain that train service.FINLEY: We are talking the entire country. This are issues, the labor costs, project labor agreements for the west coast and east coast. It is breaking down. It\u2019s probably more visible where you have a lot of commuters. But the same problems are occurring everywhere.GIGOT: And where some of the systems are the oldest here because some of the tracks were laid and the infrastructure laid in the 1930s, \u201820s, and earlier, Dan?HENNINGER: Well, there\u2019s a big question of whether it\u2019s doable at all or whether these, as James was suggesting, blue state, blue cities, New York, Boston, are so dysfunctional, that they are not going to get the job done. I mean, they argue that the transportation systems are, you know, crucial to the economic integrity of those\u2014GIGOT: They love public transit.HENNINGER: But if it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s going to be solved by out migration. By people moving out of the north, into areas of the south, where they do have viable transportation systems. And I think you will just see something like Detroit happening, where it\u2019s simply winds down because they can\u2019t get it done.GIGOT: All right. Thank you all.We have to take one more break. When we come back, \u201cHits & Misses\u201d of the week.GIGOT: Time now for our \u201cHits & Misses\u201d of the week\u2014James?FREEMAN: Paul, this is a hit to             Facebook                   founder and CEO,       Mark Zuckerberg.       His company collects terabytes of data about all of us. Apparently, it is not enough. So he is personally going out to middle America to meet people, find out what their concerns are, hockey moms, steelworkers, oil workers. I think there\u2019s some question of what his motives are here. Is it marketing? Is it about a political run? But I think we ought to give him some credit. He\u2019s one coastal elitist who is willing to go out and find out how the rest of the country lives.GIGOT: All right, James.Allysia?FINLEY: I want to give a hit to modern medicine and the FDA for recommending this innovative new \u201cT\u201d cell treatment that harnesses the immune system to attack cancer cells in leukemia patients. This is a huge medicine breakthrough that opens up all kinds of possibilities.GIGOT: And the Food and Drug Administration looks like it might even approve it.Dan?HENNINGER: I\u2019m going to give a miss to the idea of \u201cboys meets girls.\u201d The \u201cWall Street Journal\u201d recently reported that guys are no longer picking up tab on dates with women. They\u2019re actually asking them to split it, or even pay it for themselves. Now, you have to ask, what is going on here? Partly, I guess it\u2019s because dating has become very expensive.

That boon may come at the expense of providers.It has been good to be in the health insurance business in recent years.\u00a0The five largest publicly traded insurers have outperformed the S&P 500 by an average of 15 percentage points so far\u00a0this year and have solidly outperformed the market since the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010. Investors expect strong second quarter results when             UnitedHealth Group                   reports on Tuesday.At least one provision in the new health bill, governing so-called medical loss ratios, could be a further benefit to insurers, including UnitedHealth. Under the ACA, the federal government requires insurers to spend 80% of premiums revenue, received for individual and small-business plans, on health costs. For large employer plans, the share is 85%. If an insurer doesn\u2019t hit the required ratio, it has to rebate the extra money to customers.That sounds like a good way to control costs, but minimum spending rules actually can push expenses higher. Consider a hypothetical insurer with half of its plans in the individual and group markets, respectively. Its minimum medical loss ratio would be 82.5%.If this company expects $82.50 in costs for the year, it can book $100 in revenue from premiums. The result is $17.50 in gross profit under that scenario. However, suppose the insurer expects costs of $90. The insurer could book up to $109.09 in premiums and satisfy the law, which results in gross profit of $19.09.Higher costs would of course hurt insurer results if companies couldn\u2019t anticipate expenses properly in the year ahead, so insurers need to forecast those costs properly. An inability to pass those costs along to customers would also hurt.\u00a0But insurers haven\u2019t had much trouble on that front.Analysts at Leerink Partners said in a note that insurers are asking state regulators for average premium hikes of 21% on individual exchange plans for next year.This phenomenon limits the incentive for cost control, rather than enhancing it. The result has been a boon for providers of health care, such as drug manufacturers and hospitals.But these rules could change\u2014the latest Senate bill calls for states to set their own rules on minimum ratios beginning in 2019. That would give insurers an opportunity to boost profit margins, and potentially push the insurance stocks even higher.But lower required loss ratios mean that insurers can make more money by paying for fewer services. That scenario could mean less spending on care, which could hit investors in other health sectors.The Affordable Care Act has helped nearly all health stocks higher. A change in loss ratio rules could mean a different story for the sector in the years to come.Write to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 11:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-new-rules-could-pinch-health-stocks-1500304511", "news_title": "How New Rules Could Pinch Health Stocks", "keywords": "affordable care act,health care costs,health care overhaul,health law,medical loss ratios,senate vote,UnitedHealth Group,UNH,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,society,community,welfare,social services,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014The Chinese government is putting the brakes on Dalian Wanda Group\u2019s overseas deals, clouding the company\u2019s ambitions to become a global entertainment powerhouse.Regulators met with executives at the country\u2019s big state-owned lenders June 20 and advised them that six of Wanda\u2019s recent foreign transactions were at odds with government capital restrictions enacted last year, according to a document from one of the participating banks that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.Banking regulators had previously asked lenders to review loans made to five big overseas deal makers, including Wanda, to assess whether their escalating debt posed a credit risk.HNA Group, which was among those mentioned, has drastically slowed its deal making since then.\u201dCross-border movement of funds is the background of this,\u201d said Keith Pogson, a senior partner for financial services at Ernst & Young. Regulators \u201care sending a clear message to the market that they\u2019re going to make it difficult for companies to finance overseas deals.\u201dWanda, controlled by billionaire       Wang Jianlin,        started as a property developer but moved into entertainment to diversify and expand its holdings. It owns the world\u2019s largest cinema chain, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., as well as Legendary Entertainment, a Hollywood film producer and financier.It struck a $1 billion deal to buy Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Productions last year, but later dropped those plans amid escalating Chinese government concerns over capital outflows that put pressure on its currency.Wanda can\u2019t use its own funds in China to pay for those overseas deals should the acquired assets run into any financing difficulties, the document shows. Wanda also is banned from injecting those foreign assets into its listed company in China, according to the document.Some Chinese banking officials say the new rules effectively cut off another method for paying for overseas acquisitions by using assets onshore as collateral to borrow overseas funds.Wanda used that method to help finance two of its largest cross-border deals last year. The company paid $3.5 billion to buy Legendary Entertainment and paid shareholders $4.4 billion to delist its main property unit from the Hong Kong stock exchange. In both cases, Wanda promised investors equity stakes in return for their funds once the assets were listed in China.The document, a portion of which was reviewed by the Journal, refers to four completed and two pending foreign deals.The other two deals involved are possible multibillion-dollar investments by Wanda in property developments in Indonesia and Malaysia, the person said. Chinese authorities won\u2019t give Wanda regulatory approvals for the two pending deals, according to the person and the document. A person close to the company said those deals never moved beyond preliminary talks.The fact that Chinese regulators are retroactively going back to old deals is unusual, Mr. Pogson said.The directive would appear to block Wanda from getting new financing in connection with past and future deals from Chinese banks. In addition, it clouds financing for the two pending deals.Last week, Dalian Wanda announced that it would sell most of its theme parks and hotels to developer             Sunac China Holdings Ltd.       for $9.28 billion to improve its balance sheet.Regulatory filings showed that Wanda will lend $4.35 billion to Sunac, using a bank as an intermediary, to help Sunac pay for the theme-park business, Sunac\u2019s regulatory filings show.Write to Lingling Wei at lingling.wei@wsj.com and Wayne Ma at wayne.ma@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Wanda\u2019s two overseas deals still pending are proposed investments in Malaysia and Indonesia.

This marked the third straight month-over-month drop in sales, and the second consecutive month transactions declined by over 6%.On an actual, not seasonally adjusted basis, sales fell 11.4% on a year-over-year basis in June.Meanwhile, the association\u2019s index measuring house prices slowed for a third straight month, climbing 15.8% in June from a year ago, or off from the recent April peak of a nearly 20% advance.The Ottawa-based association said the results reflect the impact measures from the province of Ontario introduced in April are having to end speculative real estate activity in Toronto and the surrounding area. The measures, chief among them a tax on foreign buyers of residential real estate, \u201cclearly prompted many home buyers in the greater [Toronto] region to take a step back and assess how the housing market absorbs the changes,\u201d said Gregory Klump, CREA\u2019s chief economist.A slowdown was expected after the local Toronto real estate board said sales in June fell over 37% from the same year-ago month. In June, the average price for a residence rose 6.3% in a year; in comparison, back in March, the average price rose over 33% in a 12-month period.The Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate last week by a quarter-percentage point to 0.75%, and its commentary suggests more rate increases are likely in the offing. Mr. Klump said this too will weigh on national sales in the coming months.The rate rise \u201ccould reinforce a lack of urgency to purchase or, alternatively, move some buyers off the sidelines before their preapproved mortgage rate expires,\u201d Mr. Klump said.Some economists said worries over exuberance in pockets of the Canadian housing market\u2014most notably Toronto and Vancouver\u2014reinforced the Bank of Canada\u2019s appetite to raise rates amid improving economic data. Bank of Canada Gov.       Stephen Poloz       said last week the rate increase would help reinforce nonrate tools implemented by federal and provincial authorities to date to curb borrowing, and keep housing prices in check.Canadian households are carrying record levels of debt, with borrowing climbing at a roughly 6% pace from a year ago. Most of that debt is held in mortgages and drawdowns on home equity lines of credit.\u201cThe Canadian housing market is now in its third month of what is expected to be a soft landing. The weakness was triggered by changes to provincial and federal housing policy, but it will ultimately be higher interest rates that help solidify it,\u201d said Diana Petramala, economist at TD Bank, in a note to clients. The bank\u2019s economics team projects existing home prices in Canada to decline 2.1% in 2018, with the bulk of the softness concentrated in the overheated Toronto and Vancouver markets.On an average-price basis, the cost of buying a home in Canada in June edged 0.4% upward to 504,000 Canadian dollars ($400,000)\u2014although when the Toronto and Vancouver markets are excluded, the average price comes in just shy of C$400,000.While the slowdown in Toronto and area sales pulled down the national real estate activity.\u00a0CREA said half of all local housing markets recorded year-over-year sales declines.The number of newly listed homes slid 1.5% in June, led by a sizable pullback in the Toronto region compared with record levels in April and May. The national sales-to-new listings ratio now stands at 52.8%, or down from the high-60% range just three months earlier. A sales-to-new listings ratio between 40% and 60% is consistent with balanced housing market conditions, the association said.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 11:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-housing-sales-decline-steeply-in-june-1500302446", "news_title": "Canada Housing Sales Decline Steeply in June", "keywords": "bank of canada,canada housing, canada interest rates, housing, housing sales, resale,Bank of Canada,Canadian Real Estate Association,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,home sales,housing affordability,economic news,housing sales,real estate markets,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "Ten years ago, computer-driven traders pulled the plug after their algorithms ran amok, leading to billions in losses and the eventual closure of             Goldman Sachs\u2019s       flagship quantitative fund.A decade on, artificial intelligence and machine learning are the buzzwords in automated investment. But for all the hype, applying AI to investment has three serious problems: it works too well, it is often impossible to understand, and it only knows about recent history. Worse, it will be self-defeating if it proves popular, as algorithms face off against each other in the market.Machine-learning systems are now really good at spotting patterns. Unfortunately, computers are just too good, and frequently find patterns that aren\u2019t really there.Michael Kollo, chief strategist at Axa IM Rosenberg Equities, points to the neural network\u2014a type of AI loosely modeled on brains\u2014developed by three University of Washington researchers\u00a0to distinguish between pictures of wolves and dogs by associating wolves with snow.\u201cIt can easily identify something of an intransigent nature and learn one rule from it,\u201d he says. Train an AI on the last 35 years of markets, and it might well develop a single simple rule: buy bonds. With 10-year Treasury yields down from 13.7% in July 1982 to 2.31%\u00a0on Monday, it worked beautifully in hindsight\u2014but yields can\u2019t possibly fall that much again in the next 35 years.In the industry, spotting patterns that don\u2019t repeat is known as \u201coverfitting\u201d\u2014picking up on the irrelevant snow in the picture of a wolf, or chance patterns in past stock prices that bear no relation to the future.David Harding,        founder of hedge fund Winton Group, says finding ways to avoid such fake patterns is at the core of computer-driven investment.\u201cAvoiding overfitting is a state of mind,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing as avoiding wishful thinking.\u201dAnthony Ledford,        chief scientist at quant fund Man AHL, says more advanced machine learning systems sometimes prove less useful, too. \u201cThe more complicated your model the better it is at explaining the data you use for the training and the less good it is about explaining the data in the future,\u201d he says. A model needs to accept that much that goes on in markets is meaningless noise, and try to pick out broader signals, even if it leaves some moves in past data unexplained.Many quantitative investors try to avoid overfitting by insisting that any rule they adopt should have an economic or behavioral rationale. If the computer finds that every third\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0when it rains in Kansas the stocks of oil companies listed in Paris go up, betting on it happening in future would be no more than a leap of faith.Unfortunately, explaining why a system with thousands of inputs made a decision can be all but impossible\u2014and is such a serious problem that America\u2019s defense research agency is financing\u00a0a program to try to produce AI which explains itself.The lack of transparency means the most advanced systems tend to be run on a tentative basis, with only a small amount of money or with human oversight of the recommendations.Charles Ellis       is typical. He joined Mediolanum Asset Management in Dublin in November to develop machine learning systems, with the first up and running providing recommendations for sectors. Given 20 years of data on 1,500 variables related to U.S. stocks, it uses a machine learning system known as random forest regression to try to avoid overfitting, and early results are good, he says. It is being used only for a small part of the $20 billion portfolio, with final decisions still made by fund managers. A second system designed to try to predict the economic cycle is currently bullish.The drawback of the random forest method is that it is hard to understand why the computer reached any particular decision.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a black box in that you don\u2019t know why [the input]\u2019s having that effect,\u201d he says.Mr. Kollo says it will be hard to avoid shutting down a system when it loses money if it isn\u2019t properly understood.\u201cAll things go wrong eventually, every algorithm has a bad day,\u201d he says. \u201cThe difference between those that survive and don\u2019t is those that can explain what they do.\u201dSome investors don\u2019t care about the lack of transparency.       Jeffrey Tarrant,        whose Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners invests in hedge funds, says it \u201cdoesn\u2019t bother me at all.\u201d He\u2019s invested in six funds which use AI methods\u2014typically combined with unusual data sources\u2014and whose managers come from nonstandard backgrounds. He estimates there are 75 funds which say they use AI, but thinks only 25 really do.Investors who have long managed money using computers are scornful of the latest fashion for AI.\u201cThirty years of being treated like an idiot for saying you can manage money with computers, and now they come along and say you can manage money with computers,\u201d scoffs Mr. Harding at Winton.His application of a form of machine learning to moving averages of futures prices helped him become a billionaire. His team treats machine learning as just another statistical technique to spot market anomalies.Sushil Wadhwani       used machine learning when head of systems trading at hedge fund Tudor two decades ago, and now runs his own automated fund using machine learning\u2014but overrides the systems occasionally. In 2008 he turned off the European bond analysis because it had learned that spreads between the best and worst eurozone bonds didn\u2019t depend on economic fundamentals, after years of evidence. As the banking system imploded, he knew this no longer applied.\u201cIt would be very difficult for a machine to learn that unless it knew it should be looking at the 1930s,\u201d he says.High-frequency systems may get enough examples of changing trading regimes to run on their own, but can\u2019t deploy much capital. Applying machine learning to longer-term investment is tricky when many of the new data sets being deployed only go back a decade or two. Computers with no knowledge of history are doomed to repeat its mistakes.Write to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'On the Random Walk, Don\u2019t Fear Robots.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 11:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/robotic-hogwash-artificial-intelligence-will-not-take-over-wall-street-1500304343", "news_title": "Robotic Hogwash!

But the outlook appears hazier when considering the property market\u2019s outsize role in the economy, jittery consumers and signs that significant deleveraging hasn\u2019t fully set in.Beijing said domestic demand fueled 6.9% growth in the second quarter, a result that matched the first-quarter growth rate and beat economists\u2019 forecasts. However, economists and analysts say the result has to be measured against a continued reliance on problematic sectors such as real estate and a lack of meaningful progress toward cutting the country\u2019s debt.Meanwhile, Chinese consumers aren\u2019t spending as fast as their wages rise, suggesting many have become more financially strapped because of high property prices.The latest data is \u201ca blip amid a growth deceleration,\u201d said China economist Larry Hu at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong.Armed with a more stable yuan and reduced capital outflows, Beijing has been able to tighten credit without causing market panic or affecting headline growth. That effort has forced banks and other financial institutions to cut back on borrowing from each other. But it hasn\u2019t led to significant debt reduction in the economy.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been too much deleveraging going on,\u201d said Zhu Chaoping, a Shanghai-based economist at UOB Kay Hian.In June, Chinese banks issued a higher-than-expected 1.54 trillion yuan in new loans, or roughly $227 billion, compared with 1.1 trillion yuan in May. More than a third of that amount went to home lending. Indeed, a resilient property market is the most important driver of China\u2019s growth so far, according to economists including Messrs. Zhu and Hu.The results mean that in a year that will see a twice-a-decade leadership transition, Beijing will have little problem reaching its full-year growth target of about 6.5%.But Beijing has to continue to clamp down on credit to shift to a more sustainable growth model, leaders say. If growth slows in the coming months, that clampdown could become more difficult. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be too optimistic about the economic picture in the second half of the year,\u201d said Sheng Songcheng, a senior adviser at the People\u2019s Bank of China.Should growth weaken, Mr. Sheng said, the PBOC likely will gradually guide down the short-term interest rates used to price bonds and bank-to-bank loans and ease the liquidity constraints on the country\u2019s financial system to help the economy. That would mark a shift in strategy since late last year, when the PBOC embarked on an untraditional tightening path by pushing up the short-term rates while leaving unchanged the benchmark rates.Beijing faces a policy dilemma in its battle to tame the property market, which, together with construction and home furnishings, now contributes to a third of the overall economy. It doesn\u2019t want home prices to soar for fear of destabilizing bubbles; on the other hand, it needs to prevent a property crash that could torpedo the economy.Since late last year, a series of measures intended to curb home buying has helped slow the run-up in home prices in megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. Yet those measures have done little to deter potential buyers. Many of them have simply flocked to smaller cities.Nationwide, property sales jumped 16% from a year earlier in the second quarter, primarily driven by the gains in medium-size and small cities. Property investment continued to accelerate in the first half. Still, there were signs that developers tempered investment toward the end of the period, expecting buyers to scale back amid purchasing restrictions.In addition, the rising property prices are causing many consumers to tighten their purse strings. In the first six months, wages earned by urban residents increased 6.5%, on average, according to official data. By comparison, their consumption picked up at a slower pace of 5.1%. Property-related expenses represented the second-largest share of consumption after food and alcohol.The gap indicates the toll that high home prices are taking on consumption as well as growing uncertainty among ordinary Chinese about the economy, economists and labor experts say.One of them is       Wang Jun,        a 30-year-old car salesman in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou. Unwilling to be left out of the housing boom, Mr. Wang earlier this year bought a property with a mortgage payment that makes up about 75% of his monthly income. \u201cI have to be frugal,\u201d Mr. Wang said.Write to Lingling Wei at lingling.wei@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'China\u2019s Growth Masks Signs of Trouble.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 11:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-problem-with-chinas-economic-growth-1500303789", "news_title": "China\u2019s Growth Masks Unresolved Debt and Real-Estate Problems", "keywords": "china debt,china economy,china expansion,china gdp,china growth,china property ,china real estate,economic performance,indicators,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,real estate markets"}, {"content": "The U.K. and the European Union began Brexit talks in earnest Monday, with a four-day negotiating session on a set of thorny issues the EU wants largely resolved before discussions turn to a future trade deal.U.K. Brexit Secretary David Davis and the EU\u2019s top negotiator       Michel Barnier       returned to the negotiating table in Brussels for the first time since the official opening of talks on June 19, with the focus on U.K. and EU citizens\u2019 rights after Brexit and how much London must pay to cover the U.K.\u2019s outstanding financial commitments to the bloc.The two sides also are due to discuss how to manage the U.K.\u2019s border with Ireland after withdrawal, expected in March 2019.The EU has insisted progress must be made on these and other separation issues before it will consider discussing future economic ties to the U.K., highlighting the challenge of agreeing a far-reaching settlement on Brexit within the 18 months remaining for talks.\u201cWe made a good start last month, and as Michel says we are now getting into the substance of the matter,\u201d Mr. Davis said, adding that it is \u201ctime to get down to work and make this a successful negotiation.\u201dMr. Barnier said he and Mr. Davis will remain in touch throughout the week as their teams get to work and will reconvene \u201cto take stock\u201d on Thursday.Mr. Barnier said last week there are major differences on key points. The EU proposed granting EU citizens in the U.K. and U.K. citizens in the EU rights to work and benefits similar to those that they already enjoy. The U.K. countered with proposals offering EU citizens \u201csettled status\u201d that confers many but not all existing rights as well as a pathway to British citizenship. There are around 3 million EU nationals in Britain and more than 1 million U.K. nationals living in the union\u2019s 27 other member states.Despite such differences, analysts say that the two sides should be able to reach a deal on citizens\u2019 rights, but a much bigger disagreement looms over money.The EU estimates the U.K. is on the hook for upward of \u20ac60 billion euros ($69 billion) in spending pledges made but not yet fulfilled.The prospect of payment on such a scale is political dynamite in the U.K., where advocates of Brexit won last year\u2019s referendum in part on a promise to stop sending Brussels any money at all.Boris Johnson, U.K. foreign secretary, last week dismissed such demands as \u201cextortionate\u201d and agreed with a colleague in Parliament that the EU could \u201cgo whistle\u201d for such a sum.Yet the U.K. government subsequently conceded in a written statement to Parliament that Britain is prepared to make \u201ca fair settlement\u201d with the EU and that it may keep making payments even after withdrawal.\u201cMoney is clearly going to be the stormiest dossier in phase one of the negotiations,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director at Eurasia Group.The negotiations come amid renewed signs of squabbling between senior British politicians over policy priorities, adding to signs of instability in Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       government after a poor showing in a June election cost her ruling Conservative Party its Parliamentary majority and sapped her authority.Treasury chief       Philip Hammond       on Sunday hit out at colleagues he accused of anonymously briefing against him after Sunday newspapers carried critical stories.

About Your Deposits\u2026Bank of America has benefited from the Federal Reserve\u2019s short-term interest-rate increases, in part because it hasn\u2019t passed those higher rates onto deposit customers. But many say the bank will eventually have to raise deposit rates, so keep an eye on what it reports paying on U.S. interest-bearing deposits during the quarter. Last quarter, that figure stood at an ultra-low 0.09%.4. Yield Curve BallThe Charlotte, N.C.-based lender is expected to benefit more than its peers from higher interest rates. But the lender has signaled that gains in net-interest income may flag this quarter, in part because of downward pressure on long-term bond yields. In May, Bank of America cut its expectations for growth in net interest income for the second quarter from the first.5. Trading SlumpBank of America and other big banks have signaled a drop in second-quarter trading results from a year earlier, and the results Friday from         Citigroup Inc.       and         J.P. Morgan Chase               & Co. confirmed the trend at those banks. Analysts expect trading revenue at BofA to be down between 10% and 12% in the quarter from the year earlier.Write to Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel.ensign@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 10:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/5-things-to-watch-in-bank-of-americas-results-1500303427", "news_title": "5 Things to Watch in Bank of America\u2019s Results", "keywords": " bank earnings,bank of america earnings, bank profit, bofa earnings preview,brian moynihan, deposits, interest income, lending, trading,Bank of America,BAC,BACL,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,banking,credit,financial services,integrated banks"}, {"content": "Worries about ESPN have weighed on Walt             Disney\u2019s       stock price over the past two years. Soon, Disney will have a chance to do something about it.Disney is set to begin talks over its contract with cable operator             Altice USA,        ATUS -1.16%       which expires this fall. The deal will be the first of a series of new contracts Disney will negotiate with pay-TV providers that will allow it to offset subscriber declines at ESPN.ESPN has struggled as expensive long-term contracts to broadcast sports kicked in just as subscribers were starting to flee. Now its challenge is to recoup those costs by raising prices and tightening rules over how many subscribers can migrate to TV packages that exclude ESPN.The sport network\u2019s presence in U.S. pay-TV households has fallen by around 6 percentage points to 89% since fiscal 2013, according to MoffettNathanson. The research firm estimates ESPN has lost more than 5 million subscribers from people downgrading to less expensive \u201cskinny\u201d bundles.Disney can\u2019t stop U.S. consumers from dropping pay TV. But it can offset the decline by boosting its annual price increases and by using \u201cminimum penetration guarantees\u201d\u2014provisions in its contracts that stipulate which TV packages ESPN must appear on and what portion of pay-TV subscribers must receive it. The ideal outcome might include a combination of both.Assuming Disney already increases the prices it charges cable and satellite companies for ESPN by 5% a year, bumping that up to 6% as it signs new deals would boost fee revenue by 4% a year to $12.56 billion from 2016 to 2022, MoffettNathanson estimates. This assumes its subscriber base declines at a compound annual rate of 2%. If Disney can use minimum penetration guarantees to add back 2.5 million of the subscribers it lost to skinny bundles, it could get an additional $400 million in fee revenue over the period, the firm says.There may be other levers at Disney\u2019s disposal, including the August 2019 launch of the ACC Network for which ESPN will split the profits with the Atlantic Coast Conference. Another is Disney\u2019s planned streaming service with BAMTech, which will feature sports that don\u2019t appear on ESPN\u2019s TV channels. If all of this goes in Disney\u2019s favor, its compound annual growth rate for domestic cable revenue from affiliate fees would be 6%, MoffettNathanson estimates.Bears may argue Disney lacks the leverage to negotiate such terms. But pay-TV providers themselves are projecting programming costs will rise, and it is highly unlikely that any would risk dropping ESPN. Moreover, Disney negotiates for all of its networks at once, so if ESPN looks expensive, distributors may still be getting ABC relatively cheaply.For Disney, which got about 33% of its operating income from its cable networks segment in the first six months of fiscal 2017, a solid boost in revenue could juice profits and change investor perceptions about the company. Disney got 57% of operating income from cable in 2012.At 15.9 times forward earnings estimates, Disney\u2019s shares trade below their five-year average of 17.4 times. A better outlook for ESPN could give the mouse house a makeover.Write to Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 10:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gameday-for-disney-to-boost-espn-growth-1500299241", "news_title": "Gameday for Disney to Boost ESPN Growth", "keywords": " broadcast sports, disney,espn, pay tv, sports, subscribers, walt disney,ESPN,Altice USA,ATUS,commodity,financial market news,broadcasting,cable broadcasting,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "Is Riley Sager, author of the new thriller \u201cFinal Girls,\u201d a woman?The writer\u2019s gender-neutral name won\u2019t answer the question. Neither will the author biography on the book\u2019s back flap, which avoids male or female pronouns, or the book-jacket photo, which is nonexistent. The website for the novelist features trees against a hot pink sky and the author\u2019s Instagram account includes shots of books, desserts, animals and fruity cocktails.While it isn\u2019t exactly a secret that Riley Sager is the author Todd Ritter, it is fine with him if some people assume he\u2019s female. In fact, it is good for business.Riley heads to bookshelves as male writers adopt ambiguous pseudonyms for suspense novels rooted in the inner worlds of women. Female authors like Gillian Flynn (\u201cGone Girl\u201d) and Paula Hawkins (\u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d) have been leading this booming genre in a realm dominated by women readers. The problem for men: Some fans doubt the authenticity of the female narrator\u2019s voice when it is delivered by a male author.\u201cFinal Girls,\u201d out last week, is told in the voice of a woman in her 20s who is the only survivor of a slasher-movie-style massacre. (The author\u2019s             Twitter                   avatar is a picture of Jamie Lee Curtis from the 1978 horror movie \u201cHalloween.\u201d) The first Riley Sager novel is one of five Book of the Month Club picks for July. Despite the excitement, Mr. Ritter isn\u2019t doing a book tour. Some online posts have referred to him as a woman, a mistake he sometimes ignores. He won\u2019t lie about his identity, created with help from a list of gender-neutral baby names, but he isn\u2019t trumpeting the truth, either.\u201cI didn\u2019t want there to be people thinking I was trying to deceive them in any way, but at the same time I think it\u2019s cool to have a little mystery,\u201d said Mr. Ritter, a 43-year-old author from Princeton, N.J. He said he chose the pseudonym partly because this book was unlike any other he had written and thrillers published under his real name hadn\u2019t sold well.The world has changed since the Bront\u00eb sisters and the woman born Mary Ann Evans, writing as George Eliot, had to disguise themselves with masculine-sounding pen names to be taken seriously. Women hold a large share of the power in the reading public. Last year, women bought 59% of all fiction, according to NPD Books.A 2014 Goodreads survey of 20,000 male and 20,000 female participants on the site found that of the 50 books published that year that were most read by women, 46 were written by women. (One of those was by J.K. Rowling under the pen name Robert Galbraith.)The stakes are high for male writers not to make mistakes that female readers would catch. S.J. Watson\u2014Steve Watson\u2014tried on a bra in his office while writing his 2011 best seller \u201cBefore I Go to Sleep.\u201d The book refers to the undergarment at least seven times. If he had messed up a reference to bra mechanics, he said, his mother, one of his first readers, would have told him.Pen names offer benefits, including the freedom of a clean slate. Retailers may rule out another work by an underperforming veteran in favor of a debut from a splashy newcomer. Authors who switch literary genres say readers don\u2019t like expecting one type of book while getting another.In recent years, many female readers have been drawn away from international espionage thrillers, a genre predominantly written by men, in favor of suspense novels told through the point of view of female characters, often compared with the 2012 juggernaut \u201cGone Girl.\u201d Since then, certainly, men have written psychological thrillers under their own names and women have used pen names. But once a formula is successful, publishers try to replicate it.\u201cI\u2019d be totally disingenuous if I said I haven\u2019t noticed women are the ones powering these books,\u201d said Daniel Mallory, 37, whose thriller \u201cThe Woman in the Window\u201d comes out in January under the name \u200b\u200bA.\u200b J. Finn.Mr. Mallory, vice president and executive editor at William Morrow, constructed the pseudonym using initials, like other male authors do, with help from his cousin\u2019s French bulldog, Finn. He used the name for his debut novel to steer clear of his ties in publishing and appeal to as broad an audience as possible.Authors who use pseudonyms argue that a good writer can be genuine in the voice of the opposite gender\u2014or a dog or a space creature, for that matter. And they accept that nothing stays a secret for long in the age of the internet.A quick Google search linked Tony Strong to his pen name, JP Delaney, even before his 2017 best seller \u201cThe Girl Before\u201d hit shelves. Publisher Ballantine Books identified JP Delaney as a pseudonym in the book-jacket bio but didn\u2019t use telltale pronouns like \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe.\u201dIf readers assume he\u2019s a woman, Mr. Strong said, it signals to him that he wrote a believable female narrator. \u201cAt almost every event, someone will say, \u2018Oh, I didn\u2019t realize you weren\u2019t a woman,\u2019 and I\u2019m always pleased.\u201dLast year, Amy Feld referred to author S.K. Tremayne as a woman in an online post about the 2015 thriller \u201cThe Ice Twins.\u201d Ms. Feld, 53, a child psychologist from Conshohocken, Pa., said she is more likely to pick up a first-person female narrative written by a woman. When she finds authors she likes, she reads all their books, follows them on social media and tries to develop a feel for them. When informed of S.K. Tremayne\u2019s actual gender recently, she balked. \u201cIt leads me to be suspicious of the writer,\u201d she said. \u201cI just feel a little bit lied to.\u201dSean Thomas, 53, the Londoner who is S.K. Tremayne, had been toiling for years as Tom Knox, a pen name that distanced his fiction from his work as a journalist but never delivered literary stardom. When he took on S.K. Tremayne, with what he called its \u201cslight feminine feel,\u201d his luck changed. \u201cThe Ice Twins\u201d was a 2015 international best seller printed in 30 languages and optioned for a movie.Mr. Thomas\u200b adopted the pen name on the advice of his all-female publishing team but he didn\u2019t set up social-media accounts \u200bfor it because he didn\u2019t want to flesh out the fake identity. \u201cWe didn\u2019t overtly lie,\u201d he said. \u200b\u201cIt\u2019s a cutthroat industry.\u201dWrite to Ellen Gamerman at ellen.gamerman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'These Guys Don\u2019t Care if You Think They\u2019re Women.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 10:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-guys-dont-mind-if-you-think-theyre-women-1500303376", "news_title": "These Male Authors Don\u2019t Mind if You Think They\u2019re Women", "keywords": "female authors,male authors,novelists,pseudonyms,suspense,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,page-one stories"}, {"content": "A rating firm in China is aiming to boost transparency in the country\u2019s often-murky world of corporate credit ratings.Beijing-based Dagong Global Credit Rating Co. plans to launch a digital credit-rating platform in the coming months that requires companies to submit financial information daily.\u201cWe need to limit the credit risks stemming from financial engineering and leveraging, especially among Chinese firms,\u201d said       Jianzhong Guan,        chairman of the agency. \u201cCreditors and rating agencies often don\u2019t get access to crucial information.\u201dThe push for better reporting comes at a time of increasing competition from Western rivals to play a role in China\u2019s bond market, which was valued at $9.3 trillion at the end of last year. China\u2019s central bank said this month that foreign-owned rating firms would be allowed to assess credit risks in the interbank bond market if they register with the central bank and meet certain criteria.Investors are also growing more nervous about some Chinese borrowers as Beijing cracks down on runaway debt. President       Xi Jinping       over the weekend again stressed the importance of reining in high debt levels, sparking a drop in share prices.Companies rated by Dagong will be able to enter sales and revenue data on a daily basis. An algorithm then calculates their creditworthiness and if necessary, makes changes to the rating. It focuses on a company\u2019s profitability, its debt-reduction capability and the nature of its assets, Mr. Guan said.\u201cTools like this could boost the credibility of Chinese credit-ratings firms,\u201d said Oliver Rui, a professor for finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. Currently, there is no local rating agency that asks companies to submit data on a daily basis, he said.In fact, few raters globally do anything similar, although Business Funding Research Ltd., a U.K. firm, takes data submitted in filings and adjusts risk ratings within 24 hours if warranted.Some Western competitors express doubts about the self-reporting. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether a company would provide financial information on a daily basis,\u201d said Gary Lau, managing director at             Moody\u2019s                   Investors Service Hong Kong Ltd.Moody\u2019s doesn\u2019t use an algorithm-based system, he said, adding, \u201cWe monitor rated entities on an ongoing basis.\u201dHowever, Moody\u2019s Analytics Inc., a separate unit, has since 2010 used models that can calculate ratings and default probabilities for Chinese companies, said       David Hamilton,        managing director for Asia Pacific Stress Testing and Credit Risk Analytics at Moody\u2019s Analytics. The company uses both company financial data and market data, such as changes in equity value, in its models. The analytics group doesn\u2019t have access to information that issuers share with the ratings agency, he said.For Dagong, besides defending its home turf, it is also looking to challenge the industry\u2019s leaders outside China. It has offices in Milan and Frankfurt, and is looking to add more locations, although it doesn't currently have plans to set up in London because of concerns about Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union, Mr. Guan said.He sees Chinese credit-ratings firms serving as a counterweight to Fitch Ratings Inc.,             S&P Global Inc.       and Moody\u2019s. \u201cAfter the crisis, the three Western credit-rating organizations dramatically downgraded the ratings of over two-thirds of their clients,\u201d he said. \u201cIt proved that their rating method was wrong.\u201dWestern agencies point to changes they have made since the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cThe notion that nothing has changed in this industry is pure fiction,\u201d a spokesman for Fitch Ratings said. The company said it doesn\u2019t apply ratings using algorithms.A spokesman for S&P Global said the firm in recent years has improved its ratings methodology.Like its competitors, Dagong is paid by the issuer of a bond. After the financial crisis, critics of ratings firms decried the practice, saying it can cause a conflict of interest. \u201cWe don\u2019t see this as a good solution, but it is required by the regulator,\u201d Mr. Guan said.Still, he is relying on the firms to provide accurate information\u2014a potential risk in a country such as China, where transparency is low and investors struggle to verify financial information provided by companies. \u201cThis is a huge issue in China,\u201d said Mr. Rui, at the China Europe International Business School.Mr. Guan said he trusts the information entered into the database will be correct, reasoning that the firms are mostly listed entities that he argues can\u2019t afford to provide false information.Mr. Rui said he thinks more needs to be done to improve the quality of Chinese credit ratings. \u201cThey [the Chinese agencies] tend to be over-optimistic about the firms they rate,\u201d he said.Dagong\u2019s Mr. Guan rejects the criticism. \u201cIf we discover sensitive issues or find a company incapable of repaying its debt, we will keep a very close eye on it,\u201d he said.The agency\u2019s daily credit updates could help flag whether a company is in danger of defaulting on its bonds, said Mr. Guan. At the end of March, domestic bonds from Chinese companies totaling 4.04 trillion yuan ($595.5 billion) were up for repayment within 12 months, according to Wind Info, a data provider.In recent months, defaults by Chinese companies have risen, as the government no longer prevents all of them. \u201cThey are allowing selective defaults, as long as a company does not pose a systemic risk,\u201d said Mr. Lau of Moody\u2019s.Appeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'China Rating Firm Seeks Credit Clarity.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 10:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-firm-launches-bid-to-make-credit-ratings-more-transparent-1500302833", "news_title": "Chinese Firm Launches Bid to Make Credit Ratings More Transparent", "keywords": "china bond market,china credit ratings,China's central bank,Dagong Global Credit Rating,Jianzhong Guan,corporate funding,corporate,industrial news,debt,bond markets,money,currency markets,money markets,commodity,financial market news,rating agencies,financial services"}, {"content": "Singer-songwriter Natasha Bedingfield is trying again to sell one of her Los Angeles homes\u2014this time with a higher price.The \u201cPocketful of Sunshine\u201d singer is putting her modern house in Los Feliz back on the market for $4.75 million.

Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Alex Coppola.Real estate can be a valuable alternative investment in a diversified portfolio, but access to direct investment opportunities traditionally has been restricted to accredited and institutional clients. Nonaccredited individual, or retail, investors have had access to real-estate opportunities principally through real-estate investment trusts.That is beginning to change.The Securities and Exchange Commission recently opened to retail investors access to direct investments in real estate through crowd-funding platforms. The SEC\u2019s amended Tier 1 Regulation A offering, also known as Regulation A+, allows developers to raise capital for real-estate projects through crowd-funding\u2014making public offerings to accredited and nonaccredited investors alike. The offerings must be approved by the SEC before any sales are made.Because the size of the offerings are capped at $20 million\u2014or $50 million for Tier 2 projects\u2014borrowers pay significantly lower legal and regulatory costs than they would on an S-1 filing that is used by companies that are going public. The result: Retail investors can purchase shares in specific projects for around $1,000, a price that is similar to what they would pay for shares of a mutual fund.Investments may include real-estate projects from self-storage units and retail properties to residential developments and office space. While REITs allow clients to invest in the ownership of different properties, direct investment gives them ownership in the assets themselves or in debt collateralized by those properties. That structure, as well the ability to select particular real-estate opportunities, can be appealing for many clients.There are some caveats, however. Unlike REITs, which can be traded daily like a stock, direct investments are less liquid. Depending upon the structure of the project, clients can expect to have their money tied up in an investment anywhere from one to seven years.Despite that illiquidity, an advantage of direct investments over REITs is cost. In addition to commissions, or loads, charged on the front-end of REITs, the operational costs of managing a large pool of investments can quickly erode returns. While some direct investments do charge fees, most don\u2019t include upfront fees or commissions.Navigating this relatively new process can be a challenge for advisers interested in using these investments with clients. You\u2019re looking at different fundamentals when evaluating real-estate opportunities than you are with traditional securities.But being unfamiliar shouldn\u2019t be a deterrent to exploring the opportunity. The sponsors are required to operate with full transparency, providing financials as well as information on the condition of the property, its manager, the tenants and the operating performance of ownership. Ask for investor referrals and spend time conducting due diligence on sponsors and meeting with them. They should be interested in you as well\u2014any legitimate sponsor will be looking to form a long-term relationship with you and your client.", "news_time": "2017-07-17 09:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-advisers-should-consider-new-direct-real-estate-investing-option-1500299094", "news_title": "Why Advisers Should Consider New Direct Real-Estate Investing Option", "keywords": "corporate funding,corporate,industrial news,crowdfunding,small,medium businesses,political,general news,personal finance,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "Canadian mining company             Dominion Diamond Corp.

The Korea Federation of Micro Enterprise, which mostly comprises small-business owners, said its members were \u201cworried about a sudden decline in employment, decline in service quality and possible closure due to worsened business environment.\u201dThe government is preparing financial-aid package for small companies to offset any negative effects. The finance ministry said it decided to spend some $2.66 billion to help smaller businesses cover a likely heavier financial burden and maintain employment. It also plans to offer companies more financial aid in the form of tax breaks or reducing credit-card transaction fees in the coming year.As many as 4.63 million employees, or about 24% of the salaried population\u2014including part-timers and contract workers in lower-income brackets\u2014will see their pay rise as a result of the decision, according to the commission.The 27-member independent commission, which is affiliated with the labor ministry, said it reached the decision after three months of discussions among union leaders, management representatives and academics.\u201cIt\u2019s good news for part-timers.

The country\u2019s federal minimum wage hasn\u2019t changed since 2009. Britain\u2019s minimum wage rose by \u00a30.30, to \u00a37.50 ($9.80) an hour, in April.South Korea\u2019s president has pledged to increase the minimum wage to 10,000 won, or about $8.86, by 2020.

That\u2019s the taunting question following an appellate court\u2019s decision last week to toss the conviction of former New York Assembly Speaker       Sheldon Silver       in the wake of the High Court\u2019s landmark 2016 McDonnell ruling. We think the answer is no, but prosecutors will have to follow the law better than former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara did.Readers may recall that a unanimous Supreme Court overturned the conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell because prosecutors had too broadly interpreted the meaning of a corrupt \u201cofficial act.\u201d The act couldn\u2019t merely be setting up a meeting or hosting an event, even if the politician had received personal gifts from the person who benefitted from the meeting, as Mr. McDonnell had. It must involve a formal exercise of government power and the public official must make the corrupt decision or take the action.The ruling is an important check on prosecutors who have pursued corruption cases with too little evidence and for routine constituent service. But some prosecutors warned that politicians could get away with anything short of extorting a direct bribe. They\u2019re now pointing to Silver\u2019s appellate victory as proof.Not so fast. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals didn\u2019t vacate Silver\u2019s conviction on grounds that the evidence was insufficient. Judge       Jos\u00e9 Cabranes,        one of the country\u2019s most distinguished appellate judges, explicitly wrote for the court that \u201cthe evidence presented by the Government was sufficient to prove\u201d the extortion, honest-services fraud and money-laundering counts against Silver.The evidence at trial showed that Silver had used his political influence to set up schemes to enrich himself. The most egregious involved steering mesothelioma cases to the Weitz & Luxenberg law firm for which he did little work, in return for some $3 million in referral fees. He also cadged nearly $1 million in a real-estate referral scheme. The evidence was clear and convincing, as the jury concluded.Judge Cabranes and two colleagues overturned the verdict because the instructions to the jury in the case did not \u201ccomport with McDonnell and are therefore in error.\u201d Specifically, wrote the judge, \u201cthe instructions did not convey to the jury that an official action must be a decision or action on a matter involving the formal exercise of government power akin to a lawsuit, hearing, or agency determination.\u201dThis may sound like a technicality, but accurate jury instructions are fundamental to a fair trial. And here is where Mr. Bharara\u2019s dereliction comes in. He denied responsibility for the Silver reversal because the trial occurred before McDonnell. But he knew the highly publicized McDonnell appeal was in progress, and that the Supreme Court had already targeted overbroad honest-services indictments in its 2010 Skilling decision.As Judge Cabranes writes, \u201cThe Government expressly urged the jury to convict because an official act \u2018is not limited to voting on a bill, making a speech, passing legislation, it is not limited to that,\u2019 but rather, includes \u2018any action taken or to be taken under color of official authority.\u2019 The Government thus directly argued that the District Court\u2019s instruction defining an official act was broader than the formal exercise of government power described in McDonnell.\u201d (The italics are Judge Cabranes\u2019s.)Our guess is that Mr. Bharara was only too happy to overlook a faulty jury instruction if he could get a high-profile conviction. He took a similar risk when he exceeded the limits of insider-trading law before he was slapped down by the Second Circuit in the Newman case. This is often the habit of prosecutors who want to make a political name for themselves and are celebrated in the press. See       James Comey       and Rudy Giuliani.Mr. Bharara\u2019s successor is vowing to retry Silver, but other corruption convictions may also be in jeopardy on appeal after the Second Circuit ruling. The lesson is that prosecutors have to follow the law even when their targets are unsavory politicians. As for reducing corruption, voters can help by refusing to tolerate the kind of political self-dealing that George Washington Plunkitt of Tammany Hall famously called \u201chonest graft.\u201d They can do that at the ballot box.Appeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-17 08:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-and-political-corruption-1500235304", "news_title": "Prosecutors and Political Corruption", "keywords": " bob mcdonnel, corruption, graft, preet bharara,sheldon silver, supreme court,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch,commentaries,opinions,editorials"}, {"content": "Harry Reid       may have left Washington, but the former Senate Majority Leader\u2019s legacy abides in a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals stacked with progressives ready to defend the Obama Administration\u2019s agenda. One of those judges joined a       Bill Clinton       appointee this month to salvage President Obama\u2019s methane rule with an extraordinary display of raw judicial power.Barack Obama\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency imposed the controversial rule forcing oil and gas drillers to slash methane emissions\u2014never mind that such emissions are already falling.       Scott Pruitt,        the new EPA Administrator, announced in April that the agency would reconsider the rule.One reason is that the Obama EPA included provisions in the final rule that weren\u2019t in the proposed version and thus weren\u2019t open to public comment. Mr. Pruitt also issued a 90-day stay of the rule\u2019s June 3 compliance date, and such a stay is clearly within his powers under the Clean Air Act.Six environmental groups quickly filed an emergency lawsuit with the D.C. Circuit, which Mr. Reid packed with liberal jurists after killing the Senate filibuster for appellate-court nominees. One of those judges,       Robert Wilkins,        joined Judge       David Tatel       in a 2-1 ruling that blocked the Pruitt stay with the effect of imposing the Obama policy (Clean Air Council v. Pruitt).The opinion is extraordinary for taking such action despite its acknowledgment that the court can only review \u201cfinal agency actions\u201d and that the EPA\u2019s decision to reconsider the rule is not final. The two judges nonetheless contort themselves to explain why a stay is really the same as \u201crevoking a rule\u201d\u2014and thus is final and so the court has jurisdiction.In her dissent, Judge       Janice Rogers Brown       skewered this legal creativity: \u201cIn contrast to our precedent, the Court\u2019s opinion concludes a particular administrative proceeding has innumerable final agency actions, including intermediate decisions. No authority supports this proposition.\u201dThe judges are claiming the courts are the final arbiters of when a federal agency can stay its own rules pending reconsideration. This has implications for other Obama regulations that the Trump Administration is now reviewing\u2014such as net neutrality at the Federal Communications Communication or the Education Department\u2019s gainful-employment rule for colleges.This is a sweeping new claim of judicial powers of administrative review, and it follows the pattern set by the Fourth and Ninth Circuits in their rulings blocking President Trump\u2019s immigration order. The Supreme Court unanimously rebuked those courts before it left town by allowing the order to proceed in nearly all cases until it can hear the merits in October.Mr. Pruitt can appeal to the Supreme Court, but that means waiting into next year for a ruling. He can continue his review with an eye toward reissuing a new, less-onerous methane rule, but in the interim the EPA may be obliged to enforce the Obama version. This means imposing new costs and uncertainty on businesses that would have to comply even if the rule is ultimately withdrawn.Look for a deluge of such lawsuits as progressives resort to the courts to compensate for their defeat in 2016. The D.C. Circuit\u2019s afflatus also underscores the stakes in judicial nominations and why even appellate courts have become political battlegrounds. We\u2019re in dangerous political territory when judges appear to join the anti-Trump resistance on such flimsy legal grounds.Appeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'The D.C.

Some ran into an issue with their earlier video initiatives: consumers, who have all the choice in the world when it comes to online viewing, didn\u2019t care for magazine brands\u2019 video hubs. Time Inc.\u2019s video destination Daily Cut is in the process of being closed, for example, and Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s video hub the Scene pivoted to distributing content on Facebook.--The case for video--Ad buyers will tell you that when it comes to video, there simply isn\u2019t enough quality inventory online. Publishers can charge high rates for their \u201cbrand safe\u201d environments; and, because they own the intellectual property around their content, they can make extra money through licensing deals (as Cond\u00e9 Nast did when it sold \u201cLast Chance U\u201d to Netflix.) The problem, though, is that consumers don\u2019t always associate magazine brands with a sit-back watching experience. Publishers need to balance monetizing content within their own branded houses on the one hand, and carefully selecting distribution partners with the other. On a related note, Digiday has a detailed article on the rise of Amazon\u2019s Video Direct platform, which offers publishers yet another destination to place their videos (and, in some cases, earn a lot more than they can on YouTube).The New York Times\u2019 Sapna Maheshwari has an amusing article on how Gillette\u2019s long-running \u201cwelcome to manhood\u201d promotion to mail razors to men to celebrate their 18th birthdays keeps accidentally sending packages out to women, or men far beyond their teenage years. Procter & Gamble-owned Gillette wouldn\u2019t provide details on where it got its mailing list data from, but a support page says the company uses sign-ups from its websites, opt-ins from retailers and other \u201ccommercially available sources.\u201d A Gillette spokeswoman said the number of mistakes have been \u201cvery small.\u201d Nonetheless, the muddle highlights the difficulty for CPG brands to maintain accurate databases when they don\u2019t have a strong one-to-one relationship with their consumers.--How to Trian Your Dragon--You know what isn\u2019t a laughing matter for P&G?

The new iPhone\u2019s starting price could be more than $1,000, which is an eye-watering amount for a product that consumers generally upgrade after just a couple of years. Added to the mix is that arch-rival Samsung has turned the tables recently by building phones that have made bigger design leaps than the iPhone\u2019s iterative updates. \u201cFor Apple to outdo Samsung on design, analysts said, it would need a new distinguishing feature, like a fingerprint sensor beneath the display rather than a physical home button,\u201d another WSJ article explains. Apple will have to up the ante on marketing to persuade old and new consumers alike that the iPhone should be their No.1 choice.Who will be the gatekeepers of wireless in five years?

Such hand-tracking could be essential to the success of virtual and augmented reality headsets, which can be awkward to use with traditional hand-held controllers.Leap Motion said on Monday it raised $50 million in Series C funding led by clients advised by J.P. Morgan Asset Management Group. Previous investors Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, Highland Capital Partners and SOSventures International also participated.The company has raised more than $90 million to date and declined to disclose its valuation. The funding round closed in December 2016, but Leap Motion did not disclose it until now due to strategic reasons.Leap Motion is not alone in its pursuit of hand-tracking. Publicly traded technology companies are betting heavily on virtual and augmented technology and investing in it.             Facebook Inc.\u2019s       Oculus VR acquired Israel-based gesture-control company Pebbles Ltd. for about $60 million in 2015.             Apple Inc.       filed a patent for 3-D hand-tracking in 2016.             Microsoft Corp.\u2019s       researchers have also presented research on detailed hand tracking.Other venture-backed startups, including uSens Inc., are also developing similar technology.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say who a leader is in such a new market,\u201d             Gartner Inc.       analyst       Tuong Nguyen       said.Leap Motion, which was founded in 2010, says it has been working on hand-tracking for much longer than most of its competition. The company generates revenue through licensing its software to virtual reality headset makers, through industrial use cases and through its reference designs.Mr. Nguyen said hands gestures are one of multiple ways people will interface with augmented and virtual reality goggles. Such devices will have \u201cmulti-modal inputs\u201d that people will use differently based on the situation, he said. In some situations people might use their voice or their eyes to control the device.\u201cWhen you look at hand-tracking, it will be one component that is used where appropriate,\u201d Mr. Nguyen said.In a converted warehouse in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood, the company demonstrated how its camera sensors detect and capture hand movements, down to the wiggle of a finger. The company uses a small camera to capture hand movements, and builds a virtual skeleton of the hand.Wearing a virtual reality headset with a Leap Motion sensor mounted on it, users can pick up virtual objects, move them and even throw them -- all by moving their hands. The sensor that Leap Motion manufactures is so small that it could be used with mobile virtual reality headsets, which are powered by smartphones.Leap Motion does not make its own virtual reality headsets, but it is partnering with headset makers like             Qualcomm Inc.Virtual reality headsets have seen a rocky start with consumers. Facebook Inc. recently cut the price of its Oculus Rift for the second time in 2017. Research firm IDC estimates the device has sold about 520,000 units world-wide to date, compared with 770,000 of HTC\u2019s Vive headsets and 1.6 million PlayStation VR headsets.Leap Motion Chief Executive       Michael Buckwald       said Leap Motion\u2019s hand-tracking could bolster virtual reality\u2019s appeal. If experiences are optimized around fingers -- rather than bulky controllers or buttons on a headset -- they will feel magical and more accessible, he said.\u201cThings like controllers and lack of movement have robbed people of the final part of the experience that is the difference between a Palm Pilot and an iPhone,\u201d he said.", "news_time": "2017-07-17 07:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/leap-motion-grabs-50-million-for-hand-tracking-computer-interface-1500291001", "news_title": "Leap Motion Grabs $50 Million for Hand-Tracking Computer Interface ", "keywords": "Highland Capital Partners,Leap Motion,Andreessen Horowitz,uSens,Pebbles,Michael Buckwald,Tuong Nguyen,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities,technology,venture capital,virtual reality technologies"}, {"content": "Good morning,The Republican push to pass a sweeping health-care law was set back again as Senate leaders said they would delay a vote planned for this week while Sen.

His 6-3, 6-1, 6-4 dismissal of an injured and tearful Cilic was his eighth men\u2019s singles title at Wimbledon, topping his teenage idol Pete Sampras\u2019s record.

Markets are jittery about which part of the system regulators will go after.Chinese authorities spent the weekend at the National Financial Work Conference considering risks plaguing the financial system. Fear permeated markets, which tumbled Monday after President Xi Jinping gave a speech that supported efforts to tamp down complicated lending along with other financial-system risks. Frightened investors\u2014seeing room for yet more policy tightening after cheery GDP growth data\u2014are now searching for signs of the regulators\u2019 next hit.At hand is an ever-growing asset-management industry\u2014now around 60 trillion yuan ($8.8 trillion)\u2014and the deepening nexus of banks, brokers, trusts and insurance companies. The central bank elaborated on the linkages it uncovered in the asset-management industry in its recently published financial-stability report. That is likely telling of where regulators will go digging.Untangling the asset-management industry\u2019s ties will be painful. Banks have sold more than one-third of the wealth-management-product assets. These products are then further packaged and sold off to trusts, brokers and funds to be managed.For instance, per central-bank data, more than 17 trillion yuan of assets have been unloaded to trusts. Banks have used another 18 trillion yuan of separate asset-management plans to take credit assets\u2014like loans and bonds\u2014off their balance sheets. Wealth-management products\u2014most of which are off-balance sheet\u2014are equal to 20% of total assets of listed banks, on average, according to Nomura.If regulators do take on the asset-management business, it could spell trouble for corporate borrowers. Corporate bonds account for more than 40% of underlying assets in wealth-management products sold by banks. Asset managers have been the only active buyers of these bonds so far this year. These bonds are already primed for a selloff: the leverage ratio in asset managers\u2019 bond-market positions has risen to 1.4 times in the past month from 1.25.Given the complexity of the system, regulatory disruption is likely to be painful.Write to Anjani Trivedi at anjani.trivedi@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 06:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-gets-hit-next-in-chinas-financial-crackdown-1500288486", "news_title": "Who Gets Hit Next in China\u2019s Financial Crackdown?

Operators starting with             J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc.        JBHT -0.34%       this week will begin reporting on second-quarter earnings, and WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Jennifer Smith writes that analysts already are raising volume and profit outlooks as shipping demand looks to be strengthening. Strong import results from ports last month, robust grain harvests and more demand tied to online sales are fueling the optimism, along with signs that the trucking business may be seeing some movement in long-stagnant freight rates. New reports like one last week from DAT Solutions LLC suggest demand is outstripping capacity in the truckload sector, livening up that market and likely triggering changes in shipping volumes and profitability in businesses from freight brokers to intermodal operations. The big question for truckload and less-than-truckload carriers is whether an apparent upturn in the second quarter means that business really is moving into the fast lane through the rest of the year.Precision railroading leaves no time for sleeping on the job, as far as Hunter Harrison is concerned. The             CSX Corp.       chief executive who took over in March promising to quickly jolt the company\u2019s culture has taken one high-profile step by dropping a longtime policy that allowed train conductors and engineers to nap for up to 45 minutes. That puts CSX on a freight rail fault line between scheduling and safety, the WSJ\u2019s Paul Ziobro reports, and at odds with its U.S. rivals, which allow napping under certain conditions. The action revives questions of fatigue and safety that arise in transport operations, including trucking and aviation. Rail unions don\u2019t like the CSX move, but the carrier says it\u2019s getting improvements that help its customers and employees. CSX\u2019s trains are moving 10% faster and spending 7% less time in terminals. And the railroad says that\u2019s given workers more time to rest before or after their shifts.China is taking major actions in farm production that could plant seeds of opportunity for U.S. agriculture exporters. Beijing has been rolling back price supports and the stockpiling of grains and other farm goods, the WSJ\u2019s Lucy Craymer reports, causing production of key staples to fall and potentially providing a boon to foreign producers of cotton, soybeans, corn and sugar. The steep shifts in commodities markets highlights the impact China\u2019s enormous scale has had on the prices of agriculture prices: China\u2019s foreign purchases of soybeans have grown 29% since the country removed a price floor, and that helped push global prices up last year amid a glut in other grains. The market effects could grow as China works through its big stockpiles and turns to imports to fill the gap between production and domestic demand. That has exporters abroad looking to ship in more goods\u2014and raises the stakes for U.S. Midwest farmers in the increasingly tense trade relations between China and the U.S.Apple Inc.\u2019s       supply chain for its newest iPhone appears to be running true to form, with the electronics giant scrambling to get the device done and delivered. Leaks and reports suggest Apple is facing challenges aligning parts and design of the new phone, the WSJ\u2019s       Dan Gallagher       reports, complicating the production schedule and analyst hopes for a boost in revenue this fall. The problem comes in the gap between Apple\u2019s famously forward-looking design shop and the company\u2019s highly-lauded management of its global supply chain. In this case, Apple is reportedly working on a new iPhone model that has faced shortages of key components, including the display known as an Organic Light Emitting Diode. Analysts say Apple also will need to order the chips needed for new features by next month to manufacture the devices ahead of the holidays. The new phone is rumored to be more expensive than previous iPhones, and it\u2019s already coming at a cost to Apple\u2019s supply chain.The production pipeline for new aircraft may be changing. Efforts are underway in China and Russia to challenge the grip that             Boeing Co.       and             Airbus Group SE                   hold on the jet market, as Canada\u2019s             Bombardier Inc.       begins rolling out its narrow-body passenger jet the C300. Big-jet supply chains won\u2019t shift for several years, the WSJ\u2019s Robert Wall reports, but the growing development adds new and unfamiliar pressure on Airbus and Boeing as the plane makers contend with waning demand for their bigger long-haul jets. The narrow-body market has been the industry\u2019s sweet spot for years, and China\u2019s state-owned jet maker, Comac, has secured orders for 500 of its single-aisle C919 planes. Most of those are within China, but that will help the manufacturer scale up production of both the jets and the replacement parts that are critical to wider use of the planes. Russia has more established aircraft industry, and the younger             Irkut Corp.       hopes it can gain traction that long eluded older manufacturers.\u2018Moving into 2018, you got to believe that at some point truckload rates may improve, even if just slightly.\u2019Year-over-year growth in sales by U.S. nonstore retailers, mostly online sales, in the first half of 2017 against a 4.2% decline at department stores.China\u2019s economic growth in the second quarter matched the 6.9% expansion in the first.

In contrast, Flydubai offers a no-frills service that connects cities using smaller planes. More closely integrating its schedule with Flydubai would allow Emirates to offer access to cities that don\u2019t warrant use of big planes, feeding passengers to and from those destinations to long-haul flights via its Dubai hub to help fill the large planes flying to the U.S., Europe, and Asia.Emirates and Flydubai said the new partnership should allow them to \u201dleverage each other\u2019s network to scale up their operations and accelerate growth.\u201d Jointly, the two airlines aim to offer 240 destinations by 2022, up from 216 now, using a combined fleet of 380 aircraft.The Emirates-Flydubai partnership agreement comes at a difficult time for the Middle Eastern carriers.After a period of rapid growth, Emirates and its two major regional rivals Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways are facing a prolonged period of turbulence. Low oil prices have hit business travel to and from their home bases while an oversupply of seats has put downward pressure on ticket prices.Tougher travel-security measures in response to the threat of terror attacks and uncertainty surrounding travel to the U.S. have also weakened demand. More recently, a diplomatic standoff between Qatar and its neighbors including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates\u2014Dubai is one of the U.A.E.\u2019s seven emirates\u2014has added extra uncertainty to the region\u2019s aviation sector.The disruption was visible in the latest results from Emirates. The carrier reported an 82% drop in net profit to $340 million for the fiscal year to end-March compared with the previous 12 months.Though Emirates and Flydubai are owned by Dubai\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund and operate from the same international airport, they have functioned independently and will continue to do so under separate management teams, according to the airlines\u2019 statement.\u201c[T]his new partnership will unlock the immense value that the complementary models of both companies can bring to consumers, each airline, and to Dubai,\u201d said       Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed       Al Maktoum, the Dubai official who is chairman of both companies and heads the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority.Emirates, which was founded in 1985, became one of the most prolific buyers of widebody planes from Airbus and Boeing in creating a global network from its hub in Dubai. The airline, which today has a fleet of 259 aircraft, is known for its lavish offerings in first and business class such as showers and fine wines.Flydubai was set up in 2008 with the aim of mirroring the success of budget airlines such as             Southwest Airlines Co.       in the U.S. and             Ryanair Holdings                   PLC in Europe. The airline operates a fleet of 58 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and will take delivery of more than 100 aircraft by the end of 2023.\u201cGiven the competitive yield pressure Emirates has faced due to falling prices and increased airline competition, Emirates can leverage the strength of Flydubai\u2019s network and dispense the need to buy their own [narrow-body planes],\u201d said       Saj Ahmad,        chief analyst at StrategicAero Research. \u201c[And] vice versa, Flydubai can offer flights on Emirates\u2019 network and without buying widebodies,\u201d he said.Emirates and Flydubai said they are working out the commercial, logistical, and technical details of the partnership which would be put in place over the coming months, with the code-sharing agreement starting in the final quarter of 2017.\u2014Robert Wall in London contributed to this article.Write to Nicolas Parasie at nicolas.parasie@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 06:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/emirates-flydubai-connect-in-new-middle-east-airline-alliance-1500285715", "news_title": "Emirates, Flydubai Connect in New Middle East Airline Alliance ", "keywords": " airline partnerships,airlines, dubai, dubai hub, emirates airline, emirates flydubai partnership,emirates ties up with flydubai, gulf carriers, qatar embargo, u.a.e.,Emirates Airline,Flydubai,Boeing,BA,Dubai Civil Aviation Authority,plans,strategy,ownership changes,joint ventures,consortia,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,partnerships,collaborations,political,general news,national,public security,international relations,politics,state security measures,policies,aerospace products,parts,civil aircraft,scheduled passenger airlines,aerospace,defense,air transport,industrial goods,low cost airlines,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "New York City Councilman David Greenfield of Brooklyn says he won\u2019t seek re-election this year.The decision by Mr. Greenfield, a Democrat and one of the city\u2019s most influential lawmakers, came as a surprise to many at City Hall.

MSFT 0.76%       and             Host Hotels & Resorts Inc.       are among a growing number of companies boosting contributions to 401(k) plans because some workers aren\u2019t saving enough, a move many firms have long resisted because of the costs.The average company contribution to 401(k) plans rose to an estimated 4.7% of employee salaries in 2016, up from 3.9% in 2015, according to data on 1,900 workplace retirement savings plans run by mutual-fund company Vanguard Group. It was the highest percentage and biggest year-to-year jump since at least 2007.Some companies in certain industries say they need to spend more to retain the best employees and motivate staff. They also need to ensure that older, relatively expensive workers can afford to retire on time and make way for younger staff, retirement specialists said. Employees who don\u2019t have adequate nest eggs will stay in their jobs longer and add to a company\u2019s overall health-care costs.The boost in contributions represents a policy shift for American companies that embraced tax-deferred 401(k) plans partly because the savings tool allowed them to shift the burden of paying for retirement to employees. Many shed more expensive defined-benefit pension plans that guaranteed employees a certain percentage of their salary in retirement.Companies tried to encourage more 401(k) savings over the past decade by automatically enrolling workers in the plans and boosting the amount employees set aside each year unless they opted out.But many U.S. workers still aren\u2019t saving enough on their own. The average\u00a0percentage they set aside\u00a0among\u00a0Vanguard-run retirement accounts has dropped since 2007 largely because more new 401(k) savers were enrolled at lower initial savings rates. The average total employee and company contributions to workplace savings plans among workers who participate, as a result, haven\u2019t moved above 11% of salaries for at least a decade.Many retirement plan advisers say employees need to save about 15% of their salaries each year. Workers can save that sum using their 401(k) and other tools like individual retirement accounts.\u201cIf you want people to retire at a certain time they need to have acquired sufficient assets,\u201d said       Jean Young,        a senior research analyst at the Vanguard Center for Investor Research. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing interest among some employers in supporting that dynamic,\u201d with more money.The added contributions by some companies to their 401(k)s are a change from the depths of the financial crisis when many employers suspended or pared back contributions. The prolonged economic recovery in the years since has put many companies on more stable footing.A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored plan that allows workers to contribute part of their pretax pay up to certain federal limits. That money typically isn\u2019t taxed until it is withdrawn, and participants generally pick from a list of funds and investment options. Companies aren\u2019t required to make their own contributions to employee accounts, but some companies agree to match a portion of what workers chip in. These accounts rise and fall with financial markets.Some firms are using more generous 401(k) contributions to help attract and retain talent, said       Aimee DeCamillo,        head of retirement plan services at             T. Rowe Price Group Inc.Ultimate Software Group Inc.       steadily increased the company match for its $281 million 401(k) plan in recent years as it met new revenue targets. In January 2016, the Weston, Fla.-based company pushed its match to 40% of any employee contribution up to federal limits for its roughly 3,700 workers, up from 35%.Another company that recently contributed more money, Host Hotels,\u00a0said it hadn\u2019t done\u00a0enough to get employees to the savings rate many advisers recommended.\u201cWe weren\u2019t getting people to the 15%\u201d contribution level retirement advisers recommend, said       Karen Montague,        director of total rewards at Host Hotels, a real-estate investment trust that owns properties run by big hotel chains such as Hilton Worldwide and             Marriott International Inc.So in April Host increased its company match and now chips in 50 cents of every dollar its 220 employees invest in its 401(k) plan, up to 8% of their salary, an increase from the previous 6% limit.Host also has a discretionary system that matches as much as an additional 4% of salary each year, up from 3% before the change.The change to Host\u2019s matches means the company is likely to contribute an additional $250,000 to the plan, based on 2016 contribution data. Increasing the discretionary component could result in another $300,000 a year, the plan\u2019s administrator said.In Seattle, Microsoft tried to change employee behavior before increasing its own contributions. Roughly three years ago it increased the salary amounts workers pick to contribute when they sign up for a 401(k). Workers now choose from the options of 8%, 10% or 12%, as compared with 6%, 8% or 10%.Last year Microsoft offered more money to the more than 60,000 current employees in its 401(k) plan. Instead of chipping in half of up to 6% of each worker\u2019s salary, the firm started matching half of all employee contributions up to federal limits. The government limits employee contributions and sets an overall limit on the amount channeled into an individual\u2019s plan.As a result of that change the company contributed roughly $150 million more to its $17 billion retirement savings plan last year.\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer to try and max that out as much as possible,\u201d said       Francois Burianek,        a 43-year-old senior software engineer for Microsoft\u2019s Xbox gaming unit, who raised his 401(k) contributions by more than 70%.After one year of the increased match, 52% of Microsoft workers had maximized the amount of pretax money they contributed to the plan, up from 36% in 2015, the company said.

But it infuriated conservatives who see the taxes as a drag on economic growth and view removing them as an important part of repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\u201cThey\u2019re all wusses,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, the CNBC economic commentator. \u201cHow is it possible after all these years of studying the capital-gains tax? How is it possible that they don\u2019t know that [cutting] it promotes growth?\u201dThe party\u2019s longstanding focus on lowering marginal tax rates to spur investment and growth is colliding with some members\u2019 concerns about the merits and politics of cutting taxes for businesses and high-income households while proposing other policies, in this case on health care, that could place a greater financial burden on low-income households.The challenge could re-emerge when the party moves on later this year to an effort to rewrite U.S. tax law.\u201cI thought it important that we recognize that if we\u2019re offering the benefit that we should also try to offer a revenue source and that\u2019s part of the responsibility that we\u2019ve got,\u201d Mr. Rounds said. \u201cI know it\u2019s still a burden on them, but it\u2019s not near the burden on [high-income households] as would be to individuals in that $0-to-$36,000 pay range.\u201dIndependent estimates of the blueprints from House Republicans and President       Donald Trump\u2019s       administration show the bulk of benefits from their plans accrue to the top of the income ladder, though no plans are final and the GOP president has promised a middle-class tax cut.At some level, health care may be a unique case, with policy boundaries set by the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, and the potentially visceral reaction to tax cuts twinned with coverage losses.But the retention of the 2010 law\u2019s taxes may indicate the emergence of a Republicanism that, while not favoring tax increases, is less comfortable with focusing tax cuts on high-income households. Mr. Trump has occasionally flirted with populist rhetoric on tax policy, and his campaign last year resonated in some areas of the country struggling with economic decline.The past week shows \u201cthe waning power of the supply side, pro-growth antitax wing of the Republican Party,\u201d said James Pethokoukis, a columnist and blogger at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. It is \u201ca moving away from the more extreme tax-cut positions.\u201dThe two ACA taxes in question each affect fewer than 3% of households. Republicans opposed the taxes along with the rest of the health law, but the law\u2019s core structure\u2014tax increases at the top used to pay for broader health-insurance coverage\u2014meant that undoing the taxes would lead to the reverse.To most House Republicans, that wasn\u2019t a problem. The tax increases, they argued, were holding the economy back, so repeal would be an economic boon. Their bill repealed the investment tax retroactively for 2017 and ended the 0.9% payroll tax in 2023.\u201cI\u2019m much more concerned about us keeping our word, and we said we were going to get rid of Obamacare,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio).That idea fell flat in the Senate for several reasons. One is the slim margin, where any three Republican senators can band together to kill an idea, assuming there is no Democratic support. A second is the rule allowing unlimited amendments on reconciliation bills that avoid a filibuster. That means Democrats could force politically tough votes, such as retaining the investment tax and using the money to help near-retirees afford health care.\u201cIt shows how incredibly unpopular cutting taxes for the wealthy is and how powerfully that criticism has broken through and I think affected how some senators seem to be viewing this bill,\u201d said       Harry Stein,        director of fiscal policy at the Center for American Progress, a think tank aligned with Democrats.Few, if any, House Republicans have ruled out voting for the Senate bill because it doesn\u2019t repeal the taxes.Instead, the pressure would transfer to the tax bill. Republicans had assumed they would have already accomplished a big piece of their tax-cutting agenda in the health bill. Now, that task is harder. Removing the Obamacare taxes could require finding money elsewhere, or the taxes could just remain in place.\u201cWe\u2019d have to find the offsets in another place, be flexible and try to find another place,\u201d said Rep. Kenny Marchant (R., Texas). \u201cAnd the people in the other place might not be happy about it.\u201dHouse Republicans have said repeatedly that they aren\u2019t particularly concerned about how their plan changes the tax burden for different income groups, saying their main aim is to generate broad economic growth.\u201cMy fixation is what maximizes economic growth for everyone,\u201d said Rep. David Schweikert (R., Ariz.), who added: \u201cWe\u2019re in real, real trouble if we don\u2019t get some dramatic economic growth.\u201dThe Senate\u2019s experience on health care suggests that those distinctions between income groups will matter politically and legislatively, and some House Republicans are making their tax plan with that dynamic in mind.\u201cBenefits like the mortgage interest deduction should be more targeted to help lower and middle income people as opposed to wealthier Americans,\u201d said Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R., Fla.). \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a balance in our tax reform package.\u201dWrite to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-law-taxes-divide-the-gop-signaling-a-shift-1500283800", "news_title": "GOP Splits Over Health-Law Taxes, Signaling a Shift", "keywords": "government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "CULIAC\u00c1N, Mexico\u2014The extradition of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, Mexico\u2019s long-dominant drug lord, has led to an explosion of violence in his home state of Sinaloa, the birthplace of the country\u2019s narcotics industry.Rival factions are fighting over Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s billion-dollar empire as he awaits trial in solitary confinement inside a high-security prison in New York.

One measure suggests investors should think twice.The yield on the       Bloomberg Barclays       global high-yield corporate bond index stands at just over 5%, not far from its record 2014 low of 4.7%. But what really matters is the extra yield\u2014or spread\u2014that investors pick up versus other, safer asset classes like government bonds. At first glance, that looks relatively chunky: a five-year U.S. Treasury yields 1.8%, for instance.But it\u2019s worth looking again. Strategists at Prudential Portfolio Management Group, part of the U.K.\u2019s         Prudential PLC,       break it down like this: First, there are always going to be some high-yield companies that default, even if the economy is OK. So PPMG shaves off some of the extra yield to account for long-run average losses due to defaults.Then, the strategists deduct the spread available on safer investment-grade corporate bonds. After all, if an investor can achieve the same yield pickup by buying a less risky security, it would make sense to do so.On that basis, the risk premia on high-yield bonds in the U.S. and Europe were negative in June, PPMG calculates. The extra yield wasn\u2019t enough to compensate investors for the risk of owning them over time.This has happened before, most recently in 2014. That was followed by a selloff that gathered pace in 2015 as the falling oil price hit energy-company balance sheets, most notably in the U.S. There may not be an immediate catalyst for the market to fall now.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said the effort is a step toward improving relations between the Koreas and easing regional tensions.\u201cWe hope the two sides will move in a positive direction to create the conditions to break the stalemate and relaunch dialogue and negotiations,\u201d the spokesman,       Lu Kang,        said at a media briefing in Beijing.The dual proposals on Monday underscore Mr. Moon\u2019s commitment to seeking engagement with Pyongyang as a way to lower tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Moon, a liberal who favors dialogue with North Korea, was sworn into office in May following the impeachment and removal of his conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye.Mr. Moon\u2019s more dovish stance contrasts with the approach of U.S. President       Donald Trump,        who has ramped up tough language against North Korea since coming to office and threatened \u201csome pretty severe things\u201d in response to the regime\u2019s weapons tests.A U.S. Embassy official said Monday the U.S. continues to coordinate closely with Seoul on North Korea.Since Mr. Moon\u2019s inauguration, North Korea has tested a series of missiles with new capabilities and earlier this month test-launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching parts of the U.S.Even while condemning the North\u2019s missile test and ordering a joint missile-launch drill with the U.S. on the Korean Peninsula the following day, Mr. Moon hasn\u2019t given up on dialogue.Just days after North Korea\u2019s July 4 ICBM test-launch, Mr. Moon delivered a speech in Berlin calling for greater rapprochement with North Korea, including the proposals that were formally made on Monday.In the speech, Mr. Moon also called for a summit meeting with North Korean leader       Kim Jong Un       \u201cat any time, at any place,\u201d providing certain conditions were met. He has also called for cooperation between the two Koreas at the Winter Olympics next year, which will be hosted by South Korea.During the Berlin speech, Mr. Moon said he had secured Mr. Trump\u2019s support for Seoul to take the initiative in reopening inter-Korean dialogue following their White House summit meeting late last month.Over the weekend, North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper dismissed Mr. Moon\u2019s Berlin speech as \u201cnonsensical sophism putting a brake on the efforts for achieving peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201dThe speech\u2019s \u201coverall contents are run through with an ill intention to escalate confrontation with the compatriots in the north and stifle them with the backing of outsiders,\u201d the Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency.Earlier this month, North Korea chastised Mr. Moon for condemning, rather than celebrating, Pyongyang\u2019s ICBM test-launch.North Korea also rejected an earlier offer by the Moon administration to restart family reunions, demanding that the South first agree to turn over a group of North Korean restaurant workers who defected to Seoul last year.

The market seems delighted at the prospect of a Buffett link: Sprint\u2019s shares jumped 4% Friday.But renting the Buffett name isn\u2019t cheap.When Berkshire invested $3 billion to help finance Burger King\u2019s purchase of Tim Hortons in 2014, it got preferred shares with a 9% coupon and warrants that convert into 1.75% of the company. The year before, when it put up $8 billion to join with private-equity firm 3G to take Heinz private, it likewise got preferred shares with 9% coupon. For companies more desperate for Mr. Buffett\u2019s cash and reputation, the price could be steeper. Berkshire earned 10% per annum on its postcrisis investment in             Goldman Sachs,       and also got warrants that allow it to buy shares at discount.Ultimately, what\u2019s most important for Mr. Son is that any investment allow SoftBank to shrug off its Sprint burden, which could free it to focus on its $93 billion Vision Fund, the world\u2019s largest tech fund.

That was in stark contrast to the last meeting of the National Financial Work Conference five years ago, which advocated reforms that would bring China\u2019s markets more in line with global peers.Chinese investors interpreted the stern tone as signaling that a regulatory push in recent months to reduce risk and leverage in financial markets will continue full force, prompting a selloff in the country\u2019s equity markets\u2014particularly the Shenzhen Stock Exchange known for its smaller, more speculation-prone stocks.The Nasdaq-style ChiNext startup board finished the day down 5.1%. The Shenzhen Composite Index closed down 4.3%, after falling 4.5% earlier. The bigger Shanghai market, where large state-run companies are listed, narrowed its losses to 1.4% after falling as much as 2.5% shortly after the opening bell.All three indexes posted the sharpest drops since Dec. 12, 2016, data from FactSet showed.The selloff came despite faster-than-expected growth in the Chinese economy in the second quarter, as investors said the strong economic performance would give Beijing more leeway to tighten policies.Meanwhile, China\u2019s central bank injected a net 140 billion yuan ($20.64 billion) into the financial system on Monday morning, the largest such supply of cash in nearly six weeks. Analysts said the move was aimed at pre-empting panic among investors.The big injection \u201csuggests that the PBOC was in a way prepared for such market volatility and it was trying to manage people\u2019s expectations,\u201d said       Zang Min,        senior fixed income analyst at Hongxin Securities.The injection may have helped fend off jitters in China\u2019s bond market, which has seen yields spike briefly in recent months during Beijing\u2019s crackdown on leveraged investment. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Chinese government bond fell 0.01 percentage point to 3.56%.A steady Chinese yuan also helped appease some investors, analysts said. The People\u2019s Bank of China, which sets a daily \u201cfix\u201d--or reference rate for the band in which the yuan can trade\u2014on Monday set that rate at 6.7562, its highest level against the U.S. dollar since early November.\u201cThe yuan\u2019s fix is near the high end of our expectations, which also shows the PBOC\u2019s intention to stabilize markets,\u201d said a Shanghai-based senior currency trader at a Chinese bank.Chinese equity markets were also weighed down by President Xi\u2019s call at the weekend conference for boosting the role of so-called \u201cdirect financing,\u201d or fundraising via the bond and stock markets, analysts said. Chinese regulators have been approving new stock listings at a fast pace in recent months, in an attempt to alleviate a yearslong backlog of companies waiting to go public.While that is good for companies that want to list, some investors have complained that the influx of new listings is depressing the markets, particularly in Shenzhen where new listings have concentrated in recent years.\u201cThis means the speed of approval for initial public offerings won\u2019t slow,\u201d said       Amy Lin,        senior analyst at Capital Securities.In the first half of this year, 237 companies listed in China\u2019s domestic stock markets, raising a combined 116.6 billion yuan ($17.19 billion), nearly triple the amount raised a year earlier, according to China\u2019s securities regulator.\u2014Yifan Xie in Shanghai and Gregor Stuart Hunter in Hong Kong contributed to this article.Write to Shen Hong at hong.shen@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'Beijing Talks Tough, and Stocks Fall.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 04:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/xi-jinpings-comments-spook-chinese-stock-markets-1500281053", "news_title": "Xi Jinping\u2019s Comments Spook Chinese Stock Markets", "keywords": "china financial work conference ,china national financial work conference,china shares,china stock market plunge,china stock markets,china stocks,chinext,national financial work conference,shanghai composite index,shenzhen composite index, Xi Jinping,Amy Lin, Zang Min,government finance,economic news,equity markets,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014Uber Technologies Inc. said it is suspending its operations in the Chinese gambling hub of Macau, the latest retreat for the ride-sharing giant as it continues to face regulatory pressure from many overseas markets.On its website, Uber said it is temporarily halting ride sharing in the partly autonomous southern Chinese city near Hong Kong. The company said it was \u201cnot able to secure a business environment\u201d to continue operating. Though the city has a population of less than 650,000, the gambling and entertainment hub is a magnet for tourists from mainland China and elsewhere, with tourist arrivals topping 30 million last year.The withdrawal, even from a small market, is another setback for Uber overseas, where it has faced regulatory headwinds from local governments and fierce competition from homegrown ride-sharing startups.\u00a0 The company is also seeking to right itself after the resignation of CEO Travis Kalanick last month amid a wave of controversies about its work culture.Last week, Uber announced it was pulling out of Russia, saying it was combining operations with Yandex.Taxi, the most popular ride-hailing service there. And earlier this year it appeared ready to withdraw from Taiwan amid a dispute over the legality of its services, though it resumed ride sharing after reaching an agreement with the government.In 2016 Uber retreated from mainland China by giving up its operations there in exchange for a minority stake in the country\u2019s homegrown ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing Technology Co.Uber\u2019s suspension in Macau is the latest twist for the ride-sharing company on the former Portuguese colony.

However, economists said rising financing costs and some cooling in the property market are expected to weigh down growth in the year\u2019s second half.China\u2019s growth data released Monday by the National Bureau of Statistics came in above a forecast for 6.8% growth by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.On a quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted basis, gross domestic product expanded 1.7%, the bureau said, compared with growth of 1.3% in the first quarter, suggesting that momentum in the economy may be even stronger than the year-over-year figure indicates.At a high-level financial conference this past weekend, President       Xi Jinping       made clear that the regulatory tightening would continue apace.Robust overseas shipments, reflecting renewed strength in the global economy, and solid consumption at home helped offset a slowdown in investment.The latest result leaves little doubt that China will meet its annual growth target of \u201cabout 6.5%,\u201d though economists said they expect some deceleration during the rest of the year.\u201cThough the Chinese economy was holding up better than expected in the first half of the year, a slowdown is kind of inevitable,\u201d said Zhou Hao, an economist with             Commerzbank AG      .There are also doubts about how accurately the data reflects actual momentum in the economy. China said Friday it was revising the way it measures GDP to better align its data with international standards, adding the health-care, tourism and \u201cnew, emerging economy\u201d industries to its calculations.The statistics bureau said Monday the change didn\u2019t affect second-quarter growth data as the revisions will take some time to implement.Chen Xiaohui, a sales manager at Foshan Top Furniture Co., a private company based in Guangdong province, said that her company received more orders\u2014especially from the overseas market\u2014this year but that rising operating costs at home were squeezing profitability.\u201cOur factory has been running at full capacity all the time this year, but that doesn\u2019t mean our profits are improving because costs\u2014raw materials and labor\u2014have been rising rapidly,\u201d she said.The latest monthly industrial production and retail sales figures, also released Monday, largely tallied with the GDP data. Industrial output rose 7.6% in June from a year earlier, coming in above both May\u2019s 6.5% gain and market expectations. Retail sales grew by 11.0% in June from a year earlier, accelerating from the previous month\u2019s 10.7% and also beating forecasts. Fixed-asset investment in nonrural areas of China climbed 8.6% year over year in the first six months of 2017, matching the increase in the January-May period but exceeding economists\u2019 expectations.A deceleration in property investment was an indication that still-robust housing sales might lose steam later this year. Large developers have pulled back on new construction as credit becomes harder to come by and local governments set restrictions on property purchases. The property sector accounts for about a third of overall GDP.\u201cThe slowdown from the property sector is the biggest downward risk for the Chinese economy in the second half of the year,\u201d said Larry Hu, an economist with Macquarie Research.Recent regulatory tightening is likely to start weighing on growth as lending rates are expected to stay high. At the same time, the financial sector is likely to contribute less to growth as the clampdown on off-book investments continues, Mr. Zhou said.Beijing\u2019s steps to put the economy on a more secure footing include raising some short-term interest rates and forcing banks to unwind hidden loans and investments.A spending spree, originally triggered by stimulus after the 2008 global financial crisis, helped drive growth in China in recent years as local governments and companies borrowed money to build roads, airports and apartments. The debt-fueled growth model has left the economy increasingly overleveraged while generating less in the way of direct benefit to the economy.Overall credit has grown at a faster pace than the Chinese economy during this period, alarming policy makers and investors around the world. In May, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded China\u2019s credit rating for the first time in nearly three decades, saying it believes the rapid buildup of debt is eroding the country\u2019s financial strength.\u201cThe rosy picture, especially strong growth in June, will prove to be a blip. China is not going to have a big rebound and the slowdown will reappear in the third quarter,\u201d said Macquarie\u2019s Mr. Hu.\u2014Grace Zhu and Liyan QiAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Economic Data Suggest Continued Resilience.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 02:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-maintains-growth-rate-for-quarter-1500259710", "news_title": "China Maintains 6.9% Economic Growth, Beating Expectations as Beijing Walks Tightrope", "keywords": "china economic growth ,china economy,china government,china growth,china manufacturing ,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,industrial production,economic news,real estate markets"}, {"content": "China\u2019s economy performed unexpectedly well in the first half\u2014growth was steady at 6.9% from a year earlier, while most economists expected a slowdown.That\u2019s prompted surprisingly little celebration.Markets tanked: shares in Shenzhen were down nearly 5% in early trade, as investors worried that better growth also meant a continuing crackdown on debt, which roiled markets this spring, would intensify. President       Xi Jinping       added fuel to the fire with tough comments over the weekend.And the clock is ticking for China to tackle its dangerous debt overhang before slowing growth makes it too difficult. Rebounding trade tensions or U.S. inflation could spell trouble in the months ahead.China\u2019s official GDP figures should always be taken with a grain of salt, but in this case there are good reasons to think growth has held up well. The best evidence comes from the housing sector: steel prices have been on a tear in recent weeks, and housing-investment growth ticked up again to 7.9% in June, the fastest pace since April.Moreover, the uptick is coming from medium-size cities in the interior, rather than the highly speculative coastal markets: housing inventories nationwide peaked at 30 months of sales in early 2015 and have since fallen to around 20 months, estimates Rosealea Yao, senior analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing, a level last seen in early 2011.The other reason to give some credence to the uptick is trade: Chinese export growth hit a four-month high in June and its trade surplus rebounded sharply. June data also showed growth in the IT and metal manufacturing sectors\u2014good indicators for exports and housing respectively\u2014rising sharply.As speculators know well, however, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Much of the new housing strength has been driven by rising mortgage debt\u2014consumer loans outstanding in China were nearly a third higher in May than a year earlier.Two other big problems could take China off the glide path in late 2017. The first is       Donald Trump      : a so-called 100-day action plan on trade is about to expire with few tangible results and rising Chinese trade with North Korea will be difficult for Mr. Trump to ignore. Trade restrictions could knock one leg out from Chinese growth later this year.The second is the Federal Reserve. Chinese regulators will find it far easier to deal with their domestic leverage problem\u2014without sparking a real financial crisis\u2014if capital outflows remain weak, as they have been in recent months. If U.S. inflation surprises on the upside and the Fed moves more aggressively to tighten, however, money will begin to leak out of China again.Good growth last quarter gives Chinese regulators more time to right the ship\u2014investors should welcome the reprieve but realize the waters ahead still look choppy.Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-17 02:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-growth-is-still-on-borrowed-time-1500271959", "news_title": "China\u2019s Growth Is Still on Borrowed Time", "keywords": "china analysis ,china economy,china gdp ,china growth heard on the street ,economic performance,indicators,economic news,commodity,financial market news,analyses,heard on the street,dj exclusive analysis - all"}, {"content": "CARACAS\u2014Millions of Venezuelans at home and abroad voted in an unauthorized referendum staged by government opponents to defy President       Nicol\u00e1s Maduro       and his plans to rewrite the country\u2019s constitution.Of the nearly 6.5 million who voted inside of Venezuela on Sunday, 98% rejected the government\u2019s proposal. Nearly 7.2 million voted in all, but ballots cast abroad had yet to be counted by early Monday.Organizers said the torrent of voters, accounting for a third of those eligible, served as a mass repudiation of Mr. Maduro\u2019s planned national election on July 30 to pick a 545-member special assembly that would have the power to draw up a new constitution. That body is widely expected to remake the political system, giving what critics call an increasingly authoritarian president more power while possibly dissolving the opposition-controlled congress, the National Assembly.\u201cThis result is without precedent in Venezuela,\u201d said opposition lawmaker       Americo de Grazia.       \u201cNow the ball is in our court. In the coming days, we have to propose concrete measures to honor the people\u2019s will.\u201dThe government didn\u2019t have an immediate response to the results, but Mr. Maduro\u2019s government had said it wouldn\u2019t recognize the referendum, saying it isn\u2019t sanctioned by electoral officials. Mr. Maduro had characterized it as an internal consultation by the opposition, while other aides like Caracas Mayor       Jorge Rodriguez       tried to discredit it, alleging fraudulent voting.The poll came in the midst of more than three months of unrest in Venezuela in which nearly 100 people have been killed, the vast majority of them young antigovernment demonstrators. With Venezuelans enraged about a deep economic crisis and the government\u2019s plans for a new constitution, opposition leaders had been hoping that upward of 10 million Venezuelans would vote against the government on Sunday.Violence broke out outside one voting station in the poor west side of Caracas when a pro-government mob opened fire, killing a 61-year-old woman and wounding four others, the Attorney General\u2019s office said. The bloodshed marred a day of largely orderly voting across several time zones and underscored the country\u2019s deep polarization.While Mr. Maduro has said the new assembly to rewrite the constitution would help resolve the country\u2019s deepening political and economic crisis by giving him the powers to take decisive action, the opposition fears it would instead expand his power and bypass elections. Polls show Mr. Maduro and the ruling party would lose an election.\u201cIf the government can\u2019t see that we the poor are tired of living lives that are worsening each day, it\u2019s better they just get out,\u201d 56-year-old phone-company worker       Luis Oliveros       said at a voting center in the western Venezuelan city of Maracaibo.The symbolic referendum was open to Venezuelans inside and outside the country, taking in a large community of exiles who have in recent years fled the violence and economic chaos of their homeland for the U.S., Spain, Colombia and other countries.\u201cThis is a proud moment for those of us who had to flee the country,\u201d said       Edward Triana,        a 31-year-old engineer who worked on an oil refinery in Venezuela until arriving in Colombia three months ago. \u201cWe want this disaster to end as quickly as possible,\u201d he said after he cast his vote in a tent in front of Colombia\u2019s congress.The coordinators of the referendum said Venezuelans voted in hundreds of cities across dozens of countries, with churches, stores, parking lots and schools used as voting centers. Eighty thousand volunteers worked to stage the vote, they said.\u201cThe message that we\u2019re sending is that we\u2019re the majority,\u201d said       Beatriz Olavarria,        who has lived in Miami for 17 years and was among the organizers in that city. \u201cThe people are doing this as a form of protest.\u201dIn Spain,       William Cardenas,        a former Venezuelan diplomat, said Venezuelans were voting in two large plazas in Madrid, as well as several other cities across the country. \u201cThe people see this as civil disobedience,\u201d he said.With polls showing that four of five Venezuelans oppose rewriting the constitution, Sunday\u2019s outcome wasn\u2019t in dispute. The question now is what tangible impact it would have.Casting paper ballots in boxes, voters were asked to reject the so-called constituent assembly Mr. Maduro would use to rewrite the constitution. They also responded to two more questions: whether they wanted presidential elections now and to call on the armed forces, which are seen as oppressive by many Venezuelans, to adhere to the current constitution. The results, though incomplete, showed only a few thousand voted against the opposition\u2019s proposals.\u201cWhile Maduro\u2019s government uses violence, the opposition uses democracy,\u201d said former Colombian President       Andres Pastrana,        one of five ex-heads of state from around the region who traveled to Caracas to show support for the opposition initiative.As sky-high inflation and chronic food shortages weigh on society, protests have flared in working class neighborhoods that were once strongholds of the ruling Socialist Party, like La Pastora in Caracas. \u201cWe want liberty!\u201d shouted more than 100 opposition supporters who lined up there Sunday, near the Miraflores presidential palace.Just blocks away, another large crowd of red-clad government supporters sang and danced around a mock voting station, preparing for Mr. Maduro\u2019s vote this month.\u201cThis is the people sending a message: we want peace, no more violent protests,\u201d said 63-year-old homemaker and pro-government activist       Josefina Borges.\u2014       Mayela Armas       and       Sheyla Urdaneta       contributed to this article.Write to Anatoly Kurmanaev at Anatoly.kurmanaev@wsj.com, Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.com and Juan Forero at Juan.Forero@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Symbolic Plebiscite Repudiates President.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 00:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelans-hold-symbolic-vote-against-bid-to-rewrite-constitution-1500224725", "news_title": "Venezuelans Hold Symbolic Vote Against Bid to Rewrite Constitution ", "keywords": "nicolas maduro,venezuela,venezuela constitution,Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "3-D printing specialist Desktop Metal Inc., whose first product hasn\u2019t shipped yet, has been vaulted into the ranks of billion-dollar startups following a new financing.The Burlington, Mass.-based company raised $115 million in the Series D round at a valuation slightly more than $1 billion, according to a person familiar with the situation.Future Fund, Australia\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund, led the deal, with existing investors participating, according to the person.

But their extraordinary reliability, security and ability to move data in and out means they continue to crunch numbers in the back offices of many large organizations.IBM has continued to update its mainframes over nearly seven decades through successive waves of computer design, and now holds more than 90% of the market, according to analyst       Peter Rutten       at International Data Corp. Global sales of these powerful machines last year totaled $3.5 billion, according to market-research firm             Gartner Inc.Mainframe revenue last year accounted for a small slice of IBM\u2019s total, but those sales combined with related support, software, storage and financing brought in 24% of revenue and 41% of operating profit, analyst       Toni Sacconaghi       of Bernstein Research wrote in a recent report. Mainframe sales are especially valuable to IBM as they support long-term customer relationships that drive further sales, especially software subscriptions that bring in stable recurring revenue, he said.IBM has mentioned the new mainframes as a factor in its 2017 results that will accelerate profit in the second half of the year as investment falls and sales kick in. The company\u2019s financial forecast anticipates that IBM will generate 63% of its total, annual adjusted earnings per share in the third and fourth quarters. That would make the rest of this year one of IBM\u2019s two highest-earning second halves in the past 20 years, according to Mr. Sacconaghi\u2014an ambitious goal in his view.IBM is expected on Tuesday to release its second-quarter results.Users of conventional systems tend to perform encryption on limited portions of data at specific points in their use, leaving opportunities to copy unprotected data and consuming general computing capacity in the process.By offering the option to protect data systemwide, IBM Z would help thwart such threats, according to       Patrick Moorhead       of Moor Insights & Strategy, a market-research firm. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely focusing on the right thing,\u201d he said.IBM isn\u2019t the only maker of business hardware emphasizing data protection.             Intel Corp.       this past Tuesday launched its Xeon Scalable server chips, which accelerate encryption of data as it is being transferred to storage.             Advanced Micro Devices Inc.       in June started selling its Epyc server-chip line, which encrypts data in memory. Equipment vendors such as             Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.       are beefing up security in other ways.ADP                   LLC has been using IBM mainframes since 1957 to run its payroll-processing and human-resources businesses.       Stuart Sackman,        vice president of global products and technology at ADP, looks forward to using IBM Z\u2019s new data-protection features to lock down personal information it maintains on some 30 million people.\u201cOur global security office\u2014and our board\u2014would be happy if we encrypted 100% of everything 100% of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cHistorically that has been hard to do.\u201dWrite to Ted Greenwald at Ted.Greenwald@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'IBM Mainframes Focus on Encryption.'", "news_time": "2017-07-17 00:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibms-latest-line-of-mainframe-computers-focuses-on-encryption-1500264061", "news_title": "IBM\u2019s Latest Line of Mainframe Computers Focuses on Encryption", "keywords": "International Business Machines,IBM,Advanced Micro Devices,AMD,Automatic Data Processing,ADP,Gartner,IT,Hewlett Packard Enterprise,HPE,International Data,Intel,INTC,Peter Rutten,Stuart Sackman,Patrick Moorhead,Toni Sacconaghi,financial performance,earnings,new products,services,marketing,markets,branding,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,computer services,business,consumer services,computing,computer hardware,technology"}]
