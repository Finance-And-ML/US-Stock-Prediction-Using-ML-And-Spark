[{"content": "When       Basil Besh,        an orthopedic hand surgeon based in Fremont, Calif., decided in 2009 to start his own surgery center, he knew he had to have a strong presence on the web to be competitive.He set up a Google alert to tell him whenever his name was mentioned and signed up for a service run by Empathiq, a health-care-focused online reputation-management service, that monitors his online reviews on rating sites such as those run by Healthgrades Operating Co. and             Yelp Inc.       He routinely reads his reviews and calls patients who express dissatisfaction to find out what if anything he can change. This has led him to make improvements to his practice, says Dr. Besh, and to a 4.5-star rating (out of 5) on Yelp.It is standard practice for large and small businesses to closely monitor their online reputations, and now more services are helping doctors, clinics and hospitals do the same. In addition to monitoring reviews and ensuring accuracy about the details of the practice, some of these firms will solicit patient reviews and generate other positive content to push down negative press in web-search results. Some also help their clients contact patients to address their concerns and ask them to change their reviews.Bad online ratings can wreak havoc on doctors\u2019 businesses, in extreme cases driving physicians to leave a particular state to practice elsewhere, according to doctors and reputation-management companies. Ratings sites will take down reviews that use profanity or can be proven fake, but they typically won\u2019t edit or remove a review simply because a doctor (or any business) disputes what is in it.And unlike restaurants or plumbers, doctors can\u2019t change their company name if their reputations are damaged.But doctors and reputation-management firms say paying close attention to reviews and other feedback doesn\u2019t just benefit doctors; consumers also benefit if doctors make changes that result in a better patient experience.More than 70% of consumers search for health information online, according to Pew Research Center, and 77% of consumers say they use online reviews as the first step in finding a new physician, according to a 2015 survey of 1,438 patients by Software Advice, a software research and advisory firm.Andrea Pearson,        chief marketing officer at Healthgrades, one of the largest rating sites for doctors, with one million visitors a day, says reputation-management firms can play a beneficial role by increasing the volume of feedback from patients\u2014but only if the reviews are truthful and come from real patients. (Healthgrades has several checkpoints in place to help it verify the authenticity of reviewers, she says.) Still, she says most physicians will find these firms\u2019 offerings are limited, and will have more success when they work directly with the online sources themselves.Others are more critical of any practice that attempts to skew consumers\u2019 impression about a business.\u201cReputation-management firms are paid to make their clients\u2019 online image as flattering as possible,\u201d says       Luther Lowe,        who heads public policy at Yelp. Doctors, like other business owners, are able to respond to reviews, including negative ones, he says, adding that Yelp sees more failed attempts to mislead consumers with fraudulent positive reviews than it sees failed attempts to malign competitors with fake negative reviews. Yelp, he says, has several technologies in place to detect and pull down fake reviews.Reputation-management firms say patient-confidentiality rules mean physicians have to be more careful than other businesses in how they respond to negative reviews and complaints online. For example, if a patient says a doctor missed a particular diagnosis, physicians can\u2019t publicly dispute the patient\u2019s claim because it would violate confidentiality. Instead, doctors are encouraged to respond generically to the review online and ask the patient to contact the practice for a more specific response.Banner Health, a large integrated health service employing or affiliated with 9,000 doctors, monitors its online reviews through Reputation.com of Redwood City, Calif. Soon, Banner will start using natural-language recognition technology to analyze online comments on             Facebook                   and other social-media sites and reroute negative feedback into its call center, a service provided by             Salesforce.com.       The software will divide comments into positive, neutral and negative buckets, and the negative comments will be monitored continuously during business hours. Complaints that require action will be issued a trouble ticket, just as if a patient had called the call center directly. For instance, if a patient is in the emergency room and complains about a long wait, Banner may send a staff member to apologize and give them a coffee, says       Alexandra Morehouse,        chief marketing officer of Banner.The health system also solicits phone- and email-based patient-satisfaction scores directly and will have doctors call patients to discuss negative reviews. \u201cOne woman hung up three times because she didn\u2019t believe the doctor would call\u201d about a review, says Ms. Morehouse. The doctor eventually connected with her and was able to clear up a miscommunication, she says.IHealthSpot, another reputation-management service used by health-care professionals, builds separate websites called microsites that are embedded in its clients\u2019 pages. These microsites pull in reviews from ratings sites and the web but display only those that are three, four or five stars\u2014effectively hiding the most negative reviews. The microsites also provide an overall rating based on that subset of reviews.\u201cFrom our perspective, there are often reviews on sites that are unfair, [yet] you can\u2019t get them removed,\u201d says       Mary Hall,        iHealthSpot\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting rid of the bad ones, just highlighting the best ones. It is a bit of a gray area.\u201dCarolyn Murray,        who owns a medical weight-loss clinic called Physicians Weight Loss Centers in Columbia, Md., says she turned to iHealthSpot a few years ago when a prospective patient wanted to cancel her appointment after seeing a negative review about the clinic on Yelp.The review was left by an unhappy patient who had missed several appointments without canceling and wanted her visit fee back even though the cancellation policy stated she would forfeit it, says Ms. Murray, who isn\u2019t a physician herself but employs one in the business.Another negative Yelp review described a patient experience that clearly didn\u2019t happen at her clinic, she says. Ms. Murray says she appealed to Yelp, which declined to take down the reviews, saying she could respond to them if she wanted. Yelp declined to comment.Ms. Murray says that employing a reputation-management firm has been helpful because she now knows when patients leave reviews, good or bad, and can respond to them quickly. But she is frustrated that people can say whatever they want about her clinic even if it isn\u2019t truthful. She says that several patients have threatened to leave bad reviews if they don\u2019t get their money back.The clinic has an average 2-star rating out of 5 on Yelp, based on eight reviews, and a 3.7-star rating out of 5 on Google, based on 15 reviews. The microsite on her clinic\u2019s website, however, lists a 5-star average patient rating, with most of the reviews coming from Google.Ms. Murray says she believes the microsite reviews \u201care helpful, not misleading, because a lot of the negative reviews are incorrect.\u201dMost doctor reviews are positive, according to industry research. About 75% of the time, negative reviews of doctors and clinics are about things like wait times, grumpy receptionists or parking\u2014things can easily be addressed, those in the industry say. The other complaints tend to center on the physician\u2019s bedside manner, confusion about treatment or follow-up care, or lack of follow-up. Only occasionally do reviews state that a doctor treated them incorrectly, they say.Dr. Besh, the California hand surgeon, learned from reading a review that patients were waiting a long time to see him. He reduced wait times in part by emailing forms in advance through a patient portal.At the same time, \u201cthere\u2019s a price to be paid for that\u2014what patients want versus what patients need,\u201d he says. For instance, a patient once wrote a negative review because Dr. Besh refused to order an MRI. \u201cWe work by guidelines, and the MRI wasn\u2019t warranted,\u201d he says. But \u201cI can see how a doctor could say we\u2019re going to order MRIs on everyone\u201d so they won\u2019t get bad reviews.\u201cOnline reputation review is really a double-edged sword,\u201d says Dr. Besh.Ms. Wang is a writer in London.

Do people who exercise tend to have better social lives or achieve more of their goals?The answer appears to be yes, according to a study that has been accepted for publication in the journal Personality and Individual Differences. Exercise not only makes us feel more positive, the study found, but it also increases the likelihood that we\u2019ll do more positive things.That supports the use of exercise to help treat people with depression, anxiety and other illnesses. It also suggests exercise could help healthy people improve their everyday lives.The team of researchers at George Mason University recruited 179 college students from northern Virginia and asked them to record their exercise every day for 21 days. The students were asked each day if they had participated in any of eight activities including cycling, weight training or swimming, along with an \u201cother\u201d activity in case theirs wasn\u2019t listed.They were also asked if they\u2019d had positive social interactions each day with friends, dates, family members or other people, or if they\u2019d achieved something they wanted to get done, such as completing a project.The students rated the importance to them of both types of activities on a scale of 1 to 4.The results: On a given day, students who exercised also tended to participate in more social and achievement activities than on days when they didn\u2019t exercise, the study found, and they engaged in activities that tended to matter to them more.In addition, exercise on one day predicted positive social activity on the next day, but not achievement activity.The researchers also found that positive social and achievement activities on one day didn\u2019t predict exercise on the next day.The results support an approach to treating depression called behavioral activation.\u201cWhen we become depressed or whatever it is we\u2019re going through, we say to ourselves that we\u2019ll get out when we feel better,\u201d says       Kevin Young,        the study\u2019s lead author, who is completing his doctorate in clinical psychology at George Mason University. \u201cUnfortunately, what we also see is that we do not feel better until we get out.\u201dMr. Young, who will be a clinical psychologist, adds, \u201cWe try and help someone start sprinkling activities again into their lives. That will result in improvement in mood, and [positive] emotion will follow.\u201dMr. Young is now thinking about ways the study could be expanded. Does exercising with a group have a different impact on other activities than exercising alone? Can exercise affect future negative as well as positive activities? How much time do we have to spend exercising before positive activities follow?And what is the mechanism that makes exercise work this way? Is it the improved mood after we exercise that leads us to have better relationships and get more done, or is it an improved sense of self-esteem?Although he emphasizes that the study was done on healthy people who weren\u2019t screened for depression, Mr. Young says he\u2019s now more inclined to have his patients use exercise to help them re-engage with activities they enjoy. Depression, he says, saps people\u2019s energy and makes them fatigued.\u201cIt\u2019s torture,\u201d he says. \u201cExercise is one method of intervention we have.\u201dMs. Gage is a writer in San Jose, Calif.

FB 0.79%       to Hollywood: Let\u2019s do lunch.The social-networking giant is talking to Hollywood studios and agencies about producing TV-quality shows with an eye toward launching original programming by late summer, people familiar with the matter said.In meetings with major talent agencies including Creative Artists Agency, United Talent Agency, William Morris Endeavor and ICM Partners, Facebook has indicated it is willing to commit to production budgets as high as $3 million per episode, people familiar with the situation say.That\u2019s the price range of high-end cable-TV shows. Facebook is also interested in more moderate-cost scripted shows in the mid-to-high six-figure-per-episode range, these people say. The company will be aggressive about trying to own as much of that content as possible.The push for TV shows is part of a two-track effort at Facebook to up its game in video and target the tens of billions of ad dollars spent on television.Facebook also is seeking short-form content, primarily unscripted, that could run for 10 minutes in the Spotlight section for videos, the people familiar with the matter say.The social network is guaranteeing creators of short-form fare a minimum $5,000 to $20,000 share of ad revenue per episode, a person familiar with the company\u2019s strategy said. Companies working on such content for Facebook include BuzzFeed, ATTN and Refinery 29, according to people familiar with the situation.Facebook declined to comment on specifics of its content plans. In a statement, Vice President of Media Partnerships Nick Grudin said, \u201cWe\u2019re supporting a small group of partners and creators as they experiment with the kinds of shows you can build a community around\u2014from sports to comedy to reality to gaming. We\u2019re focused on episodic shows and helping all our partners understand what works across different verticals and topics.\u201dFacebook has told people in the industry that late summer is a bit of a moving target for launch. It hopes to target audiences from ages 13 to 34, with a particular focus on the 17-to-30 range. It appears to be seeking shows along the lines of the drama \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d on Freeform, the cable channel formerly known as ABC Family, or similar to ABC\u2019s \u201cScandal\u201d and reality hit \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d people familiar with the matter say.Among the shows Facebook already has lined up is \u201cStrangers,\u201d a relationship drama aimed at millennials that made its debut at the Sundance Film Festival, and the game show \u201cLast State Standing.\u201dFacebook is willing to take another network\u2019s castoffs or \u201cdistressed assets,\u201d as one entertainment executive put it. The company is nearing a deal for the family comedy \u201cLoosely Exactly Nicole,\u201d which Viacom\u2019s MTV canceled earlier this year after one season. An executive familiar with the show said its budget was in the $1 million-per-episode range.\u201cLoosely Exactly Nicole\u201d is near and dear to       Mina Lefevre,        who developed it while at MTV and now heads Facebook\u2019s development effort, reporting to Ricky Van Veen, founder of the website CollegeHumor, who joined Facebook last year.Facebook has told people it wants to steer clear of shows about children and young teens as well as political dramas, news and shows with nudity and rough language.Facebook enters a bustling TV scene where old and new players are creating a staggering amount of original programming, making it hard for even good shows to break through. Last year there were more than 455 scripted shows on TV.Compared with digital players such as             Netflix Inc.,Amazon.com Inc.       and Hulu, which have been in TV for years now and have well-stocked pipelines of original programming, Facebook is late to the game.             Apple Inc.       is also hunting for original TV programming and just hired two top executives from             Sony Corp.\u2019s       TV studio.The longer-form scripted shows on Facebook are expected to run no more than 30 minutes and will carry ads. A potential challenge for Facebook is Hollywood\u2019s desire to own much of its content. Typically, studios and producers effectively rent their shows to networks through licensing deals, and are reluctant to part with rights to shows in perpetuity.The entertainment industry is eager to see if Facebook can translate the data it has on tastes and habits of nearly two billion monthly users into insights that make for more popular television.Facebook is expected to spread out the release of its episodes, in the traditional fashion, rather than dropping an entire season at one time, as Netflix and Amazon do, the people familiar with the matter say. Facebook sees its platform as an in-house water cooler of sorts, ideal for building a social community around shows.In another move that will distinguish it from Netflix and Amazon, Facebook is also telling Hollywood it will share viewership data with them.\u201cFacebook is saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to be completely transparent,\u2019 \u201d one agent said. \u201c \u2018You\u2019ll share in our ad dollars, our profits will be your profits, you will get all the data.\u2019 It\u2019s a humongously different mind-set.\u201d\u2014       Jack Marshall        contributed to this article.Write to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com and Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Facebook Makes Pitch to Hollywood Studios.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 23:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-is-going-hollywood-seeking-scripted-tv-programming-1498388401", "news_title": "Facebook Is Going Hollywood, Seeking Scripted TV Programming", "keywords": "facebook spotlight,facebook tv,facebook video,loosely exactly nicole,Creative Artists Agency,William Morris Endeavor,ICM Partners,Facebook,FB,United Talent Agency,Mina Lefevre,Ricky Van Veen,political,general news,arts,entertainment,television,radio,agents,managers for public figures,business,consumer services,internet,online,media,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "BOGOT\u00c1, Colombia\u2014A multistory tourist boat packed with about 160 passengers sank Sunday in a lake near Medell\u00edn, leaving six people dead and 31 others missing.A major rescue effort involving Colombia\u2019s air force and firefighters from nearby cities was looking for survivors at the Guatap\u00e9 reservoir where the accident took place.Dramatic videos circulating on social media show the turquoise and yellow-trimmed party boat, called El Almirante, rocking back and forth as people crawled down from a fourth-floor roof as it began sinking. A flotilla of recreational boats and personal watercraft rushed to the scene to pull people from the vessel and deliver them to the shore, avoiding an even deadlier tragedy.Margarita Moncada, the head of the disaster response agency in Antioquia state, said that according to a preliminary report, 99 people were rescued and 40 others managed to find a way to shore on their own and were in good condition. Speaking to reporters from the reservoir, she said nine people had been killed and about 28 are still missing.But later Sunday President       Juan Manuel Santos       arrived at Guatap\u00e9 and said 122 people were either rescued or found their way to shore. Six had died and another 31 were missing, he said. The discrepancies in the number of fatalities couldn\u2019t be immediately reconciled.It was unclear what caused the boat to sink. Some people who witnessed the tragedy from the shore said the boat appeared to be overloaded, but Mr. Santos said it was sailing well below capacity. None of the passengers were wearing a life vest. Complicating the search, there wasn\u2019t even a passenger list.Daniel Giraldo, owner of an Italian restaurant in Guatap\u00e9, said he went to the bay after hearing the sound of ambulances. When he got to the shore, people told him the ship had gone under.\u201cIt sank in a matter of four minutes,\u201d he said.Authorities were at a loss to say exactly how many people were on the boat and asked passengers or their loved ones to report to a rescue center hastily set up along the shore.The reservoir surrounding the soaring rocky outcrop of El Pe\u00f1ol is a popular weekend destination a little more than an hour from Medell\u00edn. It was especially busy Sunday as Colombians celebrated a long holiday weekend.\u2014Copyright 2017 the Associated Press", "news_time": "2017-06-25 23:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/three-die-after-tourist-boat-sinks-in-colombia-1498430076", "news_title": "Six Die After Tourist Boat Sinks in Colombia", "keywords": "boat sinks,guatape,recreational boat,tourist boat,Juan Manuel Santos,political,general news,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,transport accidents,transport"}, {"content": "Technology is offering a new fix for one of the most confounding health-care challenges: getting patients with chronic disease to take better care of themselves.About half of all adults suffer from one or more chronic diseases, which account for seven of 10 deaths and 86% of U.S. health-care costs. But preventing and treating such ailments requires time that doctors don\u2019t have in brief office visits, and a degree of daily self-management that many patients have been unable to handle. They often become overwhelmed by the demands of their daily regimens, slip back into poor health habits, fail to take their medications correctly\u2014and end up in the emergency room.While there has been something of a national obsession with health apps like fitness trackers, most are aimed at exercise and lifestyle buffs and aren\u2019t designed to link patients to health-care providers. There is generally no evidence to back their use in improving health outcomes for those who have chronic disease unless the patients\u2019 own doctors are involved.New studies, however, show that the emerging field of digital medicine\u2014a combination of remote monitoring, behavior modification and personalized intervention overseen by the patients\u2019 own doctors\u2014can improve outcomes in some of the most costly and tough-to-manage categories such as diabetes, heart disease and lung disease. As a result, a growing number of hospitals and health systems are adopting digital programs that have been studied in clinical trials and can be delivered on a broad scale at low cost with the use of smartphones, wireless devices and sensors.In addition to raising patients\u2019 confidence that they can manage their health\u2014and providing some hand-holding and nudging when they don\u2019t\u2014experts say the innovations allow doctors to gather data about patient behavior and symptoms, and intervene when patients aren\u2019t following their regimens or have a flare-up in their disease. They also enable care teams to deliver continuing and consistent support to change behavior, such as losing weight, taking medications as prescribed and exercising. \u201cDigital medicine allows us to get into your life in a personal way, deliver interventions continuously and inspire you to be healthy in a way an office-based practice can\u2019t,\u201d says Joseph Kvedar, a physician and researcher who is vice president, connected health, at Partners HealthCare, which includes Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.Partners has tested such approaches as remote blood-pressure monitoring for hypertension patients, text messaging to motivate diabetes patients to exercise daily, and remotely monitored electronic pillboxes that alert congestive-heart-failure patients to take their medications. Such technology, if widely adopted, could deliver behavioral interventions to whole populations and engage patients in ways that were unimaginable in the past, Dr. Kvedar says.The push for digital medicine comes as reimbursement for medical care is shifting from fee-for-service arrangements to a focus on delivering quality outcomes at reasonable cost. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services currently covers some telehealth services, such as seeing a doctor over a video connection, and is now contemplating changes that might cover the use of digital services such as apps as well. The explosion in digital medicine has spurred researchers to develop apps for studies of diabetes, asthma and heart disease, and myriad technology startups are pitching disease-management apps to health-care providers.But Amir Lerman, an interventional cardiologist and professor of Medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., cautions, \u201cYou can\u2019t just build an app in your garage and think it is going to change medical care. You need to have a treatment plan behind it, and a health system to care for the patient.\u201dThat, in turn, has spurred the health-care industry to study which technologies are best. Two dozen health systems including Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and the University of Virginia Health System have joined a network run by Avia, a company that helps vet and test digital approaches to patient care. And the American Medical Association recently announced a collaboration called Xcertia with the American Heart Association, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society and others, which is developing guidelines for evaluating mobile health applications. \u201cPhysicians recognize the tremendous potential in digital health tools,\u201d says       James Madara,        the American Medical Association\u2019s chief executive, \u201cbut without a framework to evaluate them, there could actually be harmful effects.\u201d\u201cWe have to figure out how to prioritize these thousands of ideas that come at us every week,\u201d says Mike Dandorph, president of Rush. \u201cWhen we try innovative ideas, we must ask, does it advance outcomes, provide a good patient experience and change the overall cost of care?\u201dHere are some approaches backed by evidence that are gaining traction in digital medicine.Prediabetes\u2014higher-than-normal blood sugar\u2014increases the risk of stroke and heart attack. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prediabetes affects 86 million adults, or more than one in three, and as many as 30% of them will develop diabetes within five years unless they lose weight through a healthy diet and exercise.While many health plans and insurers offer diabetes-prevention plans, the lifestyle changes to ward off diabetes can require daily hand-holding, so more are looking for ways to deliver such programs digitally. In collaboration with the American Medical Association, Salt Lake City-based Intermountain Healthcare, with 22 hospitals and 185 clinics, is pilot-testing an online program provided by San Francisco-based Omada Health for patients at risk for diabetes. The yearlong program starts with a core 16-week online course on better lifestyle habits, and assigns patients to a personal health coach and private online support forum with moderated discussions.Participants receive a pedometer and a cellular scale that transmits their weight readings to their Omada profile, and are visible to the coach. They log their daily activity and food either online or with a mobile app; if they have a connected device such as an Apple Watch, they can link it with the program to transmit activity automatically. Their results are displayed on a personal dashboard. After the initial sessions, Omada provides a 36-week sustaining curriculum focusing on weight maintenance. \u201cYou can\u2019t just send someone a scale and a step tracker and pray for results,\u201d says Omada Chief Executive       Sean Duffy.       \u201cYou have to combine these instruments with high-touch intervention\u201d that includes social support and personalization.Coaches usually reach out once or twice a week to check on whether participants have completed their lesson, answer questions and congratulate the patient on tracking activity or meals. Patients can also communicate as often as they like with coaches, who are required to respond within a day of any outreach. Omada sends Intermountain aggregate patient reports to show how an overall population is doing, but can also send individual patient reports for follow-up. Coaches can also encourage patients struggling in the program to reach out to their Intermountain doctors.Research has shown that Omada participants are able to maintain weight loss and lower average blood-sugar levels two years after starting. In one study of 501 Humana Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, published in the Journal of Aging and Health, participants lost 7.5% of their initial weight after 12 months, improved blood-sugar levels, and lowered cholesterol. In addition to reducing their risk of diabetes, participants also reported improvements in self-care, diet and exercise, and lower feelings of depression and isolation.\u201cThe new reality is that patients want to seek care in their own environment and on their own schedule online, as opposed to going to the office and waiting for a provider,\u201d says Mark Greenwood, an Intermountain physician and one of the initiative\u2019s program leads. \u201cThe future of primary care is to be both physician and navigator, hooking up patients with technology to help them manage their conditions.\u201dOmada estimates health plans and insurers it contracts with recoup their investment in the program within two years, with a predicted net savings of more than $2,000 per participant over five years. Dr. Greenwood says payment for the program will be based on outcomes. But he also says savings will come from preventing progression to full-blown diabetes, which can cost $8,000 a year to manage per patient.One Intermountain participant, Michael Astle, 64, enrolled after he learned his blood sugar was in the high range. \u201cI knew that my health was at risk, and I wanted to lose weight,\u201d he says, but he kept putting off doing anything about it. He liked using the cellular scale to track his weight and the app on his phone to record activity and diet, and though he never met the other online participants, he says the forum helped \u201cform a bond if someone was struggling or feeling bad and needed encouragement.\u201dWithin 16 weeks he was down to 190 pounds from 227, and continues to lose weight toward his goal of 180. Mr. Astle says it is motivating to know that every time he steps off the scale, it sends his weight to his coach, \u201cand I can\u2019t let it go back up.\u201dChronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, affects an estimated 30 million Americans and encompasses emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Commonly associated with smoking, it causes increasing difficulty with breathing, and exacerbations can lead to repeated trips to the ER and hospitalizations if not treated in a timely manner with medication. Patients may fail to recognize that symptoms are getting into the danger zone, leading to delays in treatment.Temple University\u2019s Temple Lung Center in Philadelphia has developed a health application called COPD Co-Pilot. Once daily, patients use a smartphone to report symptoms including breathlessness, cough, wheeze and sore throat on eight easy-to-read screens, and use hand-held meters to measure the air flowing in and out of their lungs. Those who don\u2019t report in by noon get a reminder from the system.A computer algorithm helps measure how serious the symptoms are compared with the patient\u2019s baseline data; nurses review the scores and refer patients who appear to need immediate treatment to doctors who can prescribe same-day therapy. There are different treatment plans for less urgent scenarios, which nurses can recommend after review with a doctor, and communicate via text or email back to patients who can respond that they will comply or that they may need something else.A 2015 study in the journal Telemedicine and e-Health found that patients who used the app to report daily symptoms and received same-day treatment experienced fewer and less severe exacerbation symptoms, leading to improved symptom control, lung function and activity status.\u201cBy linking the provider directly to the patient, we can get therapy to them sooner rather than later and prevent things from getting worse,\u201d says Gerard Criner, director of the Temple Lung Center and principal investigator on the study. (The technology used in the study has been adapted by a Temple spinoff company, HGE Health Care Solutions, founded by Dr. Criner.)Ronny Neal, 58, a Temple COPD patient, has been using the app for about a year. His condition sometimes makes it difficult to walk or breathe and once landed him in the hospital for several days. Mr. Neal was skeptical at first, when his team at Temple suggested the program, wondering, \u201cAre they going to follow me every step I take?\u201dBut he says it has helped motivate him to stay on top of his symptoms much better than in the past, and get attention and medication quickly when they get worse. On the few occasions he forgets to enter his information, he gets a text nudging him to check in. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough disease with no cure, but you don\u2019t want it to get any worse and you don\u2019t want to be going in and out of the hospital,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s now part of my routine\u2014get up, brush my teeth, take my medicine and check in.\u201dDr. Criner says the program aims to help patients better control their COPD, while staying connected to the Temple Lung Center team on a daily basis.Patients too often fail to take their medications as prescribed, a particularly dangerous problem for chronic-disease patients. One study showed that new prescriptions for diabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension, known as high blood pressure, weren\u2019t even filled 22% of the time. Because high blood pressure and high cholesterol don\u2019t have apparent symptoms, patients may skip doses or figure they don\u2019t really need the drugs.To improve patients\u2019 compliance with blood-pressure medication, Rush University Medical Center is working with Proteus Digital Health, of Redwood City, Calif., to prescribe its Proteus Discover system, which encapsulates medications in a single pill with an ingestible sensor the size of a grain of sand, made of trace amounts of minerals. Once swallowed by a patient, the sensor communicates with a wearable patch worn on the torso, which records the time the medication was taken as well as data such as heart rate, steps and rest.The patch transmits the information wirelessly to an app on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or iPad, for the patient to monitor and share with a health-care provider, and sends an alert if a dose is missed. If the patient forgets to take a pill, they can be alerted by a notification to their mobile device.A study published last year in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that the use of Proteus Discover led to greater reductions in blood pressure and cholesterol in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes than usual care.\u201cWe know there is a mismatch between the prescriptions we write and the prescriptions that get taken by patients,\u201d says Anthony Perry, vice president for population health and ambulatory services at Rush. \u201cThis is a tool that provides data back to the patients and provides a feedback loop to help build strong habits that support taking medications consistently.\u201dHeart disease causes one-third of deaths in the U.S., but many of them are due to preventable risk factors like poor diet, smoking and lack of exercise. After angioplasty, a procedure to reopen coronary arteries following a heart attack, patients can avoid a repeat event by undergoing a cardiac rehabilitation program. But patients may not do all the follow-up necessary, and programs are often limited in the personal attention and time patients get from rehab teams.In a study at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn., published earlier this year in the journal Clinical Investigations, researchers tested a health program available online or through a smartphone app that provided information about healthy lifestyles and asked patients undergoing cardiac rehab to report dietary and exercise habits. Compared with a group of patients that had usual care, those using the digital program lost more weight and improved lifestyle habits and had fewer cardio-related ER visits and rehospitalizations.Steve Ommen, a cardiologist at Mayo and medical director of its Center for Connected Care, says Mayo is incorporating apps, wearable monitoring devices and other digital technology into programs for patients with chronic diseases.Mayo\u2019s aim, Dr. Ommen says, is not to find an app for each disease, but to find solutions that can be broadly used in managing all complex diseases, particularly since so many patients are struggling with multiple conditions. Ideally, he says, patients could have a period of intense monitoring to get them on the right track and then \u201cgraduate to self-care and self-monitoring.\u201d\u201cWhenever we introduce a new technology to help them, patients are very open to trying it,\u201d he says. \u201cThis will definitely change the relationship between patients and care teams, but we see it as being more connected and really extending and enhancing our relationship.\u201dMs. Landro, a former Wall Street Journal assistant managing editor, is the author of \u201cSurvivor: Taking Control of Your Fight Against Cancer.\u201d She can be reached at reports@wsj.com.Appeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'How Apps Can Help Manage Chronic Diseases.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 22:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-apps-can-help-manage-chronic-diseases-1498443120", "news_title": "How Apps Can Help Manage Chronic \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tDiseases", "keywords": " apps for chronic conditions, apps for chronic disease,chronic disease, disease management, health apps,health care,health-care technology,journal reports, patient behavior, patient compliance,heart,cardiac disease,political,general news,diabetes,health,hypertension,high blood pressure,medical conditions,life sciences,hospital care,healthcare provision"}, {"content": "Hospitals are rethinking the way they care for premature babies.The traditional neonatal intensive-care unit puts preterm babies\u2014those born before 37 weeks\u2014into incubators in a room with six to eight other infants. But hospitals are starting to realize that premature infants benefit from close physical contact with their parents.One of the latest NICUs, in Beacon Children\u2019s Hospital of South Bend, Ind., was designed around this idea. There, families can stay together for weeks or months in private rooms that facilitate skin-to-skin contact\u2014also known as kangaroo care\u2014between parent and baby.Kangaroo care, which is common in Sweden and Canada, has been shown to reduce mortality, infection rates and lengths of hospital stays in preterm babies, while improving infant growth and breast-feeding rates.Instead of nurses and other hospital personnel taking charge of the babies, the hospital staff becomes coaches who teach parents how to care for their infants themselves. All care is provided in private rooms with families present. Even medical procedures are done in the same private rooms.Beacon\u2019s unit, which opened in May, is the first in the U.S. planned so that mothers who have just delivered are able to stay with their babies, no matter how critical the baby\u2019s condition, in a room designed specifically for that purpose, says Robert D, White, a neonatologist who is the creator, along with Sue Ann Barton, principal architect at ZGF architects, of Beacon\u2019s new facility. The exception, he notes, is for mothers who are so ill after delivery that they need to go to an adult ICU.\u201cSkin-to-skin care is a biological imperative for the sensory development of preterm babies,\u201d Dr. White says. \u201cIt reduces stress levels and helps preterm infants adapt to life outside the womb, improves breast-feeding and leads to healthy weight gain.\u201dBeacon\u2019s facility has so-called NIC2 rooms for mothers who are still patients after delivery and their babies. When the mother is discharged, she and her baby would move to a room set up for mother as parent rather than patient, but otherwise similar to the NIC2 rooms.Both types of rooms have linen pickup just outside of the room to prevent interruptions, private bathrooms with showers, breast pumps, lockable drawers, refrigerators for breast milk, and lighting that can be changed to suit the mood and be kept from shining in a baby\u2019s eyes. Most also have sleeping space for two on a pullout sofa bed.William Edwards, a professor of pediatrics at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth and medical director of the Special Care Nursery at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, N.H., says Beacon is a leader in initiatives that promote constructive emotional and physical development in preterm infants, rather than the traditional focus on avoiding complications. \u201cIn the U.S., we are at the beginning of a trend in innovative care for preterm infants that focuses on a shift to models that are already standard in other countries, with the goal of maximizing brain development for babies who have left the womb early,\u201d he says.What follows is a closer look at the features in Beacon\u2019s NIC2 rooms.1. \u201cKangaroo\u201d chair: Allows a parent to lean back and safely hold the baby skin-to-skin for extended periods.Purpose: Under the kangaroo care method, mothers hold their nearly naked newborns in an upright position against their chest. Skin-to-skin bonding with the mother reduces babies\u2019 stress levels and helps infants adapt to life outside the womb. It also improves breast-feeding and weight gain, and lowers infection rates, and it is important to the sensory development of a preterm baby. When practiced for six hours a week for eight weeks, it has been shown to accelerate brain maturation in EEG trackings of infant brain activity.2. Sound control: The room and NICU unit are designed to be very quiet. Acoustical ceiling tile, heavily insulated walls, carpeted corridors and other features are designed to keep sounds under 40 decibels\u2014about the level of a babbling brook. The alarm controls at the bedside are silent, with signals going to the nurse\u2019s communication device, and the HVAC system is designed to make as little noise as possible.Purpose: Reducing unwanted noise and increasing appropriate sounds for a newborn baby, such as a mother\u2019s speech and lullabies, promotes the baby\u2019s development.3. Dimmable light sources:  Rather than the standard big light in the center of a room, there are dimmable controls, and no lights are located over a baby\u2019s bed to avoid having light shine directly into an infant\u2019s eyes. One wall of each room is lighted by a bank of LED lights that can be controlled by the family to wash that wall with a color of their choice. The color on the left wall is a parent-selected color. A stronger light for medical procedures is mounted on an adjustable arm.Purpose: Enables parents and staff to dim the lights and control the ambience, making the room feel less institutional. None of the lights are in the direct view of the baby because preemies have very thin eyelids and cannot turn over or otherwise turn away from an unpleasant light source.4. Window to the outside: The layout of the NICU unit puts as many rooms as possible on external walls, and there is a large central atrium so that all the rooms receive abundant natural light. Here the view is into a glass-covered atrium, which has a treehouse and plants in it.Purpose: Exposure to natural light helps maintain circadian rhythms for babies, parents and staff, and views of nature reduce stress and anxiety.5. Pullout sofa:  Most NICU rooms have a sleeper sofa with space for two family members.Purpose: To encourage family to be there as much as possible so that the baby will receive lots of human contact. The d\u00e9cor is designed to be homey, with color and natural finishes, and families are encouraged to add personal touches. There is also a full bathroom with a shower.6. Breast-milk refrigerator: Every room has a breast pump and a separate refrigerator for breast milk. The refrigerator is built in below the counter on the left sidePurpose: To facilitate breast-feeding.7. Room size: All NIC2 rooms are more than 260 square feet.Purpose: The large size allows for care of critically ill babies who may require more equipment for life support and a large care team for specialized care. If an infant needs surgery and is too fragile to move, the NIC2\u2019s larger size allows space to perform a procedure.8. Articulating arms: These arms on the head wall can hold a procedure light (shown), IV pumps and other medical equipment,Purpose: The head wall behind a hospital bed contains outlets for oxygen, air suction and electricity, and mounts for other support equipment. In ordinary ICUs, there is limited flexibility for movement of the babies. Here, articulating arms allow these devices to be repositioned easily when the baby is transferred from the incubator to a parent\u2019s arms.Ms. Sadick is a writer in New York.

Now, they may have found it in an unlikely place: Crispr.Crispr, which stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is part of the immune system of bacteria. It works by capturing an invader\u2019s DNA and integrating it into the genome of the bacteria to help fend off future attacks. For bacteria, Crispr serves as a kind of immunization card.While scientists have studied the Crispr system for years, they only more recently started unlocking its broader potential as a technology. The breakthrough came after a group of scientists led by       Jennifer Doudna       of the University of California, Berkeley, and       Emmanuelle Charpentier,        then of the University of Vienna, published a paper in 2012 demonstrating how to reprogram one particular Crispr system, Crispr-Cas9, to enable the editing of genes.Shortly after, in 2013, several groups reported using Crispr to edit genes in mammalian cells. Crispr diagnostics, an area of interest to some researchers early on, largely got pushed aside in the frenzy that followed.Then, following an outbreak of the Zika virus in Brazil in 2015, a team of researchers led by       James Collins       of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University started developing a new Zika test. They wanted something that could be deployed to remote locations and offer rapid detection. When discussions turned to how to also enable distinguishing between the African and American strains, one of the researchers proposed Crispr. Last year, the Collins lab published a paper on its Crispr Zika diagnostic.Since then, interest in advancing Crispr\u2019s usefulness in diagnostics has grown. The goal is to develop tests that can be used in the field, and eventually at home, without requiring analysis by specialized technicians or access to labs, as current blood tests do.\u201cWhat Crispr allows is the democratization of measurement,\u201d says Dan Wattendorf, director of Innovative Technology Solutions at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has provided funds for Crispr-based diagnostic development.Crispr-Cas9, the best known of the Crispr systems, can be programmed to insert, edit, or delete a gene in an organism\u2019s genome and has caused enormous excitement among scientists. In the lab, Crispr has helped correct mutations in human cells that cause diseases like sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis. Crispr systems operate using different proteins or enzymes, known as Crispr-associated proteins, or Cas.The possibility of someday curing disease or making changes in the genome of embryos has spurred huge investment\u2014but also a contentious patent battle for control of the technology, and an ethical debate about how, and when, Crispr\u2019s gene-editing capacity should be used.Meanwhile, as new Crispr proteins have been discovered and their properties analyzed, scientists working in a number of research labs now realize that Crispr\u2019s unique aspects offer a new approach in diagnostics.Guillaume Lambert,        who runs a lab at Cornell University, says his group wants to use Crispr to detect antibiotic-resistance genes, so that patients don\u2019t lose time, and continue infecting others, while taking a drug to which their particular strain of bacteria won\u2019t respond. \u201cThis is a potentially dangerous treatment delay,\u201d says Dr. Lambert, a former member of the Collins lab who helped develop the Zika test while there.Keith Pardee,        an assistant professor at the University of Toronto and a collaborator on the Zika Crispr diagnostic, says he is principal investigator on a project being funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the International Development Research Centre to launch what is believed to be the first clinical trial of a Crispr diagnostic. The trial is expected to start in 2018.The trial, which will include the Collins lab, five labs in Latin America, and others, will test the diagnostic on patient samples in Ecuador, Brazil and Colombia. The scientists involved are discussing detection not only of Zika but also related viruses such as dengue, Chikungunya virus and yellow fever, Dr. Pardee says.Discovery of Crispr proteins besides Cas9 has also helped spur research in Crispr diagnostics. In 2016, Dr. Doudna\u2019s lab published a paper demonstrating how Cas13a may be useful to detect sequences of RNA in a virus. (RNA carries genetic information from DNA and catalyzes protein synthesis in the cell.)Unlike the better known Cas9, which makes a specific cut in a DNA sequence then stops at its target, a key feature of the Cas13a enzyme is that it keeps on cutting. The continued chewing of RNA along with the original target\u2014the Berkeley researchers call the enzyme a kind of molecular Pac-Man\u2014allows for the possibility of detecting a virus even when smaller amounts of RNA molecules are present.Dr. Collins says he was working on improving his group\u2019s Zika diagnostic when a colleague,       Feng Zhang       of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, reached out after reading his paper. Dr. Zhang, a pioneer of Crispr-Cas9 gene editing, was also working on developing a Crispr diagnostic. But he wanted to use Crispr-Cas13a, not Cas9, and suggested to Dr. Collins that they combine their efforts.Earlier this year, their labs announced the creation of a new diagnostic platform with the ability to identify different viruses based on extremely low amounts of RNA in blood and urine samples. It works in a regular test tube or on special paper activated using body heat. The scientists looked for a catchy name for the platform, and chose Sherlock, for Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter unlocking.Sherlock, Dr. Zhang says, allows detection of a virus down to a single molecule of RNA, an important factor in a disease like Zika, which can make someone very sick even when only a small amount of virus is present. The new test, adds Dr. Collins, \u201cis 1,000 times more sensitive than what we did with Zika.\u201dNew discoveries that could lead to even more Crispr diagnostics keep coming. Last month, Dr. Doudna and her Berkeley group published a paper that describes 10 new Crispr enzymes, all variations of the Cas13a protein. The discovery, the scientists report, opens up the possibility of a diagnostic that can detect and distinguish between two different viruses in a single sample.Gene editing is likely to remain at the center of Crispr\u2019s appeal, because so many are drawn by the idea of changing the genetic destiny of humans. But Dr. Doudna says the work on diagnostics is a chance to \u201ccircle back\u201d to the beginning of the discovery of the technology and create low-tech, inexpensive tools to diagnose disease. \u201cIt\u2019s tantalizing to go after that,\u201d she says.Ms. Dockser Marcus is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in Boston.

Participants could quickly see, for example, the beneficial effects of exercise or diet and adjust their behavior accordingly.Most of the studies were made possible by an open-source smartphone platform called ResearchKit, which was released free to researchers by             Apple Inc.       in 2015. Doctors and scientists can use it to create iPhone apps that collect data such as weight and blood pressure that are stored in the Health app on iPhones.Because many more cellphones, especially in less affluent areas and in developing countries, use the Android operating system, an Android version of the platform called ResearchStack was created by scientists at Cornell University. Sensing the utility of these devices,         Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Verily Life Sciences subsidiary recently unveiled a watch, called the Study Watch, that will collect data on users\u2019 heart rate and movement for studies of a number of diseases.Initially, five studies were launched in 2015 using ResearchKit, covering asthma, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Parkinson\u2019s. Studies involving epilepsy, autism and moles were added later, and a new Harvard Medical School study to monitor the health of National Football League players is just getting under way.Researchers have long worried that clinical studies in general are skewed because most are limited to areas around research hospitals, so the study group isn\u2019t a representative cross-section of the population. An even greater concern is that, except for the controlled conditions of laboratory research studies, most people have been at best lax about reporting health issues or downright dishonest about, say, how much exercise they get. The smartphone, on the other hand, can track activity and other health-related data passively and dispassionately.Following publicity about the studies, anyone could download the apps associated with the research. In nearly all the studies, thousands of people responded, many times more than the numbers for traditional studies. In all, the initial five studies involved a total of more than 50,000 people, including much larger cohorts from all 50 states than traditional research studies.Participants were asked a series of questions that helped determine their health status, which is similar to conventional studies; gave formal consent to being studied and sharing their data on the phone; and began using the phone\u2019s sensors to record things like how much activity they had each day. The data was collected and distributed to researchers by Sage Bionetworks, a Seattle health-tech firm that developed the sharing and security protocols for the studies.Following publication of the research studies this year, a number of researchers said they received inquiries from pharmaceutical firms interested in how they could use smartphones for clinical trials for drugs. \u201cThere is huge interest in the studies from pharma, who want us to help them deploy this kind of technology for clinical-trial populations,\u201d says       Eric Schadt,        director of the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who worked on the asthma study.In fact, British drugmaker         GlaxoSmithKline               has become the first pharmaceutical company to carry out a medical study using ResearchKit, tracking 300 rheumatoid-arthritis patients\u2019 fatigue, mood and joint pain over three months with data from iPhones. It hasn\u2019t yet released the results.Ray Dorsey,        a Parkinson\u2019s disease researcher at the Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics at the University of Rochester, says the Parkinson\u2019s study conducted by iPhone was a breakthrough not only because the researchers obtained consent from more than 9,500 patients over the phone, but also because the study\u2019s iPhone app, mPower, used four innovative tests to gauge the extent of the disease: It required the Parkinson\u2019s patients to tap the phone\u2019s screen as fast as they could; walk 20 steps, turn around, wait 30 seconds and take 20 steps again; take a memory test; and speak into the phone. Among other analytical tools, the app used an algorithm developed at Oxford University that can detect Parkinson\u2019s from a digital voice file with 98% accuracy.\u201cWe\u2019ve come up with a scale that\u2019s objective, continuous and can be done by anyone, anywhere and can provide a wealth of information on how people\u2019s symptoms vary, and use that to help manage their condition,\u201d Dr. Dorsey says.While all the phone-based studies were initially limited to the U.S., a number have reached overseas, such as the cardiovascular study, which is being rolled out in the U.K., Hong Kong and the Netherlands.One aspect of phone-based studies that researchers are trying to improve on: Many people drop out. The studies still end up with many more participants than traditional studies, but researchers would like to find a way to retain more of the people who initially sign on.Euan Ashley,        a researcher at Stanford University who worked on a cardiovascular study called MyHeart Counts, says about 5,000 people did the six-minute walk the app called for, the standard for measuring heart health. That was more than five times the number of people ever studied in a single group taking that test before. But more than 40,000 people who signed up for the app dropped out of the study before they got to the walk.\u201cThe bar for entry in these studies is very low,\u201d Dr. Ashley says. \u201cSo there is less adherence than in a clinical setting.\u201dResearchers say they are looking at ways to make the apps more engaging over time, such as giving users not only their own data, but also comparisons to other users in the same age or demographic group.Mr. Wallace is a writer in New York.

Clinicians would test some of the samples to see how he is responding to treatment for pancreatic cancer.But samples also were sent to a lab where computers using artificial intelligence are changing the way pharmaceutical companies develop drugs.The idea is that machines, which are adept at pattern recognition, can sift through vast amounts of new and existing genetic, metabolic and clinical information to unravel the complex biological networks that underpin diseases. That, in turn, can help identify medications likely to work in specific patient populations, while simultaneously steering companies away from drugs that are likely to fail.In the past, drug companies have used artificial intelligence to examine chemistry\u2014whether a drug might bind to a particular protein, for instance. But now the trend is to use AI to probe biological systems to get clues about how a drug might affect a patient\u2019s cells or tissues.Biological insights driven by machine learning also could help pharmaceutical companies better identify and recruit patients for clinical trials of therapies most likely to work for them, perhaps boosting the chances of those medications\u2019 getting approved by regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration.Data from the samples produced by Mr. Sanders, 64, a U.S. Navy veteran, will become part of the database in a $17 million, seven-year study known as Project Survival, bankrolled by Berg, a Framingham, Mass., biotech firm that is one of several companies in the U.S. and Europe using AI to make drug research and development less expensive and more efficient. Mr. Sanders says he agreed to take part in the study in hopes that it might \u201chelp the next person.\u201d Intelligent machines will scour his samples and genes, along with those of hundreds of other patients, for molecular fingerprints, or biomarkers, that could later be used to help measure a specific drug\u2019s impact and to identify patients in which such a drug is likely to be most useful.The big difference between AI-driven drug trials and traditional ones, says       Niven Narain,        chief executive of Berg, is \u201cwe\u2019re not making any hypotheses up front. We\u2019re not allowing [human] hypotheses to generate data. We\u2019re using the patient-derived data to generate hypotheses.\u201dProject Survival is part of a larger research program to develop therapies with the help of intelligent machines. Other efforts to leverage AI technology in pharmaceutical research include using it to find new drugs or new uses for already approved medications, as well as speeding up clinical trials by improving patient recruitment and site selection, according to a May 2017 report by analyst Datamonitor Healthcare.Some companies, such as Numerate Inc. in San Bruno, Calif., and BenevolentAI Ltd. in London, are developing their own molecules and licensing them to drug-industry clients. Others, such as             International Business Machines Corp.      , Atomwise Inc. in San Francisco and Insilico Medicine Inc. in Baltimore, are forming research partnerships with universities and nonprofits or setting up AI services aimed at drug companies.For example,             Merck                   & Co. is using Atomwise\u2019s deep-learning technology to identify compounds that could be developed into medications for neurological conditions, according to       David Rosen,        an associate principal scientist at Merck Research Labs in Palo Alto, Calif. Recently, there\u2019s been growing interest in leveraging this type of AI for health-care applications, in part due to the vast improvements deep learning has enabled in applications like machine translation and computer vision, which also rely on pattern recognition.In January,         GlaxoSmithKline               PLC and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., announced a partnership to use AI for pharmaceutical R&D. The consortium is in the process of securing work space in San Francisco and signing on other collaborators, according to       John Baldoni,        GSK\u2019s senior vice president of platform technology and science. The aim is to use AI to cut development time down to a single year, from more than 10 in some cases, he says.In Europe, scientists are getting ready to launch a similar initiative, which will include             Johnson & Johnson\u2019s       Janssen Pharmaceuticals division, plus several other drug companies and academic researchers, according to several people familiar with the matter. Janssen declined to comment on the partnership.The uptick in interest in AI is a convergence of a few forces, says Sastry Chilukuri, a partner in the pharmaceuticals and medical-products practice at the global consulting firm McKinsey & Co. These forces include the recent availability of \u201cenormous volumes of data,\u201d advances in computing power and AI algorithms, and the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s decadelong struggle with productivity in R&D, he says.The rise of precision, or personalized, medicine, is also putting pressure on drug developers, steering them away from a one-size-fits-all model.\u201cWe know that the same disease is not the same in every patient,\u201d says       Andrew Stern,        director of novel therapeutics at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Drug Discovery Institute. With care becoming more individualized, markets for some drugs are likely to \u201cbe relatively small compared to what we\u2019ve seen in the past with blockbusters,\u201d he says. But development costs are \u201cprobably not going to be that different\u201d if the R&D process stays the same, he adds.Hence the hope that AI will reduce the cost of developing new drugs. There is scant data so far to support the premise that AI will lower costs, partly because commercializing new medications takes so long and the recent move toward AI-aided biology is relatively new.\u201cR&D pipelines run for about a decade,\u201d says McKinsey\u2019s Mr. Chilukuri. Thus, benefits \u201cwill play out in the next 10 to 15 years,\u201d he says. The boost in value to the pharmaceutical industry in the medium term could be the equivalent of a 5% to 10% increase in sales, he says, though \u201clonger-term benefits will exceed that.\u201dSome drug developers say they\u2019re already seeing early benefits.Janssen uses AI in \u201cthe vast majority of projects,\u201d says       Hugo Ceulemans,        scientific director of discovery data sciences. AI systems trained on various data sources, including preclinical data sets, have helped make \u201csignificant performance improvements\u201d by enabling \u201cbetter selections of which compounds to\u2026make and test\u201d in the lab and by \u201cflagging\u201d whether compounds might have \u201ctoxic\u201d effects or \u201cunexpected favorable\u201d ones, he says.German pharmaceutical company         Merck KGaA               has developed two drugs using computer-vision software, which analyzes images of cells and tissues, and other AI systems capable of drawing insights from public databases of genetic and chemical information, says Joern-Peter Halle, Merck KGaA\u2019s head of external innovation. Merck KGaA operates in the U.S. as EMD Serono Inc.At Berg, Dr. Narain says AI has helped scientists \u201cdecide which cancers we were going to go after\u201d by helping them understand how a drug in clinical testing might work at the cellular level. Berg\u2019s system first identifies genetic and other markers among sick and well patients by drawing on detailed medical histories as well as data from scientific publications and chemical databases. It then ranks the genes, proteins or metabolites it finds according to their relevance to a particular disease, and determines when specific genes or proteins are associated with certain patient outcomes. Such screening is \u201cat least 50% cheaper\u201d than traditional methods, says Dr. Narain.Multiple hurdles must still be overcome for AI to fulfill its potential in pharmaceutical R&D. For instance, data sets, even within the same institutions, can be fragmented or stored in incompatible ways, making it difficult for machines to make sense of them unless significant efforts are made to harmonize the data, according to Olexandr Isayev, an assistant professor in machine learning at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.Data privacy is also a concern, scientists say, especially given recent cyberattacks on health systems around the world.Then, there\u2019s the drug-approval process, which requires data from animal and human experiments, making it unlikely computers will completely replace scientists soon.The FDA encourages companies \u201cto improve efficiency of identifying potent and safe molecules,\u201d says       Peter Stein,        deputy director of the office of new drugs at the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. But, he adds, FDA standards for clinical trials and the drug-approval process \u201care not different based upon the particular discovery strategy.\u201dMs. Hernandez is a reporter for The Wall Street journal in New York.

Totally forgot about that dentist appointment? If you\u2019re past middle age and really want to hang on to your memory, swap the Sudoku and crossword puzzles for a good night\u2019s sleep.Many studies have made the connection between sleep and memory consolidation\u2014the brain\u2019s ability to cement short-term memories into longer-term ones, so they can be recalled the next day. But as we age, deep, refreshing slumber can be as elusive as those misplaced car keys.Thus, an experimental technology that enhances sleep, according to the Northwestern University scientists who developed it, could present a breakthrough for older people suffering memory loss. In a series of tests, researchers at Northwestern found that when \u201cpink noise\u201d\u2014an engineered sound that scientists say is more soothing than the better-known white noise\u2014was delivered in short bursts during sleep, older people showed better cognitive function after waking than they did after a night without pink noise.Pink noise, which is a composite of sounds, differs from white noise because each of its individual sounds carries the same frequency, unlike notes in music, say, whose frequencies double with each higher octave. In short, the frequencies are more balanced than white noise.\u201cThis is a simple, safe, non-pharmacological approach\u201d to improving one\u2019s memory, says       Phyllis Zee,        a professor of neurology at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern and senior author of the study, published recently in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. What the study showed, she and her co-authors say, is that acoustics can be used to enhance the quality of older people\u2019s sleep, and can improve their memory in the bargain.Earlier research by       Jan Born       and colleagues at the University of Lubeck in Germany found a link between acoustic stimulation and deep sleep (also known as slow-wave sleep) in young adults. His group found that subjecting the sleepers to pink noise enhanced slow-wave brain activity.But until now, such studies in the elderly population\u2014the group with the most difficulty getting sleep, and thus at highest risk for memory impairment\u2014have been lacking, Dr. Zee says.In the Northwestern study, 13 healthy men and women between 60 and 84 were monitored as they slept on two nights about one week apart. Each person was subjected to pink noise on just one of those nights, though they were not aware of this, as a control. The sample size was \u201crelatively small,\u201d due to the unusual demands placed on the subjects\u2019 time, but this didn\u2019t bias the results, Dr. Zee says, because each person experienced both the actual stimulation and a night of no noise, thus reducing the variables involved.While the subjects slept, their brain waves were monitored using electroencephalography, which recorded their neural activity and sent the information to a computer. The pink-noise bursts were played through headphones at specific intervals, synchronized according to each subject\u2019s brain waves.To measure the acoustic stimulation\u2019s effect on memory, the participants were tested on 88 word pairs before they went to sleep, and again in the morning. On average, word recall following the nights of pink noise was about three times as great as it was after the noiseless nights.\u201cThe advantage of our algorithm is that it\u2019s individualized and automatic, adjusting to each person\u2019s sound-wave sleep, which can differ from night to night,\u201d says       Roneil Malkani,        an assistant professor of neurology at Northwestern and a co-investigator. \u201cThe timing is important to get the most beneficial effect.\u201dRobert Stickgold,        associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who wasn\u2019t involved in the Northwestern research, calls the results \u201cvery impressive.\u201d But questions remain about whether such an intervention would keep us mentally nimble, says Mr. Stickgold, who is also director of the Center for Sleep and Cognition at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\u201cSleep enhances other kind of memories as well\u2014like emotional memories,\u201d he says. \u201cMy concern is by concentrating only on this one kind of memory, we could be potentially impairing other types of memory where research has not been done and where there is no data.\u201dThe Northwestern researchers are doing more testing in young and older adults to see how acoustic stimulation might perform over a longer period, including one study in patients with mild cognitive impairment, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, Alzheimer\u2019s Association and Illinois Department of Public Health. A patent is pending for the pink-noise algorithm, and the researchers plan on developing devices for home use in the near future.Ms. Rubin is a writer in Chicago.

But he has never liked the way the white fluorescent tape on the cane draws attention to the user\u2019s disability, acting like a beacon for unsolicited offers of help. He resists the device\u2019s history as a symbol for the blind, a label Mr. Papalia refuses, referring to himself instead as a \u201cnonvisual learner.\u201d The cane is socially isolating, he says.After Mr. Papalia got his first cane at age 22, a friend painted a realistic looking eyeball on the rolling tip. When Mr. Papalia walked down the street, people noticed the glistening eyeball sweeping along and often started a conversation with him. When the painted eyeball wore off, Mr. Papalia, an artist who lives in Vancouver, kept experimenting. He built canes 15 to 30 feet long, representative of how he often feels conspicuous in public. He peeled the white tape off some of his canes to the graphite below. He even ditched the cane for a few experiments, using a megaphone to solicit directions, and another time walking around a city with a high-school marching band that gave him musical cues. Mr. Papalia knew he wanted a different kind of cane. But mainly, he came to realize, he sought to create a different type of interaction with the people around him.\u201cThe cane is something I use every day,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I hold this implement, I need to constantly think through my position within the community.\u201dIn 2015, Mr. Papalia reached out to       Sara Hendren,        an artist and assistant professor of design at Olin College, a 350-student engineering school in Needham, Mass., a quiet Boston suburb. Ms. Hendren, who runs the Adaptation and Ability Group, a research lab at the college that mixes art and engineering, pushes the notion that engineering isn\u2019t only about finding cures for disability but also about accommodating differences.Ms. Hendren\u2019s interest in the topic was sparked by the birth of the first of her three children, a son with Down syndrome who is now 11 years old. She appreciated how assistive technology, a growing field in health, might broaden her son\u2019s experiences. But she also believes products should be made in collaboration with people who use them, \u201cin service of their wishes,\u201d she says, \u201cnot in answer to someone\u2019s ideas of their predetermined needs.\u201dHer lab at Olin is conceived as an outgrowth of rehabilitation engineering, a field that emerged in the post-World War II era to address the needs of injured veterans returning from war. Ms. Hendren says she doesn\u2019t reject powerful technological advances that improve lives. But she views the lab as a place where \u201cengineering as problem solving lives with engineering as question asking.\u201dIn Ms. Hendren\u2019s class, \u201cImagining Normal,\u201d which examines different approaches to adaptive technology, student engineers worked with the dancer and choreographer       Alice Sheppard,        who uses a wheelchair, to create a specially designed ramp, not to ensure better access, but as a feature the dancer wanted to incorporate into her performances. They helped create a carbon-fiber, collapsible, lightweight lectern for       Amanda Cachia,        an art historian and curator. Ms. Cachia, who is 4 feet 3 inches tall, wanted a lectern suitable for her height that could be collapsed and easily packed in a suitcase when she traveled to give lectures. \u201cArtifacts make possible new conceptual ideas and new ways of thinking about the world,\u201d Ms. Hendren says. \u201cWe live in a time where it is profoundly unclear what normal is.\u201dWhen Mr. Papalia, a friend of Ms. Cachia\u2019s, learned about the work on the \u201cAlterpodium,\u201d he contacted Ms. Hendren. He was eager to try a similar approach with his cane. \u201cI saw this cane as an opportunity to collaborate,\u201d he says.He told Ms. Hendren he wanted an \u201cacoustic mobility device,\u201d an object that produces sounds to reflect the world as he taps. Mr. Papalia agreed with Ms. Hendren\u2019s emphasis to the students that canes shouldn\u2019t be viewed either as a purely medical object or a sign of tragedy, but one more piece of a puzzle in a different lived experience, a reflection of Mr. Papalia\u2019s rich, complicated, joyful life. \u201cThey were meeting me where I was,\u201d Mr. Papalia says. \u201cI was meeting them where they were. We tried to understand how we might navigate the space between us.\u201dDuring a five-day visit to Olin in 2015, Mr. Papalia did a presentation of his work, including a showing of the video of his walk with the megaphone. He talked to the students about his daily life, sharing his experiences using a cane, among them incidents involving what he calls \u201cthe disruptive aspect of being disabled in a public space.\u201d The students came up with a list of 400 possible ideas for a new device. Some were fanciful, such as a cane that could make automated comments as people walked by like \u201cnice hat\u201d or \u201ccool shoes.\u201d The student engineers ultimately presented Mr. Papalia with a prototype of a cane with a microphone attached to the tip and a battery-powered amplification device with knobs for tuning the sound. The sound system looks a bit like a large radio when clipped to Mr. Papalia\u2019s body.The microphone on the tip of the cane picks up the sounds and scraping Mr. Papalia makes, depending on whether he is walking on carpet, wood or stone floors, or outside in the terrain. The device that the cane connects to allows him to distort the sound. Friends who are musicians encourage Mr. Papalia to plug the cane into their speaker systems and mixing boards, experimenting with ways to integrate the sounds of his experiences into music.Even though Mr. Papalia says he was thrilled with the result, he was moved when Ms. Hendren assured him that the cane, like an iPhone or any other piece of technology, could go through many versions.\u201cI get to call when I feel the cane is done,\u201d he says.Last month, Mr. Papalia decided it was time for a redesign.       Daniel Leong       and       Samantha Kumarasena,        former Olin students who worked on the original version and graduated in 2016, come back to campus for a brainstorming session with Mr. Papalia and Ms. Hendren. In the fall, when classes start again, a new group of students will continue to work with Mr. Papalia to refine and produce the next cane.Mr. Papalia explains that their creation \u201cis fun to use,\u201d but that he needs something less cumbersome. The sound-modulating box is too large to hold comfortably. He wants the cane to be more like a musical instrument he can play.Mr. Leong grabs a piece of white butcher paper and starts sketching ideas as Mr. Papalia talks. Ms. Hendren stands at a whiteboard, a prototype for the latest version starting to take shape. They consider adding some kind of universal jack so that Mr. Papalia can plug in the cane and collaborate with musicians, using his cane as a performance instrument. They wonder if they can replace the wire in the cane with a stretchable elastic cord so he can fold the device more easily. Mr. Papalia wants more microphones, perhaps spread along the length of the cane, to \u201camplify my presence\u201d when he enters a room.Ms. Kumarasena, who majored in electrical and computer engineering at Olin but plans to attend medical school in the fall, jots the specifications down into a small notebook. She recalls how during Mr. Papalia\u2019s previous visit to Olin, he took Ms. Kumarasena and other students on a walk around campus. The students lined up, put a hand on the shoulder of the person in front of them, and shut their eyes as the artist led them around campus, urging them to make their way relying on their nonvisual senses. \u201cI had a very naive view of the challenges surrounding accessibility,\u201d she says. \u201cI saw engineering as a way to \u2018fix\u2019 a disability.\u201dNow Ms. Kumarasena approaches the project as a venue for collaboration between people who want to share the same public space. Ms. Kumarasena looks up from her notes and says to Mr. Papalia, \u201cYou seem to want a playable instrument that replicates sounds and experiences.\u201dMr. Papalia nods in agreement; for now, that image sustains him. Long ago, he says he realized his goal isn\u2019t just the creation of a better cane, but a better community, one in which \u201cI don\u2019t feel marginalized or reduced.\u201d Both, he recognizes, are likely to remain works in progress.Reflecting on the plans that emerge from the latest design session, Mr. Papalia says, \u201cI think the cane we are working on now is pointing in the direction I want to go. But the cane I want to hold in my hand may never be finished.\u201dMs. Dockser Marcus is a Wall Street Journal reporter in Boston.

Thanks in part to the availability of accurate heart-rate data on wearable devices, it\u2019s being used in training by soccer, basketball and football players, among others, from the elite to the weekend warrior. Psychologists are using it to train golfers and tennis players to control their heartbeats so they\u2019re calmer under pressure. And some see managing heart-rate variability as a way for nonathletes to deal with stress.By learning how to control their respiration with slow, rhythmical breaths, people can temporarily increase their heart-rate variability, which some medical experts say can help lower blood pressure and reduce stress and anxiety. This technique has also been used to treat everything from stage fright to irritable bowel syndrome.While your heartbeat might seem steady at any given time\u2014whether your heart is beating fast because of strenuous activity or slower because you\u2019re at rest\u2014there are actually tiny variations in the time between beats. That variability is due to the interplay of the two arms of the autonomic nervous system, the part of the nervous system that controls bodily functions, including the heartbeat, without a person\u2019s conscious direction.Those two arms are the parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous systems, says       Lawrence Creswell,        a cardiac surgeon in Jackson, Miss., who studies sports cardiology. \u201cThe sympathetic arm has to do with getting adrenaline flowing, revving up the heartbeat,\u201d Dr. Creswell says. \u201cThe parasympathetic autonomic system is the brakes and pulls down the heart rate.\u201dThe balance between those two systems is in constant flux. After a hard workout, the parasympathetic system dominates as the body demands rest. This is associated with a decline in heart-rate variability. As the body gets the rest it needs, the sympathetic nervous system takes the upper hand, preparing the body for renewed activity. When that happens, heart-rate variability increases. Dr. Creswell says that in sports training, the idea is to have your heaviest workouts when your heart is most recovered\u2014when your HRV is at its highest.That number won\u2019t be the same for everyone. The range of HRV numbers differs from person to person.       Alan Couzens,        a Boulder, Colo., coach who trains competitive athletes, says it takes about a month of monitoring your HRV to establish a baseline before you can use it to determine your recovery status.Mr. Couzens uses HRV data that athletes send him to help set their training schedules. On days when an athlete\u2019s HRV number is down, he orders up a light training day or, rarely, a day off\u2014because low HRV is a sign that the body is still stressed, and pushing it too hard in that state might result in physical damage. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good measure of the health of the athlete,\u201d Mr. Couzens says. \u201cA drop in HRV often precedes injuries.\u201dDoctors and psychologists, meanwhile, have been studying HRV as an indicator of physical and mental health, and how altering it can benefit patients.       Richard Gevirtz,        a professor of health psychology at Alliant International University in San Diego, says training people to raise their HRV is being used successfully to treat stress-related disorders like anxiety, gastrointestinal problems such as irritable bowel syndrome, and work issues like fear of giving a speech.Dr. Gevirtz has developed a program that uses slow, methodical breathing to increase HRV. He says studies show that each individual has a different breathing rate, usually between five and seven breaths a minute, at which they obtain maximum HRV, which has a calming effect. The research has shown that breathing at that rate can raise a person\u2019s average HRV by 25% over time, he says.An analysis of several peer-reviewed studies of heart-rate training using rhythmic breathing was published in March in the journal Psychological Medicine. It concluded that \u201cHRV biofeedback training is associated with a large reduction in self-reported stress and anxiety.\u201dHarry van der Lei,        co-founder of the Hourglass Performance Institute in Atlanta, says training to control HRV with breathing can improve performance in golf, tennis and shooting\u2014sports where performance anxiety can cause even seasoned pros to miss shots. \u201cBy increasing your HRV, you are increasing your stress-management capacity,\u201d he says.Mr. van der Lei\u2019s company teaches golfers how to improve their HRV under conditions of pressure and stress such as tournaments. But he adds that while HRV training can enhance skills an athlete already has, it isn\u2019t a substitute for those skills.Measuring HRV is simple. Several smartphone apps provide detailed HRV measures and tracking using data from wearable heart-rate monitors. Another alternative is an earlobe clip called Inner Balance, which plugs into a smartphone and displays HRV data on-screen.There are also several apps people can use to train themselves to regulate their breathing to raise their HRV and lower stress and anxiety. Practitioners recommend 20 minutes a day of breathing practice to obtain the full benefit.Mr. Wallace is a writer in New York.

Would they make better decisions if the choices were presented in a different way?That\u2019s the idea behind so-called choice architecture, or presenting options in a way that subtly encourages people toward a desired decision. Based on psychology and behavioral economics, it aims to encourage people to make better choices without openly limiting their options.Often referred to as a \u201cnudge,\u201d choice architecture is widely used in personal finance. To encourage people to invest in 401(k)s, for example, many employers automatically deduct contributions from paychecks unless a worker specifies otherwise.Now, health-care providers and payers increasingly are incorporating principles of choice architecture in their dealings with patients and doctors, with the aim of cutting costs while preserving patient autonomy.For example, some states encourage child vaccinations by making it difficult for parents to opt out. They may require a doctor\u2019s signature or a trip to a government office to sign an unvaccinated child up for school. Elsewhere, insurers and hospitals may encourage doctors to prescribe a generic drug over an expensive one by displaying the generic more prominently on a form.While research suggests that choice architecture can be a powerful tool, it also raises concerns that it could be used by insurers and hospitals to advance their own interests rather than the patient\u2019s.That question is the among the issues examined in a recent book, \u201cNudging Health: Health Law and Behavioral Economics,\u201d edited by       Christopher T. Robertson,        an associate dean and law-school professor at the University of Arizona;       I. Glenn Cohen,        professor at Harvard Law School and faculty director of the law school\u2019s Petrie-Flom Center; and       Holly Fernandez       Lynch, executive director of the Petrie-Flom Center.The Wall Street Journal spoke with Prof. Robertson about using choice architecture in health care. Edited excerpts follow:WSJ: How can choice architecture be used to help people make better health-care decisions?PROF. ROBERTSON: Only about 30% of Americans have advance-care directives where they make decisions about future treatment in case they are ever incapacitated. One way to get more people to do advance directives is by making it a condition for buying health insurance or a way to earn a discount on their policies. Research shows that individuals [with such directives] often chose care that\u2019s less intensive, invasive, and therefore less expensive, than is otherwise presumed. So this is an example of where policy makers have an interest in helping people make decisions that better reflect their own preferences.WSJ: Do nudges work when people have an array of options from which to choose?PROF. ROBERTSON:Think of a corporate cafeteria. If the company wants employees to eat more fruits or vegetables, it should put them at eye level. It also can place sugary desserts off to the side where people have to seek them out. One important aspect of choice architecture, based on key insights from behavioral science, is to make the good choice the easy choice.There also is an assumption that it is better to have more choices, but studies from behavioral science show people are often befuddled by too many choices. They can suffer from overload and become stressed and confused, so the added choices don\u2019t improve outcomes or satisfaction.So I think curating choices can add a lot of value. For example, buying health insurance is impossibly complex because there are thousands of options, but by creating levels of coverage\u2014bronze, silver, gold\u2014the Affordable Care Act simplified the process. Patients may end up having only a handful of plans from which to choose, but they can make apples-to-apples comparisons and buy a plan better reflecting their actual preferences.WSJ: Why is choice architecture better than traditional incentives?PROF. ROBERTSON: To get doctors to prescribe more generic drugs, they could be offered a carrot, like a bonus based on the number of generic drugs prescribed, or a stick, forbidding them to write more than a certain number of brand-name prescriptions. But these incentives are demeaning. They overtly undermine physicians\u2019 discretion, and it\u2019s hard to calibrate the quality of the decision, especially because it creates a conflict of interest. But nudges, in which physicians are required to scroll down farther or sign an extra form to prescribe a name-brand drug, create a small inconvenience that might shift physician behavior toward a path of least resistance, but it maintains their discretion.WSJ: One critique of choice architecture in health care is that it may work in the best interests of the government, hospital system or insurer, rather than the patient. Do you see that as a problem?PROF. ROBERTSON: With health care, all decisions have larger implications. If a physician is writing too many brand-name prescriptions, it isn\u2019t just the patient\u2019s interest. Everyone in the same insurance pool and the taxpayers subsidizing the insurance pool [would benefit] if the doctor prescribed fewer brand-name drugs. So it is perfectly fair to keep all perspectives in mind.It\u2019s also important to understand that there is often no way to avoid choice architecture\u2014people are pushed in a direction to make a decision regardless. The question is: Are you doing it accidentally or purposely? Why is it OK to do this accidentally, without a plan, and do patients harm, but it isn\u2019t OK to better facilitate decisions?WSJ: Can you provide an example?PROF. ROBERTSON: In the U.S., people have to go out and find health-insurance coverage, and the path of least resistance is to not get it. In other countries people are covered automatically. That\u2019s the irony of the Affordable Care Act. Although it has a mandate to get coverage, it really has preserved the option to not be covered since it requires people to opt in to avoid the penalty. A slightly stronger version would default people into coverage, charging a premium rather than a penalty, while allowing people to opt out. There have been proposals as part of health-care reform to do this because it would repeal the mandate and preserve the choice to be uninsured, while at the same time potentially causing more people to be insured through automatic enrollment.WSJ:  Can choice architecture go awry?PROF. ROBERTSON: Nudges can be designed poorly. Several states require people applying for a driver\u2019s license to decide if they want to be organ donors. It turns out the DMV isn\u2019t a very good place to make such decisions. People are in a hurry and the last thing they want is to spend more time contemplating their own deaths. When forced into a corner, people are more likely to just say no, which undermines the policy goal. So the nudges backfired.One of the larger themes of the book is that these are just ideas or proposals that need to be first tested in the lab and then tested in the field. The science of nudging itself is still in its infancy, and we are learning a lot more about what works and where.WSJ: Are there other pitfalls?PROF. ROBERTSON: Nudges may have a small effect when there are structural or systematic problems that need to be addressed.Merely putting healthy food in the right places or disclosing nutrition information on food labels is unlikely to solve [the obesity problem because the U.S. has] larger, fundamental problems: The government subsidizes unhealthy food, and many people lack access to fresh fruits and vegetables.Ms. Ward is a writer in Mendham, N.J.

Andrew Cuomo\u2019s       pledge to make government work and his knack for easing partisan gridlock are facing new headwinds ahead of his re-election campaign next year.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, ended his seventh legislative session last week with important matters unresolved and lawmakers pointing fingers. Earlier in the year, lawmakers were days late in completing the budget, the longest delay of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s tenure.It is unclear whether legislators will reconvene for a special session to try to break an impasse over a number of issues, including Mayor       Bill de Blasio\u2019s       authority over New York City schools, and the rate of sales taxes in New York counties. On Sunday, Mr. Cuomo said he hopes to do so before July.The stalemate marks a contrast from past years when the Democratic governor won concessions from both parties by his deadline. And it undercuts one of his top political talking points, that he can oil the wheels of government, said analysts, officials, lobbyists and others involved in state politics.These people attributed Mr. Cuomo\u2019s new difficulties prodding legislators to his lengthening time in office and natural tensions that arise between the branches, and to changes in legislative leadership. They said it is an open question how the dynamic will affect 2018. Mr. Cuomo has said he will run again; Republicans said they plan to run on a reform platform against the two-term incumbent.\u201cMario Cuomo is reported to have said that in politics friends are fleeting and enemies accumulate,\u201d said Blair Horner, the director of government watchdog New York Public Interest Research Group and a longtime Albany observer. \u201cThat is what you\u2019re seeing, and I think it will consistently get harder.\u201dA spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo said: \u201cGov. Cuomo\u2019s record of results speaks for itself\u2014passing more on-time budgets than any other governor in modern political history and delivering major progressive victories year after year.\u201dAt a news conference last week, Mr. Cuomo said his accomplishments for the year were largely hashed out in the state budget in April, including softening criminal penalties against minors and offering free college tuition for some middle-class families.After that, \u201cWe got to every issue, we just don\u2019t have agreement on every issue,\u201d he said. He mostly blamed the Legislature, saying lawmakers were derelict in their duties for going home without resolving pressing matters.The governor faces new legislative dynamics as he tries to make a three-way deal. The state Senate is unusually fractured, because nine dissident Democrats keep the Republicans in control of the chamber, even though Democrats have a numerical majority.In the Assembly, Democratic Speaker       Carl Heastie       appears less eager to cut deals than former Speaker       Sheldon Silver,        also a Democrat.\u201cIt\u2019s clear the Assembly is changing its approach,\u201d said Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat. \u201cWhy should we let bad policies be enacted into law all the time?\u201dMr. Cuomo has said he will work with whoever is in power.In 2010, he ran as a reformer, calling state government \u201ca mess\u201d and the legislative process \u201ca disgrace.\u201d In 2014, he said his Republican challenger would \u201cbring back hyperpartisan gridlock.\u201dThroughout his tenure, Mr. Cuomo has worked closely with both parties and been credited with restoring some orderliness to state government. But legislators and political strategists said that time may be ending, and Republican critics are seizing on the tensions in Albany.Assembly Minority Leader Brian Kolb, an upstate Republican, said this session had been rife with \u201cchaos.\u201dJessica Proud,        a Republican strategist who worked on       Rob Astorino\u2019s       2014 GOP gubernatorial race against Mr. Cuomo, said she expects cleaning up Albany \u201cto be a main issue in next year\u2019s election.\u201dShe said Mr. Cuomo benefited from entering office on the heels of scandals and chaos following the resignation of Gov.       Eliot Spitzer,        but \u201cthe veneer is coming off.\u201dStill, Mr. Cuomo is a relatively popular figure in New York with an approval rating hovering around 60% in recent polls, and he would likely be the front-runner in the 2018 governor\u2019s race.Mel Miller, a political consultant and former Assembly Speaker, said there is \u201cresidual anger\u201d between the Legislature and Mr. Cuomo after past battles, but he cautioned that the tensions are healthy.Mr. Miller said the state government is not dysfunctional yet. \u201cCompared to Congress,\u201d he said, \u201cit is elegant.\u201dWrite to Mike Vilensky at mike.vilensky@dowjones.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Governor Hits Impasse Over Albany Agenda.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 21:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gov-andrew-cuomo-faces-new-struggles-to-move-albany-1498436820", "news_title": "Gov.

Allen,        are using satellites to fight illegal fishing\u2014which causes billions of dollars a year in commercial losses and depletes stocks.With the world\u2019s third-largest fishery zone covering 3.5 million square miles, Australia is at the forefront of efforts to combat poaching. Its patrol ships have chased illegal trawlers almost as far as South Africa, a distance of 4,600 miles, to stop the plunder of prized Patagonian toothfish\u2014sold in the U.S. as Chilean sea bass.Australian government scientists and Vulcan Inc., Mr. Allen\u2019s private company, have developed a notification system that alerts authorities when suspected pirate vessels from West Africa arrive at ports on remote Pacific islands and South America.The system, announced Sunday U.S. time, relies on anticollision transponders installed on nearly all oceangoing craft as a requirement under maritime law. These devices are detectable by satellite.A statistical model helps identify vessels whose transponders have been intentionally shut off. Other data identifies fishing boats that are loitering in risk areas, such as near national maritime boundaries.\u201cWe can shine a spotlight on vessels acting suspiciously based on factors including the vessel\u2019s history, movement and whether its transmitter has been intentionally disabled,\u201d said Chris Wilcox, who helped develop the system for Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization.\u201cOn one hand you can\u2019t see them [if their transponder is switched off], but on the other it means they\u2019ve just flagged themselves as avoiding surveillance, and as a risk indicator, that\u2019s at the top of the list,\u201d he said.Illegal fishing is estimated to account for 11% to 19% of the global catch, according to Australia\u2019s government and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. And a third of all fish sold in the U.S. is believed to be caught illegally.Seafood consumption in wealthy nations has soared in recent decades, increasing reliance on imports. Between 1980 and 2014, U.S. seafood consumption rose 60%, with imports now meeting 90% of the demand, according to Global Fishing Watch and the World Wildlife Fund.Illegal fishing can be highly lucrative because violators don\u2019t pay duties or taxes on their illegal catches. And it is nearly impossible to detect illegally caught products when they enter the global seafood market, Dr. Wilcox said.Poachers ignore catch quotas intended to protect species from overfishing and use outlawed equipment, including nets stretching 15 miles or more that scoop up everything in their path. Illegal fishing causes commercial losses of up to $23 billion a year world-wide, according to the U.N.Nearly half the world\u2019s population relies on seafood as their primary source of protein, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization says, and demand is expected to grow. Fish exports were valued at about $148 billion in 2014, U.N. statistics show.The researchers\u2019 satellite-based tracking tool will begin operating in October and will be free to access. It was set up in response to a treaty aimed at eradicating illegal fishing that came into force last June. The Agreement on Port State Measures had agreement from 29 countries, including African nations previously linked to illegal fishing.\u201cCountries that use this new tool will now be able to reverse the tide of illegal fishing and help rebuild depleted fish stocks,\u201d said Mark Powell, illegal fishing program officer for Vulcan.China is the world\u2019s largest seafood producer, followed by Indonesia, the U.S. and Russia. The most critical area for poaching is off the coast of West Africa, where illegal, unauthorized and unregulated fishing accounts an estimated 40% of fish caught, according to the World Ocean Review. Other areas of concern include the western and southern Pacific and the southwest Atlantic. Illegal trawlers contribute to overfishing that threatens marine ecosystems and food security in some of the poorest countries.Last year, Argentina\u2019s coast guard opened fire on and sank a Chinese trawler that was fishing illegally in its waters. South Korea\u2019s coast guard fired on Chinese poachers several months later.Australian authorities have said geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea, a rich fishing ground, may be driving more illegal fishing vessels into the South Pacific from China, Taiwan and Vietnam.Write to Rob Taylor at rob.taylor@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Satellites Help Reel In Fish Poachers.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 21:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trawling-scientists-find-a-better-way-to-reel-in-fish-poachers-1498399263", "news_title": "Trawling Scientists Find a Better Way to Reel In Illegal Fishing ", "keywords": "australia fishing news ,environmental news ,fish stocks ,global fishing industry ,illegal fishing ,paul g. allen,Vulcan,Paul G.

Same-sex couples show off wedding rings. Gay members of the military openly kiss their partners.But the celebratory mood has dimmed\u00a0this year.Now, gay pride events across the country have become the stage for a battle over what the gay-rights movement\u2019s priorities should be\u2014particularly under a Republican administration that has taken steps to roll back protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.The outcome of these conflicts could help set the agenda for a movement that has had significant impact on the nation\u2019s politics and culture.The movement\u2019s two biggest political goals of the last 20 years\u2014the legalization of same-sex marriage and the right for gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military\u2014have been achieved, leaving an opening at the top of the\u00a0docket.\u00a0Activists\u00a0are now fighting about what events like LGBT-pride marches should stand for,\u00a0and who should have a say in that decision.In one city after another, pride parades have been disrupted by\u00a0gay and transgender\u00a0activists who say\u00a0the needs of many in the community\u2014especially LGBT people who are racial minorities\u2014have been sidelined.In Washington, D.C., the parade was rerouted because protesters took over the street, denounced\u00a0the corporate influence on the event and demanded more representation for people of color on the Pride board of directors. In Phoenix, protesters demanded the LGBT community do more to protect undocumented immigrants\u00a0and transgender people.Protesters\u00a0with similar demands\u00a0disrupted the pride parade in Boston and staged\u00a0a counter-parade in Pittsburgh. At Columbus Pride in Ohio, the parade turned violent: four protesters were arrested, and four police officers were injured in the scuffle.The discord is now spilling into public view, activists said,\u00a0because\u00a0LGBT people are worried that gains achieved under former President       Barack Obama       will be reversed under a Republican administration.Already, the administration of President       Donald Trump       has revoked federal guidelines allowing transgender students to use the public school bathrooms that match their gender identities; the administration preserved an executive order banning anti-gay bias by federal contractors, but removed the requirement the businesses prove they don\u2019t discriminate.\u201cThese tensions have been simmering for years,\u201d said       Andrea Bowen,        a transgender activist and former executive director of Garden State Equality, an LGBT rights group in New Jersey. \u201cWe\u2019re simply seeing them come to the fore because we\u2019ve had these rising expectations, and now we\u2019re in this period of drought.\u201dDespite recent political successes, some LGBT people believe pride has strayed from its original purpose: a protest on the first anniversary of the Stonewall Inn riots in New York,\u00a0considered the beginning of the nation\u2019s gay-rights movement.Martin Duberman,        a gay historian, said the early marches were \u201centirely political,\u201d but the events\u00a0have\u00a0become increasingly corporate and commercial.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to see them turn the whole national movement around,\u201d he said, \u201cand start paying attention to a host of issues that have been sublimated under the guise of winning acceptance.\u201dProtesters say they are aiming to do just that. At Capitol Pride in Washington, demonstrators\u2019 demands included an end to corporate partnerships with big banks and defense contractors and a ban on uniformed law-enforcement officers marching in the parade.Jen Deerinwater,        a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and one of the protest organizers, said Capitol Pride should be working on an array of progressive causes\u2014from Native American sovereignty to police violence in black communities\u2014that affect non-white LGBT people.\u201cThe fight for marriage equality wasn\u2019t a fight I cared much about,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce they had marriage equality,\u201d she said of many gays and lesbians, \u201cthey weren\u2019t here for my community.\u201dLongtime activists, however, said the protests ignored the progress that had been made and the growing focus many LGBT groups have put on transgender issues.\u00a0Last fall, Human Rights Campaign spent millions in a successful effort\u00a0to unseat North Carolina Governor       Pat McCrory       after he signed a bill regulating transgender public bathroom use.Cathy Renna,        a spokeswoman for Capitol Pride, said she didn\u2019t think Pride was the right place to stake out policy positions: It was designed to be a place where all LGBT people, including gay Republicans and police officers, are welcome.\u201cI understand there are anti-war people in this community, but there are also military veterans,\u201d she said.As floats passed by along Fifth Avenue in New York on Sunday, the atmosphere was festive, though the crowd was dotted with handmade signs with slogans like \u201cresist\u201d\u2014a reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Mayor       Bill de Blasio,        Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       and Sen. Chuck Schumer, all Democrats, showed up to march.Gay pride events\u2014which in some cities cost north of $1 million, and draw tens of thousands of people\u2014are now impossible without corporate sponsorships. In Pittsburgh, the annual pride parade was called the             EQT                   Equality March this year, with the naming rights going to EQT Corp., a fracking company.The events also have become increasingly family friendly in what some activists see as a sign that Pride has lost its political edge.In New York, Isabella Piccone, a 15-year-old from Bedminster, N.J., came with her father and five teenage friends wearing silver glitter makeup on their cheeks.\u201cWe\u2019ve been so excited about this community, and different kinds of people coming together to show their love,\u201d Ms. Piccone said. \u201cWith our new government, it\u2019s important for people to feel safe and like they can be themselves.\u201dOrganizers of the events say that, decades ago, when major companies regularly fired openly gay employees, LGBT people would have been thrilled to have corporate sponsors at Pride.\u201cWhen we see corporatization, we see more and more stronger support from the business community for LGBT rights,\u201d said       Sylvain Bruni,        president of Boston Pride, which was disrupted this month by protests over corporate influence.Some places, however, are making room for protesters.In Philadelphia, Pride organizers added two more colors\u2014black and brown\u2014to the traditional rainbow Pride flag, in an effort to show that people of color\u00a0are\u00a0a valued part of the community.In Los Angeles, the annual pride parade was rebranded the \u201cResist March.\u201d Thousands gathered to show their opposition to any attempt to roll back the rights. Organizers raised money from donors, so the march could forego corporate sponsorships.At San Francisco\u2019s Pride parade this weekend, the procession was led by a \u201cresistance contingent\u201d of activist groups.\u201cThe most marginalized and most oppressed are really starting to step up and confront racial injustices,\u201d       Michelle Meow,        president of the San Francisco Pride board, said. \u201cNot only in general society, but in the LGBT community.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   Garden State Equality is an advocacy group in New Jersey.

In 2015, U.S. businesses paid in all $1.3 trillion\u00a0in gross\u00a0interest, according to Commerce Department data, equal in magnitude to the total economic output of Australia.Getting rid of the deduction for net interest expense, as House Republicans propose, would alter finance. It also would generate about $1.5 trillion in revenue for the government over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning think thank.The plan would raise money to help offset Republicans\u2019 corporate tax cuts and reduce a \u201chuge bias\u201d toward debt financing, said       Robert Pozen,        a senior lecturer at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management. That bias, he said, hurts companies built around innovation, which tend to not have the physical assets that banks usually require as collateral.\u201cWhat we\u2019re proposing is to take the tax preference from the source of funds\u2014borrowing\u2014and take that preference to the use of funds\u2014business investment and buildings, equipment, software, technology,\u201d\u00a0Rep.       Kevin Brady       (R., Texas), the author of the plan, said at The Wall Street Journal CFO network conference this month.In a world with no interest deduction, debt-fueled leveraged buyouts by private-equity titans could become more expensive to finance and junk bonds less appealing.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily bad for society,\u201d said David Beim, a retired Columbia University finance professor. \u201cWe have too much systemic financial risk in our economy.\u201dThe dollar size of repealing the net-interest-expense deduction is even larger than another controversial proposal being pushed by House Republicans known as border adjustment, which would tax imports and exempt exports. The border adjustment plan has been under attack from retailers and Republican senators, whose resistance has put it on the brink of failure. But the idea of eliminating or limiting the interest deduction has generated less vocal opposition, giving it a real chance of\u00a0passage, perhaps in a scaled-back form.Republicans are aiming to agree on a framework for tax policy by September and send a bill to President       Donald Trump       this year. It will be an uphill fight fraught with intraparty political divides, and companies who want to keep the interest deduction will have plenty of clout.For some debt-reliant businesses, the interest deduction\u2019s demise could be a blow. Crop growers who depend on bridge loans to work through seasonal business fluctuations could face higher tax bills.Andy Hill, who farms corn and soybeans on about 600 acres in north-central Iowa, said he pays less than $10,000 a year in interest on a line of credit between $100,000 and $200,000. That loan helps him bridge gaps between his expenses and his income, between when he needs to buy seed and fertilizer and when he sells his crops.\u201c[Losing the ability to deduct interest] wouldn\u2019t put me in the red by any stretch of the imagination, but it makes it very debilitating as far as household income,\u201d said Mr. Hill, who added that he has reached out to both of his senators and his House member about the issue.Midsize businesses\u00a0may also get squeezed.\u201cThe people that utilize debt, they utilize it because they don\u2019t have the cash and they don\u2019t have the access to equity,\u201d said Robert Moskovitz, chief financial officer of Leaf Commercial Capital, which finances businesses\u2019 purchases of items like copiers and telephone systems. \u201cA dry cleaner in Des Moines, Iowa? Where is he going to get equity? He can\u2019t do an IPO.\u201dThe idea behind the Republican plan is to pair the elimination of this deduction with immediate deductions for investments in equipment and other long-lived assets. Party leaders expect the capital write-offs\u00a0would encourage more investment and growth and greater worker productivity, but not the debt often associated with it.From an accounting standpoint, the tradeoff could hurt companies\u2019 reported earnings because immediate expensing would just shift the timing of deductions and the loss of the interest deduction would be a permanent change.Dennis Kelleher,        chief financial officer of             CF Industries Holdings Inc.,       a fertilizer manufacturer, said at a conference in May that the most important thing for the company would be a lower corporate tax rate.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said of repealing the interest deduction. \u201cI suspect that won\u2019t happen because it would be rather destabilizing, just to the capital markets generally.\u201dUnlike border adjustment, the idea of accelerating investment write-offs has broad support from conservative groups, such as the National Taxpayers Union, and some support from Democrats, including Jason Furman, who was President Barack Obama\u2019s chief economist. It was a move in the opposite direction, toward longer depreciation schedules, that helped doom a Republican tax plan in 2014.The tax code treats equity financing more harshly than debt. While interest is deductible, dividend payments typically aren\u2019t. Corporate profits can thus be subject to two layers of tax\u2014once at the business level and then when they go to shareholders in the form of dividends.That means the effective marginal tax rate on equity-financed corporate investments is 34.5%, according to a report released by the Treasury Department this year in the waning days of the Obama administration. The corresponding rate for debt-financed investment is negative 5%. That subsidy for corporate debt \u201cpotentially creates a large tax-induced distortion in business decision making,\u201d the report says.But borrowing and deducting interest are deeply ingrained in American corporate\u00a0finance as a normal cost of doing business. Dislodging the traditional practice will be challenging. Some firms might look to borrow offshore instead to reap tax benefits elsewhere.\u201cI don\u2019t even think people think about it much,\u201d said MIT\u2019s Mr. Pozen. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that they\u2019re going to finance it by debt if they have a big acquisition or a big project.\u201dBecause so much is at stake for so many sectors, writing the law could get messy.\u00a0Mr. Brady said small businesses and utilities could get exceptions or specialized rules, as could debt-financed purchases of land, which wouldn\u2019t be\u00a0eligible for immediate investment write-offs.The administration, including a president who has proclaimed himself the \u201cking of debt,\u201d has been wary of repealing the interest deduction but hasn\u2019t drawn a hard line, according to multiple statements. Treasury secretary       Steven Mnuchin       has said his preference is to keep it. Resistance could build among Republicans in Congress and among real-estate firms and the agriculture\u00a0industry, which have formed a coalition to fight the proposal.\u00a0Yet financial markets so far have registered little reaction to the prospect of the interest deduction going away. One reason: The tax change most likely would apply to new loans only.Junk-rated bonds, issued by companies that typically carry a large amount of debt, have returned 4.6% this year\u2014better than the 4.3% returns of investment-grade bonds, according to Bloomberg Barclays data.Without repealing the interest deduction, Republicans\u2019 hopes of providing full and immediate deductions for capital investment are dim. They probably wouldn\u2019t have enough money to offset the upfront fiscal cost of accelerating those deductions.The plus for the GOP is that this issue is more familiar and less black-and-white than the complex border adjustment plan. Limits on interest and accelerated write-offs could be dialed to a politically comfortable spot. If Republicans can\u2019t stomach full repeal of the interest deduction and immediate write-offs, they could try something short of that with, say, half of capital expenses being deductible and half of interest being deductible.Andrea Auerbach, head of global private investment research at Cambridge Associates, which advises institutions that invest in private equity, said the industry would survive a tax overhaul that removes the interest deduction.\u201cThe effects will reverberate for sure,\u201d especially among larger firms that rely more on debt, she said. \u201cBut debt is still going to be cheaper than equity, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going away.\u201d\u2014Sam Goldfarb contributed to this article.Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'A $1.5 Trillion Tax Change Flies Under the Radar.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 20:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-1-5-trillion-business-tax-change-flying-under-the-radar-1498388402", "news_title": "The $1.5 Trillion Business Tax Change Flying Under the Radar ", "keywords": "border adjustment,gop tax overhaul,gop tax plan,interest deduction,net interest deduction,pe industry news,tax plan,tax reform,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,corporate taxation,government finance,government budget,taxation,direct taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,agriculture"}, {"content": "Billionaire activist investor       Daniel Loeb\u2019s       Third Point LLC hedge fund has taken its largest-ever initial bet on a public company, with a $3.5 billion stake in         Nestl\u00e9 SA,       piling pressure on the world\u2019s largest packaged-foods company to find ways to accelerate growth.The stake amounts to about 1.25% of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s shares. That\u2019s a small investment for the European giant. But it\u2019s an unusually big bet for a U.S. activist fund in Europe, where American investors\u2019 sometimes aggressive approach has had mixed success.Nestl\u00e9 didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Third Point outlined an array of changes it believes the consumer-goods giant could make, including improving margins, innovating in its core business and selling noncore assets and its 23% stake in French cosmetics company         L\u2019Or\u00e9al SA      .\u201cIt is rare to find a business of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s quality with so many avenues for improvement,\u201d Third Point said in a letter to investors on Sunday night.\u201cDespite having arguably the best positioned portfolio in the consumer packaged goods industry, Nestl\u00e9 shares have significantly underperformed most of their U.S. and European consumer staples peers on a three year, five year, and ten year total shareholder return basis,\u201d it said.Third Point said Nestl\u00e9 has \u201cfallen behind over the past decade,\u201d and that while competitors have adapted to changes in how people shop and to more competition from small, local brands, \u201cNestl\u00e9 has remained stuck in its old ways.\u201dThe stake is Third Point\u2019s largest initial bet in its more than 20-year history and ranks among the largest in activism history as well.Mr. Loeb played a big role in shaking up         Yahoo Inc.       as an activist shareholder and board member some years ago. He is also known for fiery-worded letters to executives and fights at companies like Sotheby\u2019s, though in recent years he has tamed his public image and looked to work more quietly with companies. A recent call to split up conglomerate         Honeywell International Inc.,       for instance, found a somewhat open ear at the company, which has said it is already entertaining his idea even if it hasn\u2019t committed to a plan.Mr. Loeb has been among the few U.S.-based activists to venture abroad for some of his biggest investments, where rules of the game are different and there\u2019s less of a record of shareholder support for more aggressive campaigns. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp., for instance, was unsuccessful in its recent efforts to coerce         Akzo Nobel               NV, in which it has shares, into unwanted sale talks with         PPG Industries Inc.Nestl\u00e9 in February said it was dropping a long-running sales-growth target after missing that goal for the fourth straight year. The company\u2019s new chief executive, Mark Schneider, a health-care veteran, recently said Nestl\u00e9 would look to sell its U.S. confectionery business, which lags behind rivals         Hershey Co.      , Mars Inc. and         Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Spruengli AG      .Nestl\u00e9 has also faced calls to consider selling its frozen-food arm, which includes brands like Lean Cuisine and Stouffer\u2019s, another business that has struggled as consumers increasingly look to fresh options.Mr. Schneider has been working to better understand changing consumer behavior and raise Nestl\u00e9\u2019s exposure to higher-growth channels. Last week the company disclosed a stake in subscription-meals delivery firm Freshly\u2014which sells healthy, prepared meals to U.S. consumers\u2014saying it would benefit from its analytics and distribution.Third Point said Nestl\u00e9\u2019s stagnant per-share earnings over the past five years have translated to slowing dividend growth.\u201cWithout addressing the company\u2019s stalled earnings, further dividend increases will be unsustainable at historical rates,\u201d said the firm. \u201cWhile Nestl\u00e9 has stood still, its peers have pursued productivity increases aggressively and made other changes in order to deliver earnings growth and create shareholder value in a slower sales growth world.\u201dNestl\u00e9 isn\u2019t the only consumer-goods company to struggle with slowing growth. Rivals including Unilever PLC,         Danone SA       and Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC have all grappled with weaker global growth\u2014particularly in emerging markets\u2014volatile currencies, changing consumer tastes and a difficulty raising prices in an environment of low inflation or even falling prices, known as deflation.Other consumer-goods companies like Unilever, Diageo PLC and         Kraft Heinz Co.       have taken a hard line on cost by adopting so-called zero based budgeting, whereby expenses have to be justified from scratch every year. But Nestl\u00e9 has criticized the cost-cutting approach pioneered by Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital Partners LP, with Mr. Schneider on Thursday saying at a conference \u201cwe don\u2019t believe in that model.\u201d The company follows its own cost-cutting program, while simultaneously investing in what it says are high-growth areas of its business such as petfood and coffee.Mr. Loeb said he thinks Nestl\u00e9 can improve its margins by as much as 4 percentage points over the next several years and that the company should adopt a formal margin target of 18%-20% by 2020. He added that the company should take on more debt to fund share buybacks and sell its stake in L\u2019Or\u00e9al, which currently makes up 10% of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s market capitalization with a value of over $25 billion, allowing shareholders to choose whether they want to invest just in Nestl\u00e9 or also in L\u2019Or\u00e9al.Mr. Loeb drew comparisons with Third Point\u2019s 2015 investment in         Baxter International Inc.,       which led the Deerfield, Ill.-based hospital-products maker to give his firm a seat on the board and a role in the hunt for the company\u2019s next chief executive.He described Nestl\u00e9\u2019s condition as similar to Baxter\u2019s saying investors there had underestimated the potential possibilities with a new CEO focused on things like better capital allocation, portfolio optimization and margin improvement.While Mr. Loeb has taken a forceful approach with other companies, he indicated he will be collaborative with Nestl\u00e9, saying he \u201cintends to play a constructive role to encourage management to pursue change with a greater sense of urgency.\u201dHe praised Mr. Schneider, who earned a reputation while CEO of German medical supply company         Fresenius SE,       for driving strong growth. But he said Mr. Schneider would have to address what he called the \u201cstaid culture and tendency towards incrementalism that has typified the company\u2019s prior leadership and resulted in its long-term underperformance.\u201dNestl\u00e9\u2019s shares have climbed recently as investors have high hopes for Mr. Schneider. Fresenius shares rose 1,246% during his CEO tenure. He is credited with boosting revenue at the German firm through geographic expansion and a number of big acquisitions.Nestl\u00e8\u2019s shares were recently up 3.6% after climbing to a high of over 4% in early European trading.Third Point is working alongside       Jan Bennink,        the former CEO of Royal Numico NV, to help formulate its plan for Nestl\u00e9, saying Mr. Bennink\u2019s move to cut costs and sell noncore assets while at the baby-food company had dramatically increased sales and expanded margins before it was sold to Danone. Mr. Bennink\u2014who has himself taken shares in Nestl\u00e9\u2014also previously worked as the executive chairman of Sara Lee Corp., overseeing its split into two companies.\u2014David Benoit in New York contributed to this article.Write to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Activist Targets Nestl\u00e9.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 20:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dan-loebs-activist-hedge-fund-third-point-takes-3-5-billion-stake-in-nestle-1498427619", "news_title": "Daniel Loeb\u2019s Activist Hedge Fund Third Point Takes $3.5 Billion Stake in Nestl\u00e9 ", "keywords": " activist investor, daniel loeb,nestle, stake, third point,Nestle,NESN.EB,NESN.VX,L'Oreal,OR.FR,LRLCY,Third Point,Daniel Loeb,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,management,corporate actions,shareholder activism,corporate,industrial news,corporate governance,cosmetics,toiletries,food,beverages,tobacco,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,consumer goods,financial services,food products,hedge funds,investing,securities,personal care products,appliances"}, {"content": "If you hate robocalls, brace yourself: Sen.

The network is also throwing its full support behind nascent efforts on Capitol Hill to overhaul the nation\u2019s tax code for the first time in more than 30 years.Officials with the network anticipate the 2018 election cycle budget would be the \u201clargest we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d The Kochs\u2019 large donor network\u2014which typically attracts conservatives with a libertarian bent interested in issues like reduced regulation and smaller government\u2014sketched out an ambitious agenda that would see the network involved in politics, education, community activism and business.In addition to the group\u2019s well-known political work, leaders detailed initiatives that the network was funding or working on aimed at combating homelessness, poverty, prison re-entry and lack of educational opportunities at the community level. Mr. Koch also announced a partnership with Hall of Fame football player Deion Sanders to work on anti-poverty initiatives in Dallas.The event\u2019s organizers allowed more than a dozen reporters from national and local outlets to attend the closed seminar on condition they not identify the donors at the event without their consent. The Wall Street Journal agreed to the arrangement.Charles Koch, along with his brother David, have emerged as major power players in Republican politics, donating and raising millions for conservative candidates and causes typically raised and spent through a network of nonprofit organizations. The two men made their fortune in the energy sector, running the privately held company Koch Industries.The two donors have also had a rocky relationship with President       Donald Trump.       They were publicly critical of him during the 2016 election, and their donor network largely stayed on the sidelines of the general election campaign between Mr. Trump and his Democratic rival       Hillary Clinton.But there are also signs that Kochs and the Trump administration are prepared to work together on some issues. Vice President       Mike Pence       met with Charles Koch and other network officials on Friday. Mr. Pence was in Colorado Springs for a fundraising held at the same resort.Network officials described the discussion between the vice president and Koch officials as \u201ccordial,\u201d adding that it touched on substantive issues, including the health-care bill that is being considered by the Senate.VIEW InteractiveBeyond health-care, the network identified several major areas of cooperation with the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress, including federal court appointments, a tax overhaul, reducing regulations, issues around school choice and veteran\u2019s affairs.A major area of disagreement with the Trump administration comes in the criminal justice space, where Mr. Trump\u2019s Justice Department has been pushing tougher sentencing laws and a crackdown on marijuana. The Kochs have been pushing for an overhaul of sentencing, especially for nonviolent offenders.On the new sentencing rules announced by the administration,       Mark Holden,        a top network official, said that the groups \u201crespectfully disagree\u201d with the decision by the Justice Department.The weekend gathering at the historic Broadmoor hotel and resort in Colorado Springs drew a number of well-known Republican elected officials, including Texas Gov.       Greg Abbott,        Kentucky Gov.       Matt Bevin,        Texas senators       Ted Cruz       and       John Cornyn,       Ben Sasse       of Nebraska and Utah\u2019s       Mike Lee,        among others.One of the key topics of discussion at the event was the Senate\u2019s health-care bill, which GOP leaders are hoping to vote on this week before Congress recesses for the Independence Day holiday. The bill aims to roll back large parts of the Affordable Care Act, including a large cut to the Medicaid program that was expanded under the 2010 law.Many conservatives, however, have said the cuts don't go far enough.Network officials expressed some disappointment with the Senate bill but said they expected it would be improved as it moved through the legislative process.\u201cWe\u2019ve been disappointed that movement has not been more dramatic toward a full repeal,\u201d said       Tim Phillips,        president of Americans for Prosperity, part of the Koch-funded network of nonprofits that focuses on grass roots engagement.\u201cIt has to get better,\u201d Mr. Phillips said about the Senate proposal.Sen. Cornyn, a member of Republican leadership, said that the Senate was still expected to vote on the health-care bill Wednesday despite the fact that five members said they opposed the measure as currently written.

The back-to-backlaunches went off without a hitch, with all engines and navigation equipment performing as expected and the SpaceX team, for the first time, smoothly juggling the demands of coordinating blastoffs and recoveries from opposite coasts of the U.S. on such a compressed timetable.After using previously flown main engines to blast a Bulgarian telecommunications satellite into orbit Friday from a Florida launchpad, the closely held company on Sunday afternoon used a California Air Force base to send a batch of 10 smaller satellites into space for             Iridium Communications Inc.,        IRDM 0.93%       SpaceX\u2019s largest commercial customer.Sunday\u2019s blastoff marked the shortest time between launches in SpaceX\u2019s history. As the ninth launch of 2017, it also was a record for annual launches by the company, officially called Space Exploration Technologies Corp. SpaceX had eight successful launches in 2016, before an explosion during routine ground testing temporarily halted Falcon 9 launches.SpaceX has rebounded strongly since that accident, alleviating many of the reliability concerns expressed privately by government and industry officials.But perhaps more than any previous benchmark, this weekend\u2019s activities provided the strongest sign yet that SpaceX is on track to overcome years of nagging schedule slips by continuing to ramp up its launch tempo. Amid cheers from company officials at SpaceX\u2019s mission control center in suburban Los Angeles, Sunday\u2019s blastoff paved the way for gradual deployment of the Iridium satellites over a 15-minute stretch that resembled an automated but graceful ballet in space.Seven minutes after blastoff, the floating platform in the Pacific Ocean started receiving signals from the used booster streaking back toward the landing area. Video cameras captured the soft touchdown.With an aggressive summer and fall launch schedule, SpaceX officials are looking to rack up a total of roughly two dozen launches by the end of the year. Previous internal projections showed as many as 27 launches for all of 2017, nearly doubling to a total of 52 in 2019.But the financial results of flying used boosters remain uncertain. Mr. Musk and some of his top lieutenants initially projected huge price cuts. Then SpaceX officials talked about price reductions of slightly more than one-tenth of the $62 million official Falcon 9 launch price tag. Internal financial documents prepared more than a year ago projected that the combination of reduced prices and refurbishment costs would trim the company\u2019s net income by roughly 20% between 2016 and 2020.More recently, discussions about how SpaceX adjusts its launch schedule priorities\u2014and how customers move up or down that list\u2014has reverberated among rivals and industry officials tracking the company\u2019s prices and activities. Some of these officials have said that willingness or desire to fly satellites on refurbished boosters sometimes can help certain customers speed up dates for blastoff. But other factors in determining launch schedules include contract-price details, which in some cases provide an incentive for SpaceX itself to accelerate launch dates, according to one person familiar with the details. That is because certain launch agreements require the company to provide a discount if launches end up delayed past a specified date, regardless of the type of booster.Juggling launch dates, which happens to a lesser extent with every rocket operator, is further complicated for SpaceX because it has to match customer technical needs with a range of rocket variants the company flies to orbit. And some commercial customers already have been frustrated by having to wait an extra year or two, sometimes even longer, for a ride to space.A SpaceX spokesman on Sunday said, \u201cWe determine when we launch our customers based on the dates included in their respective contracts and the availability of launch vehicles suited to their specific mission requirements.\u201d Spokesman John Taylor also said \u201cit\u2019s important to note that government customers will take priority in the manifest as required by contracts.\u201dMatt Desch,        Iridium\u2019s CEO, has made no secret of his willingness to accept refurbished boosters if that would speed up deployment of his 70-plus satellite constellation, which is currently expected to be completed by mid-2018. Mr. Desch also told reporters on a recent conference call that further price cuts could help persuade him to switch to reused hardware, according to trade publication Space News.The company has said it is working through some 70 missions on its launch backlog with a value in excess of $10 billion. Eventually, SpaceX hopes to transition used boosters for another launch in roughly a day.Sunday\u2019s mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base, on the central California coast, comes at a particularly hectic time for SpaceX. After years of delays, the company plans to launch its significantly beefed-up derivative rocket, called the Falcon Heavy, for the first time later this year. The demonstration flight will be closely watched by both the Pentagon and satellite operators, prospective customers eager to benefit from the Falcon Heavy\u2019s greater power versus the Falcon 9.In addition, SpaceX teams are working toward the initial test flight of a manned capsule, intended to routinely start transporting U.S. astronauts to the international space station by the end of the decade.Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'SpaceX Completes Launch Milestone.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 17:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/spacex-seeks-to-execute-back-to-back-launches-in-roughly-48-hours-1498400829", "news_title": "SpaceX Executes Back-to-Back Launches in Roughly 48 Hours ", "keywords": " boosters, elon musk, falcon 9,launch schedule,refurbished boosters, rocket launches, space exploration technologies,spacex,vc industry news,Iridium Communications,IRDM,Space Exploration Technologies,Elon Musk,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,sciences,humanities,space exploration,travel,aerospace products,parts,space vehicles,space transport,telecommunication services,wireless telecommunications services,satellite telecommunications,aerospace,defense,industrial goods,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "BERMUDA\u2014Emirates Team New Zealand won a pair of America\u2019s Cup races on Sunday to move within a single victory of capturing sailing\u2019s flagship trophy from       Larry Ellison\u2019s            Oracle                   Team USA.Racing in shifty breezes off Bermuda in front of a fleet of hundreds of spectator boats, the Kiwis were faster off the starting line in both races, leaping ahead on the early legs and maintaining comfortable leads around the course.New Zealand was aided along the way by a series of mistakes from the U.S. team, which stalled before one start, incurred a penalty for sailing outside the course boundary and executed some maneuvers poorly during both heats. New Zealand can capture the nearly 166-year-old \u201cAuld Mug\u201d with one victory in races scheduled for Monday, while the U.S. needs to win six straight.The twin victories for the Kiwis came after Oracle won its first race of the regatta Saturday, avoiding a sweep and raising hopes for a U.S. comeback after New Zealand started the event with four consecutive wins.\u201cWe showed today that we\u2019re a pretty tough bunch,\u201d said Peter Burling, helmsman for New Zealand. \u201cWe got asked some questions yesterday and I feel like we answered them with our performance on the water.\u201dThe U.S. can look to recent history for some hope of a rebound. Oracle also stood one race from elimination during the last Cup off San Francisco in 2013 before winning eight in a row to seize the trophy in one of the greatest comebacks in sports.Some sailors and analysts said that sort of recovery remains a longshot, with both boats moving at roughly equivalent speeds and the Kiwis sailing nearly perfect heats.A victory would return the trophy to New Zealand, a country that prides itself on sailing prowess and has been a perpetual Cup contender in recent decades, but which hasn\u2019t won the regatta since 2000. Kiwi fans on the water and on shore cheered Sunday\u2019s victories, honking boat horns and waving flags in celebration.Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill said the team would focus on one race at a time and he was prepared to try anything in coming heats, including benching himself.\u201cClearly, the plan wasn\u2019t to be in this position again, let me tell you, but we\u2019re here, so now it\u2019s up to us to respond and react,\u201d he said.", "news_time": "2017-06-25 17:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/team-new-zealand-is-on-the-edge-of-glory-1498425323", "news_title": "Team New Zealand Is on the Edge of Glory", "keywords": "emirates team new zealand,new zealand,oracle,oracle team usa,team new zealand,aquatics,water sports,sports,recreation,yachting,routine general news"}, {"content": "Liberal opposition to missile defense has persisted since the 1980s, but the politics may be changing with technological progress and the rising threat from North Korean dictator       Kim Jong Un\u2019s       nuclear weapons. Congress has an opportunity this summer to notch a rare bipartisan deal that enhances U.S. security.Kim has already overseen more nuclear and missile tests than his father and grandfather combined, and the Defense Intelligence Agency warns that \u201cif left on its current trajectory\u201d Pyongyang will develop a capacity to hit Japan, Alaska, Hawaii or even the U.S. West Coast. The Trump Administration is pleading with China to stop the North, but Chinese leaders never seem to act and they\u2019re even trying to block regional missile defenses in South Korea.Meanwhile, the U.S. last month successfully tracked and shot down a mock intercontinental ballistic missile, akin to a bullet hitting a bullet. The Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD)\u2014first fielded in 2004 but untested since 2014\u2014has a success rate of nine in 17 intercept trials. But even the failures show the GMD is increasingly effective.Alaska Senator       Dan Sullivan       wants to build on this progress with an amendment that would fund a more integrated system, add new interceptors and sensors and increase research. The legislation has united conservatives such as       Ted Cruz       and       Marco Rubio       and liberal Democrats such as       Gary Peters       and       Brian Schatz,        no small feat in the Trump era.Systems like the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense at sea and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) on the ground can shoot down regional threats within earth\u2019s atmosphere. Only the GMD can hit long-range threats targeting all 50 states, bringing the missiles down in space. All of these systems have separate radars, which have to be coordinated to get a complete picture of a target. The bill aims to create a better integrated system that provides what Mr. Sullivan calls \u201can unblinking eye.\u201dThis would include advanced space-based sensors. An improved system in space could provide a persistent picture\u2014from launch to interception. If the systems can communicate more efficiently, military brass can make better choices faster.By the end of 2017 there will be 40 ground-based interceptors at Alaska\u2019s Fort Greely and four at California\u2019s Vandenberg Air Force Base, where the May test was conducted. The bill provides for 28 more interceptors for Fort Greely. Extra interceptors mean more tests and more available to take out threats. This is crucial as the North builds mobile launchers and tries to develop multiple warheads on a single missile.Some Senators suspect that the Sullivan amendment is little more than home-state pork, but all states would benefit from preventing an attack and the fact of geography is that the trajectory of intercontinental missiles usually requires them to fly over Alaska. The Pentagon is studying whether to place another interceptor site in the Midwest or East Coast.Opponents say missile defenses are too expensive given that interception might fail, so better to trust arms control and the deterrence of mutual-assured destruction. But arms talks with North Korea have been a fool\u2019s errand since negotiator       Robert Gallucci       and       Bill Clinton       bought its promises in 1994.Even a 50% chance of interception might increase deterrence by making the success of an enemy first strike more doubtful. North Koreans or other rogues also may not be rational actors who fear their own annihilation. U.S. leaders have a moral obligation to do more than let Kim Jong Un hold American cities hostage, and without defenses a pre-emptive military strike might be the only alternative.The price for the space-based system is classified but no doubt expensive, and it\u2019s difficult to score technologies still under development. But Congress ought to be able to find money to save Seattle from annihilation while arming U.S. troops against conventional threats. If it can\u2019t, voters should at least be able to see who voted against their protection.The Senate will take up the National Defense Authorization Act in the coming weeks.

Behold how Nevada\u2019s net-metering solar subsidy has risen after a two-year eclipse.Nevada Gov.       Brian Sandoval       recently signed legislation restoring net metering, which compensates electricity customers at the retail rate for the excess solar power that they generate and remit to the grid. The Nevada Public Utilities Commission killed the subsidy in December 2015 because it unfairly shifted costs to lower-income customers without rooftop solar panels.The retail electricity rate includes the cost of transmission, delivery or grid maintenance. Under net metering, solar customers get paid about twice as much for their power than power plants, which are compensated at the wholesale rate, even though their excess generation often isn\u2019t needed and can make it harder to manage the grid. As more people adopt solar, other electric customers will have to shoulder higher costs for operating the grid.More than consumers, solar rooftop-leasing companies like             Sunrun,       Vivint and Tesla are the primary beneficiaries of net metering. These companies install solar panels for free and pocket all of the subsidies, including the 30% federal renewable-investment tax credit. Customers sign contracts agreeing to make payments that will supposedly escalate over time at less than the retail cost of electricity. But they may be getting a raw deal since residential electricity prices have been falling due to lower fuel costs. Over the past two years Nevada\u2019s electricity rates have dropped 12%.Mr. Sandoval at the time supported the utilities commission\u2019s decision to end net metering and instead pay solar customers the wholesale rate for their power. But solar-leasing companies subsequently fled the state because their business was no longer profitable. They claimed thousands of jobs were lost as a result, though many workers who installed panels were free-lancers and have been able to find other work in construction.Nevada\u2019s green-energy ambitions haven\u2019t suffered. In the past year solar generation in Nevada has increased by 71%\u2014more than in Arizona, California and Hawaii\u2014due to expanding solar farms, which are more economical than rooftop panels. Yet Mr. Sandoval says that restoring net metering would ensure that rooftop solar owners get fairly credited for their green energy.Solar customers will now be compensated at 95% of the retail rate and be protected from future regulatory changes. You\u2019d think the green lobby would be thanking the sun gods, but they\u2019re still raging at the Governor for vetoing an increase in the state\u2019s renewables mandate to 40% of electric-power generation by 2030 from 25% in 2025.The solar lobby and its media friends keep telling us how sun power is taking over the world, but we\u2019ll believe it when it can compete without subsidies that fleece consumers.", "news_time": "2017-06-25 17:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nevadas-solar-subsidy-resurrection-1498424995", "news_title": "Nevada\u2019s Solar Subsidy Resurrection", "keywords": " brian sandoval,nevada,solar energy, subsidies, sunrun, tesla, vivent,Nevada Public Utilities Commission,regulation,government policy,government aid,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,editorials,energy,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,renewable energy generation,electric utilities,utilities"}, {"content": "Scott Gottlieb,        the new Food and Drug Administration commissioner, is focused on scientific innovation and \u201cfinding better treatments for a lot of costly diseases.\u201d In Senate testimony last week, he talked about facilitating approval of targeted genetic cancer therapies and medications for rare diseases, known as orphan drugs. To streamline the discovery process and avoid duplication, Dr. Gottlieb has told me, the FDA will emphasize the need to \u201cbetter integrate academic discoveries with industry.\u201dThat won\u2019t be easy\u2014academia, government researchers and industry have long been rivals. But Dr. Gottlieb can shed light on the positive accomplishments of industry scientists while encouraging more open communication among the three groups and reducing redundancy.Most Americans are unaware how many great scientists, trained in academia, now work in private pharmaceutical laboratories. A 2010 paper in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery confirmed that the vast majority of pharmaceuticals now in use were discovered in drug-company labs, where a process known as high-throughput screening allows computer analysis of thousands of compounds to determine those with the best activity against certain diseases. Big Pharma pioneered this process in the late 1980s before its use began to expand to academia in the early 2000s.Once a promising drug has been discovered, it moves first to animal testing and then to human clinical trials. It is here that the corporate and academic worlds must work together. For decades, research funded by pharmaceutical companies has exceeded what the National Institutes of Health spends. According to a 2010 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, of the approximately $100 billion spent in biomedical research in 2007, close to 60% came from the pharmaceutical industry and a little more than 30% from the government. In 2011, the industry spent $39 billion on research in the U.S. while the NIH spent $31 billion. Drug-company-funded clinical trials at major medical centers produce the majority of publications in the medical literature.A laboratory scientist has many incentives to leave academia and come over to the \u201cdark side\u201d of private industry. The money is better, of course, but the profit motive in well-equipped private labs often leads to an emphasis on creative solutions. One downside: the loss of prestige that goes along with an academic affiliation.A few years ago I visited Pfizer Laboratories in Groton, Conn., to meet with a chemist (trained at a top university) who had discovered a novel use for the antibiotic azithromycin. He told me he was about to abandon his research because the drug seemed ineffective. Following an impulse, he measured tissue levels of azithromycin, which stayed elevated for several days. He realized a patient could take a five-day course of the drug and it would remain effective much longer. The popular and effective Zithromax Z-Pak was born. \u201cI would never have felt the freedom to go the extra step in my previous life in academia,\u201d he said.Collaboration between academia and industry has helped along several new Ebola vaccines in development at the NIH, including VSV-Zebov. Discovered by Canadian scientists and licensed by New Link Genetics and Merck, VSV-Zebov was studied in a clinical trial in Guinea. The results, published in the journal Lancet in December, look promising.Even             Microsoft                   is entering the world of academic medicine. The technology giant has developed a prototype of a watch it calls Emma that senses and temporarily quiets tremors caused by Parkinson\u2019s disease. If trials confirm the watch\u2019s promise, Emma could help diagnose patients and treat symptoms without the side effects of common Parkinson\u2019s medications.The process of developing a new vaccine or bringing a new device to market is complex and exacting. Manufacturers are generally motivated by profit, and their top scientists operate with a creativity rare among the protocol-heavy, prestige-driven scientists of academia. But both sides share a goal: curing people.

The bombing marks the return of urban terrorism to Colombia\u2019s capital city even while the ink is barely dry on the \u201cpeace\u201d settlement President       Juan Manuel Santos       signed in Havana last year with the narcoterrorist group FARC.Mr. Santos immediately declared the perpetrators of the crime \u201cenemies of peace.\u201d Thank you, Captain Obvious. But Colombians are asking who did it, and the answers they\u2019re getting are suspiciously murky.That has given rise to rumors of a cover-up. Yet one thing is certain: Granting impunity for crimes against humanity, as Mr. Santos did for the FARC, has invited more terrorism.Centro Andino is a national symbol of capitalism and has long been considered a possible terror target. Vehicles entering the parking garage are inspected by police and bomb-sniffing dogs. The areas in and around the mall are blanketed with surveillance cameras. Colombian forensic teams excel at terrorism investigations and count on U.S. technical support for anything they lack. Yet this investigation appears amateurish at best.Investigators initially said witnesses spotted two suspicious males entering the ladies\u2019 room not long before the bomb went off. Normally video footage would be urgently released to enlist the public in finding the suspects.Instead the investigation team recruited sketch artists to make composite drawings of the men. The             Twitter                   handle @Oskar_Sc captured the ridiculousness of this: \u201cIf you spit a piece of chewing gum\u201d in Andino, \u201csecurity can show the image from four different angles. They make a composite sketch of the attack?\u201dThe sketches were released Tuesday. A day later the government withdrew them and said they weren\u2019t official.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but that\u2019s not unusual. After the FARC bombed Club El Nogal in 2003 it denied paternity until authorities uncovered documents five years later that proved its guilt for a massacre that killed 36.The only one to die instantly in the Andino blast was a 23-year-old French national,       Julie Huynh.       She had been in Colombia for six months doing social work for a nongovernmental organization with links to former FARC guerrillas ostensibly demobilized under the Santos agreement. On June 8 she reportedly took a trip to Cuba. She was at the mall with her mother and planned to leave Colombia within days.Counterterrorism 101 teaches that in any terrorist attack, those closest to the explosion are prime suspects until they can be cleared. Huynh had to have been near the bomb; the other two women died from their wounds at the hospital. Yet the investigation has produced nothing substantive about any of the victims.Investigators have said the bomb used ammonia nitrate, a notoriously unstable compound. Whoever took it into a closed area like a bathroom probably was not an explosives expert.On Wednesday the Colombian news outlet RCN reported in vague terms that the medical examiner found no traces of bomb residue on any of the bodies, a claim that is not credible. When asked, the medical examiner wouldn\u2019t confirm that claim, saying only that he made a report to the attorney general\u2019s office. No one answered that office\u2019s public-affairs lines when I called on Friday, and no report has been made public.The FARC\u2019s reaction to Huynh\u2019s death has been intriguing. It has oozed sympathy on social media for her but has not mentioned the other victims. A photo of her posted by the FARC contains its seal in the lower left corner. Perhaps unfairly, Colombians are recalling the story of       Tanja Nijmeijer,        the Dutch national who arrived in Colombia in 2000 under a \u201csocial worker\u201d cover and turned out to be a ruthless terrorist.On Wednesday the police announced arrest warrants for five men and one woman who it said are members of People\u2019s Revolutionary Movement (MRP), an offshoot of the Marxist National Liberation Army (ELN). On Saturday it said it arrested four men and four women alleged to be MRP members involved in the crime. Some were reportedly captured in a town known as a FARC stronghold. It is worth noting that MRP bombings until now have been low-power, nonlethal events in which pamphlets were left behind\u2014very different than Andino.Huynh\u2019s proximity to the bomb may have been pure coincidence. But the failure to conduct a professional investigation muddies the waters.Mr. Santos warned Colombians last year that if the FARC isn\u2019t appeased, it will return to urban warfare. Recently the attorney general said that the FARC\u2019s wealth has been uncovered and will be confiscated to compensate its victims. Colombians could be forgiven for fearing that at Centro Andino the FARC responded.Write to O\u2019Grady@wsj.com.", "news_time": "2017-06-25 17:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/urban-terrorism-returns-to-colombia-1498424866", "news_title": "Urban Terrorism Returns to Colombia", "keywords": " bombing, centro andino,colombia, farc, juan manuel santos, peace deal,the FARC,Juan Manuel Santos,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,terrorism,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "When Republican lawmakers came under fire during a June 14 baseball practice in Virginia, they were trapped by a tall fence with one exit. Thanks to armed officers guarding House Majority Whip       Steve Scalise,        only five people were wounded.But although members of the congressional leadership are provided security details, the rest of us have to count on luck. \u201cWhen congressmen and senators are off the Capitol Hill campus, we are still high-profile targets, but we have zero protection,\u201d Rep.       Mo Brooks       of Alabama told       John Lott       of the Crime Prevention Research Center.Mr. Lott, who worked with me on this article, and I have talked to some of the congressmen and staffers who were there during the attack. They uniformly want to change the District of Columbia\u2019s gun-control laws.Rep.       Steve Pearce       of New Mexico described to me how a security officer\u2019s shots put the attacker into a defensive position, causing him to come out from behind a wall to fire before taking cover again. Had the attacker \u201ctaken even six steps forward,\u201d Mr. Pearce said, he would have seen several exposed people concealed from his line of sight.At least five congressmen at the baseball practice have concealed handgun permits in their home states. At least one aide also has a permit. Others may be reluctant to announce publicly that they do, since part of the benefit of carrying a concealed weapon is that potential attackers do not know who is armed. That\u2019s why uniformed police have an almost impossible job stopping terrorist attacks. A uniform is like a neon sign flashing: \u201cI have a gun. Shoot me first.\u201dIn 2015 the Daily Caller surveyed 38 conservative members of Congress, asking whether they held a concealed-carry permit. Thirty declined to answer. Of the eight who did respond, six had permits.       Jerry Henry,        executive director of Georgia Carry, says that as of last year nine of the 10 Republican congressmen from his state had a concealed-carry permit.An aide says that when Rep.       Barry Loudermilk       is speaking at public events in his district, \u201cthey always have someone with the congressman who is carrying.\u201d Likewise, when I\u2019m home in Kentucky, my staff and I carry weapons.But the District of Columbia\u2019s gun regulations meant no one had a permitted, concealed handgun at the congressional baseball practice. Virginia, where the attack occurred, honors permits from any other state. But as Mr. Brooks explained: \u201cMy residence is in the District of Columbia, which means that it would have been illegal for me to take my weapon with me to the ballpark\u2014about a 9-mile bike ride\u2014and it would have also been illegal for me to come from Virginia back into D.C. with my weapon.\u201dBoth Rep. Brooks and the Loudermilk aide say they believe the attack could have been ended much earlier. The aide, who asked to be unnamed, has received active-shooter training and remained behind a car 15 to 20 yards from the attacker. He believes he could have shot the attacker from his position and ended the attack \u201cprobably four minutes earlier.\u201dMr. Brooks believes he was much better-positioned than the two officers guarding Mr. Scalise, who were on the opposite side of the field: \u201cIf I had a weapon in my backpack in the dugout, I would have had an opportunity to stop him.\u201dThat\u2019s why I have introduced legislation to allow people with concealed handgun permits from any state to carry their permitted firearms into the District of Columbia.

Their prosperity required a steady supply of cotton to feed New England\u2019s growing textile industry. Even after slavery ended in 1865, wealthy Bostonians were reluctant to abandon their traditional business.       Henry Lee Higginson,        30 years old and freshly discharged from the Union Army, bought with his partners a 5,000-acre plantation in Georgia with the goal of turning a profit by growing cotton. But the 60 former slaves living on the plantation thought the wages and terms offered to be grossly inadequate; the land they had worked in chains for generations, they believed, should belong to them. The enterprise soon collapsed.As similar episodes played out across the South, Boston\u2019s business elites looked for new places to invest their money. \u201cThey began to reenvision American capitalist development, not in modifying and salvaging the arrangements of earlier decades but in a far more ambitious program of continental industrialization,\u201d       Noam Maggor       writes in \u201cBrahmin Capitalism.\u201d \u201cThey retreated from cotton and moved into a host of groundbreaking ventures in the Great American West\u2014mining, stockyards, and railroads.\u201dThis reinvention, Mr. Maggor argues convincingly, undermines prevailing stereotypes of Boston\u2019s elite in the 19th century. Far from being a conservative, inward-looking sort who settled into soft decline, the Brahmins crisscrossed the continent and took bold risks in search of higher yields than New England\u2019s manufacturing businesses could provide. In the process, they turned Boston into an interconnected financial hub that supplied the capital that the growing West needed for development. They also remade the economy of the United States, turning it from a largely agricultural exporter into the greatest industrial country in the world, out-producing Britain, France and Germany combined.By Noam Maggor  Harvard, 284 pages, $39.95In the hands of       Charles Francis Adams,        a grandson and great-grandson of presidents, Boston capital turned the sleepy Kansas City stockyards into a center of the fast-growing meat industry. Between 1868 and 1883, the investment portfolio of       Thomas Jefferson Coolidge      \u2014great-grandson of the third U.S. president\u2014more than doubled its investment in Western industry, including allocations to stockyards, mining companies and railroads. Among them was the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe, of which Coolidge briefly served as president.Especially representative of the Bostonians\u2019 transformative influence was Higginson\u2019s next enterprise. Far removed from Georgian cotton, his interests landed on a copper mine in northern Michigan\u2019s remote Keweenaw Peninsula. Copper had been discovered there 20 years earlier, but extraction had been small-scale and labor intensive; the high cost per unit meant that mining was profitable only for veins that contained at least 40% copper. In a short time, high-yield mines in the area began to show signs of depletion. But with Higginson\u2019s capital\u2014alongside investments from other Brahmins\u2014large-scale copper extraction could take place as a continuous operation, making mining profitable on belts that contained only 2%-4% copper. In this way, Higginson\u2019s Eastern capital transformed Western mining and launched a career that would make him one of Boston\u2019s leading financiers.\u201cBrahmin Capitalism\u201d is rich with such vignettes, although they are not always integrated into the context and the book suffers somewhat as a piece of storytelling. What Mr. Maggor, a fellow in the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard, has really produced is a work of scholarship; about a fourth of the text consists of research notes.This research is used to present an informative chronicle and to advance a few novel, and often persuasive, hypotheses, among them the notion that America\u2019s Gilded Age isn\u2019t as uniquely American as many would think. The Brahmins plowed establishment money into exploiting the resources of an underdeveloped region to increase their own fortunes; in doing so, they followed the same process as investors around the world who \u201cmobilized to intensify their domination of continental hinterlands and pull vast territories in India, Egypt, Asia, Africa, and Latin America into the world economy.\u201d In Mr. Maggor\u2019s telling, this places the changing American economy of the late 19th century within the more universal story of the transformation of global capitalism.Mr. Maggor also finds evidence that the Brahmin capitalists shaped politics far beyond the borders of Massachusetts. The rush of Eastern capital into the territories made more urgent the need for state governments capable of developing the regulations, rule of law and infrastructure that burgeoning industries required. Western populist voters, for their part, pushed against policies that privileged faraway investors. The tensions between the Brahmins and the settlers, and their ultimate resolution, determined the expanding nation\u2019s laws on everything from water rights to railroad regulations to worker-safety rules.Similar battles were waged in the Brahmins\u2019 backyard, particularly in the debate over whether Boston should annex outlying communities like Dorchester and Roxbury. These annexations were championed by the area\u2019s middle class, who sought to raise taxes on the Brahmins in order to free up land for lower-cost housing and to finance the extension of urban infrastructure into less affluent districts. The Brahmins, meanwhile, opposed such plans, concerned that fiscal recklessness and high taxes would cause capital to flee the city.The Brahmins lost and, as Mr. Maggor writes, Boston was \u201cplunged . . . into ever-growing expenditures and rising property taxation,\u201d which, to the elites, \u201cthreatened the status of the metropolis as an attractive place for business.\u201d Today, Boston has been eclipsed as a financial and economic center not only by New York but also by upstarts like Houston and San Francisco. Perhaps Mr. Maggor\u2019s tale is above all a cautionary one.Mr. Gordon is the author of \u201cAn Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-25 17:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/enterprising-bostonians-1498424780", "news_title": "Enterprising Bostonians", "keywords": "book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "What exactly is Special Counsel Robert       Mueller       investigating? The basis in law\u2014regulation, actually\u2014for Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment is a finding by the deputy attorney general that \u201ccriminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted.\u201dAccording to some reports, the possible crime is obstruction of justice. The relevant criminal statute provides that \u201cwhoever corruptly .\u00a0.\u00a0. influences, obstructs or impedes or endeavors [to do so], the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had,\u201d is guilty of a crime. The key word is \u201ccorruptly.\u201dPresident       Trump\u2019s       critics describe two of his actions as constituting possible obstruction. One is an alleged request to then-FBI Director       James Comey       that he go easy on former national security adviser       Michael Flynn,        who was under investigation for his dealings with Russia and possible false statements to investigators about them. According to Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump told him, \u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,\u201d because \u201che is a good guy.\u201dAn obstruction charge based on that act would face two hurdles. One is that the decision whether to charge Mr. Flynn was not Mr. Comey\u2019s. As FBI director, his job was to supervise the investigation. It is up to prosecutors to decide whether charges were justified. The president\u2019s confusion over the limits of Mr. Comey\u2019s authority may be understandable. Mr. Comey\u2019s overstepping of his authority last year, when he announced that no charges were warranted against       Hillary Clinton,        might have misled Mr. Trump about the actual scope of Mr. Comey\u2019s authority. Nonetheless, the president\u2019s confusion could not have conferred authority on Mr. Comey.The other is the statutory requirement that a president have acted \u201ccorruptly.\u201d In Arthur Andersen LLP v. U.S. (2005), the U.S. Supreme Court accepted the following definition: that the act be done \u201cknowingly and dishonestly, with the specific intent to subvert or undermine the integrity\u201d of a proceeding. Taking a prospective defendant\u2019s character into account when deciding whether to charge him\u2014as Mr. Comey says Mr. Trump asked him to do\u2014is a routine exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is hard to imagine that a properly instructed jury could decide that a single such request constituted acting \u201ccorruptly\u201d\u2014particularly when, according to Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump also told him to pursue evidence of criminality against any of the president\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018satellite\u2019 associates.\u201dThe second act said to carry the seed of obstruction is the firing of Mr. Comey as FBI director. The president certainly had the authority; it is his motive that his critics question. A memorandum to the president, from the deputy attorney general and endorsed by the attorney general, presented sufficient grounds for the firing: Mr. Comey\u2019s usurpation of the prosecutor\u2019s role in the Clinton matter and his improper public disclosure of information unfavorable to Mrs. Clinton. But the president\u2019s detractors have raised questions about the timing\u2014about 3\u00bd months into the president\u2019s term. They have also cited the president\u2019s statement to Russian diplomats days afterward that the firing had eased the pressure on him.The timing itself does not suggest a motive to obstruct. Rather, coming a few days after Mr. Comey refused to confirm publicly what he had told Mr. Trump three times\u2014that the president himself was not the subject of a criminal investigation\u2014the timing suggests no more than an understandable anger. The statement to Russian diplomats, which might have been intended to put the Russians at ease, collides with the simple fact that an investigation\u2014conducted by agents in the field\u2014proceeds regardless of whether the director continues in office, and thus hardly suggests the president acted \u201ccorruptly.\u201dOne of Mr. Mueller\u2019s early hires among the dozen-plus lawyers already aboard has a troubling history with the word \u201ccorruptly.\u201d       Andrew Weissmann       led the Enron prosecution team that pressed an aggressive interpretation of \u201ccorruptly,\u201d which permitted a conviction even absent the kind of guilty knowledge the law normally associates with criminal charges. As a result, the accounting firm Arthur Andersen was convicted. By the time the conviction was reversed on appeal to the Supreme Court in 2005\u2014in large part due to the erroneous application of \u201ccorruptly\u201d in the statute at issue\u2014Arthur Andersen had already ceased operation.What if\u2014for some reason not apparent to the public now\u2014Mr. Mueller were to conclude that the president did act \u201ccorruptly\u201d? Could he initiate a criminal prosecution? The Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department, which sets policy for the department and other agencies of government, has already opined more than once\u2014starting in 1973, during Watergate\u2014that the answer is no. It would offend the Constitution for the executive branch to prosecute its head.What else might Mr. Mueller do? Some have suggested that if he finds criminal activity occurred he could report his findings to the House so as to trigger an impeachment proceeding, as Independent Counsel       Kenneth Starr       did in 1998. But the law under which Mr. Starr was appointed has lapsed, and the regulations governing the special counsel provide for only two kinds of reports\u2014either to Justice Department leadership when some urgent event occurs during the investigation, or to the attorney general to explain the decision to prosecute or not. Reports of either type are to be treated as confidential.Mr. Mueller could simply take the bit in his teeth and write a public report on his own authority, or write a confidential report and leak it to the press. If he did either, he would be following Mr. Comey\u2019s lawless example.Or if, as appears from what we know now, there is no crime here, Mr. Mueller, notwithstanding his more than a dozen lawyers and unlimited budget, could live up to his advance billing for integrity and propriety and resist the urge to grab a headline\u2014not necessarily his own urge but that of some he has hired.Hold fast.

Our people and institutions have steadfastly viewed democratic change as an instrument for renewal and resurgence.In an uncertain global economic landscape, our two nations stand as mutually reinforcing engines of growth and innovation. Confidence in each other\u2019s political values and a strong belief in each other\u2019s prosperity has enabled our engagement to grow. A vision of joint success and progress guides our partnership.Our bilateral trade, which already totals about $115 billion a year, is poised for a multifold increase. Indian companies are adding value to the manufacturing and services sectors in the U.S., with total investments of approximately $15 billion and a presence in more than 35 states, including in the Rust Belt. American companies have likewise fueled their global growth by investing more than $20 billion in India.The transformation of India presents abundant commercial and investment opportunities for American businesses. The rollout of the Goods and Services Tax on July 1 will, in a single stroke, convert India into a unified, continent-sized market of 1.3 billion people. The planned 100 smart cities, the massive modernization of ports, airports, and road and rail networks, and the construction of affordable housing for all by 2022\u2014the 75th anniversary of India\u2019s independence\u2014are not just promises of great urban renewal within India. These plans also showcase the enormous fruits of our relationships with enterprising U.S. partners\u2014worth many billions of dollars over the next decade alone\u2014together with concomitant new employment opportunities across both societies.India\u2019s rapidly expanding aviation needs, and our increasing demand for gas, nuclear, clean coal and renewables, are two significant areas of increasing convergence. In coming years, Indian companies will import energy in excess of $40 billion from the U.S., and more than 200 American-made aircraft will join the private Indian aviation fleet.The combination of technology, innovation and skilled workers has helped forge an exciting digital and scientific partnership between our two countries. The creative and entrepreneurial energy of our engineers, scientists and researchers, and their free movement between both countries, continue to help India and the U.S. retain their innovation edge and maintain competitiveness in the knowledge economy.A new layer in our engagement is our partnership for global good. Whenever India and the U.S. work together, the world reaps the benefits\u2014be it our collaborative efforts to find affordable vaccines for rotavirus or dengue, our joint studies of gravitational waves, observations of distant planets, establishing norms for cyberspace, providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in the Indo-Pacific region, or training peacekeepers in Africa.Defense is another mutually beneficial sphere of our partnership. Both India and the U.S. have an overriding interest in securing our societies, and the world, from the forces of terrorism, radical ideologies and nontraditional security threats. India has four decades\u2019 experience in fighting terrorism, and we share the U.S. administration\u2019s determination to defeat this scourge.We are already working together to address the existing and emerging strategic and security challenges that affect both our nations\u2014in Afghanistan, West Asia, the large maritime space of the Indo-Pacific, the new and unanticipated threats in cyberspace. We also share an interest in ensuring that sea lanes\u2014critical lifelines of trade and energy\u2014remain secure and open to all.The logic of our strategic relationship is incontrovertible. It is further underpinned by faith in the strength of our multicultural societies that have defended our values at all costs, including the supreme sacrifices we\u2019ve made in distant corners of the globe. The three-million-strong Indian-American community, which represents the best of both our countries, has played a crucial role in connecting and contributing to our societies.The past two decades have been a productive journey of engagement for our mutual security and growth.

We write to support two propositions that can better serve economically vulnerable families, while also ensuring that public dollars are spent effectively. First, we believe public subsidies for private insurance premiums should be means-adjusted to make coverage affordable for lower-income people. Second, we believe states should be given new flexibility to streamline coverage options in Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and other publicly supported insurance, so that families can obtain the coverage that best suits their circumstances and serves their needs.We, along with       Sara Rosenbaum,       Gail Wilensky,       Joe Antos,       John McDonough,        Grace-Marie Turner and       Stuart Butler      \u2014a group of health policy researchers who join in this article\u2014hold diverse political views and policy outlooks. But we believe these propositions transcend partisanship and ideology.Most Americans receive employer-sponsored health insurance, which is heavily subsidized through the tax system. Many millions of others are enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP, funded jointly by the federal government and the states, and Medicare, funded through federal tax revenue and individual contributions. Until 2014, individuals who were not eligible for employer-sponsored insurance or public programs could buy their own insurance, but most did not receive any financial help. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, millions more people receive subsidies to help pay for their insurance premiums.Public support for health coverage should be spent as effectively and efficiently as possible. Toward that end, we agree that the existing tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health benefits should have reasonable limits. We also agree that it is prudent to provide subsidies for people who need help to purchase adequate insurance. While hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars reduce the cost of health coverage and care for most Americans, until recently those with limited financial means seeking individual coverage were left out. This lack of access to affordable care drove many uninsured Americans to skip medical treatment that would have averted suffering and higher costs over time.If we expect low-income families to purchase health insurance, we must structure the subsidies to make affordable coverage a realistic possibility. That means providing greater subsidies to those who can least afford the premiums.While we have differing perspectives about the level and structure of Medicaid funding, we all believe that carefully developed state testing can be a primary engine for reforming Medicaid and providing care to low-income families. The improved use of waivers, for example, can help states develop fiscally sound and affordable coverage options for their most vulnerable citizens.States should be given greater authority to configure and redirect revenue streams from Medicaid, CHIP and private insurance to improve and strengthen coverage. Integration of funding streams would make it easier for individuals to keep the same coverage and providers when their employment or other life circumstances change. It would also allow all family members to share the same health plan. Experimentation would enable states to integrate health-care options better so that families could choose the best plan for their needs.To ensure cost-effectiveness, states seeking waivers should be required to meet an overall federal budget-neutrality standard. Neutrality should be required for the cumulative budget impact of a proposal involving multiple programs and subsidies, not for each program. States should be allowed to align better the federal subsidies available to their citizens, even if allowing them to do so would require specific changes to one or more forms of coverage.This additional flexibility, however, must be subject to safeguards. While we differ about the extent of the federal safeguards needed to protect state coverage and benefits, we all agree that flexibility should not allow funds for health-care services to be diverted to other purposes. Furthermore, funding for low-income populations must not be diverted to cover higher-income individuals.With this new authority, states could simplify their insurance markets and enable children to receive coverage with their parents. This would allow parents to shop for better and more integrated coverage for their children while retaining the protections established by CHIP. Lawmakers should also consider altering Medicaid, CHIP and tax-subsidy rules to ensure that families without employer coverage for their children can receive support to buy affordable child-only plans. Similarly, states could help healthy adults buy private insurance.We believe that these incremental policies would establish a more equitable health-care system and help families of limited means secure the care they need to remain healthy.Mr. Chen is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and director of domestic policy studies in the Public Policy Program at Stanford University.

Its box-office sales follow a pattern set this year by the eighth \u201cFast and Furious,\u201d fifth \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and Tom Cruise\u2019s reboot of \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d all of which performed similarly at the box office.Such results have become the norm for some of Hollywood\u2019s so-called tentpole movies, which regularly cost more than $200 million to produce and are expected to serve as studios\u2019 biggest moneymakers. A poor showing in the U.S. no longer necessarily discourages studio executives from approving yet another installment in a long-running series, if enthusiasm from overseas moviegoers is high enough.But where grosses originate can have a major impact on studios\u2019 bottom line.Studios keep about 60% of every dollar spent on movie tickets for major hits in the U.S., compared with less than half in many foreign countries and just 25% in China. In addition, China and other developing nations have far smaller DVD, digital and television businesses that can generate ancillary revenue.\u201cThe amount that comes back to the studio changes dramatically, so while the global number can look pretty good, the math of it isn\u2019t the same,\u201d said an executive at one studio experiencing the phenomenon.\u201cThere\u2019s real impact to what that [international] business brings to the overall profitability of a movie,\u201d said       Megan Colligan,        president of world-wide marketing and distribution at             Viacom Inc.\u2019s       Paramount Pictures, which released \u201cTransformers.\u201d The movie\u2019s dismal domestic opening is 31% below the last installment of the series, released in 2014 over four days. Its global gross stands at $265 million.\u201cFast\u201d grossed less domestically than the previous two movies in the auto-adventure series, while the new \u201cPirates\u201d and \u201cMummy\u201d were the worst performers yet in their franchises.Together, the three movies have grossed a disappointing $454 million in the U.S. and Canada but a total of $1.79 billion overseas, with $654 million coming from China alone. Previous films in each franchise earned a higher proportion of their global box office from domestic ticket sales.\u201cThe franchise fatigue we\u2019re seeing in some other markets isn\u2019t so prominent in China,\u201d said       Duncan Clark,        president of international distribution for             Comcast Corp.\u2019s       Universal Pictures, which released \u201cFast\u201d and \u201cThe Mummy.\u201d China is the world\u2019s second-largest box-office market.The mix of foreign ticket sales is changing too, with grosses typically falling in more mature markets like Europe and Australia but staying strong, or growing, in East Asia and Latin America.Lower profits from ticket sales are partially offset by cheaper marketing expenses in other countries, said Ms. Colligan.Studios often have only a few weeks to market a movie in China, as opposed to many months in the U.S. China also offers digital promotions that cost millions less than stateside campaigns.Studios are rethinking their creative approaches to future sequels in hopes of reviving interest among Americans in light of the recent box-office flops. In addition, some fear that audiences in foreign countries such as China will soon grow as weary of these long-running franchises as Westerners have.For American audiences, many of these franchises are too familiar, as are stars like Mr. Cruise of \u201cThe Mummy\u201d and Johnny Depp of \u201cPirates,\u201d say studio executives.\u201cSequels are greeted with a little bit of cynicism in this country,\u201d said Ms. Colligan. \u201cPeople are looking for something that really reimagines what they\u2019re expecting and yet they want the things that are very familiar to them.\u201dIn China, it might help that only about 34 foreign films, most of them from Hollywood, play each year.\u201cThere is a real bubbling enthusiasm for American films, in part because they only get a small slice of them,\u201d said Mr. Clark.\u201cFate of the Furious\u201d is only the third movie in the long-running series to play in China, as is \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\u201dA few big movies this year, including remakes, sequels, and comic book adaptations, have performed well everywhere and bucked the trend. \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d and \u201cWonder Woman\u201d are all major hits domestically while also earning robust revenue internationally.The poor domestic showings for some of this summer\u2019s biggest hits have added to a bruising spring on the stock market for major U.S. movie-theater chains.Shares for the country\u2019s three largest exhibitors\u2014            AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,Regal Entertainment Group                   and             Cinemark Holdings Inc.      \u2014have steadily fallen over the past several months, and disappointing weekends for major releases have further hit the stock price.Domestic box-office disappointments are only exacerbating the pressure already placed on stocks by viewers shifting to streaming services like             Netflix Inc.,       said Robert Fishman, an analyst at research firm MoffettNathanson.\u201cYou\u2019ve seen a reset of expectations\u201d at the box office this quarter, said Mr. Fishman.Write to Ben Fritz at ben.fritz@wsj.com and Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Hollywood\u2019s Misses Are Hits Overseas.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 16:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hollywoods-biggest-misses-are-hits-overseas-1498423748", "news_title": "Hollywood\u2019s Biggest Misses Are Hits Overseas", "keywords": "box office,movie sequels,summer movies,Duncan Clark,Megan Colligan,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies"}, {"content": "Several Republican senators on Sunday expressed reluctance to support their party\u2019s latest health-care bill, adding to the uncertainty about whether some form of the legislation would be able to pass the chamber soon.All but one had previously indicated they were uncomfortable with the draft legislation to overhaul the nation\u2019s health-care system, including repealing key parts of the Affordable Care Act passed during the Obama administration. Some others have expressed misgivings about the bill without ruling out the possibility of supporting it.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is hoping for a vote later this week. His party holds 52 votes in the 100-member Senate, and because all Democrats are expected to oppose the health-care bill, he can lose no more than two GOP votes to pass it.Sen. Luther Strange (R., Ala.) said Sunday he is \u201cnot there yet\u201d in supporting the current plan.\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d he said\u00a0on Fox News. But, he added, \u201cI\u2019m very strongly optimistic that we\u2019re going to get there.\u201dThe bill would reverse the federal funding for the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA, a move that could affect millions of people, and would for the first time limit states\u2019 overall Medicaid funding from Washington. It also would eliminate the requirement in the 2010 law that most Americans sign up for health insurance, and provide instead less-robust tax credits than the ACA to help people afford insurance.In addition, the bill would repeal hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes on businesses and high-income households and retroactively cut taxes on capital gains.\u201cRight now, I am undecided. There are things in this bill which adversely affect my state,\u201d Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said Sunday on             CBS.Mr. Cassidy, who had expressed misgivings previously, cautioned the Republican leadership not to proceed with plans to hold a vote on the bill this week, asking for more time to negotiate on the details after Congress\u2019s July recess.Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who had said last week he couldn\u2019t support the bill, also raised concerns Sunday on the timing.\u201cI don\u2019t have the feedback from constituencies who will not have had enough time to review the Senate bill. We should not be voting on this next week,\u201d Mr. Johnson said on NBC.Mr. Johnson and Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and       Rand Paul       of Kentucky said last week they wouldn\u2019t vote for the bill in its current form because it doesn\u2019t go far enough in rolling back the ACA. Sen. Dean Heller (R., Nev.) said last week he couldn\u2019t support it because of its timetable for a rollback of the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid.The Senate plan echoes a health bill passed by the House last month, but it contains several differences, including a more gradual phasing-out of the funding for the Medicaid expansion.Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), who supports the bill, said Sunday on CBS he \u201cstrongly disagreed\u201d with the notion that it would end the expansion of Medicaid. The Republican bill allows states to keep the Medicaid expansion, but they wouldn\u2019t get the enhanced federal funding for it. That funding would be phased out beginning in 2021 and eliminated in 2024.Mr. Toomey also noted conservative Republicans\u2019 concerns it did not go far enough in cutting costs.\u201cI\u2019m sympathetic about the kinds of reforms they\u2019d like to make to lower premiums\u2026but I see this bill as a first step, a first important step,\u201d Mr. Toomey said.Senator       Susan Collins       (R., Maine), who had previously expressed worries about the bill\u2019s cuts to Medicaid, said Sunday it would be difficult for President       Donald Trump       and Mr. McConnell to come up with a bill that she can support.\u201cI\u2019m very concerned about the cost of insurance for older people with serious chronic illnesses, and the impact of the Medicaid cuts on our state governments,\u201d Ms. Collins said on ABC.Mr. Trump said Sunday he expects to see the Senate pass a health-care bill after further negotiations.\u201cWe have a few people that\u2026want to get some points; I think they\u2019ll get some points,\u201d he said during a Fox News interview that aired\u00a0Sunday.He said of the Republicans who have withheld their support so far: \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re that far off.\u2026I think we\u2019re going to get there.\u201dDemocratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer of New York said members of his party are open to negotiations to \u201cimprove\u201d the current law but that they don\u2019t support the Republicans\u2019 current proposal.Republicans \u201chave, at best, a 50-50 chance of passing this bill,\u201d Mr. Schumer said Sunday on ABC. \u201cThe bill is just devastating\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s what\u2019s making it so hard for them to pass.\u201dWrite to Rachel Witkowski at rachel.witkowski@wsj.com and Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-25 16:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-senators-express-misgivings-about-health-bill-1498418191", "news_title": "GOP Senators Express Misgivings About Health Bill", "keywords": "political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "The animal-rights group that has for years unsuccessfully sought to ban the Central Park horse carriages from city streets has hired three prominent political consultants to resurrect an issue that has dogged New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio during his first term.Tusk Strategies, the consulting firm behind high-profile campaigns against City Hall on behalf of Uber Technologies Inc. and the city\u2019s largest police union, is leading the effort, according to the firm and the other consultants on the campaign.       Suri Kasirer,        a veteran lobbyist, also is on the team, they say.So is       Stu Loeser,        former Mayor       Michael Bloomberg\u2019s       press secretary whose consulting firm has worked on campaigns from Uber to charter schools.All have been hired by New Yorkers for Clean, Livable and Safe Streets, an animal-rights group that backed Mr. de Blasio in the 2013 mayoral race, during which he vowed to ban the carriage industry. About 300 people and roughly 200 horses work in the industry.NYCLASS, an advocacy organization, said it plans to spend millions on a lobbying and advertising blitz this summer in the hopes of winning over New Yorkers and forcing Mr. de Blasio to deliver at least part of his 2013 campaign promise.\u201cWe have to go out and we have to do a better job of convincing folks why in 2017, horses don\u2019t belong in Times Square,\u201d said       Chris Coffey,        who heads the New York City practice at Tusk Strategies. \u201cWe still believe that on the issue, most New Yorkers are with us. We\u2019re going to go out and talk to them and rally them to our side.\u201dMr. de Blasio in 2013 said he would ban the horse-carriage industry during his first week on the job. Instead, the effort was met with intense resistance from carriage drivers and the union representing them, who said the move would have cost hundreds of good-paying jobs.Polls showed most New Yorkers were supportive of the carriage industry. In a December 2014 Quinnipiac University poll, 22% of New Yorkers said they supported banning the industry, while 67% wanted it to stay.The issue appeared to be laid to rest for good in February, when City Council Speaker       Melissa Mark-Viverito       called off a vote on legislation that would have restricted the horses to Central Park. Many city lawmakers said they were relieved and hoped the issue would fade away.Now though, it could be poised to make a comeback, just in time for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s reelection campaign. The mayor met with NYCLASS earlier this month, but hasn\u2019t committed to taking on the issue again, according to people familiar with the meeting.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, is widely expected to win reelection, but the return of NYCLASS\u2014buoyed by a high-powered consultants\u2014could infuse some energy into a race that has so far been a snooze.The lobbying blitz could revive an issue that spiraled into an embarrassing political distraction for Mr. de Blasio, bewildering many in the city\u2019s political world and frustrating his aides. \u201cThey hate the issue,\u201d said one person familiar with the views of his staffers. \u201cIt\u2019s a silly waste of time, and jams them up, and makes them look bad.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. de Blasio declined to comment.NYCLASS is led by       Steve Nislick       and       Wendy Neu,        wealthy developers who have said they are motivated by their love of animals, and argued horses don\u2019t belong in midtown traffic. Together, they poured thousands into attack ads in the 2013 Democratic mayoral primary against then-City Council Speaker       Christine Quinn,        a de Blasio rival.NYCLASS initially sought to completely ban the horse carriages, but Mr. Coffey recently said the group is open to a compromise. That could include, among other things, barring the horses from Times Square, or moving the line of carriages soliciting tourists away from the street and inside Central Park.Carriage drivers are unlikely to be open to curbing the industry.\u201cWhy do we need to re-litigate this?\u201d said       Christina Hansen,        a spokeswoman for the carriage drivers. \u201cThey\u2019ve called us animal abusers and horrible things that we are not. They really just need to go away.\u201dThe new anti-carriage campaign also is expected to target several City Council races this summer, lobbying candidates and current lawmakers in the hopes of gaining much-needed allies on the 51-member body who are friendlier to its agenda.Kenneth Sherrill,        a professor emeritus of political science at CUNY Hunter, said outside money could have a significant impact in shaping the next City Council because the races generally garner low-turnout, making it easier to influence them.\u201cThey can hire people to do phone banking, and leaflet and do get-out-the-vote drives,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can flip the City Council. You can put the fear of God into them.\u201dA spokesman for Teamsters Local 553, the union representing the drivers, said it would in general be very active in City Council races, but declined to comment further.The move by NYCLASS marks a new level of intensity in its yearslong effort. It also brings together a group of high-profile consultants who have worked for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s political rivals.Bradley Tusk,        who heads Tusk Strategies, ran Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s 2009 mayoral campaign and led an open push to unseat Mr. de Blasio last year, scouring the city for challengers.Mr. Tusk and Mr. Coffey were key consultants behind the successful 2015 ad campaign against legislation sought by Mr. de Blasio to restrict for-hire car services such as Uber. Ms. Kasirer, a strategist, was involved in the Uber campaign, as well. She has ties to city politics that date to the administration of Mayor       Rudy Giuliani,        in the early 1990s.Mike Morey,        a Democratic strategist who served as communications director for Ms. Quinn, said NYCLASS had hired \u201csome of the best there are\u201d in Ms. Kasirer, and Messrs. Loeser and Tusk, but believes the effort will fail.\u201cThey\u2019re bringing out substantial firepower, but in a city of over eight million people in which there is a homeless crisis, a crisis of affordability, this is not an issue New Yorkers care about,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost criminal to spend that kind of money on an issue like this.\u201dWrite to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-25 16:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-powered-consultants-join-team-to-curb-nyc-carriage-horses-1498421211", "news_title": "High-Powered Consultants Join Team To Rein In NYC Carriage Horses ", "keywords": "central park horse carriages,new york horse rides,nyc horse carriages,Uber Technologies,Bradley Tusk,Chris Coffey,Christina Hansen,Stu Loeser,Suri Kasirer,animal rights,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The U.S. sees a list of demands put forward late last week from Saudi Arabia and other governments to Qatar as a starting point for discussions to end a three-week standoff, though some conditions will be difficult to meet, Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       said Sunday.The list to Qatar from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, delivered Thursday, includes demands that Qatar shutter state broadcaster Al Jazeera, curb ties with Iran and end Turkey\u2019s military presence on its soil, among others.\u201cWhile some of the elements will be very difficult for Qatar to meet, there are significant areas which provide a basis for ongoing dialogue leading to resolution,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cA productive next step would be for each of the countries to sit together and continue this conversation.\u201dLast week, Mr. Tillerson called for Saudi Arabia and others to issue a list of demands that were \u201creasonable and actionable,\u201d after the U.S. State Department questioned the motives of the Gulf Arab countries\u2019 boycotting Qatar.The Saudis, acting with Egypt, the U.A.E. and others have blockaded Qatar for the past three weeks, closing borders and canceling airline flights while accusing Doha of supporting extremist movements and cultivating ties to Iran.\u201cWe believe our allies and partners are stronger when they are working together towards one goal which we all agree is stopping terrorism and countering extremism,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said Sunday. \u201cEach country involved has something to contribute to that effort.\u00a0 A lowering of rhetoric would also help ease the tension.\u201dHe said the U.S. supports efforts to mediate the conflict by Kuwait and that the U.S. will remain in close touch with all of the parties. The U.S. has allies on all sides of the conflict, and maintains its largest military facility in the Middle East in Qatar.Another world leader who has been trying to mediate between its allies is Turkey. On Sunday President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       reiterated his nation\u2019s support against the demands of its larger Gulf Arab neighbors as against international law.\u201cWe consider these demands are against international law,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in remakes in Istanbul after prayers during the celebration ending the religious fasting month of Ramadan. \u201cIt is a breach of Qatar\u2019s sovereignty rights.\u201dTurkey has strong trading ties with both Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and it has a longstanding military base agreement with Doha. Mr. Erdogan and his government have said they have no plans to re-evaluate that military relationship, despite pressure from Qatar\u2019s neighbors.The list presented last week also demanded that Qatar cut all ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Lebanese military and political movement Hezbollah and other groups that Saudi Arabia and its allies deem extremist and a threat to their rule. The conditions set forth by Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Egypt and Bahrain add up to a radical overhaul of the longtime pillars of Qatari policy and include measures that Doha has said are nonstarters.The U.A.E\u2019s ambassador to Washington said in an interview\u00a0Sunday\u00a0that the onus is on Qatar to de-escalate the crisis.\u201cThis problem requires a diplomatic solution, but the decision to reach a diplomatic solution is on Qatar, it\u2019s not on us,\u201d said Yousef Al Otaiba, the Emirati ambassador. \u201cWe are O.K. with the status quo if Qatar declines to accept the demands.\u201dA spokesman for Qatar\u2019s embassy in Washington said, \u201cWe appreciate the continued efforts of Secretary Tillerson and the U.S. government, as well as the personal involvement of the Emir of Kuwait in mediating this crisis. We are in the process of reviewing the list of demands and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be issuing a response soon. Our response will adhere to Secretary Tillerson\u2019s statement that the list of demands should be reasonable and actionable.\u201dSeparately, Qatar\u2019s emir spoke by phone to Iran\u2019s president on Sunday, according to Iranian state news agency IRNA.\u201cThe blockade of Qatar is not acceptable for us,\u201d Iranian President       Hassan Rouhani       told Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.\u201cWe believe when there is a difference among the regional countries, threat, pressure or sanction are not appropriate ways to settle those differences,\u201d he said, according to IRNA.\u2014Margaret Coker and Aresu Eqbali contributed to this article.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Says Qatar Faces Tough Terms.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 16:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-says-some-demands-on-qatar-will-be-difficult-to-meet-1498411521", "news_title": "U.S. Says Some Demands on Qatar Will Be Difficult to Meet", "keywords": "qatar,qatar blockade,qatar demands,Rex Tillerson,political,general news,international relations,politics"}, {"content": "After superstorm Sandy nearly destroyed a Brooklyn health-care clinic in 2012, officials at NYC Health + Hospitals looked to modular construction for a quick and economical replacement.Now the municipal public health-care system is deploying the technology again, this time to build a $28 million two-story ambulatory-care facility on Staten Island with units made in a Pennsylvania factory and bolted together on site.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be part of our algorithm in terms of deciding how we construct something we need,\u201d said       Roslyn Weinstein,        vice president of corporate operations at NYC Health + Hospitals. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at timing needs, estimates, the size of the lot and whether it\u2019s doable or not doable.\u201dAs the region\u2019s health-care institutions spend billions to modernize and expand, some large providers are boosting their use of factory-made components, sometimes constructing entire facilities from modules and other times using smaller components, such as finished bathroom units, within conventionally built projects.Like builders in the residential and hotel sectors, health-care systems looking to expand have shown a growing interest in modular-building technology as a possible way to deal with a shortage of skilled construction workers and rising building costs, industry officials and experts said.Modular technology\u2019s promise of shortening development schedules, controlling and improving quality and minimizing disruptive work on site also have been a draw, especially for projects in crowded, urban settings with limited space to place building materials and accommodate workers.Nearly 400 bathrooms for patient rooms were built in a New Jersey factory and installed in the new 830,000 square-foot Kimmel Pavilion under way at NYU Langone Medical Center in Manhattan.These factory-made components helped reduce the number of workers on site and potential delays. And it allowed for improved quality control and estimated savings of 15% to 20% for bathroom construction, said       Vicki Match       Suna, senior vice president for NYU Langone\u2019s real-estate development and facilities.\u201cWhen you have our project, a new clinical building which is so complex and has so many systems, using this building component avoids some of the crowding you get,\u201d       Ms. Suna       said.Modular construction cut as much as six months from the entire development process for NYU Winthrop Hospital\u2019s 3,200 square-foot Level 1 Trauma Center in Mineola, Long Island, which made its debut last year, said       Joseph W. Burke,        vice president of engineering and facilities.Ten sections were manufactured in a Midwest factory, while work to prepare the site took place simultaneously. The ambulance bays outside the emergency department had to be relocated temporarily, not an ideal situation. So completing the project in a shorter time-frame was critical, Mr. Burke said.\u201cThe key is the impact to the facility where you are doing this work,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it saves months, it\u2019s a home run.\u201dTo be sure, modular building in the health-care sector is still in its early stages in the New York region. The methods don\u2019t work for every project, particularly highly customized designs without repetitive, standardized features, said health-care and building-industry experts.The factory-made components also bring challenges such as coordinating the design and manufacturing process with local and state inspections, and trucking large units on roadways, especially across bridges.Modular building companies, however, see room for growth, with startups such as New York City-based EIR Healthcare addressing shipping concerns with a concept for a modular hospital room packed flat and assembled on-site, among other things.Efforts to rein in costs in the health-care industry have created a growing appetite for efficient building solutions, industry experts said. And an aging baby-boomer population has put pressure on an industry to build and upgrade facilities quickly.\u201cThere is demand for a higher level of care, and a lot of these long-term-care facilities want to upgrade facilities and build them as fast as they can,\u201d said       Terry Olynyk,        head of general contractor PCL Construction\u2019s Agile division, which focuses on manufactured-building services and products.Over the years, health-care renovations and expansions have been including more modular components such as prefabricated operating room ceilings or headwalls for patient rooms that come with electrical and mechanical systems and equipment, said       Charles Maggio,        a managing director who specializes in the health-care sector at real-estate services firm             CBRE Group Inc.       Hospitals also have been standardizing the design of patient rooms.\u201cI think it\u2019s a doable leap to justify more modular construction for patient rooms,\u201d he said.", "news_time": "2017-06-25 15:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-hospitals-turn-to-modular-construction-to-speed-projects-1498418728", "news_title": "New York Hospitals Turn to Modular Construction to Speed Projects ", "keywords": "hospital construction,modular construction,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,real estate,property,building construction,real estate transactions,health care,life sciences,commercial,industrial real estate,construction"}, {"content": "ROME\u2014Italian authorities said Sunday they were prepared to spend as much as \u20ac17 billion ($19 billion) as part of the shutdown of two regional banks, a deal that will transfer the lenders\u2019 best assets to             Intesa Sanpaolo                   SpA for a nominal sum.The government passed a decree Sunday that will effectively sell the good part of the two banks to Intesa, Italy\u2019s second-largest and best-capitalized bank. Intesa said last week that it would be willing to buy the best assets for a token price of \u20ac1 as long as the government assumed responsibility for liquidating the banks\u2019 large portfolio of sour loans.Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza are midsize lenders in the Veneto, Italy\u2019s prosperous northeast. Both have been flailing for several years despite efforts to shore up their capital and restore their health.On Friday evening, the European Central Bank declared that the pair were set to fail, having \u201crepeatedly breached supervisory capital requirements.\u201dThat set the stage for the government intervention over the weekend, which will involve splitting Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza into good and bad assets.The \u20ac17 billion includes the cost of Rome\u2019s responsibility for the bad loans, along with items such as covering legal exposure, restructuring of the remaining bank and paying for the expense of personnel issues associated with splitting the two banks into a good one and a bad one.The \u20ac17 billion consists of \u20ac5.2 billion to Intesa and as much as \u20ac12 billion in state guarantees, including those protecting Intesa from any negative impact to its capital ratios resulting from the acquisition.At a press conference Sunday, Prime Minister       Paolo Gentiloni       said that the two banks will open regularly Monday. The banks\u2019 situation \u201creached a point that required a rescue to avoid the risk of a disorderly failure,\u201d he said.Italy obtained European Union permission to deal with the Veneto banks using national insolvency laws, thus avoiding inflicting losses on senior bondholders.Intesa\u2019s offer to buy the good bank resulting from this operation was the only \u201csignificant\u201d offer, according to an Italian government official.The case of the Veneto banks is yet another example of Italy wriggling out of strict EU rules built after the financial crisis to prevent taxpayers from footing the bill in the event of the collapse of such institutions as banks.When the EU authority in charge of winding down the bloc\u2019s failing banks\u2014the Single Resolution Board\u2014decided it wouldn\u2019t take the case, it handed all power over to Italian authorities.The SRB said Friday night it wouldn\u2019t take action because neither of the banks would have \u201ca significant adverse impact on financial stability.\u201dSo the two banks will be closed down under national insolvency procedures, and the painful process of EU bail-in\u2014under which junior and senior bondholders absorb the losses\u2014is averted. In Italy, a majority of bonds are in the hands of mom and pop investors.By avoiding the SRB, Italian authorities could work under a softer set of rules dating from 2013 and only had to put forward a state-aid case to the commission.Italian authorities tried in March to use another exception in EU rules to prop up the two Veneto banks. Under so-called precautionary recapitalization, Italy could have injected state money into the ailing lenders, but the commission didn\u2019t approve the plans.Stress tests in 2014 found a multibillion-euro capital shortfall at Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza. A \u20ac3.5 billion capital investment by a government-orchestrated banking fund failed to fill that gap.The two Veneto banks reflect the weakness in Italy\u2019s banking sector, which is struggling to digest about \u20ac200 billion in bad loans and has suffered from low profitability and insufficient capital for years. The two banks have a combined capital shortfall of about \u20ac6.4 billion.\u00a0In March, they requested government help to stay afloat.The government is set in the coming weeks to take control of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy\u2019s No. 4 bank and one whose problems have threatened the larger stability of Italy\u2019s banking system. Rome also had to shut down four small lenders.\u2014Julia-Ambra Verlaine contributed to this article.Write to Deborah Ball at deborah.ball@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Italy Set To Shutter 2 Midsize Lenders.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 15:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/italy-is-prepared-to-spend-billions-in-shutdown-of-two-banks-1498418669", "news_title": "Italy to Spend Up to $19 Billion to Bail Out Two Banks ", "keywords": "bank bailouts,euro crisis,european markets,italian bank bailout,italian bank failures,italian banks,italian politics,italy elections,Veneto Banca,Banca Popolare di Vicenza,Intesa Sanpaolo,ISP.MI,ownership changes,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,divestments,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "This week, inflation figures are due from Europe and the U.S., including the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred price gauge.

K. authorities raised to 60 the number of residential towers in England that have failed fire-safety checks triggered by the lethal blaze in a London high-rise earlier this month, as concerns grew over the safety of residents in social housing.All buildings examined so far have failed the checks, which involve testing samples of their external cladding for flammability, a spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said Sunday.The government has asked landlords to send in samples from the buildings they are most concerned about first, which means that the initial batch is likely to fail the tests, the spokesman said.The 60 buildings which failed the tests are located in 25 areas across England, including north London, Manchester and Plymouth.The exterior facade is suspected of having contributed to the quick spread of the fire that incinerated west London\u2019s Grenfell Tower on June 14, killing at least 79. The government identified about 600 social-housing towers\u2014properties owned by local authorities as well as nonprofit housing associations\u2014across the country that had installed some form of cladding.\u201cWe are now rapidly identifying buildings of concern: samples are being tested very quickly; fire inspectors are checking the safety of the buildings as a whole,\u201d       Sajid Javid,        minister for communities and local government, said in a statement late Saturday.The laboratory handling the samples is able to test 100 of them daily, and further capacity can be provided, he said.The latest number comes after some 650 homes in north London social-housing buildings were evacuated Friday night, following a discovery that their cladding wasn\u2019t fire retardant.The authority initially planned to evacuate around 800 households from five residential towers, but one of the buildings turned out to have better fire safety arrangements than the others and residents were allowed to stay.More than 3,000 people were being temporarily relocated, said a spokesman for the north London local authority handling the evacuation of the four residential towers.The decision was made due to concerns that, combined with inadequate fire-safety arrangements inside the buildings, the cladding posed too much of a fire risk.A significant number of residents were staying with friends and family, with others being housed in two community centers or checked into hotels, the spokesman said.A failure in testing of the cladding doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a building will have to be evacuated, Mr. Javid said in the Saturday statement.The spokesman for Mr. Javid\u2019s department said Sunday he had no knowledge of any further planned evacuations, though the decision would be made by the relevant local authorities.\u201cI\u2019d stress that it was a particular set of circumstances that made the evacuations in Camden necessary,\u201d the spokesman said.Cladding is often used to make a building more energy efficient or improve its outward appearance. In Grenfell Tower, it was installed as part of an \u00a38.6 million ($11 million) refurbishment last year.U.K. officials have said the cladding on the 24-story Grenfell Tower didn\u2019t meet building standards for high-rises taller than 18 meters, or about 59 feet. But British building industry experts and the British company that supplied the material to Grenfell Tower contractors said it complied with current building codes.The deadly blaze had started in a refrigerator-freezer before it rapidly spread across the tower block, police said Friday, and the external cladding tested in the aftermath failed fire-safety tests.Authorities are considering a range of potential charges, including manslaughter, in connection with the fire, Detective Superintendent       Fiona McCormack       said Friday.Write to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'More U.K. High-Rises Fail Fire Checks.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 14:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/number-of-u-k-high-rises-failing-fire-safety-checks-rises-1498414735", "news_title": "Number of U.K. High-Rises Failing Fire-Safety Checks Increases", "keywords": " cladding, fire safety, grenfell tower, london,london fire, residents, social housing, testing,Department for Communities and Local Government,affordable housing,political,general news,society,community,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,man-made disasters,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,social issues,welfare,social services"}, {"content": "Investors and startups in the real-estate technology sector are anticipating a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the coming year as the market continues to grow, according to a new global survey of investors and startup companies.The survey showed that 76% of those polled in the second quarter, said they expected more purchases and mergers of companies in the sector in the next 12 months.

DOW 1.55%       uses to make tiny plastic pellets. Some of the pellets are exported to Brazil, where they are reshaped into the plastic pouches filled with pur\u00e9ed fruits and vegetables.Tons more will be shipping soon as Dow completes $8 billion in new and expanded U.S. petrochemical facilities mostly along the Gulf of Mexico over the next year, part of the industry\u2019s largest transformation in a generation.The scale of the sector\u2019s investment is staggering: $185 billion in new U.S. petrochemical projects are in construction or planning, according to the American Chemistry Council. Last year, expenditures on chemical plants alone accounted for half of all capital investment in U.S. manufacturing, up from less than 20% in 2009, according to the Census Bureau.Integrated oil firms including             Exxon Mobil Corp.       and             Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC are racing to take advantage of the cheap byproducts of the oil and gas being unlocked by shale drilling. The companies are expanding petrochemical units that produce the materials eventually used to fashion car fenders, smartphones, shampoo bottles and other plastic stuff being bought more and more by the world\u2019s burgeoning middle classes.\u201cIt\u2019s a tectonic shift in the hemispherical balance of who makes what to essentially feed the manufacturing sector,\u201d said Dow Chief Executive       Andrew Liveris,        referring to the growth of production in the U.S. His company now plans to double down on its U.S. expansion with a $4 billion investment in a handful of projects over the next five years.Companies are eagerly launching new U.S. petrochemical projects\u2014310 in all according to the Chemistry Council\u2014because at a time of uncertainty over when demand for transportation fuels may peak, due to electric cars and ride sharing, the world\u2019s appetite for plastics is expected to rise for decades to come.That demand typically grows at least 1.5 to 2 times as fast as global gross domestic product, according to industry analysts. That theoretically makes petrochemicals one of the safer fossil fuel investments, though skeptics question whether the margins on U.S.-made plastics can last.The new investment will establish the U.S. as a major exporter of plastic and reduce its trade deficit, economists say. The American Chemistry Council predicts it will add $294 billion to U.S. economic output and 462,000 direct and indirect jobs by 2025, though analysts say direct employment at plants will be limited due to automation.For energy companies, the build-out creates a new market for byproducts they previously had little use for. Drillers have been flush for years with the raw materials but have left them in the gas stream to be burned off, because no one wanted them. A spike in demand in coming years could make drilling more profitable.Petrochemical companies are betting the price of the feedstocks\u2014their most costly expense\u2014will remain low for years due to shale drilling. As a result, net U.S. petrochemical exports, which include plastic as well as products such as fertilizer, adhesives and solvents, will grow to $110 billion a year by 2027 from $17 billion last year, according to             IHS Markit.       That would come close to the value of Saudi Arabia\u2019s current annual oil exports.\u201cThere\u2019s no other industry that comes close to that level of growth,\u201d said IHS economist       Thomas Runiewicz.Many of the companies investing in the U.S. are foreign, including Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned chemical company and some of the largest petrochemical companies in Brazil, Japan and Thailand.In April, Exxon said it selected a site near Corpus Christi, Texas, for a $9.3 billion petrochemical complex it is building jointly with Saudi Basic Industries Corp. The proposed facility, the largest of its kind in the world, is expected to be done by 2021 and produce 1.8 million metric tons a year of ethylene, the main component of plastic.\u201cWe don\u2019t see this as a bet,\u201d said       Neil Chapman,        president of the chemicals unit at Exxon, which is investing a total of $20 billion in such projects along the Gulf of Mexico. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to pinch yourself sometimes and say \u2018this is the envy of the world.\u2019 \u201dDow\u2019s plant in Freeport, Texas, when fully operational by the end of the year, will produce 1.5 million metric tons of ethylene annually. The company plans to export at least 20% of the plastic it makes in the U.S. and is particularly eyeing Latin America as a ripe market.Dow expects plastic baby food containers will be a booming business in Brazil, where an increasingly career-oriented female population is favoring prepared baby foods in innovative packaging to save time, according to a 2015 World Health Organization study.

She can also barely pay rent.Hardy, who lives in downtown Brooklyn and trains at the borough\u2019s famed Gleason\u2019s Gym, is a single parent and supports her 12-year-old daughter, Annie, by the grace of her gloves. Since turning pro in 2012, Hardy has become one of the highest paid females in her sport with sponsorships from Dove and Adidas and the loyalty of established New York promoter Lou DiBella. Still, she averages about $10,000 per fight, while men with comparable resumes bring in six figures or more per bout.\u201cIt seemed like nothing was working,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed a backup plan.\u201dOn Saturday, she put that plan into action at Madison Square Garden in her first mixed-martial arts fight, where the money is greater, but the risks are, too.The showdown against flyweight Alice Yauger was broadcast on Spike TV, the first fight on live TV for Hardy, something she hopes will bring national exposure to women\u2019s boxing. More airtime means more money. With money comes freedom for Hardy to move between combat sports as she pleases, not just when the bills are due.After developing big-name female fighters such as Ronda Rousey, MMA offers more gender-equitable purses than boxing. Though neither Hardy nor DiBella would say what she made from Saturday\u2019s fight, they said it was more than what she earned in her WBC title-defense victory over Edina Kiss in March.But MMA is also in some respects more violent than boxing\u2014one reason for its popularity\u2014and not automatically an easy transition for a 35-year-old making her first appearance in the cage.\u201cIf I get injured, then my boxing career is over too,\u201d Hardy said before the fight. \u201cThis is probably the most dangerous back up plan outside of being a hit man.\u201dHardy didn\u2019t survive her MMA debut unscathed. Four minutes into the third round, the referee paused the match to let Hardy mop up the blood from her split left eyelid. Then, seconds after the doctor cleared Hardy to resume fighting, Hardy pushed Yauger against the cage and began landing fist after fist in her opponent\u2019s face to win by technical knockout.When asked afterward if she took more damage in MMA than boxing, Hardy admitted, \u201cI didn\u2019t see my face yet.\u201d The final tally: seven stitches and a gnarly looking eye.The bout was Hardy\u2019s second attempt at an MMA debut, as her first fight in January was canceled when opponent Brieta Carpenter withdrew at the last minute due to injury.\u201cThey just left her high and dry. She got paid nothing,\u201d DiBella said.Hardy\u2019s financial situation was aggravated by the New York state assembly\u2019s move last August to revise health insurance regulations for combat sports, making boxing matches for women in New York prohibitively expensive.Hardy says she was on the precipice of poverty before receiving an anonymous check in the mail from someone who sent money to pay for Annie\u2019s Christmas gifts. A second check arrived a month later for rent.\u201cI was pretty much saved by the kindness of strangers,\u201d she said.With an adjustment to the New York law, women\u2019s matches resumed again early this year in mid-January.After two boxing bouts this spring, Hardy says her finances aren\u2019t as dire. But debts still loom. To prepare for an MMA fight, Hardy must cover the cost of gym time and trainers specializing in jujitsu, wrestling and grappling on top of her regular boxing and conditioning workouts\u2014about $700 a month.Those in her corner say not to bet against her.\u201cShe is like the pioneer in trying things there,\u201d said Devon Cormack, Hardy\u2019s longtime trainer at Gleason\u2019s. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t quit.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-25 13:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/undefeated-boxer-and-single-mom-takes-on-a-new-fight-1498411294", "news_title": "Undefeated Boxer (and Single Mom) Takes on a New Fight ", "keywords": " alice yauger, boxing,heather hardy, heather the heat hardy, mma, spike tv, world boxing featherweight,boxing,combat sports,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "At least 138 people were killed and nearly 150 others injured after gasoline spilling from an overturned fuel truck caught fire in central Pakistan on Sunday, officials said.The truck was traveling on a highway around 300 miles south-southwest of the capital Islamabad when it flipped over, spilling its contents, police said.

Casual deskside drinking had to go.\u201cPeople were not thrilled,\u201d says       Liza Landsman,        a Jet executive who in 2015 helped launch the website, which sells everything from detergent to designer purses, and is now president.Jet employees were accustomed to the perks and quirks of a startup that raised more than $500 million from investors. They had the requisite pool table, cold-brew coffee on tap and conference rooms named after comic-book locations.While those things stayed, an array of liquor in an office kitchen cupboard marked \u201cBar\u201d didn\u2019t. Some Jet employees squirreled away a few bottles before an outside company packed up the contraband, says one former employee.\u201cI would not say it\u2019s a party culture, but not the opposite of that,\u201d says another former Jet employee.In fact, Wal-Mart had made a major concession to Jet\u2019s thousands of employees by allowing Jet to pay for an off-site happy hour. There are no champagne toasts at Wal-Mart headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., thanks to a cocktail of conservative culture and a strict low-cost ethos.Benton County, where the company has been based since       Sam Walton       opened his first store in 1950, prohibited the sale of alcohol until 2012. Wal-Mart generally doesn\u2019t allow employees to expense alcohol during work outings, let alone drink in the office.\u201cPeople don\u2019t really talk about drinking at work because you don\u2019t want to have that reputation,\u201d says Bo Yarbrough, a former recruiting manager at Wal-Mart. Increasingly, employees gather at the growing number of local bars for weekday happy hour after work, \u201cbut you wouldn\u2019t want to put that kind of thing on a work calendar,\u201d says Mr. Yarbrough, who left the retailer last summer.Jet is based in Hoboken, a city where some locals brag about the high number of bars per capita. Jet founder       Marc Lore,        a New York native, is a wine aficionado and owner of a small vineyard in California\u2019s Napa Valley. Lore Vineyard\u2019s 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon earned a coveted 97 points from the Robert Parker Wine Advocate for its \u201cfabulous intensity and loads of blackberry,\u201d though recent vintages aren\u2019t sold to the public.Wal-Mart\u2019s absorption of Jet is part of its intensifying battle with             Amazon.com Inc.       After buying the company, Wal-Mart put Mr. Lore in charge of its U.S. e-commerce business and swallowed several other online startups, including San Francisco\u2019s ModCloth, which sells women\u2019s apparel, and Michigan\u2019s Moosejaw, an outdoors specialist. This month, it paid $310 million for New York City-based Bonobos Inc., another apparel seller.Mr. Lore and Wal-Mart CEO       Doug McMillon       discussed the potential culture clash in meetings before the Jet acquisition, including what to do with the startup\u2019s office drinking, says Ms. Landsman, Jet\u2019s president. The executives invented the off-site happy hour compromise to preserve \u201ckey touchstones in the culture\u201d that made Jet\u2019s entrepreneurial talent valuable to Wal-Mart in the first place, she says.Several months ago, Mr. McMillon asked Jet executives whether the retail giant was \u201chugging\u201d Jet too tightly or not enough, she said. Jet executives said things were largely going well but many employees had stopped coming to happy hour after it was moved outside the office.\u201cOne of the huge advantages of the office was the ability to float in and out,\u201d mingling, then going back to work at your desk, says Jack Hanlon, a Jet vice president.Wal-Mart reversed course. In recent weeks Jet brought back Thursday night happy hour in the office\u2014generally beer, wine and food. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big signal from Wal-Mart that they were able to be flexible,\u201d says Mr. Hanlon.The change is permeating the empire. Wal-Mart had wine and beer at a tailgate for its e-commerce team in San Bruno, Calif., when it hosted its annual day at a San Francisco Giants game in May. It is \u200balso\u200b allowing other startups it has acquired to host a weekly office happy hour\u2014pending approval from a Wal-Mart executive vice president.The employees at Madison Heights, Mich.-based Moosejaw, which Wal-Mart bought in February, never lost access to the \u201c4 p.m. beer fridge\u201d and keg, unlocked for one hour on Thursdays. \u201cIt helped that our beer fridge had always been run responsibly,\u201d with a two-beer maximum, Moosejaw CEO Eoin Comerford said.Mr. Lore spoke to Bonobos staff in New York the day of the acquisition and cited Wal-Mart\u2019s newfound flexibility on office drinking as an example of how hard it will work to protect culture, said a Wal-Mart spokesman.There are other aspects of Wal-Mart\u2019s traditional habits that still raise eyebrows among Jet staffers.

The strongest arguments for universal income center on its elimination of work disincentives by the unconditional nature of such grants. Current methods of income-support either create distortions by high marginal effective tax rates or phasing out benefits or they directly distort through interventions like the minimum wage. There is much to debate about the proposal for a universal income, and I am skeptical as to whether it would in fact replace other policies because of political temptations to meddle. It is not, however, possible to conduct a rational debate over how best to approach serious social problems when straw men are deployed to ridicule a well-considered argument that deserves a well-considered response.Em. Prof. Richard WallaceWofford CollegeSpartanburg, S.C.The lure for liberals of a UBI is obvious. Those who view the state as the best steward of collective well-being would have the state take care of us all. UBI produces game, set and match for statists, bringing an end to what remains of rugged individualism and small government. What political party could possibly launch a successful UBI repeal-and-replace campaign in an America teetering on the edge of fiscal collapse? And if the U.S. has a problem with illegal immigration now, imagine what happens when statists push through the UBI and soften border-security enforcement. Some wealthy conservatives have hopped on the UBI bandwagon as well, partly out of compassion and partly as a \u201cgive the left-behind masses some cake and maybe they\u2019ll leave us alone\u201d strategy.If liberals realize their UBI dream, our Washington income suppliers ought to draft an American Declaration of Dependence. Our refounding document should codify that we all are endowed by the state with unalienable rights, that among these are a life of leisure, an adequate degree of liberty and enough cash to buy some happiness. The freedom to pursue happiness doesn\u2019t, after all, buy cash.Ryan GrahamMelbourne, Fla.A universal basic-income program should be considered, not because there won\u2019t be enough jobs for everyone, but because it would be more efficient and less subject to fraud, waste and abuse than the multitude of federal, state and local programs that form our nation\u2019s safety net. An effective UBI program would replace Social Security, SNAP (food stamps), unemployment insurance and numerous other complex financial assistance programs. The UBI program would provide only enough income to meet each individual\u2019s basic needs. Most people would still work to earn additional income, as most people aspire to more than just survival.Robert Sommers, Ph.D.Jacksonville, Fla.The ideas of Mesrs. Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Robert Reich are evidence that educational intelligence and the ability to make money have no correlation with having common sense. There can be no universal basic income to give anybody unless somebody is working to create what is to be given away. Who do they think will do that? It\u2019s just like the minimum wage.

Our 50-state study found that most states \u201cbalance\u201d their budgets while overestimating revenues and underestimating expenses. In some states, loan proceeds are considered revenue and hundreds of billions in costs aren\u2019t included.The largest budgeting gimmick relates to deferred compensation. Each year employees earn their compensation, which includes their salaries and portions of their pension and retiree health-care benefits. Over the years, to avoid including the true compensation costs in the budgets, elected officials have chosen not to fund more than $800 billion of pension benefits and more than $600 billion of retiree health-care benefits.These budgeting shenanigans have made it impossible for the voters to hold their elected officials accountable. State legislators, city council members and other elected officials have been re-elected based on voters believing that the governments\u2019 budgets were balanced. But the budgets weren\u2019t balanced. Would voters have voted differently had they understood their governments were running deficits?

It also formed the centerpiece of a grand political bargain: By committing to sever the link between weak banks and over-indebted sovereigns, governments prepared the way for European Central Bank president       Mario Draghi\u2019s       2012 promise to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the eurozone, including buying government bonds.Yet the decision over the weekend to spare two failed Italian lenders from the full force of those new rules raises questions about the banking union.The centerpiece of the new regime was the Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive\u2014rules to ensure that no taxpayer money is used to bail out banks and that losses fall on private-sector creditors\u2014and the creation of the Single Resolution Board to oversee the process. There was relief last month when this new regime was tested for the first time by the failure of the Spanish lender Banco Popular, which was sold to Santander for one euro after its shareholders and junior bondholders had been wiped out, with no adverse effect on the market.But\u00a0Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vincenza\u00a0will be spared the same treatment. Using a loophole in the BRRD, the Single Resolution Board has ruled that the two banks are not systemically important and therefore can be liquidated under Italian insolvency rules, which permit the use of government cash without the need for senior bondholders to take losses.The plan is that the good assets of the banks will be transferred to             Intesa Sanpaolo                   for a euro, but the bad assets and the cost of redundancies will be left with the government, which faces a potential hit of up to \u20ac17 billion, which includes a \u20ac5 billion capital injection to cushion Intesa against losses.The EU Commission insists this is not a loophole and that the possibility of using national as opposed to eurozone-level insolvency regimes was clearly envisaged under the Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive. It points out that a number of failed banks have been liquidated using national insolvency regimes since 2015.Even so, this decision has still taken most observers by surprise. The two Italian banks, though smaller than Banco Popular, were large enough to be supervised by the European Central Bank. It therefore was widely assumed that their resolution would also be handled at the European level. Instead, it now appears that the SRB has discretion as to whether to apply the BRRD rules.Meanwhile the eurozone finds itself in the odd situation where systemically unimportant banks are eligible for state aid, while systemically important banks must be subject to full bail-in.It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the SRB\u2019s decision to spare senior bondholders in the two lenders is primarily political.Italian authorities have been fighting a rear-guard action to save the two banks from insolvency for two years, not least because they are major employers and because many of the bondholders are retail customers of the banks who may not have known the risks they were taking when they bought what were marketed as high-interest savings products. Liquidating the banks under national rules at least removes the risk that 300,000 retail bondholders might be hit by substantial losses less than a year before a general election is due. But where does this leave the banking union?No one wants to reignite a new political crisis in the eurozone just as the economy, including that of Italy, appears to have finally turned a corner.Importantly, the decision to put the liquidation into the hands of the Italian authorities is not being questioned by Germany. From Berlin\u2019s perspective, it is enough that it has headed off a long-standing attempt by Rome to try to keep the banks alive by injecting government capital using another controversial BRRD loophole known as precautionary recapitalization. The decision to spare senior bondholders represents a pragmatic compromise to a saga that has cast a shadow on the Italian and eurozone banking system for too long\u2014and which German officials believe should have been addressed years ago.Nonetheless, Berlin wants reassurance that this deal doesn\u2019t set a precedent and that the state-aid rules will be rigorously applied to minimize the use of taxpayers\u2019 money, according to German officials.In recent weeks, there has been much speculation about a fresh political push to strengthen the eurozone, including the creation of new mechanisms to pool banking risks via a common backstop to the eurozone\u2019s Single Resolution Fund and a common deposit-insurance scheme.But the Italian episode highlights that before any steps can be taken to complete the banking union, new measures may be needed to strengthen the rules already in place.Write to Simon Nixon at simon.nixon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-25 12:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/deal-on-italian-banks-raises-questions-about-eurozone-rules-1498407926", "news_title": "Deal on Italian Banks Raises Questions About Eurozone Rules", "keywords": "euro crisis,european banks,european central bank,european commission,italian banks,italian debt,italian election,sovereign debt,European Central Bank,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Is baseball dead again?Every season, there\u2019s a fresh wave of worry that the grand American sport of baseball is in terminal decline\u2014that the summer game is too boring, too slow, too long, too out-of-sync with our hectic, over-scheduled, very, very, very important modern lives.Baseball is an old, unhurried game played without a clock\u2014how does it possibly fit into an efficiency-crazed, on-demand, instant gratification society, in which\u2014behold the miracle\u2014a magic hand-held space phone can be used to order same-day delivery of one battery, one avocado, and one shower curtain to the house, in three separate packages?Baseball can\u2019t win in go-go times like these. The latest alarm comes via Sports Illustrated, and its admired baseball dean Tom Verducci, who paints a fretful portrait of a sport overly dominated by swing-and-miss home-run sluggers and strikeout pitchers, with not a lot of action in between:Then there\u2019s this: As of Sunday, the average Major League game in 2017 is clocking in at three hours, four minutes, which is four minutes slower than last year and, if the season ended today (dare to dream!) would be the longest average game time in baseball history. In the early 1980s, the average MLB game lasted two-and-a-half hours. Through World War II and some years later, the average was just over two\u2014and those folks didn\u2019t even have             Netflix                   queues to watch.Baseball fans can be sensitive about this complaint. The Journal\u2019s excellent baseball writer, Jared Diamond, chases me around the newsroom with a tattered copy of Roger Kahn\u2019s \u201cBoys of Summer\u201d whenever I needle him about baseball\u2019s relevancy. As both Jared and Verducci note, the game is thriving as a business\u2014TV ratings for the Cubs-Indians World Series last year were a total smash, and ESPN just announced its numbers for Sunday Night Baseball this season are up 13% from last year.It gives a bit of a \u201cMonty Python and the Holy Grail\u201d quality to the \u201cBaseball is Dead\u201d talk:I\u2019m not dead yet.He says he\u2019s not dead.Well, he will be soon, he\u2019s very ill.And baseball is an easy target. Compared with the NFL\u2019s slick futuristic packaging and the NBA and its youthful emoji wars, baseball can seem like a piece of hard candy on your grammy\u2019s shelf. And three hours is a problem. Nothing should be more than three hours: no movie, no hike, no dinner, no graduation ceremony, no meeting, no wedding, no sport.(This is the part where Jared would interrupt to tell me the average NFL game was more than three hours, eight minutes last season\u2014four minutes longer than baseball. And he\u2019s right!)So cut football, too! I\u2019m a radical when it comes to sports duration. Baseball should immediately shrink from 162 to its former 154. I think the NBA and NHL season could easily cut 25 games and nobody would complain (besides, you know, owners, TV networks and player unions.) Malcolm Gladwell was on Bill Simmons\u2019s Ringer podcast the other day arguing that with all we know today about injuries and recovery, every sport should be cutting games, because players would play better, and it would create sharper, more satisfying contests that would thrill fans and benefit every sport over the long run. He\u2019s right. That\u2019s why he\u2019s Malcolm Gladwell.Simmons replied that sports are far too beholden to money to make schedule cuts like that\u2014and Simmons is also right, which is why I embrace employing all in-game ideas to accelerate play, too. Clocks for pitchers, cutting time outs, eliminating coaching visits, on-screen commercial breaks\u2014let\u2019s do it now. But my favorite idea I\u2019ve heard out there in the baseball universe is something I\u2019ve endorsed here before:Seven inning games on weeknights.I think it\u2019s a winner, people. You want a classic nine inning baseball experience, long enough to roast a turkey, do your taxes on your phone, and take an hour-long nap\u2014you can get it Friday through Sunday. But a game Monday through Thursday\u2014we\u2019re going to play seven innings.Stop me when you think any of this sounds like a dumb idea. You\u2019re not stopping me! Even the Blue Jays general manager seemed open to it. Everyone recognizes that no game should be an endurance contest, especially on a work night. Here in New York at Yankees and Mets games, there\u2019s a pronounced \u201cseventh-inning flee\u201d during weeknight contests, when fans start calculating how long it will take them to get home, as they mull their 8:45 morning meetings the next day, and then sprint out of the stadium as if they\u2019re being chased by a stegosaurus.If you think that nine-inning games are something that makes major league games special, and that seven-inning games are a bit too much like youth baseball\u2014let\u2019s make youth baseball games five innings! Little League games should be three innings. Maybe two. (There\u2019s not a Little League parent on earth who would disagree with that.)Yes: I know there\u2019s an argument that slashing innings could simply cause \u201cgame creep\u201d\u2014that all the things that make an interminable nine-inning game would make an interminable seven-inning game. That\u2019s why I\u2019d also add the pitch clock (Why 20 seconds? Make that baby 10!), eliminate stepping out of the batters box, no more than one pitcher switch per half-inning, and, if it goes into extra innings, there\u2019s this: We\u2019re going to three balls for a walk, and two strikes for a strikeout. If you want to stick a runner on second base at the start of an extra inning to make it even spicier, do it.I\u2019m going to win a Nobel for this, aren\u2019t I?I know some of you might be thinking: Hey don\u2019t you like bike racing and tennis\u2014and those sports have five and six hour events! Doesn\u2019t that make you a hypocrite?Yes! I\u2019m a sports columnist! Rampant hypocrisy is in the job description!The good news for baseball is that it has a commissioner Rob Manfred who recognizes these problems, who doesn\u2019t appear wedded to tradition, and is open to adaptation and acceleration. That\u2019s a hopeful development. What baseball\u2019s confronting isn\u2019t much different from what every workplace in America is confronting. Anyone in a business amid a siege of modernization and cutbacks will recognize management\u2019s favorite double-talk maxim:Do more, but with less.That\u2019s really all baseball needs. So play ball!

The department has been looking at whether Canada is selling softwood lumber, used mostly in the construction of houses, into the U.S. at below-market prices.The anti-dumping duty, a type of tariff on imports designed to protect U.S. producers from unfair competition, would come just two months after the Commerce Department found Canadian lumber producers benefited unfairly from government subsidies. After that finding, the Trump administration slapped an initial 20% tariff on imported Canadian wood.A new ruling against Canada could push the average tariff on Canadian softwood lumber above 30%, according to trade lawyers at law firm Dickinson Wright. A Canadian government spokesman said he wouldn\u2019t speculate on what the Commerce Department will decide.In 2016, the U.S. imported over $5 billion worth of Canadian softwood lumber.U.S. and Canadian officials continue to talk about a negotiated settlement, although Canadian Foreign Minister       Chrystia Freeland       said recently the two sides remain far apart. Trade watchers worry that letting the current row drag on any longer threatens to cast a pall over trilateral talks between the U.S., Canada and Mexico for a revamped Nafta, which formally begin in mid-August.\u201cIt would certainly be an advantage to both countries to settle the softwood issue outside of the Nafta negotiations. Having them injected into the Nafta negotiations would be a mistake because it would add an enormously complex issue to those talks,\u201d said Lawrence Herman, a Toronto-based trade lawyer and former Canadian diplomat.The bulk of wood used to produce Canadian softwood lumber comes from forests on publicly owned land. Canada\u2019s provincial governments, which have responsibility over forest management, charge private companies a fee in exchange for the right to harvest.This regime has fueled decades of complaints from the U.S. government and lumber industry. The U.S. argues the fees charged by the province tend to be significantly lower than they would be in an open-market environment, and hence gives Canadian producers an unfair advantage over their U.S. peers. More than two-thirds of U.S. lumber comes from privately held land and is sold on a market basis.The U.S. has also complained about rules that limit the export of raw logs in the west-coast province of British Columbia, where most Canadian softwood lumber is located. The regulations artificially suppress the price of Canadian lumber, U.S. producers say.Commerce Department Secretary       Wilbur Ross       has said the decadeslong disagreements over softwood lumber illustrate the shortcomings of Nafta, which President Donald Trump called a \u201cdisaster\u201d and now seeks its renegotiation. U.S. Trade Representative       Robert Lighthizer       told Congress last week the administration intends \u201cto move very quickly\u201d on Nafta talks.Mr. Ross is said to be engaged on the softwood-lumber issue, and in frequent touch with senior Canadian officials such as Ms. Freeland and Canada\u2019s chief envoy in Washington, David MacNaughton.He told The Wall Street Journal this month the administration is \u201ctrying to solve some of the little disputes with Canada,\u201d much like the U.S. did with Mexico over sugar. With that country, a tentative pact caps the amount of refined sugar that Mexico can send to the U.S.\u201cDisputes are resolvable if people are of reasonable will and are willing to make reasonable compromises,\u201d Mr. Ross said.Canada will only agree to a deal that works for its domestic lumber industry, which ships roughly two-thirds of its exports to the U.S., Ms. Freeland has said.The U.S. Lumber Coalition, an industry group, said it wants the amount of \u201csubsidized\u201d Canadian lumber entering the U.S. limited.\u201cThe Americans are willing to cut a deal.

Some centrist Republicans, meanwhile, say they have concerns over elements in the current bill such as a one-year stripping of funding for women\u2019s health organization Planned Parenthood and cuts to Medicaid funding to the states.Mr. Trump also called the Democrats\u2019 \u201ctheme of resist\u201d as an \u201cobstruction\u201d to the bill\u2019s passage. However, he said former President       Barack Obama       wasn\u2019t leading that resistance, instead pointing to Democrats Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\u201cIt would be so great if the Democrats and Republicans could get together, wrap their arms around it and come up with something that everybody\u2019s happy with,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we won\u2019t get one Democrat vote, not one\u2026and it\u2019s a terrible thing.\u201dWrite to Rachel Witkowski at rachel.witkowski@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-25 11:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-expects-republican-health-care-bill-to-pass-1498403779", "news_title": "Donald Trump on Senate Health Bill: A \u2018Narrow Path\u2019 But \u2018I Think We\u2019re Going to Get It\u2019", "keywords": " fox news, gop health care, health care bill, obamacare, repeal,trump,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house"}, {"content": "DORTMUND, Germany\u2014Germany\u2019s main center-left political party on Sunday attacked Chancellor Angela Merkel for what its leaders characterized as a failure to stand up to President       Donald Trump,        signaling that the U.S. relationship will be a prominent campaign issue ahead of the national election here in September.The Social Democrats pounced on Ms. Merkel\u2019s promise that Germany will move toward spending 2% of its economic output on defense\u2014a target agreed to in 2014 by American allies in Europe and emphasized by Mr. Trump in recent months.Mr. Trump\u2019s demand would mean \u201ca Germany\u2014surrounded by friends\u2014that has armed itself to the teeth in the middle of Europe,\u201d Social Democratic chancellor candidate Martin Schulz told an arena in Germany\u2019s industrial heartland, at the party\u2019s convention. \u201cI ask you: Do we want this? We know from our history: More security does not come with more weapons.\u201dMr. Schulz amplified his months of criticism of the 2% spending goal even though the Social Democrats have served as the junior partner in Ms. Merkel\u2019s governing coalition since 2013. But the allusions to Mr. Trump at Sunday\u2019s convention showed how the new U.S. president\u2014whose approval rating among Germans is 5%, according to a recent poll\u2014is coloring European politics.\u201cWe must be self-confident in countering President Trump,\u201d former Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der said, recalling his own opposition to President       George W. Bush       and the Iraq war. \u201cThis seems to be somewhat lacking now.\u201dMs. Merkel, who is running for a fourth four-year term, represents the center-right Christian Democrats and holds a roughly 15-point lead in the polls over Mr. Schulz. She has also sought to distance herself from Mr. Trump, but has used softer language. She told a beer-tent audience in Bavaria last month that the times in which Europe could completely rely on others were \u201cpartly past.\u201d\u201cOne could also have said: We don\u2019t know whether or not we can still rely on the United States,\u201d Mr. Schulz said after needling Ms. Merkel for being too vague. \u201cBut we know very well that we can\u2019t rely on an aimlessly wandering President Donald Trump.\u201dMs. Merkel last year pushed through parliament an 8% increase in German military spending to \u20ac37 billion, a sum representing 1.2% of gross domestic product. Mr. Schulz said Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, did need billions of euros more in military spending\u2014but not a level that would give it \u201cthe biggest army of our continent.\u201dRalf Stegner, a deputy chairman of the party, said opposition to Mr. Trump and the 2% spending goal would become \u201ca central issue in the campaign.\u201d\u201cTrump, in a negative sense, will play a big role in how the SPD positions itself,\u201d Mr. Stenger said in an interview, using his party\u2019s acronym. \u201cThis is a question that moves the German public.\u201dBeyond the crowd-pleasing Trump criticism, however, delegates acknowledged that Ms. Merkel would be hard to unseat. Her actions on the world stage, some said, appear to have been enough to persuade voters she would defend German and European interests against challenges from Mr. Trump. Several expressed particular frustration with her frequent appearances alongside the popular new French President       Emmanuel Macron,        who was praised by Mr. Schulz and other convention speakers.The Social Democrats\u2019 poll numbers shot up to a near-tie earlier this year with the Christian Democrats when party elders tapped Mr. Schulz, a former president of the European Parliament, to lead the campaign to unseat Ms. Merkel. But that period of euphoria\u2014which delegates here referred to as the \u201cSchulz hype\u201d\u2014ended with a string of regional election losses this spring and the emergence of a seemingly re-energized Ms. Merkel.Polls show that Ms. Merkel has nearly regained the popularity she enjoyed before the influx of refugees and migrants in Germany in 2015 cost her support. An Infratest Dimap poll earlier this month found she was Germany\u2019s most popular politician, with an approval rating of 64%.\u201cThe chancellor has a natural advantage in her executive position, and she is playing it very skillfully,\u201d said Stephan Gr\u00fcger, a Social Democratic regional lawmaker in the western state of Hesse. \u201cShe fills some of the voters with pride\u2014they say, \u2018Our Angela!\u2019\u201dThe Social Democrats\u2019 role in governing Germany alongside Ms. Merkel since 2013 adds to their difficulty as the Sept. 24 election approaches: The Social Democrats have to find ways to criticize Ms. Merkel\u2019s record while defending their own moves in her government.The party promised to lower taxes on low and midlevel earners and not to raise the retirement age. It also criticized Ms. Merkel for failing to engage in policy debates\u2014something Mr. Schulz referred to as \u201can attack on democracy.\u201dMr. Schulz faces a narrow path to the chancellery. According to current polls, even a coalition between all three left-of-center parties\u2014the Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens, and the radical Left\u2014would only represent about 40% of the vote, well short of a parliamentary majority. Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, on the other hand, could forge a governing coalition with the Greens, with the business-friendly Free Democrats, or again with the SPD.\u201cWe must acknowledge that Angela Merkel is very deft at politics,\u201d said Manfred Ruhland, a delegate from Bavaria.Write to Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Emerges as Bigger Issue in German Campaign.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 11:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumpand-merkels-response-to-himis-issue-in-german-election-1498403405", "news_title": "Trump\u2014and Merkel\u2019s Response to Him\u2014Is Issue in German Election ", "keywords": "european politics,german election,german military spending,german politics,german refugee crisis,germany coalition,nato,nato spending,Donald Trump,Gerhard Schr\u00f6der,Martin Schulz,Ralf Stegner,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Profitability is still a struggle for many banks, especially outside the U.S.It isn\u2019t just about high capital requirements, low interest rates or poor investment activity. It is also about overcapacity: there are simply too many banks.One big reason is that policy makers, perhaps unwittingly, have created barriers to exit, according to the Bank for International Settlements.Support measures and regulations to protect the financial system that have been put in place since the financial crisis are propping up banks that in normal times would shrink, close down or get bought. Some of these need re-examining.There are several ways to measure how banking capacity has changed. The number of licensed banks has fallen in both the U.S. and European Union since 2007\u2014by almost 30% in the former but by just 16% to the end of 2015 in the latter, according to the latest data.This hasn\u2019t necessarily reduced capacity, though. The number of physical branches per 100,000 people has barely changed in the U.S., Japan and much of Europe, according to The World Bank. Spain has had a big decline, but still has far more branches than Italy and twice the number per head of the U.S.So what is the issue? First, bank mergers and takeovers collapsed after the crisis and haven\u2019t really recovered. In Europe, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, and Dani\u00e8le Nouy, Europe\u2019s chief bank regulator, have called for more consolidation. But executives aren\u2019t biting. They are afraid of how regulators will treat them. Any big bank that grows in size and complexity is likely to face higher capital demands. That could hurt returns and limit dividend-paying capacity.Another way of cutting capacity would be allowing banks to fail. In Europe, that still seems difficult, despite regulatory efforts to make it less so. This is down to political queasiness over enforcing the rules, especially in the weakest markets where failures are most likely, like Italy.Spain has just forced through the resolution and sale of a failing bank, but Italy is still struggling to find a way around the rules and deal with several stuttering lenders large and small.Overcapacity is a problem across Europe, more so than the U.S. Regulators can point out this problem. It would be better to start coming up with solutions, too.Widespread deregulation isn\u2019t the answer, but Europe should move faster to create a true single market for banking\u2014like that in the U.S..

Hospitals wouldn\u2019t need the subsidies as more Americans gained insurance coverage, ACA policymakers believed.The cuts under the existing law, which take effect in 2018, total $43 billion through 2025.As the Obamacare repeal took shape, hospitals raced to lobby Congress\u00a0to have the funds restored, urging Republicans to give the money back should repeal roll back coverage gains.The Senate health bill would give hospitals the money back\u2014but not in states that expanded Medicaid.If the Senate health bill becomes law, hospitals in expansion states would likely see rising numbers of uninsured patients and they would still face disproportionate share cuts.In New York, those cuts would total $6.3 billion between 2018 and 2025, according to the Greater New York Hospital Association.The Congressional Budget Office estimated 23 million more Americans would be uninsured under the House ACA repeal bill. The CBO hasn\u2019t yet released estimates for the Senate bill.Some hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid have cried foul.\u00a0The Senate health bill \u201ctargets\u201d expansion states for additional cuts, said C. Duane Dauner, president and chief executive of the California Hospital Association. \u201cThe impact on California will be severe,\u201d he said.But in Texas, which didn\u2019t expand Medicaid, Senate provisions would \u201cprovide equity,\u201d said Ted Shaw, president and CEO of the Texas Hospital Association.VIEW InteractiveThe Affordable Care Act offered states federal funding to expand Medicaid, which the Senate bill would continue through 2024, he said. The House GOP bill would end the extra Medicaid funds in 2020.Texas and other non-expansion states don\u2019t receive that enhanced funding, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not equitable.\u201d The District of Columbia and 31 states accepted the funds, while 19 chose not to.States and the federal government jointly finance Medicaid, with states covering up to 50% of the cost. The ACA offered to pay 100% of the cost for those newly insured under expansion, with the federal share gradually falling to 90%.In addition to restoring the Medicaid disproportionate share payments to non-expansion states,\u00a0the Senate bill would increase the payments between 2020 and 2024 under a formula to address states with lower-than-average amounts. \u201cI know there\u2019s some intent there to provide equity,\u201d Mr. Shaw said.Non-expansion states would benefit from other provisions in the Senate GOP health bill.In those states, a swath of low-income people make too little to qualify for the ACA\u2019s subsidies to buy private insurance, and are also not benefiting from Medicaid expansion. The Senate bill would extend eligibility for premium subsidies to about 2.6 million more adults with income below the federal poverty line, according to estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing for a non-expansion state,\u201d said Mr. Shaw.\u00a0Expansion state residents could eventually benefit as well if the law rolls back Medicaid expansion and those people turn to private insurance.But the Senate bill also eliminates subsidies to help offset deductibles\u00a0starting in 2020,\u00a0 which could reach $6,000 to $7,000, said       Gary Claxton,        a vice president at the foundation.

Simply hanging on to more of it might be a good idea.That is particularly the case after the first half of 2017 has delivered good results across the board. Most strikingly, both bonds and stocks are up. The MSCI World index of developed-market stocks is up 9.7% so far this year, while long-dated bonds are also partying, with the 30-year Treasury yield falling around 0.25 percentage point to just 2.73%, boosting prices. Corporate-bond yield spreads are back to their tightest levels since the global financial crisis.Yet falling bond yields and rising equity markets are sending conflicting signals: the former reflecting the lackluster picture for inflation; the latter hopes for growth. Bond yields are still ultralow, while equity valuations are high, with the S&P 500, for instance, trading for 17.6-times forward earnings. This disconnect only can hold if the path of global growth and inflation don\u2019t change markedly. A divergence in either direction will mean that one of the asset classes will have to rethink its assumptions. The jury is out on what happens from here: hopes of a fiscal bump to growth led by the U.S. have faded, while the recent decline in oil prices may cause new worries about headline inflation.More significantly, perhaps, the flood of global central-bank liquidity that has supported markets is past its peak: the Federal Reserveis raising rates, and the European Central Bank is inching toward an exit from ultraloose monetary policy.While policy makers don\u2019t want to shock markets, global output gaps are closing. The need for monetary largesse is therefore no longer as clear-cut as it was. The policy debate at the Bank of England is clear evidence of that, with a sudden and surprising shift toward potential tightening of policy.In this environment, faced with unappetizing initial valuations, not investing might be a valid strategy. For a long time central banks have sought to make cash as unattractive an asset as possible\u2014going so far as to introduce negative interest rates in Japan and Europe. But the more expensive financial assets like bonds and equities get, the less relatively expensive cash looks. The latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch global fund manager survey shows cash holdings at 5% of assets under management, above the 4.5% long-term average but lower than last year.Building up cash doesn\u2019t reflect a particular fear that a big shock, like a new recession, is about to hit. And there are still pockets in markets where the picture is fundamentally brighter, such as in European equities or in emerging markets. Instead, it is a tactical play\u2014selling some assets and raising cash here is about locking in profits and creating room for maneuver. There have been big opportunities even as markets have continued their broad upward journey: think of the U.S. high-yield bond selloff that started in 2015, and the swoon in stocks in early 2016, as oil cratered. Or think of when bond yields rose in the wake of       Donald Trump\u2019s       election. Those turned out to offer attractive buying opportunities as markets rebounded\u2014if investors had cash to exploit them.Different types of investors vary in their ability to keep some dry powder, of course. The catalyst for deploying it isn\u2019t clear either. But, after a strong first half, raising cash to invest at higher yields or lower prices appears wise.Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Sometimes It Pays Not to Invest.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 10:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-everything-is-expensive-not-investing-is-a-great-option-1498399202", "news_title": "When Everything Is Expensive, Not Investing Is a Great Option ", "keywords": "bonds,equities,equity valuations,heard on the street,interest rates,monetary policy,msci world index,s&p 500,stocks,economic news,equity markets,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "SHANGHAI\u2014Nearly 100 people remained missing after a deadly landslide in an area of southwestern China that had been the focus of geologic concern since a devastating 2008 earthquake.Sichuan province authorities said Sunday that more than 3,000 rescue workers\u00a0were combing through the rubble after the landslide swept through the remote mountain village of Xinmo in Maoxian county Saturday\u00a0morning, swallowing 62 homes. Authorities said there was little chance of finding any survivors, citing the depth of the layer of fallen rock.Amid the confusion of the emergency rescue operation, authorities in Sichuan said that 10 people were confirmed dead and 93 were missing, downgrading the number of recovered bodies released\u00a0by state media Saturday. The Sichuan provincial government said through its social-media account that 15 people, including two children, thought to have been buried in the landslide had been found safe and well.Local TV news reports showed that authorities were also working to unclog a local river that had been blocked by rocks and debris from the landslide.The landslide followed persistent seasonal rains, though geologists said Maoxian has been vulnerable ever since a devastating earthquake struck Sichuan in 2008, killing over 87,000 people and weakening the mountainous region\u2019s geology. Maoxian is 25 miles from Wenchuan, the epicenter of the 2008 quake.The Maoxian region has always been prone to earthquakes and landslides, but the 2008 disaster left some of Sichuan\u2019s mountains dangerously unstable,\u00a0Tian Tingshan, deputy director of the Center for Geological Disaster Emergency Technical Guidance of the Ministry of Land and Resources, told local media\u00a0Sunday.The Chinese government relocated people from towns and villages hit hardest by the 2008 earthquake, and has been known to move residents from disaster-prone areas. Since 2008 the authorities have surveyed large areas of Sichuan to identify potential hazards and formed emergency-response plans, said Fan Xiao, a geologist based in Sichuan\u2019s capital, Chengdu. But the remoteness and high altitude of many of Sichuan\u2019s peaks, including the one above Xinmo village in Maoxian, make it difficult to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment, he said.Moreover, some villagers in at-risk areas are reluctant to be moved from their homes, despite official warnings that they could be in danger, Mr. Fan said.A landslide also claimed 10 lives in Maoxian during the summer monsoon three years ago, according to state media reports.\u2014Kersten Zhang in Beijing contributed to this article.Write to Trefor Moss at Trefor.Moss@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Rescuers Hunt China Landslide Victims.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 10:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-races-to-find-landslide-victims-1498399201", "news_title": "China Races to Find Landslide Victims ", "keywords": "china, earthquake, landslide, maoxian, missing, sichuan, southwestern china, xinmo,political,general news,disasters,accidents,earthquakes,volcanic activity,landslides,natural disasters,catastrophes,risk news"}, {"content": "JAKARTA, Indonesia\u2014Two suspected militants with possible Islamic State links attacked police in western Indonesia Sunday, killing one officer, authorities said.Police shot one assailant dead and critically wounded the other in the predawn attack on a police post, while an officer died of stabbing injuries, national police spokesman Setyo Wasisto said.In a raid of one of the men\u2019s houses afterward, police found an Islamic State flag and a book about the terrorist group, Mr. Wasisto said.He added that the men likely had links to Bahrun Naim, an Indonesian based in the Middle East who police say helped channel funds from Islamic State to carry out coordinated attacks with guns and bombs in downtown Jakarta last year.

You arrive at the coffee shop, look around quizzically, and a woman you don\u2019t recognize approaches. A display only you can see highlights her face and prints her name next to it in crisp block lettering, Terminator-style. Afterward, you\u2019ll get an automatically generated transcript of everything the two of you said.As the iPhone this week marks the 10th anniversary of its first sale, it remains one of the most successful consumer products in history. But by the time it celebrates its 20th anniversary, the \u201cphone\u201d concept will be entirely uprooted: That dog-whisperer scenario will be brought to you even if you don\u2019t have an iPhone in your pocket.Sure,             Apple        AAPL 0.63%       may still sell a glossy rectangle. (At that point, iPhones may also be thin and foldable, or roll up into scrolls like ancient papyri.) But the suite of apps and services that is today centered around the physical iPhone will have migrated to other, more convenient and equally capable devices\u2014a \u201cbody area network\u201d of computers, batteries and sensors residing on our wrists, in our ears, on our faces and who knows where else. We\u2019ll find ourselves leaving the iPhone behind more and more often.Trying to predict where technology will be in a decade may be a fool\u2019s errand, but how often do we get to tie up so many emerging trends in a neat package?Apple is busy putting ever more powerful microprocessors, and more wireless radios, in every one of its devices. Siri is getting smarter and popping up in more places. Meanwhile Apple is going deep on augmented reality, giving developers the ability to create apps in which our physical world is filled with everything from Pok\u00e9mon to whatever IKEA furniture we want to try in our living rooms. All these technologies\u2014interfacing with our smart homes, smart cars, even smart cities\u2014will constitute not just a new way to interact with computers but a new way of life. And of course, worrisome levels of privacy invasion.Apple\u2019s acquisitions\u2014it buys a company every three to four weeks, Chief Executive Tim Cook has said\u2014tend to be highly predictive of its future moves. Since it first bought Siri in 2010, Apple has continued to make acquisitions in artificial intelligence\u2014Lattice Data, Turi and Perceptio among them, all of which specialize in some form of machine learning. The company is reportedly working on its own chips for AI.Apple\u2019s preview of iOS 11, with deeper integration of Siri than ever, suggests it hopes to make Siri capable of doing nearly everything on an iPhone that we currently do through its touch interface.Apple has also made many acquisitions related to augmented reality\u2014the overlay of computer interfaces and three-dimensional objects on a person\u2019s view of the real world\u2014including Primesense and Metaio. Mr. Cook has said he is so excited about AR he wants to \u201cyell out and scream.\u201dBy 2027, the problem of bulky AR headsets like Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens should be solved, which means Apple and others are likely to release some sort of smart eyeglasses. With their ability to convincingly supplement our visual and auditory reality, delivering information at the time and place most appropriate, they\u2019ll occasion a cultural change as big as the introduction of the smartphone itself.\u201cWhat you\u2019re going to see with all this augmentation is the psychology of using your phone could change dramatically,\u201d says Ryan Walsh, a partner at venture-capital firm Floodgate who from 2014 to 2016 directed product management for media at Apple. \u201cInstead of using your phone to get away from the world, you\u2019ll use it to join in the world in a much deeper and more meaningful way,\u201d he says.Augmented reality and artificial intelligence will also benefit from the Internet of Things trend: everyday gadgets getting sensors, actuators and a wireless internet connection. Apple controls smart-home products with HomeKit. It aggregates health information with HealthKit, and ties in the car (CarPlay), cash register (Apple Pay) and even the StairMaster (GymKit). Apple clearly wants its devices to connect to everything on Earth.With our every action mapped to every outdoor and indoor space we inhabit\u2014combined with the predictive power of AI and distributed across a suite of devices for which Siri has become the default interface\u2014the result could be a life directed by our gadgets, a sort of \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d for our daily routines.At first, this will be straightforward. Having automatically filled our calendars using the kind of scheduling AI that already exists, our devices will direct us from one task to another, even suggesting transportation\u2014ridesharing, mass transit or flying car. But the relationship will change as the AI gets to know more about you.\u201cYou might be walking by someplace and it might tell you, \u2018Hey, you should go in here, they make a great cup of coffee and there\u2019s also this person you really would like, too\u2019,\u201d says Jonathan Badeen, co-founder and chief strategy officer of dating app Tinder, where he leads teams that think about how to incorporate Apple\u2019s latest technology into apps.By 2027, Apple and its competitors will also have cemented a world of tradeoffs: If you want your life enhanced by AI and all the rest of this tech, you\u2019re going to have to submit to constant surveillance\u2014by your devices or, in many cases, by the tech giants themselves.\u00a0Apple\u2019s bet is that you will trust it to do this: The company\u2019s privacy stance is that it isn\u2019t going to look at or share your data, and it will be encrypted so others can\u2019t look at it, either.Getting used to that won\u2019t be easy. Just as getting in a stranger\u2019s car or sleeping in a stranger\u2019s home seemed crazy before Uber and Airbnb, the 2027 iPhone\u2019s most important differentiator may be our willingness to accept things we can\u2019t even fathom today.Appeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'In 10 Years, iPhone Won\u2019t Be a \u2018Phone\u2019.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-10-years-your-iphone-wont-be-a-phone-anymore-1498395600", "news_title": "In 10 Years, Your iPhone Won\u2019t Be a Phone Anymore", "keywords": "ai,ar,artificial intelligence,augmented reality,body area network,machine learning,predictions for future iphones,siri,wearables,Apple,AAPL,political,general news,living,lifestyle,personal technology,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications technology,equipment,mobile communications equipment,personal electronics,cellular,mobile phones,handheld electronic devices,smartphones,technology"}, {"content": "For almost two decades, author       Mary Gaitskill       put off reading \u201cCloudsplitter,\u201d a historical novel by       Russell Banks       about real-life abolitionist John Brown, because she didn\u2019t like the title.\u201cI thought it sounded pretentious,\u201d Ms. Gaitskill told The Wall Street Journal in a recent phone interview. Spurred by a recommendation from her husband, writer       Peter Trachtenberg,        she finally finished the book last summer and she concluded that it was the best novel she had read in more than a year. \u201cOnce I started it, I realized \u2018Cloudsplitter\u2019 is just a name of a mountain that       John Brown       lives near and that took away from the feeling of pretension.\u201dMs. Gaitskill, the author of such works as the short-story collection \u201cBad Behavior\u201d and the novel \u201cTwo Girls, Fat and Thin,\u201d is the guest host of the WSJ Book Club and she selected \u201cCloudsplitter\u201d for the members of the club to read over the next month.Brown was a white anti-slavery crusader who in 1859 led an attack on a federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., with the larger aim of sparking a slave rebellion. He was captured and executed that same year, but his martyrdom helped galvanize the abolitionist movement and inspired songs like the Union Army marching number \u201cJohn Brown\u2019s Body.\u201d \u201cCloudsplitter\u201d tells the story behind Brown\u2019s exploits and is narrated by his adult son, Owen. Ms. Gaitskill said she didn\u2019t know much about Brown before reading \u201cCloudsplitter\u201d but she was quickly won over by the 758-page novel\u2019s \u201cscope and quality and depth.\u201dMs. Gaitskill, who recently published an essay collection titled \u201cSomebody With a Little Hammer,\u201d talked to The Wall Street Journal in a phone interview. An edited transcript follows.What makes \u201cCloudsplitter\u201d special?One of the reasons I liked it was for the complexity of the characterization. Banks portrays Brown as not exactly crazy but as emotionally stupid. His son comments repeatedly that there are things that [his father] does not understand emotionally. Also he\u2019s a very rigid egomaniac and yet at the same time he\u2019s presented as genuinely outraged over slavery...He\u2019s very mixed morally and that\u2019s how I see most people as being.In an author\u2019s note at the beginning of \u201cCloudsplitter,\u201d Banks writes that while some of the characters and incidents in the book are real, he\u2019s altered and rearranged facts \u201cto suit the strict purposes of storytelling.\u201d Do you think there are any rules to writing historical fiction that authors need to follow?My basic feeling is if it\u2019s a novel, you have a lot of leeway. Because novels do not represent themselves to be factually true. I know that Banks made up certain things. There is a scene where       Owen Brown       meets a woman on a ship who he really has a profound conversation with and he thinks they have perhaps shared a romantic moment and she kills herself that night. I was haunted by the idea that this might have actually happened, and so I looked it up and it didn\u2019t and I was a little disappointed. But if [a book] is calling itself a novel, right away, it\u2019s not bound to represent what\u2019s literally true.How do you go about selecting titles for your books?\u201cBad Behavior\u201d honestly was not my title. The only reason I accepted it was because it was my first book and I was not confident in my ability to pick a title. It was actually my editor\u2019s boyfriend that picked it and I didn\u2019t like it, but they didn\u2019t like my title which was \u201cDaisy\u2019s Valentine\u201d and which I actually think is better\u2026The title [\u201cSomebody With a Little Hammer\u201d] is from a quote from       Chekhov       that\u2019s in my essay in the book. There are some translations where the line reads \u201cthere ought to be a man with a hammer\u201d and I thought that seemed almost threatening. When I realized it was \u201csomebody with a little hammer\u201d that was just right for my title.Why is there an image of the indie comic book character Cerebus the Aardvark on the cover of \u201cSomebody With a Little Hammer\u201d?I actually designed that cover. That design was originally the cover of a journal that I did that I felt like decorating. I showed it to my editor and she really liked it and it\u2019s Cerebus the Aardvark because I really like the image and I\u2019m a Cerebus fan.What should readers look for as they read \u201cCloudsplitter\u201d?If I\u2019m reading for enjoyment, I\u2019m not really reading that critically. If something works for me, it\u2019s very intuitive and natural, I\u2019m not reading with a fine-tooth comb or looking for things they might be doing wrong or looking for things they might be doing right. I\u2019m just receptive to it, and if I enjoy it I\u2019m going to keep reading. I don\u2019t even care if it\u2019s good or not frankly, if I enjoy it I\u2019m going to keep reading. And if it\u2019s not enjoyable, I don\u2019t care if someone thinks it\u2019s great, I\u2019m not going to keep reading it.", "news_time": "2017-06-25 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mary-gaitskill-picks-cloudsplitter-for-wsj-book-club-1498395601", "news_title": "Mary Gaitskill Picks \u2018Cloudsplitter\u2019 for WSJ Book Club", "keywords": "book club,books,cloudsplitter,reading,the wall street journal book club,wsj book club,political,general news,arts,entertainment"}, {"content": "GRONINGEN, The Netherlands\u2014For decades, the giant Groningen gas field beneath the flat, green farmland in the north of this country counted among the greatest prizes for             Exxon Mobil Corp.        XOM 0.31%       and             Royal Dutch Shell        RDS.B 0.58%       PLC.Then the earthquakes started.The exploitation of Groningen\u2014the biggest gas field in Europe\u2014has been causing tremors for over two decades, rattling a bucolic province with no previous history of quakes and exposing two of the world\u2019s biggest energy companies to a criminal probe and rising reconstruction bills.Amid a public outcry, the Dutch government has imposed increasingly strict limits that have more than halved Groningen\u2019s gas production since 2013. Now, authorities are proposing another 10% cut in hopes of further reducing earthquakes. And a Dutch public prosecutor is preparing to open a criminal investigation into responsibility for the earthquakes.Shell and Exxon are pushing back through their joint venture, Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij BV or NAM. The venture says cutting output even more is \u201cout of proportion and not effective,\u201d and would create uncertainty about the legal framework for its operations. It warns that continuous changes to the production level may ultimately threaten the business\u2019s profitability.NAM said it is considering formally contesting the government\u2019s decision. It also expressed surprise at the Dutch court order to the prosecutor to open a criminal investigation this year, since the authorities had previously found no grounds for such action. The state will take a decision on whether to prosecute once the investigation is complete.Groningen was expected to be one of the world\u2019s largest gas producers for decades to come. Last year, it made up almost 10% of both Exxon and Shell\u2019s total gas production globally and its reserves are among the companies\u2019 largest undeveloped resources.VIEW PhotosMoreover, the field\u2019s profits have been lucrative for the Dutch government, which not only collects taxes from NAM but is also a 40% stakeholder in the field. Since production began, the field has generated almost \u20ac300 billion ($335 billion) for Dutch coffers.Exxon named restrictions on Groningen as a factor contributing to a nearly 4% decline last year in its global natural-gas output. Shell said Groningen issues were largely responsible for a decline of 636 billion cubic feet in proven reserve estimates for its European joint ventures, equivalent to nearly 2% of the company\u2019s total gas reserves at the end of 2016.Under the current arrangement, the government bears 64% of the costs related to compensation to residents, efforts to reinforce buildings, lawsuits and other items.It isn\u2019t the first time seismic activity has caused controversy in the energy industry. A U.S. debate has raged for years over whether water injection related to drilling has caused earthquakes in Oklahoma and Texas. Earthquakes like the ones in Groningen are less known and less understood.Groningen\u2019s quakes were first officially linked to gas production in the 1990s, nearly 30 years after work on the field began. Decades of production have caused pressure in the porous ground containing the gas-bearing reservoir to decrease, according to the Shell-Exxon venture and the Dutch government. That increased the stress on natural faults, resulting in the earthquakes, the company and government say.The tremors have caused widespread damage, though no deaths, in a province of nearly 600,000 people.A large majority of the temblors registered low magnitudes of between 1.5 and 2, and early on NAM dismissed them as little more than a nuisance. But the public and authorities snapped to attention in 2012, when an earthquake of magnitude 3.6 rippled through Groningen province.\u2018The impact on the houses and streets is a split second. There are no rocks in between.\u2019The region\u2019s homes and infrastructure, built on flat land, weren\u2019t designed to withstand even such low seismic instability. The tremors occur where Groningen\u2019s gas lies\u2014just under 2 miles below ground level. That relatively shallow depth, and more significantly the soft, clay-like topsoil in much of the region, make for stronger ground movements than expected from earthquakes of such magnitude, according to the Netherlands State Supervision of Mines, which regulates gas extraction.\u201cThe impact on the houses and streets is a split second. There are no rocks in between,\u201d said       Hans Alders,        a Dutch government official appointed to oversee efforts to strengthen and repair the province\u2019s buildings and infrastructure.In a 2015 report, the Dutch Safety Board said NAM and the country\u2019s Ministry of Economic Affairs failed to \u201cact with due care for citizen safety\u201d and didn\u2019t adequately research the risks posed by earthquakes.\u2018Safety is, and always has been, our primary focus.\u2019The government said it has recognized that mistakes have been made and has implemented the report\u2019s recommendations.NAM hasn\u2019t disputed the findings and has made several public apologies. It has acknowledged liability for earthquake-related damage and paid out hundreds of thousands of euros in compensation, poured millions more into a fund to stimulate the region\u2019s flagging economy and put aside more than \u20ac1 billion, mostly for a program to strengthen and repair buildings in the area. The bill is expected to grow.NAM said while it would meet all its liabilities, it isn\u2019t possible to predict the exact costs of strengthening and repair in the years ahead.The gas company could also be on the hook for nearly \u20ac8 billion to fully compensate residents throughout the region for losses to property value and psychological damage, said       Pieter Huitema,        a Groningen lawyer who brought two successful civil suits on those issues.NAM is appealing both lawsuits and said all numbers relating to the size of potential liabilities are unsubstantiated. The company said it already has a system to compensate residents for lower property values and needs more clarification on how to establish psychological damages.\u2018The sooner they stop, the sooner there will be no earthquakes.\u2019Both Shell and Exxon said they are confident NAM could produce gas safely. \u201cSafety is, and always has been, our primary focus,\u201d Exxon said in an email.The earthquakes have unexpectedly persisted\u2014albeit at a lower level\u2014despite the Dutch restrictions on Groningen output. That unpredictability, and a belief that NAM failed to present an adequate plan to mitigate it, prompted the Dutch regulator to recommend the further output reduction earlier this year.Jelle van der Knoop,        president of the residents\u2019 association Groninger Bodem Beweging, said many residents want gas production to end altogether.\u201cThe sooner they stop, the sooner there will be no earthquakes,\u201d Mr. van der Knoop said.Write to Sarah Kent at sarah.kent@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Dutch Quakes Rattle Exxon, Shell.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 08:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/earthquakes-rattle-exxon-shell-gas-operation-in-netherlands-1498392001", "news_title": "How Earthquakes Are Rattling a Dutch Province Atop One of the World\u2019s Richest Gas Troves", "keywords": "earthquakes, natural gas,Exxon Mobil,XOM,Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij,Royal Dutch Shell,RDSB.LN,RDSA.LN,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,disasters,accidents,volcanic activity,landslides,natural disasters,catastrophes,risk news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,electricity,gas utilities,integrated oil,gas,utilities"}, {"content": "Macau billionaire Ng Lap Seng will head to Manhattan federal court on Monday to face charges that he orchestrated an elaborate scheme to bribe Caribbean diplomats to the United Nations, in a trial expected to put a spotlight on China\u2019s ambitions at the international organization.Prosecutors allege that Mr. Ng, a colorful real estate and casino mogul, paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to ambassadors to the U.N. from Antigua and Barbuda and the Dominican Republic to get the organization\u2019s support for a multibillion-dollar conference center he and a suspected Chinese intelligence agent planned to build in the Chinese gambling haven of Macau.Mr. Ng wanted the center to serve as China\u2019s official venue for U.N. events, according to court documents, including the annual expo of the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, which works with developing countries. A representative for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.At trial, prosecutors will seek to prove that Mr. Ng, who has pleaded not guilty, both controlled the payments and intended for them to be bribes, according to court documents. Mr. Ng, who turns 69 years old Monday, has been under house arrest in his Manhattan apartment one block from U.N. headquarters since October 2015, secured by a $50 million bond. Prosecutors will try the case without assistance from       John Ashe,        a former U.N. official and potential cooperator who died in an incident described as a weight-lifting accident.The defense has indicated in court papers that it will argue Mr. Ng\u2019s payments weren\u2019t bribes, rather legitimate donations in accordance with U.N. practice.Mr. Ng\u2019s lawyers argue the case has been improperly driven by a \u201cU.S. geopolitical interest in slowing the progress of Chinese influence over developing nations,\u201d calling it an \u201cunprecedented prosecution stretching the bounds of federal interest and intruding forcefully into the internal affairs of the United Nations.\u201dThe government has rejected such claims. But prosecutors plan to present at trial evidence purporting to show the involvement of Mr. Ng\u2019s associate, Qin Fei, in the proposed Macau project, according to court documents. U.S. officials suspect Mr. Qin is a Chinese intelligence operative, according to people familiar with the matter.Though he hasn\u2019t been accused of any wrongdoing by U.S. officials, Mr. Qin has surfaced in additional federal cases in Brooklyn. Former Air China employee Ying Lin, who has pleaded not guilty to charges she smuggled packages for Chinese military officials, was designated by Mr. Qin as an agent for a $10 million mansion he purchased in Long Island, property records show. The airline hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing.In a separate case, Dan Zhong, a former Chinese diplomat who is also the nephew of a Chinese billionaire, has pleaded not guilty to forced labor charges in conjunction with work his construction company did on Mr. Qin\u2019s house and other projects.A representative for Mr. Qin, who is believed to be in China, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for Ms. Lin and Mr. Zhong didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Mr. Ng\u2019s trial, which is estimated to last three to four weeks, is expected to cast the U.N. in a harsh light.Francis Lorenzo, the government\u2019s star witness, is a former diplomat to the U.N. representing the Dominican Republic whom Mr. Ng allegedly bribed to gin up support for the Macau center, according to court documents. Mr. Lorenzo, who in April pleaded guilty to bribery, money laundering and other charges, is expected to testify for the better part of a week, according to his attorney.A representative for the U.N. declined to comment.An unusual development involved the death last June of Mr. Ashe, who had previously served as president of the U.N. General Assembly and as Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s ambassador to the U.N. Mr. Ashe had pleaded not guilty to filing false tax returns connected to the alleged bribes but had been engaged in plea negotiations with prosecutors when he died at his Westchester County, N.Y., home, according to court documents. The official cause was \u201ctraumatic asphyxia...while lifting a barbell on a bench.\u201dMr. Ng, whose net worth prosecutors have pegged at nearly $2 billion, boasts high-level political connections from Beijing to Washington. He is a member of the Chinese government\u2019s top advisory body, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference. In his Macau office he displays photos of himself with politicians such as Bill and       Hillary Clinton       and former Chinese presidents Jiang Zemin and       Hu Jintao,        according to a person who knows him. In 2001, Mr. Ng joined       Donald Trump       and other investors in a bid for a Macau casino license, documents and people familiar with the matter say. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump has said the president hadn\u2019t been \u201cseriously considering\u201d the ultimately unsuccessful bid.Mr. Ng\u2019s attorneys have sought to portray their client, who rose from peasant roots in southern China, as a philanthropist, not a briber. The defendant has been called \u201ca human living Buddha\u201d for his donations to disaster relief funds and children\u2019s charities, according to a biography accompanying a 2011 prize from the World Peace Prize Awarding Council.\u2014Nicole Hong contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-06-25 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/macau-billionaire-heads-to-trial-in-u-n-bribery-case-1498392001", "news_title": "Macau Billionaire Heads to Trial in U.N.

In 2015, as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals AG, Mr. Shkreli bought the rights to Daraprim\u2014a decades-old drug that fights toxoplasmosis, a potentially life-threatening parasitic infection\u2014and raised the price from $13.50 to $750 a pill.Mr. Shkreli defended that move, saying he had an obligation to \u201cmaximize our profit\u201d for his investors. After his December 2015 arrest, Mr. Shkreli told The Wall Street Journal that federal law enforcement had targeted him because of the Daraprim price increase and his brash public persona.That persona hasn\u2019t diminished since his arrest: Mr. Shkreli has taunted U.S. congress members and Democratic presidential candidates, feuded with rap artists and journalists, and maintained a steady stream of social-media bluster.\u201cI am the original internet troll, child,\u201d Mr. Shkreli tweeted at a film student, days before his arrest. Mr. Shkreli was kicked off             Twitter                   earlier this year, after a reporter said he and his acolytes were harassing her.Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyers are seeking to distinguish their client\u2019s public behavior from his actions as an executive, which they say didn\u2019t amount to criminality.For the trial, which is expected to last four to six weeks, the government said it would call investors in Mr. Shkreli\u2019s hedge funds to testify, among dozens of potential witnesses.Ben Brafman, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyer, said at a pretrial hearing last Monday that the government had taken a \u201cmyopic view\u201d of Mr. Shkreli\u2019s relationship with investors, noting that all of the investors were eventually repaid. \u201cThe question is whether he intended to defraud them.\u201dMr. Shkreli is \u201ctraveling to the beat of his own very unique drummer, if you will,\u201d Mr. Brafman said in court, calling him a \u201cboy genius.\u201d In a later statement, Mr. Brafman said: \u201cMr. Shkreli and his lawyers intend to try this case in the courtroom, not via social media or in the press.\u201dMr. Brafman said the defense would decide later whether Mr. Shkreli would take the stand.Mr. Shkreli grew up in Brooklyn, the son of Albanian immigrants. In 2006, he founded his first hedge fund, Elea Capital.In 2009, Mr. Shkreli launched a new hedge fund, MSMB Capital, raising $3 million from eight investors. He was named to Forbes\u2019 30-under-30 list, hailed as an upstart activist hedge-fund manager.But prosecutors say his apparent success was built on lies. At one point, according to the 2015 indictment, Mr. Shkreli told MSMB Capital investors he had $35 million under management, when the fund had less than $700 in its accounts. Mr. Shkreli didn\u2019t tell investors that he had earlier lost all the money he managed at Elea, and that Lehman Brothers had a $2.3 million default judgment against him, prosecutors said.By September 2012, MSMB Capital had lost all of its assets, losses that Mr. Shkreli tried to conceal from investors, according to the indictment.Meanwhile, Mr. Shkreli was raising capital for a new fund, MSMB Healthcare: Between February 2011 and November 2012, he convinced 13 investors to give him $5 million. Prosecutors said Mr. Shkreli falsely claimed that the new fund at the time had $55 million under management.To conceal mounting losses, prosecutors allege Mr. Shkreli produced phony performance reports and misappropriated assets from pharmaceutical company             Retrophin,        RTRX 3.54%       Inc., a company he\u2019d founded in 2011 focused on developing therapies for rare diseases.In his alleged misconduct involving Retrophin, prosecutors say Mr. Shkreli was assisted by Mr. Greebel, who served as outside counsel to Retrophin. Among other allegations, prosecutors say that Mr. Greebel, Mr. Shkreli and others doctored documents to predate a transfer of Retrophin shares to one of the MSMB funds.Mr. Greebel was also arrested in December 2015 and faces two counts of conspiracy. His trial was severed from Mr. Shkreli\u2019s earlier this year, after Judge       Kiyo A. Matsumoto       ruled that trying the two men together could compromise Mr. Shkreli\u2019s right to a fair trial.Mr. Greebel\u2019s lawyer,       Reed Brodsky,        declined to comment.Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyers, for their part, have said they would defend Mr. Shkreli on two of the counts on grounds that he was relying on Mr. Greebel\u2019s legal advice.Appeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Shkreli Trial Jury Selection to Start.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jury-selection-to-begin-in-martin-shkreli-trial-1498388405", "news_title": "Jury Selection to Begin in Martin Shkreli Trial ", "keywords": "daraprim,elea capital,evan greebel,federal securities fraud,martin shkreli,martin shkreli federal securities-fraud trial,martin shkreli trial,msmb capital,retrophin,Retrophin,RTRX,Martin Shkreli,Ben Brafman,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,financial crime,fraud,juries,securities fraud,wsj pro industry - law,pharmaceuticals,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,health care,life sciences,alternative investments,financial services,hedge funds,internet,online,investing,securities,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Stress tests long dreaded by executives at the nation\u2019s largest banks are getting easier.The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will release the final results of this year\u2019s tests, which probe firms\u2019 ability to withstand a severe financial shock. Officials made the tests easier for some banks this year, and for the next time around they are preparing to further change the exams in fundamental ways.The most significant shift would remove a major risk for banks: Failing the tests purely for subjective reasons. The so-called qualitative part of the tests has in past years created embarrassing failures for firms such as             Citigroup Inc.,       Deutsche Bank AG, and             Banco Santander SA        SAN -1.06%      .Fed officials now envision a system where firms would generally only fail the test if their capital levels dipped below the level the Fed views as healthy\u2014in other words for quantitative reasons, not qualitative ones.That likely means fewer test failures. Between 2014 and 2016, the Fed gave banks a failing grade nine times. Only once did a bank fail because of a low capital ratio:             Zions Bancorp.       in 2014.The tests will continue to matter to investors. The Fed will still use them to audit banks\u2019 plans to boost dividends and buybacks for shareholders, and the numerical part of the exams will still be crucial to determining those payouts.Nevertheless, a reduced emphasis on the subjective aspects of the exams could make the tests far less tense for bankers.\u201cThe qualitative [part of the tests] is a lot of process work,\u201d       William Demchak,        chief executive of             PNC Financial Services Group Inc.,       said in a June interview.He said the risk committee of the bank\u2019s board of directors discusses aspects of the exams at each regular meeting, even though sometimes \u201cthere is no reason to\u201d do so because there haven\u2019t been significant changes to the firm\u2019s program. \u201cBut we do, to prove [to the Fed] we have a quality review.\u201dPNC has never failed the tests.The idea of a bank supervisor publicly calling out a bank\u2019s failings has always made some policy makers nervous. After all, one of supervisors\u2019 primary jobs is to prevent damaging \u201cruns\u201d that occur when the public loses confidence in banks and withdraws deposits en masse. If regulators have problems with bankers, they almost always address them privately.Former Fed governor       Daniel Tarullo,        who helped build the tests while serving as the Fed\u2019s regulatory point man between 2009 and earlier this year, has said the Fed departed from a tradition of privacy in part because he and other officials were \u201cstunned\u201d during the financial crisis at what they viewed as banks\u2019 inability to quickly assess the risks they faced.They created an annual stress test with two main parts. One judges whether banks\u2019 plans for paying out capital to shareholders would still allow them to withstand a hypothetical economic downturn. The other part is a \u201cqualitative\u201d evaluation of how they manage risks. If a bank fails either part, the Fed discloses they have failed the tests and reject their requests for higher payouts.\u201cThe potential for embarrassing, public\u201d stress-test failures \u201cwas intended to, and has, focused the minds of banks\u2019 senior management on their capital positions and capital planning processes,\u201d Mr. Tarullo said in an April speech.In 2014, Mr. Tarullo and other senior Fed officials judged Citigroup hadn\u2019t made enough progress in improving risk management. The firm failed the qualitative portion of the tests, and spent about $180 million during the second half of that year to meet the Fed\u2019s expectations. The failure also meant Citigroup couldn\u2019t boost shareholder dividends.Other firms spent tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on the tests to ensure that they didn\u2019t end up in Citigroup\u2019s spot.In 2017 Fed officials changed the rules. For 21 of 34 big banks, the qualitative part of the tests would no longer be a basis for failure. The 21 firms\u2014those with less than $250 billion in total assets and less than $75 billion in assets in nonbank businesses\u2014could still face a reprimand from the Fed, but that would happen privately as part of the Fed\u2019s year-round, ongoing oversight.In proposing the rule change, the Fed cited \u201cthe high public profile\u201d of the tests and the risk that \u201cnoncomplex firms will overinvest in stress testing,\u201d even though they pose less risk to the financial system than larger, more complex peers.The change means those 21 firms are breathing easier ahead of Wednesday\u2019s results.Mr. Tarullo also said in April \u201cthe time may be coming\u201d to remove the qualitative portion of the tests for all firms, even large, complex ones such as Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.,             Bank of America Corp.      , and             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Fed governor       Jerome Powell,        serving in Mr. Tarullo\u2019s role until President       Donald Trump       nominates a Fed vice chairman in charge of bank rules, supported the same idea in Senate testimony Thursday.\u201cMany of our largest banking firms have made substantial progress toward meeting supervisory expectations,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIf that progress continues, I believe it will be appropriate to consider removing the qualitative [part of the tests] for those firms that achieve and sustain high-quality capital planning capabilities.\u201dWrite to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Banking Stress Tests Less Stressful.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bankers-have-less-to-fear-from-stress-tests-1498388406", "news_title": "Bankers Have Less to Fear From \u2018Stress Tests\u2019 ", "keywords": "banking stress tests,bank stress tests,fed stress tests,financial regulation,finreg,stress tests,Banco Santander S.A.,SAN,Federal Reserve,Deutsche Bank,XE:DBK,JPMorgan Chase &,PNC Financial Services Group,PNC,Citigroup,C,Zions Bancorp.,J.P.

Last year, the U.K. voted in a referendum to exit from the European Union.This comes amid concerns that workers in major economies aren\u2019t seeing the benefits of globalization at a time when wages are weak and economic anxiety high.Rising protectionist sentiments \u201chave been part of a broader social and political backlash against globalization,\u201d the BIS said. \u201cInvestment would be the first casualty, given its tight link with trade.\u201dSince the last BIS report one year ago, some central banks have slowly begun to scale back the massive stimulus they injected into their economies in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. On June 14, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates to a range of 1% to 1.25%, continuing a tightening cycle that started in December 2015.Earlier this year, the European Central Bank begun scaling back the size of its quantitative-easing program to \u20ac60 billion ($67 billion) a month from \u20ac80 billion, though it continues to set negative rates on bank deposits stored at the central bank.The Bank of Japan has maintained its aggressive monetary easing, including negative interest rates and asset purchases, and the Bank of England last summer cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25% from 0.5%.These ultraloose monetary policies at are somewhat at odds with a global economy that continues to expand, albeit at a slower pace than in previous recoveries. The threat of deflation has receded, with inflation rates getting closer to the 2% level that many central bankers deem optimal. Unemployment is low in many economies.The BIS, which has for years warned of the potentially dangerous side effects of keeping interest rates too low for too long, also took aim at the recent euphoria in financial markets. It noted that while measures of market volatility are quite low, political uncertainty is elevated.It said that a \u201crisky trinity\u201d of high debt, low productivity and limited room for policy makers to act\u2014which the BIS warned about one year ago\u2014remains.\u201cThe hard data have improved, but not as much as sentiment has,\u201d Mr. Borio said. \u201cOne may legitimately ask whether sentiment has swung too far.\u201dWrite to Brian Blackstone at brian.blackstone@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-25 06:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-for-international-settlements-takes-aim-at-protectionism-1498386606", "news_title": "Bank for International Settlements Takes Aim at Protectionism", "keywords": " bank for international settlements,bis, donald trump, globalization, protectionism, trump,Bank for International Settlements,Claudio Borio,monetary policy,economic news,political,general news,society,community,international relations,globalization,global,world issues,politics,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "A Hong Kong-based private-equity fund co-founded by one of China\u2019s best-known investment bankers is making its first acquisition in the U.S., in a deal that shows China\u2019s continued appetite for overseas assets despite recent hurdles.AGIC Capital, a $1 billion fund co-founded in 2015 by veteran China banker       Henry Cai,        said it would acquire The Ritedose Corporation, a Columbia, S.C.-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, from U.S. private-equity firm Olympus Partners in a deal worth between $600 million and $800 million, including debt. Chinese pharmaceutical company Humanwell Healthcare (Group) Co. will take a minority position, AGIC said.The deal could be announced as soon as Monday.The deal marks an expansion to the U.S. in investments for AGIC, whose chairman, Mr. Cai, became known for arranging some of the first listings of private Chinese companies in Hong Kong, including         Tsingtao Brewery Co.       in 1993. Mr. Cai previously worked at Deutsche Bank AG and UBS Group AG and founded AGIC with partners in Germany. He initially aimed the fund at investments in European companies. AGIC looks for smaller or midsize companies with technology that could be helpful for Chinese industry.AGIC, which counts Chinese sovereign-wealth fund China Investment Corp. as an investor, was part of a consortium including China National Chemical Corp. that agreed last year to buy Germany\u2019s KraussMaffei Group, a maker of equipment that processes plastics and rubber, for $1 billion.AGIC\u2019s planned purchase of Ritedose follows stricter scrutiny of China\u2019s overseas deals by the country\u2019s regulators, who are trying to curb runaway debt levels and keep money from flowing out of the mainland. Chinese regulators late last year tightened rules on the sorts of deals that can get done, and earlier this month asked commercial banks to review loans made to a handful of particularly aggressive conglomerates, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.Chinese outbound acquisitions have fallen this year from last year\u2019s record levels.Sam Sun,        AGIC\u2019s head of greater China, said he believes the Ritedose purchase will get Chinese regulatory approval because it is strategic and the amount of onshore cash involved \u201cis not that significant.\u201dThe deal will be funded by a mixture of debt and equity, with debt financing from a U.S. lender and equity largely in U.S. dollars, with a small portion from cash from mainland China, Mr. Sun said.Ritedose specializes in a manufacturing process for liquid-filled containers that is known for lessening the likelihood of accidental contamination. The demand for such technology is increasing in China and Japan, Mr. Sun said.Ritedose \u201cis a market leader in the U.S. and hasn\u2019t done much in Asia at all,\u201d Mr. Sun said. \u201cWe feel this is the right point that they can expand their presence.\u201dAGIC\u2019s investment will help Ritedose put money in new product development and increase capacity,       Umesh Dalvi,        Ritedose\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a press statement.AGIC plans to begin raising money in 2018 for its next fund, Mr. Sun said, and is targeting between $2 billion and $3 billion.Asia has had a resurgence in private-equity activity recently.         Morgan Stanley               is planning to launch a $2 billion Asia-focused fund in the next few months, while Hong Kong-based All-Stars Investment Ltd. is seeking to raise $800 million for a new fund aimed at late-stage Chinese technology startups, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.Write to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Asian Fund Does First U.S. Buy.'", "news_time": "2017-06-25 05:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/henry-cais-agic-capital-to-buy-pharma-firm-in-first-u-s-push-1498381384", "news_title": "Henry Cai\u2019s AGIC Capital to Buy Pharma Firm in First U.S. Push", "keywords": " china currency,china deals, china foreign deals, china outflow, u.s. currency, u.s. deals, u.s. pharmaceuticals,Olympus Partners,Tsingtao Brewery Co.
