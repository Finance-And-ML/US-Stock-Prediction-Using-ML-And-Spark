The Kremlin has denied the allegations.Chief of staff Reince Priebus may be among those at risk if Congress is unable to pass a health overhaul by the August recess, according to several senior aides.\u201cUltimately, the buck stops at the top,\u201d said one White House official, referring to the president. Asked about the possibility that Mr. Priebus could be dismissed, the person said: \u201cWe\u2019re in a perpetual state of adjustment. We\u2019re always looking for ways to improve. Sometimes that\u2019s process, sometimes that\u2019s personnel; but more importantly, it\u2019s about moving the president\u2019s agenda forward.\u201dInvestigations by the FBI and Congress into Russia\u2019s possible coordination with members of Mr.\u00a0Trump\u2019s team are occupying the president\u2019s focus more than ever, officials say, and without a big legislative achievement soon or significant win to calm his nerves, they say the president could take action to dramatically shuffle his White House team. Mr. Trump has denied his campaign coordinated with Russian officials.Mr. Priebus returned early from last month\u2019s foreign trip along with senior adviser Steve Bannon to begin a broader revamping of White House strategy. The administration is now promoting a weekly theme\u2014June has seen \u201cInfrastructure Week\u201d followed by \u201cWorkforce Development Week\u201d\u2014in an effort to push a more consistent message. Mr.\u00a0Trump\u00a0has been holding news conferences with foreign leaders, business roundtables and public events focused on those weekly policy areas.\u201cReince is trying to pull it all together, but the strategies for the week are a Band-Aid,\u201d said one longtime GOP lobbyist who is close to Mr. Priebus.The Senate, which has been drafting its health-care bill behind closed doors, is\u00a0planning to vote on its measure next week. It is believed to diverge in significant ways from a\u00a0House version that passed in May, and those differences must be ironed out within weeks if Congress is going to meet the August deadline set by the White House.For several months, friends outside the administration say, the president has spoken to them about potential successors for Mr. Priebus. But two other senior administration officials this week asserted that the chief of staff faced more pressure as the American Health Care Act was moving through the House than he does now with it nearing a possible vote in the Senate. They attribute rumblings about Mr. Priebus\u2019s job security to those eager to install another person in his place.Mr.\u00a0Trump\u00a0continues to privately express his frustration with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy,       Rod Rosenstein,        who appointed special counsel Robert Mueller to head the Russia probe, and has at least given voice to the idea of shaking up the Justice Department, according to people who have talked with the president.He also has discussed trying to fire\u00a0Mr. Mueller with friends outside the White House and senior aides of different minds on the issue, these aides said.\u201cI think they have to take Mueller as a life-and-death problem,\u201d said       Newt Gingrich,        the former House speaker and an ally of Mr. Trump who has advised the president against firing the special counsel. \u201cThey have to win this fight in the court of public opinion.\u201dMr. Bannon, however, appears to be most in tune with the president\u2019s own feelings on the matter, one administration official said, adding that Mr. Bannon \u201cis the one coming up with ideas on how to respond to things.\u201dJared Kushner,        the president\u2019s son-in-law and a top adviser,\u00a0supported Mr.\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0May 9\u00a0firing\u00a0of       James Comey       as FBI director but has \u201cbacked off\u201d on matters related to the Russia probe, the official said. Mr. Kushner, whose actions are being scrutinized by investigators, has hired an attorney. Mr. Kushner\u2019s attorney said he will cooperate with any investigation.Amid the tumult, the president continues to make overtures\u00a0to his former campaign manager,       Corey Lewandowski,        about joining the administration in some capacity.The growing clouds around the administration over the Russia investigations are impeding its ability to recruit talent, according to people inside and outside of the administration. At the same time, the administration has seen several people leave for various reasons. Mike Dubke, the former communications director, resigned last month citing personal reasons but agreed to stay on the job for several weeks to assist with the overwhelming workload.Hiring is \u201cgoing slower than they would like,\u201d one person close to the administration said. \u201cThere\u2019s still just so much drama, and everyone is leaking and counter-leaking because no one is secure in their position. Who would want to work somewhere like that?\u201dPress secretary Sean Spicer,\u00a0who is now splitting time in the briefing room with his deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, acknowledged this week that the administration is trying to lure a new person to take over at the podium.Behind the scenes, conversations about potential replacements have been another point of contention for top advisers.According to two administration officials, they were especially at odds over the suggestion of hiring David Martosko, a Daily Mail reporter close to the administration and favored by Mr.\u00a0Kushner but not taken seriously by other top aides, who cited his lack of experience in front of the camera.Kimberly Guilfoyle of Fox News had been at the top of Mr.\u00a0Trump\u2019s wish list but just negotiated a contract extension by using the White House\u2019s interest as leverage, people close to the Fox personality confirmed.Conservative radio host Laura Ingraham remains a possibility, several people said.

After Mexican leaders pushed back against the idea, the president-elect backtracked in January, suggesting the U.S. would pay upfront for the wall and Mexico would return the money later.But Congress hasn\u2019t allocated funds for the project, and opposition from Democratic and some Republican lawmakers has left the wall\u2019s future in doubt. It remains unclear whether the barrier will be built at all.\u201cThis way, Mexico will have to pay much less money, and that\u2019s good,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the rally. \u201cA solar wall.

It also means Argentina may find it harder to meet a 3.5% annual growth target included in its 2017 budget.\u201cThe economy is going from one that was clearly a pro-consumption-based model to one that is investment driven,\u201d said Rodrigo \u00c1lvarez, director of Analytica Consultora, an economic research firm.\u201cThe challenge for the government is to ensure that investment boosts growth at a time when consumption is not gaining traction,\u201d Mr. \u00c1lvarez said.The economy grew 1.1% from the fourth quarter of 2016.After taking office in December 2015, President Macri replaced the policies of his populist predecessor,       Cristina Kirchner,        with market-friendly measures to induce investment. Argentina\u2019s economy stalled during Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s second term and per capita output is now 6% lower than it was half a decade ago, Mr. \u00c1lvarez said.Executives have hailed Mr. Macri\u2019s policies, including tax cuts and deregulation, and sectors such as agriculture and banking benefited immediately from the elimination of currency controls.Farmers have been investing more in everything from trucks to cattle and fertilizer equipment. Argentina is looking at a record harvest and some rural areas are growing quickly. But in other sectors investors have remained on the sidelines, saying they prefer to wait it out and see if Mrs. Kirchner or her policies could make a comeback in a midterm election in October.Earlier this week, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index postponed a decision to include Argentina in its emerging market stocks category. The MSCI said Argentina meets most of the criteria needed to appear in the index but that it is unclear if Mr. Macri\u2019s policies will stand the test of time.Retail sales have declined almost constantly since Mr. Macri took power as consumers safeguard their cash to pay for higher gas, electricity, water and transportation prices. Economists say higher utility rates, approved by Mr. Macri, have boosted investment in such services, but consumers and small-business owners are wondering when they too will benefit.On Monday, Mrs. Kirchner held a large political rally, surrounding herself with people who she said were struggling to make ends meet. She hinted that she may run for Congress in October\u2019s election.Mr. \u00c1lvarez says investors are pouring money into oil, gas and renewable energy. Meanwhile, the government is increasing spending on roads, bridges and airports, and a new home mortgage system is leading to increased construction.But car makers and other manufacturers are struggling to increase output amid weak demand from Brazil, Argentina\u2019s top trade partner.Mr. \u00c1lvarez expects the economy to grow between 2.7% and 3% this year, led by a robust turnaround in farming, construction and transportation. A recent survey of analysts by FocusEconomics put growth at 2.6%. Economists also expect the annual inflation rate to decline to close to 21% from about 37% last year.Foreign investment could pick up this year and next if Mr. Macri\u2019s Pro party does well in the October election. A decelerating inflation rate should also help boost consumer spending as companies raise salaries during annual collective bargaining agreements.\u201cEconomic growth wasn\u2019t brilliant in the first quarter, but if you keep in mind what\u2019s happening in Brazil and the negative legacy of the previous government, then growth doesn\u2019t look all that bad,\u201d Mr. \u00c1lvarez said.Write to Taos Turner at taos.turner@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 20:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/argentinas-economy-expanded-0-3-in-first-quarter-1498092366", "news_title": "Argentina\u2019s Economy Expanded 0.3% in First Quarter ", "keywords": "economy,inflation,macri,pro party,taxes,Mauricio Macri,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,prices,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Senate Republicans\u2019 plan to pass legislation next week to overhaul the health-care system hung in the balance Wednesday, as at least a half-dozen GOP lawmakers wavered and balked at the push for a quick vote.The opposition is coming both from conservative Republican senators, who believe the proposal doesn\u2019t repeal enough of the Affordable Care Act, as well as GOP centrists, who are balking at steep cuts to Medicaid that would leave more people uninsured. The situation is fluid and could change, but the political double bind leaves GOP leaders with little room to maneuver.Lawmakers on both ends of the GOP spectrum are also increasingly joining Democrats in criticizing the lack of transparency and rapid-fire timeline for a vote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) plans to release draft legislation Thursday morning; many lawmakers said they hadn\u2019t seen the bill\u2019s text as of Wednesday afternoon.Some Republicans, including Sen.       Ron Johnson       (R., Wis.), are calling the timetable too rushed to ensure their support.\u201cI would find it hard to believe I will have enough time,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019ve made leadership well aware of the fact that I need information to make a final decision, and if I don\u2019t have the information to justify a yes vote, I won\u2019t be voting yes.\u201dAt least 50 of the chamber\u2019s 52 Republicans must back the legislation for it to pass because no Democrats are expected to vote for it. If the chamber splits 50-50, Vice President       Mike Pence       would cast the tiebreaking vote.The Senate deliberations are taking on an added urgency as some insurers said they would withdraw from the health law\u2019s marketplaces next year.Anthem Inc. said Wednesday it would exit the marketplaces in Wisconsin and Indiana, while nonprofit MDwise said it would leave the Indiana exchange. Those moves may leave four Indiana counties at risk of having no exchange insurers in 2018, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on health care. But foundation researchers cautioned the outlook remains unclear.Senators said they expect an estimate of the bill\u2019s cost and coverage impact from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office by Monday at the latest.The bill seeks to deliver on a Republican campaign promise to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and replace it with a system conservatives said would be more effective. GOP leaders haven\u2019t publicly disclosed the bill\u2019s contents, but it is expected to include deep cuts to Medicaid and a freeze of the program\u2019s expansion under the 2010 health law.Under the Senate version, people without employer-provided insurance could qualify for subsidies that would be based on income, age and health costs in their area, people familiar with the discussions said. It could also lower the income eligibility for subsidies, meaning fewer people would likely be eligible than under the law now. It also will likely diverge from the House bill by keeping some insurance regulations, although states could likely roll them back using federal waivers.Senate GOP leaders have included provisions likely to land support from conservatives, people familiar with the discussions said, including a slower growth rate for Medicaid spending, starting in 2025, as compared with the House version.Still, a number of conservative GOP senators expressed frustration and reservations on Wednesday.\u201cI promised voters I would vote to repeal Obamacare, and everything I hear sounds like Obamacare lite,\u201d said Sen.       Rand Paul       (R., Ky.), coming out of a Senate GOP lunch where details of the bill were discussed.At least four Republican senators\u2014      Mike Lee       of Utah,       Tom Cotton       of Arkansas,       Ted Cruz       of Texas and Mr. Paul\u2014already believe conservatives made significant concessions in the House bill. A Senate bill in which conservatives are likely to lose more ground would likely be unacceptable, one conservative strategist said.Beyond the substance, several senators said they were frustrated because they would apparently have a week to review the bill before leadership asks for a vote, raising the possibility that the vote could be pushed into July.\u201cThe whole process is not satisfactory,\u201d Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.) said. \u201cI feel terrible about it.\u201dMr. Lee, who hosted a             Facebook                   live event Tuesday, said he hasn\u2019t seen the bill even though he is a member of a Senate GOP working group charged with crafting it.\u201cIt\u2019s not being written by us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s apparently been written by a small handful of staffers in the Republican leadership in the Senate.\u201dCentrist GOP senators, meanwhile, said they would be concerned if the bill includes overly sharp spending reductions to Medicaid. The bill is expected to begin a cutoff of federal funding for new enrollees under the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion in three years, starting in 2021, one year later than the House bill, though the provision could change.Republicans senators, including       Rob Portman       of Ohio and       Susan Collins       of Maine, had hoped for a longer delay on Medicaid. They also had hoped to see $45 billion in funding for treating opioid addiction in the legislation, and several people close to the drafting of the bill said that isn\u2019t currently included.Some lawmakers said it wasn\u2019t clear whether the bill would include a provision that would effectively defund Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Ms. Collins said if the bill included that measure, she and Sen.       Lisa Murkowski       (R., Alaska) would offer an amendment reversing it.Senate Democrats criticized the Republicans\u2019 closed process for crafting the bill and the substance of the legislation.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a bunch of privileged members of Congress that get government health insurance from taxpayers and they are meeting behind closed doors to find a way to take insurance from a lot of families where the parents are working,\u201d Sen.       Sherrod Brown       (D., Ohio) said. \u201cIt\u2019s just morally reprehensible.\u201dRepublican senators\u2019 frustration is arising in part because both conservative and centrist Republicans believe they are on the losing end of the weekslong talks.Conservative observers feel the centrists prevailed in several of the tug-of-wars, including the battles over Medicaid and insurance regulations, according to lawmakers, strategists and lobbyists. At the same time, centrists dispute that the Medicaid arrangements are sufficient to meet the needs of their states.To sway conservatives, Mr. McConnell has been telling them that Democrats could wind up working with centrist Republican Senators to draft a less conservative health bill if they fail to support the GOP legislation, a strategist close to the Republican leadership said.The strength of the market is waning as insurers pull out of the marketplace. And that is underlining the importance of whether the health bill will include billions of dollars in funding for market stabilization, as well as an appropriation for the law\u2019s \u201ccost-sharing reduction\u201d payments to insurers, which help them offset subsidies to low-income consumers. Insurers have feared the abrupt cutoff of the cost-sharing payments.An appropriation for those payments was expected to be in the bill, a senior administration official and GOP strategists said, but by Wednesday evening it wasn\u2019t certain it would withstand procedural challenges. Other sources said the funding would be pursued in the fall when Congress votes to reauthorize funding for Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program or in stand-alone legislation that would need to be passed by the chamber.The funding is especially attractive to centrist GOP senators hailing from states with especially fragile markets, and could become the basis of any Democratic bill seeking to supplant a GOP move.\u2014Michelle Hackman contributed to this article.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com, Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Sen.

She testified with DHS and Federal Bureau of Investigation officials on Wednesday morning.Her admission was the first time a government official had publicly quantified the number of states targeted in the hacking. Officials said there was no evidence that systems involved in vote tallying or reporting were affected.Ms. Manfra didn\u2019t name the 21 states in question\u2014citing the privacy rights of entities that contacted the DHS for help on cybersecurity-related issues. Only a few states\u2014including Arizona and Illinois\u2014have publicly acknowledged that their systems were targeted.The hearings were held after the U.S. intelligence community in January determined that Moscow ran a campaign designed to help       Donald Trump       win the presidential election. The Russian campaign, according to U.S. intelligence officials, included cyberattacks on the email accounts of senior Democrats and a propaganda effort aimed at demonizing Democratic candidate       Hillary Clinton.The White House has said the Trump campaign didn\u2019t collude with any alleged Russian meddling.\u201cI think the primary goal was to sow discord and to try to delegitimize our free and fair election process,\u201d Bill Priestap, assistant director of the Counterintelligence Division at the FBI, told the Senate panel about the Russian influence campaign. Moscow\u2019s secondary purpose was to \u201cdenigrate\u201d Mrs. Clinton and boost Mr. Trump, the Republican candidate, he said.In a separate hearing in front of the House panel, Mr. Johnson said the Obama administration had been reluctant to alert the public to the Russian hacking efforts last year because officials wanted to avoid the appearance of taking sides in what was a hard-fought election. He also acknowledged that the government was slow to respond to the threat and was hampered at times by poor communications among agencies.Mr. Johnson testified that there was a monthslong delay in 2016 from when the FBI learned of the DNC hack to when he was alerted as head of DHS, a separate agency. \u201cI was not very happy to be learning about it some months later,\u201d he said.Mr. Johnson also said that he and then-FBI Director       James Comey       \u201cworked very well together,\u201d but that there \u201cwere glitches\u201d in communication. \u201cThere were instances when we didn\u2019t communicate as well as we should have.\u201dA representative for the FBI declined to comment.Mr. Johnson also said the warnings last year from the intelligence community that it was \u201cconfident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations,\u201d was reduced to \u201cbelow the fold\u201d news by the emergence that day of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape featuring past lewd remarks by Mr. Trump.Officials said that most of the cyber-activities consisted of scans for known vulnerabilities in election systems unrelated to vote-tallying\u2014activity \u201canalogous to somebody walking down the street and looking to see if you are home,\u201d said       Samuel Liles,        acting director of the Cyber Division in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at DHS.But Mr. Liles told the Senate panel that a \u201csmall number\u201d of systems were successfully penetrated. Officials didn\u2019t elaborate on which kind of systems were successfully breached other than to say that there was no indication that vote tallies were changed or improperly recorded. Much of the data targeted was voter-registration information.Asked how U.S. agencies could gird against similar intrusion attempts in coming elections, Mr. Johnson suggested Congress consider grants to state election officials to \u201chelp them harden their cybersecurity and raise awareness of the evils and hazards of spear-phishing.\u201d Spear-phising is a tactic in which hackers pose as associates in an effort to trick people into giving up sensitive information such as network usernames and passwords.Mr. Johnson said that states have resisted what they see as federal intrusion into elections, and as a result might be best served by such grants.He said the Democratic National Committee, which had a trove of emails stolen and published on WikiLeaks, and several states rejected DHS\u2019s offer of assistance last summer. Mr. Johnson said he was told by his staff that the DNC didn\u2019t think it it needed DHS\u2019s assistance at the time.\u201cThe DNC was contacted by DHS months after the DNC worked closely with the FBI to remedy the intrusion. The DNC then provided DHS with detailed information about the intrusion,\u201d said Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the DNC.After the election, DHS designated election systems as \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d which increased the resources that federal officials could devote to protecting the systems.\u201cIn retrospect, it would be easy for me to say that I should have bought a sleeping bag and camped out in front of the DNC,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.States are also examining their own systems. A survey by The Wall Street Journal of election officials in nearly 50 states found many continue to participate in a DHS program of periodic checks of their election systems for any vulnerabilities.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com and Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'Russia Tried To Hack Vote In 21 States.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 19:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-hacking-hearings-to-focus-on-state-level-1498037401", "news_title": "Russia Targeted 21 States for Election Hacking, Official Says ", "keywords": "2016 election,dhs,house hearing,russia,russia hacking,russia probe,senate hearing,trump,Federal Bureau of Investigation,Department of Homeland Security,The Senate,Vladimir Putin,Donald Trump,Jeanette Manfra,Jeh Johnson,political,general news,crime,legal action,cybercrime,hacking,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,department of homeland security,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Law-enforcement agencies are investigating the stabbing of a police officer at Bishop International Airport in Flint, Mich., on Wednesday morning as an act of terrorism.The alleged attacker was identified as 50-year-old       Amor Ftouhi,        a Canadian citizen who entered the U.S. legally on June 16. Mr. Ftouhi stabbed an airport police officer in the neck before being subdued by officers including the victim, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.David Gelios,        the FBI agent in charge of the investigation, said Mr. Ftouhi dropped the bags he was carrying, pulled out a knife and yelled \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d meaning \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic, before stabbing Lt.

Defense minister       Sylvie Goulard       and European affairs minister       Marielle de Sarnez      \u2014both members of MoDem\u2014were also left out of the new government.The ministers said they chose to leave after French prosecutors on June 9 launched a preliminary probe into allegations MoDem lawmakers at the European Parliament wrongfully used European funds to employ people working for the party as parliamentary assistants.MoDem has denied any wrongdoing.Mr. Bayrou\u2019s departure deprives Mr. Macron of a senior figure of French politics who rallied centrist voters to his successful election campaign.Mr. Bayrou backed Mr. Macron in February, saluting the presidential candidate\u2019s promise to clean up politics after a series of expense scandals dogged rivals in the presidential race.At the time, Mr. Bayrou\u2019s support boosted Mr. Macron\u2019s poll numbers, securing his position as front-runner in the presidential election.After winning the presidential election in May, the backing of MoDem gave Mr. Macron an experienced party apparatus as he scrambled to recruit candidates for legislative elections.But Mr. Macron\u2019s party La R\u00e9publique En Marche, made up mainly of political neophytes, defied early expectations by winning an outright majority in the election. With 308 of the 577 seats in the National Assembly after the second and final round of voting Sunday, Mr. Macron doesn\u2019t need the support of MoDem, which won 42 seats.Mr. Bayrou, who as justice minister was preparing a new law for the moral improvement of politics, said he chose not to be part of the new government to recover his freedom of speech and better defend his party against the allegations.\u201cI am choosing to not expose the government and the president to a deceitful campaign,\u201d Mr. Bayrou said.Mr. Macron replaced the departing MoDem ministers with more technocratic, less political castings.       Nicole Belloubet,        a member of France\u2019s constitutional council was appointed justice minister and       Nathalie Loiseau,        director of France\u2019s elite training school \u00c9cole nationale d\u2019administration, became European affairs minister.In a nod to moderate leftists who backed his campaign, Mr. Macron picked Florence Parly\u2014a budget minister in the Socialist government of       Lionel Jospin      \u2014as defense minister.Some analysts say that by sidelining MoDem from his government, Mr. Macron is showing a tough approach to political scandals that strengthens his position as he prepares a contentious new labor law.\u201cThe departure of Francois Bayrou will eliminate a potential element of discord in the cabinet and strengthen the president\u2019s hold on his government,\u201d said       Antonio Barroso,        analyst at political risk consultancy Teneo Intelligence.Mr. Bayrou said that MoDem will still be part of Mr. Macron\u2019s majority in parliament. Two members of his party were handed junior posts in the new government.\u201cWe and I stand by the president of the Republic, to help and support him,\u201d Mr. Bayrou said.Mr. Macron\u2019s backing in parliament was also strengthened Wednesday when some lawmakers from the main opposition party Les R\u00e9publicains split off into a separate group with another centrist party. The block says it will be \u201cconstructive\u201d by supporting Mr. Macron\u2019s government on key texts.Lawmakers will finally draw lines in the sand July 4 when the National Assembly holds a vote of confidence in Mr. Macron\u2019s government.Write to William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche won 308 seats in the legislative election on Sunday.

But the political sands are shifting, and the change will accelerate with Wednesday\u2019s appointment of       Mohammed bin Salman       as Crown Prince.King Salman broke with decades of tradition with his royal decree that ousted his nephew, security czar       Mohammed bin Nayef,        in favor of Salman\u2019s son, Mohammed bin Salman. The Saudi crown has typically passed from one octogenarian or septuagenarian brother to another, so the rise of the 31-year-old son as heir designate is a monumental development.This is all the more remarkable given the young leader\u2019s reformist inclinations. The Saudis face a triple challenge in falling oil prices, a youth demographic bulge and Iranian imperialism. The Crown Prince believes the answer is an assertive foreign policy that unites Sunni Arab states against Tehran, combined with domestic reform that weans the Kingdom off oil.This regional vision took shape soon after King Salman ascended the throne in 2015. As Defense Minister (a portfolio he will retain), the Crown Prince emerged as the architect of the Saudi-led military campaign to oust the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen.The Yemen operation has been long and hard, but it has largely succeeded in cutting off Iranian supplies to the Houthis and boosted the confidence of Arab states. Mohammed bin Salman has also spearheaded efforts to diplomatically isolate Qatar over its two-faced policy of cooperating with the West while funding Islamist groups like Hamas.Last year the Crown Prince launched Vision 2030, a reform program to diversify the Saudi economy and expand the role of private enterprise. The heart of the plan is to boost the private share of the economy to 65% by 2030 from about 40%, and reduce the government\u2019s dependence on oil for revenues, now at 70%.That\u2019s a tall order in a Kingdom that has historically offered its citizens oil-funded, cradle-to-grave welfare in exchange for little say in politics. Many Saudis have grown up to expect high-paying government jobs that are increasingly hard to subsidize with oil at under $50 a barrel. Unleashing the private economy will also require liberating Saudi women to enter the work force\u2014the right to drive would be a start\u2014and that has already triggered clashes with the Wahhabi clerical establishment.Earlier this year the government was forced to reverse a pay cut for state employees. Yet Mohammed bin Salman has made progress in other areas. A plan to offer public shares in the state-run oil company, Aramco, is moving ahead. Concerts are performed and movie theaters are opening for the first time in the Kingdom, allowing young Saudis access to entertainment and social interaction that their peers nearly everywhere else take for granted.His appointment as Crown Prince will strengthen his hand by putting to rest competing claims to the throne from more conservative corners of the House of Saud with its 7,000 princes. A moderate and prosperous Saudi Arabia would bolster stability across the Arab world and is squarely in the U.S. national interest. Washington should support and encourage the young prince as he pursues change.Appeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-21 19:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/change-in-the-house-of-saud-1498086487", "news_title": "Change in the House of Saud", "keywords": "Mohammed bin Salman,editorials"}, {"content": "The horrific death of       Otto Warmbier,        a 22-year-old student held in a North Korean prison for 17 months, highlights the brutal nature of the rogue regime and underscores the urgency of stopping its nuclear ambitions. The next step should be to sanction the Chinese financiers and traders who sustain       Kim Jong Un.President Trump built up expectations of Chinese help after his April summit with President       Xi Jinping.       That was a long shot given China\u2019s failure to rein in its ally in the past. But it made sense diplomatically, putting Mr. Xi on notice that tougher U.S. action would follow if he failed to deliver. But on Tuesday Mr. Trump tweeted, \u201cWhile I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!\u201dAs the Journal reported last week, the Administration asked Beijing to crack down on some 10 Chinese companies and individuals that trade with North Korea. If China refuses, the U.S. is prepared to act unilaterally by the end of the summer. The U.S. should now move with dispatch to use tougher sanctions to deprive those on the list from access to the international financial system.Skeptics are right that United Nations sanctions have done little to stop North Korea, but the sanctions that drove Iran to the negotiating table were far tougher. And a new report from the Washington research group C4ADS suggests that the North\u2019s trading network is highly vulnerable to the new sanctions.The report dispels the misconception that North Korea obtains materials and technology for its weapons through an invisible network that can\u2019t be stopped by sanctions. It says the same small number of Chinese individuals and companies that dominate legal trade with the North also supply it with \u201cdual use\u201d goods to build nukes and missiles. As sanctions have tightened, this network has grown smaller and more consolidated. That\u2019s because there are only a few individuals who have the skills and connections within China and North Korea to continue trade under these circumstances. Pyongyang will find it hard to replace them.The U.S. stumbled across this North Korean vulnerability in September 2005 when the U.S. Treasury named Macau\u2019s Banco Delta Asia a \u201cprimary concern\u201d for North Korean money laundering. The bank was forced to freeze $25 million in North Korean assets, but the knock-on effects were huge. Trade that depended on the bank ground to a halt, and other banks cut their business with North Korea.In a tragic miscalculation, the Bush Administration released the frozen funds two years later in return for North Korea returning to disarmament talks, which went nowhere. North Korea moved most of its trading network to China, and the Obama Administration let the North Korea problem grow as it focused on other priorities.North Korea is now a few years away from fielding an intercontinental missile, and U.S. options are dwindling. A pre-emptive military strike is the last resort because the Kim regime could kill millions with conventional and nuclear weapons. But now that Beijing has been given the chance to help and either refused or failed, the U.S. and its allies have to use every sanction and other tool available to prevent the Kim regime from doing to millions what it did to Otto Warmbier.Appeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-21 19:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-step-on-north-korea-1498086339", "news_title": "The Next Step on North Korea", "keywords": " kim jong un, missile defense,north korea, otto warmbier, sanctions, torture,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,editorials"}, {"content": "Democrats thought they could pick up a GOP-leaning House seat by turning Tuesday\u2019s special election in Georgia\u2019s sixth congressional district into a referendum on the       Trump       Presidency. The lesson of the GOP\u2019s four-percentage-point victory is that Republicans can preserve their congressional majority despite doubts about Donald Trump\u2014if they deliver on their agenda.Republicans staved off what the press would have portrayed as a catastrophe and portent of a GOP wipeout in next year\u2019s midterm elections. And they did so with a weak candidate in       Karen Handel,        a former Georgia secretary of state who lost bids for Governor in 2010 and U.S. Senate in 2014.Democrats thought they could steal the seat because it is full of the upscale, college-educated Republicans who dislike Mr. Trump. While Health and Human Services Secretary       Tom Price       was re-elected last November by 23 points,       Hillary Clinton       came within two points of beating Mr. Trump. Democrats\u2014who, by the way, favor limits on campaign spending\u2014poured $31 million into the district to turn out liberal voters.Yet Republicans managed to turn out their voters by portraying       Jon Ossoff,        a 30-year-old former congressional aide who doesn\u2019t live in the district, as a foot soldier for       Nancy Pelosi.       Conservative voters showed they aren\u2019t ready to hand the House back to Mrs. Pelosi whatever their doubts about Mr. Trump.One immediate benefit is that the victory might deter some Republican retirements that would create more open seats in 2018 if they fear a Democratic wave. But Democrats are still likely to turn out in big numbers next year. The challenge for Republicans will be to give their voters a reason to match that liberal enthusiasm. That\u2019s all the more reason to put accomplishments on the board that voters can see on health care, taxes and more.As for Democrats, the defeat underlies the contradiction between the total resistance to Mr. Trump needed to win a primary and the centrist coloration needed to flip a GOP-leaning seat in areas like northern Virginia (held by       Barbara Comstock      ) and Upper Hudson Valley New York (      John Faso      ). Mr. Ossoff energized progressives by promising \u201cto make Trump furious.\u201d After the primary he tacked to the middle by running as a fiscal conservative and against tax increases on the rich.But by then Republicans were already defining him as a Pelosi pawn. It didn\u2019t help that so much of his cash came from liberal redoubts like San Francisco or that he was endorsed by       Bernie Sanders.       Some groups on the left like MoveOn.org are now saying that the lesson from Mr. Ossoff\u2019s defeat is that Democrats need to run as pure left-wing populists in 2018.This left-center tension in the Democratic Party is likely to intensify, especially if the GOP racks up some policy victories, which could propel Democrats to nominate candidates who are too far left for the districts they need to win in 2018. But Republicans can\u2019t afford complacency, and their best defense against an anti-Trump wave is legislative success.Appeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-21 19:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-real-georgia-lesson-1498086259", "news_title": "The Real Georgia Lesson", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,elections,national,presidential elections,editorials"}, {"content": "Carl Paladino,        an outspoken Republican who lost his bid to be governor of New York seven years ago, will fight for his seat on the Buffalo school board\u00a0Thursday\u00a0at an unusual hearing in Albany.The hearing is focused on specific charges the board has made against Mr. Paladino but are bringing long-simmering tensions between Mr. Paladino and his critics to the fore.A majority of the nine-person Buffalo board voted earlier this year to ask state Education Commissioner       MaryEllen Elia       to remove Mr. Paladino for allegedly disclosing confidential board information in an article and an email to journalists.Mr. Paladino said in an interview\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0that the information wasn\u2019t confidential and the petition against him is a cover for the board to oust him over other issues. \u201cI\u2019m the guy that exposed the underbelly, corruption, mistakes, and costly actions that are taken by the board,\u201d he said.While the petition is narrowly focused on the alleged disclosure of confidential information, the hearing comes on the heels of controversy.Board members tried and failed to get Mr. Paladino to resign over remarks he made to Buffalo publication Artvoice, though the petition doesn\u2019t ask for his removal over those remarks.Mr. Paladino told the publication in December that his hopes for 2017 were for President       Barack Obama       to die from mad-cow disease, and for       Michelle Obama       to get \u201clet loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla.\u201dMr. Paladino, who served as co-chairman of President       Donald Trump\u2019s       New York campaign, drew protests in Buffalo and widespread condemnation, including from Mr. Trump, in the wake of those comments.Mr. Paladino has said he \u201cmade a mistake\u201d but that he wouldn\u2019t resign from the board.He has sued board members for allegedly violating his first-amendment rights by trying to remove him after his remarks.Frank Miller, an attorney for the board majority, said they wanted the hearing to focus on Mr. Paladino\u2019s alleged disclosure of confidential information. \u201cWe want a clean hearing focused on if he did it, if it was willful, if it was deliberate, and if it caused harm,\u201d Mr. Miller said.But to both Mr. Paladino\u2019s opponents and allies, the hearing is partially a referendum on Mr. Paladino in general.A high-profile real-estate developer, he became the GOP gubernatorial nominee in 2010. His rapid political ascent was linked to the then-burgeoning Tea Party movement, but he lost to Democrat Andrew Cuomo after a heated race.Mr. Paladino has served on the Buffalo School Board since 2013. His clout in New York politics was on the rise after Mr. Trump tapped him to help run his campaign. After Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, Mr. Paladino said he was considering another gubernatorial run.But his comments about Mr. and Mrs. Obama caused a surge of backlash, even for someone who has long drawn strong reactions.\u201cHe\u2019s always been controversial in this town,\u201d said Michael Caputo, a Buffalo-area Republican strategist who worked on Mr. Paladino\u2019s campaign, \u201cbut this was the highest degree of criticism he\u2019s gotten since 2010,\u201d when he ran for governor.Local parents who support Mr. Paladino\u2019s removal have said his remarks about the former president and ensuing public outrage and school board dramas have been a distraction from the work of improving education. The conflict has embroiled a chronically troubled district that has started to make strides, boosting its graduation rate to 64% last year, from 48% in 2012.\u201cIf he had any respect for the position and dignity he would resign,\u201d said       Samuel Radford III,        a Buffalo parent-leader.Mr. Paladino and his allies assert that his critics are opposed to his education-reform ideas that are less union-friendly and are capitalizing on his controversial comments to get rid of him.\u201cThe union quietly orchestrates opposition to Carl with their puppets on the board,\u201d Mr. Caputo said, \u201cand I think that rivalry really motivates him.\u201dJay Worona, general counsel for the state school board association, which is remaining impartial, said it would not be inappropriate for Mr. Paladino\u2019s past remarks to play a role in the hearing, but that the commissioner will make her ruling only on if Mr. Paladino did what he is accused of in the board\u2019s petition.\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t be precluded from saying, \u2018I find those statements reprehensible,\u2019\u201d Mr. Worona said, \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t be the basis of her decision.\u201dWrite to Mike Vilensky at mike.vilensky@dowjones.com and Leslie Brody at leslie.brody@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 19:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/carl-paladino-seeks-to-keep-buffalo-school-board-seat-at-unusual-hearing-1498086293", "news_title": "Carl Paladino Seeks to Keep Buffalo School Board Seat at Unusual Hearing", "keywords": "artvoice,buffalo, buffalo school board,carl paladino, carl paladino artvoice interview, carl paladino hearing, carl paladino obama comments, maryellen elia, state education commissioner elia,Carl Paladino,MaryEllen Elia,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,education,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,school,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Oracle Corp.\u2019s        ORCL 1.09%       stock hasn\u2019t kept pace with some cloud rivals for years as the software company lagged behind in transitioning its business to the cloud.That may have begun to change Wednesday after Oracle reported earnings that topped Wall Street\u2019s modest forecasts, sending the stock up more than 10% in after hours trading.The Redwood City, Calif., company said its fiscal fourth-quarter net rose 15% to $3.23 billion, or 76 a share, from $2.81 billion, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. The company said adjusted per-share earnings, which commonly exclude stock-based compensation and other items, were 89 cents.Revenue rose 2.8% to $10.89 billion.According to estimates gathered by S&P Global Market Intelligence, analysts expected Oracle to earn 78 cents a share on an adjusted basis, on revenue of $10.45 billion.Analysts were particularly impressed with Oracle\u2019s success in bringing in new customers to its web-based, on-demand computing services. Annually recurring revenue, or ARR, from these new customers hit $855 million in the quarter, and topped $2 billion for year, the company said.\u201cIt\u2019s the best quarter we have ever had,\u201d Oracle co-Chief Executive       Mark Hurd       said during a conference call with analysts. \u201cWe had a goal of $2 billion in ARR; we finished with nearly $2.1 billion. Next year, we will sell more.\u201dAt the same time, Oracle is altering the way it reports on its cloud business. The company is mixing its nascent infrastructure-as-a-service business, where it provides computing resources and storage on demand, with its more tenured business of selling access to app-management and data analytics tools, called platform-as-a-service.In its fiscal fourth quarter, Oracle posted solid results in its cloud-infrastructure business, where it competes against leaders             Amazon.com Inc.,        AMZN 0.24%Microsoft Corp.        MSFT 0.76%       and             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s        GOOGL 0.59%       Google. Revenue from the business rose 23% to $208 million.The company\u2019s platform-as-a-service business, combined with its other cloud business that sells access to applications\u2014known as software-as-a-service\u2014saw revenue climb 67% to $1.15 billion ended May 31.On a call with analysts, co-CEO       Safra Catz       said Oracle combined results from its platform and infrastructure cloud businesses because \u201csynergies and cross-selling between these two businesses is very high.\u201dCombining results from the two business will make it harder to measure Oracle\u2019s success in the cloud-infrastructure market.       Larry Ellison,        Oracle\u2019s co-founder and executive chairman, made building the company\u2019s cloud-infrastructure business a key mission, saying last summer \u201cAmazon\u2019s lead is over\u201d after introducing Oracle\u2019s latest technology for the market.Amazon, though, continues to pull away. Its Amazon Web Services unit, whose net sales are largely comprised of its cloud-infrastructure business, grew 43% in the most recent quarter to $3.66 billion.To keep pace with rivals in the cloud-infrastructure market, Oracle will need to meaningfully expand its capital spending and operating expenses, Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback recently wrote in a report.Last year alone, Amazon, Microsoft and Google spent a combined $31.54 billion in 2016 on capital expenditures and leases, much of that on data centers to deliver cloud-infrastructure services.Oracle spent $2.02 billion on capital expenditures in its fiscal year, up from $1.19 billion a year earlier. That, in part, led to operating margins of 34%, compared with 43% in the previous fiscal year. The company has said it doesn\u2019t believe it needs to spend as much as rivals to catch up, arguing its technology is superior.Growth in Oracle\u2019s entire cloud business is outpacing the decline in its legacy business of selling licenses to software customers run on their own servers.The cloud business grew $502 million year-over-year while Oracle\u2019s new software-license revenue fell $140 million. It is the fourth-consecutive quarter in which Oracle\u2019s cloud-revenue gains outpaced declines in its legacy software business.Over all, revenue from new software licenses fell 5% to $2.63 billion.The biggest piece of Oracle\u2019s software business remains its massive software-license updates and product-support operations. That segment generated $4.9 billion in revenue, a 2% gain from a year earlier.Write to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 18:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oracles-cloud-business-lifts-profit-1498077696", "news_title": "Oracle\u2019s Cloud Business Lifts Profit", "keywords": "cloud infrastructure,infrastructure as a service,oracle,oracle earnings,technology,technology company earnings,technology systems,us tech companies,Amazon.com,AMZN,Alphabet Inc.

But other health-care-industry players and experts have said the moves would do little in the U.S. to curb drug costs or increase competition.The content of the order could change, and it is unclear when the White House would even issue the order.President Donald Trump has said drug companies have been \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d by charging so much for medicines, and vowed to take action to make drugs more affordable.Following reports in various media outlets regarding the White House\u2019s plans for a drug-price executive order, two Democrats on the House Oversight committee sent a letter to President Trump asking for the opportunity to provide input.\u201cYour planned executive actions suggest that you have abandoned these promises in favor of the very pharmaceutical lobby you warned of,\u201d Rep.       Elijah Cummings       (D., Md.) and Rep.       Peter Welch       (D., Vt.) wrote.The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group, declined to comment on the letter or reports about the executive order. The White House Office of Management and Budget didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.High prices for drugs like Mylan NV\u2019s EpiPen allergic-reaction treatment, Turing Pharmaceuticals AG\u2019s anti-parasite drug Daraprim and heart drugs whose prices rose by triple-digit percentages after being bought by             Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.       have been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats and been the subject of congressional hearings, most recently by the Senate\u2019s health committee last week.The White House, in putting together the executive order, has considered proposals that would fulfill drug-industry aims for removing regulations companies consider outdated or burdensome, cut the cost of drug testing and strengthen patent-protection for drugs overseas, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.One of the recommendations in the documents, which would allow drug companies to discuss experimental drugs with insurers to speed up reimbursement after approval, provides a link to a policy proposal on the PhRMA website.The documents recommend deterring branded-drug makers from a tactic that prevents generic rivals from obtaining medicines to study them and produce cheaper copies. Drug-safety programs imposed on some drugs by the Food and Drug Administration restrict sales of the medicines, and generic-drug companies accuse branded rivals of using the programs to prevent them from accessing the drugs.But another person familiar with the White House discussions said the administration so far appears unwilling to go far enough to eliminate the practice, which generic drug companies argue delays their efforts to bring to market lower-priced copies of expensive branded medicines.FDA Commissioner       Scott Gottlieb       said in a website post Wednesday that the agency would hold a public meeting July 18 to \u201csolicit input\u201d on moves the agency could take to get approve generic drugs more quickly, including restricting use of the drug-safety programs to prevent generic companies from obtaining brand-name drugs for study. Dr. Gottlieb also said he wanted to work with the Federal Trade Commission to eliminate practices that could delay generic competition.Write to Jonathan D.

Those moves may leave four Indiana counties at risk of having no exchange insurers in 2018, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, though its researchers cautioned the outlook remains unclear. An estimated 44 counties in Ohio, Washington and Missouri will likely face a similar situation.The companies\u2019 announcements came on the day insurers had to make filings signaling their intentions to offer 2018 exchange plans. A smaller but high-profile company, Oscar Insurance Corp., said it was planning to expand its exchange offerings to include regions within a half-dozen states.Other major insurers\u2014Health Care Service Corp., Highmark Health, Kaiser Permanente, and             Molina Healthcare Inc.      \u2014said this week that they were filing applications to participate in all of their current marketplace states. But Health Care Service and Highmark both quickly cautioned that they hadn\u2019t made final decisions.Initial federal applications to offer 2018 marketplace plans were due\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0for insurers in the 39 states that rely on some aspect of the federal exchange HealthCare.gov. Despite the deadline, insurers have until late September to make their ultimate calls about marketplace plans.Together, the announcements showed the fluid situation in the health law\u2019s marketplaces, with insurers placing different bets amid the uncertainty. Senate Republicans are pushing for fast passage of a health bill, a version of which has passed the House. Insurers say they are unsure about\u00a0federal payments\u00a0that help reduce health-care costs for low-income ACA enrollees, which the Trump administration has threatened to halt. Some insurers also have raised concerns about enforcement of the current health law\u2019s coverage mandate, which likely won\u2019t be enforced under any Republican health overhaul.Anthem cited a volatile insurance market in its latest pullback announcement, and it said that planning and pricing for ACA plans \u201chas become increasingly difficult due to a shrinking and deteriorating individual market, as well as continual changes and uncertainty in federal operations, rules and guidance,\u201d including around the cost-sharing payments. The company previously said it would stop selling marketplace plans in Ohio next year.Anthem said it will continue to offer individual plans outside the exchanges in one Wisconsin county, Menominee, and five Indiana counties.The insurer is a major presence in its 14 state exchanges, with nearly 1.6 million people enrolled in its ACA plans, 1.1 million of those bought through the marketplaces. Overall, 302 counties in states including Georgia, Missouri and Ohio currently have only Anthem plans available in their marketplaces, according to the Kaiser foundation. So far, the insurer has filed 2018 ACA plans with regulators in other states, including Virginia, Maine and Connecticut. Anthem has said it is evaluating its ACA plans on a state-by-state basis.The new announcements, as with other recent insurer decisions, will likely be quickly seized on by both sides of the debate over the Republican health overhaul. House Speaker       Paul Ryan       of Wisconsin blamed Anthem\u2019s move on the ACA, also known as Obamacare, and said the 2010 law \u201chas failed our state.\u201d\u00a0Democrats have argued that the markets would be poised to stabilize, but Republicans are hurting the marketplaces by failing to provide insurers with clear answers on key questions like the cost-sharing payments.A growing number of insurers have said they will pull back or exit the exchanges completely next year. Anthem\u2019s decision in Wisconsin didn\u2019t immediately appear to leave any counties without 2018 exchange insurers, according to the Kaiser foundation. The four Indiana counties that might be bare of exchange insurers next year are Grant, Wayne, Posey, and Warrick, Kaiser said, though it is possible another insurer intends to enter those counties.Insurers around the country also have been requesting sharp rate increases, in many cases of 20% or more, for next year\u2019s ACA plans, pointing to a combination of market factors and federal uncertainty.Mdwise, which mostly focuses on Medicaid, said it was leaving the Indiana exchange because fewer Medicaid enrollees than it expected had moved to the marketplace, and it also referred to the \u201cgrowing uncertainty over the future of the federally subsidized exchange.\u201dOn the other side, Oscar said it aims to begin selling ACA plans in Tennessee for the first time in 2018, and re-enter the exchange in New Jersey, where it sat out this year. The insurer also will expand the regions where it sells ACA plans in California and Texas, and will continue selling plans in its home market of New York. Last week, Oscar said it will begin selling marketplace plans in Ohio next year, working with the Cleveland Clinic.Oscar\u2019s CEO,\u00a0Mario Schlosser, said he believed the marketplaces will stabilize, and the \u201capocalyptic scenario\u2026just won\u2019t come to pass, not this year, and not in the future.\u201dOscar has been under a spotlight partly because of its tie to the Trump administration: Josh Kushner, brother of       Jared Kushner,        President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, is a co-founder of the startup. According to his financial-disclosure forms,\u00a0Jared Kushner has divested his interest in Thrive Capital, his brother\u2019s investment firm, which is a major Oscar shareholder.Oscar joins             Centene Corp.      , a large insurer primarily focused on Medicaid, in choosing to expand a commitment to the marketplaces. Centene has said it will\u00a0begin selling exchange plans in three new states next year and increase the area where it sells ACA plans in six more states. Centene is entering Missouri and expanding in Indiana, Ohio and Washington, but it isn\u2019t yet clear if it might fill counties potentially left bare in those states.Health Care Service said it was submitting filings for products in all five states where it now offers plans under the health law. However, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of regulatory and legislative uncertainty concerning the 2018 individual market, and no final decisions have been made at this time,\u201d said Kurt Kossen,\u00a0a senior vice president.Highmark said it is submitting filings to offer plans in its three exchange states, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware, but it will make final participation decisions in late September. \u201cWe need stability in the market with, at minimum, continued commitment to [federal cost sharing payments] and the individual mandate,\u201d said Highmark Senior Vice President Alexis Miller.\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'Health Insurers Unveil ACA Plans for 2018.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 18:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurance-startup-oscar-raises-its-bet-on-affordable-care-act-1498039200", "news_title": "Anthem Says It Will Stop Offering ACA Plans in Two More States as Others Raise Their Bets ", "keywords": " affordable care act,anthem, filing deadline,health bill, health insurers, obamacare, oscar insurance, trump administration,vc industry news,Oscar Insurance\u00a0Corp.,Anthem,ANTM,Highmark Health,Oscar Insurance,Health Care Service,Molina Healthcare,MOH,Kaiser Permanente,Josh Kushner,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,health,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services,health maintenance organizations,private health insurance"}, {"content": "The Washington-based Family Research Council \u201cadvances faith, family and freedom in government and culture from a Christian worldview,\u201d according to its profile on the website of GuideStar, the nation\u2019s premier philanthropic rating agency. GuideStar gives the FRC a \u201csilver\u201d rating for demonstrating a \u201ccommitment to transparency.\u201d But the top of the profile page also declares: \u201cThis organization was flagged as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\u201dGuideStar announced this month that it would classify 46 nonprofits as hate groups based on the SPLC\u2019s imprimatur. GuideStar CEO       Jacob Harold       told the Associated Press the move was justified by an increase in \u201chateful rhetoric\u201d across the country.Aided by a veneer of objectivity, the SPLC has for years served as the media\u2019s expert witness for evaluating \u201cextremism\u201d and \u201chatred.\u201d But while the SPLC rightly condemns groups like the Ku Klux Klan, Westboro Baptist Church and New Black Panther Party, it has managed to blur the lines, besmirching mainstream groups like the FRC, as well as people such as social scientist       Charles Murray       and Somali-born Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a critic of Islamic extremism.A clear illustration of the SPLC\u2019s pervasive and insidious influence is the March riot at Middlebury College, where Mr. Murray had been invited to speak. \u201cThe SPLC is the primary source for the protesters at my events,\u201d Mr. Murray told me. \u201cIt is quotes from the SPLC, assertions by the SPLC that drive the whole thing.\u201dMr. Murray\u2019s politics are libertarian, but the SPLC labels him a \u201cwhite nationalist.\u201d In reporting on the Middlebury fracas, numerous news organizations repeated the SPLC\u2019s characterization without noting it was false. The AP even put it in a headline: \u201cCollege Students Protest Speaker Branded White Nationalist.\u201dHow did the SPLC become the default journalistic resource on purported hate speech, racism and extremism? Morris Dees, still the SPLC\u2019s chief trial attorney, founded the organization in 1971 along with       Joseph Levin Jr.      , now an emeritus board member. In its early years, the SPLC made a name for itself by winning some high-profile cases against the KKK and other white-supremacist groups. But over time its mission changed. In recent years it has focused on \u201ctolerance education,\u201d hate-group tracking (including an online \u201chate map\u201d) and fundraising.Although the SPLC is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and therefore statutorily prohibited from engaging in partisan politics, even a cursory review of its website belies its nonpartisan status. During the 2016 election, the SPLC posted \u201cMargins to the Mainstream: Extremists Have Influenced the GOP 2016 Policy Platform\u201d and \u201cHere Are the Extremist Groups Planning to Attend the RNC in Cleveland.\u201d The Democratic platform and convention received no such scrutiny.An SPLC post titled \u201cElectoral Extremism\u201d ostensibly profiles \u201ca dozen 2014 candidates, including Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, independents and others.\u201d Only a single Democrat is profiled, along with five Republicans and five third-party candidates. All of those listed are considered \u201cright wing\u201d or conservative, including the third-party ones. Even the Democrat on the list formerly belonged to the Constitution Party.Last August SPLC senior fellow Mark Potok tied       Donald Trump       to       David Duke,        whom Mr. Trump had denounced. \u201cAnyone with two brain cells to rub together can see the denunciations [of Mr. Duke] are not sincere,\u201d Mr. Potok told the Huffington Post. \u201cThe sad reality is that David Duke and Donald Trump are appealing to precisely the same constituency.\u201d Not quite. Mr. Trump took 58% of the vote in Louisiana. Mr. Duke, running for U.S. Senate on the same ballot, managed only 3%.The SPLC reflexively plays down threats from the left. This February Mr. Potok wrote that in the 1990s \u201cthe American radical right\u201d was \u201cdeprived of the bogeyman of communism.\u201d Even when condemning far-left groups, the SPLC shows an odd deference. Describing black separatists, the SPLC avers that \u201cmuch black racism in America is, at least in part, a response to centuries of white racism,\u201d and \u201cthe racism of a group like the Nation [of Islam] may be relatively easy to understand.\u201dKori Ali Muhammad allegedly murdered three white people in California in April. The SPLC reports that on             Facebook                   Mr. Muhammad wrote of \u201cgrafted white devil skunks\u201d and repeatedly referred to the mythical \u201cLost Found Asiaiatic [sic] Black Nation in America.\u201d Yet in contrast with its unequivocal (and false) tagging of Mr. Murray, the group describes Mr. Muhammad as a \u201cpossible black separatist.\u201dThe SPLC\u2019s work arguably contributes to the climate of hate it abhors\u2014and Middlebury isn\u2019t the worst example. In 2012       Floyd Lee Corkins       shot and wounded a security guard at the Family Research Council\u2019s headquarters. Mr. Corkins, who pleaded guilty to domestic terrorism, told investigators he had targeted the group after learning of it from the SPLC\u2019s website. The SPLC responded to the shooting with a statement: \u201cWe condemn all acts of violence.\u201dLast week the SPLC found itself in the awkward position of disavowing the man who opened fire on Republican members of Congress during baseball practice. \u201cWe\u2019re aware that the SPLC was among hundreds of groups that the man identified as the shooter \u2018liked\u2019 on Facebook,\u201d SPLC president       Richard Cohen       said in a statement. \u201cI want to be as clear as I can possibly be: The SPLC condemns all forms of violence.\u201dSome journalists harbor doubts about the SPLC. \u201cAny time a group like that is seen as partisan it undermines itself and its noble mission,\u201d a network anchor told me on condition of anonymity. \u201cAnti-LGBTQ bigotry is heinous, but classifying the Family Research Council in the same terms as Nazis did not help SPLC in its nonpartisan mission.\u201dStill, as long as journalists serve up what the SPLC dishes out, the group has little to gain by directly engaging its critics.

In a sign of solid demand for the IPO, Altice and its selling stakeholders sold more shares than anticipated.At that price, it is the biggest U.S.-listed telecom IPO in roughly 17 years, according to data provider Dealogic, when the tech boom ushered in a wave of cable and wireless operators. It\u2019s the second-largest U.S. offering overall this year in terms of deal size, after             Snap        SNAP 1.63%      chat parent Snap Inc. raised $3.9 billion in its March debut.The U.S. subsidiary of European telecommunications company Altice NV, formed through the merger of New York-based Cablevision Systems Corp. and Suddenlink Communications, is expected to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. The deal values Altice USA at more than $20 billion.Investors who bought shares in the offering will be making a bet that the U.S.\u2019s fourth-largest cable operator by revenue will be able to leverage the money raised and expand in an environment in which competition is stiff.U.S. telecom stocks have slumped this year. Shares of Altice competitors             AT&T Inc.       and             Verizon Communications Inc.       are down 10% and 15%, respectively, in 2017. European-listed shares of Altice NV are up roughly 20% over the same period.Investors also will be betting on       Patrick Drahi,        the French billionaire who founded Altice. He will retain almost entire control over the company after the IPO, according to a regulatory filing. Altice is offering Class A shares, which have almost no voting rights.Altice, private-equity firm BC Partners LLP and stakeholder Canada Pension Plan Investment Board sold 63.9 million shares. Altice updated its regulatory filing earlier Wednesday to reflect that it and selling stakeholders would be selling more shares than the 46.6 million it targeted earlier. It planned to sell shares between $27 and $31 apiece.Altice executives traversed the country during the telecom\u2019s pitch to investors, with executives making stops in New York, Boston and California, according to a person familiar with the roadshow.Altice\u2019s growth strategy in the U.S. has followed a playbook it rolled out in Europe and Israel, where Mr. Drahi tapped into investor demand for higher-yield corporate bonds to finance a shopping spree. Mr. Drahi, who has cited U.S. cable magnate      John Malone       as an influence, then cut costs to improve profit.Altice executives say the strategy helped boost the performance of its U.S. arm last year. Altice USA posted a net loss of $721.3 million last year compared with a $1.1 billion loss a year earlier. Its adjusted earnings rose to $3.35 billion from $2.77 billion in the same period, according to a regulatory filing.But Altice\u2019s approach has drawbacks: According to the filing, Altice USA\u2019s net debt stands at more than $20 billion.At the group level, Altice NV\u2019s debt stood at more than \u20ac50 billion ($55.74 billion) on March 31, and the company paid about \u20ac3 billion on interest payments last year, according to filings.Altice executives were pressed about some of these things during the company\u2019s pitch to investors, according to the person familiar with the roadshow.Investors questioned executives about the company\u2019s plan to convert its systems into an ultrafast fiber-to-the-home network and the cost savings that it still expects to wring from merging Cablevision with Suddenlink, according to the person.Altice USA shares are set to trade under the symbol ATUS.

Flipping the seat would have shown definitively the Trump presidency is a kiss of death for Republican candidates. But Republican       Karen Handel       won, by 3.8 points, blowing these story lines into oblivion.It was history\u2019s most expensive House race: Mr. Ossoff had at least $31.2 million spent on his behalf to $22.7 million for Ms. Handel. These totals will grow when more campaign-finance reports come in. The Democrats did not spend their money well. While Mr. Ossoff won 48.1% to Ms. Handel\u2019s 19.8% in the April 19 open primary, he received the same percentage Tuesday. Meantime, Ms. Handel won more votes than did the 11 GOP candidates combined two months ago.It would be understandable if Republicans took this victory\u2014the fourth in as many special congressional elections this year\u2014as an opportunity to celebrate. But the GOP has important lessons to internalize too.First, the ground game matters immensely. With multiple Republican hopefuls keeping the party apparatus neutral, only Democrats mounted an effective get-out-the-vote effort in April. But in June\u2019s one-on-one race, the GOP dusted off its old GOTV manuals, deployed organizers, and did the basic work of canvassing and phoning to persuade and turn out voters.Democrats increased Mr. Ossoff\u2019s vote by more than 32,000 over his April showing. Yet the GOP rallied some 96,000 more votes for Ms. Handel by focusing on Republicans who didn\u2019t vote in April and were unlikely to vote in June without special attention. The Congressional Leadership Fund spent $1 million on the ground game and digital ads targeted at 100,000 such voters. People who didn\u2019t vote in April made up at least 22% of Tuesday\u2019s turnout.Tuesday\u2019s results prove it is possible to make these contests about more than Donald Trump. Ms. Handel won 51.9% while data from one conservative super PAC suggested only 38% of voters approved of Mr. Trump. Enough swing voters apparently don\u2019t believe every Republican candidate is responsible for everything the president says and does.Anger at Mr. Trump alone won\u2019t attract the swing voters Democrats need to take Congress. Plus, Mr. Trump isn\u2019t inexorably destined to become less popular. His approval ratings could rise if he enacts reform legislation. Democrats must offer an attractive agenda to draw suburban voters while maintaining the outrage of their party\u2019s left wing. The Georgia election shows how difficult that is, even with virtually unlimited campaign cash.In open seats, the GOP needs to field candidates with records of getting things done in government, business or the military. Ms. Handel was an awkward candidate, but her record as Fulton County board chairman and Georgia secretary of state proved her effectiveness in office. This provided a strong contrast with Mr. Ossoff\u2019s exaggerated r\u00e9sum\u00e9.Republicans would do well to encourage congressmen not to retire. Incumbency alone doesn\u2019t guarantee victory, but independent and unaligned voters are often swayed by it. Passing ambitious legislation on the economy, tax reform, health care and defense could boost the incumbency advantage further. The fewer retirements, the more the party can focus limited resources on races truly at risk.Finally, Democrats have done better at building the networks to generate massive small-dollar contributions over the internet for special elections, but it\u2019s unclear how transferable that strength will be to the general election. Similarly, House Republicans have more resources at their party committee and super PACs, but it isn\u2019t clear that will be sufficient to re-elect the GOP House majority.After escaping defeat Tuesday, many Republicans felt not just relieved but exhilarated. It\u2019s fine to take a moment to be happy at Tuesday\u2019s outcome, but it was still a hard race in what should be a safe GOP district. The 2018 midterm elections won\u2019t be pretty for Republicans, but the election Tuesday showed they don\u2019t have to be a catastrophe.Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of \u201cThe Triumph of       William McKinley       \u201d (Simon & Schuster, 2015).Appeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-21 18:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-gops-narrow-escape-in-georgia-1498085246", "news_title": "The GOP\u2019s Narrow Escape in Georgia", "keywords": "2018 elections,goergia 6,jon ossoff,karen handel,midterms,trump,Jon Ossoff,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Amy Lopez       isn\u2019t the highest-profile official to be fired by the       Trump       administration, but she deserves some attention. The Obama administration had tapped Ms. Lopez after last November\u2019s election to build a semiautonomous school district within the Bureau of Prisons. Her program was to offer literacy training, high-school diplomas, postsecondary classes, and more options for prisoners with learning disabilities.Last month Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       terminated her, suggesting the Justice Department is poised to abandon correctional education reform. It\u2019s a mistake. This type of prison reform benefits not only prisoners but public finances and public safety.Every dollar spent on correctional education yields $4 to $5 in eventual savings, according to a 2013 Rand Corp. report, \u201cHow Effective is Correctional Education?\u201d The study also found that prisoner education reduces recidivism by as much as 43%.That\u2019s why I made a later-in-life transition from marketing for multinational corporations to founding the nonprofit       Petey Greene       Program, which trains college students to enter correctional facilities and tutor inmates preparing to take the high-school equivalency exam.But as powerful as education is, often it\u2019s outmatched by discrimination against people with criminal records. Very few people leaving correctional custody find employment on their first try. The Urban Institute found that only half of formerly incarcerated people were employed eight months after release. It can take more than a year for a returning citizen to find a job\u2014which means that something in addition to knowledge distinguishes a successful person, postprison: tenacity.That tenacity comes from correctional education. More than two-thirds of prisoners lack a high-school diploma. When they earn one, it\u2019s one of the first accomplishments they can remember. They learn that while success is never easy and may be delayed, it is still attainable if you work hard enough.It\u2019s easy to underestimate how powerful this message is to people who have been conditioned to think that they\u2019re failures. Their pride in succeeding, and their self-confidence\u2014feelings that have eluded them for so long\u2014carry them through the considerable challenges every returning citizen faces in getting a job.The federal prison system accounts for only about 10% of incarcerated people in the U.S., so there\u2019s plenty of room for innovation at the state level.

King Salman\u2019s long-anticipated decision to name his son crown prince almost certainly is intended to present a unified face to the kingdom\u2019s adversaries, especially Iran\u2014and to bolster U.S. support for a more assertive Riyadh.The royal decree removing       Crown Prince Mohammed       bin Nayef, 57, was said to be supported by 31 of the 34 members of the Kingdom\u2019s Allegiance Council, surviving sons and grandsons of Saudi Arabia\u2019s founder. The old crown prince immediately pledged his loyalty to the new one, who knelt in front of his cousin in a public show of respect.This announcement concludes a long struggle within the ruling family. Many royals had opposed Mohammad bin Salman precisely because they feared his father, now 81, intended to establish his own lineal monarchy at the expense of other family branches. The king won their support by amending the law of succession so that after the last of the founder\u2019s sons is king\u2014that will almost certainly be Salman\u2014the king and crown prince can\u2019t be from the same branch.The new crown prince had assiduously wooed President       Trump       to counterbalance support for Mohammed bin Nayef among the U.S. defense and intelligence establishments. Mr. Trump\u2019s strong support of Riyadh during his recent visit, coupled with growing Saudi-Iran tensions, seems to have moved King Salman to act. The new crown prince may be clearing the way for action against Qatar, which he has accused of supporting Iran and regional terrorist groups.Because Mohammed bin Salman has already been setting policy almost single-handedly, his elevation isn\u2019t likely to lead to any sharp changes at home, where he is pressing an ambitious agenda to wean the Kingdom off declining oil revenues and create a private-sector led economy. His reform plan, known as Vision 2030, is revolutionary. Out with government dependence; in with self-reliance. Out with antimodernist Wahhabi dogma and in with moderation. \u201cOur vision is a strong, thriving and stable Saudi Arabia .\u00a0.\u00a0. with Islam as its constitution and moderation as its method,\u201d he said in unveiling the plan a year ago.Even though the promised reforms have barely begun, they have sparked strong opposition as Saudi citizens feel the pocketbook impact of reduced subsidies for energy, water and electricity. Economic growth has nearly stopped as government cuts spending to ease huge budget deficits. The impact is particularly large because 80% of Saudi household income comes from government, which employs 6 in 10 Saudi workers.All this has led many Saudis to take a wait-and-see attitude toward reform. Many assumed that should King Salman die and Mohammed bin Nayef accede, the new king would fire his young cousin. That uncertainty is gone. Mohammed bin Salman may even be able to persuade his father to step aside, so as to guarantee the crown prince\u2019s accession. Power dies with a monarch, so the royal family could band together at Salman\u2019s death to deny his son the throne.With the succession settled, Saudi citizens are more likely to buckle down and accept painful change. The U.S. should welcome this clarity and do all it can to support reform inside Saudi Arabia as the best way to enhance both stability and human rights. The Trump administration also should welcome the prospect of working with a Saudi leader who seems to have bet his role in the royal family on partnership with the U.S. and assertive opposition to Iran.Now both countries need a workable strategy to confront Tehran, which is gaining power in the region at the expense of both Riyadh and Washington. Saudi Arabia under Mohammed bin Salman has gone on the offense at home and in the region after generations of cautious defense. It\u2019s one thing to go from defense to offense, far harder actually to score.Ms. House, a former publisher of The Wall Street Journal, is the author of \u201cOn Saudi Arabia: Its People, Past, Religion, Fault Lines\u2014and Future\u201d (      Knopf,        2012).", "news_time": "2017-06-21 18:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-is-not-your-fathers-saudi-arabia-1498085013", "news_title": "This Is Not Your Father\u2019s Saudi Arabia", "keywords": " mohammad bin salman,riyadh,saudi arabia,trump,white house,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Some actors you wouldn\u2019t mind seeing less of. If they retired you wouldn\u2019t miss them. Not       Daniel Day-Lewis.The 60-year-old British star announced this week he will no longer appear in films. Known for staying in character during production\u2014even between takes and at lunch\u2014Mr. Day-Lewis has always been legendary.\u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette,\u201d in which he played a gay, right-wing punk, and \u201cA Room with a View,\u201d in which he played an Edwardian nerd with a Pince-nez, were released in New York on the same day in 1986. Together they announced the arrival of a major new talent.While playing Hamlet at the National Theatre in London in 1989, he inhabited the character so thoroughly that he took the actor playing the king\u2019s ghost to be an apparition of his own dead father, the poet       Cecil Day-Lewis.       A spooked Daniel Day-Lewis collapsed backstage. It wasn\u2019t a stunt. He left and never returned to the play\u2014or to the stage.No one had ever seen, and no one had ever given, a performance like the one Mr. Day-Lewis gave as the Irish writer Christy Brown in \u201cMy Left Foot.\u201d Brown, who had severe cerebral palsy, couldn\u2019t walk or use his arms.

America was the first country of the modern era to put the idea into practice. It would be government by the people, following the rule of law, not the whims of a monarch or dictator.So far, we have kept it. But Franklin\u2019s warning was prophetic. Democracy has needed defense many times, both here and elsewhere. Lately, the world\u2019s oldest democracy has taken a few body blows.It started in February 2016, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch       McConnell       (R.,\u00a0Ky.) decided that President       Obama       was not entitled to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court because his presidency had less than a year to go. Oh, really? Where does the Constitution say that? (Nowhere.) Franklin probably turned in his grave.It got worse during the 2016 presidential election, when the Russians intervened massively to try to elect       Donald Trump.       Regardless of whether it succeeded, the Russian mischief constituted a blatant attack on American democracy. The nation went to war in 1812 over far less.In the coming months, we may learn the extent to which Mr. Trump and his surrogates collaborated with Mr. Putin and his\u2014unless the president succeeds in firing everyone investigating the matter. But we already know this much: Despite swearing an oath to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\u201d President Trump has not lifted a finger to get at the truth.That alone is dereliction of duty. Worse yet, Mr. Trump has covered for and laughed with the Russians, has fired the FBI director, and would prefer we believe that the interferences in the 2016 election were the work of \u201csomebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\u201d Despite all this and more, Speaker       Paul Ryan      defends him thus: \u201cHe\u2019s just new to this.\u201dWhich brings me to health-care legislation. Mr. Trump is new to that, too.On May 4, Mr. Ryan jammed the American Health Care Act through the House on the second try. He did so in a great rush, anxious to get a floor vote before the Congressional Budget Office had a chance to estimate the plan\u2019s likely effects.Mr. Ryan knew the CBO estimate would be bad news\u2014he had seen their score of the bill\u2019s abortive first version\u2014and indeed it was. When CBO published its estimate, it projected, among other things, that some 23 million fewer Americans would have health insurance within a decade, compared with ObamaCare. That estimate was down from 24 million for the earlier version, and was apparently enough to get some \u201cmoderate\u201d Republicans on board.Mr. Trump was correct last week when he called the House bill \u201cmean.\u201d Of course, he previously called it \u201cgreat.\u201dPerhaps the Senate bill will whittle the 23 million \u201closers\u201d down to 22 million or 21 million. Nobody knows\u2014not even most Republican senators, and certainly not any Democratic senators. And especially not the public, which holds an extremely dim view of the House-passed bill. A recent Quinnipiac poll found respondents disapproving of the Republican health-care plan by 62% to 17%.America is supposed to have open legislative processes, including such quaint practices as public hearings, exposure to expert critiques, debates in Congress and amendments. That\u2019s what democracies do, but what Messrs. Trump, McConnell and Ryan apparently disdain. Perhaps remembering Justice       Louis Brandeis\u2019s       observation that sunshine is the best disinfectant, they are growing the Senate bill in the dark.It\u2019s amazing that we don\u2019t know more about what\u2019s in the bill, for Congress normally leaks like a sieve. But if, as reported, Mr. McConnell plans to jam a bill through the Senate this month and then get the House to adopt the Senate\u2019s version, the Senate bill must hew at least modestly close to the House version.That would mean depriving tens of millions of Americans of health insurance, eviscerating the ObamaCare protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and making draconian cuts in Medicaid. In one particularly mean touch, the Medicaid cuts in the House bill come close to matching\u2014dollar for dollar\u2014the tax cuts, most of which go to upper-bracket taxpayers. That\u2019s about as close to robbing the poor to pay the rich as you can get.Well, almost. Most of us think of Medicaid as providing health insurance to the poor, which it does. But few people realize that more Medicaid spending goes for older and disabled adults, especially for long-term care\u2014which is so expensive that few middle-class families can afford it.

Several elevated thoughts are in order.It is not possible to overstate the importance of the Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous decision this week to confer free-speech protection on the Slants, an Asian-American rock band. That is because it is also hard to overstate the progressive left\u2019s determination to establish, in practice if not in law, limits on America\u2019s free-speech traditions.Ruling against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s determination that the name Slants had violated its \u201cdisparagement clause,\u201d Justice       Samuel Alito\u2019s       decision for the court was written with the rare clarity of a declarative sentence in the active voice: \u201cThis provision violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. It offends a bedrock First Amendment principle: Speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend.\u201dAnyone half-awake to American life in recent years knows there is a large effort under way to banish that bedrock principle of protection for words that offend. Free-speech traditions are under pressure on campuses, in high schools, in the media, in the streets and in sports.That the court\u2019s liberal justices\u2014      Ruth Bader Ginsburg,       Stephen Breyer,       Sonia Sotomayor       and       Elena Kagan      \u2014joined the majority suggests these four see what is going on, that letting the ability to speak one\u2019s mind slip away under this silencing weight will damage all Americans.What the free-speech diminishers understand, however, is that the way around a stalwart Supreme Court is self-censorship. If you are trying to suppress certain ideas and thoughts, the most effective means is to get people to shut up. The ideas you don\u2019t like will disappear.Like the Washington Redskins or Chief Wahoo.Some years ago, the notion emerged that school sports teams with names such as the Dartmouth Indians or the University of North Dakota Fighting Sioux were offensive, racist slurs.In 2015 Sen.       Harry Reid       leaned on NFL Commissioner       Roger Goodell       to ban the Washington Redskins\u2019 name. Mr. Goodell declined. The trademark office ruled in 2014 that the Redskins also violated its \u201cdisparagement\u201d clause, and the Supreme Court decision at least ensures that the logo is legally protected.That won\u2019t stop the political coercion cops, who are still deploying intimidation and shaming tactics beyond the reach of the courts and Constitution. All the informal silencing elements are in play to extinguish Chief Wahoo, who after nearly 70 years is pretty much the symbolic representation of the entire city of Cleveland.Unlike the NFL\u2019s Mr. Goodell, Major League Baseball Commissioner       Rob Manfred       is leaning on Indians owner       Paul Dolan       to drop the logo. Last month, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d\u2014which notably bills itself as \u201cfrom New York\u201d\u2014described Chief Wahoo as \u201cracist.\u201d Naturally, an ESPN commentator in April did a number on Chief Wahoo. Editorial pages in Ohio routinely call for a ban, which, needless to say, gives us some idea of where the truth lies.Last year, the Washington Post actually did a poll of Native Americans\u2019 feelings about the Redskins logo. The percentage who were offended was\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. 9%. The rest checked off \u201cdoesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d A Cleveland friend who\u2019s been going to Arizona for years says she has met plenty of Navajos who love Chief Wahoo.What is going on? In two words, cultural appropriation.\u201cCultural appropriation\u201d is the sort of thing someone like me gets paid to absorb so other people can keep their heads clear. Among the phrase\u2019s various uses, it means that the representative of one culture isn\u2019t allowed to use the images or traditions of another culture unless the second culture gives its permission. Got it?The art world has recently had several cultural-appropriation controversies, which get covered with eye-opening theoretical nuance by             New York Times                   culture writers. Minneapolis\u2019s Walker Art Center agreed to dismantle and ultimately burn a sculpture by a white artist after some members of the Dakota Nation objected.People like MLB\u2019s Rob Manfred think they are making a reasonable accommodation. But you can\u2019t. The exterminating left will pocket any concession and roll forward toward the next target. Agree to delete Chief Wahoo or burn one uncomprehending artist\u2019s sculpture as cultural misappropriation, and centuries of Western art will be heading to the furnaces or basements, with complicit museum directors holding the door open.An exaggeration? These days? I recall a       Buffalo Springfield       lyric: Step out of line and they\u2019ll take you away.This happens because people in positions of authority buckle. Which is why the Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous defense of the Slants and freedom of speech is breathtaking.Write henninger@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-21 18:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saving-chief-wahoo-1498084781", "news_title": "Saving Chief Wahoo", "keywords": "chief wahoo,patents,redskins,supreme court,the slants,U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "On the Fourth of July 1776,       Benjamin Franklin       was in Philadelphia, having helped to draft the Declaration of Independence, while his son, the governor of New Jersey, was under arrest in Connecticut, having been branded an enemy of his country for persisting in his royal duties and opposing the Revolution. In less than a year,       William Franklin       would be taken to the notorious Litchfield Gaol, a destination for, among others, \u201ctraitors\u201d who had abused their privileges in lighter incarceration.The history of loyalist William Franklin and his famous father has been told before but not as fully or as well as it is by       Daniel Mark Epstein       in \u201cThe Loyal Son.\u201d Mr. Epstein, a biographer and poet, has done a lot of fresh research and invests his narrative with literary grace and judicious sympathy for both father and son.Despite       Ben Franklin\u2019s       confession in his \u201cAutobiography\u201d that, when young, he had often had \u201cintrigues with low women,\u201d Mr. Epstein believes that William\u2019s mother was most likely \u201csomeone of breeding,\u201d perhaps a married woman whose husband was often away. In an unusual fictional preface to his scrupulously nonfictional history, Mr. Epstein portrays Ben Franklin in April 1731 taking the 8-month-old baby from his mother and bringing him to his common-law wife. She, in fact, would be the only mother William would ever know.As a young man, William and his father were close. During the early 1750s, William (then in his 20s) helped Ben in his scientific studies, flying a kite with him in a thunderstorm and later himself determining that a lightning bolt\u2019s electrical charge, despite appearances, moves from the ground up. During the winter of 1755-56, William served as an aide-de-camp to his father as Ben led Pennsylvania militia troops in mounting a defense against Indian raiders in the western part of the state. In 1757 father and son went off to London, Ben to represent Pennsylvania in opposing the Penn family\u2019s proprietorship of the colony, William to assist him and to study law. Before long, William became a lawyer\u2014and a father himself, to a son, mother unknown.By Daniel Mark Epstein  Ballantine, 438 pages, $30The new barrister, Mr. Epstein writes, was \u201chandsome, easy-going, more agreeable than his father by all accounts, politically shrewd, and extremely capable.\u201d In 1762 he was recommended for the New Jersey governorship. His father traveled from London to attend his son\u2019s swearing-in.For most of the 1760s\u2014a period marked by controversies over the Stamp Act and the Townsend duties on tea and other commodities\u2014father and son were of one mind about the British Empire and America\u2019s place in it. But in 1768 Ben told William that he saw a serious breach between the two countries developing. Two years later, Mr. Epstein says, Ben\u2019s thinking underwent a radical shift: Not content with repeal of all Townsend duties except the tax on tea, he favored keeping up the colonies\u2019 boycott of English goods.In the winter of 1772-73, Ben Franklin exposed inflammatory letters that Massachusetts Gov.       Thomas Hutchinson       had written calling for \u201can abridgment\u201d of colonists\u2019 liberties. Ben claimed that he had wanted to ease tensions with England\u2014by shifting some blame for them to Hutchinson. Most historians have accepted that, but Mr. Epstein finds it incredible and deems his motive a mystery. Whatever Franklin\u2019s reasoning, his deed led to him being blamed in England for the Boston Tea Party. Humiliated and disgraced, his reputation there in tatters, he urged William to resign his governorship.William Franklin, however, had no intention of doing so. \u201cYou are a thorough government man,\u201d his father had said shortly before the Boston Tea Party in December 1773, adding that he did not \u201caim at converting\u201d him. Less than a year later, no doubt disappointed that his son had not shown more outrage at his treatment in Britain, he told William disapprovingly that he was \u201ca thorough courtier.\u201dBen Franklin finally left England for America in March 1775. That June, the resonant shots having been fired in Lexington and Concord, he met with William, Mr. Epstein records, and tried to warn his son \u201cthat America was arming itself for war.\u201d After one more fruitless meeting, their communications ceased.William Franklin had been the last royal governor conducting the king\u2019s business when his prominent opposition to the Revolution led to his arrest. He was moved from comfortable detention to the Litchfield jail after he was discovered issuing official pardons to loyalists who wanted their properties spared by the British army. Nearly eight months later, weak and in poor health, he was released from his squalid dungeon and eventually set free in a prisoner exchange. He was able at last to escape to England\u2014and had he done so then, Mr. Epstein writes, he would have come to be seen as \u201ca high-principled, courageous British governor during a civil war.\u201d Instead, William resolved to remain in New York and fight. He stayed for four years, forming loyalists into a paramilitary organization that conducted raids in New Jersey and Connecticut.\u201cWhat he did then, as his father learned from prejudicial sources, was so appalling he could not possibly forgive him,\u201d Mr. Epstein writes. \u201cThat had been the turning point.\u201d But when William finally left for England in 1782, he himself was \u201cjustly satisfied\u201d with his past conduct. \u201cHis conscience . . . was clear.\u201dBenjamin Franklin little grasped his son\u2019s wartime hardships, Mr. Epstein says; nor did William grasp his diplomat father\u2019s struggles. A gulf of misunderstanding and ignorance separated them\u2014and would never be bridged.William Franklin\u2019s motto was \u201cPro Rege & Patria.\u201d Mr. Epstein\u2019s engrossing account of his ordeal in striving to be faithful to that motto illuminates the plight of the hundreds of thousands of British Americans who remained, during the Revolution, devoted to both crown and country.Mr. Landers, a former reporter at Congressional Quarterly and a former editor at the Wilson Quarterly, posts his reviews and essays at robertklanders.com.", "news_time": "2017-06-21 18:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-franklin-house-divided-1498084710", "news_title": "The Franklin House Divided", "keywords": "book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "The Wall Street Journal has fired veteran foreign-affairs reporter Jay Solomon for violating the paper\u2019s ethical standards, stemming from his dealings with an aviation tycoon whom he had cultivated as a source.The connections between Mr. Solomon and Farhad Azima, a Kansas City, Mo.-based businessman, were reported Wednesday by the Associated Press, which discovered them as part of an investigation into Mr. Azima\u2019s broader dealings. The AP reported that Mr. Azima has done secret work for the U.S. government and won lucrative government contracts.The AP reported it obtained emails and text messages between the two men that it said showed Mr. Azima had offered Mr. Solomon a 10% stake in a company he was trying to create.

Republicans who sat out the first round of voting in April flocked to the polls, producing record-breaking turnout, in part because the race had drawn so much attention.In the aftermath of the disappointing loss, the populist wing of the Democratic party blamed Washington consultants and Mr. Ossoff for not backing the type of economic policies favored by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Young House Democrats who have clamored for a change in party leadership bemoaned the effectiveness of GOP attacks that tied Mr. Ossoff to House Minority Leader       Nancy Pelosi.And in South Carolina, where Democrat Archie Parnell came far closer than expected to snatching a heavily Republican seat\u00a0Tuesday,\u00a0local\u00a0critics said they could have done better if party officials in Washington had listened to their pleas that the race was competitive and\u00a0devoted more resources to driving up turnout in African-American neighborhoods.\u201cI think that our leadership owes us an explanation for what happened, and how the resources were spent, but also a plan going forward,\u201d said Rep. Seth Moulton (D., Mass.). \u201cThat\u2019s got to be part of the discussion.\u201dDemocrats need to win at least 24 seats from Republicans in next year\u2019s midterm elections to seize control of the House. They were hoping the Georgia contest would kick-start efforts to close that gap. Instead, the result leaves them struggling to find a winning message to oppose President       Donald Trump       and split on the best way forward.\u201cWe have to offer big ideas to match the times we\u2019re living in and unless we offer an economic vision that people think is actually going to help their lives we won\u2019t be able to get the debate to be about policy,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat aligned with Mr. Sanders, who backs ideas such\u00a0as single payer health-care system and tax increases for the rich.Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who challenged Mrs. Pelosi in a party leadership election late last year, attributed Mr. Ossoff\u2019s loss to the \u201ctoxic\u201d Democratic brand and Republican advertising tying Mr. Ossoff to Mrs. Pelosi.\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that these ads are still effective,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThey\u2019re still moving the needle with voters ... and at the end of the day, that matters, especially when these elections are so close.\u201dPelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said that GOP attacks on her come with the political territory because she is a party leader, as the GOP did in the past with President       Barack Obama       and       Hillary Clinton.Mr. Ossoff\u2019s effort raised a record amount of money\u2014his campaign and outside-group allies spent more than $30 million\u2014in what became the most expensive House race in U.S. history. But in a special election in neighboring South Carolina, Mr. Parnell came closer to victory on a shoestring budget of less than $1 million. Mr. Parnell, a 66-year-old former Goldman Sachs executive, heavily targeted the district\u2019s African-American voters with little help from national Democrats.\u201cAs Democrats begin to chart a path back to a House majority, we must listen to state parties and the folks on the ground,\u201d said former South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison, who is now an associate chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThey have a better feel for the electorate.\u201dJane Kleeb, the chairwoman of the Nebraska Democratic Party and another Sanders ally, said that the party needs to focus more on local voters\u2019 economic concerns if candidates are going to appeal to disaffected Republicans.\u201cWhen you nationalize a race too much you leave behind voters who may think Trump is arrogant but are not ready yet to turn their back on a party of their mamas and papas,\u201d Ms. Kleeb said.Ossoff spokeswoman Sacha Haworth defended the campaign strategy, saying his economic agenda allowed him to build a bipartisan coalition and perform better than most Democrats have in the district \u201cdespite an unprecedented onslaught of attack ads by right-wing outside groups.\u201dMessrs. Ossof and Parnell continued the pattern for Democratic candidates in 2017 special elections: They did much better than their compatriots performed last November but not good enough to carry heavily Republican districts. In South Carolina, the district had elected its previous Republican congressman,       Mick Mulvaney,        by a 20 percentage point margin; Republican Ralph Norman won Tuesday by less than four percentage points. In Georgia, the district last fall elected       Tom Price       with 62% of the vote. On Tuesday, Ms. Handel won with 52% to Mr. Ossoff\u2019s 48%.Matt Bennett, vice president of Third Way, a centrist Democratic group, disputed the progressive critique of Mr. Ossoff, saying the party would have done even worse if the candidate had run as a liberal populist like       Rob Quist,        the Sanders-backed Congressional candidate in Montana who lost in a May 25 special election to Republican       Greg Gianforte.The month before, Democrats lost a special election in Kansas by 53% to 46%\u2014a far closer margin than the 27-point edge Mr. Trump enjoyed when he won the district in the 2016 presidential election.\"The only reason Democrats closed a 20-point gap\u00a0in 6 months\u00a0was because they had an avowed centrist running a clearly centrist campaign,\u201d Mr. Bennett said of the Georgia race.At the Capitol, morale among Democratic lawmakers was low\u00a0at a Wednesday\u00a0morning party caucus meeting. When Mrs. Pelosi asked for a round of applause for Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, the response was tepid, according to several Democratic lawmakers.The committee has identified 79 GOP-held districts it believes will be competitive next year and has had discussions with more than 300 potential candidates. \u201cThere are more than 70 districts more favorable to Democrats than this deep-red district, and Ossoff\u2019s close margin demonstrates the potential for us to compete deep into the battlefield,\" he said.Of the four contested special elections in 2017, \u200bGeorgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District had been seen as Democrats\u2019 best opportunity to flip a Republican seat.In the end, neither Mr. Ossoff nor Ms. Handel framed the race as a referendum on Mr. Trump, as people outside the district had.Whit Ayres, Ms. Handel\u2019s pollster, said the outcome proved that Republicans can still win even in a challenging political environment by focusing on local political dynamics, not Mr. Trump.\u201cThe president structures the broader environment but doesn\u2019t necessarily determine the outcome in particular races,\u201d said Mr. Ayres. \u201cThis election was clearly not a referendum on the president. If it had been, she would not have won.\u201dTurnout was 259,000, up 23% from the district\u2019s last midterm election in 2014, when 210,000 voted. It was also heavier compared with an earlier round of voting in April. According to the Cook Political Report, more people voted\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0than ever had in a stand-alone special election for a U.S. House seat.Still, Mr. Ossoff ended up getting roughly the same share of the vote\u201448%\u2014as he did in April.\u201cRepublicans recognized that this was a very significant and important race and they needed to get out and vote,\u201d Mr. Ayres said.\u2014Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.Write to Reid J.

But with traffic to traditional stores on the decline and chains like Sports Authority disappearing, Nike has been ramping up efforts to sell directly to consumers, especially its own e-commerce efforts.Both of Nike\u2019s biggest rivals,             Adidas AG        ADDYY -0.82%       and             Under Armour Inc.,        UAA 1.34%       sell some of their products directly to Amazon, which has been working to add fashion brands and apparel to its inventory.News of the Amazon deal punished shares of retailers, with             Foot Locker Inc.

Shares of Nike gained 2%.Nike executives have been in talks with Amazon for weeks about cracking down on counterfeit product and the proliferation of unauthorized third-party sales on the site, this person said. The two companies have reached an agreement where Nike would agree to provide some product directly to Amazon in exchange for Amazon policing counterfeit and third-party sales, this person said.Nike and Amazon declined to comment, as did Foot Locker and Finish Line.It wasn\u2019t immediately clear when Nike would begin shipping product to Amazon. Last week, Amazon began notifying third-party sellers that they have until July 13 to stop selling certain Nike products.The agreement between the two companies comes as both are making changes to their strategies. Amazon on Tuesday launched Prime Wardrobe, a service that lets customers try on apparel at home before deciding on a purchase.Last week, Nike announced plans to eliminate more than 1,000 jobs, or about 2% of its workforce, and scale back the number of sneakers and sportswear it makes. Nike sales have declined in recent months as the sportswear industry grows more competitive.The changes at Nike, along with the new partnership with Amazon, raise questions about how established retailers will be affected. Foot Locker and Finish Line each identify Nike as their largest vendor in securities filings, accounting for 68% and 71% of merchandise purchased last year, respectively.\u201cWhile this certainly wouldn\u2019t impact trends overnight, we do think such a development would represent another headwind for a sector that can\u2019t catch a break lately,\u201d said Charles Grom, an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research, saying it department stores face the biggest risk.Nike makes and distributes product along different tiers, so retailers like Foot Locker receive a different assortment than that offered at             Kohl\u2019s                   or             Macy\u2019s.       It is unclear which tier or tiers of product will be offered to Amazon.Nearly three-quarters of Nike\u2019s sales, or $22.6 billion, came from wholesale partnerships for the year ended May 2016, though the company has put greater emphasis on selling more directly to consumers. The company has launched new sales apps and opened new flagship stores, and is enticing customers to buy popular products like self-lacing shoes by making them available through Nike\u2019s sales channels first.Write to Sara Germano at sara.germano@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 18:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-to-sell-product-directly-to-amazon-1498067260", "news_title": "Nike to Sell Some Items Directly to Amazon ", "keywords": "does amazon carry nike,nike amazon,nike online sales,nike to sell on amazon,Amazon.com,AMZN,Nike,NKE,Adidas,ADS.XE,Finish Line,FINL,Under Armour,UAA,UA,Foot Locker,FL,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,retail,wholesale,shoe stores,specialty stores,mixed retailing,etailing,clothing,textiles,consumer goods,e-commerce,internet,online,leisure,travel goods,sports goods,sports clothing,footwear,technology"}, {"content": "No one should have been surprised that the Brexit talks began this week with an immediate capitulation by the U.K. government over the sequence of topics to be treated. Brexit minister       David Davis       had boasted during the recent campaign that the European Union\u2019s refusal to discuss a trade deal until sufficient progress had been made on settling Britain\u2019s outstanding budget obligations and securing the rights of EU and British citizens would launch \u201cthe fight of the summer.\u201d That was revealed to be empty bravado, given that the U.K. needs a deal far more than the EU does. Yet even now that Britain\u2019s lack of leverage has been laid bare, an air of unreality remains about much of the Brexit debate.One fantasy that refuses to die is the notion that the EU might somehow be persuaded to water down the principle of free movement of citizens, thus allowing the U.K. to restrict EU migration while retaining its membership in the single market. This idea first surfaced during       David Cameron\u2019s       doomed attempt to rewrite the free-movement rules before the Brexit referendum. It reappeared this week in a new campaign by more than 50 Labour politicians who want the U.K. to remain inside a \u201creformed single market.\u201d Yet it should be obvious by now that there is no appetite in the EU to water down the right of free movement, a point even Prime Minister       Theresa May       has conceded.There is certainly anxiety over immigration in many EU countries, but it relates largely to migration from outside the bloc. It is also true that some countries would like to reform the rules around access to welfare. But no other country shares Britain\u2019s neuralgia about the principle of the free movement of people, which is broadly accepted as the price to be paid for the free movement of jobs.When the single market in financial services was created in the 1990s, tens of thousands of jobs migrated to London from Paris, Milan and Frankfurt, in turn creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in other sectors. Britain today is host to millions of European jobs in all industries and all parts of the country. Why would any EU government agree to a deal that allowed the U.K. to retain European jobs while restricting them to British workers?A second fantasy is that the U.K. might engineer a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit by joining the European Economic Area alongside Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. This has the superficial appeal of keeping the U.K. in the single market, but it could never work as a long-term solution. Not only would it require the U.K. to accept the free movement of people, but would also oblige the country to become a rule-taker rather than rule-maker.That is bound to be unacceptable. Only this week, Chancellor of the Exchequer       Philip Hammond       accused some in the EU of advancing \u201cprotectionist agendas\u2026disguised as arguments about regulatory competence, financial stability and supervisory oversight.\u201d The idea that the U.K. could sit on the sidelines, as Norway must, when the EU next draws up banking rules is absurd.But could the EEA be a short-term solution to the U.K.\u2019s Brexit challenges, operating as a transitional arrangement while the long-term relationship is negotiated? This seems far-fetched too. The EEA doesn\u2019t pertain to the EU customs union, all EU free-trade agreements and agriculture, so it could only be a partial solution and would mean striking many other deals. A push to join the EEA would in any case be complex to negotiate, requiring not only the consent of 27 EU members but also the three other countries in the EEA. And the EU has been clear that any transitional deal must come under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice\u2014precluding one under the European Free Trade Agreement court that oversees the EEA.The truth is there is no soft option for the U.K.: The price of a transitional deal is almost certain to be continued adherence to all EU obligations overseen by the ECJ.The third fantasy is that the U.K. can negotiate a full new trade deal with the EU by the end of the Article 50 exit talks in March 2019. EU officials are adamant that it isn\u2019t practically possible to negotiate a divorce deal and a new trade deal in 20 months. Even if the U.K. capitulated to all the EU\u2019s demands, it would likely take a year to complete the detailed technical work on the withdrawal agreement and transitional arrangements, which would then need to be ratified, EU officials say. Nor is it legally possible either: The EU isn\u2019t authorized to negotiate a free-trade agreement with an existing member, and the EU\u2019s negotiating team would need a detailed negotiating mandate from member states before trade talks could start.This point was made repeatedly to Mrs. May by       Sir Ivan Rogers,        the former U.K. ambassador to the EU, who was frozen out by Downing Street for his efforts. Yet it suits the British government to keep insisting that both the divorce deal and a new trade deal can be reached in two years. One reason is that it allows Mr. Davis to present his capitulation over sequencing as a mere tactical retreat, on the basis that \u201cnothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\u201dMore importantly, it delays the moment when politicians must face up to the real choice: whether to make the ultimate capitulation\u2014pay the Brexit divorce bill in return for a transition deal with no guarantees on future trade\u2014or take the British economy over the cliff.Write to Simon Nixon at simon.nixon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 18:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/britain-still-believes-in-fantasies-on-brexit-1498083171", "news_title": "Britain Still Believes in Fantasies on Brexit ", "keywords": "brexit,European Union,U.K. government,Theresa May,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "New Jersey Gov.       Chris Christie       amped up pressure on the state\u2019s largest health insurer on Wednesday, blasting what he said are systemic failures by the company while pushing for legislation he has proposed to give the state more control over its finances.At a news conference, the governor said Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey has been the subject of repeated state-enforcement actions for more than a year, including a $15.5 million fine levied on Monday.The state Department of Human Services imposed the penalty for multiple problems related to the company\u2019s handling of Medicaid claims, including untimely and inaccurate processing, improper denial of claims and inadequate handling of complaints and questions from customers and health-care providers.\u201cHorizon needs to be held answerable to this,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cThe only way to do that in my view is through the legislation that we have provided to the legislature.\u201dA Horizon spokesman said the insurer was \u201cblindsided by both the timing and severity\u201d of the fine, which it said is retaliation for the company\u2019s refusal to comply with the governor\u2019s request for $300 million for a new state addiction-treatment fund.The spokesman acknowledged problems with the processing of Medicaid claims, which he said occurred while the insurer was changing vendors last year. He said Horizon was in close communication with the state while it resolved the issues and would appeal the fine.\u201cIt makes us question the motivation behind levying a large, and unreasonable, penalty without permitting the opportunity for the customary appeal and review,\u201d the spokesman said.The dispute increases pressure on Democratic lawmakers, who face a June 30 budget deadline with several key issues still unresolved. Democrats reached a school-funding agreement last week, but a person familiar with the negotiations said Mr. Christie said he wouldn\u2019t sign off on it unless legislators passed two bills he supports, including the Horizon overhaul.On Wednesday, the governor said wouldn\u2019t publicly discuss his negotiations with the leaders of the Democratic-controlled legislature until a deal is reached.Mr. Christie first targeted Horizon, a not-for-profit that covers 3.8 million people and reported $12.2 billion in revenue last year, in his February budget address when he called on the company to help fund addiction-treatment services in New Jersey. The insurer resisted, saying it would have to raise premiums to cover the cost.Mr. Christie repeatedly has criticized Horizon\u2019s lobbyist expenses, executive pay and perks for the past several months.Mr. Christie on Wednesday denied retaliating against the insurer. He said the state\u2019s investigation began in April 2016, long before his February budget address. Horizon, he said, paid $550,000 in fines between last September and this past March.The governor\u2019s proposed legislation would give the state more oversight over Horizon\u2019s finances, add four state-appointed members to its board and require the company to publicly disclose executive and lobbyist salaries and bonuses.Mr. Christie also has proposed mandating that Horizon profits that exceed the reserves required for it to remain in good standing with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association go into a revolving fund administered by the state for health services for low-income residents.Assembly Speaker       Vincent Prieto,        a Democrat, said last month that there was \u201cno appetite\u201d for Mr. Christie\u2019s proposal in his caucus. On Wednesday, he released a statement saying that he looked forward to further talks with state Senate President       Stephen Sweeney       and the governor, Republican.In addition to the Horizon bill, Mr. Christie said he wants to reduce the state\u2019s unfunded public-pension liability by injecting state lottery revenue into the system.

Its destruction comes nearly three years to the day Mr. Baghdadi used the landmark to announce the creation of his so-called caliphate\u2014a territory which has shrunk significantly in recent months. Since October, Iraqi forces backed by U.S. advisers and air power have reclaimed nearly all of Mosul, with about 4 square kilometers of the city remaining under Islamic State control.In a statement, Iraq\u2019s military called the detonation of the ancient mosque \u201ca historic crime.\u201dIslamic State, in a statement late Wednesday posted online through its media arm, claimed the mosque had been destroyed by an American airstrike.\u201cAs our Iraqi Security Force partners closed in on the al-Nuri mosque, ISIS destroyed one of Mosul and Iraq\u2019s great treasures,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Joseph Martin, Commanding General of Combined Joint Forces Land Component Command-Operation Inherent Resolve.\u201cThis is a crime against the people of Mosul and all of Iraq, and is an example of why this brutal organization must be annihilated,\u201d said Gen. Martin. \u201cThe responsibility of this devastation is laid firmly at the doorstep of ISIS, and we continue to support our Iraqi partners as they bring these terrorists to justice. However, the battle for the liberation of Mosul isn\u2019t yet complete, and we remain focused on supporting the ISF with that objective in mind.\u201dThe structure sat in the small Old City district where the militants are putting up a fierce fight in a city that they have all but lost, but at one point symbolized their startling strength.In July 2014,       Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi       ascended the imam\u2019s pulpit in the historic mosque and made his first public speech, declaring himself the leader of all Sunni Muslims. Built in the late 12th century on the western bank of the Tigris River, and once best known for its 150-foot leaning minaret, nicknamed \u201cThe Hunchback,\u201d it quickly became a symbol of Islamic State\u2019s grip on Mosul.His speech came less than one month after the extremist group\u2019s fighters swarmed Iraq\u2019s Sunni population centers, seizing about one-third of the country in a blitz that sent Iraqi forces into retreat and ceding control of Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, to Islamic State.The mosque\u2019s reclamation holds mostly symbolic value for Iraqi forces just starting to break the militants\u2019 fierce grip on western Mosul\u2019s Old City, a densely packed warren of narrow streets and alleys and brittle homes. Iraqi forces have struggled to advance through the area, with militants using an estimated 100,000 remaining civilians as shields to deter airstrikes and the use of heavy weaponry by U.S. and Iraqi forces.The Nouri Mosque serves as a gateway into the Old City.It was there that Mr. Baghdadi, in one of his only publically-recorded appearances in July 2014, gave a sermon admonishing fellow Muslims to reembrace the fight against Islam\u2019s enemies.\u201cIf you knew what lies in Jihad\u2014of reward, dignity, honor, and pride in the world and the hereafter\u2014none of you would have abandoned Jihad,\u201d he said.In his 2014 announcement, Mr. Baghdadi took pains to portray himself a reluctant scholar in the service of a greater cause, a stark contrast with the bloody scenes of his fighters slaughtering Iraqi forces during their lightning advance on Ramadi, Tikrit, Beiji and Mosul.The striking images of the group\u2019s previously unseen leader, broadcasting unfettered from one of Iraq\u2019s most recognizable historic landmarks, attracted a global audience that helped draw recruits.A senior U.S. official said the release of his later sermons provoked a wave of mass migration to Mosul and Islamic State\u2019s de facto Syrian capital Raqqa, drawing some 40,000 foreign fighters at its peak.\u201cIt was Baghdadi going to the Grand Mosque in Mosul and announcing the Caliphate and this notion of this historic movement,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt just shot up the numbers of people wanting to come.\u201dWhat came after\u2014a summer 2014 mass exodus of Mosul\u2019s minority Shiites, Turkmen and Christians, and the mass killings of members of the Yazidi minority on nearby Sinjar mountain\u2014ultimately drew the U.S. military back to Iraq and led to the formation of a U.S.-led coalition to fight the group and train Iraqi forces.\u2014Ghassan Adnan in Baghdad contributed to this articleWrite to Tamer El-Ghobashy at tamer.el-ghobashy@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'ISIS Destroys Historic Mosul Mosque.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 17:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-militants-blow-up-historic-mosque-in-mosul-iraqi-military-says-1498076169", "news_title": "Islamic State Militants Blow Up Historic Mosque in Mosul, Iraqi Military Says ", "keywords": "airstrikes,blown up,coalition,destroyed,isil,isis,islamic state,militants,mosul,nouri grand mosque,terrorism,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,risk news,military action"}, {"content": "Tropical storm Cindy began lashing the U.S. Gulf Coast with heavy rains Wednesday as it neared landfall, endangering a swath from Texas to Florida with what the National Hurricane Center described as potentially \u201clife-threatening flash flooding.\u201dOn Wednesday morning, a 10-year-old boy died as a result of the storm in Fort Morgan, Ala., on the Gulf Coast, said Capt.

The storm is expected to dump 6 to 9 inches of rain from southeastern Louisiana to the Florida panhandle, with some spots getting soaked with as much as 15 inches.Forecasters warned that potential flash flooding could be fatal.Forecasters said a storm surge could produce inundation of 1 to 3 feet along the Gulf Coast.

Even so, in an analysis first reported by the online news site Chalkbeat, Mr. Pallas found the academic gains at Renewal schools weren\u2019t significantly stronger than at the comparison schools.The findings are \u201cdisappointing but not surprising,\u201d Mr. Pallas said. The difficult task of turning around schools takes time, he noted, and the Renewal schools\u2019 additional supports may benefit children\u2019s physical and mental health in ways that his study doesn\u2019t measure. \u201cThe fact we\u2019re not seeing success at this point doesn\u2019t mean the Renewal program is a failure,\u201d he said.A Department of Education spokesman, Michael Aciman, called the analysis \u201cflawed and grossly misleading,\u201d in part because the comparison schools weren\u2019t similar enough to the Renewal schools, which were chosen for the intervention for a range of factors beyond test scores and graduation rates, such as teachers\u2019 skills.Department officials also said Renewal schools have boosted attendance, improved teachers\u2019 practices and reduced suspensions, among other steps.Mr. Pallas acknowledged the school comparisons weren\u2019t perfect but said his methodology was the best available and the department should commission a rigorous evaluation of the Renewal program. Several independent researchers supported his approach.Mr. Pallas found that for Renewal elementary schools, for example, 10% of students were proficient in math in 2016, up about 3 percentage points from 2014. In the comparison schools, 10% were also proficient in math last year, up about 2 percentage points from 2014.The picture was similar for English language arts, where Renewal schools\u2019 improvement of 8 percentage points, to 15% of students testing as proficient, exceeded the matched schools\u2019 gains by about 1 percentage point. Mr. Pallas said differences this small could be due to chance.Sean Corcoran, associate professor of education policy at New York University, said: \u201cI would hope to see bigger gains from schools that received so much attention and resources.\u201dFor Renewal middle schools, the gains were almost identical to those of the matching schools. At the high school level, Renewal schools\u2019 success in boosting graduation rates lagged slightly behind that of the matched schools. At Renewal schools, the four-year graduation rate rose to 59% last year, from 52% in 2014. Graduation rates rose citywide as well over that period.Jonah Rockoff, a Columbia University economics professor who studies education, said to measure the effect of the Renewal program, department officials would need to have a randomized controlled trial. \u201cUnfortunately, since they didn\u2019t build in a control group there\u2019s no way to get the real answer\u201d on its impact, he said.Mr. Aciman, at the Department of Education, said an internal evaluation of the program is under way.Write to Leslie Brody at leslie.brody@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 17:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/program-to-boost-struggling-nyc-schools-has-little-effect-on-test-scores-so-far-analysis-finds-1498082011", "news_title": "Program to Boost Struggling NYC Schools Has Little Effect on Test Scores So Far, Analysis Finds", "keywords": " education, mayor bill de blasio,new york city schools, new york high schools, public schools, renewal schools, school test scores,political,general news,education,school,university,college"}, {"content": "Top U.S. policy makers are set to offer Congress significant ways to ease regulation of banks, according to testimony released Wednesday ahead of a Senate hearing Thursday.Federal Reserve governor       Jerome Powell       and       Keith Noreika,        acting comptroller of the currency, said in prepared testimony they are studying how to simplify the Volcker rule, which aims to prevent banks from making overly risky bets with their own money.

Officials say their aim is to increase lending and boost the economy, but critics have said some of the changes would undo protections adopted after the financial crisis.Mr. Powell, the central bank\u2019s new regulatory point man, said in prepared testimony that it could be appropriate to ease annual \u201cstress tests\u201d for big banks, in particular the possibility that banks could fail the tests solely for \u201cqualitative\u201d reasons related to risk management.\u201cI believe it will be appropriate to\u201d remove that part of the test \u201cfor those firms that achieve and sustain high-quality capital planning capabilities,\u201d Mr. Powell said in the testimony. He also said the Fed could adjust assumptions it makes in the tests about banks\u2019 balance sheet and capital distributions.Any changes to the stress tests wouldn\u2019t apply to this year\u2019s results. The Fed is scheduled to release results of the annual exams on big banks in two parts, on Thursday and next week.Mr. Noreika, the acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, criticized regulators\u2019 implementation of the Volcker rule in his prepared testimony.\u201cThe Volcker rule provides a practical example of how conflicting messages and inconsistent interpretation can exacerbate regulatory burden,\u201d Mr. Noreika said. \u201cUnder my leadership, the OCC is undertaking improvements in our internal operations to attack that problem in ways that are within our control.\u201dMr. Noreika said he is working with staff to use \u201cone voice\u201d on how they will enforce the Volcker rule. He also said he has solicited suggestions from his agency\u2019s staff across the nation on how to reduce bank regulatory burdens, and has received roughly 400 responses.Many of the statements by Messrs. Powell and Noreika line up with a report released last week by the Treasury Department. That report also called for simplifying the Volcker rule, rather than repealing it as some congressional Republicans have advocated.Both the regulators and the Treasury report support a review of bank capital rules, particularly with respect to community banks. The regulators also endorsed raising certain asset thresholds in the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law, such as the section requiring banks with more than $10 billion in total assets to conduct stress tests.Mr. Powell said the Fed is reviewing the calibration of a key capital rule for big banks called the leverage ratio. He said firms with a custody bank business model in particular are \u201cdisproportionately affected by the leverage ratio\u201d.Martin Gruenberg,        chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., pushed back against some aspects of the Trump administration\u2019s plan, including a recommendation to eliminate his agency\u2019s role in reviewing big banks\u2019 \u201cliving wills.\u201d These documents outline how the banks could go through bankruptcy without needing a taxpayer bailout. The FDIC, which handles bank failures, currently shares responsibility for reviewing these plans with the Fed, which oversees bank holding companies.Mr. Gruenberg was tapped by former President       Barack Obama,        and the White House recently nominated Republican congressional staffer       James Clinger       to succeed him at the end of November.In his testimony, Mr. Gruenberg also warned against changes to the leverage ratio. Though the Fed is preparing to ease that rule, Mr. Gruenberg said it \u201cshould not be weakened,\u201d citing risks to the financial system.\u201cThe changes being proposed. would significantly reduce leverage capital requirements for large systemically important banking organizations and significantly weaken the resiliency of the U.S. banking system to future financial stress,\u201d his testimony said.Mr. Noreika, a former banking lawyer whom the Trump administration named acting comptroller in early May, made some of the most ambitious suggestions, including several that tread on other regulators\u2019 turf.He suggested removing consumer finance supervision of banks from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and putting it back into the hands of his agency and others. That would represent a return to the way things were before the 2008 financial crisis. The Treasury report also made that recommendation.He also suggested new bank applicants that are approved by the OCC would automatically have their deposits insured without needing separate approval from the FDIC. Another proposal said companies should be able to avoid being regulated by the Fed, in addition to other regulators, if most of their assets are held by banks rather than a holding company.\u201cOur system sometimes deploys multiple regulators to solve the same problem,\u201d Mr. Noreika said in his testimony. \u201cThat is an approach that can lead to waste, redundancy, and duplication of resources both in the regulatory agencies and for the institutions we supervise.\u201d\u2014Andrew Ackerman contributed to this article.Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com and Rachel Witkowski at rachel.witkowski@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 17:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulators-set-to-offer-bank-rule-changes-to-congress-1498076539", "news_title": "U.S. Regulators Set to Offer Bank Rule Changes to Congress", "keywords": "banking regulations,banking stress tests,fed powell,finreg,powell,stress tests,volcker rule,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Regarding your editorial \u201cRobert Mueller\u2019s Mission\u201d (June 17): In my lifetime I don\u2019t remember any special counsel investigation whose outcome benefited the country.

By such techniques, Iranians view Farda\u2019s internet site millions of times a month. They also use Farda\u2019s social network platforms as a means to discuss events in the country free of government control.Farda\u2019s goal is to provide its large Iranian audience with honest journalism.

Later I was a Republican member of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (2010-12), leaving that position when it became evident to me that U.S. international broadcasting was hopelessly lost, operating without a strategy and increasingly detached\u2014indeed, often antithetically\u2014to U.S. interests. When I was nominated to the board, several senators asked me to undertake an investigation into the Voice of America\u2019s Persian News Network (PNN), which was widely seen as having gone off track. I presented my findings to the first meeting of the board after my confirmation by the Senate. The PNN was a complete mess: operating without serious supervision, staffed haphazardly and perhaps penetrated at different places by Iran\u2019s intelligence services. I recommended its complete overhaul, but little happened given that most of PNN\u2019s employees enjoyed civil-service status. I understand that little has changed today.It\u2019s not just the PNN or Farda, which are the tip of the iceberg. Unless U.S. international broadcasting can be completely rethought, we are probably better off closing it down and starting over.

The average yield has climbed to 7.14%, up from 6.35% at the start of the month. Bond yields rise when prices fall.Oil prices extended their decline Wednesday after sliding into a bear market this week, down by more than 20% to $42.53 a barrel from their February high. Shares of oil and gas producers have already been falling all year, putting them among the worst performers in the S&P 500.Now, in the last two weeks, the energy high-yield market is starting to catch up to the stock market, fueling fears that energy junk bonds will experience a downturn like the one in early 2016 when debt investors saw low odds of survival for companies and many bonds traded at distressed levels.It has become pricier for some energy companies that are looking to the bond market to refinance or raise funds for drilling or acquisitions, said       Phillip Tamplin,        head of energy high-yield capital markets at             Credit Suisse.       Higher yields mean more expensive borrowing rates for firms.So far this year, debt markets have been largely open to producers. Low-rated U.S. oil and natural-gas producers have raised $7.75 billion selling bonds in 2017, compared with $280 million at this time last year, according to Dealogic.Just a few weeks ago, bond investors were \u201cwhistling past the graveyard\u201d and underestimating the risks that low oil prices posed, said       Ryan Kelly       of PGIM, the investment management arm of             Prudential Financial Inc.\u201cThe high-yield bond market is waking up,\u201d said Mr. Kelly, portfolio manager for high yield at PGIM Fixed Income, which manages $654 billion, referring specifically to the energy sector. \u201cThere\u2019s been a change in tone.\u201dBut others say the industry is in much better shape. Some producers have sold shares and assets to pay down debt in recent years, and the weakest players have been flushed out through bankruptcy, they say.Producers have slashed their costs and can turn a profit at much lower oil prices than they could a few years ago. And many have already replaced debt coming due with notes that won\u2019t mature for a few years, so they aren\u2019t facing looming repayments.\u201cThe industry is so much healthier than it was 12 to 18 months ago,\u201d said       Brian Gibbons,        an analyst at CreditSights. \u201cIt has lowered its cost structure tremendously and reduced its debt load.\u201dFor credit investors, oil prices between $45 and $55 a barrel weren\u2019t so worrisome. At that range, many U.S. oil companies could stay afloat and repay their loans, even if those prices wouldn\u2019t spur the kind of growth that stock investors want to see.\u201cFor debt to work, we don\u2019t need $60 oil,\u201d said       Scott Roberts,        head of high-yield investments for Invesco Fixed Income. \u201cA lot of these companies that have debt outstanding are making pretty attractive profits in the $47 to $50 range.\u201dBut that price range, which seemed like a lock for months, is slipping away. U.S. crude futures have been on the decline for four straight weeks, falling to their lowest levels this week since August as investors started to fear that the glut in crude wasn\u2019t going away.Prices of some oil and gas producers\u2019 debt have started to tick lower\u2014diverging from the broader junk bond market\u2014as oil dropped to levels that prompted questions about how these companies will cover their costs.Bond investors started to worry that oil isn\u2019t headed for a quick bounce higher. If producers stick to their plans to drill more wells, where is the money going to come from?\u201cNow people are questioning maybe this doesn\u2019t rebound. The patience starts to wane,\u201d Mr. Roberts said.So far, rising anxiety in the energy world hasn\u2019t bled to other sectors\u2014a change from recent years when a swoon in oil prices caused selloffs in high-yield debt broadly. Low-rated energy companies account for about 14% of the high-yield market, with $180 billion in debt.Mr. Tamplin from Credit Suisse said there has been a \u201cflight to quality\u201d even among energy investors.Some producers\u2019 bonds have been more sensitive to oil\u2019s plunge than others. Companies like Parsley Energy Inc. and             Diamondback Energy Inc.,       which work in the inexpensive Permian region and are in good financial shape, haven\u2019t moved much recently. But bonds that EP Energy Corp. sold at par in February have dropped about 8 cents in the last week and traded at 70 cents on the dollar Wednesday, according to MarketAxess.While some companies may have missed a chance to refinance earlier this year, most can afford to wait before tapping bond markets, said       Marisa Moss,        director of high-yield energy research at             Citigroup.       But if oil doesn\u2019t recover, it could become a more pressing problem.\u201cThey\u2019re sitting on the sidelines waiting for that bump in oil prices to tap the market again,\u201d she said.\u2014Sam Goldfarb contributed to this article.Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'Energy Sector\u2019s Junk Debt Loses Appeal.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 17:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-energys-high-yield-investors-sentiment-sours-1498080125", "news_title": "For Energy\u2019s High-Yield Investors, Sentiment Sours   ", "keywords": "bond prices,bond yields,corporate bonds,cost of capital,credit markets,energy sector,high yield,high-yield bonds,oil prices,oil sector,Parsley Energy Cl A,PE,Diamondback Energy,FANG,EP Energy Cl A,EPE,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,high-yield corporate bonds,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,energy"}, {"content": "Virgin Mobile, the phone carrier founded by mogul       Richard Branson,        will become the world\u2019s first iPhone-only carrier, the company said Wednesday.The carrier, which was acquired by             Sprint Corp.

That venture has struggled with declining participation and technical hiccups.The CFTC alleged that Charles McVean, chairman and chief executive of the Memphis brokerage, and       Michael Wharton,        its president, in late 2012 and early 2013 placed live cattle futures trades that would profit if the contracts\u2019 price moved higher. After establishing those positions, the CFTC alleged in its order, a consultant for the firm,       Samuel Gilmore,        called cattle feedlots to arrange swap agreements that involved the feedlots buying more futures contracts, also betting on higher prices. McVean Trading compensated the feedlots for those trades and controlled the positions, according to the CFTC, giving the firm and its executives control over positions that amounted to about 20% of the market.Officials alleged that McVean\u2019s bets, which ranged from two to four times beyond limits set by the CME, gave \u201ca false appearance of wide investor interest\u201d in the contracts, potentially influencing prices.McVean Trading, in a statement on behalf of the firm, its executives and the consultant, said that the settlement wouldn\u2019t impact on its clients or capital. A CME spokesman said the CME continually monitors and enforces market regulations, but doesn\u2019t comment on individual disciplinary actions.Craig Uden,        president of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, said more regulatory oversight is needed to protect cattle feeders from increasingly fast-paced swings in the futures market. Mr. Uden wouldn\u2019t comment on McVean\u2019s alleged manipulative tactic.Write to Jacob Bunge at jacob.bunge@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 17:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-accuse-brokerage-of-cattle-futures-scheme-1498079709", "news_title": "Regulators Accuse Brokerage of Cattle-Futures Scheme ", "keywords": "cattle futures,cattle trade,ranchers,scheme,traders,CME Group,CME,Commodity Futures Trading Commission,McVean Trading & Investments,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,commodity markets,agricultural commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,beef,dairy cattle markets,livestock,meat markets,agriculture,farming,cattle farming,beef cattle farming,financial investments,commodity contracts brokering,securities,commodity exchange activities,financial services,investing,livestock farming"}, {"content": "The dollar slipped Wednesday as investors digested weak oil prices and mixed messages from Federal Reserve officials.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, fell less than 0.1% to 88.91 after closing at its highest level in a month a day earlier.Investors are watching comments from Federal Reserve officials this week for clues on the path for higher interest rates.

SO 0.23%      , warning that they would not pass on more of its ballooning costs to ratepayers.Mississippi regulators\u00a0said they wanted the Kemper power plant, which has already taken $7.5 billion and seven years to finish,\u00a0to run using natural gas going forward, and don't want any additional costs to be passed on to electricity customers.The plant has primarily been running on natural gas, not coal, since 2015, because the company has struggled to make the clean coal technology consistently work.The regulators\u2019 action leaves Southern with a difficult decision over how to salvage its costly investment, including possibly having to write down\u00a0part of\u00a0the value of the facility.Ending the plant\u2019s clean coal experiment would be a major setback for efforts to use technology to remove carbon emissions from coal plants, an idea the Trump administration renewed its commitment to on Tuesday.\u201cWe are telling the parties to get a plan and get a settlement\u00a0in 45 days\u00a0that does not increase rates one penny,\u201d said Mississippi Public Service Commission Chairman       Brandon Presley.Jack Bonnikson,        a spokesman for Mississippi Power, said that until there was a new order approved by the commission \u201cwe have a responsibility to comply with the current order.\u201d The current order was to built an integrated natural gas and clean coal power plant.\u201cThe message is pretty clear. Mississippians don\u2019t want to pay for a ticket on a plane that isn\u2019t going to fly,\u201d said       Paul Patterson,        an\u00a0equity\u00a0analyst who follows Southern at Glenrock Associates LLC.Earlier this month, Southern\u00a0filed\u00a0documents with the\u00a0Mississippi Public Service Commission proposing to pass\u00a0on\u00a0some of\u00a0the cost of the facility to electrical consumers.After a closed-door meeting\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0in Jackson, Miss., the three commissioners voted give Mississippi Power a few weeks to reach a settlement but indicated they were not interested in passing on costs of the plant to consumers.They ordered all the parties\u2014the company as well as residential and industrial power customers\u2014to settle the matter by converting the operating certificate to run on natural gas, not so-called syngas\u2014or synthesis gas\u2014which is made from coal. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the plant\u2019s license could be revoked, the commissioners said.\u201cThey just put a dagger in the heart of it,\u201d said       Charles Grayson,        a Mississippi resident and retired consultant who has been a critic of the project.The Kemper County, Miss., facility\u2014which was forecast to cost $3 billion to build in 2010\u2014was intended to burn lignite coal, capture about 65% of the carbon-dioxide output and send the gas, via pipeline, to oil fields where it would be injected underground.The 582-megawatt plant can run on either natural gas or syngas, but the technology needed to turn the coal into gas and burn that to generate power has proved difficult to develop.In October, Mississippi Power began testing the coal gasifier, but leaks and other problems have arisen since then. Earlier this month, the company reported another setback when it said it needed to redesign a heat exchanger and replace it sooner than expected.So far,\u00a0the Southern unit has spent $5.9 billion on the power plant alone, and the rest of the cost on coal mines and pipelines to carry the captured carbon dioxide to oil companies, which would pump it underground to extract more crude oil from wells.The project\u2019s repeated cost overruns and delays have led to growing unhappiness in Mississippi.If Mississippi Power cannot find a way to pass on some of the remaining costs to customers, it will face a difficult financial situation. Its liabilities already exceed its assets by $1.2 billion, according to Southern\u2019s most recent quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Southern said it intended to provide loans or equity contributions to cover this shortfall.Mississippi regulators have already approved the cost of the portion of the facility that can be used to burn natural gas, but the majority of the cost of the facility was for the technology to turn coal into gas and capture the carbon dioxide.Write to Russell Gold at russell.gold@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'Clean Coal Plant in Doubt.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 17:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mississippi-regulators-seek-to-end-southern-co-clean-coalplant-1498077446", "news_title": "Mississippi Regulators Seek to End Southern Co.\u00a0\u2018Clean-Coal\u2019\u00a0Plant   ", "keywords": "carbon dioxide,carbon emissions,carbon footprint,clean coal,climate change,co2,natural gas,Southern Co.,SO,Mississippi Public Service Commission,corporate,industrial news,energy,electricity,gas utilities,electric utilities,utilities"}, {"content": "President Donald Trump will hold his first fundraiser of his 2020 re-election campaign at the hotel he owns blocks from the White House, a campaign official said\u00a0Wednesday.The\u00a0June 28\u00a0event will raise money for Trump Victory, a joint fundraising vehicle between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee.

For some investors and entrepreneurs, the message is that companies can\u2019t afford to place ambitious expansion targets ahead of basic principles.\u201cMove fast and break things, sure,\u201d said       Wesley Chan,        an investor with Felicis Ventures. \u201cBut don\u2019t move fast and break your people.\u201d Mr. Chan was previously\u00a0at GV, the venture-capital arm of             Alphabet Inc.       that is an investor in Uber.Mr. Kalanick resigned late\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0after Uber investors led by Benchmark\u2019s       Bill Gurley,        a company board member, sent him a letter that said they no longer had confidence in his leadership. Lacking support of investors and many employees, Mr. Kalanick departed despite his de facto control of the company through board seats and super-voting shares.As the company searches for a new CEO that can fix its culture, maintain breakneck growth and stem a torrent of red ink, the tech industry is reflecting on lessons of how to knock down market barriers and fend off competitors, but while doing it responsibly.\u201cRunning fast and working hard is not going to go out of style,\u201d said Marco Zappacosta, chief executive and co-founder of local services company Thumbtack Inc. \u201cBut something that will is the conceit that growth solves all problems. Turns out you can\u2019t grow yourself out of a culture rot.\u201dMr. Kalanick isn\u2019t the first hard-charging tech founder to be ousted, though others were often forced out because of disagreements with co-founders or after revenue growth hit a wall. In the most famous example, Apple co-founder       Steve Jobs       was fired in 1985 after he tried to get Chief Executive       John Sculley       removed.             Twitter Inc.       co-founder       Jack Dorsey       was pushed out after spats with other founders. Both later became CEOs of their companies.More recently,\u00a0health-benefits broker Zenefits pushed out CEO and co-founder Parker Conradamid regulatory lapses, but also because revenue growth was falling far short of expectations. Mr. Conrad similarly had voting control of his company.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s aggressive style and guerrilla tactics helped Uber battle regulators and taxi commissions around the world and push the company\u2019s valuation to $68 billion. His brash style was tolerated by investors,\u00a0who saw him bulldoze entrenched rivals in protected markets. Mr. Kalanick\u2019s success spawned a new generation of \u201cUber for everything\u201d startups that mimicked the company\u2019s business model, hoping to turn smartphones into remote controls to summon a range of services beyond cabs.But as the company got bigger, that mentality bred a culture that former employees say was overly aggressive and toxic. In the end the culture didn\u2019t evolve as Uber grew into a 12,000 employee company. Its human resources structure failed and Mr. Kalanick\u2019s management style went unchecked by investors.Mr. Gurley declined to comment. He tweeted late\u00a0Tuesday, \u201cThere will be many pages in the history books devoted to [Kalanick]\u2014very few entrepreneurs have had such a lasting impact on the world.\u201dCulture problems can have serious business impact at tech companies, where the difference between success and failure is often their ability to attract talent. Uber has struggled to fill a raft of open jobs, including the heads of operations, engineering, finance, marketing, legal and many other positions.\u201cIf a company does not build a strong culture and values, at some point it will no longer be able to recruit the most talented employees, innovate faster than competitors, and grow,\u201d said Bob Kocher, a venture capital investor with Venrock. \u201cI think at Uber, the lack of learning from their pitfalls and the unstable culture and churn of talented employees created huge worries about Uber\u2019s ability to deliver on the exceedingly high expectations that they have set for themselves.\u201d Mr. Kocher\u2019s firm didn\u2019t invest in Uber.Silicon Valley investors have been more deferential to company founders in recent years, partly because founder-led companies have been some of their biggest winners and partly because abundant capital enabled founders of hot companies to drive hard bargains.The percentage of U.S.-based venture-backed companies valued north of $1 billion that secured super-voting shares from investors increased from 20% in 2014 to 39% in 2016, according to a survey by law firm Fenwick & West.But the trend has started to reverse, says Ivan Gaviria, a lawyer with GundersonDettmer.\u201cWe already hit \u2018peak founder control\u2019 about 18 months ago from a governance and structuring point of view,\u201d Mr. Gaviria wrote in an email.", "news_time": "2017-06-21 16:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-kalanicks-fall-means-for-silicon-valley-culture-1498078684", "news_title": "What Kalanick\u2019s Fall Means for Silicon Valley Culture", "keywords": "silicon valley,silicon valley culture,startups,uber ceo,uber culture,uber harassment,uber probe,vc analysis,Uber Technologies,Felicis Ventures,Alphabet Inc.

Its other co-founders are Rande Gerber, husband of supermodel Cindy Crawford, and real-estate tycoon Mike Meldman.The Casamigos deal is Diageo\u2019s first since 2015. The company had been focused on jump-starting sales in the U.S., its biggest market, where performance has until recently been weak as consumers abandoned brands like Smirnoff and Captain Morgan for smaller rivals.Diageo plans to expand Casamigos internationally, saying it sees strong potential across Western Europe in particular. The tequila comes in three variants that sell for between $45\u00a0and $55\u00a0a bottle.\u201cThe category is relatively underdeveloped outside North America and we see a huge opportunity for our existing brands and Casamigos,\u201d said Diageo\u2019s North America head       Deirdre Mahlan       on a call with reporters.The deal is Diageo\u2019s second in premium tequila in recent years. The drinks giant in 2015 swapped its Bushmills Irish whiskey brand for Don Julio, previously owned by Jose Cuervo. It also owns two other tequila brands, Peligroso and DeLeon, but these are much smaller, selling under 10,000 cases a year according to Ms. Mahlan.Diageo, like its rivals, has said it would focus on growing premium brands as the company grapples with a stricter regulatory environment. Alcohol volumes in major developed markets have also dropped as people drink less but better.As part of that push, the London-based company recently launched an upscale Irish whiskey brand called Roe & Co. and has also launched pricey bourbon brands like Blade and Bow and Hilhaven.Diageo said the deal will be earnings neutral for the first three years and accretive thereafter.

Several investors pushed Mr. Kalanick to resign, people familiar with the matter said, to help turn around the company as it works to battle allegations that it has a workplace permissive of sexual harassment and sexism.Uber has no replacement for Mr. Kalanick and is running without financial and operating chiefs and other key executives after several recent departures, including one of the CEO\u2019s top deputies who was pushed out last week by the board.\u201cI love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,\u201d Mr. Kalanick said in a statement Tuesday.A group of investors on Tuesday banded together in a bid to oust him, according to people familiar with the matter. They sent a letter to Mr. Kalanick expressing their doubt about his ability to implement changes to the company as recommended by the law firm of former U.S. Attorney General       Eric Holder       following an investigation into workplace culture. The firm\u2019s list of nearly 50 recommendations was endorsed by the board.The investors who drafted the letter include Benchmark,\u200bwhose partner\u200b      Bill Gurley      \u200bis an Uber board member; Menlo Ventures; Lowercase Capital; First Round Capital; and Fidelity Investments, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Kalanick handed in his resignation just hours after the letter was sent and after speaking with one board member, who counseled him to step aside, according to a person familiar with the matter.Mr. Kalanick had been on indefinite leave from the company as of last week, a move he said was necessary to mourn the sudden death of his mother last month in a boating accident, and with an aim to re-emerge as a newly invigorated leader.\u201cThis is a bold decision and a sign of his devotion and love for Uber,\u201d said members of Uber\u2019s board in a statement Tuesday. \u201cBy stepping away, he\u2019s taking the time to heal from his personal tragedy while giving the company room to fully embrace this new chapter in Uber\u2019s history.\u201dMr. Kalanick will likely remain a figure in the company that he co-founded in 2009 since he will keep his board seat and, along with co-founder Garrett Camp and early employee       Ryan Graves,        holds a majority of Uber\u2019s voting rights. Mr. Camp is chairman of the board.When Uber announced Mr. Kalanick\u2019s leave last week, the company said it would be run by a committee of 14 executives, including the chief technology officer, regional managers and heads of legal, product, operations and other areas.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s departure exposes Uber\u2019s leadership shortcomings and raises the question of who can lead a company whose defiantly competitive startup culture and leadership style reflected the pugnacious chief executive.Mr. Kalanick didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\u200bThe next CEO will face a nearly unprecedented set of challenges, including restoring rattled employees\u2019 faith in the company, as well a business that lost at least $2.8 billion last year and another $708 million in this year\u2019s first quarter, due in large part to cash incentives necessary to keep drivers driving. Uber is also tasked with a tremendous shift in culture from \u200bthe \u200bone \u200bcrafted\u200b under Mr. Kalanick that often operated in a legal gray area, including pushing in cities where its service was barred, and \u200brewarding high performers despite misbehavior.Even before Uber\u2019s string of scandals began earlier this year, Mr. Kalanick had come to embody an extreme version of the archetypal brash startup CEO who succeeds by thumbing his nose at convention and pushing the boundaries of established business practices. Uber\u2014with a valuation of nearly $70 billion that exceeds companies such as             Ford Motor Co.      \u2014was the epitome of a new breed of startup using software to reshape long-entrenched industries from transportation to hospitality to health care.But the mood changed at Uber after a former software engineer, Susan Fowler Rigetti, alleged chauvinism at the ride-hailing firm in February. Many employees, and some investors began questioning Mr. Kalanick\u2019s acumen to remain at the helm.In rapid succession, Uber faced a lawsuit from Google parent             Alphabet Inc.       over allegedly stolen technology, a federal probe looking into technology used to evade regulators, an exodus of executives, and it admitted that it erroneously withheld tens of millions of dollars from New York City and Philadelphia drivers over more than two years. The blows threaten to harm Uber\u2019s reputation with drivers, expose it to legal challenges, slow its push toward developing self-driving vehicles and complicate its prospect for an initial public offering.The series of controversies and missteps\u2014including a leaked video showing Mr. Kalanick berating an Uber driver\u2014prompted the CEO to publicly plead, \u201cI need leadership help,\u201d and announce plans to hire a chief operating officer.The results of the nearly four-month investigation by Mr. Holder\u2019s firm, Covington & Burling LLP, pointed to a wealth of cultural and leadership problems. The executive summary, released a week ago, called for Uber among other things to install more independent board seats, create an oversight committee, establish leadership coaching for executives and roll out mandatory sensitivity training for employees.The report\u2019s summary also zeroed in on aspects of a corporate culture it said reinforces exclusionary and other poor behavior. Uber\u2019s 14 cultural values, for instance, include mandates such as \u201calways be hustlin\u2019\u201d and \u201ctoe stepping.\u201d The report suggested restrictions on alcohol consumption and the use of controlled substances at the office, as well as romantic relationships among colleagues.Another internal investigation, conducted by law firm Perkins Coie LLP, unearthed more than 200 workplace complaints and led to 20 firings, as well as dozens of reprimands and mandatory trainings. That investigation is ongoing.Uber\u2019s public-relations crisis spiraled further last week when a board member,       David Bonderman,        resigned and apologized after making a sexist remark as he and other directors were addressing Uber\u2019s roughly 12,000 employees about the results of the Covington investigation.That resignation came days after Uber fired a top executive, Eric Alexander, after reporters inquired about his involvement in obtaining medical records of a woman raped by an Uber driver, and then sharing it with top executives including Mr. Kalanick. Mr. Alexander and Mr. Kalanick haven\u2019t commented on the incident.The company recently added       Wan Ling Martello,        a             Nestle SA       executive, to its board, but Mr. Bonderman\u2019s seat remains open.\u200b\u200bWrite to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 16:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns-1498023559", "news_title": "Uber CEO Travis Kalanick Quits as Investors Revolt", "keywords": "kalanick, resignation, resigns, travis kalanick,uber, uber ceo, uber chief,vc people,Uber Technologies,Travis Kalanick,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,political,general news,society,community,human rights,civil liberties,women's rights,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday it would make more visas available for seasonal summer workers, responding to complaints from businesses and members of Congress about a significant shortfall.By law, the number of H-2B visas is capped at 66,000, divided between the summer and winter seasons. This year, the allotment was exhausted in March. The visas, which are for temporary, nonagricultural jobs, are used in tourism and other industries.In past years, Congress has exempted returning workers from the cap, enabling many additional foreigners to participate in the program, but lawmakers didn\u2019t renew that exception for this year. Instead, in May Congress gave DHS authority to add additional visas if Secretary       John Kelly       found businesses that were at risk without them.\u201cThe Secretary did not make this decision lightly and is exercising his authority in an effort to help businesses around the country at risk of failing,\u201d spokesman       Dave Lapan       said in a statement Wednesday. He added that Congress was \u201cpassing the buck\u201d by not clearly legislating how many visas should be issued and said Mr. Kelly \u201cexpects that this one-time occurrence is an anomaly.\u201dDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, President       Donald Trump       said regularly that American workers\u2019 interests are threatened by foreigners who are both legally and illegally in the U.S. Still, his own Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., has used many H-2B workers in the winter season.In its statement, DHS emphasized the need to protect American jobs.\u201cThe Administration and the Department are committed to protecting American jobs and U.S. workers,\u201d Mr. Lapan said. \u201cDHS is only seeking to provide visas to truly seasonal industries that would be severely/significantly harmed by not receiving H2B visas which would adversely impact US workers employed by these seasonal businesses.\u201dHe said it wasn\u2019t yet clear how many additional visas would be approved and said that the new supply may not be ready until late July at the earliest. He cited the need to work with the Labor Department to identify businesses \u201ctruly at risk\u201d without additional temporary workers, in addition to a multistep regulatory process.In May, a bipartisan group of lawmakers urged Mr. Kelly and Labor Secretary       Alexander Acosta       to approve the additional visas that Congress authorized. \u201cWe encourage you to take swift and decisive action to ensure that small and seasonal businesses in our states can get the workers necessary to ensure a successful season,\u201d the group wrote in a letter.Terry Smily,        who owns three Wendy\u2019s franchises on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, said he has employed about a dozen H-2B workers from Jamaica each summer for the last 10 or so years.\u201cThis year, we have none,\u201d he said.Other businesses are running into the same problems, he said.He said his restaurants are surviving on a combination of foreigners using another visa program and workers recruited from Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, plus \u201cpaying a ton of overtime.\u201dForeigners are needed, Mr. Smily said, because most Americans living in the area are older or not interested in working in the hospitality industry. \u201cI would hire whatever Americans walked in my door,\u201d he said.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'After Pressure, Administration Boosts Seasonal-Worker Visas.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 16:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/homeland-security-department-to-issue-more-visas-for-summer-workers-1498077312", "news_title": "Homeland Security Department to Issue More Visas for Summer Workers ", "keywords": " h-2b, h-2b visas, labor shortage , seasonal jobs,seasonal workers, work visas,Department of Homeland Security,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,department of homeland security,executive branch"}, {"content": "Family-owned magazine publisher Rodale Inc. said Wednesday it is considering a sale of the company or its properties among other options as part of a strategic review.The company\u2019s titles include Prevention, Men\u2019s Health, Women\u2019s Health, and Runner\u2019s World.\u201cWe are excited to explore opportunities for potential buyers of our business who can build on the strong foundation of our commitment to inspiring health, healing, happiness and love by enhancing core capabilities and resources for our brands,\u201d said Rodale Chief Executive       Maria Rodale.No timetable has been set for the review, which won\u2019t necessarily result in a transaction, the company said.A call to Rodale seeking further comment wasn\u2019t immediately returned.Rodale\u2019s announcement drew a statement of interest from             Meredith Corp.

Analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal were expecting a two-million-barrel drawdown.Gasoline stockpiles also fell more than anticipated\u2014dropping by 578,000 barrels, compared with the 100,000 barrel decline that analysts had been anticipating.The declines should have been welcome news for investors anxiously awaiting indications that bloated U.S. oil supplies are shrinking\u2014a signal that production cuts implemented by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers this year are working.\u201cThe majority view was if we had draws in crude and gasoline, we would have some kind of rally,\u201d said       Bob Yawger,        director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. \u201cIt looks to me that folks took that opportunity to be sellers of the rally.\u201dAnd U.S. producers have rushed in to fill the void left by OPEC.

The census data show that in 2015, 32% of New Yorkers\u2019 income went to rent and utilities, compared with 32.7% a year earlier.The board paved the way for an increase in rents this year when it took a preliminary vote in April, setting the range of possible increases at 1% to 3% for tenants who choose one-year leases and 2% to 4% for those who opt for two-year leases.Landlords say the nine-member board has favored tenants under Mr. de Blasio and has starved buildings struggling with high costs.\u201cThe tenants are on a tear because they are playing the game on home turf,\u201d said       Jack Freund,        executive vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents 25,000 property owners and agents.The final vote is due to take place Tuesday, and a test for the board will be whether it adopts the 1% minimum preliminary increase or something more.The board has five public members, who often vote as a bloc, and two tenant and two owner representatives. One board member said it is possible the tenant representative would propose a resolution calling for a 1% increase, in hopes of garnering the support of at least three public members and precluding a higher increase.Mr. de Blasio campaigned on a promise of a rent freeze, and since he took office rents on one-year leases have gone up a total of 1% over three years, due to a 1% increase adopted soon after he took office, when the board still had members appointed by former Mayor       Michael Bloomberg.After last year\u2019s rent freeze, building owners sued, saying the process was politically motivated, and ignored the primary mission of the board to approve increases based on economic conditions and costs in the real-estate industry. The suit was dismissed in March, but the industry is appealing.Mr. de Blasio takes credit for appointing members who give greater weight to \u201caffordability for tenants.\u201d In earlier administrations, \u201cthe landlord lobby got big rent hikes regardless of the data,\u201d a spokesman said.\u201cWhen you add up the four years I\u2019ve been in office, this is by far the lowest increase over four years in the history of the Rent Guidelines Board, which goes back almost a half a century,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in an interview after the preliminary range of increases was announced in April. \u201cAnd they\u2019re finally respecting tenants as much as they do landlords.\u201dThe prospect of at least a 1% increase was shaped by a board study of operating costs, showing they rose 6.2% over the past year, or 4.5% after excluding the volatile costs of heating fuel.\u00a0Property taxes, which account for about a quarter of all costs, were up 7.8%, the study said.Scott Walsh,        an owner representative on the board, said rent freezes are a problem for buildings more than 50 years old that can have intensive maintenance needs.The mayor said the board he appointed is acting \u201cbased on the facts,\u201d but Mr. Walsh disagrees. \u201cIt is becoming clear that the mayor wants to run an unofficial social service agency on the backs of owners,\u201d he said.At a series of five public hearings earlier this month, 304 people spoke, with tenants outnumbering landlords 16-1. Ms. Romm, who is now 77, was the first speaker at a hearing in Manhattan. \u201cA rent rollback will help the city\u2019s economy,\u201d she told the board. \u201cHelp save an endangered species, the rent stabilized tenant.\u201dWrite to Josh Barbanel at josh.barbanel@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 16:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-board-set-to-raise-rents-in-big-win-for-landlords-1498037402", "news_title": "Decision on Regulated Rents Comes Due in New York", "keywords": " bill de blasio, landlords,new york city, rent,rent regulated, rent-stabilized apartments, tenants,political,general news,society,community,real estate transactions,residential building leasing,real estate,construction,residential real estate"}, {"content": "Stocks rallied in Saudi Arabia but slid in Argentina after index provider             MSCI Inc.        MSCI 0.57%       weighed in on whether they qualify as emerging markets, a classification that could guide billions of dollars of foreign investment.Saudi Arabia\u2019s benchmark Tadawul stock index rose 5.5% after MSCI said it would consider adding Saudi stocks to its emerging-markets index in its next review. Argentina\u2019s Merval fell more than 5% after MSCI said it isn\u2019t convinced the country is ready to be included.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is a widely used benchmark, with $1.6 trillion tracking the index, according to MSCI. China\u2019s A-shares, stocks denominated in yuan and listed in either Shanghai or Shenzhen, won inclusion Tuesday after rejections in the previous three years, opening up the country to billions in international investment in the coming years.MSCI\u2019s decision to retain Argentina\u2019s status as a frontier country surprised investors who\u2019d widely expected it to return to the emerging-market index. MSCI reduced the country to frontier status eight years ago, citing concerns over its currency controls.In 2015, a new administration under President       Mauricio Macri       instituted an economic overhaul, moving the country out of its default on foreign debt, abolishing foreign-exchange restrictions and relaxing capital controls.As a result, the country has regained favor with emerging-markets investors. The government was able to return to international debt markets in April 2016 with a $16.5 billion global bond, which at the time was the largest-ever sovereign bond issuance. This week, it sold a 100-year bond to investors in what was the first century bond ever for a junk-rated sovereign government.MSCI said Tuesday that while Argentina meets most of its criteria to re-enter its emerging-markets index, many investors say it\u2019s too soon to know whether the overhauls will stick.With Argentina closing in on midterm elections this October, many investors are viewing the results as a gauge for the Macri administration\u2019s long-term prospects. Former President       Cristina Kirchner,        a Macri critic, is expected to compete for a seat in the Senate in the key province of Buenos Aires. Risk consultancy Eurasia Group says the election of a Macri supporter in Buenos Aires is key to furthering the president\u2019s agenda.Meanwhile, MSCI said that it would consider adding Saudi stocks to its index next year, citing several moves aimed at lowering the barrier to entry for foreign investors. This year, the exchange began to allow short selling, overhauled its settlement process and lowered a limit that previously had allowed only large asset managers to directly buy and sell stocks.Saudi Arabia\u2019s Tadawul has registered 68 international financial institutions since opening its market to foreign investment in June 2015, with some saying it\u2019s a way to buy into the kingdom\u2019s vision for an economy that goes beyond oil.\u201cIt is an objective to diversify the Saudi economy from being heavily dependent on oil to one that focuses on education, investment arms of the government and technology,\u201d       Khalid Al Hussan,        chief executive of the Saudi Stock Exchange, said in an interview.Also Wednesday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s       King Salman      designated his son, Mohammed bin Salman, as his successor. The prince has been leading a charge to reduce the kingdom\u2019s dependence on oil.While 90% of Saudi Arabia\u2019s revenue come from oil, energy companies represent 0.5% of its stock index by market capitalization, according to UBS Wealth Management. Investors are betting that a coming initial public offering of Saudi Aramco would raise funds to aid the government\u2019s economic diversification efforts and improve the outlook for everything from banks to insurance companies to education providers.Foreign ownership of Saudi market capitalization is currently 4.3%, according to Tadawul, and the country would be the ninth-largest emerging market in the world in terms of market cap. If Saudi Arabia were included today, it would have a 2.4% weight in the emerging-markets index, with 32 constituents, according to MSCI.Exotix Partners, an investment firm that focuses on frontier markets, said that would imply an inflow of $12 billion to $24 billion for the Tadawul.MSCI also announced it would delay a decision about whether to remove Nigeria from its indexes until November, to allow more time for international institutional investors to assess the effectiveness of a new foreign-exchange trading window, which gives investors a separate market to trade the country\u2019s currency more freely. Nigeria is currently in MSCI\u2019s frontier-markets index.The Nigerian stock exchange dropped 2.6%.Write to Julie Wernau at Julie.Wernau@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 16:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/are-you-in-or-are-you-out-mscis-index-decisions-swing-stocks-around-the-world-1498075914", "news_title": "Are You In or Are You Out?

I doubt that anyone is watching all these acres of footage, so why should anyone care about being recorded? Won\u2019t the cameras\u2019 ubiquity undermine their effectiveness? \u2014BruceDon\u2019t be so sure. Even if no one is watching the cameras\u2019 video in real time, authorities can still use it after a crime has occurred to figure out who did what to whom. So please don\u2019t start behaving badly just because you\u2019re seeing so many cameras around.Moreover, from a psychological perspective, surveillance cameras also provide a good mechanism for reminding us about morality. One of the most powerful motivators of honest behavior is our own moral self-evaluations (known to experts as \u201cself-concept maintenance\u201d). When we have other people (or cameras) around, they remind us about the people we want to be, which spurs us to behave more nobly.An early demonstration of this principle came from research in 1976 by Edward Diener and Mark Wallbom, published in the Journal of Research in Personality, who showed that mirrors reduced academic dishonesty in students by making them more self-aware. In their experiments, students who took an exam in a room decked out in mirrors were less likely to keep writing after the bell rang than those who took their tests in a normal classroom. Similarly, surveillance cameras\u2014particularly if they\u2019re clearly observable\u2014should increase self-awareness and, with it, better behavior.Dear Dan,My closest friend since childhood recently betrayed me, after decades of trusting friendship. She has apologized sincerely, but all the confidence I had in her is still tainted. Is it rational (or helpful) to forgive people who have hurt us? \u2014JamieWhile it isn\u2019t clear whether your friendship can fully recover from this incident, you clearly would be better off if you could forgive your friend. Research has shown that our health improves when we free up mental space from grudges and hate.In a study published in 2003 in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine, Kathleen A. Lawler and colleagues interviewed 108 college students about a time when a parent or friend had deeply hurt them and measured their blood pressure at several points during the conversation. Subjects who forgave their betrayers had lower levels of blood pressure than those who hadn\u2019t been as lenient. Even more important, college students who had more forgiving personalities overall turned over to have lower blood-pressure levels and heart rates.Of course, forgiveness isn\u2019t easy, but if you can pull it off, it brings real benefits.Dear Dan,I go out to dinner with my husband once a week, and every time, we promise to order something healthy\u2014but when we see the menu, we get tempted and order something less virtuous but tasty. Any advice on how to show more resolve? \u2014AimeeYou are describing a classical case of temptation. Before you get to the restaurant, you\u2019ve settled on a certain idea of how you want to behave\u2014then you get tempted, and afterward, you regret your indulgences. So how can you override temptation? Just order for each other. When we order for our significant other, we aren\u2019t tempted by taste and can instead think about their health\u2014which is also what our spouse would want a few hours later.", "news_time": "2017-06-21 16:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/do-all-those-surveillance-cameras-make-us-behave-better-1498075412", "news_title": "Do All Those Surveillance Cameras Make Us Behave Better?", "keywords": "advice,ask ariely,behavioral economics,dan ariely,forgiveness,surveillance,surveillance cameras,political,general news"}, {"content": "Prices of U.S. government bonds recovered from early losses Wednesday, as further declines in oil prices stoked demand for safer assets.Treasurys began the U.S. trading session on a down note after a top Bank of England official said the central bank should start withdrawing stimulus later this year. Oil prices were also firm to start the day but turned negative by the late morning as traders continued to focus on rising production.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, after reaching 2.177%, settled at 2.156%, compared with 2.153% Tuesday. Yields rise as bond prices fall.Lower oil prices tend to aid Treasury debt in two ways. It can boost their appeal compared to riskier assets, such as stocks. It also eases worries over inflation, which poses a major threat to long-term government bonds by reducing the purchasing power of their fixed payments.Oil prices entered bear market territory Tuesday, having declined 20.6% since Feb. 23.Reflecting lowered inflation expectations, the Treasury debt with the longest time to maturity was a top performer Wednesday, with the yield on the 30-year bond settling at 2.724%, compared with 2.735% Tuesday.If sustained, the decline in oil prices could raise more doubts about the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to continue tightening monetary policy. Already, data showing a softening in inflation has been a big factor in driving down Treasury yields since the 10-year yield reached 2.6% in March.\u201cIf the Fed is thinking about raising rates in September, they\u2019re going to need some better inflation data and the easiest way to get that is with oil starting to turn around,\u201d said Thomas Simons, senior vice president and money-market economist in the Fixed Income Group at Jefferies LLCThe Fed last week raised short-term interest rates for the third time since December and has signaled one more-rate increase by the end of the year. Several officials, including Chairwoman       Janet Yellen,        have suggested inflation should eventually pick up as a tightening labor market leads to higher wages.Meanwhile, other central banks could also be moving closer to tighter policy.In a speech Wednesday, BOE Chief Economist       Andrew Haldane       said the risk of tightening monetary policy too early had declined and the risk of tightening too late had increased as economic growth and inflation in the U.K. had \u201cshown greater resilience than expected.\u201dThe comments sent the yield on the 10-year U.K. bond up around 0.07 percentage point to 1.048% before settling at 1.018%, according to Tradeweb.Bond-buying programs from central banks in Europe and Japan have played a large role in dragging down government bond yields in recent years.

When he reviewed them, he decided he would not use the leadership PAC, called the Great America Committee.It is not clear how Mr. Pence will pay his legal fees, which can be a daunting expense, especially for public officials of relatively limited means.A financial disclosure Mr. Pence released last year appeared to show a negative net worth, not counting his state pension or his residence.

The delay will give the administration more time to complete the rescinding process, the people said.The DHS\u2019s decision isn\u2019t final and still could change, the people cautioned. After filing an official delay, the DHS will open a comment period which could affect the outcome of the rule.\u201cWe cannot speculate on the outcome of the DHS review of the rule. When the review is final, we will make the decision public,\u201d said       Dave Lapan,        a DHS spokesman.The San Francisco Chronicle earlier reported on the possible delay and rescinding of the rule.Closing a potential pathway to citizenship for highly-skilled immigrants could rankle Silicon Valley, which has largely pushed for similar measures and lobbied for President Donald Trump to uphold the entrepreneur role in recent weeks. Entrepreneurs and investors argue that immigrant-founded businesses can create thousands of U.S. jobs and will help boost competitiveness at a time when nations like France and Canada are opening up to foreign startups.But Mr. Trump ran for office on a platform opposing illegal immigration, and there is political pressure on him to shut down various pathways for foreigners.This week, tech-industry leaders made the pilgrimage to the White House for brainstorming sessions despite opposition to many of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, including a plan to temporarily ban travelers from six largely Muslim countries. Chief executives from companies including             Apple Inc.,Microsoft Corp.       and             Alphabet Inc.met with Mr. Trump on Monday, while another group of executives and venture capitalists are scheduled to attend White House meetings on Thursday.Rescinding the entrepreneur rule could further strain Silicon Valley\u2019s relationship with the administration.Critics of the rule say granting a class of immigrants temporary \u201cparole\u201d rather than a visa would create confusion about their status and raise risks around doing business with companies whose roots in the U.S. are uncertain.But the rule has found support across both aisles of Congress, where prominent Republican Senators including Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) and       John McCain       (R., Ariz.) wrote a letter pledging support for the regulation this week.The concept of a startup visa was included in Congress\u2019s 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill, which failed to gain enough votes in the House. Days before his term ran out this past January, President       Barack Obama       signed the International Entrepreneur Rule into law.The rule stipulated that founders would be allowed to live in the U.S. if they showed their business provided public benefit by generating revenue and creating jobs for American workers.Several of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest employers were built by immigrants, including Alphabet\u2019s Google,             Yahoo Inc.       and             Intel Corp.A study last year by the nonpartisan think tank National Foundation for American Policy found that more than half of startups valued at $1 billion or more at the time were founded by immigrants.In recent years, amid stricter immigration policies, entrepreneurs who were denied visas in the U.S. have left to build companies including Snapdeal, an Indian e-commerce valued last year by investors at $6.5 billion.The global competition for startups is heating up. Hundreds of foreign entrepreneurs have moved to Canada in recent years to take advantage of a rebate the country offers to startup businesses. Newly elected French President       Emmanuel Macron       is pushing forward with a French Tech             Visa,       a four-year permanent residence visa for startup founders.In the U.S., startup founders can enter a lottery to receive an H-1B visa or apply for an O-1 visa, which are designated for individuals with extraordinary ability. In the past two years, at least 42 entrepreneurs have also obtained visas through a non-traditional route that involves taking a part-time job at a university, said       Craig Montuori,        the head of a nonprofit group which helps guide that process.Those options were either too risky or too much of a hassle for       Sharoon Thomas,        an Indian-born entrepreneur who decided to move his e-commerce startup from Mountain View, Calif., to Toronto last year after he secured a Canadian startup visa.If the U.S. had offered a startup visa, \u201cI would have absolutely stayed and applied for that,\u201d said Mr. Thomas.Write to Douglas MacMillan at douglas.macmillan@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'Foreign Startup Aid May Be Scuttled.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 15:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-to-rescind-obamas-foreign-born-founder-rule-1498072904", "news_title": "Trump Administration to Rescind Obama\u2019s Foreign-Born Founder Rule ", "keywords": "homeland security,international entrepreneur rule,obama ,obama administration,small business,startup,technology start ups,trump,trump administration,vc regulatory,visas,Department of Homeland Security,Barack Obama,corporate,industrial news,small,medium businesses,political,general news,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Copper prices rose Wednesday, as investors shrugged off a drop in crude to focus on supply issues.Copper for September delivery closed up 1.7%, at $2.6150 a pound, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.World copper mine production declined by around 3.5% in the first quarter, due in part to miners\u2019 strikes in Chile, the world\u2019s largest producer of the metal, the International Copper Study Group said in a Tuesday report.More recent strikes include a work stoppage at             Freeport-McMoRan Inc.\u2019s       Indonesian Grasberg mine, which workers recently voted to extend into July.Meanwhile, stockpiles of copper held at London Metal Exchange registered warehouses fell to their lowest level since early May.\u201cSupply concerns are keeping copper afloat these days,\u201d said       Bob Haberkorn,        a broker at RJO Futures.Investors paid little attention to a 2.3% drop in the price of crude oil.

The dynastic struggle in Saudi Arabia is over, and power\u2014for all practical purposes\u2014is now in the hands of a young generation of princes determined to show the Middle East who\u2019s the boss.Mohammed bin Salman,        appointed\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0as the kingdom\u2019s crown prince and designated successor to his 81-year-old father, King Salman, is the face of bold changes launched by once staid Saudi Arabia in the past two years.At just 31 years of age, he is the architect of the bloody war in Yemen, the initiator of painful economic overhauls, the instigator of moves to aggressively counter Iran and, more recently, the catalyst of a Saudi-led regional campaign to isolate tiny Qatar.His 57-year-old cousin, the now-removed crown prince and interior minister,       Mohammed bin Nayef,        was widely seen as the voice of caution and experience in the kingdom\u2019s halls of power\u2014and a possible check on some of Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s rasher moves.Now that he is gone (and replaced at the interior ministry by a 33-year-old nephew of Mohammed bin Nayef), Saudi Arabia\u2019s regional posture is likely to become even more adventurous.\u201cMohammed bin Salman is much more willing to use Saudi hyper-nationalism as a way to solidify domestic social change,\u201d said       Andrew Bowen,        a specialist on the kingdom at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk when you put a very headstrong, stubborn, impulsive, more nationalist leader in that position compared to Mohammed bin Nayef, who was slow, deliberate and pragmatic.\u201dWhile Mohammed bin Nayef didn\u2019t publicly criticize his young rival, he supported a more traditional Saudi approach of acting behind the scenes and building regional consensus\u2014including in relations with Qatar and Iran.Mohammed bin Salman\u2014who has developed close ties with the activist de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates,       Mohammed bin Zayed      \u2014has by contrast advocated showcasing the kingdom\u2019s military and financial might.\u201cNow you are going to see more decisiveness, be it in the war in Yemen or in the recent disturbance of relations with Qatar. The Saudi foreign policy is going to be more open and more dynamic,\u201d predicted       Ahmad al-Ibrahim,        a Saudi political commentator and businessman.Mohammed bin Nayef, of course, exercised only limited authority outside his internal-security turf in recent months. This means that\u2014despite the consolidation of power in Riyadh\u2014the change in the kingdom\u2019s behavior may be less dramatic than many expect, cautioned Saudi analyst       Mohammed Alyahya,        a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council.\u201cIn terms of foreign policy, economic policy and defense, I don\u2019t foresee a seismic shift because Mohammed bin Salman has already been in charge of these files for quite some time,\u201d Mr. Alyahya said.Indeed, over the past several months, as Mohammed bin Salman widened his authority with the appointment of young princes to key levers of government (including a younger brother as ambassador to Washington), it increasingly seemed just a matter of time before Mohammed bin Nayef was forced out.Yet few expected this time to be so short: As the consensus among Western diplomats in Riyadh went, Mohammed bin Salman needed to show some actual achievements before making the move.With the war in Yemen bogged down, Qatar refusing to capitulate and the House of Saud forced to roll back unpopular austerity measures in April, the only such success has been Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s ability to develop an unexpectedly warm relationship with President       Donald Trump,        who repeatedly bashed the kingdom during last year\u2019s campaign.The prince visited the White House in March, paving the way for last month\u2019s high-pomp Riyadh summit at which Mr. Trump seemed to endorse Saudi claims to lead the entire Muslim world. Shortly thereafter, Saudi Arabia and its allies moved against Qatar\u2014securing, at least at first, Mr. Trump\u2019s backing.On Tuesday, however\u2014just hours before the Saudi leadership shake-up\u2014the U.S. State Department issued an unusually strong rebuke of the Saudi and Emirati embargo on Qatar, which houses a major U.S. military base in the region. To many in the Middle East, this was a signal that Saudi leaders may have been overconfident in their dealings with Washington, too.\u201cI do not see so far that the Trump administration has given the Saudis a blank check,\u201d said       Riad Kahwaji,        CEO of the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis in Dubai. \u201cIt is too early to talk of this as an achievement because we are yet to see what the Trump administration will actually give to the Saudis in the near future.\u201dWrite to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'Shuffle Means a More Activist Saudi Arabia.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 15:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dynastic-reshuffle-means-a-more-activist-saudi-arabia-1498060097", "news_title": "Prince\u2019s Elevation Means a More Activist Saudi Arabia", "keywords": " crown prince, iran, kingdom, middle east, qatar, qatar rift,saudi arabia, saudi crown prince, yemen, yemen war,management,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,political,general news,international relations,politics,energy"}, {"content": "Williamstown, Mass.\u201cPicasso: Encounters,\u201d an intimate exhibition of three oil paintings and 35 prints\u2014many of them masterpieces\u2014at the Clark Art Institute here through Aug. 27, is a splendid sampler of the range of Picasso\u2019s genius as a printmaker. Spanning nearly his entire career, it touches on Picasso\u2019s various periods; on some of his artistic influences; and on a host of Picasso\u2019s themes: biblical stories, classical mythology, the still life, the bullfight, the circus, weeping women, his family and the complex relationship between artist and model. \u201cEncounters\u201d also traces Picasso\u2019s numerous lovers and muses, his art dealers, and some of the artisans who inked the Spanish master\u2019s plates and pulled his prints in the atelier.Picasso: EncountersClark Art Institute  Through Aug. 27If you\u2019re wondering if all this might be a little too ambitious for an exhibition of only 38 pictures, you\u2019d be correct. This underdeveloped show with the aspirations of a full-dress retrospective might really begin to flourish with 200 to 400 works across all media. But \u201cEncounters\u201d is not just about Picasso\u2019s art\u2014specifically his large-scale prints. Its core subject is the meaningful and nurturing \u201cencounters\u201d Picasso had with others in and around the studio.Organized by       Jay A. Clarke,        curator of prints, drawings and photographs at the Clark, \u201cEncounters\u201d first acknowledges Picasso as an undisputable artistic genius\u2014and then gets down to the business of challenging that very notion. The show shifts us away from Picasso at center stage as \u201cthe maestro, the conductor of his universe,\u201d the \u201cartist-god creator,\u201d to focus our attention on the supporting players: the muses, dealers, Old Masters and artisans. It posits that even the visionary, revolutionary Picasso didn\u2019t exist in a vacuum.True, Picasso, with a voracious eye, consistently devoured, mined and reinvented the art of the past, and he was obsessed with a host of successive and sometimes overlapping lovers who inspired his art. Besides prints\u2014often commissioned by his dealers\u2014Picasso worked on collaborative projects, including books, ceramics, sculptures and designs for the stage. He collaborated so closely with       Georges Braque       while they pioneered Cubism that he famously likened the experience to two mountain climbers, tied together, scaling new peaks.Arranged chronologically and thematically, \u201cEncounters\u201d begins with \u201cSelf-Portrait\u201d (1901), a Blue Period oil in which the artist\u2019s body rises like a black mountain against a Prussian-blue sky, and his head gleams like a moonlit, snowcapped peak\u2014a painting meant to establish the myth of Picasso going it alone. Next is \u201cThe Frugal Repast\u201d (1904), a moody etching of a gaunt couple in a caf\u00e9. Among the artist\u2019s first prints, it is unusual in that it was created by Picasso on a scraped-down plate used earlier by another artist; and also because of its heavy application of ink by the headstrong artist-printmaker Eug\u00e8ne Del\u00e2tre, who wouldn\u2019t allow Picasso into his printing studio, and whose version didn\u2019t garner Picasso\u2019s approval.Further on is the smudgy, strange woodcut \u201cBust of a Young Woman (Fernande Olivier)\u201d (1906; printed 1933). One of the few known prints Picasso actually inked and pulled, it is faint and blotchy, resembling a rubbing or the facial imprint from a funeral shroud. Nearby is the crystalline drypoint \u201cStill Life With Bottle of Marc\u201d (1912). Among scant Cubist-era prints, it was commissioned by Picasso\u2019s dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, \u201cprobably,\u201d according to Ms. Clarke, \u201cto market Picasso to a wider audience.\u201dMany pictures here are magnificently rich dialogues with other artists. Two prints from \u201cThe Vollard Suite\u201d (both printed 1939)\u2014a monumental cycle of 100 black-and-white etchings commissioned by Picasso\u2019s first dealer, Ambroise Vollard\u2014channel       Ingres       and       Rembrandt,        respectively. They also feature Picasso\u2019s beautiful young muse       Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter.       In \u201cVenus and Cupid, After Cranach\u201d (1949 and 1951), \u201cLuncheon on the Grass, After       Manet      \u201d (1968) and \u201cEcce Homo, After Rembrandt\u201d (1970; printed 1975-77) Picasso immerses himself in and then completely reimagines these masters. His \u201cPortrait of a Young Girl, After Cranach the Younger, II\u201d (1958) feels equally German and Spanish, old-world and new, as if Picasso were seeing Cranach through the eyes of a modern-day       Vel\u00e1zquezParticularly captivating and surprising is \u201cThe Italian Woman (After the Painting by Victor Orsel)\u201d (1953; printed 1955), in which Picasso reworked a photographic reproduction of Orsel\u2019s straightforward 19th-century portrait on a discarded zinc plate, converting \u201cThe Italian Woman\u201d into a portrait of Picasso\u2019s second wife,       Jacqueline Roque.       Picasso added a nude woman, a satyr and a self-portrait-cum-Greek-god to the portrait\u2019s margins. It pays homage, seemingly, not only to Orsel and Roque but to Greco-Roman art, medieval manuscripts, the women painted by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and, finally, to the genius of the art-god creator Picasso.\u201cEncounters\u201d is a remarkable introduction to the significance and breadth of Picasso\u2019s creative influences and inspirations.

But the Swedish Air Force didn\u2019t use its own crews and aircraft to play the red side, leaving that role to the Finnish Air Force. Sweden and Finland are integrating their armed forces, and the burden-sharing goes far beyond playing the enemy in exercises. It\u2019s a better model for efficient defense than an EU army.Europe\u2019s militaries are notoriously wasteful and woefully underfunded. The European Union\u2019s member states spend an average of 1.3% of gross domestic product on defense, compared to 3.6% by the U.S. EU members also have a multitude of weaponry, but it suffers from enormous disarray: There are 177 weapons systems among members, while the U.S. only has 30. \u201cWe Europeans spend on defense,\u201d observed       George Robertson,        the former NATO Secretary-General and U.K. Defense Secretary. \u201cWe just need to spend more wisely.\u201dEarlier this month, the European Commission announced a \u20ac5.5 billion ($6.13 billion) defense fund that will coordinate defense-research investments. The commission\u2019s president,       Jean-Claude Juncker,        has gone further, proposing that the EU integrate its armed forces. This week EU leaders will meet to discuss a more-modest version of that concept: joint military missions, use of EU battle groups and an EU pool of helicopters.Their modesty is understandable: An alliance that operates 177 weapons systems would struggle to integrate even small sections of its armed forces. Add to that some members\u2019 skepticism of anything resembling an EU army.But European countries can no longer ignore their inefficiencies. \u201cWe have big shortages of deployable troops and available planes,\u201d Mr. Robertson said. \u201cThat won\u2019t be solved through new battle groups.\u201dSweden and Finland-style integration would be a much more viable solution. Discussions between the two countries began a decade ago but sped up after Russia seized Crimea. The two air forces are in the process of integrating, and the navies have established a task group.Each country can use the other\u2019s exercise ranges and landing fields, and troops may be commanded by officers from the other side. \u201cThis is making our armed forces more effective while using the same amount of resources,\u201d said       Niklas Granholm,        a Swedish defense analyst. Bilateral integration saves money by maximizing capabilities.While no modern country pairing has gone as far as Sweden and Finland, Belgium and the Netherlands operate a joint navy. \u201cWhen operating the ships, it means you\u2019re 100% interoperable and standardized,\u201d said Dick Zandee, a former head of policy and planning at the European Defense Agency who is now a senior fellow at Clingendael, the Netherlands Institute of International Relations. \u201cIn theory, you can even swap crews.\u201dThe Belgians and the Dutch have already bought minehunters and frigates together without insisting on national specifications, a consistent headache in multinational acquisitions. And the two countries depend on each other for training and maintenance. France and the U.K., meanwhile, are seven years into a bilateral agreement that includes a joint expeditionary force.Other European countries could adopt the Swedish-Finnish model, but the challenge is national prestige: It takes a certain amount of humility for decision makers to give up some control in exchange for added capabilities. Success also requires a history of armed-forces collaboration, including joint exercises. And as retired Gen.       Vincenzo Camporini,        an Italian former chief of defense, points out, military integration requires a common foreign policy.But for countries that have enjoyed many years of close relations and have similar equipment, armed-forces integration can be a highly practical solution. A combined Czech and Slovak air force would, for example, multiply the two neighbors\u2019 power. Lithuania could maximize its capabilities by integrating parts of its armed forces with Poland, while Poland would gain well-trained troops.Countries could also team up with the existing pairs. Mr. Camporini suggests a limited geographical focus as another starting point. The Franco-German led operation in Mali could expand into an EU African command, he says. Starting small works in the military, too.Joint acquisitions could also advance integration. Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and the U.K. are buying the F-35 joint strike fighter. If these countries can break the bad habit of insisting on national variations, it would go a long way toward building a partly integrated air force. Collective decision making is tricky, but a partially integrated air force would give each country more value for its investment.There\u2019s another reason the time is ripe for bottom-up European armed-forces integration. Two generations ago, few troops were fluent in another language. Today almost every officer speaks English.

But there could be complications.The Federal Reserve will reveal on Thursday which of the 34 banks it tests have passed hypothetical negative scenarios while maintaining required capital levels. Then next week it will say whether it has approved their plans to return capital to shareholders, a higher bar.Last year every bank subject to the test passed, and all but two got the nod for their capital payouts. Investors expect another positive outcome this year. Going into the tests, banks over all have higher capital levels and better earnings prospects than last year. Analysts figure that             Citigroup        C -0.28%       and             Morgan Stanley        MS 3.28%       could be in a position for the first time to pay out more than 100% of their projected profits.Compared with last year, this year\u2019s test assumes a slightly more severe domestic recession. Notably, it features a sharper decline in commercial real-estate prices\u201435% versus 30% in last year\u2019s tests. Multifamily properties are assumed to suffer even bigger declines.This means regional lenders with big commercial real-estate portfolios are probably at greater risk of failing. In a report, analysts at             Goldman Sachs        GS -0.20%       pointed to Key Bank,             M&T Bank        MTB -1.81%       and             Zions Bancorp        ZION -0.23%       as having the highest ratios of commercial real-estate exposure to risk capital.For investors, the more important results will be next week when the Fed says how much capital banks can pay out. In an era of slow growth and low rates, bigger dividends and stock buybacks would be important drivers of bank shares. Even if these regional lenders do pass the first round of the stress tests, and that is likely, if their capital levels come close to regulatory minimums in the ugly scenarios, the banks may scale back their payout requests. That could hurt their stocks.Some investors are also concerned that             Wells Fargo        WFC 0.26%       could have its return plan denied on \u201cqualitative\u201d grounds as part of the extended fallout from last year\u2019s account-sales fiasco. But Goldman\u2019s analysts figure this is unlikely given the amount of work the bank has done to reform its sales practices.The most likely scenario is still that banks will pass this year\u2019s tests easily.

The former Georgia secretary of state beat Mr. Ossoff, a former congressional aide, by 3.7 points; Mr. Trump won the district in November by 1.5 points.Still, the fact that Republicans had to spend so much\u2014see below\u2014to hold on to a seat in the party\u2019s hands for nearly four decades signals to GOP incumbents and candidates that they likely will have a tougher fight than usual next year, when they will have to defend far more seats.2: Too close for comfort?Former House Speaker       Newt Gingrich       took this district, whose boundaries have shifted over the years, out of Democratic hands in 1978. Since then it has passed on to three other Republicans, including Ms. Handel.Ms. Handel\u2019s case was the narrowest baton pass of the district\u2019s post-Gingrich era. When now-Sen.       Johnny Isakson       chose not to run for re-election to the House seat in 2004,       Tom Price,        then a member of the Georgia state senate, ran unopposed and won 100% of the vote. In November, Mr. Price won re-election to his seventh term in November by 24 points.Here\u2019s a comparison of Ms. Handel\u2019s race to previous elections in which no incumbent was on the ballot:3. The money raceThe race was the most expensive House election in American history, with both candidates pulling in big money in their own campaign coffers as well as help from supportive groups. Mr. Ossoff received more of his money from individual contributions to his campaign while Ms. Handel benefited more than her opponent from outside groups\u2019 contributions.4. Voters turnout was way upThe total number of votes cast Tuesday was up 23% from the 2014 midterms. Mr. Ossoff received far more votes than the Democratic challenger to Mr. Price did in 2014, while Ms. Handel received 3.2% fewer votes than Mr. Price did in 2014.The narrowing since 2014 could portend the district will be more competitive in future races, though if Ms. Handel seeks re-election, she will have the advantage of being an incumbent.", "news_time": "2017-06-21 14:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-georgia-special-election-in-4-charts-1498071475", "news_title": "The Georgia Special Election in 4 Charts", "keywords": "georgia house race,house republicans,jon ossoff,karen handel,special election,Jon Ossoff,Karen Handel,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "I do watch TV\u2014perhaps more than I should.

A companion bill in the Senate hasn\u2019t yet been taken up by the Senate Finance Committee.Already years behind, the timetable for bringing Southern\u2019s Vogtle nuclear project online was further delayed after Westinghouse, the main engineering contractor, sought bankruptcy protection earlier this year.A Southern executive told Georgia regulators last month that the previously announced in-service dates of December 2019 and September 2020 for the twin Vogtle reactors were \u201cno longer achievable\u201d in light of the bankruptcy. The chapter 11 also affected another dual-reactor project that Westinghouse is under contract to build in South Carolina, which could also benefit from the tax-credit extension.Scana Corp.      , a part-owner of those units, last month pushed back their completion dates until April 2020 and December 2020. That wouldn\u2019t leave Scana much wiggle room under current law, unless Congress extends the deadline.\u201cAs every business owner knows, the unexpected happens in the real world,\u201d Rep. Rick Allen (R., Ga.) said on the House floor. \u201cWe cannot send a signal to the rest of the world that non-democratic countries are leading the way in nuclear production and that America is not investing in our own energy independence.\u201dStarted in 2008, the Vogtle project is only 42% built, several years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. Westinghouse\u2019s bankruptcy was designed in part to shield Toshiba from responsibility for those overruns, although the parent recently reached a deal with Southern to contribute $3.7 billion toward the project\u2019s completion. Southern agreed not to ask for more, even if the project continues to run over budget.Toshiba and Southern have been negotiating the continuing costs and responsibilities since late March, when Westinghouse Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection. The U.S. unit was struggling financially because of billions of dollars in losses from the Vogtle facility and the other half-finished project, the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina. Toshiba has said it is working on a similar agreement with Scana to cap its liabilities there.But it still isn\u2019t clear that either project will be completed since state regulators will need to be convinced that continuing work makes economic sense for electricity ratepayers. An alternative in Georgia is to abandon construction of the Vogtle facility and build an equivalent amount of natural gas-fired generation, assuming gas prices remain low.After Westinghouse sought bankruptcy protection, Southern stepped in to continue paying the 6,000 workers at the site. Westinghouse was building the plant for Southern on a fixed-cost contract but stopped covering ongoing costs after seeking court protection. Southern owns 47.5% of the project with the rest split between Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and City of Dalton Utilities.\u2014Russell Gold contributed to this article.Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 14:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nuclear-plant-tax-credit-extension-gets-white-house-support-1498071065", "news_title": "Nuclear Plant Tax-Credit Extension Gets White House Support ", "keywords": "bankruptcy,construction,nuclear plant,reactor,southern co.,tax-credit extension,vogtle,white house,Toshiba,6502.TO,Westinghouse Electric,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,energy,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,nuclear power generation,computers,consumer electronics,personal electronics,heavy construction,power station construction,technical services,business,consumer services,real estate,electric utilities,technology,utilities"}, {"content": "Comfort is king.

Chief Executive Travis Kalanick may do little immediately to alleviate the scrutiny the car-hailing company has attracted over its hard-driving image around the world.Uber for years has faced opposition in the U.S. and abroad from taxi companies, regulators and\u2014increasingly\u2014its own disgruntled drivers, who argue that the company co-founded by Mr. Kalanick is a scofflaw that rolls into countries and tries to gain market share while flouting local regulations.Uber counters that it is mainly the victim of lobbying by taxi monopolies that take advantage of riders and drivers, forcing Uber into the courtroom to push back.That has left it embroiled in multiple legal battles, particularly in Europe, where Uber has been forced to shut down at least some services in\u00a0France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden and other countries\u2014sometimes only after a court order.Those legal fights, many initiated by Uber to challenge laws that restrict it, won\u2019t go away just because Mr. Kalanick is no longer CEO. An official for the European Union\u2019s executive arm said that Mr. Kalanick\u2019s resignation will have no impact, for instance, on a set of appeals it has made in Europe. The complaints \u201cconcern the application of EU law and not the management of companies concerned,\u201d the EU official said.Nor are some of those Mr. Kalanick offended ready to forgive the company he founded until it changes its ways. British independent-workers union IWGB welcomed Mr. Kalanick\u2019s resignation, but said the company must start giving drivers more benefits. Driver groups in other countries echoed the sentiment.\u201cWe saw how Travis treated his drivers,\u201d said Sayah Baaroun, head of a driver\u2019s union in France, referring to an incident where Mr. Kalanick was videotaped arguing with an Uber driver. \u201cBut for us, the larger battle continues.\u201d Mr. Kalanick later said he was \u201cashamed\u201d of the behavior captured on the video.Still, Uber\u2019s aggressiveness around the world has often been viewed as interlinked with Mr. Kalanick\u2019s own personality, and the change of leadership could offer a fresh start with some of the authorities with which Uber has tangled. Dave Ashton, co-founder of French car-booking app SnapCar, said Mr. Kalanick\u2019s departure is \u201can astute move by the board\u201d that could \u201crepair Uber\u2019s reputation and help the company mature.\u201dXiaofeng Wang, an analyst with research firm Forrester in Singapore, said Mr. Kalanick\u2019s resignation \u201chelps a little bit,\u201d she said, since it shows they \u201cactually want to take responsibility and change.\u201dIn Asia, Uber faces a clutch of fast-growing, homegrown startups that are capitalizing on factors such as local knowledge and better relationships with regulators in the battle for ride-hailing turf. Singapore-based startup GrabTaxi Holdings Pte. and Indonesia\u2019s Go-Jek, a motorcycle-hailing app, are both providing fierce competition in Southeast Asia, where Uber has said it would focus\u2014along with India\u2014after abandoning the China market.In Hong Kong, where local taxis have a tight grip on the passenger-ferrying market, police arrested several Uber drivers in May for allegedly running afoul of the city\u2019s permitting and insurance rules. A spokesman said the company is hopeful Hong Kong\u2019s new chief executive will be more open to the service.An Uber spokeswoman said Mr. Kalanick\u2019s departure won\u2019t affect the company\u2019s efforts to join with regulators and cities globally. She added that Uber already is making changes to how it works separately from Mr. Kalanick\u2019s resignation, including an announcement this week that it will start implementing changes drivers have asked for, such as allowing riders to tip drivers.One of Uber\u2019s most significant legal battles has already been heard before the European Court of Justice, the EU\u2019s top court. In that case, Uber has argued that it is a tech company, not a transport company, and as such it shouldn\u2019t be subject to certain national transportation and taxi laws that have been used to ban its services in European countries.A court adviser has recommended that it treat Uber as a transportation company, which would block one of Uber\u2019s easiest ways to sidestep regulatory battles; a final decision is due later this year.The company has notched some victories. In May, a Rome court allowed Uber to continue providing service in Italy, revoking a shutdown order.Uber has its share of troubles too back home in the U.S.The company is facing a criminal investigation over a software tool it used in a program called \u201cGreyball\u201d to thwart sting operations on its drivers. As part of the investigation, the Justice Department has subpoenaed local governments in Portland, Ore.; Austin, Texas; and Philadelphia, according to officials in those cities.

The firm made the announcement Wednesday after The Wall Street Journal reported the move.The company and other big accounting firms are partnerships that generally have governing boards made up of their own personnel, unlike public companies that trade on major exchanges, which are required to have a majority of directors who have no connection to the company.PwC said the move to enhance its governance isn\u2019t related to its snafu at the Academy Awards in February. At the event, the wrong film was announced as the best-picture winner because a PwC partner gave a presenter the wrong envelope.The board move was in the works long before that, said       Tim Ryan,        the firm\u2019s U.S. chairman. He said       Brian Cullinan,        the partner behind the Oscar mistake, was and remains on PwC\u2019s board.PwC decided to add outside board members to get more diverse perspectives on its business and avoid groupthink, Mr. Ryan said in an interview. The move also aligns PwC more with the requirements its audit clients face, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the logical thing to do,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big message that we are open to hearing different points of view.\u201dSome have recommended in the past that accounting firms have independent directors. In 2008, a Treasury Department advisory committee on auditing said such a move \u201ccould improve investor protection through enhanced audit quality and firm transparency.\u201dMore recently,       Steve Harris,        a member of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the U.S. government\u2019s auditing regulator, advocated the idea in a speech last month, saying independent directors represent \u201cbasic sound governance practice.\u201dMs. Pottenger was with the Navy for 36 years, serving in command positions at every level; she was the first female admiral to command a strike group. She \u201cwill help us immensely\u201d with the risk and government security aspects of PwC\u2019s business, Mr. Ryan said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to bring a perspective that we have not seen before.\u201dMr. Gutierrez was CEO of Kellogg from 1999 to 2005 and commerce secretary from 2005 to 2009. He is co-chairman of Albright Stonebridge Group, a global strategy and commercial diplomacy firm. He \u201cunderstands the risks associated with global business and government,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.The new board members will join the board July 1, bringing the board\u2019s size to 22 members.

His influence soared when his father became king in early 2015. He then set about leading an ambitious economic overhaul to reduce the kingdom\u2019s dependence on oil and to usher in a more muscular Saudi foreign policy in the region.Prince Mohammed bin Salman replaces       Prince Mohammed bin Nayef,        a nephew of the king, who was stripped of all his posts, including interior minister. His ouster effectively ends the political career of a royal who was one of Washington\u2019s most trusted partners in fighting terrorism and was widely praised for combating the threat from al Qaeda in the kingdom.President       Donald Trump       in a phone call with Prince Mohammed bin Salman Wednesday congratulated him and discussed the \u201cpriority\u201d of ending support for terrorism and how to resolve the political crisis pitting Saudi Arabia against Qatar, according to a White House statement about the call.The two also discussed how to reach \u201ca lasting peace\u201d between Israel and the Palestinians, the statement said.       Jared Kushner,        a top adviser and son-in-law to Mr. Trump, is in Israel to meet with Prime Minister       Benjamin Netanyahu       on the same subject. Mr. Kushner will also meet with Palestinian Authority President       Mahmoud Abbas       and his senior advisers in the West Bank city of Ramallah.As next in line to the throne, Prince Mohammed bin Salman could become a rarity: a young Saudi king. The 81-year-old King Salman and his predecessors have taken power as septuagenarians or octogenarians, with little inclination for robust changes or time to implement them.\u201cThe benefit now is that we have young leader who has the authority to\u2026plan not 10 years in advance but 40 years in advance and ensure there is institutional continuity going forward,\u201d said       Mohammed Alyahya,        a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington.But while Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s ascension signals a generational shift\u2014one that makes the monarchy more reflective of the country\u2019s burgeoning youth population\u2014it also risks a backlash within the vast House of Saud.For much of Saudi Arabia\u2019s existence as a nation, the extended families and clans that make up the kingdom\u2019s ruling royal family have ruled through consensus. In recent years, however, that has given way to more jockeying for power, influence and wealth as the number of       royals       has expanded.Kristian Ulrichsen,        a Middle East expert at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy, said the crown prince\u2019s success depends on the support he receives from the wider Al Saud family, especially if some of the economic reforms he has sponsored prove controversial.\u201cMohammed bin Salman\u2019s elevation to crown prince has been on the cards for a while, but still represents an enormous shake-up in Saudi succession dynamics,\u201d he said.Wednesday\u2019s appointment wasn\u2019t the first time that King Salman had tinkered with the traditional lines of succession.One of his first acts as monarch was to remove a half-brother as his heir and to appoint two younger princes in the line of succession\u2014Prince       Mohammed bin Nayef       and Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2014a change that shocked many royals but was accepted because of the close ties he had cultivated with other members of his extended family over the years.Still, by appointing his own son as his successor, the 81-year-old King Salman overturns decades of royal tradition. Since the reign of       King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud,        the founder of the modern Saudi state who came to power in 1932, the throne has passed from brother to brother among his sons.The upending of the line of succession was endorsed by 31 out of 34 members of the Allegiance Council, a senior Saudi official at the royal court said. The council is composed of senior princes who advise the king on matters of succession.In a display of royal unity, state television on Wednesday broadcast footage of Mohammed bin Nayef pledging allegiance to his successor. The video showed Prince Mohammed bin Salman kneeling down and kissing the hands of Mohammed bin Nayef, who told his cousin: \u201cMay God help you.\u201dThe royal shake-up coincides with a political crisis in the Persian Gulf that pits Saudi Arabia and its allies against Qatar. Saudi Arabia is also entangled in a continuing war in neighboring Yemen and is challenging rival Iran for regional sway.Since following his father into power, Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been the public face of change in the kingdom.He has introduced austerity measures\u2014some of which were reversed later\u2014to help reduce a budget deficit caused by the drop in oil prices. He has also backed the potential listing next year of state oil giant Saudi Aramco, in part to push the economy toward privatization and greater competitiveness needed to generate jobs for the young and attract foreign investment beyond the oil sector.The economic pressures have precipitated broader social changes. Long an ultraconservative society where women still can\u2019t drive, Saudi Arabia is now embracing significant cultural reforms, staging public concerts and is set to open its first movie theaters, once opposed by the religious establishment.Some senior officials say the succession move is a sign of other big changes to come.\u201cIt is a highly calculated move to make Saudi Arabia as stable as possible,\u201d said another senior Saudi official. \u201cYou need this clarity when you have a big ambitious reform plan you want to achieve,\u201dSome critics have portrayed the new crown prince as reckless. Saudi Arabia\u2019s intervention in Yemen has cost billions of dollars, killed thousands of civilians and so far failed to oust Houthi rebels from the country\u2019s capital. And for all the talk of an economic overhaul, the country\u2019s economy continues to depend overwhelmingly on oil revenues. Economic growth and job creation, especially among the young, remains lackluster.As Prince Mohammed bin Salman amasses more power, his youth is both an asset and a potential liability, some Saudis say.\u201cI admire his energy,\u201d said a Saudi close to a powerful line of the family. \u201cBut at the same time it worries me and worries many Saudis that he is overconfident.\u201dStill, the new crown prince has taken on the role of prying open the kingdom after decades of isolation and stagnation.To attract more foreign capital to Saudi Arabia and explore investments overseas, he has met heads of state and global business leaders such as             Facebook\u2019s      Mark Zuckerberg.       In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund agreed with Japan\u2019s SoftBank to launch a $100 billion fund that will invest in technology companies.\u2014       Maria Abi-Habib       in Beirut and Rebecca Ballhaus in Washington contributed to this article.Write to Nicolas Parasie at nicolas.parasie@wsj.com, Margherita Stancati at margherita.stancati@wsj.com and Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'Saudi King Advances Son in Shake-Up.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 14:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-king-salman-ousts-nephew-as-crown-prince-installs-son-1498018510", "news_title": "Saudi King Salman Ousts Nephew as Crown Prince, Installs Son", "keywords": "mohammed bin nayef,mohammed bin salman,saudi arabia crown prince ,saudi arabia intrigue ,saudi arabia palace intrigue ,saudi arabia politics ,King Salman,Mohammed bin Nayef,Mohammed bin Salman,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,royal families,terrorism,energy"}, {"content": "A leading House lawmaker said Wednesday he would introduce a bill to take management of U.S. airspace away from the Federal Aviation Administration.Rep.       Bill Shuster       (R., Pa.), who leads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said his bill would extend the FAA\u2019s general mandate for six years but move air-traffic control functions to a not-for-profit federal corporation over three years.The bill, which Mr. Shuster said he hopes to bring to the House floor next month, improves on a version he introduced last year that never reached the floor. Mr. Shuster said this version has \u201cincreased support across the spectrum,\u201d including from President       Donald Trump       and more aviation industry stakeholders.The Trump administration has made air-traffic privatization the centerpiece of its planned infrastructure build-out. Transportation Secretary       Elaine Chao       testified in support of the plan before Congress earlier this month.Mr. Shuster said the Sept. 30 expiration of the FAA\u2019s current mandate puts pressure on legislators to act quickly.But the plan still faces deep skepticism from some corners of the aviation industry and on Capitol Hill, where Democrats widely oppose it and Republicans are concerned about its impact in rural airports. The large community of private pilots has also raised concerns that the fees they pay for using the airspace would rise.Rep. Shuster said private pilots of small planes would be exempt from paying user fees. Small airports will still have access to federal funding for safety and equipment projects, and the ability to use contractors to staff their airport towers. The FAA will be the safety organization overseeing the new air-traffic service provider, he said.The new agency would be headed by a 13-member board of directors including representatives from the Transportation Department, major airlines, regional carriers, private pilots, other aviation companies and unions representing existing FAA controllers and pilots.\u201cNo one group can dominate,\u201d the new corporation Mr. Shuster said.The FAA\u2019s efforts to modernize its air-traffic control systems would become the responsibility of the new entity.

Where the money comes from. The high-speed intercity line is privately funded, built and operated. None of the $1.3 billion cost of the first phase of the operation\u2014laying track and building bridges, stations and complete trains\u2014is coming out of taxpayers\u2019 pockets. The only government involvement is that the project has permission to sell tax-exempt bonds to fund part of the project through a state agency.Government planners and companies are watching the project closely. For some, the funding structure could show a way forward for cities, states and counties looking to ease roadway congestion and help reduce carbon emissions without putting a heavy squeeze on taxpayers. But there have been obstacles that may make other cities wary of this kind of undertaking. The project has faced legal challenges, and some activists, claiming the train will disrupt south Florida\u2019s quality of life, still have concerns about some parts of the plan. And not every locale will have access to developers like those behind Brightline, which already owns a network of tracks.But there is little doubt that how this shakes out could have a profound effect on what happens to rail next. \u201cOnce some organization demonstrates that there is value to be generated by [high-speed rail], just like Ford did with the horseless carriage, then others will be bound to follow,\u201d says Anthony Perl, a professor of urban studies and political science at Simon Fraser University and a former director of VIA Rail Canada, the Canadian equivalent of Amtrak.He is sanguine about Brightline\u2019s chances. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many initiatives come and go, but none have been put forward by an organization that owns the infrastructure, and that puts Brightline in a class by itself,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as there is not some big shock to the global financial markets or another wild card, I\u2019m optimistic.\u201dThe groundwork for Brightline\u2014whose formal name is All Aboard Florida\u2014was laid over a century ago by Henry Flagler, a co-founder of Standard Oil. Mr. Flagler built a network of rails for passenger and freight trains in Florida with his company, Florida East Coast Railway, which has since been split into two firms, Florida East Coast Industries and Florida East Coast Railway, owned by Fortress Investment Group.For phase one of the project, Brightline is laying new rail next to existing freight tracks between Miami and West Palm Beach and updating the signal infrastructure along the whole route. The train is scheduled to start running from West Palm Beach to Fort Lauderdale late this summer, followed by a fall extension to Miami. A second phase of the project, connecting the line to Orlando, is due to open in 2019.Ticket prices have yet to be set, but should compete with the cost of driving, says Brightline CEO Dave Howard. The top speed will be 125 miles an hour, and travel time between cities is likely to be much faster than going by car: The ride between Miami and Orlando, for instance, will likely be three hours, compared with four to five by car.Brightline\u2019s operators and designers are stressing the differences between their project and other intercity rail lines. For one thing, the tracks run through city centers, as opposed to the outskirts of town, and Florida East Coast Industries and other developers are putting up buildings around the stations.The West Palm Beach station, for example, sits between City Place, a retail and entertainment village, and downtown. Two apartment buildings\u2014one with 315 units, the other with 290\u2014are planned to rise adjacent to the station.John Renne, director of the Center for Urban and Environmental Solutions at Florida Atlantic University, sees Brightline as an example of the potential for integrating transit into the fabric of urban centers.\u201cThe typical model we\u2019ve been following is that the government builds the transit service and development is disconnected to the train stations,\u201d says Mr. Renne, who is also managing director of the TOD Group, a private real-estate investment and master-development firm, which didn\u2019t work on Brightline. The Florida project \u201cis integrating development into the station, which drives desirability and ridership.\u201dAssuming Brightline is successful, he adds, \u201cmany freight-rail companies will take notice as a way to generate new income from existing assets.\u201d (Grupo Mexico is in talks to purchase Florida East Coast Railway, but Brightline has an agreement in place to operate passenger rail within the existing rail corridor in perpetuity.)The project\u2019s developers are also trying to add amenities to the trains that other lines don\u2019t have. Siemens Rolling Stock, North America\u2014which designed and built the train cars\u2014added wider aisles, a gap-filler so that passengers can roll luggage, strollers or wheelchairs directly onto the platform, and completely touchless bathrooms, among other things.Meanwhile, architect       David Rockwell,        whose firm Rockwell Group has created hotels, playgrounds, nightclubs and the stage set for Broadway\u2019s \u201cKinky Boots,\u201d gave some cars more than the typical two groups of four seats \u201cto allow for more social activity,\u201d while a designated retail car will offer healthy food choices when phase two of the project is completed. Overhead storage is transparent, and there are plenty of racks for bikes. Mr. Rockwell\u2019s proudest achievement, he says, is the tray tables that unfold to triple in size so food and computers don\u2019t have to compete for space.Mr. Renne thinks there is big potential for other freight-line owners to follow the Brightline model \u201cof investing in their corridors to combine freight with passenger service,\u201d he says. \u201cFreight-rail companies could become private transit providers over the next several decades, offering passengers options including high-speed rail, commuter rail and local urban rail.\u201dOf course, many other experts say most freight companies aren\u2019t interested in offering passenger service currently and have had a fraught relationship at times with Amtrak\u2019s passenger rail. And Brightline has faced legal hurdles.In 2015, a pair of civil lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court by Indian River and Martin counties sought to challenge a decision by the U.S. Transportation Department to allocate as much as $1.75 billion in nontaxable private-activity bonds to help finance the project, arguing that the project would have an adverse environmental impact.The judge later dismissed the suits because the Transportation Department withdrew the original $1.75 billion allocation and Brightline was awarded a new allocation\u2014$600 million\u2014for a part of the project that didn\u2019t affect the two counties.In a separate case, an administrative law judge denied a petition challenging Brightline\u2019s environmental permit for lack of evidence; brought by the Indian River Farms Water Control District, the suit sought to shut down construction, arguing that Brightline\u2019s new canal-spanning bridges would increase flooding risk. And some citizen groups in Martin, Indian River and St. Lucie counties have made public complaints about the project\u2019s safety, noise and other issues.Brightline says the project had to go through a multiyear environmental study led by the Federal Railroad Administration, which issued a final statement in August 2015 concluding that there would be no significant environmental impact from the infrastructure and that any potential impact was sufficiently mitigated.Brightline says it met with stakeholders, including multiple federal, state and local agencies, as well as homeowners associations, chambers of commerce and citizens so they could provide input before a shovel was put in the ground. New tracks, new signals and positive train control, designed to stop trains automatically in certain conditions, were put in place to enhance safety beyond baseline government regulations. Brightline is also working with local communities to create quiet zones that are meant to enhance the quality of life for people living near the track.In West Palm Beach, Mayor Jeri Muoio wasn\u2019t initially a fan because the station would block east-west passage of her city\u2019s 108,000 residents. Through some negotiations for a \u201cquiet zone\u201d and design tweaks, Mayor Muoio was won over. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing more businesses coming up from Fort Lauderdale because West Palm Beach has all the culture and opportunities without the hassle of a bigger city,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we\u2019ll soon see expansion from south of us as a result. This could be a real economic driver.\u201dMs. Mitchell is a writer in Chicago.

Having fallen short of a majority, her Conservative Party will require support from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party to pass legislation. After days of discussion the two parties haven\u2019t reached an agreement, but talks are continuing.Mrs. May\u00a0said earlier that while the election result wasn\u2019t one she had hoped for, she would respond with \u201chumility and resolve\u201d to the message the electorate sent her government.\u201cWe will work hard every day to gain the trust and confidence of the British people, making their priorities our priorities,\u201d Mrs. May said.Jeremy Corbyn,        leader of the main opposition Labour Party, speaking in Parliament, called the Conservatives\u2019 agenda thin and disappointing.\u201cThis is a government without a majority, without a mandate, without a serious legislative program, led by a prime minister who has lost her political authority and is struggling to stitch together a deal to stay in office,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said. \u201cWe will use every opportunity to vote down government policies that failed to win public support and we will use every opportunity to win support for our program.\u201dTo continue as prime minister, Mrs. May will need a majority of Parliament\u2019s 650 lawmakers to approve the agenda laid out in the Queen\u2019s Speech. Parliament is expected to give Mrs. May only a narrow win in a vote next Thursday, suggesting she will likely face difficulties ahead in running a minority government, which are rarities in the U.K. and have tended to be short-lived.To stay in power, Mrs. May\u2019s government will have to rely on cooperation from other parties to pass legislation. Without official support from the DUP, this is unlikely to work in the long term, particularly at a moment of historic change for a country deeply divided over what its new relationship with the EU should look like. Mrs. May can remain prime minister until she loses a confidence motion or a major finance vote in the House of Commons, with the first test coming with next Thursday\u2019s vote.Wednesday\u2019s ceremony had less pomp than usual. The need for hasty arrangements for opening Parliament after the snap election, along with the queen\u2019s lavish birthday celebration just days ago, led Buckingham Palace to tone down arrangements. For the first time since March 1974\u2014the last time a minority government took office in Britain\u2014the queen traveled to Parliament in a car rather than in a royal carriage; she wore a day dress, rather than traditional formal robes, and her crown was beside her on a table rather than on her head. The procession around the queen, as she arrived from the palace, was also smaller.\u2018We will work hard every day to gain the trust and confidence of the British people, making their priorities our priorities.\u2019The queen, whose address was written by Mrs. May\u2019s team, confirmed the government\u2019s plans to convert EU legislation into U.K. law to smooth the transition out of the bloc. The government also plans to implement legislation to establish new national policies on areas including immigration.The government also said the U.K. would put in place a legislative framework to allow it to operate its own independent trade policy, a signal the government intends not to be subject to the common external tariffs of the EU\u2019s customs union. The bill would bring EU nationals living in the U.K. into Britain\u2019s immigration system, the government said, so their rights would no longer be determined by EU law.As part of the effort to reassert control, the U.K. said it would set its own quotas for fishing and take on the management of its waters. As Britain negotiates its exit with its EU counterparts, the two sides will have to navigate a host of tricky and potentially thorny areas, from fishing to banking regulations to pensions.The negotiations, which kicked off earlier this week, come at a difficult time for Britain amid a series of tragedies.A fire at a West London public-housing building earlier this month, in which more than 79 people were killed, has prompted outrage toward the government and angry questions about why fire-safety regulations appear not to have been properly enforced. London and Manchester have also been struck\u00a0by four terror attacks in recent months, prompting the government to announce review of its counterextremism strategy.As part of the review, the government will assess the length of prison sentences for terror offenses and consider whether the police and security services have sufficient powers. It said it would work with tech companies to restrict the availability of extremist content online.The speech omitted several policies the party campaigned on, including a key pledge to cut annual migration to tens of thousands from the current level of about 250,000.Write to Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'Queen Lays Out May\u2019s Two-Year U.K. Agenda.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 14:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/queen-lays-out-u-k-s-brexit-counterterrorism-plans-in-low-key-speech-1498043876", "news_title": "Queen Lays Out U.K.\u2019s Brexit, Counterterrorism Plans in Low-Key Speech ", "keywords": " brexit, brexitinsert, brexitinset, brexit talks, british parliament, donald trump's visit, eu,queen's speech, queen elizabeth, u.k.,uk politics,European Union,Theresa May,Queen Elizabeth II,political,general news,crime,legal action,international relations,cybercrime,hacking,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,elections"}, {"content": "Auto makers are trying to take a giant leap forward by developing driverless cars. They appear to be stumbling as they take baby steps toward accomplishing the goal.J.D. Power\u2019s annual Initial Quality Study, a closely watched indicator of which companies make the best cars and technology, found that buyers are increasingly dissatisfied with the semiautonomous features showing up on vehicles. Advanced safety gear, including adaptive cruise control, autonomous braking and lane-departure assist, represented the largest increase in problems in this year\u2019s study.The results, issued Wednesday, follow years of complaints by researchers and consumers concerning vehicle technologies. Touch screens, voice controls, navigation systems and other gadgets often have glitches when first introduced. These issues have hurt the reputation of auto makers trying to outrun Silicon Valley in the race to reinvent vehicle cabins, entertainment systems and, ultimately, the way a car is operated.California-based J.D. Power estimates most vehicle components, including electronics and infotainment, are improving. The IQS study, polling thousands of buyers within the first three months of ownership, found participants are ranking quality at the highest level ever.There was an average of nearly 13 complaints about semiautonomous features per 100 vehicles in 2017, up from about 12 problems in 2016. While only a slight uptick, semiautonomous features were the only category that didn\u2019t improve this year. Of all problems reported by consumers in 2017, 34% were related to adaptive cruise control, up from 17% in 2016.Semiautonomous features \u201care coming quickly and some customers are registering some concerns,\u201d said Dave Sargent, a vice president at J.D. Power. \u201cThis is not a major problem yet but could become one if industry moves too fast.\u201dThe problems with semiautonomous features should sound a warning bell for auto makers, tech companies and parts suppliers.\u00a0Customers will need to be convinced that these semiautonomous features that are the building blocks for autonomous vehicles are foolproof before they give up driving control.\u201cThe question for auto makers is, \u2018How do they communicate and explain these features to the general public?\u2019\u201d Jim Sayer, director of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, said at a separate event Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s something all manufacturers will struggle with because there\u2019s not always consistency in how these systems operate, or even what they\u2019re called.\u201dAuto makers and regulators are taking steps to make semiautonomous safety gear becomes more ubiquitous. Nearly a dozen top car companies, for instance, have pledged to make automatic emergency brakes standard on future vehicles.The federal government has embraced the idea that driverless cars will eventually reduce traffic fatalities, and late last year rolled out guidelines for car makers and other developer to submit to a 15-point \u201csafety assessment.\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time vehicle technologies have frustrated customers.Problems with infotainment systems including the wireless Bluetooth connections for smartphones and voice-recognition features were the most frequent frustrations voiced by owners of 2014 model-year vehicles in another study by J.D.

His successor, though, will have to contend with scandals on numerous fronts, a leadership team gutted by executive departures and ousters, and\u00a0a workplace culture widely criticized for being permissive of sexual harassment and sexism.\u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-generation opportunity,\u2019\u2019 said       Jeffrey Cohn,        managing director of global CEO succession planning for DHR International, an executive-search firm.Yet any future Uber CEO will have to contend with Mr. Kalanick, who is expected to remain an influential presence at the ride-hailing company: He will keep a seat on Uber\u2019s board of directors and he retains control of a majority of its voting shares. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be [his] puppet,\u201d Mr. Cohn said.In launching a search for a new leader, Uber likely will suspend its pending hunt for a chief operating officer, according to people familiar with the matter.Heidrick & Struggles International Inc.,       a search firm in charge of Uber\u2019s hunt for a COO, probably will now focus instead on the CEO assignment, one of the people said.A board member could step in to fill Mr. Kalanick\u2019s shoes temporarily\u2014particularly       Arianna Huffington,        who has emerged as the main voice for Uber\u2019s board in recent months and has taken a prominent role in Uber\u2019s investigation into its workplace practices\u2014said       Bart Friedman,        a corporate governance expert and senior counsel at law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP.Given her limited operational experience, though, some executive recruiters say she is unlikely to be a candidate for the chief executive role longer term, and is a long shot even as an interim leader. Mr. Friedman said Uber co-founder Garrett Camp, also its chairman, is a dark horse as he \u201cmay not demonstrate sufficient change for investors, who will really be calling the shots.\u201d\u201cThe investors are going to be looking for not only someone who is transformative but a big public-relations success,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is going to have to be a headsnapper.\u201dMs. Huffington couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.Mr. Cohn said he expects Uber to choose an external candidate to replace Mr. Kalanick \u201cif they are serious about getting the culture in shape.\u2019\u2019 The outside recruit also should know how to take them through an initial public offering, he said.A number of talented executives who didn\u2019t want Uber\u2019s No. 2 spot would be interested in being CEO, Mr. Cohn said. He cited       Tom Staggs,        the former No. 2 at             Walt Disney Co.      , as one such possibility. Uber had interviewed Mr. Staggs to be second in command, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Mr. Staggs couldn\u2019t immediately be reached.An ideal pick would be a star player from a technology-services industry with operational, global and turnaround\u00a0experience, said Dora Vell, CEO of tech recruiting firm Vell & Associates.She added that she doesn\u2019t see qualified candidates on Uber\u2019s board or management team.Ms. Vell, who has placed leaders of several small- and medium-sized tech companies, suggested several potential prospects for the No. 1 job. Among them is       Keith Block,        president of             Salesforce.com Inc.       and a 26-year veteran of             Oracle Corp.\u201cHe\u2019s very, very strong operationally,\u201d Ms. Vell said. \u201cI know he\u2019s CEO material.

A Salesforce.com spokeswoman declined to comment.Other possible picks for Uber CEO include       Safra Catz,        co-CEO of Oracle, and Pat Gelsinger, CEO of VMware, a unit of Dell Inc., according to Ms. Vell. An Oracle spokeswoman declined comment about whether Ms. Catz might join Uber.

The company has also asked, or will ask, judges in St. Louis to throw out a handful of verdicts under appeal and to place on hold other cases that the company says should be thrown out.On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that California courts could hear only claims that Californians filed against             Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.       alleging its Plavix blood-thinner raised the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Johnson & Johnson divested Nucynta ER in 2015.The lawsuits come as politicians, law-enforcement officials and public-health leaders nationwide increasingly cite the addiction epidemic as a major priority. Widespread opioid addiction has pushed U.S. overdose death rates to all-time highs. Many people became addicted by taking powerful opioid painkillers and often progressed to heroin if they couldn\u2019t get access to pills.Public-health officials have long blamed aggressive company marketing and lax prescribing for sparking the crisis.Mr. Hawley said the opioid-addiction crisis has been a key focus since he took office in January. Missouri\u2019s death rate from opioids is 1.6 times greater than the national average, and the state recorded 30,000 hospitalizations and emergency-room visits tied to opioids in 2015\u2014a 200% increase from a decade earlier, Mr. Hawley said in an interview.In April, several prominent political figures in Missouri wrote an open letter urging Mr. Hawley to run for U.S. Senate in 2018.

They said chemicals and materials found at his apartment suggested he made the bomb.The prosecutors said they had indications the suspect had sympathy for Islamic State, but provided no further details.An official briefed on the investigation identified the suspect as Oussama Zariouh. Other officials, who identified him officially only as O.Z., said he had lived in the Brussels neighborhood of Molenbeek since 2013 and had been investigated for drug-related crimes.However, officials said that while the man wasn\u2019t considered high-risk by Belgian authorities, he had communicated with other self-radicalized individuals. Those contacts weren\u2019t with people considered dangerous terror suspects, said one official, although U.S. and Belgian intelligence agencies are investigating whether he communicated with other, higher-ranking terror suspects.Eric Van Der Sypt, a spokesman for the prosecutors, declined to comment on any ties to a broader network.The Brussels attack, by a suspect without previously known ties to extremist groups acting alone and targeting a public space near a tourist area, had echoes of other recent terror attacks in Europe.Islamic State, U.S. and European officials said, has been emphasizing for the past year and a half that radical jihadists in Europe shouldn\u2019t come to the Middle East to fight, but should instead remain at home and carry out attacks.Offering new details of the Tuesday night attack, officials said the man entered Brussels Central Station at 8:39 p.m. and approached a group of passengers before grabbing his suitcase, shouting and causing a small explosion.No one was hurt in the initial blast, but the suitcase caught fire. The man then fled, leaving the suitcase, and ran downstairs, prosecutors saidThe abandoned bag exploded in what prosecutors described as a second, more violent blast. The man returned to the hall where the explosion occurred, rushing a soldier and shouted \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d Arabic for God is great. The soldier fired several times, killing the suspect, prosecutors said. His body then lay there for hours as the Belgian military bomb squad examined the scene for undetonated explosives.\u201cIt\u2019s clear he wanted to do more damage than he did. He tried to set off the luggage, which exploded a second time, so it could have been much worse,\u201d said Mr. Van Der Sypt.The man lived in Molenbeek, the Brussels neighborhood that authorities have said is where a number of terrorists connected to the Paris and Belgium attacks were based. Police raided the man\u2019s home last night, officials said, and other searches were conducted in Molenbeek on Wednesday.Police conducting the raid on Zariouh\u2019s apartment in a small redbrick townhouse carted away a laptop, a phone, a tablet computer and hard drive, witnesses and officials said. Officials briefed on the investigation said such electronic devices could provide more clues about his contacts before the attack.U.S. officials said they have offered assistance, as is standard practice, in analyzing any electronic devices recovered in the investigation.Several of the apartments in the building were raided, a bomb squad was on site and police took in at least one resident in for questioning, who was released later.Mustafa Er, spokesman for Molenbeek town hall said the suspect was self-employed and had come to Belgium in 2002 and lived in other towns before moving to Molenbeek. Neighbors said they didn\u2019t see much of Zariouh.\u201cHe\u2026had a petty criminal past in connection to drugs,\u201d said Annalisa Gadaleta, a local councilor in Molenbeek, who added that the community was now awaiting the result of the investigation and whether Zariouh had connections to other groups.Ms. Gadaleta highlighted the difficulty of tracking people who self radicalize and aren\u2019t known to authorities.More than 100 radicalized suspects listed by national authorities live in Molenbeek, although Zariouh wasn\u2019t on that list, said Ms. Gadaleta. Such lists are shared with local authorities.Ms. Gadaleta said the neighborhood had received reinforcements, with 50 extra policemen since 2015, but that this was insufficient for the scale of the problem. She said 100 more police officer posts are still to be filled.In the wake of the attack, Interior Minister       Jan Jambon       praised security forces and said Belgium\u2019s decision to keep its soldiers on street patrols and guarding sites such as the Brussels Central Station had been the right one.\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate you need certain things, like what happened last night, to prove that certain decisions are the good ones,\u201d Mr. Jambon said.In a separate interview on             RTL                   radio he said \u201cthe services and the military reacted in a very alert way\u2014we have no victims, no wounded, so that shows the security system worked.\u201d\u2014Natalia Drozdiak contributed to this article.Write to Valentina Pop at valentina.pop@wsj.com and Julian E.

Alvarez is 49-1-1, his one loss coming to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2013.Fight fans have been begging for this one to happen, and instead of the usual delays and skirmishes that can undo boxing matches, it\u2019s actually happening, with its participants entering at peak power.\u201cBoth fighters in their prime,\u201d cooed Oscar De La Hoya, the former champion turned promoter, who works with Alvarez.\u201cThe right timing,\u201d said Tom Loeffler, the promoter who works closely with Team Golovkin.There\u2019s indeed a lot to rave about with regard to Alvarez and Golovkin\u2014their respective rises, both compelling, and their offensive styles, which bode for a competitive and action-packed fight. It\u2019s a career-making fight with true global reach; before New York, the men did a publicity whirlwind in London. Boxing has had its fair share of snoozy doozies it\u2019s tried to dress up as big fights, but Canelo vs. Golovkin needs no dressing: it\u2019s the real deal.And yet it\u2019s only a matter of time before I feel obligated to be a jerk and ask both men an annoying question about that other fight, the one at the end of August, with what\u2019s-his-name and you-know-who.Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor.Yeah, them.For a while, it seemed that Alvarez and Golovkin would have the Summer of Hype to themselves. They\u2019d agreed on Sept. 16\u2014a prime night\u2014and all the paperwork was done. This odd proposition of Mayweather stepping out of undefeated retirement to battle a UFC loudmouth with no boxing r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u2014who even knew if that thing would ever happen?Maybe it would. But probably not.And now, suddenly, Mayweather vs. McGregor is happening, Aug. 26, in the very same Vegas arena Alvarez and Golovkin will battle three weeks later. Regardless of whether or not you think it will be a thrilling showdown\u2014the casinos certainly don\u2019t, installing Mayweather as a 1-7 favorite (wager $7 to net $1), according to William Hill\u2014it\u2019s hard to deny that it will suck a lot of oxygen out of the fight game for the next couple months.There\u2019s also some worry of a negative ripple effect: that if Mayweather-McGregor is a uncompetitive bore, it might prevent frustrated pay-per-view buyers from purchasing Canelo-Golovkin, even if, on paper, it\u2019s a much more worthy event.It doesn\u2019t feel very fair. But that\u2019s boxing! It\u2019s a business, and it can be shameless.Alvarez and Golovkin\u2014low-key talkers compared with the endlessly hyperbolic Mayweather and McGregor\u2014don\u2019t do shameless. Though the matchup is an unprecedented opportunity for both men to craft and raise their profiles, they want to sell their fight on its merits. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any ugly animosity between the two, who go back years, and have even sparred with each other. They don\u2019t seem eager to manufacture phony tension, as boxers sometimes will.\u201cI know Saul a long time,\u201d Golovkin said, using Alvarez\u2019s given name (\u201cCanelo\u201d which loosely translated means \u201cLittle Cinnamon\u201d is the red-haired fighter\u2019s nickname). \u201cThe last six, seven years, he\u2019s destroyed everybody. Same with me. Nobody\u2019s stayed close with us.\u201d\u201cI respect what he\u2019s done,\u201d Alvarez said in Spanish, speaking through a translator. \u201cTo sell a big fight, you don\u2019t need animosity. I think the fans know who we are and what we\u2019ve accomplished and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201dDe La Hoya, ever the promoter, hastened to add: once the fight begins, all that mutual respect will go out the window.\u201cThis fight is going to elevate boxing\u2019s image to new heights,\u201d De La Hoya said. \u201cThis is the new age.\u201dAs for that other thing, whatever it is, Alvarez coolly batted it away.\u201cThe fans know which fight is the real fight, and what they\u2019ll want to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they want a real fight, they\u2019ll know what to do.\u201dWill they watch it?Golovkin took a glance at the hulking timepiece on his wrist, and smiled.\u201cIf I have time,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe.\u201dWrite to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'Alvarez and Golovkin Promise a \u2018Real\u2019 Fight.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 13:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canelo-alvarez-and-gennady-golovkin-promise-a-better-fight-than-whats-their-faces-1498065185", "news_title": "Canelo Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin Promise a Better Fight Than Whats-Their-Faces", "keywords": "boxing,canelo,canelo alvarez,conor mcgregor,floyd mayweather,gennedy golovkin,ggg,golovkin,mayweather mcgregor,combat sports,sports,recreation,commentaries,opinions,routine general news"}, {"content": "Last night viewers of cable news were the first to learn that Republican Karen Handel had defeated Democrat       Jon Ossoff       in the special election to fill a U.S. House seat in Georgia. Long before any news outlet formally declared Ms. Handel\u2019s victory, CNN and MSNBC regulars disclosed the outcome with their funereal tones and cheerless visages. It\u2019s becoming a competitive advantage for the two cable nets on election nights, allowing viewers to learn unofficial results with one glance at the screen.MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow seems to have been so distraught over the emerging defeat in Georgia that she abandoned the subject and resumed \u201cconnecting the dots\u201d among people President Trump or his acquaintances may have known. Your humble correspondent did not stay on the channel long enough to know if she made it all the way to Kevin Bacon, but found it useful to learn her unequivocal if unspoken statement about Georgia.Ms. Maddow\u2019s implicit forecast was accurate. Ms. Handel ended up winning by four percentage points, a bigger margin than Republican Ralph Norman enjoyed in winning Tuesday\u2019s South Carolina special election that nobody expected to be close. Now what?Liberals may need some time and space to get over the Georgia result. In the             New York Times,       Frank Bruni captures the anguish of Democrats\u2014and not just the ones who work in the media industry:Good question. Maybe it\u2019s not a majority-building, vote-winning, concrete thing. Democrats might start by asking whether they can persuade moderate voters to join their coalition by preaching \u201cresistance\u201d to a legitimate government and\u2014without a shred of evidence\u2014accusing a duly-elected president of treason.Then there are lots of tactical questions. Even before Election Day in Georgia, Slate noted that the Ossoff campaign would be relying on strong turnout from people who were not easy to find:So Mr. Ossoff\u2019s campaign seems to have enraged some voters, while others were not as enraged at Mr. Trump as you might think from consuming national news. Perhaps answering Mr. Bruni\u2019s question of whether anti-Trump passion is largely theatrical\u2014and also explaining the challenge facing Democrats\u2014      Josh Kraushaar      writes in the National Journal:This column has noted previously that voters seem to approve of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda\u2014particularly his focus on American economic revival\u2014much more than they approve of Mr. Trump. This suggests that many voters see his well-documented flaws as worthy of serious consideration, but not a grave threat to the republic.Of course most of the credit for Ms. Handel\u2019s win belongs to Ms. Handel. On Tuesday night campaign volunteers in Georgia and television viewers around the country saw a gracious and dignified winner. She offered a serious and timely message of reconciliation and civility in the wake of last week\u2019s attempted political assassinations.Republicans remain undefeated in special elections since Mr. Trump\u2019s November victory.

Likely from bats.Fighting emerging infectious diseases costs billions of dollars, as the AIDS pandemic and the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa attest. So researchers from New York City-based nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance set out several years ago to try to pinpoint where and how future pandemics might erupt. Analyzing a database of wildlife species and viruses known to infect mammals and people, they calculated how many unknown viruses may be out there, who carries them and where they are likely to be.Most new infectious diseases, such as HIV, Ebola and SARS, originate in animals and spill over into humans. If the viruses that cause them then start spreading from one person to another, they can cause outbreaks.Predicting the next pandemic is more critical now than ever, said       Peter Daszak,        disease ecologist and president of EcoHealth Alliance. The rate at which new viruses are infecting people is increasing, a consequence in part of global travel and economic development. \u201cWe travel the world in one day, and we take the viruses we pick up with us,\u201d Dr. Daszak said. \u201cThat\u2019s how viruses become pandemics.\u201dUsing a database of 2,805 mammal-virus connections, the researchers found that bats harbor nearly twice as many viruses that either threaten humans today or could threaten them in the future than the next mammal on the list\u2014primates.

Hodgkinson       was a troubled man who railed against Republicans on social media and kept more than 200 rounds of ammunition in a storage locker, but he didn\u2019t appear to have methodically planned his attack at a congressional baseball practice, an FBI official said Wednesday.\u201cI think he was struggling in a lot of aspects of his life,\u201d       Timothy Slater,        head of the criminal division at the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Washington field office, said at a press conference.Officials at the event provided new details of Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s final days before his June 14 rampage outside Washington, D.C., which critically injured Rep.       Steve Scalise       (R., La.) and wounded three others.Mr. Hodgkinson opened fire at a practice of Republicans preparing for a congressional charity game. Mr. Hodgkinson, armed with a rifle and handgun, was fatally shot by police.Mr. Slater confirmed that investigators had found a list with the names of six members of Congress on the shooter but declined to say who was on the list. The FBI doesn\u2019t consider this a \u201chit list,\u201d Mr. Slater said, because Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s internet search history didn\u2019t suggest he had formulated specific attack plans or targets.Rather, Mr. Slater said, a review of Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s web searches found \u201conly...a cursory search of two of the members.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the list was for...There\u2019s no indication that that was a list to target, or there was any threats associated with those names on the list.\u201dMr. Slater said Mr. Hodgkinson hadn\u2019t searched online for information about the baseball game they were practicing for in Virginia.Mr. Hodgkinson visited the office of Sen.       Bernie Sanders       (I., Vt.) in April, Mr. Slater said, and had visited other congressional buildings and taken photos, but he said those appeared to be the photos of a tourist.\u201cIt appears that...he was running out of money, he was not employed at the time of the event,\u201d Mr. Slater said. \u201cHe was married for 30 years and that appears that marriage was not going so well...It was just a pattern of life, where you could tell things were not going well.\u201dAt this point in the FBI\u2019s investigation, he added, the Bureau believes the attack was \u201cmore spontaneous\u201d than planned.Authorities said they were still investigating the shooting and haven\u2019t yet arrived at a complete understanding of Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s motivations, but acknowledged his anti-Republican posts on social media.Mr. Slater also said Mr. Hodgkinson had contacted a family member on June 12, two days before the shooting, seeking to return home to Illinois. Mr. Slater declined to say what that family member had told Mr. Slater in response, citing the continuing investigation.Separately, Mr. Scalise \u201ccontinues to make good progress,\u201d according to a statement Wednesday from MedStar Washington Hospital Center, which upgraded his condition to \u201cfair\u201d from \u201cserious.\u201d He is now \u201cbeginning an extended period of healing and rehabilitation,\u201d the hospital said.Mr. Scalise was near death when he was brought to the hospital after being shot in the hip by the gunman, and has undergone multiple surgeries.Write to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'FBI Details Shooter\u2019s Descent.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 13:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/virginia-ballfield-shooter-had-little-planning-before-rampage-fbi-says-1498064706", "news_title": "Virginia Ballfield Shooter Had Little Planning Before Rampage, FBI Says", "keywords": "ammunition, baseball shooter , bernie sanders ,congress,congressional baseball practice,congressional baseball shooter , fbi,gunman,james hodgkinson ,rampage,republican lawmakers,shooter, shooting,social media,steve scalise ,virginia ballfield ,FBI,James T.

WBA 1.13%       that had alleged the embattled laboratory startup breached the companies\u2019 contract, people familiar with the matter said. Walgreens\u2019 stores once hosted about 40 Theranos blood-testing centers, providing a main conduit to consumers.The pact would mean Walgreens\u2019 alliance with Theranos cost the drug retailer well over $100 million. In its suit, Walgreens had sought to recover the full $140 million it put into the partnership, including a $40 million convertible-debt note and a separate payment as part of an effort to expand the partnership.The tentative agreement calls for Theranos to pay Walgreens less than $30 million, according to some of the people familiar with the matter. The pact hadn\u2019t been completed as of late Tuesday and terms could change, the people said.Representatives for Walgreens and Theranos declined to comment.In its November 2016 suit, Walgreens alleged Theranos misled it about the state of the lab firm\u2019s technology as they formed their partnership, and about the firm\u2019s growing legal and regulatory challenges throughout 2016. Theranos has called the allegations \u201cunfounded.\u201dSeparately, Theranos told investors in a series of recent meetings that it had about $54 million in cash left as it sought to resolve claims, people familiar with the matter say. The Walgreens pact would further bite into that remaining supply of money. Theranos also carries insurance policies that could cover certain claims, court records show.Theranos has been burning through its cash. In January, it had about $187 million, according to an investor document made public last month in a court filing. The firm has been spending about $10 million a month since, much of it on legal costs, as it cut staff to about 170 from around 900 late last year, according to people familiar with the matter and the court filing.The company also spent about $5 million to settle allegations by the Arizona attorney general that it had misled consumers, and $10 million in connection with an agreement with another investor, legal records show. It settled a lawsuit by former investor Partner Fund Management for an undisclosed amount in May, the company said. People familiar with that confidential agreement said the amount was between $40 million and $50 million.Theranos has said the lawsuits against it were without merit and it has denied the Arizona attorney general\u2019s allegations.Theranos still faces a civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a criminal investigation by the Justice Department, according to court filings.In a series of meetings with investors in recent days, Theranos said it planned to ask some existing shareholders to loan it an additional $50 million, people familiar with the discussions said. As of Monday, that planned deal hadn\u2019t been completed, one of the people said.It isn\u2019t clear which investors may have been approached about the offer or whether any had agreed to do so. Theranos also plans to seek to raise $150 million to $200 million in a funding round next year, some of the people said.Theranos has retracted nearly one million medical-test results since regulators found problems early last year with its lab practices that they said put patients in danger, a court filing shows. After lab regulators barred Theranos from running medical labs for two years last summer, the company said it developed new blood-testing devices to sell to third-party lab operators. It hasn\u2019t yet sought regulatory approval for these devices.Walgreens had once viewed the partnership as a key pillar of its strategy to use its brick-and-mortar footprint to diversify into more areas of health-care services. Theranos had claimed it could do dozens of tests on a few drops of blood and Walgreens hoped to one day put its devices in its stores.Walgreens kicked off its relationship with Theranos in 2010, including with an internal party at the drugstore corporation\u2019s Deerfield, Ill., headquarters, company documents show.At the gathering, one Walgreens executive recited, to the tune of the John Lennon song \u201cImagine,\u201d lyrics urging listeners to imagine a world where blood tests could be done without pain, a person who was there recalled.The relationship became strained as both parties blamed the other for delays, and Walgreens managers became frustrated that Theranos repeatedly limited their access to its labs, data or devices, people familiar with the matter have said. The two companies finally rolled out their Phoenix-area pilot in late 2013.After The Wall Street Journal first raised questions about Theranos\u2019s technology and capabilities in October 2015, Walgreens said it would halt the nationwide expansion of the partnership.But it kept the Theranos testing centers at its Phoenix stores open for months and patients continued to receive blood tests there. Some Theranos patients later alleged that both Theranos and Walgreens misled them about their tests\u2019 accuracy. The cases are pending in an Arizona federal court, where a judge last week threw out some of the claims and asked the plaintiffs to amend others. The companies are fighting the suits and have said they are without merit.In June 2016, Walgreens abruptly ended its partnership with Theranos after executives grew frustrated they were learning of regulators\u2019 concerns from news reports, according to people familiar with the matter.Write to Christopher Weaver at christopher.weaver@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 13:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-walgreens-reach-deal-to-settle-lawsuit-1498037580", "news_title": "Theranos, Walgreens Reach Deal to Settle Lawsuit", "keywords": "theranos lawsuit,theranos settlement,vc industry news,walgreens theranos lawsuit,Theranos,Walgreen,WBA,WAG,Walgreens Boots Alliance,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,medical equipment,supplies,retail,wholesale,pharmacies,drug stores,specialty stores,health care,life sciences,sports teams,clubs,performing arts,sports promotion,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "Adobe        ADBE 0.70%       has proven that the cloud can have a silver lining.Many cloud software companies aren\u2019t yet reporting earnings -- even on favorable adjusted terms that exclude things like stock-based compensation. Adobe, meanwhile, has grown per-share earnings on a year-over-year basis every quarter for the last three years -- and that\u2019s based on generally accepted accounting principles. The company\u2019s fiscal second quarter results from late Tuesday continued that trend, with diluted per-share earnings up 56% year over year to 75 cents, beating analysts forecasts.For a company that now qualifies as an elder statesman in the turbulent software business, that sort of performance stands out.

Their algorithms change and there\u2019s no explanation,\u201d Mr. Sorrell said.He said the duo should take more responsibility for the content that\u2019s hosted on their platforms and behave like media companies.\u201cIn my view Google and Facebook are media companies, they are not technology companies. They are responsible for the content they distribute and they can\u2019t walk away from that,\u201d he said.Representatives for Google and Facebook had no immediate comment.Some advertisers pulled their spending from Google and YouTube earlier this year after revelations their ads ran alongside objectionable content. Google has made efforts to win them back, including improving the technology that screens videos and giving marketers more control.

Economists had expected a modest decline from April. Compared with a year earlier, sales were up 2.7% last month.\u201cThe fact that sales of existing homes rose in May -- despite incredibly limited selection, shrinking times on market and rapidly rising prices -- is a testament to just how strong the draw to homeownership is right now for millions of Americans,\u201d said Svenja Gudell, Zillow\u2019s chief economist.Sales have seesawed from month to month so far in 2017 and hit a 10-year high in March. At the same time, increasingly scarce inventory is driving up prices faster than household incomes are growing.\u201cThe way to solve this housing shortage, housing crisis that is developing, is to just build more homes,\u201d said       Lawrence Yun,        chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.The median sales price in May was $252,800, the highest nominal level on record and up 5.8% from a year earlier. There was a 4.2-month supply of homes on the market at the end of the month, based on the current sales pace. Inventory has declined on a year-over-year basis for 24 straight months.The median property remained on the market just 27 days in May, the shortest time since the trade group began tracking the metric six years ago.\u201cRight now we\u2019re in a true seller\u2019s market,\u201d said Mark Trenka, owner of Century 21 Trenka Real Estate in Denver. He said a home in the city was brought onto the market Saturday, had 30 showings and attracted 10 offers in one day\u2014and was under contract Sunday.Colorado\u2019s unemployment rate was a record-low 2.3% in May, according to the Labor Department. That, together with low inventory, is helping drive a \u201creally competitive\u201d environment, Mr. Trenka said.Purchases of previously owned homes account for roughly 90% of U.S. homebuying activity. Sales of newly built single-family homes dropped in April after three straight monthly rises, though economists expect the Commerce Department on Friday will report new-home sales rose 3.7% in May.Several factors are working to support buyers. The national unemployment rate in May was 4.3%, its lowest level since 2001. The economy continued to expand and add jobs in the first half of 2017, and gauges of household confidence remain elevated.Mortgage rates rose after last year\u2019s presidential election but edged down in recent months. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 4.01% in May, down from 4.05% in April, according to Freddie Mac.Still, the pace of new construction has lagged behind. Housing starts were up 3.2% in the first five months of 2017 compared with a year earlier, slowing from 5.6% growth in all of 2016.\u201cWe know builders have not caught up with the market,\u201d Mr. Trenka said. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting enough product.\u201dThat could change if builders ramp up production in response to fresh evidence of strong demand. Miami-based home builder             Lennar Corp.       on Tuesday reported its new orders were up about 12% on the year in the three months ended May 31, and the dollar value of new orders rose roughly 17% from a year earlier.\u201cThe slow and steady, though sometimes erratic, market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery continues to seem to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal,\u201d Chief Executive       Stuart Miller       told analysts.News Corp,       owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.Write to Ben Leubsdorf at ben.leubsdorf@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 12:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-up-in-may-despite-tight-supply-1498053950", "news_title": "U.S. Existing-Home Sales Rise in May Despite Tight Supply", "keywords": "housing demand, median home price, nar, national association of realtors, u.s. economic growth,u.s. existing-home prices,u.s. existing home sales, u.s. home resales, unsold home inventory,National Association of Realtors,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,home sales,housing affordability,economic news,housing sales,housing prices,real estate markets,building construction,residential building construction,construction,real estate"}, {"content": "New York City officials said Wednesday they would create a fellowship with a police oversight agency as part of a settlement with retired tennis star James Blake over his 2015 mistaken arrest.Mr. Blake, 37 years old, was tackled by a New York Police Department officer as he waited for a car near Grand Central Terminal in 2015. Police said the officer misidentified Mr. Blake as a suspect in an investigation.The fellow, who will work with a city independent police oversight agency called the Civilian Complaint Review Board, will \u201cfoster relationships with community leaders and increase awareness\u201d of the agency, city officials said. The agreement funds the position for six years, at a salary of more than $65,000 per year.\u00a0The first fellow, who must be a lawyer, will begin in January, officials said.The city doesn\u2019t admit fault as part of the settlement, a Law Department spokesman said.\u00a0The agreement also includes less than $175,000 to cover legal fees and expenses, he said.Kevin Marino, an attorney for Mr. Blake, said his client had always sought to use the incident for what he called the greater good.\u201cWe immediately understood he could turn this very unfortunate incident into a tremendous benefit that transcends his own experience, and really do something significant to address this problem,\u201d he said.Mr. Blake was standing next to Grand Hyatt hotel near Grand Central Terminal in September of 2015, when officer James Frascatore tackled him, surveillance video showed.Police had said Officer Frascatore, in plainclothes, misidentified Mr. Blake as a suspect in a credit-card fraud investigation. Two witnesses pointed out Mr. Blake as the suspect, police said. Then-Police Commissioner       William Bratton       placed the officer on modified duty after the incident.\u201cI\u2019m gratified that the city has seen fit to settle this matter in a relatively minor way,\u201d said Stephen Worth, an attorney for Officer Frascatore. \u201cIt will go a long way to correcting the false narrative that exists concerning Officer Frascatore.\u201dMr. Blake filed a notice of claim with the city but never filed a lawsuit.The city\u2019s Civilian Complaint Review Board investigated and accused the officer of using excessive force one month later. The CCRB would serve as the prosecution in Officer Frascatore\u2019s department trial.Last month, the CCRB and Officer Frascatore\u2019s attorney were planning on presenting a deal to the trial\u2019s judge that would allow the officer to avoid the proceedings and as a result, the possibility of being fired. He would likely be subject to a loss of vacation time.A person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday that deal was close to being reached now that the city and Mr. Blake had reached a settlement.In a statement, Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said the fellowship will enhance the board\u2019s process by ensuring complaints are investigated quickly and thoroughly.\u00a0City officials said Wednesday that last year the agency closed just over half of the complaints it received without a full investigation.\u00a0Typically, complainants, victims or witnesses don\u2019t cooperate with the agency in these cases, officials said, so the agency can\u2019t determine misconduct.Mr. Blake, who is biracial, spoke publicly about the need for better relations between police and communities in the weeks after the incident.

Yet in the U.S. he may be the least familiar of postwar German painters, less recognized than such colleagues as       Georg Baselitz,       Anselm Kiefer,       Sigmar Polke       and       Gerhard Richter.       That may be about to change.Markus L\u00fcpertz: Threads of HistoryHirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden  Through Sept. 10Markus L\u00fcpertzThe Phillips Collection  Through Sept. 3A pair of concurrent exhibitions in Washington\u2014\u201cMarkus L\u00fcpertz: Threads of History\u201d at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and \u201cMarkus L\u00fcpertz\u201d at the Phillips Collection\u2014together offer an overview of five decades of the artist\u2019s paintings, the first American museum survey of his work. (There are also recent paintings at       Michael Werner       Gallery, New York.) The exhibitions and their ambitious joint catalog present a sometimes perplexing, always fascinating artist who makes us ponder the boundaries between abstraction and reference, and think hard about the very nature of painting itself.Despite belonging to a generation who came of age in the shadow of World War II, during the Cold War, when Germany began to deal publicly with its brutal recent history, Mr. L\u00fcpertz is said to have wanted to be \u201can artist without responsibilities\u201d\u2014one who concentrated on the abstract essentials of picture-making and avoided political or sociological content, in contrast to his contemporaries who advocated expressionist figuration and \u201cGerman\u201d themes. We can take Mr. L\u00fcpertz at his word and savor his paintings for their virtuoso paint handling, saturated hues, generous scale, and firm, confrontational compositions. Yet it\u2019s obvious that no matter how richly inflected his touch may be, no matter how audacious his pictorial structures, Mr. L\u00fcpertz also always responded to the crucial events of his working life: the construction of the Berlin Wall, the trial and execution of       Adolf Eichmann,        Germany\u2019s collective admission of culpability for the Holocaust, growing postwar prosperity, the actions of the Baader-Meinhof terrorist gang in the 1970s, the destruction of the Berlin Wall, the reunification of East and West Germany, and the rebuilding of shattered Berlin, among many other things.Far from being dispassionate abstractions, Mr. L\u00fcpertz\u2019s paintings are haunted by more or less explicit allusions. But it\u2019s a shifting terrain that keeps us guessing, despite the sometimes specific hints offered by his titles, which can refer to everything from Donald Duck to tents for camping to Poussin and Parsifal. In works from the 1970s, for example, we easily recognize the Stahlhelm, the characteristic German army helmet, and military caps. Even earlier, in 1968, there\u2019s an enormous mural-size, meticulously shaded riff on the repetitive tank-trap fortifications of the Siegfried Line. That, in turn, proves to have been anticipated by a domestic version of the composition: rows of crisp, carefully aligned wooden roof shingles. But as in most of Mr. L\u00fcpertz\u2019s canvases, reference is usually subsumed, even overwhelmed, by the paintings\u2019 abstract qualities.Throughout both exhibitions, we\u2019re constantly knocked off-balance as apparently abstract forms morph into heads and back again, and as multicolored geometric configurations suggest everything from still lifes to tents to architecture. Sometimes, we think we\u2019ve identified a reference or come to terms with particularly complex spatial inventions, as in the Babylon series, in which compressed columnar forms with unstable perspectival illusions suggest tall buildings. But we soon find ourselves seduced by paint applications, from bold swipes to thin washes; by rich color, coiling lines, rhythmically stabbed patterns, drips and much, much more, all in the service of unpredictable shapes. And to complicate things, Mr. L\u00fcpertz frequently works in series, repeating a single image with eye-testing variations, the equivalents, he tells us, of the individual frames of a film that, similarly, evoke the passage of time.Many of Mr. L\u00fcpertz\u2019s titles include the word \u201cdithyramb.\u201d Originally referring to the ecstatic verses created by ancient Greek followers of Dionysus, the term, for him, stands for what the wall texts call \u201cthe primacy of the artist\u2019s expressive power over the subject\u201d\u2014that is, the nominal subject that triggered the improvisatory process of picture-making loses its original meaning by being translated into this new state of being, since any painting is both abstract and a fiction. The painted frames on many of the included works emphasize the artifice of the process.Mr. L\u00fcpertz\u2019s most recent works are his most explicit. We recognize an ample nude inspired by Rubens, references to classical sculpture, and landscape forms, tantalizingly repeated. Alerted by these signals, we begin to read his entire project as a conversation with the history of art and begin to consider all the exhibited works in new ways. \u201cWithout painting,\u201d Mr. L\u00fcpertz wrote, \u201cthe world is only consumed, it is not perceived.\u201d His best works make us question our assumptions and intensify our perceptions.Note: The Hirshhorn exhibition focuses on the 1960s and 1970s and should be seen first.

Forget lobster rolls, I tell skeptics; you\u2019re going to love the kao klug kapi. And the always come away from Long Grain, in Camden, with a one-word reaction: \u201cWow.\u201dTiny, noisy and always crowded, Long Grain has become an institution in the heart of my resolutely Yankee seaside community in the seven years since it opened. Camden is the epitome of picturesque coastal Maine, where lobster rolls and fried clams are the usual plats du jour. Yet the restaurant\u2019s 22 seats are packed, lunch and dinner, year-round; the seven-seat bar is filled with regulars, and carry-out customers crowd the entrance, lining up outside on Elm Street in good weather.They\u2019re drawn by the seductive menu compiled by chef Ravin Nakjaroen and his wife,       Paula Palakawong,        who is also dining-room manager and occasional sous-chef. The menu not only tastes of Thailand but also of home cooking, street food and market stalls across Southeast Asia\u2014richly fragrant soups, noodle dishes that combine sleek and crunchy textures, sharp and oily flavors, all pulled together with the freshness of rigorously sourced local, seasonal Maine ingredients.If you\u2019re thinking, yeah, sure, there\u2019s not a chef in the country these days who doesn\u2019t say he or she sources locally, I suggest you step up to Long Grain\u2019s bar, where from one day to the next, you\u2019ll meet the fisherman who brings in locally caught mackerel, squid and mussels; the farmer who provides the greens; the egg lady from nearby Lincolnville; the tofu producer from just next door. Challenging though it may be in the middle of a Maine winter, sourcing locally makes a quid pro quo that works for farmers, fishermen and other food producers as much as it does for chefs. The more the restaurant requires, the more local purveyors can provide. And other restaurants benefit too.The kao klug kapi I so highly recommend, which appears from time to time as a special, fascinates me. This extravagantly garnished, flavor-bomb shrimp fried rice stands out from the usual menu items in the way the ingredients arrive separately on the plate\u2014\u201cLike Korean bibimbap,\u201d Mr. Nakjaroen said when I asked him about the dish\u2014yet combine on the palate in a surprising and delicious succession of flavors. In the Thai tradition, the vegetables are raw, lending crisp texture and sharp flavor to the dish, which also includes rich caramelized pork belly and the stimulating marine flavors of dried shrimp and shrimp paste.\u2018The ingredients arrive separately on the plate yet combine on the palate in a surprising succession of flavors.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s a home-style dish, but it was almost forgotten,\u201d said Ms. Palakawong. \u201cI doubt you could find it in a Bangkok restaurant nowadays. But these old traditions are starting to make a come back. It\u2019s kind of nostalgic.\u201dKao klug kapi literally translates as \u201cshrimp-paste-tossed rice,\u201d but in Mr. Nakjaroen\u2019s hands it becomes much more. Traditionally, the pork belly is shredded, but at Long Grain, toothsome chunks of well-marbled belly from local pigs adorn the dish. And the green mango used in Thailand becomes julienned strips of Maine-grown Granny Smith apples. \u201cIt\u2019s a dish from my grandmother\u2019s kitchen,\u201d said Mr. Nakjaroen. \u201cThat\u2019s where I learned to cook. Back then, there was no refrigeration in Bangkok, so people like my grandmother went to market every morning. And I went right along with her when I was a kid. That market is one of a kind.\u201d He smiled at the memory. \u201cBangkok is known for its street food. I mean, it\u2019s insane.\u201dMr. Nakjaroen and Ms. Palakawong grew up in Bangkok but met in their late teens in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., after their families emigrated from Thailand. After they married, they opened a 200-seat restaurant called       Four Rivers       in Fort Lauderdale that was remarkably popular, to their mutual surprise, despite the menu\u2019s lack of pad thai. \u201cIt was farm-to-table before that was a thing,\u201d Ms. Palakawong said. \u201cWhen it wasn\u2019t local, it was very high quality\u2014wild fish, not farmed, for instance. That was 10 years ago.\u201dThe couple were invited to Maine by a colleague who opened a place on Camden\u2019s waterfront that eventually failed. Still, Maine\u2019s affordability held a strong appeal for a young couple without a lot of money with which to open a restaurant. Shortly afterward, the Elm Street hole-in-the-wall space became available. Mr. Nakjaroen, widely known as Bas, was already noted for the quality of his cooking. I had been following him from that first waterfront restaurant position and through various other brief stops, sometimes losing sight of him, always delighted when I found him again. He was a local myth by the time Long Grain opened, in the fall of 2010. And the community responded enthusiastically.Today, the couple and their 8-year-old daughter, Ravita, are fixtures here in Camden, not totally Mainers yet\u2014one does have to be here four generations to qualify\u2014but well on their way, and all the more welcome for the great food they\u2019ve introduced to this coastal town. There may not be lobster rolls on the menu at Long Grain, but nobody is complaining.Make the pork belly the day before and let it marinate overnight. The garnishes and the rice can be prepared the morning of the day you\u2019re planning to serve the dish. Finally, assemble the fried rice on a big serving platter or on individual deep plates, with plenty of room to arrange the garnishes and the pork over and around the mound of rice. Each diner helps him or herself to garnishes and rice, mixing them together on the plate. Shrimp paste, dried shrimp and other Thai ingredients can be found in Asian markets or online at templeofthai.com.Active Time: 1 hour Total Time: 8 hours (includes marinating) Serves: 4For the spicy caramelized pork belly:For the garnishes:For the finished dish:1. Make spicy caramelized pork belly: Combine peppercorns and salt in a mortar. Crush with pestle, then crush in, one at a time, garlic, shallots and cilantro roots to form a paste. (Alternatively, use a food processor.)2. Heat oil in a heavy duty pan over medium heat. Scrape every bit of peppercorn paste into oil and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Stir in palm sugar along with a tablespoon of water and increase heat to high. Cook, stirring constantly, to caramelize the palm sugar, about 3 minutes.3. Add pork belly and cook, stirring constantly, 5 minutes. Stir in, one at a time, oyster sauce, fish sauce and dark soy sauce. Continue stirring to break up and melt palm sugar and combine it thoroughly with other seasonings.4. Reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce is thick and pork is caramelized, 30 minutes. Fat part of pork should still be firm in texture. Remove pork and set aside to marinate in sauce at least a few hours or, ideally, overnight. After marinating, drain excess fat and discard, but leave pork in sauce.5. Make garnishes: Beat eggs with a fork, just enough to combine whites and yolks. Heat oil in a wok over medium heat, tilting wok to coat it entirely with oil. Pour in eggs and tilt wok to coat with a thin layer of egg, as if making a cr\u00eape. When eggs are thoroughly cooked, start at one end and gently roll omelet up, then set aside to cool. Once cool, slice crosswise into very thin strips. Set aside.6. Partially peel apple, leaving stripes of skin, then cut into quarters, core and slice into very thin julienne strips, to make about 1 cup julienned apple. Squeeze juice from half lime over julienned apple to prevent browning. Partially peel cucumber, leaving stripes of skin, cut away seeds and julienne.7. When ready to serve: Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place pork with sauce in a baking dish, cover with aluminum foil and warm in oven while you continue to prepare dish. Fold and seal shrimp paste in 1 small sheet of aluminum foil to make a flat envelope, then roast over an open gas or other flame, turning several times, until fragrant, 6 minutes. (Alternatively, put shrimp paste in a cast-iron skillet and cook over high heat, turning paste several times, until fragrant, 6 minutes.) Remove and let cool, then mix shrimp paste with a tablespoon of water until completely dissolved.8. Set a wok over medium heat and add chopped dried shrimp. Cook, tossing, until shrimp are crisp, 3 minutes. Remove shrimp from wok and set aside.9. Add oil to wok and return to medium heat. Add cooked rice and stir-fry, tossing, as you slowly add diluted shrimp paste. Mix thoroughly, tossing and stirring, until rice is very hot, then add fried shrimp and toss again.10.

The company is trying to stay afloat after the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric Co., left it with an estimated loss of nearly $9 billion for the year ended March 31.The state-backed investment fund, Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, said it is pursuing the deal because \u201cthere is significant social value for this technology and business to remain in Japan.\u201d The Toshiba memory chips are used in             Apple Inc.\u2019s        AAPL 0.63%       iPhones as well as computers that are the backbone of internet services.Fast-growing demand and security concerns are turning the semiconductor business into a battlefield among governments of the leading economic powers. China has said it will funnel tens of billions of dollars to buy semiconductor technology overseas and develop it domestically. That has unsettled other producers, and the governments of the U.S. and Taiwan have blocked some Chinese bids.Also in the consortium are the 100% government-owned Development Bank of Japan and U.S. private-equity firm Bain Capital.             SK Hynix Inc.,       a South Korean chip maker, said it would join as a lender.Japan\u2019s industry minister,       Hiroshige Seko,        hailed the announcement, saying the government-backed bid met the conditions he had set for preventing technology leakage and keeping jobs at home.Toshiba said it wants to conclude an agreement with the group by next Wednesday, the day of the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.\u2018Toshiba is throwing away its own future with today\u2019s decision because it should have settled with Western Digital first before selecting a preferred bidder.\u2019Details of the bid weren\u2019t disclosed. One person briefed on the offer said it totaled slightly more than \u00a52 trillion ($18 billion), and the Japanese government-backed investors would own more than half of the unit.Closing the deal won\u2019t be easy. Toshiba\u2019s chip business partner,             Western Digital Corp.      , which says it has the right to veto any transaction, has filed a request for binding arbitration and separately asked a state court in California to block any deal. In a statement Wednesday after Toshiba\u2019s announcement, Western Digital reiterated its claims and said it looks forward to a court hearing July 14.\u201cToshiba is throwing away its own future with today\u2019s decision because it should have settled with Western Digital first before selecting a preferred bidder,\u201d said       Satoru Oyama,        an analyst at research firm             IHS Markit.       He predicted that the court fight would stymie Toshiba\u2019s goal of getting cash from the sale quickly.Toshiba rejects Western Digital\u2019s claims, saying it is permitted to make a deal on its own.Other countries\u2019 antitrust authorities, notably China\u2019s, could also step in to delay the deal, on the theory that the involvement of rival chip maker SK Hynix could lessen competition.Although Toshiba hasn\u2019t released audited financial results since last year, it estimates that as of March 31 it had negative shareholder equity of \u00a5540 billion ($4.9 billion). If it is still negative next March, Toshiba shares would be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.The Japanese government-led group wasn\u2019t the highest bidder, according to people briefed on the bids. Taiwan-based iPhone assembler Foxconn Technology Group, formally known as             Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.      , was ready to offer more, but Japanese government officials said its large China operations raised the risk that technology would leak.Toshiba said the Japanese government-led plan is the \u201cbest proposal, not only in terms of valuation, but also in respect to certainty of closing, retention of employees, and maintenance of sensitive technology within Japan.\u201dThe Toshiba chip unit is enjoying a demand boom for NAND flash memory, in which it trails only             Samsung Electronics Co.       in market share, according to IHS Markit.But Toshiba has fallen behind rivals in securing critical supplies for next year\u2019s production, people familiar with the matter said last week. If Japanese government-backed entities take control, one challenge would be finding the billions of dollars needed every year for investments to remain competitive.China\u2019s government-backed Tsinghua Unigroup, which last year acquired state-owned chip maker XMC, is catching up technologically with a financial boost from Beijing. The group has made unsuccessful efforts to buy or tie up with chip makers including SK Hynix, Western Digital and             Micron Technology Inc.Japan Display Inc.,       which supplies screens to smartphone makers including Apple, is also controlled by Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, and struggles to stay ahead in technology because of a constant shortage of cash.Toshiba shares have risen more than 60% from their recent low in mid-April on expectations that the chip-unit sale will allow the company to regain its footing. The shares closed down 2.2% in Wednesday trading after the announcement.\u2014Kosaku Narioka in Tokyo, Eva Dou in Beijing and Timothy W.

MSCI 0.57%       said it would consider classifying the kingdom as an emerging market as early as next year, a move that could potentially divert billions of dollars into the Middle East\u2019s biggest economy and boost appetite for oil giant Saudi Aramco\u2019s planned share sale.The Saudi Stock Exchange\u2019s benchmark Tadawul All Share Index rose 5.5% to close at 7334.8.Investor sentiment was boosted by the elevation of Mohammed bin Salman to crown prince, a move that clarifies the succession plan in Saudi Arabia, analysts say, and strengthens the young leader\u2019s mandate to steer the kingdom\u2019s ambitious program to reshape its energy-dependent economy.Those overhauls, which include the opening of the stock market to international investors to attract more foreign capital, were cited by MSCI as part of the reason for Saudi Arabia\u2019s inclusion in its watch list.In its annual market classification review announced late on Tuesday, MSCI said it is launching a consultation on Saudi Arabia\u2019s potential inclusion. The kingdom could win the coveted emerging-market tag in June 2018 depending on feedback from foreign investors, especially on accessibility to the region\u2019s biggest stock market.If it is successful in clinching the classification in next year\u2019s review, Saudi Arabia could be included in the index by June 2019, analysts say.That tag could potentially help Saudi Aramco secure billions of dollars in additional investments from global funds that track such benchmarks. The oil giant plans to list shares worth tens of billions of dollars in 2018 on Saudi Arabia\u2019s main stock market and is also considering other global bourses, in what is likely to be the world\u2019s biggest initial public offering.An emerging-market classification by compilers such as MSCI can help attract billions in additional inflows from funds that use such gauges. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index, for instance, is tracked by money managers with some $1.6 trillion of assets.\u201cInclusion into MSCI EM will put Saudi, and the MENA [Middle East and North Africa] region, firmly on the radar of international investors,\u201d said Bassel Khatoun, chief investment officer for MENA equities at Franklin Templeton Investments.For Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to attract more foreign capital in its push to diversify away from its dependence on oil revenue, an emerging market classification will potentially give its listed companies easier access to increased funding sources.Investment bank EFG Hermes estimates Saudi Arabia could account for about 2.4% of MSCI\u2019s emerging markets index if included, which would result in about $7 billion of inflows from global passive funds.\u201cAn emerging-market index inclusion for Saudi Arabia is also critical for the Aramco IPO,\u201d said Mohamad Al Hajj, an analyst at EFG. \u201cIt will fast-track Aramco\u2019s inclusion in such indexes, which will lead to billions of dollars in investments,\u201d he added.Saudi Arabia\u2014one of the last major markets globally to restrict international investments\u2014opened its doors to foreign investors in June 2015. The move came as the kingdom grappled with a sharp fall since the middle of 2014 in the price of oil, which makes up a majority of the government\u2019s budget revenues.Saudi Arabia and many of its oil-exporting Persian Gulf neighbors have since adopted several measures to reshape their economies to cope with cheap energy prices. The kingdom in 2016 unveiled plans to more than triple its non-oil revenue by 2020, while cutting back on spending and reducing some subsidies as part of an initiative called the National Transformation Program.Saudi Arabia\u2019s addition to the MSCI watch list \u201creflects the kingdom\u2019s significant progress in capital market reform in support of\u201d the transformation program, said Sarah Al Suhaimi, chairwoman of the Saudi Stock Exchange.A vital part of that diversification effort is the listing of Aramco, whose assets Saudi Arabia plans to transfer into the Public Investment Fund, the sovereign-wealth fund leading its global investments drive.Foreign investments in Saudi Arabia\u2019s stock market have been slower than most expected owing to some restrictions, many of which have been eased now. The regulator in the past year has implemented several key overhauls, including changes in April to the settlement cycle of listed securities and a proper delivery versus payment settlement provision, which foreign investors prefer.These changes have brought Saudi Arabia closer to emerging-market accessibility standards. MSCI usually seeks feedback from investors during the review period on the effectiveness of rules that markets implement, especially those related to accessibility.MSCI said Tuesday it would be consulting with international institutional investors \u201cto gather informed feedback on their practical experience of accessing the Saudi equity markets and in particular on the effectiveness of the recently implemented enhancements.\u201dBanking stocks were among the top gainers on Wednesday as investors also cheered the Saudi King Saman\u2019s move to restore retrospectively all the perks and benefits of state employees, which were halted last year as part of austerity measures to narrow the kingdom\u2019s budget deficit and then reinstalled in April.Write to Nikhil Lohade at Nikhil.Lohade@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 12:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/msci-to-consider-saudi-arabia-for-emerging-market-classification-1498009582", "news_title": "Saudi Stocks Rally on Possible Emerging Market Classification", "keywords": "benchmark,emerging market,index,investment,msci,oil revenue,MSCI,Saudi Aramco,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,printing,publishing,database,directory publishing,retail,wholesale,motor vehicle dealing,specialty stores,integrated oil,gas,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "When Emmy nominations are announced next month, music supervisors will be competing for the first time ever, after being granted an award category of their own. But long before the Sept. 17 awards ceremony, supervisors are wondering how Emmy voters will evaluate excellence for a job that is more subtle and complicated than it sounds: selecting the soundtrack for scenes in TV shows.One of the episodes that music supervisor Maggie Phillips submitted for Emmy contention is from \u201cFargo.\u201d It includes a montage scene in which two characters strut their way into a bridge tournament. The contestants\u2019 slow-motion entrance is accompanied by a tune with a propulsive beat, tight horn riffs and lyrics that are total gibberish. \u201cPrisencolinensinainciusol\u201d was recorded in 1972 by an Italian singer,       Adriano Celentano,        replicating the sound of American English.The song is catchy, cool and obscure, but Ms. Phillips says it was chosen more for the way it underscores the relationship between the two characters, an ex-con and her parole officer, in a romance that soon involves murder. The tune\u2019s swagger symbolizes the confidence they give one another, but its nonsense lyrics telegraph that the bravado is hollow.When music clicks in a scene on multiple levels, it is hard to imagine substituting any other song, Ms. Phillips says. \u201cTempo, instruments, vocals. It all sums up to something that transforms the picture you\u2019re seeing in front of you. That\u2019s when I feel like I created something, by putting two separate things together to make something new.\u201dTV has been on a tear in the last decade, opening the door for unconventional creativity in everything from cinematography to soundtracks. At the same time, the in-depth online analysis of certain shows helped raise the profile of behind-the-scenes pros such as music supervisors. As links between the worlds of TV and music, they have also emerged as influential allies of musicians looking for exposure. To help viewers connect with TV music, some supervisors verify the songs they use with websites and apps that identify them, such as Tunefind and Shazam.An official embrace by the television industry was slower to come. After forming the Guild of Music Supervisors in 2010 (which includes members working in film, advertising, games and other mediums) ambassadors for the craft made inroads with the organization that runs the Emmys, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Starting in 2015, music supervisors were allowed to join the Academy as members of the music branch, which oversees awards for music direction (typically performance shows) and composition.Unlike composers, however, supervisors more often come from the DJ world than the conservatory. Initially, there was some reluctance \u201cas to why they\u2019d allow us into their group,\u201d says       Thomas Golubi\u0107,        a co-founder of the music supervisors guild. \u201cA lot of composers really don\u2019t know what supervisors do. Or maybe they had bad experiences. That created a little bit of confusion.\u201dThis year, the Academy voted to add the music-supervision category (along with a new Emmy for reality-series casting). Music supervisors have submitted about 90 entries, the Academy says. Voting on nominees ends Monday. All Emmy nominees will be announced July 13, ahead of the September awards show.Neither the Academy Awards nor the Golden Globes honor music supervisors.Supervisors had to supplement their Emmy submissions with written answers to 10 questions, such as: \u201cWhat was your creative contribution to advancing the story line in the episode submitted?\u201d and \u201cHow did your work support character development?\u201dJen Ross, music supervisor for the hip-hop drama \u201cEmpire,\u201d submitted a song-packed episode that bounces among Eminem,       Thelonious Monk       and an original tune that addressed gun violence. In one scene record-label bosses meet with mogul Lucious Lyon, played by       Terrence Howard.       A decadent song by French Montana and Drake (\u201cNo Shopping\u201d) transitions to a triumphant one from Frank Sinatra and Count Basie\u2019s orchestra (\u201cThe Best Is Yet to Come\u201d).The contrast could seem abrupt \u201cbut is absolutely believable in the world of Lucious Lyon,\u201d Ms. Ross says. \u201cJust like real human beings, the characters are shaped by the music that surrounds them.\u201dIf there is skepticism about the creativity required of music supervisors, their bureaucratic-sounding job title probably doesn\u2019t help. Then again, the job does bring avalanches of red tape.\u201cClearing\u201d a song for use in television often requires supervisors to be both detective and haggler. For each song, they need to secure two distinct licenses\u2014one for the sound recording and one for the written composition. Ownership of these rights can be split among many parties. The supervisor must find them all, get their permission to use the song in the scene, and then settle on a fee.\u201cAtlanta\u201d music supervisor Jen Malone found herself dealing with court-appointed lawyers to negotiate with the estate of a rapper who was shot to death in 2013. Only 10 seconds of \u201cLet Me Find Out\u201d by Montgomery, Ala., native Doe B can be heard in the first episode of the FX series as it plays on the car stereo of an underground rapper and his sidekick. Despite the hassle, the song was a more authentic choice for those characters than \u201csomething you would hear on the radio in L.A.,\u201d says Ms. Malone, who often tracks down emerging southern rappers and producers with direct messages on Instagram and             Twitter.       With \u201cAtlanta\u201d creator Donald Glover, she co-submitted an episode for Emmy contention that peaks with the Funkadelic song \u201cHit It and Quit It.\u201dFor the AMC series \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d Mr. Golubi\u0107 and his team consider hundreds of pre-existing songs for each musical moment. After winnowing them down to about 20, they play them against the scene and debate how the songs interact with the scene through their mood, lyrics and tempo. Before selecting a handful of the songs to edit into the scene and present to the show\u2019s creators for a final decision, Mr. Golubi\u0107 gets preapproval to license the songs from their rights holders; he learned not to suggest songs without knowing that he can deliver them.\u201cSometimes the amount of research is epic, going to the far corners of the world [to track down licensing approvals] under the hopes that maybe we\u2019ll pitch the song\u201d to \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d producers, says Mr. Golubi\u0107, who submitted an episode of the series that showcased acts from Little Richard to Norwegian producer       Todd Terje.However, Emmy voters won\u2019t be awarding points for behind-the-scenes maneuvering, such as the deal-making it took Ms. Phillips to land two       Pink Floyd       songs\u2014\u201cBreathe (In the Air)\u201d and \u201cOn the Run\u201d\u2014from \u201cThe Dark Side of the Moon\u201d in the finale of \u201cLegion,\u201d an FX series that explores an overlap between mental illness and superpowers.\u201cThe big feat was getting Pink Floyd for an affordable price,\u201d Ms. Phillips says, \u201cI\u2019m not going to win an Emmy for that but I wish I could because we got it for half price, and [songwriter]       Roger Waters       didn\u2019t approve it until about half an hour before\u2019 the show\u2019s final deadline.\u201dMusic supervisors are especially tuned into the songs selected by their colleagues working on other shows. Below, supervisors pick their favorite songs that their peers used during this television season.Music supervisor: PJ Bloom (\u201cThe Americans,\u201d \u201cFeud: Bette and Joan,\u201d \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d)Song: \u201cWherever I May Roam,\u201d by ApocalypticaScene: In HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d (music supervisor: Liza Richardson), a Metallica song performed by a group of cellists underscores the tension in a scene involving an aborted suicide attempt.\u2018They significantly edited the song structure to score the sequence, altering it with pauses and rests to accentuate the action,\u2019 Mr. Bloom says. \u2018More often than not songs are simply laid in, ramped up then faded out against picture. It\u2019s a lazy approach. When a music team takes the time to finesse a song into the action it truly becomes a character within the sequence.\u2019Music supervisor:       Zach Cowie       (\u201cMaster of None\u201d)Song: \u201cPrisencolinensinainciusol\u201d by Adriano Celentano.Scene: Two characters in FX\u2019s \u201cFargo\u201d (music supervisor: Maggie Phillips), make a swaggering, slow-motion entrance into a bridge competition.\u201cI love this weirdo single and was thrilled to see it find a new audience\u2014observing that phenomenon is truly one of the greater joys associated with this job,\u201d Mr. Cowie says, adding, \u201cGenerally speaking I\u2019m a fan of any montage with a slow-motion walk and this is no exception.\u201dMusic supervisor: Liza Richardson (\u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d \u201cBull,\u201d \u201cThe Path\u201d)Song: \u201cI\u2019m So Green\u201d by CanScene: In Showtime\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Dying Up Here\u201d (music supervisor: Gabe Hilfer), set in the Los Angeles comedy scene of the 1970s, one stand-up tries to mentally sabotage his peers before a crucial audition.\u201cLoved it,\u201d Ms. Richardson says, noting that songs by the vintage German rock band rarely surface on television. \u201cI\u2019m a huge Can fan and was delighted to hear it.\u201dMusic supervisor: Jen Ross (\u201cEmpire,\u201d \u201cStar,\u201d \u201cPower,\u201d \u201cQuantico\u201d)Song: \u201cThe End\u201d by The DoorsScene: In the finale of FX\u2019s \u201cFeud: Bette and Joan\u201d (music supervisor: PJ Bloom), Joan Crawford faces a humiliating end to her Hollywood career as she acts in a B-movie called \u201cTrog.\u201dSays Ms. Ross, \u201cThat was a bold and dangerous move to go with an iconic song like that, because everyone has their own attachment to it. But I thought that this was deliciously and delightfully poetic and painful at the same time.\u201dMusic supervisor: Jen Malone (\u201cAtlanta,\u201d \u201cBaskets,\u201d \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d)Song: \u201cUp the Beach\u201d by Jane\u2019s AddictionScene: The main character in FX\u2019s \u201cLegion\u201d (music supervisor: Maggie Phillips), unleashes superhuman mental powers, sending people and objects flying in ultra slow motion.\u2018I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw Jane\u2019s Addiction used in that way. I spent two weeks listening to them after that,\u2019 Ms. Malone says.Music supervisor: Season Kent (\u201c13 Reasons Why,\u201d \u201cGirlboss,\u201d various superhero shows on the CW)Song: \u201cWhere Did I Go\u201d by Jorja SmithScene: In HBO\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d (music supervisor: Kier Lehman), the character played by Issa Rae makes music and a relationship connection in a recording studio.\u201cI don\u2019t normally work on hip hop/R&B-driven shows, so there was lots of discovery for me\u201d in watching \u201cInsecure,\u201d Ms. Kent says.Music supervisor: Thomas Golubi\u0107 (\u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d)Song: \u201cSay Hello, Wave Goodbye\u201d by Soft CellScene: After       Aziz Ansari\u2019s       character in             Netflix\u2019s       \u201cMaster of None\u201d (music supervisor: Zach Cowie), drops off a woman he has fallen for, the entire song plays out as the camera rests on his face during the cab ride home.Using a seemingly corny song from the 1980s was \u201ca curveball,\u201d Mr. Golubi\u0107 says. However, \u201cthe song lets you work your way through the scene. There\u2019s a little bit of space to it and a certain friction, and a really emotionally satisfying chorus.\u201dMusic supervisor:       Stephanie Diaz-Matos       (\u2018The Get Down\u2019)Song: \u201cLet Me Be Your Star,\u201d from \u201cSmash\u201dScene: Manish Raval is the music supervisor for \u201cGirls,\u201d but actor       Andrew Rannells       and the show\u2019s writers picked this song (from a short-lived TV show about a Broadway show) for his character to sing in his audition for a Broadway adaptation of \u201cWhite Men Can\u2019t Jump.\u201d\u201cThe nuance and insight in this episode had me in stitches. It was such a great layered reference for him to sing \u201cLet Me Be Your Star\u201d and the earnestness of his delivery really sells it so well,\u201d says Ms. Diaz-Matos.

Here\u2019s how Prince Mohammed\u2019s promotion could change Saudi Arabia.1) AramcoPrince Mohammed bin Salman has championed an initial public offering of the state-run oil giant known as Aramco, despite some opposition at home by those who fear he\u2019s selling the country\u2019s crown jewel. Yet the prince will likely go ahead with the Aramco IPO\u2014which is expected to raise about $100 billion\u2014to provide funds for the country\u2019s main sovereign-wealth fund, which is in charge of helping diversify the Saudi economy, and to advance the opening of the local stock market.2) EconomyMohammed bin Salman is seen as the architect of Saudi Arabia\u2019s plan to wean itself off its oil dependence. He has removed energy subsidies and curbed public sector perks. He\u2019s also shown flexibility: To stave off public discontent, he has reinstated some of those perks. The balancing act is all about creating a more nimble economy that will generate jobs for a burgeoning youth population without alienating those who fear being left behind.3) SocietyUnder Mohammed bin Salman, the historically insular Saudi society has cracked open. He\u2019s reined in the religious police and allowed a growing number of entertainment initiatives, like music concerts and even moderndance shows. He\u2019s also met with amusement theme park executives who are keen on setting up shop in Saudi Arabia. The aim is to cultivate a more livable environment at home, so that many young Saudis aren\u2019t heading overseas to work and travel.4) IranSunni-majority Saudi Arabia considers predominantly Shiite Iran the biggest threat in the region. The two countries are already at loggerheads in other parts of the Middle East such as Syria and Yemen. Mohamed bin Salman has ruled out any rapprochement with the Iranian government. The tensions are expected to deepen existing conflicts in the Middle East and could even produce an arms race in the region. Inside the Saudi kingdom, there is the risk of a disenfranchised Shiite minority which, if further marginalized, could become a growing source of social unrest.5) Foreign PolicyFor better or worse, Prince Mohammed bin Salman is associated with Saudi Arabia\u2019s costly intervention in Yemen. Behind the intervention is an effort to dislodge the Houthi rebels, which many in Saudi Arabia view as proxies for Iran. More than two years after the conflict began, Houthi rebels still control the capital, at the cost of billions of dollars and thousands of lives. More recently, Saudi Arabia led a group of states cutting off diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing their Persian Gulf neighbor of harboring terrorists and meddling with other countries\u2019 internal affairs. The conflicts are a sign to some that a more powerful Prince Mohammed bin Salman means a more turbulent Middle East.Write to Nicolas Parasie at nicolas.parasie@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 11:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-things-about-saudi-arabias-new-crown-prince-1498060121", "news_title": "Five Things About Saudi Arabia\u2019s New Crown Prince ", "keywords": "aramco,arms race,heir to the throne,initial public offering,middle east,new heir,saudi crown prince,successor,Mohammed bin Salman,political,general news,political appointments,terminations,politics,international relations,domestic politics,royal families,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,oil exploration,natural gas"}, {"content": "June Chu,        a Yale University dean who was put on leave last month after being tied to a string of racially insensitive reviews on             Yelp,       has formally left the school.Head of Pierson College       Stephen Davis       wrote in a letter Tuesday that Ms. Chu left her position at the school \u201cand wishes the best to the students.\u201dMs. Chu didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email inquiry, or to a message left on a cellphone number listed under her name.Ms. Chu, who taught psychology and Asian-American studies and was dean of the residential Pierson College, apologized in mid-May for two reviews that were deemed offensive and assured administrators and students those were the only such posts.

The airline cut some flight frequencies on U.S. routes.The U.S. said it imposed the ban because of concerns terrorists were trying to smuggle bombs on board planes.\u201cThe markets are coming back to us now,\u201d said       Tim Clark,        president of\u00a0Emirates, the world\u2019s largest airline by international traffic.The airline has restored daily service to Orlando, Fla., and may also restore others.Mr. Clark said he visited Washington recently to discuss the issue with U.S. security officials. He told them that Dubai\u2019s airport had advanced security facilities but was willing to make any upgrades the U.S. would demand. U.S. officials could even oversee processes in Dubai, he said.\u201cThey were hugely sympathetic to the problems it is giving us,\u201d Mr. Clark said.He expressed optimism the U.S. would issue guidelines for the industry on what security measures it would require in return for lifting the ban.Qatar Airways Chief Executive       Akbar Al Baker       this week said he had invited U.S. officials to audit his Doha hub. The airport also is on the U.S. list affected by the electronics ban.At a meeting in Malta last week, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke presented their European counterparts with a list of extra security measures that included improved information exchange, random testing for explosives and acquiring more advanced airport-screening devices to forestall a ban, said a European Union official who participated. The Americans gave no deadlines when presenting the measures, this person said, and many already are in place.Emirates\u00a0and its regional rivals, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, had enjoyed a period of rapid growth, using their Persian Gulf airports as transfer hubs for long-haul flights between Asia and the U.S. and Europe. Now they have hit a rough patch. Low oil prices have depressed business travel. An oversupply of seats has depressed ticket prices. The laptop ban was only the latest hit.Emirates\u00a0last month said full-year net profit plunged 82%. Mr. Clark said business in the first few months of this year is ahead of the same period last year. Still, he said, \u201cwe have to adapt our business model.\u201dOn the agenda is working more closely with its budget sister airline, FlyDubai.\u201cWe could do things better together than apart,\u201d Mr. Clark said. The move is being pushed by\u00a0Emirates\u00a0Group\u2019s government owner, he said.When FlyDubai was founded in 2008, 23 years after the more widely known\u00a0Emirates\u00a0Airline, it didn\u2019t do enough to enable cooperation, Mr. Clark said. Details of the cooperation are to be rolled out in the coming 18 months, Mr. Clark said, adding that nothing is off the table.Emirates\u00a0Airline, known for its lavish service, already has introduced elements more associated with lower-service airlines such as paid-for seat selection. \u201cThere are other things coming,\u201d Mr. Clark said.Mr. Clark said\u00a0Emirates, which operates big planes such as Airbus SE A380 superjumbos and             Boeing Co.       777 widebodies, has been considering also buying some short-haul planes.

EQT\u2019s last fund, which was raised less than three years ago, targeted \u20ac5.25 billion before closing on its \u20ac6.75 billion hard cap in September 2015.Investors are scrambling to invest in buyout funds as private equity has outperformed other asset classes, which has led to a string of private-equity fundraising records being set in recent months.Buyout funds world-wide generated an annualized return of 15.3% in the three years to September\u2014sharply higher than the 5.6% return hedge funds delivered to investors over the same period. Hedge funds compete with private equity for capital that investors allocate to alternative assets.Private-equity houses also delivered better returns than public equity markets in 2016, according to Bain & Co.\u2019s Global Private Equity Report 2017. Data collected by Cambridge Associates found that buyout funds in Europe delivered a 10% internal rate of return in 2016, while the MSCI Europe fell 11%. In the U.S., funds delivered a 6% pooled internal rate against 4% for the S&P 500 for the 12 months ended June 2016.Investors and advisers are expecting demand for EQT\u2019s next fund to be strong, following a number of recent speedy fundraisings by big-name firms.One investor said EQT\u2019s fund, as with CVC Capital Partners\u2019 and Silver Lake\u2019s most recent funds, could be oversubscribed. Another investor said EQT is likely to hold a single first-and-final close next year, following in the footsteps of CVC and Cinven, other buyout firms. Firms typically hold a series of interim closes unless there is strong appetite from investors.EQT\u2019s fundraising plans come on the heels of two sizable exits for the firm. EQT sold Netherlands-based business-information company Bureau van Dijk to             Moody\u2019s Corp.       for \u20ac3 billion in May, having paid \u20ac1.6 billion for the company in July 2014, said a person familiar with the matter. It sold German bandage maker BSN for \u20ac2.7 billion to Swedish paper company SCA in December after paying \u20ac1.8 billion in 2012.The largest private-equity managers have found it easy to raise capital over the past 18 months as investors grapple with a low-growth environment.Private equity\u2019s outperformance has helped big-name private-equity houses raise record-beating funds this year\u2014and strengthened their hand when negotiating terms with investors.CVC, which set a new fundraising record for a European buyout firm this month when it announced it had raised \u20ac16 billion, cut its so-called hurdle rate\u2014the return threshold firms must deliver to investors before they can take a share of investment profits\u2014to 6%, below the industry standard of 8%. An investor said that the firm had received demand of \u201cnorth of \u20ac20 billion\u201d for the fund.This month, U.S. private-equity giant             KKR & Co.                   collected $9.3 billion for the biggest-ever Asia-focused buyout fund.The North American fundraising record also is set to fall as             Apollo Global Management                   LLC seeks to raise $23.5 billion for its ninth fund, eclipsing the $21.7 billion raised by             Blackstone Capital Partners                  \u2019 sixth fund in 2007.Write to William Louch at william.louch@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 11:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eqt-gears-up-to-launch-giant-flagship-fund-1498058844", "news_title": "EQT Gears Up to Launch Giant Flagship Fund", "keywords": "political,general news,real estate,property,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Giant bond firms increasingly are taking on a price-setting role in global debt markets, elbowing aside big banks facing tighter postcrisis regulation and generating concerns about the toll paid by smaller investors.The bond funds, which traditionally turned to banks for prices, are usurping the role as banks face pressure to reduce risk. Banks still act as middlemen in bond trading, but what trading they do is directed at bigger funds, say bankers and fund managers. Smaller funds have less service and higher costs in trading, say many money managers who work for themWhile bigger bond investors have long had advantages, the differences have become more pronounced.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that bank balance sheets are much more constrained than they used to be,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., which oversees $54 billion, and this \u201chas shifted the relative importance of players in the market.\u201dWhat\u2019s happening in bond markets would be similar to a retail sector in which wholesalers\u2014a role played by banks in financial markets\u2014were scaling back their business. Small retailers would struggle to stock up, but big-box stores with their mega warehouses and access to international producers would get by fine.Before the financial crisis,       Jay Sommariva,        portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group, a Pittsburgh firm that manages $1.5 billion, would call a few banks to sell a bond and it would be snatched up within hours, he says. Now, he says, it takes at least a couple of days, and the cut that the bank takes is much greater.For every billion dollars of bonds outstanding in U.S. markets, dealer banks held only $8 million in stock in 2016, one-third the amount in 2008, according to the Federal Reserve and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. This change has made trading choppier, research published by the Fed last month suggested.It is also shifting the balance of power away from banks and small funds, investors say, and into the hands of the largest asset managers.In recent years, whenever Mr. Sommariva wanted to sell a bond, banks would normally only buy it if they had someone lined up to sell it to, he said. Big funds say that this someone is them.\u201cThey\u2019ll call us, Pimco, BlackRock, and ask \u2018Can you take that on?\u2019\u201d said       Gregory Peters,        a senior fund manager at PGIM Fixed Income, part of PGIM Inc., an asset manager that oversees $1 trillion. \u201cIt\u2019s really Darwinian when it comes to size.\u201dThis approach wasn\u2019t as common pre-2008, when banks could buy the bond on the spot and wait to sell it when a buyer was willing to meet their price.Taking the bond off the banks\u2019 hands, however, is a service done only for a good price, Mr. Peters added, giving firms like his an edge.Who is getting the short end of the deal? Banks are being hit because they have less flexibility in trading, and because asset managers now have more analysts, more data and electronic tools that allow them to trade directly with one another, analysts say.\u201cA client has a lot of transparency now and, in many ways, more than a dealer,\u201d said       Chris Orr,        co-head of European investment-grade credit trading at Swiss bank             Credit Suisse Group AG      .But ultimately, if banks trade less, it is the small investor who suffers, analysts say. Smaller asset managers are reliant on banks; they don\u2019t have the capacity to stockpile bonds themselves.To be sure, banks have long given better prices to bigger funds sending larger orders, because they bring in more fees\u2014trading small blocks can be five times as pricey as doing it in bulk, managers said. Smaller funds are also trying to adapt and play to their strengths, they say, for example by holding less-traded bonds for longer.Large asset managers, meanwhile, are adapting to their new role, and behaving more like banks used to.Now, instead of just calling banks for quotes on bonds, big funds often amass large stockpiles of their own and then call banks to tell them at what price they are willing to sell, said David Lloyd, head of institutional public debt at M&G Investments, a \u00a3265 billion ($335 billion) asset manager.It is hard to pin down the cost of trading because it varies depending on the risk and maturity of the asset, as well as daily moves. Large funds say that roughly 1% of the money they can make on a bond may be spent on buying or selling it to a bank, with some reporting only slight increases since the crisis.Some smaller funds say that for them, this cost could go up to 15%, an increase of roughly a fifth after 2008.Larger funds tend to outperform smaller ones, although there are many other possible reasons. Individual U.S. dollar corporate-debt funds larger than $1 billion returned a cumulative 61% between 2008 and 2016, while those managing less than that yielded only 48%, according to data by fund tracker             Morningstar Inc.And small funds face myriad new problems. Swaths of postcrisis regulation are costlier to handle for smaller investors. Customers are migrating en masse to low-cost index funds, and large firms hold 88% of those assets, Morningstar says.\u201cThe bigger you are the better off you are,\u201d said Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors, which manages more than $400 billion.Write to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 11:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-the-new-bond-market-bigger-is-better-1498046401", "news_title": "In the New Bond Market, Bigger Is Better", "keywords": "bond funds,bond investors,bond markets,Brown Brothers Harriman,Chris Orr,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,debt,commodity,financial market news,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "FRANKFURT\u2014German exports to Asia are rising strongly this year in a trend that could mitigate the risks to Europe\u2019s largest economy should U.S. President       Donald Trump       make good on his protectionist promises.Figures released on Wednesday showed Germany\u2019s exports to China rising around 12% in the first four months of the year compared with the same period in 2016. Exports to India rose by a similar rate, while shipments to Indonesia and Vietnam jumped more than 20% each from January to April 2016, according to the Federal Statistical Office.\u201cWe are benefiting from our excellent positioning in East Asia and strong demand for consumer electronics,\u201d said       Robert Saller,        a managing director at DELO, a family-run producer of special adhesives for electronic devices.

Economists warn that a U.S.-led shift away from free trade will hurt economic growth and prosperity globally.Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized Germany for its large trade surplus with the U.S. and threatened to impose tariffs on German car imports. But action by the U.S. administration has proved modest while German businesses have remained committed to the large U.S. market.German exports to the U.S. rose 3.9% in the first four months of 2017 from the same period last year. Exports to the U.K. fell by around 4%.VIEW InteractiveGiven increased tensions between Europe and the U.S. over issues such as climate and free trade, European leaders have redoubled efforts to cultivate China. German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       and Chinese Premier       Li Keqiang       met in Berlin earlier this month, and Mr. Li stressed that both parties were \u201cin favor of fostering free trade and the simplification of investment.\u201dGerman businesses\u2019 rising exports to Asia draw on a long record in the region. Economists say that China\u2019s One Belt, One Road initiative\u2014-a series of vast infrastructure projects to connect mainland China with the rest of the continent-\u2014will open up more opportunities for trade.Last year, China became Germany\u2019s largest trading partner, with combined imports and exports of almost \u20ac200 billion ($223 billion).Five years from now, the Europe Union\u2019s export revenues with Asia will be almost twice its export revenues with the U.S., estimated Charles-Edouard Bou\u00e9e, chief executive of Roland Berger. \u201cWe are very positive on the outlook for Asia,\u201d Mr. Bou\u00e9e said.The regional shift is already visible in Germany\u2019s trade statistics today. New data by the Federal Statistical Office show that German companies exported goods worth \u20ac66.9 billion to Asia in the first four months of this year, compared with shipments of \u20ac37.4 billion to the U.S.German companies\u2019 reputation for quality engineering and a mix of specialized goods, including capital goods used to build factories and infrastructure, have long been a vital ingredient in the country\u2019s export prowess.Germany is the third largest exporter in the world after China and the U.S. and exposed to a variety of regions, which has helped the country\u2019s exporters weather economic shocks in specific markets in the past.Write to Nina Adam at nina.adam@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'German Exporters See Surge In Asia.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 11:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-exports-to-asia-surge-calming-nerves-over-protectionist-backlash-1498051572", "news_title": "German Exports to Asia Surge, Calming Nerves Over Protectionist Backlash", "keywords": " chinese imports, free trade, g-20, german economy,german exports, german trade, trump's trade policy,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,tariffs,trade barriers,machinery,industrial goods"}, {"content": "Q: I am afflicted with Age-Related Macular Degeneration, which impairs my ability to read.

The ReadMate\u2019s lens measures only about 2.75 inches in diameter, but because it\u2019s elevated on a metal base, the view is wide enough to span the narrower columns of most newspapers.Although not quite as portable, the Jumbomag($25, amazon.com)) might suit your needs as well. Similar to the ReadMate, it also offers a 5X magnification and LEDs, but this model sits on top of a lightweight plastic base and is rechargeable via USB (instead of the ReadMate\u2019s coin-cell batteries). With a lens that\u2019s just under 3.25 inches, the Jumbomag is ideal for wider columns of text, since less sliding back and forth is required.If you\u2019re looking for a more traditional product, consider the XL Prism Magnifier($65, areaware.com). Made entirely of crystal glass, this triangle-shaped magnifier measures about 4 inches at its widest point\u2014the biggest of the bunch. Although its stated magnification level is only 1.5X, text viewed through it appears roughly the same size as the above models. The XL Prism doesn\u2019t offer a built-in light or any other bells and whistles, but it does serve as a handsome, sculptural desk accessory.\u2014Have lifestyle problem that a gadget might solve?

Many other countries have shown that it just plain works better than having a government bureaucracy directing airplanes.Air-traffic control, known as ATC, depends on technology. Better tools can improve safety, shorten flights, get planes out of turbulence faster and reduce delays. And privatized ATC providers in Canada, the U.K., Australia and elsewhere have shown they can modernize and continuously upgrade faster than the Federal Aviation Administration.On some key functions, the FAA is more than a decade behind.The Transportation Department\u2019s inspector general,       Calvin Scovel,        told Congress in May that while the FAA is doing better with modernization, two decades of reform efforts have still fallen short.FAA Administrator       Michael Huerta,        an       Obama       appointee, and other senior officials in the trenches on air-traffic control say the FAA just isn\u2019t structured to be a high-tech developer and operator. They argue splitting the agency would let it focus on safety regulation of airlines and air-traffic controllers instead of the potentially conflicting role of being the watchdog over its own controllers. The controllers\u2019 union also supports the idea after seeing the technology other countries are using and facing the threat of furlough in past budget showdowns.Privatized ATC organizations say their big advantage, in addition to steady funding and borrowing, is that they can continuously take on small projects that make incremental improvements. When you\u2019re a government agency begging for appropriations, you pitch big, attention-getting programs. But big projects are exponentially more complex and prone to delay.Take London\u2019s Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest in the world. Strong headwinds cause big delays: If planes are spaced 5 miles apart and it takes longer to fly the 5 miles, fewer land each hour and some end up circling in holding patterns. So NATS Holdings Ltd., the United Kingdom\u2019s privatized air services provider, developed a tool to let controllers easily optimize spacing by time, not distance. Time is the key safety measure\u2014each plane needs enough to exit the runway before the next one touches down. When the tool went into use in 2015 after two years of development, headwind delays were reduced by 50%.Time-based separation could have a big impact at New York airports, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and others that don\u2019t always have enough runway capacity for arrivals. The FAA\u2019s NextGen plan acknowledges it could have major benefits. But it won\u2019t be operational for arrivals and approach until fiscal year 2022 at the earliest.Canada privatized its ATC operations more than 20 years ago and has since leapfrogged the U.S. in technology and cut costs\u201413% over the past 11 years.Flying in remote areas of Canada, pilots send text messages to controllers and get electronic responses. Requests for altitude changes are automatically checked for conflicts before they even pop up on controllers\u2019 screens. One mouse click can approve a request, update the plane\u2019s flight plan and alert other controllers. It\u2019s faster, more efficient and more accurate than U.S. procedures, and results in better flights for passengers.The FAA has implemented digital communications at 55 major airports to deliver flight plans on the ground. That saves time, especially in stormy situations where lots of flights are getting new routes, and can reduce errors. But communicating with airborne planes by text won\u2019t come until 2019 at the earliest.A privatized ATC organization could take many forms. In Canada, it\u2019s a nonprofit entity with a board of directors but no ownership shares. NATS in the U.K. is a for-profit, public-private partnership. German\u2019s ATC service is a government-owned, limited-liability company.Privatization was first proposed in Congress in 1974, but then and every time since it has failed to gain support. Sometimes Republicans like the idea; sometimes Democrats. President Reagan tried in the 1980s. President Clinton proposed an ATC corporation in 1995. Rep.       Bill Shuster,        the Republican chair of the House transportation and infrastructure committee, proposed legislation last year. It never got out of committee.Legislation is being drafted again, with White House backing. Proponents say they are making progress addressing many of the criticisms of past proposals. But the headwinds will again be stiff.Opponents warn of higher ticket prices. But passengers are already paying the full load for big bureaucracy through hefty taxes on their tickets. On a $400 domestic round-trip ticket with a connection, you pay $46.40 in FAA taxes and fees. In addition, airlines pay a fuel tax of 4.3 cents a gallon and a tax of 6.25% on cargo and mail.The $14.4 billion collected in fiscal year 2016 more than covered the $11.2 billion spent on the FAA\u2019s air-traffic organization, according to an analysis by       Robert Poole,        transportation policy director at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank. The rest paid for FAA safety regulation and helped fund some airport improvements.Privatized ATC organizations charge user fees instead of taxes. (There likely would still be some ticket tax to cover safety regulation and airport improvements.) There are required international guidelines on charges so fees don\u2019t get out of hand and limit travel. In many cases, charges end up getting reduced as organizations get more efficient and traffic increases.Business jets worry they\u2019ll have to pay what airlines pay\u2014they often take up the same airspace and require the same services. But most privatized providers charge by aircraft weight, so small jets pay less.Rural representatives are worried that airport improvement funding from the FAA might dry up, and that fees for private aviation would make it harder to get medical flights and business-jet trips important to their communities. Small private-plane owners worry they\u2019ll be hit with user fees every time they practice landings in a Cessna 172.Providers have concluded that making small planes pay small fees is a billing nightmare and would reduce safety. You don\u2019t want private pilots avoiding air-traffic controllers to save money. So service providers charge a one-time, required annual fee. In Canada, the annual fee for small propeller aircraft is aviation\u2019s best bargain: C$65, or about $49.New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and others argue airlines would have too much control. That depends on how you set up the board of directors. In Canada, airlines get four seats on a 15-member board.Some complain that sending government assets to a company would be a huge giveaway. Yet the current FAA infrastructure was paid for by travelers and shippers. If the new ATC organization had to buy the assets from the government, travelers and shippers would be paying for it a second time.What\u2019s clear to everyone is we need a better air-transportation system.Travelers deserve better. They already pay for it.Write to Scott McCartney at middleseat@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 11:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-for-privatizing-air-traffic-control-1498058006", "news_title": "The Case for Privatizing Air-Traffic Control", "keywords": "air traffic control,atc,faa,fees,giveaway,private,privatization,rural airports,small planes,taxes,Federal Aviation Administration,ownership changes,privatizations,nationalization,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,politics,international relations,domestic politics,travel,airports,air transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The State Department on Tuesday questioned the motives of Saudi Arabia and several of its allies that imposed an embargo on Qatar, breaking from President       Donald Trump\u2019s       vocal support for those aligned against the Gulf country.The Arab countries have isolated neighboring Qatar for the past two weeks, closing borders and canceling airline flights, while alleging that Doha has provided support for terrorist movements and maintained friendly relations with Iran, a bitter regional rival to Saudi Arabia and others.VIEW InteractiveQatar has protested the charges, but Mr. Trump has taken Saudi Arabia\u2019s side. \u201cThe nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level,\u201d he said in remarks at the White House on June 9.The State Department on Tuesday challenged the charges leveled by Qatar\u2019s regional critics, questioning whether they had evidence to back the allegations.\u201cWe are mystified that the Gulf states have not released to the public, nor to the Qataris, the details about the claims that they are making toward Qatar,\u201d State Department spokeswoman       Heather Nauert       said. \u201cThe more the time goes by, the more doubt is raised about the actions taken by Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.\u201d\u201cAt this point we are left with one simple question, were the actions really about their concerns regarding Qatar\u2019s alleged support for terrorism or were they about the long simmering grievances between and among the GCC countries?\u201d she said, referring to the seven-member Gulf Cooperation Council.Ms. Nauert, asked by a reporter whether the State Department was contradicting Mr. Trump, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think so at all. I think the president and the secretary both want to see this resolved. They want results and let\u2019s see this resolved quickly.\u201dSaudi and Qatari officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Addressing the apparent disagreement between the State Department\u2019s view of the dispute and Mr. Trump\u2019s charges against Qatar, a senior U.S. official said Mr. Trump was referring to past allegations of support from Qatar for terrorist movements.Mr. Trump\u2019s statements, however, appeared to address the current situation. Referring to the anti-Qatar push in a June 6 Twitter post, he wrote: \u201cPerhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!\u201dSecretary of State       Rex Tillerson       has been pursuing efforts to help bring about an end to the conflict between the Gulf states and Qatar, home to the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East.Several days after the conflict began, Mr. Tillerson called on Saudi Arabia and others to ease the blockade on Qatar. But Mr. Trump, who in May visited Saudi Arabia, appeared to take credit for the feud, saying his calls to crack down on terror financing during a trip to Saudi Arabia prompted the action against Qatar.Mr. Trump also has offered to mediate the conflict, though Mr. Tillerson believes the parties involved can work it out among themselves, Ms. Nauert said. Mr. Tillerson canceled a trip to Mexico this week so he could focus more on the Gulf diplomatic crisis.Since June 5, when Saudi Arabia and others imposed an embargo on Qatar, Mr. Tillerson has held more than 20 phone calls and meetings with Gulf Arab and other officials.The senior U.S. official said the Saudis and others haven\u2019t made a compelling case for the embargo publicly or in numerous meetings and phone calls privately.\u201cIf their motivations for doing this are so clear, then they should put it forward,\u201d the official said.Mr. Tillerson will continue holding meetings and phone calls to help the sides communicate, if not every day, then every other day, the official said.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.comAppeared in the June 21, 2017, print edition as 'State Department Challenges Arab Claims on Qatar.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 11:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-department-demands-saudis-prove-terror-allegations-against-qatar-1497998811", "news_title": "State Department Demands Saudis Prove Terror Allegations Against Qatar", "keywords": "gulf embargo,qatar embargo,saudi qatar ,tillerson qatar ,trump qatar,trump saudi arabia ,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,domestic politics,terrorism,government bodies,executive branch,state department,energy"}, {"content": "Google and YouTube have a responsibility for the content they make available, but advertisers also must make sure they are paying close attention to how they buy digital advertising, according to       Keith Weed,             Unilever\u2019s        UL 0.13%       chief marketing officer.Speaking at a panel event hosted by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, the well-known marketing executive said it\u2019s up to brands to take better advantage of the safeguards that are available to them and companies should be paying closer attention to how they use automated ad-buying systems.\u201cSome marketers likely have woken up to the fact that they might not have been on top of buying media in the way they thought,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say it\u2019s someone\u2019s fault [rather] than actually say, \u2018I should have been buying differently,\u2019\u201d he added.Part of the problem, Mr. Weed said, is that many advertisers are likely driving to find cheaper inventory, which tends to be \u201clow brow.\u201dIn March, a long list of companies such as PepsiCo, Inc., Wal-Mart Stores and             AT&T Inc.       pulled their ads from YouTube after ads were discovered running alongside objectionable content such as videos promoting terrorism. While many advertisers have begun to advertise on YouTube again, several big brands such as Procter & Gamble have not fully returned to the platform.Unilever, one of the world\u2019s largest advertisers with brands such as Dove and Hellman\u2019s mayonnaise, didn\u2019t pull out of YouTube after the brand safety firestorm erupted, because it didn\u2019t find a lot of problems with where its ads were appearing and the issues it did find were attributed to human error.The company decided to work through the problems rather than pull back, Mr. Weed said.Still, Mr. Weed said that marketers need to push to improve the overall digital advertising business.\u201cWe need to make sure the digital supply chain is less murky,\u201d he said, pointing to a wide range of issues such as bot fraud, lack of ad viewability and ad-blocking.Over the past few years, Unilever has been among the most aggressive at pushing for more transparency from Google and             Facebook.       A few years ago, Mr. Weed called for the tech giants to \u201cstop grading their own homework,\u201d and called for the industry to demand independent measurement of their digital advertising.The consumer product titan, along with other advertisers, has been successful in getting the digital giants to bend, in the past. In late 2015, Facebook and YouTube agreed to allow advertisers to use independent measurement firms to verify what portion of their ads can be seen by viewers.As more issues arise in the digital ad ecosystem, many marketers have signaled that they are placing more emphasis on having their ads appear on premium content. Unilever has found that its ads are more effective when they run alongside high quality content, Mr. Weed said.Write to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 11:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/unilever-cmo-says-marketers-must-take-more-responsibility-for-brand-safety-1498057576", "news_title": "Unilever CMO Says Marketers Must Take More Responsibility for Brand Safety ", "keywords": " brand safety,cannescmo,keith weed, unilever, youtube,Unilever,ULVR.LN,Keith Weed,marketing,markets,corporate,industrial news,food,beverages,tobacco,advertising,digital marketing,public relations,business,consumer services,consumer goods,food products"}, {"content": "The ascension of       Prince Mohammed bin Salman,        the architect of Riyadh\u2019s war in Yemen and its isolation of Qatar, as heir to the Saudi throne signals that the country feels emboldened to take a more assertive stance in the Mideast, Arab and Western diplomats say.The 31-year-old, who is known as MbS, has moved to win over the administration of President       Donald Trump,        while pursuing Riyadh\u2019s regional ambitions at a time when White House Middle East policy is in flux and it hasn\u2019t filled key positions in the State Department or Pentagon.The rise of the young prince comes at the expense of       Mohammed bin Nayef,        who served as crown prince and interior minister until\u00a0Wednesday, and has been a point man for Washington\u2019s counterterrorism efforts in the region, valued for his role in unraveling al Qaeda\u2019s network in the kingdom.Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s ascension suggests the country is doubling down on its recent moves to wield power to counter Iran and assert its military, which had largely been untested until its intervention in Yemen in 2015.\u201cFor the last two years, MbS was the one who had full control, he was the one who would fly to Moscow to meet with       Putin       or go to Washington and meet with Trump,\u201d\u00a0said a Saudi close to a powerful strain of the royal family.\u00a0\u201cHe was the man in charge, he was the man who spearheaded Yemen and Qatar, and he will keep doing this aggression.\u201dWestern and Arab diplomats say Riyadh will likely dedicate even more firepower to the Yemen war, after Mr. Trump cleared the way for increased arms sales to the kingdom last month. Riyadh this month also set out to isolate its neighbor Qatar, imposing an embargo, closing borders and canceling flights.The young Saudi prince\u2019s ascension is likely to be a double-edged sword for the White House as he pursues a policy that is in part aligned with the U.S. but also likely to lead to greater regional friction, said       Daniel Shapiro,        former national security adviser to the Obama administration. Saudi Arabia\u2019s moves to limit Iranian influence are supported by the U.S. and Israel.\u201cHe clearly wants to be an ally and leader of an alliance with the U.S. against Iran and Sunni extremists,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cAt the same time, he\u2019s demonstrated a willingness to be bold, some might say reckless, in the region.\u201dMohammed bin Salman\u2019s ascension was widely praised in the Gulf region, which largely follows Saudi\u2019s policy positions. The move was welcomed particularly in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the small but powerful United Arab Emirates.The deputy crown prince of Abu Dhabi and the leader of the U.A.E.\u2019s armed forces,       Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan,        has fostered a close relationship with Mohammed bin Salman, with the two going on vacations together and \u201ctexting in real time, all the time\u201d about everything from their families to Mideast strategy, according to advisers to both Abu Dhabi and Riyadh.Together with Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. has led the effort to isolate Qatar. Previous U.S. administrations had mediated past disputes between the three Gulf nations, working to prevent diplomatic issues to preserve American interests in the region\u2014including\u00a0the Middle East headquarters of U.S. Central Command, located at the al-Udeid base in Qatar.The growing power of the Emirati and Saudi duo illustrates the rise of more aggressive, youthful Arab leaders who are reshaping the Middle East\u2019s political landscape after years of a more passive approach by their older, and often ailing, predecessors. Mohammed bin Salman would be the first young Saudi king after a long line of septuagenarian and octogenarian leaders with little energy to take on reforms necessary to modernize the kingdom.\u201cEveryone realizes that the past Saudi Arabia was not sustainable from an economic, security or social perspective. Other [Saudi] leaders have recognized that but MbS has been the first to act on it,\u201d said an official close to both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. \u201cThe No. 1 strategic priority for the Emiratis is a secure and stable Saudi Arabia, even beyond the Iranian threat.\u201dFor Israel, the young prince appears to be a positive force that could lead to a more public engagement. The U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia have said they would have diplomatic ties with Israel if there were progress on resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and are considering the formation of an anti-Iran military alliance that would include intelligence-sharing.Israeli officials consider the crown prince to be a modernizer and partner in Israel\u2019s longstanding fight against Iran.\u201cIf he can succeed to change domestically Saudi Arabia\u2026he will gain enough legitimacy to change the attitude of the Arabs to many things, including Israel,\u201d said       Yaakov Amidror,       \u00a0former national security adviser to Israeli Prime Minister       Benjamin Netanyahu.Write to Maria Abi-Habib at maria.habib@wsj.com and Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 11:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/young-princes-rise-signals-a-more-aggressive-saudi-arabia-1498057452", "news_title": "Young Prince\u2019s Rise Signals a More Aggressive Saudi Arabia", "keywords": " crown prince, mohammed bin salman, saudi,saudi arabia,Prince Mohammed bin Salman"}, {"content": "Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s       promotion to become crown prince of Saudi Arabia will drive forward his plan to list the kingdom\u2019s state oil company and\u00a0strengthen his mandate to diversify its economy.The leadership shuffle removes almost all doubt that the Saudi state-run oil company, known as Saudi Aramco, will list a portion of its shares publicly\u2014a move driven by Prince Mohammed that has been opposed in parts of the country.Some people had feared Prince Mohammed\u2019s initiatives would stall or end if       Mohammed bin Nayef      \u2014the crown prince who was replaced Wednesday\u2014became king.\u201cThose dissenting voices will likely be silenced for now,\u201d said Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy for RBC Capital Markets, in a note to clients\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0morning. \u201cIt will be full steam ahead with the planned partial listing of Saudi Aramco.\u201dThe Aramco initial public offering has been billed as the most valuable listing ever, potentially fetching as much as $100 billion when it takes place in 2018. Prince Mohammed has pledged to invest much of the proceeds in economic diversification, boosting the country\u2019s technological and industrial sectors and reducing its reliance on oil revenue.Shares in Saudi Arabia\u2019s main stock market rose about 5.5% Wednesday after the news of Prince Mohammed\u2019s promotion. In particular, investors were cheered when index compiler             MSCI Inc.       said it had added Saudi Arabia to its watch list for possible classification as an emerging market as early as 2018\u2014a move prompted in part by Prince Mohammed\u2019s reform program.The prince\u2019s ascent comes at a time of economic strain caused by faltering oil prices, with crude falling into a bear market\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0and down again\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0morning.The value of the Aramco IPO will largely depend on oil prices, which were below $46 a barrel\u00a0for Brent crude on Wednesday\u201425% lower than the $60 the Saudis are privately targeting.\u201cWith the IPO at the center\u00a0stage, the kingdom needs higher [oil] prices,\u201d said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at\u00a0Energy Aspects.The prince\u2019s new power will give the country\u2019s energy minister,       Khalid al-Falih,        a freer hand, said       Robin Mills,       \u00a0head of Dubai-based consultancy Qamar Energy. Mr. Falih brokered an output-cutting pact with Russia, the world\u2019s largest oil producer, and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader.The deal knocks almost 2% off the world\u2019s oil output through to March 2018, in a bid to bring global supply back in line with demand.But prices haven\u2019t reacted the way the Saudis would have liked. U.S. producers ramped up output on the back of a price spike after 2016\u2019s Saudi-led production deal, flooding the world with a fresh wave of oil. There are also new petroleum supplies coming from Libya, an OPEC member exempted from the cut because civil strife crippled its energy industry until recently.Prince Mohammed\u2019s \u201creform agenda has been essential for Saudi Arabia to deal with\u00a0the low oil price issue. Whether it succeeds is another question, of\u00a0course,\u201d Mr. Mills said.The promotion of Prince Mohammed, who is known as MbS, provides clarity on the line of succession, but analysts say there are still barriers to the reform drive.\u201cMbS is likely to struggle to break through vested interests within the royal family, the business elite, the civil service and the religious establishment,\u201d       Jason Tuvey,        a Middle East economist at London-based Capital Economics, said.Some members of the Allegiance Council, which has the final say over succession in the Saudi royal family, voted against MbS\u2019s appointment as crown prince. This suggests some in the family aren\u2019t fully behind MbS, according to analysts.Underscoring the challenges ahead, the Saudi king retrospectively restored all the perks and benefits of state employees on Wednesday that were halted in 2016 as part of austerity measures to narrow the kingdom\u2019s budget deficit and then reinstalled in April.Write to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Nikhil Lohade at Nikhil.Lohade@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 11:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-aramcos-ipo-plans-strengthened-by-leadership-reshuffle-1498044893", "news_title": "Saudi Aramco\u2019s IPO Plans Strengthened by Royal Reshuffle ", "keywords": "opec cuts, opec deal, saudi aramco, saudi crown prince, saudi leadership, saudi royal family,Saudi Aramco,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,Mohammed bin Salman,corporate changes,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,energy,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "Home-improvement projects take off in the summer, when many homeowners gut the kitchen or add a bathroom. But what happens when a contractor\u2019s negligence causes those plans to go up in smoke\u2014literally?Doug Clark\u2019s 4,800-square-foot home in Baton Rouge, La., was hit by lightning in 2014, igniting a fire that destroyed the entire upstairs. During repairs, another storm came through and ripped off the roof, causing extensive flooding. Then, the contractor failed to properly secure the home, and new air-conditioning equipment was stolen, as well as jewelry, lawn equipment and two generators.The result: A $400,000 insurance claim, paid by Mr. Clark\u2019s insurance company, Privilege Underwriters Reciprocal Exchange, which specializes in high-value luxury and waterfront homes.\u201cWe made a classic mistake\u2014we hired a friend-of-a-friend, who was a contractor,\u201d says Mr. Clark, a corporate trainer. \u201cWe didn\u2019t give it a lot of thought. I had four children and two puppies, and we needed to be back in our house as quickly as we could.\u201dWhen a contractor\u2019s work harms a home, most homeowners seek damages under the contractor\u2019s liability policy. But with high-end homes, the situation is different.\u201cOften, a high-net-worth homeowner will file a claim with their homeowners-insurance carrier, versus directly with the contractor who caused the damage,\u201d says Lisa Lindsay, executive director of the Private Risk Management Association, a trade group that represents the high-net-worth insurance industry. \u201cTheir homeowners-insurance policy will likely provide a better claims experience and afford better insurance coverage.\u201dFor example, if a contractor has a $1 million policy but the renovation damage totaled $3 million, the homeowner would file a claim for the full amount with their own insurer. That insurer would likely subrogate, or seek reimbursement, from the contractor or its insurance company.For those about to embark upon a home-improvement project or other renovations, here are a few things to consider:\u2022 Verify everything. Fully vet your contractor. Make sure the firm holds a state license, is bonded (which ensures funds are available to pay the homeowner if the job isn\u2019t completed properly or items are stolen) and has required insurance, including general liability and workers\u2019 compensation. Remember that workers\u2019 compensation pays for medical care and lost wages if a worker sustains injuries on the job. If the contractor doesn\u2019t have proper insurance, those injured workers may sue you. Travelers suggests verifying the insurance coverage of subcontractors as well.\u2022 Keep copious records. Retain copies of all paperwork involved in your project\u2014proof of licensing, bonding and insurance, contracts, invoices, proof of payment, progress photos and all project-related correspondence.\u2022 Take inventory. Before starting a home-improvement project, make a detailed list of all the items in your home. Include furniture, appliances and personal possessions, and note the date you acquired each item and the purchase price. Consider taking photographs or making a video. If you do experience a property loss, your inventory will assist in the settlement of a covered loss or claim.Also, high-end homes are more likely to incorporate pricey materials or fixtures, not to mention valuable artwork or antiques, and a contractor\u2019s liability policy may not cover these items, Ms. Lindsay says.National annual remodeling expenditures are projected to reach almost $320 billion between April 2017 and March 2018, according to a quarterly report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. Yet even with so much work going on, the number of homeowners-insurance claims for damage done by contractors is relatively low. According to the Travelers Cos., which examined seven years of home-claim data, damage from home-improvement projects doesn\u2019t even rank in the top five causes of claims. That\u2019s because most claims would move forward under the contractor\u2019s policy.Claims from renovations frequently include water damage from pipe breaks, broken windows and fires. Theft of building materials is common as well.\u201cRenovations are a common source of mishaps,\u201d says Dan DiClerico, a home expert at HomeAdvisor, an online home-improvement marketplace in Golden, Colo. \u201cThere are so many things that can go wrong.\u201dExperts recommend that homeowners be in touch with their insurance agent before and after a home-improvement project. By checking in before, they can ensure they have sufficient coverage. The insurance company needs to know about the improvements completed as well. After a major renovation, the policy limits may need to be increased so that a homeowner has enough insurance to rebuild the home. Some projects, such as replacing a roof or installing impact-resistant windows, may quality for an insurance discount as well.", "news_time": "2017-06-21 11:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/are-you-sure-your-contractor-is-insured-1498057326", "news_title": "Are You Sure Your Contractor Is Insured?", "keywords": " contractors, home claims, home damage,home improvement, home renovations, insurance, insurance claims,luxury homes,Privilege Underwriters Reciprocal Exchange,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,legal action,disasters,accidents,floods,tidal waves,living,lifestyle,estates,natural disasters,catastrophes,real estate,property,risk news,burglary,theft,insurance,non-life insurance,casualty insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "TOKYO\u2014On their recent honeymoon in Japan, Jason and Nicole Francis savored the temples of the ancient capital of Kyoto and unwound at a resort with a private hot spring. Later they dressed up as a lime-green dinosaur and an Italian plumber and sped through the streets of Tokyo in go-karts.\u201cI picked Yoshi because I always pick Yoshi in the game,\u201d said Mr. Francis, a 35-year-old emergency-services worker in New Jersey, explaining his decision to don the dinosaur costume.The game is Mario Kart, a racing challenge from Japan\u2019s             Nintendo Co.      , introduced a quarter-century ago and now played on videogame consoles globally. A new business here takes advantage of Mario Kart\u2019s popularity and loose regulations on go-karts to offer self-driving tours of Tokyo and other cities, with costumes of characters from the game provided. The company, MariCar, says it books thousands of trips a month and most of the customers are non-Japanese.It\u2019s part of a tourism boom that is changing the face of the world\u2019s third-largest economy. Many businesses are selling a slice of what foreigners perceive as authentically Japanese. But while visitors are enjoying thrill rides in city streets, plucking off cherry-blossom branches for souvenirs and taking selfies in rented polyester kimonos, some locals are not amused.\u201cThey really are a nuisance,\u201d said Akio Arinaka, a Tokyo-based taxi driver in his 60s, of the costume-clad MariCar riders. \u201cWhen I see them driving close by it\u2019s scary, especially since they drive in large groups.\u201dOver 24 million foreign tourists visited Japan last year, nearly double the level two years earlier. The government has set a goal of attracting 40 million visitors a year\u2014almost one-third of the national population\u2014by the time Tokyo hosts the Summer Olympics in 2020.The influx raises an array of challenges for Japan, where English isn\u2019t widely spoken. The country\u2019s high-tech toilets, for instance, often mystify tourists who have trouble distinguishing between functions such as the bidet and seat warmer. Earlier this year, makers of the seats said they would standardize the icons to reduce mishaps.Most of the visitors are from elsewhere in Asia, with Chinese making up one of the biggest contingents. Locals recoil at videos of Asian tourists shaking cherry trees to create a snow-flurry effect from falling blossoms. Ahead of the flowering season last year, when many Japanese gather for picnics under cherry trees, the Chinese Embassy in Japan published an advisory on its website asking tourists not to climb the boughs or break off branches.In Kyoto, the kimono industry has mushroomed as new businesses have cropped up offering cheap, bright-colored versions of the garment for daily rental. Keiko Enomoto, who has worked in the industry for 30 years and runs a kimono store in Kyoto, is not impressed. She calls some of the newer rentals \u201cawful\u201d and \u201ctoo gaudy.\u201dMany visitors are drawn to the tech-infused side of Japanese popular culture, says Tim Oakes, Australia branch manager for travel company InsideJapan Tours. One of the company\u2019s most popular group tours is the 11-day \u201cHyperJapan J-Pop & Go!\u201d trip, fully booked in several of the coming months.The tour includes visits to a restaurant with a futuristic cabaret show of semi-erotic dancing robots and a museum for animation producer Studio Ghibli.Japan is synonymous with videogames for many younger visitors, including Natasha Adamo-Parker, a 29-year-old nurse and self-declared Mario Kart obsessive from Australia. She joined a recent MariCar ride and said the experience topped skydiving and bungee jumping.\u201cWhat is so surreal is that within the strict culture of Japan you get to do this wild thing,\u201d Ms. Adamo-Parker said.Groups of MariCar drivers have become a common sight in downtown Tokyo, zipping through the shopping district of Shibuya or across Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo Bay. U.S. military personnel based in Japan are among the customers. Videos of MariCar riders spotted in Tokyo have been posted online by visiting celebrities       Kim Kardashian       and Hugh Jackman. (Watch those videos here and here.)Rides are led by a guide and participants are asked not to race each other or throw banana peels or other items from the game onto the street.The red karts and colorful outfits stand out among the mostly white, gray and black cars on the orderly streets of Tokyo, ranked by the Economist Intelligence Unit think tank as the safest city in the world in part because of a low level of deadly traffic incidents.A spate of minor accidents, including one in which a go-kart driver hit a police station, has led to calls for tighter regulation by taxi drivers and other critics who have questioned the go-karts\u2019 safety. Drivers aren\u2019t required to wear seat belts or helmets, and the karts are treated similarly to mopeds under Japanese traffic laws.Customers must possess a valid local or international driving license. MariCar said in May it would cooperate with a police request to tighten safety procedures, including by banning the use of smartphones while driving. It declined to comment further. Kazuki Omura, manager of one of the Tokyo branches of MariCar, said customers are given a safety briefing and their driving skills are checked before they drive.Meanwhile, the company is battling a lawsuit by Nintendo accusing MariCar of copyright infringement. MariCar, which opened its first branch in Tokyo early last year, says it obtained an understanding from the videogame giant before launch. Nintendo declined to comment beyond its initial statement announcing the lawsuit, which called for a ban on the service and damages. The two sides made opening arguments in court in April.MariCar offers costumes of game characters including Yoshi the dinosaur. Many drivers pick the main character, a portly plumber named Mario who has become an iconic Japanese figure even though he is nominally Italian. During the closing ceremony for the Olympics in Brazil last year, Japanese Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe       appeared dressed as Mario.Executives from Universal Parks & Resorts, a unit of             Comcast Corp.\u2019s       NBCUniversal, wore big red Mario hats and white gloves at a June 8 groundbreaking event for a Nintendo area at their theme park in Osaka, Japan, scheduled to open in 2020.One of the main attractions: a Mario Kart ride.Write to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'Lost in Transmission: Tourists Driving Go-Karts Besiege Japan.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 11:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-wants-tourists-except-those-in-mario-costumes-driving-go-karts-1498057258", "news_title": "Japan Wants Tourists, Except Those in Mario Costumes Driving Go-Karts ", "keywords": "drive like mario,drive like yoshi in japan,japanese tourism,mario bros,mario kart tours,nintendo games in toyko,Nintendo,7974.TO,political,general news,living,lifestyle,travel,page-one stories,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,video game consoles,consumer goods,computing,durable household products,games software,home electronics,appliances,technology"}, {"content": "In an interview  published June 14 in the Journal Report on WSJ D.Live Asia,       Richard Liu       spoke about             JD.com Inc.\u2019s       record of success with customers during the past 12 years.

Mr. Haldane\u2019s comments, in a speech in the northern English city of Bradford, came a day after BOE Gov.       Mark Carney       laid out the case against raising the central bank\u2019s key interest rate.While members of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee are supposed to vote on their personal preference and not seek consensus or follow the governor\u2019s lead, there has been relatively little dissent during Mr. Carney\u2019s time at the helm.Those members who have voted to raise the key interest rate\u2014numbering three at the June meeting\u2014have been what are known as external members of the MPC, or people who don\u2019t work for the bank full-time and typically return to academia or their previous career after their three-year term has ended.None of the senior BOE officials who have sat on the committee since Mr. Carney took office in 2013 have cast a dissenting vote, but that is now the prospect offered by Mr. Haldane\u2019s change of heart.Outlining the reasons for that change, Mr. Haldane explained that he now sees the risk of raising rates too late as being greater than the risks of moving too early.The pound was last up 0.4% at $1.2681, from around $1.2650 just before Mr. Haldane\u2019s speech.\u201cThe risks of tightening \u201ctoo early\u201d have shrunk as growth and, to lesser extent, inflation have shown greater resilience than expected,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if policy tightened \u2018too late,\u2019 this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on.\u201dMr. Haldane suggested he had come close to joining the three dissenters earlier this month, having \u201cconsidered the case for a rate rise at the MPC\u2019s June meeting\u201d before deciding that a move later in the year would be more prudent.He noted that June\u2019s general election, which left Prime Minister       Theresa May       with the support of a minority of lawmakers and needing the backing of another party, had \u201cthrown up a dust-cloud of uncertainty.\u201d\u201cI do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust-cloud has started to settle,\u201d he said.In August 2016, the BOE cut its key interest rate to a record low of 0.25% and reactivated a dormant bond buying program in response to Britons\u2019 vote to leave the European Union.Mr. Haldane said policy makers should prepare to remove some of that stimulus, suggesting that for now he favors only a modest tightening in policy.\u201cA partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, I think such a tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations.\u201dIn a rescheduled speech to bankers at Mansion House in London, Mr. Carney said weak wage growth raised questions about the strength of domestic inflationary pressures, and he was unsure how the economy would respond to talks between the U.K. government and the rest of European Union on the terms of their separation.\u201cFrom my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment,\u201d he said.Mr. Haldane cited weak wage growth as a reason to wait until later in the year, and said growth could be slower than the BOE expected.\u201cBoth are reasons for monetary policy not to rush its fences,\u201d he said. \u201cNor does it need to do so, given the slow build of nominal pressures in the economy.\u201dThe pound\u2019s depreciation since the June 2016 vote to leave the EU has pushed up import prices, and the MPC expects inflation to be above its target over coming years.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 10:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boes-haldane-says-withdrawal-of-some-stimulus-needed-relatively-soon-1498043078", "news_title": "BOE\u2019s Haldane Raises Prospects for Rate Increase", "keywords": "boe, boe interest rates, uk interest rates,Bank of England,Andrew Haldane,economic performance,indicators,monetary policy,central bank intervention,interest rates,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Saudi King Salman promoted his son, Mohammed bin Salman, to crown prince, upending the line of succession for Saudi Arabia and putting a 31-year-old a heartbeat away from the throne during a turbulent period of war and change in the Middle East. Here\u2019s what you need to know about Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Known as MbS, Mohammed bin Salman wasn\u2019t a widely known figure before his father became king in 2015 and appointed him deputy crown prince and defense minister. He is the eldest son of King Salman\u2019s third wife, Fahdah bin Falah bin Sultan. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in law at King Saud University in Riyadh and worked for several government bodies before his first prominent national job in 2013, when he was named head of the Crown Prince\u2019s Court, with the rank of minister.In 2015, \u200bMohammed bin Salman took over two of the country\u2019s most sensitive portfolios\u2014the economy and defense\u2014before being elevated to deputy crown prince. His promotion passed over scores of older family members, including several prominent half-brothers. Since then he has become the face of the kingdom\u2019s ambitious economic overhauls and its war to oust Iranian proxies from Yemen. He speaks to Western media outlets, discussing Saudi Arabia\u2019s challenges with a degree of openness unseen before in the kingdom.People close to the Saudi royal court say King Salman sees Mohammed bin Salman as a national figure who represents the kingdom\u2019s restless younger generation. Mohammed bin Salman has long worked at his father\u2019s side, including as a special adviser when Salman was the governor of Riyadh. \u201cThe king trusts him with everything and he sees him as the only one that can truly transform this country. He is the definitely the gatekeeper for the king,\u201d a senior Saudi official said.Mohammed bin Salman has been the driving force behind an ambitious plan to diversify the economy of the world\u2019s largest oil exporter. The centerpiece of the program is the public listing of a small piece of Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-run oil company, known as Aramco. It could generate up to $100 billion, which the prince would direct into a new sovereign-wealth fund aimed at encouraging the development of technology and industrial sectors. \u201cBy 2020, we\u2019ll be able to live without oil,\u201d Prince Mohammed said after the plan\u2019s announcement in 2016.As minister of defense, Mohammed bin Salman has overseen Saudi Arabia\u2019s Yemen campaign, which began in March 2015 with the aim of countering the Houthi rebels and restoring the deposed president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, to power. He is also the architect of the Saudi backing of rebels opposed to Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad.       Mohammed bin Salman was among the first foreign leaders to visit President       Donald Trump,        forging a warmer relationship with the U.S. after years of tension.Write to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Michael Amon at michael.amon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 10:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-saudi-arabias-new-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-1498053836", "news_title": "Meet Saudi Arabia\u2019s New Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman ", "keywords": " aramco, crown prince, energy,king salman, mbs, mohammed bin salman, oil , saudi arabia,King Saud University,political,general news,royal families"}, {"content": "Etsy Inc.

When he has taken the podium at the briefings, which are held most weekdays, he has adopted a less combative approach and shown an increasing willingness to leave reporters\u2019 questions unanswered.Amid speculation about how long he will remain the main face of the briefings, Mr. Spicer has also been more likely to say he hasn\u2019t talked to Mr. Trump about major policy issues.On Tuesday, Mr. Spicer\u2019s first on-camera briefing in more than a week, he was asked if the president believes Russia interfered with the 2016 election.\u201cI have not sat down and talked to him about that specific thing,\u201d Mr. Spicer said.Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies say the Russians did interfere, but Mr. Trump has been reluctant to embrace their assessment. Russia has denied any meddling.Mr. Spicer also said Tuesday he didn\u2019t know whether the president has seen the Senate health-care bill, which his fellow Republicans have said will be voted on next week. The same inquiry was made of Mr. Spicer on Monday\u00a0during an off-camera media briefing. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d he replied then.Mr. Spicer\u2019s lower-key approach follows a tumultuous period for the communications team after the firing of       James Comey       as Federal Bureau of Investigation director, when Mr. Trump made several statements that contradicted those of his aides and fueled speculation about Mr. Spicer\u2019s job status.Recently, internal discussions have centered on whether Mr. Spicer should transition to a more strategic, behind-the-scenes role if the president could find a replacement for him, either internally or externally, to handle the briefings, a senior White House official said.Asked about his job status\u00a0on Tuesday, Mr. Spicer smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for ways to do a better job of articulating the president\u2019s message and his agenda and we\u2019ll continue to have those discussions internally,\u201d he said.For now, Mr. Spicer\u2014a former communications director for the Republican National Committee who was outside of Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit until last year\u2014has avoided wading into hot-button issues.Mr. Spicer said Tuesday\u00a0he didn\u2019t know whether the president recorded conversations with Mr. Comey, a question reporters have asked him repeatedly since  Mr. Trump suggested the possibility in a tweet last month.A personal lawyer for Mr. Trump said\u00a0Sunday\u00a0that the tapes issue could be addressed this week.Mr. Spicer also sidestepped a question on whether Mr. Trump believes the Obama administration is partly responsible for the death of       Otto Warmbier,        an American student held by North Korea. Mr. Trump said earlier in the day that if Mr. Warmbier\u00a0had been returned to the U.S. sooner, \u201cI think the result would have been a lot different.\u201dIn three of his past seven media briefings, Mr. Spicer was asked whether the president still believes climate change is a hoax, as he stated various times before becoming president. Asked again\u00a0on Monday\u00a0if he had spoken to the president about it, Mr. Spicer said, \u201cI have not.\u201dThe press team is under round-the-clock scrutiny from the president, who devours cable news inside the White House. He has been known to stop meetings to turn on the daily press briefing, which cable networks continue to air from start to finish five months into the president\u2019s term.Mr. Trump has privately complained about his communications team from the very start of his administration. His criticisms have spanned from what he saw as Mr. Spicer\u2019s uneven and inaccurate defense of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration crowds, to his unhappiness with what he viewed as a weak defense of his decision to fire Mr. Comey, according to senior White House officials.Mr. Trump moved into the White House without a communications director, and is again without one.       Mike Dubke,        who was hired for the position about a month into the new administration, resigned last month. He described his decision to leave as a personal one, but he also struggled to gel with the new president and found himself a frequent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s frustrations, said people familiar with the matter.In the meantime, Mr. Spicer has made fewer trips to the podium than he did in the early months of the administration. In the past three weeks, other press staffers have filled in to deliver a total of six briefings. Of Mr. Spicer\u2019s seven briefings, he has prohibited video and audio broadcasts of two.Will Mr. Spicer continue to handle the briefings? Consider that one of the unanswered questions.\u201cWhen we have an announcement of a personnel nature,\u201d he said\u00a0Tuesday, \u201cwe\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-06-21 10:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sean-spicer-shifts-to-lower-key-approach-as-white-house-spokesman-1498054239", "news_title": "Sean Spicer Shifts to Lower-Key Approach as White House Spokesman ", "keywords": "press secretary,sean spicer,spicer,trump,trump administration,white house,white house spokesman,Sean Spicer,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "The Golden State Warriors are technically beatable. Nothing in the NBA rulebook stipulates that beating them is illegal. They will be toppled at some point. If not next year, then the year after that. Or the year after that. The Warriors won\u2019t be champions for the next five seasons. We think.But the question at the heart of this off-season is how to stop the Warriors from becoming a dynasty. It\u2019s already making the rest of the league slightly insane.There are some teams that don\u2019t have the luxury of waiting for answers. They\u2019re built to win now. Which is why they find themselves scrambling this summer to do something\u2014anything\u2014that gives them a better chance to beat the Warriors. That\u2019s what makes this off-season unlike any other: The league\u2019s best teams are the ones forced to make the boldest moves.The total chaos of the next month will highlight the fact that the most intriguing NBA action is no longer confined to games. The off-season has become as dramatic as the actual season.The draft is Thursday night, followed soon afterward by free agency, but the annual craziness is already underway. There will soon be more cryptic emojis. There will be ludicrous tweets that are later proven true. There will be rumors about wild deals that didn\u2019t happen and confirmations of wilder deals that did. There will even be a brief time when it appears the New York Knicks are trading Kristaps Porzingis for a half-eaten turnip.But all that will matter when the regular season begins is whether any of the teams built to win now have made themselves any more likely to upset the Warriors.The dominance of one team is having an effect on the entire league. Less than a week after the Warriors beat the Cleveland Cavaliers for the NBA title, for example, the Cavs were already thinking about trading one of their stars for another star who might give them a better look against Golden State next year.The Cavs have a problem\u2014they can\u2019t play the same lineup against the Warriors and pray for a different result\u2014and Paul George could be their solution. George becomes a free agent next summer, but he\u2019s being shopped as a one-year rental after he informed the Pacers he plans to leave Indiana and wants to eventually wind up with the Lakers, according to Yahoo\u2019s The Vertical.A trade for George that likely costs Kevin Love would be a gamble for the Cavs, and the executive rolling the dice would be someone who\u2019s never done it before. Cavs general manager David Griffin was sniffing around potential deals until early this week\u2014and then he found out his own contract wasn\u2019t being renewed. It\u2019s now the job of Griffin\u2019s unknown replacement to challenge the Warriors before some guy named LeBron James becomes a free agent next summer. So the only thing at stake is the future of the entire franchise.But the Cavs aren\u2019t the only team making plans that revolve around the Warriors. Every contender has no choice but to chase stars this summer. None of them are even marginal improvements away from a championship.That\u2019s why the Houston Rockets represent another potential destination for George, Chicago Bulls forward Jimmy Butler and marquee free agents. That\u2019s also why the most fascinating move of the off-season would be the San Antonio Spurs pairing Kawhi Leonard with Clippers point guard Chris Paul. The Rockets and Spurs are two of the NBA\u2019s best teams, and the NBA\u2019s best teams usually don\u2019t have any incentive to take big risks. The Warriors are now their incentive.The Boston Celtics, meanwhile, can win now and several years from now. They have the flexibility to sign a star, draft a potential star or package some of their draft picks to trade for a star. They\u2019ve already made a big gamble by trading the No. 1 overall pick, likely to be Washington guard Markelle Fultz, for the No. 3 pick and another high pick in the next two years. What else they chose to do this summer will determine whether the Celtics threaten the Warriors sooner or later.\u201cWe are certainly aware of our competition,\u201d said Boston president of basketball operations Danny Ainge. \u201cWe watched the same Finals that everyone did.\u201dThe way to beat the Warriors eventually, though, may be not trying to beat the Warriors now.Their greatest competition might come from nowhere. Look at what happened five years ago. LeBron James had just won his first championship with the Miami Heat. The Oklahoma City Thunder were a dynasty in the making with Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden. The Los Angeles Lakers were supposed to dominate the sport for years after trading for Dwight Howard and Steve Nash. The summer of 2012 now seems like ancient times. James left Miami for Cleveland, the Thunder never made it back to the Finals, and the Lakers still haven\u2019t won a playoff game.The Warriors were irrelevant then. Their most important pick of the 2012 draft came in the second round, and their most important transaction in that off-season was extending the contract of a player already on their team.But the best moves in today\u2019s NBA only become clear in retrospect. What the Warriors quietly accomplished that summer was an example of what other teams might achieve this summer. Golden State wasn\u2019t planning to beat a specific team when they drafted Draymond Green and extended Stephen Curry. Those were still the decisions that helped make them the team to beat.Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 10:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-warriors-are-behind-the-nbas-chaotic-summer-1498053929", "news_title": "Why the Warriors Are Behind the NBA\u2019s Chaotic Summer", "keywords": "basketball,boston celtics,cleveland cavaliers,golden state warriors,markelle fultz,nba,nba draft,nba trade,paul george,Golden State Warriors,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "\u2022 President of Cirrus Wealth Management in Cleveland  \u2022 Education: B.A. Dennison University, J.D. Duquesne University  \u2022 Chartered Financial Consultant and Chartered Life UnderwriterBackground: Mr. Heider got his start at a Philadelphia-based financial-planning firm that specialized in work with attorneys and physicians. Given the tax and estate-planning challenges these groups often face in that work, Mr. Heider was inspired to go back to school to pursue a law degree. Though he never practiced as a lawyer, the experience gave him an appreciation of the expertise that specialists like certified public accountants and attorneys can bring to the planning process. Before founding Cirrus Wealth Management, Mr. Heider was managing partner with Rehmann Financial and president and co-founder of Dawson Wealth Management in Cleveland.His practice: Cirrus Wealth Management works with medical practitioners and the owners of small businesses with between 25 and 100 employees. The firm\u2019s 200 clients hold $400 million in assets. Mr. Heider provides direction and guidance to his associates and team, who, in turn, work closely with clients to implement his direction. \u201cPlanning should be a collaborative process,\u201d he says. \u201cAdvisers should feel empowered, not threatened, by the experience of those around them and utilize it to best serve the needs of their clients.\u201dOn a planning challenge facing many business owners: Finding an internal successor can be a huge challenge for business owners, Mr. Heider says. The process typically involves a transfer of ownership to the next generation, so there\u2019s potential for conflict between family members who believe they\u2019re entitled to a share of the business. \u201cHelping manage those egos and relationships is one of your most important roles as an adviser,\u201d he says.On successful succession strategies: Mr. Heider recommends that advisers meet with business owners and their children well in advance of a succession to establish a plan that details every piece of that process. The plan should include the equity in the company the child will receive, their starting salary, and how their success at the company will be determined, he says. He also notes that it\u2019s useful for children to spend time working for another company outside of the family business to gain relevant skills, fresh ideas, and valuable perspective that they can apply to their work with the company they will inherit.The greatest challenge facing the advising industry today: Mr. Heider is concerned about the increasing average age of the adviser population. \u201cAdvisers who want to grow and provide internal continuity for their business and clients when they retire need to consider bringing on a younger adviser, now,\u201d he says.His proudest personal achievement: \u201cOutside of my children, it\u2019s the work I\u2019ve done as a member of the Cystic Fibrosis National Leadership Council and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a charity I\u2019ve been involved with for 15 years,\u201d he says.When not at the office you might find him\u2026 Up in the air. Mr. Heider grew up loving planes and has been an avid pilot since his 20s.

The key votes came from his own Social Democratic Party, which has become so frustrated with his leadership that it expelled him from its member list last week.Within days, Parliament is expected to form Romania\u2019s fourth government in two years.Corruption protests have become a recurrent threat to Romanian governments. Mr. Grindeanu\u2019s fall from power began in February with Romania\u2019s largest demonstrations since the fall of communism. More than 250,000 protesters marched through snow-packed streets against a ruling party ordinance that would have restricted prosecutors from investigating public officeholders for corruption.That ordinance was crucial to the leader of Mr. Grindeanu\u2019s party,       Liviu Dragnea,        who is under indictment for abuse of office. Mr. Dragnea says he is innocent, and his party argues that increasingly exhaustive corruption investigations\u2014partly funded by the European Union\u2014have made governing Romania too difficult.Still, days of protests pushed Mr. Grindeanu to withdraw the ordinance. That move freed prosecutors to keep pursuing corruption cases against the ruling party. But it also sparked a fierce rivalry with Mr. Dragnea, who first nominated the then-obscure Mr. Grindeanu as prime minister in December, telling reporters, \u201cI wanted a man I could trust.\u201dSince then, bribery, abuse of office, and favoritism cases have piled up against Romanian political leaders and Mr. Dragnea has grown critical of Mr. Grindeanu. The friction between the two has proven untenable, and all but three of Romania\u2019s 27 ministers resigned before Wednesday\u2019s vote.\u201cIt\u2019s a rivalry, a rivalry that wasn\u2019t supposed to be a rivalry,\u201d said       Jacques Tohme,        managing director of energy firm Amerocap LLC and a longtime investor in Romania. \u201cGrindeanu, he was expected to be a good, loyal guy they can rely on, and he was more independent than perhaps once thought.\u201dRomania\u2014the fastest-growing economy in Central and Eastern Europe over the past five years\u2014is in a protracted political deadlock over how seriously to tackle corruption.Since November 2015, anticorruption protests have flared regularly in the capital. Each of the past three governments were ushered into\u2014or out of\u2014power by such a protest.The ruling party, which lost power in 2015 and regained it last year, has tried to refocus public attention on to popular benefit programs. Starting next year, Mr. Dragnea\u2019s party hopes to raise public wages by 25%, a $2 billion expenditure that would reward his political base of aging rural voters.But that program has been delayed as protesters\u2014primarily in urban centers, home to some of Europe\u2019s fastest-growing wages\u2014push for a crackdown against corruption. Many have been enticed home from Western Europe by rising wages, and a chance to reform an ex-communist dictatorship into something closer to the standard of governance they feel they experienced abroad.\u201cMore and more people look at Europe, look at the U.S., and understand it\u2019s not like the 90s, when your entire dream was \u2018how do I get out of here,\u2019\u201d said       Laura Stefan,        a former director in the Romanian Ministry of Justice. \u201cNow, Romania is a country worth fighting for.\u201dWrite to Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'Romania Prime Minister Ousted.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 09:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/romania-removes-prime-minister-after-monthslong-turbulence-1498053546", "news_title": "Romania Removes Prime Minister After Monthslong Turbulence", "keywords": "romania,Sorin Grindeanu,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Property tycoon Wang Shi\u2019s step-down from the helm of             China Vanke        000002 0.76%       marks the end of an era for one of the crown jewels of China\u2019s private business world.Mr. Wang said Wednesday that he wouldn\u2019t seek a board position this year, a decision that came soon after he wrested back control of the company from an unwanted takeover attempt that ended up giving a state-owned firm a dominant position in the company.\u201cI have decided not to be nominated a candidate,\u201d the 66-year-old Mr. Wang said on mobile-messaging app             WeChat.       \u201cToday, I passed the baton to the leadership team led by Yu Liang,\u201d Vanke\u2019s president. \u201cI believe this is the best timing,\u201d Mr. Wang wrote. \u201cThey are much younger, but fully mature.\u201dOver the past three decades as Vanke chairman, Mr. Wang built a reputation as an independent businessman adept at navigating a tricky relationship with the Communist Party.Yet, Mr. Wang recognized the advantage of having the state on his side. He used his political ties to a subway operator backed by the government of the southern tech hub of Shenzhen as the key to rescue Vanke from a hostile bid by financial conglomerate Baoneng Group. His departure from Vanke\u2019s board comes after he had put Vanke safely in the hands of handpicked ally Shenzhen Metro Group.Even before that, Mr. Wang had dialed back his involvement in the company, pursuing a busy agenda of hobbies. An avid mountaineer, he has climbed Mount Everest twice. In recent years, he took classes at Harvard and Cambridge.It is unclear whether Mr. Wang will continue to have a role at Vanke. \u201cHe basically totally retired, or quit, from China Vanke,\u201d said Raymond Cheng, an analyst at CIMB Research about Mr. Wang\u2019s Wednesday announcement.A Vanke spokeswoman referred to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing that didn\u2019t include Mr. Wang on a list of board candidates. She declined to comment further. Mr. Wang didn\u2019t respond to calls to his cellphone or emails requesting comment.Under Mr. Wang\u2019s leadership, Vanke rose to the top of China\u2019s property boom in the late 1990s selling high-end apartments and became one of the country\u2019s biggest home builders by sales in the process. Mr. Wang took almost no shares in his company, an unusual move among Chinese tycoons who tend to retain close ownership of their firm. City officials sought out Mr. Wang to do business on his terms, noted a 2014 Harvard Business Review article on Chinese management thinking.But the protracted takeover battle for Vanke showed how quickly the company shifted from a vibrant private firm to one under significant state control. A government entity in Shenzhen that oversees state-owned companies said in March that Vanke was now under its purview, according to a Reuters report, which quoted Vanke as saying it remained a \u201cmixed-ownership enterprise.\u201dAlready in 2000, Mr. Wang brought in state-owned             China Resources                   Group. Mr. Wang later depicted the move as an attempt to assuage any Chinese leadership worries about letting a private developer get too big without any state involvement.\u201cYou can call it opportunism. You can also call it wisdom,\u201d he told a room of internet entrepreneurs in a 2014 speech.Officials in China\u2019s state-directed economy control access to land, credit and regulatory enforcement.But ties fell apart last year. China Resources objected to Mr. Wang\u2019s proposed asset-swap deal that would have diluted Baoneng Group\u2019s interest, because its own stake would have been diminished too.Instead Shenzhen Metro, which took a stake in Vanke in 2016, bought out the stakes of China Resources and rival developer China Evergrande in recent months.Over the same period, China\u2019s insurance regulator stepped up scrutiny of aggressive investments by Evergrande and Baoneng, which effectively prevented the two companies from further increasing their Vanke shareholdings.The subway operator is now Vanke\u2019s largest investor with a 29% stake. Baoneng remains the second largest.Shenzhen Metro\u2019s role in Vanke is the strongest a government has ever had in the company. The developer can build real-estate projects on top of subway stations in Shenzhen.\u2014Pei Li contributed to this article.Write to Dominique Fong at Dominique.Fong@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 09:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-vanke-founder-wang-shi-to-step-down-from-board-1498018303", "news_title": "China Vanke Founder Wang Shi to Step Down From Board", "keywords": " china, china vanke, homebuilding, vanke,wang shi,China Vanke ,000002.SZ,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,management,management moves,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,building construction,construction,real estate"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014      Cristiano Ronaldo,        one of the world\u2019s best-paid soccer stars, faces a tax investigation by Spanish authorities. Now the type of tax planning Madrid says he used is in the crosshairs of the European Union.Spanish authorities allege the 32-year-old Real Madrid player withheld taxes worth \u20ac14.8 million ($16.5 million) by funneling earnings from his image rights through the British Virgin Islands, a low tax jurisdiction outside of the EU. This technique, while legal, would be flagged under rules proposed by the EU\u2019s executive arm and reported to the Spanish tax authorities.Mr. Ronaldo\u2019s press representative said in a statement on June 13 that the soccer player didn\u2019t try to evade taxes and that no income was hidden at all.The commission proposed rules Wednesday that would force lawyers, consultants, tax advisers, and banks\u2014so-called intermediaries\u2014to disclose plans to national tax authorities that help multinationals and wealthy individuals dodge taxes.\u201cWe are looking at the roots of the aggressive tax planning chain by imposing new rules for all those who contribute to it\u2014lawyers, consultants, banks, agents\u2014sometimes in a lawful manner, sometimes illegally,\u201d said EU tax chief       Pierre Moscovici       on Wednesday.The move is the latest piece of the EU\u2019s broader clampdown on tax avoidance after the Panama Papers revealed tax planning techniques that helped clients exploit loopholes and arbitrage tax regimes in different countries to cut bills. A total of \u20ac173 billion ($192.8 billion) of tax was avoided through the Panama Papers schemes alone, according to an April study by the EU Parliament.The proposed rules set out a list of characteristics that determine whether or not a tax plan could result in losses for governments. If so, the intermediary has to report the plan.Such features include using losses to reduce tax liabilities, converting income into other types of revenue taxed at lower levels, or using special beneficial tax regimes.If a tax adviser is outside the EU, and therefore not under the EU rules, the burden is on the multinational or individual receiving the advice to report the plan to national tax authorities.The rules to crack down on intermediaries who plan tax optimization are intended to give tax authorities the information they need to thwart aggressive tax planning, Mr. Moscovici said. National authorities will be obliged to exchange information on a quarterly basis through a centralized database.People familiar with the commission\u2019s plans said some tax authorities may be so astonished by the loopholes exposed that they could decide to change the law. The European Parliament recently estimated in a study that tax avoidance cost EU public budgets between \u20ac50 billion to \u20ac70 billion a year.Under the proposed rules, intermediaries that advised Mr. Ronaldo would have been obliged to report the tax plan to national authorities within five days of presenting him with the plan. If the adviser was bound by confidentiality rules, Mr. Ronaldo would be responsible for directly disclosing the plan.The U.K., Portugal, and Ireland already have national rules in place that require tax intermediaries to report tax optimization plans.The U.S. has a double reporting system in place\u2014taxpayers and intermediaries have to report plans. The commission looked into this but thought a double reporting system would be too burdensome, according to people familiar with discussions.National governments could impose sanctions and penalties on those who don\u2019t comply. The sanctions are to be determined by member states.\u201cThe commission has stepped up a gear in the fight against tax dumping in the EU,\u201d said       Sven Giegold,        a German member of the European Parliament. \u201cThe Parliament has heard time and again through the Panama Papers inquiry that the self-supervision of these intermediaries is insufficient.\u201dThe new reporting requirements for intermediaries, if approved by member states, would come into force by Jan. 1, 2019.Write to Julia-Ambra Verlaine at julia.verlaine@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 09:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-proposes-tighter-rules-on-tax-planning-1498052110", "news_title": "EU Proposes Tighter Rules on Tax Planning", "keywords": "european commission,european union,eu rules,tax avoidance,tax planning,European Union,Cristiano Ronaldo,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news"}, {"content": "As investors struggle to understand the overhaul of the Affordable Care Act, one area to watch is insurance deductibles, which are likely to rise and could increase pressure on the health-care industry to control costs.Senate Republicans are set to unveil their proposed legislation later this week, with a possible vote before July 4.\u00a0Investors will handicap the bill\u2019s chances of becoming law and compare the impact on the industry from the Senate versus the House plan.Other big things to watch are proposed reductions in Medicaid spending, provisions to allow states to opt out of coverage requirements by insurers and the impact of the bill on insurance premiums.

Subscribe to the podcast.Investors shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the bill\u2019s impact on expected out-of-pocket expenses for patients, however. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service estimated that the House bill would increase total out-of-pocket spending by $221 billion more than the current law over 10 years.Those increased out-of-pocket costs will make Americans more aware of how much they pay for health care. That could be especially pronounced for consumers buying individual plans on public exchanges. A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis from March found that the American Health Care Act could raise the typical annual deductible for an individual plan to $4,100 from $2,550 under Obamacare.Deductibles have risen already.\u00a0More than 40% of commercially insured patients had a health plan with a family deductible above $2,600 in 2016, either from their employer or through a plan sold on an insurance exchange, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is up from about 29% in 2011.That helped cause the backlash against Mylan\u2019s EpiPen after the out-of-pocket cost doubled between 2007 and 2014, according to a recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association.The Trump administration would like to lower insurance premiums while minimizing the number of Americans who might lose access to insurance.\u00a0Higher deductibles would seem to be a logical outcome from those policy goals. Bigger out-of-pocket costs could make it harder for drug companies to raise prices or introduce expensive new products, both of which would hurt profits.Health-care stocks have performed admirably this year, despite uncertainty over future health policy and continued focus on high drug prices.

Now a wide range of companies\u2014including plane maker         Airbus SE,       ride-sharing specialists Uber Technologies Inc., and a startup backed by             Intel Corp.      \u2014are racing to turn the concept into reality.Different ideas for flying cars have been tried for years, but the current designs are less about cars with wings and more about small vehicles that take off and land vertically for short commutes by air. The varied configurations are generally more compact and smaller than helicopters. The new designs lack the distinctive protruding large bladed rotors that make helicopter operations a challenge in tight urban settings.Some designs are already flying in testing areas; others are set to take to the air in the next few years. If the technologists have their way, the vehicles will start zipping amid skyscrapers early next decade.Still, there\u2019s ample reason to doubt such a timetable. Many underlying technologies for these concept vehicles remain unproven, and regulators haven\u2019t decided how such air traffic would be managed.\u201cThe market has real potential\u201d if barriers can be overcome, says James McMicking, chief strategy officer at Britain\u2019s Aerospace Technology Institute. \u201cThe manufacturers of these things can probably put them together relatively easily, but then to demonstrate they can work in the airspace above cities is going to be really hard to do.\u201dAirbus, the European aerospace giant best known for the A320 short-haul airliner and A380 superjumbo, has made solving the airborne urban-mobility problem one of the first major tests for its new technology accelerator, A3. That organization, set up in Silicon Valley in 2015, is supposed to help the company break with its history of spending many years and billions of dollars to develop new systems.Rodin Lyasoff, A3\u2019s chief executive, says a number of developments in energy storage, electric motors, public acceptance and regulatory environment are converging to make intra-urban flying\u2014even without pilots\u2014possible. \u201cThis is a completely new time for this type of aircraft,\u201d he says.A3\u2019s first prototype, the Vahana\u2014a fully automated, pilotless vehicle\u2014could take to the sky before year-end, at which point testing is expected to last at least several months. The prototype has four propellers on each of two wings that can rotate to a vertical position for takeoff and landing, like a helicopter, and to a horizontal position for level flight. The propellers are driven by electric motors, says project manager Zach Lovering.The initial Vahana can carry one person weighing as much as 220 pounds a range of about 31 miles. Improvements in battery and other technologies should double the range, the company says. Airbus is still assessing whether to build a one- or two-person vehicle. It may attempt to win regulatory approval to put its system into service around 2021.Assuming the vehicles do become operational, the plan is for Airbus or another company to use the aircraft to create an airborne ride-hailing service. (Airbus is experimenting with on-demand, piloted helicopter services as well.) Passengers would be charged a rate of $250 an hour, similar to what they pay a taxi on the road, but arrive at their destinations much faster. Getting from San Francisco to San Jose, for example, would cost the same $80 to $100 as a taxi charges but take a fraction of the time.Mr. Lyasoff says there are some air-traffic-management issues to work through. The plan, he says, is for the vehicles to fly at an altitude of around 1,000 feet, staying out of the way of big commercial jets but leaving enough airspace below for drone-delivery systems to operate.A rival concept is on the drawing board at Uber. The ride-sharing giant is preparing to test its flying car near both Dallas and Dubai within three years, though it has provided few details on its business plan. Uber says it is working with companies such as Brazilian plane maker         Embraer SA       and             Textron Inc.Intel\u2019s venture-capital arm, meanwhile, has thrown an unspecified amount of financing behind the Volocopter, under development by E-Volo GmbH in Germany. It would sport multiple, shrouded rotors intended to be easy to pilot\u2014or fly autonomously\u2014in a flying-taxi configuration. The aim is to have a model in trials next year under a German light-aircraft license. A four-seat design that would seek approval from European and U.S. regulators is on the drawing board.One of the big questions about battery-powered flying taxis has been how to refuel them when landing-pad space may be limited. The Volocopter will feature a system that will allow its battery to be swapped out in a few minutes, so the vehicles can get out of each other\u2019s way quickly.Another German newcomer is Lilium Aviation, which flew a two-seat prototype in April. The company expects a five-seat version\u2014a pilot and four passengers\u2014to take to the air in 2019, and hopes to offer on-demand air transport starting around 2025. Its electric engines are embedded in its wings to allow it to operate in tight spaces.While many newcomers bet on electric propulsion, Israel\u2019s Urban Aeronautics Ltd., a more established firm, is working on a small, emergency-response helicopter with a more traditional design. Its prototype, the Cormorant, which began flying late last year, uses a common, industry-approved helicopter engine, which powers smaller shrouded fans. The Israeli designers picked the concept specifically to fly into locations too confined for helicopters.\u201cWe started working on this long before everyone got into urban mobility,\u201d says Janina Frankel-Yoeli, vice president for marketing. The primary design focus has been to build something that could be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, she says, rather than to bet on technologies that have yet to undergo regulatory scrutiny.In April, however, not to be left behind in the more experimental space of futuristic flying vehicles, an Urban Aeronautics subsidiary said it would start work on a four-passenger, hydrogen-powered, vertical-takeoff-and-landing car that it calls the CityHawk. Where most cars now have their engine and trunk, the CityHawk will feature large fans driven by a helicopter engine to keep the piloted craft aloft. The company hasn\u2019t indicated a deadline for when it hopes to have the aircraft ready for market.While more manufacturers continue to work on these and other plans, Mr. McMicking of the Aerospace Technology Institute urges patience. \u201cIt is difficult,\u201d he says, \u201cto imagine anything happening in the next decade or so.\u201dMr. Wall is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in London.

Groups provide a community environment for students, with weekly meetings and social events similar to campus clubs, but members have article quotas\u2014typically one a week\u2014and work to increase the page views and engagement that help their for-profit parent companies succeed.The companies, which don\u2019t disclose financial information, have attracted millions of dollars in funding for their ability to cheaply generate large amounts of content and traffic. Spoon, until recently backed by venture capital, was purchased in May for an undisclosed amount by             Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.,                   the owner of HGTV and part owner of Cooking Channel and Food Network.As more traditional media companies move to ramp up digital revenue and cover costs as print advertising declines, these student-based sites have a lower-cost model to produce articles and make revenue from advertising and sponsored posts. The startups run franchise-like microsites, with local chapters led, written and edited by students and overseen by a small group of paid employees. Spoon has 200 chapters, Her Campus has 340 and Odyssey has 1,200.Ms. Dearinger, who juggled her work at Spoon with a restaurant job and journalism classes, says the unpaid experience was more relevant than the student newspaper for becoming a professional food writer.Academics, labor lawyers and activists have criticized unpaid internships, saying they aren\u2019t financially doable for students from poorer backgrounds. Some major companies have ended their unpaid internship programs and struck million-dollar settlements with groups of interns who alleged they were doing the work of employees and therefore should be paid like it.Juno Turner,        a partner at Outten & Golden LLP who has reached unpaid-interns settlements with media companies, said a business model built on unpaid work \u201cseems like a pretty flagrant violation of the law.\u201dThe chapter-based media companies said they legally vetted their business models and their writers aren\u2019t interns, contractors or employees, but more akin to users who choose to participate on social-media platforms.Writers at these sites\u2014who call themselves everything from contributors to editorial staff to chapter correspondents\u2014say they appreciate the community and the broader reach they provide compared with student publications.Having content on a well-known site \u201ccan be invaluable for the journalists,\u201d said       Lynn Walsh,        president of the Society of Professional Journalists. \u201cBut at the same time, the company is benefiting from that. We would hope that monetary value is passed along to the people doing the work.\u201dOdyssey Executive Chairman       Evan Burns       said 25 full-time, paid editors help improve the quality of articles contributed to his company\u2019s site by more than 14,000 writers.\u201cWe are investing money and people and resource into you, a regular person, to help you craft that content, and we\u2019re helping put that in front of interested consumers,\u201d said Mr. Burns.Michael Lazerow,        an investor and Odyssey board member who co-led a $25 million funding round last year, said chapter-based sites offer a solution to the high costs of a typical media company while also benefiting contributors.\u201cOdyssey was helping them become a better writer\u201d and offering them distribution, Mr. Lazerow said.Stephanie Kaplan Lewis,        CEO of Her Campus, said her company offers members professional-development resources and exclusive internships.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely in the business of making money, but at the same time a lot of what we do is quite nonprofit-y,\u201d Ms. Kaplan Lewis said. \u201cThese women are really reaping the rewards in terms of the jobs and internships that they go on to get. It has to be that way, otherwise no one would want to participate.\u201dThe chapter-based media approach hasn\u2019t gone smoothly for everyone. The Rival, a 17-chapter humor, satire and opinion site that was launched in 2014, remains unprofitable, despite free content from students, because of expensive technology and the declining price of online display ads. Co-founder       Josh Strupp       recently took a full-time job as a marketing coordinator at an advertising agency to pay his own expenses.Mr. Strupp said writers love working for the Rival. Still, in hindsight, he wishes he had gone the nonprofit route.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to utilize free labor of any kind to profit,\u201d he said.As for Ms. Dearinger, she is currently an unpaid intern at a professional food magazine in Indiana, looking for full-time, paid work.Corrections & Amplifications   Evan Burns is the executive chairman of Odyssey Media Group Inc. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said he is chief executive, a position he left in May. Also, the company has 25 full-time paid editors.

Regret has stalked similar decisions in the past, but the timing looks better this time.U.K. insurer Aviva is in the process of selling the roughly $1.4 billion of tobacco stocks and bonds it holds. It joins a growing throng of money managers. Fifty-three investors, health systems, pension funds and insurers, representing in total $3.8 trillion in assets under management, last month signed a statement flagging the economic costs of smoking and supporting stronger regulation.The longest-standing tobacco critic may be the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, which sold out in 2000. From an investment point of view, the move proved very badly timed. A 2015 analysis for the CalPERS investment committee suggested that it had forgone $3 billion in investment returns.

As hedge-fund manager Cliff Asness pointed out last month, the decision is pointless unless it reduces the tobacco industry\u2019s market value and hence makes its investment plans more expensive; virtue must be its own reward.But it helps if ethics and investment strategy point in the same direction.

Uber may be great at technology, but unlike the businesses of Google,             Facebook,       Apple or Amazon, technology hasn\u2019t proven to be a significant barrier to new entrants in ride-sharing. Across the globe, Uber has dozens of competitors, and in many markets they have grabbed the lion\u2019s share of the ride-sharing market.Even if Uber fixes all of its current problems, it\u2019s increasingly unlikely that it can live up to the inflated expectations that come with the nearly $70 billion valuation that have made it the world\u2019s most valuable startup. There are barbarians at Uber\u2019s gate, and it\u2019s sorely in need of a moat.Mr. Kalanick, who initially announced a leave of absence last week, wrote then that the company must evolve into \u201cUber 2.0\u201d, acknowledging it needs a complete overhaul of its corporate culture. But it\u2019s not clear how Uber the caterpillar becomes Uber the butterfly.\u201cWe think the company\u2019s back is to the wall, and there is no more room for continued screwups,\u201d early Uber investor       Mitch Kapor       said last week. Mr. Kapor, who in February co-wrote an open letter to Uber about the company\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d culture, suggested last week that Mr. Kalanick should only come back if he\u2019s \u201cgenuinely committed to Uber 2.0.\u201dAssuming there is a magic pill to fix Uber\u2019s culture, the next step will be fixing the business.Uber\u2019s original approach was more sprint than marathon. Believing he could pre-emptively wipe out the competition by amassing more money and market share early on, Mr. Kalanick employed a hyperactive management style that prized speed over integrity. But the finish line never really appeared.Uber still believes that it has superior technology and data science that gives it lower costs per ride than competitors, says a source close to the company. If Uber is right and it can maintain an advantage like this in the long term, it could endure a long war of attrition with its competitors. But since neither Uber nor its competitors are public companies, no one knows the actual unit cost of their rides.In the U.S., Uber\u2019s biggest competitor, Lyft, has rapidly closed the distance with Uber by some of the most important measures, and has reached that point with far less investment. Lyft is now in the same number of markets as Uber, and in major cities can match Uber on both price and speed of service, says a company spokesperson. Lyft\u2019s share of rides in the U.S. grew from 10% to 25% between June 2015 to June 2017, according to TXN Solutions, which tracks credit-card transactions. Lyft grew further with the grass-roots #deleteuber social-media campaign, launched in response to politics and allegations of sexism inside the company.Uber\u2019s service is still better in the suburbs and commuter towns, but Lyft is starting to reach more of them, having added 150 markets in the past four months. Most important, both companies generate the bulk of their revenue in the biggest U.S. markets\u2014not coincidentally, the markets in which Uber claims to have become profitable.In China, another key battleground, Uber bowed out entirely. Uber continues to aggressively pursue international markets, but this growth is costing it dearly. Uber lost $708 million in the first quarter of 2017, despite $3.8 billion in revenue.In some ways, Uber still has the wind at its back: Overall demand for rides is surging. Uber has said the number of rides it completed in the first quarter of 2017 tripled compared to a year earlier. Even if Uber continued to be the most notorious company in Silicon Valley, momentum\u2014and its $7.2 billion cash hoard\u2014should guarantee its survival. The danger is the company fails to meet the inflated expectations of its $68 billion valuation.Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon weren\u2019t first movers in their industries, but they had superior technology and infrastructure. Apple\u2019s brand and proprietary software and services gave it the pricing power to generate huge profits. Google\u2019s search and ad technology outclassed its competitors. Facebook capitalized on the network effect that increased its utility as more people joined. Amazon got so good at building cloud services for itself that it started selling them to others\u2014reaping huge profits.And Uber? Aside from the cash, it\u2019s got a (tarnished) brand and an app that has been widely copied. Uber could once plausibly claim that the company with the most customers could support the most drivers, creating a virtuous circle where mass plus engineering might yield an unbeatable customer experience.Now, the preponderance of its competitors, ably luring away customers and drivers, suggests that the ride-sharing market will come to resemble something far less sexy\u2014and less profitable. Uber may just be a gigantic taxi company after all.Uber aspired to be the dominant marketplace where everyone from drivers to self-driving car manufacturers would be forced to sell their services. It\u2019s now just as likely that Uber will be one of that industry\u2019s many players, competing in a race to the bottom on both price and service, says Carlo Ratti, the director of MIT\u2019s Senseable City Lab, who builds models of the future of transportation.A logical response to all this competition would be vertical integration. Uber won\u2019t lock down its drivers with employee contracts, but it could (eventually) control a fleet of self-driving cars. It\u2019s still possible autonomous vehicles provide the moat that helps Uber reach tech-giant status, but there are plenty of reasons to believe they will hand the advantage to Uber\u2019s competitors instead.Uber faces a huge opportunity to reform a company badly in need of it. But even if Uber can change its ways, the question for the company\u2019s board, employees and investors is whether it\u2019s too late for Uber to become more than just another ride-sharing company.Write to Christopher Mims at christopher.mims@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Lyft\u2019s share of rides in the U.S. grew from 10% to 25% between June 2015 to June 2017, according to TXN Solutions, which tracks credit-card transactions.

MediaLink threw its famous VIP bash at the luxury H\u00f4tel du Cap-Eden-Roc, featuring The Weeknd and lots of awkward dad dancing. Yacht alley was in full swing, as young ad tech entrepreneurs who have made their millions welcomed thirsty delegates on board with endless bottles of ros\u00e9. And Spotify held the first of two bashes on the beach, with French rockers Phoenix entertaining the lucky delegates who turned up early enough to get in. (Not that I have FOMO, or anything.)Advertisers love their annual pilgrimage to Cannes for its glitz and glamor, but apparently are less keen on being roughly 50 miles from the demilitarized zone. Olympics broadcaster NBC usually treats its advertisers to corporate hospitality at the Games, but the Winter Games that take place in Pyeongchang, South Korea next year could be different. NBCUniversal\u2019s head of ad sales, Linda Yaccarino, told The Wall Street Journal in Cannes that the company might instead host events in Jackson Hole, Wyo. or another location because clients are worried about security. NBCU will still have about 1,000 people on the ground in South Korea, including production staff. It\u2019s another blow for the International Olympic Committee, which last week lost longtime sponsor McDonald\u2019s. The fast-food chain said it was ending its partnership with the Olympics after more than half a century to \u201cfocus on different priorities.\u201dThere are even people planning to abstain from Cannes! Publicis Groupe\u2019s new boss Arthur Sadoun is making his mark on the annual ad jaunt this year by, er, ordering the French holding company to sit it out next year, Adweek reports. No Cannes, no CES, no SXSW \u201cor other paid promotional events for more than a year.\u201d That\u2019s got to take the fizz out of the festivities this week for creatives who live for these awards. Publicis says it\u2019s shifting the cost savings into a new platform called Marcel (named after the company\u2019s founder Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet) that will use \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d to keep its 80,000 employees connected and figure out which people from different markets around the group can work best together on client projects. The technology would, for example, ping all its creative directors to let them know about a cool beer brief in Argentina and let them bid to take part. One CEO of a rival agency network told me: \u201cIt\u2019s basically a glorified database to get people to work harder.\u201dIf you were thinking of making an ad referencing a travel ban or leakers or Brexit, or one where James Comey is the celebrity endorser, you might want to take a step back. As CMO Today\u2019s Jack Marshall reported, the advice from marketing experts at Cannes this week is to \u201csteer clear of politics altogether.\u201d As Jack previously reported in \u201cThe Ad Maze,\u201d it can be tempting to weigh in on zeitgeisty political issues to tap into what consumers are all talking about -- but even the slightest misstep can blow up into a public-relations firestorm. Speaking at a panel hosted by The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Mark Penn, who has worked in advertising and politics and now serves as president of private equity firm The Stagwell Group, advised: \u201cThe implications for corporations that get sucked into this are not good. You want to stay as far removed from politics as possible.\u201dThe iPhone was many things. A re-invention of the phone. The birth of the app. It was also a marketing sensation.

Consumers hate it when we bombard their screens and are blocking our ads!\u201d The iPhone, and the smartphone more generally, is now so ubiquitous that it\u2019s hard to imagine what communications device will succeed it in the next 10 years. As the article notes, perhaps it\u2019s voice-activated assistants -- although that\u2019s an area in which Apple is surprisingly playing second fiddle to Amazon and Google.It took barely a blink of a Barbie doll eye for Apple\u2019s iPhone to reach 1.2 billion users.Diversity advocate and Airbnb CMO Jonathan Mildenhall hanging out with civil rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson: \u201cbeing schooled by RevJessieJackson 2 pick up & help finish what he has started He gone gave me the right 2 speak. & Ido have things Imgonsay,\u201d Mr. Mildenhall tweeted.Say hello to the WSJ\u2019s Cannes Bureau!

It tends to soar as stocks fall and investors turn anxious.In academic circles, the duo has for years quietly fumed that Mr. Whaley\u2019s work is based on theirs. The popularity of the gauge has grown as it declined to record lows this year, pushing some investors to fret over market complacency.The resulting interest in the VIX\u2019s history has prompted Messrs. Brenner and Galai to openly dispute the common knowledge of how one of the most popular market measures came to be.\u201cThere were many occasions that I wanted to come out with it, even though it\u2019s a 20-year-old story,\u201d Mr. Brenner told The Wall Street Journal in his first public comments about the disagreement. \u201cBut every time I said, \u2018Let\u2019s be positive.\u2019\u201dMr. Whaley stands behind his work and the credit it has earned him as the VIX\u2019s developer. He said that while the idea of a volatility index long was discussed in general terms, including by Messrs. Brenner and Galai, he was the first to create a formula calculated in real time.A spokeswoman for the exchange said, \u201cCBOE engaged Professor Robert Whaley to develop the original methodology for the CBOE Volatility Index.\u201d The spokeswoman added, \u201cThe staff involved with the development of the original index are no longer at CBOE and we have no one who can comment on what transpired.\u201dMessrs. Brenner and Galai say that at the center of their work was the idea to create what they called synthetic options prices that consistently showed implied volatility over the next 30 days. Because S&P 500 options had monthly expirations, they needed to find a way to create something that didn\u2019t exist: a series of options prices whose time until expiration never changed.Once they had that, they say they had the pieces in place for a consistently updating index. They pitched the idea of the index to the American Stock Exchange and the CBOE in the mid-1980s, but nothing came of it, according to the two academics and correspondence written at the time. In 1989, they jointly published research on the idea of the index, as well as on a derivatives market built around the index.Mr. Galai said he first explained the details of the work he was doing to Mr. Whaley when the two were expert witnesses on a legal case in 1988 and 1989. \u201cWe had long days and nights working on the case,\u201d Mr. Galai said.Mr. Whaley remembers working on that case and said a conversation about volatility indexes could have taken place although he didn\u2019t recall anything specific. He said in a written response to questions that he had such discussions with many people during that period, given that the general idea had been circulating in certain corners of academia.Mr. Whaley had also been doing work on volatility before CBOE hired him to create the VIX. He said that he had been aware of some of the work done by Messrs. Brenner and Galai, and cited it in research published in 1993, but that they didn\u2019t have a formula or specific computations for index levels. He considers his creation of the formula to be the heart of his work, he said.\u201cThe CBOE asked me to build an implied market volatility index and show them how it performed, and that\u2019s what I did,\u201d he said.Write to Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/academics-clash-over-vix-bragging-rights-1498046401", "news_title": "Academics Clash Over VIX Bragging Rights ", "keywords": "cboe volatility index,low volatility,markets news,stock market,u.s. stock futures,vix,volatility,who created the vix,Chicago Board Options Exchange,CBOE,Hebrew University of Jerusalem,New York University,Dan Galai,Menachem Brenner,Robert Whaley,equity markets,derivative securities,commodity,financial market news,equity derivatives,financial investments,securities,commodity exchange activities,financial services,investing"}, {"content": "Oracle Corp.

Oracle also wants to compete in the infrastructure-as-a-service market dominated by             Amazon.com Inc.,        AMZN 0.24%Microsoft Corp.       and             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google. In that market, its modest growth\u2014just 17% in the fiscal third quarter\u2014has been swamped by larger gains from its biggest rival, Amazon, whose web business grew 43% in the most recent quarter. The new quarterly data will show if Oracle has been able to make any headway.\u2014CAPEX WATCH: Amazon, Microsoft and Google spent a combined $31.54 billion in 2016 in capital expenditures and capital leases, much of it on data centers to deliver cloud-infrastructure services. Oracle\u2019s capital spending in the same window was just $1.7 billion. The company has said it doesn\u2019t believe it needs to spend as much as rivals to catch up, arguing its technology is superior. That said, Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback wrote in a research note that capital spending, as well as operating expenses, will need to \u201cexpand meaningfully should management be serious\u201d about creating a global cloud-infrastructure business.\u2014REVENUE FLATLINING: If analysts\u2019 forecasts are right, Oracle\u2019s annual revenue will climb 1% to $37.40 billion -- the third consecutive year in which Oracle hasn\u2019t posted meaningful growth. In the previous fiscal year, Oracle\u2019s revenue fell 3%; and the year before that, it slipped than 1%. The flatlining revenue comes as Oracle transitions from selling software licenses to one that sells cloud-computing subscriptions.\u2014NEW METRICS: Analysts at Morgan Stanley & Co., RBC Capital Markets and Stifel Nicolaus & Co., among others, all expect Oracle to announce new financial metrics for the coming fiscal year. RBC\u2019s Ross MacMillan wrote in a research note that he expects Oracle to create two segments under software revenue\u2014one for applications and the other for database and technology. The anticipated changes, he wrote, will provide insight into growth trends in each area, though he cautioned they \u201cwill remove clarity\u201d as businesses get mixed together that have varying gross margins.Write to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oracle-earnings-what-to-watch-1498046400", "news_title": "Oracle Earnings: What to Watch ", "keywords": "earnings,revenue,Amazon.com,AMZN,Oracle,ORCL,financial performance,earnings projections,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,computer services,cloud computing,business,consumer services,computing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "Travis Kalanick,        Uber Technologies Inc.\u2019s co-founder, has joined an illustrious list of Silicon Valley leaders forced out of running the companies they built. He resigned late Tuesday after a group of investors pressured him to step down.Sometimes the companies went on to staggering success after the founder\u2019s departure. Sometimes they faltered. Sometimes, the ousted founder returned, with mixed results. Here are just a few cases of what happens when a technology company pushes out a founder.Steve Jobs,        Apple Inc.The most famous example, of course, is the late Jobs. With the board\u2019s backing, Apple Chief Executive       John Sculley       in 1985 fired Jobs after he tried to get Mr. Sculley\u2014whom Jobs had lured away from             PepsiCo                   just two years earlier\u2014fired.\u201cI didn\u2019t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me,\u201d he said at a 2005 Stanford University commencement speech. \u201cThe heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.\u201dJobs went on to run software company NeXT and Pixar Animation Studios, helping create \u201cToy Story.\u201d In 1997, he returned to Apple after it acquired NeXT. During his second Apple tenure, Jobs released some of the company\u2019s most iconic technological innovations, including the iPod and iPhone. He remained chief executive until about a month before he died in 2011.Jerry Yang,        Yahoo Inc.Mr. Yang was pressured out of Yahoo leadership not once, but twice. He was chief executive from 2007 to 2009, when he left that position after critics savaged him for rejecting a             Microsoft Corp.\u2019s       offer to buy the company for $45 billion. He remained in management, as a \u201cChief Yahoo,\u201d focusing on strategy and stayed on the board.In 2012, though, he left after investors questioned whether his many roles at Yahoo, including co-founder, director and largest shareholder, saddled him with conflicts of interest as the company explored selling itself.Today, Mr. Yang is a board director at a few companies, including Chinese tech giant             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.       Yahoo, which he co-founded in 1995, sold itself to Verizon Communications Inc. for $4.5 billion this year.Jack Dorsey,        Twitter Inc.Three of Twitter\u2019s co-founders have been its chief executive. Mr. Dorsey was a nose-ring-wearing, dreadlocked one until 2008, when he was pushed out after disagreements over another co-founder.He returned to Twitter in 2011 as a product chief while remaining chief executive of mobile-payment startup             Square Inc.       In 2015, Twitter promoted Mr. Dorsey to chief executive once again\u2014while allowing him to remain Square\u2019s boss too.In April, Twitter reported sliding revenue for the first time. Square in May said it had slashed losses faster than expected and plans to expand to the U.K.Mike Lazaridis,             Research In Motion Ltd.Mr. Lazaridis founded the BlackBerry phone maker in 1984 with a loan from his parents and later ran the company with co-CEO       Jim Balsillie.       On a Sunday in 2012, the pair stepped down after investors clamored for new leadership as the company struggled to keep up with phones running Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android software.Mr. Lazaridis now runs a quantum-science computing fund with the other RIM co-founder. RIM renamed itself BlackBerry Ltd., quit making phones itself and focuses on mobile software.Parker Conrad, ZenefitsIn 2015, Parker Conrad\u2019s two-year-old Zenefits was valued at $4.5 billion. The startup gave its human-resources software to small businesses for free and made money by acting as an online broker for health-insurance plans.Scrutiny quickly focused in on regulatory compliance. \u201cThe fact is that many of our internal processes, controls, and actions around compliance have been inadequate, and some decisions have just been plain wrong,\u201d       David Sacks,        Mr. Conrad\u2019s successor, said in a letter to employees announcing Mr. Conrad\u2019s departure in 2016. \u201cAs a result, Parker has resigned.\u201dMr. Sacks himself left the job after 10 months. Shortly thereafter, Zenefits laid off 45% of its staff.

The oversupply is proving immune to the limits set by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its big-producer allies like Russia who last month extended a deal to limit output.Here are five reasons oil prices are under pressure.1. The Libyan and Nigerian wild cardsOil production in conflict torn Libya, which is exempted from the OPEC output deal, has surprised on the upside. Despite the continued civil war in the country, which has Africa\u2019s largest oil reserves, Libyan output has recently climbed to 885,000 barrels a day, roughly three times its level from just a year ago.\u00a0Nigeria, also exempted from the OPEC agreement due to militant attacks on its oil infrastructure, is another wild-card. Last month, its production rose to 1.68 million barrels a day, its highest level in a year, according to OPEC data.2. OPEC\u2019s dealThe price falls come despite an agreement last month by OPEC and 10 other producers to extended their deal to limit output by about 1.8 million barrels a day through March 2018.\u00a0But despite generally high compliance to the agreement, OPEC last week acknowledged that its efforts weren\u2019t working as quickly as it thought they would.             Morgan Stanley                   analysts said\u00a0Monday\u00a0the oil glut would grow again next year unless OPEC cuts deeper or extends its deal through 2018.3. Brimming crude tanksOPEC had hoped to drain bloated global stockpiles of crude. However, oil stockpiles in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2014a club of 35 countries with industrialized economies\u2014rose by 18.6 million barrels in April and were higher than they were when OPEC agreed to its cut late last year, said the International Energy Agency, which advises governments on energy trends.\u00a0Many analysts expect inventories to start falling in the second half of the year as the output cuts and stronger demand sap crude inventories. But even so, \u201cglobal oil inventories have been receding much more slowly than anticipated and remain well above historical levels,\u201d said       Carsten Menke,        commodities analyst at             Julius Baer.4. Rising U.S. productionU.S. production remains robust despite oil\u2019s price falls. American shale drillers survived the price crash by focusing on their best acreage and making technological improvements. Now some can be profitable with prices as low as $40 a barrel.\u00a0The IEA estimates that U.S. crude supply will grow almost 5% on average this year, and nearly 8% in 2018, potentially even vaulting American producers ahead of Saudi Arabia in daily output.5. Speculator frenzyAhead of the May OPEC meeting, speculators such as hedge funds and other big investors had placed a record number of bets that oil would rise. After OPEC disappointed traders by not cutting deeper or extending the deal\u2019s length further, investors started unwinding their positions, exacerbating the price falls.Net long positions in Brent crude\u2014or bets on rising prices\u2014fell by around half last week from a record high in February, according to data by             Intercontinental Exchange Inc.       \u201cAt the moment it would be a suicide to go long,\u201d said       Tamas Varga,        analyst at broker PVM. \u201cThe sentiment is bearish and speculators are ruling the day.\u201dWrite to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 07:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-reasons-why-oil-is-falling-1498043484", "news_title": "Five Reasons Why Oil Is Falling ", "keywords": "oil markets,oil prices,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,output,production,corporate,industrial news,existing products,services,product stockpile,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction"}, {"content": "Good morning,Uber\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, Travis Kalanick, has resigned after a group of investors pressured him to step down following a bruising six months of scandals and setbacks\u2014a stunning turnabout for one of Silicon Valley\u2019s highest-flying startups. Mr. Kalanick, 40 years old, handed in his resignation Tuesday, a spokesman said. Several investors pushed Mr. Kalanick to resign as part of an effort to overhaul the ride-sharing company as it faces allegations that its workplace is permissive of sexual harassment and sexism. Uber, which has no successor to Mr. Kalanick, has been running without financial and operating chiefs and other top executives after the recent departure of several company officials\u2014including one of his top deputies, who was pushed out by the board last week. Mr. Kalanick had been on an indefinite leave from the company that began last week.Oil prices have again entered bear-market territory, frustrating OPEC members that cut production in an attempt to increase prices and renewing investors\u2019 fears of spillover effects on other markets, as global stocks extended losses overnight. A persistent glut has weighed on crude prices for most of the past three years, a blow to investors who believed that a recent move by OPEC to limit production would provide relief. Instead, U.S. producers ramped up production when the world was already swimming in oil as OPEC members, Russia and other producing countries curtailed output. Prices are down more than 20% since Feb. 23, marking the sixth bear market for crude in four years and the first since August. On the Nymex, West Texas Intermediate futures were at $43.31 a barrel this morning. Brent crude, the global benchmark, was at $45.88. When the oil-price plunge gathered steam at the end of 2015, analysts blamed crude in part for sparking selloffs in other commodities, emerging markets and other risky assets. There are also signs that anxiety is spreading to the debt market.Republicans held on to a hotly contested U.S. House seat in Georgia on Tuesday, beating back an aggressive challenge that showed the Democrats\u2019 inability to turn opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency into electoral gains. Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, defeated Jon Ossoff, a onetime congressional aide, in the most expensive House race in history and the most significant test of the two parties\u2019 political strength since Mr. Trump\u2019s election. The result was a big blow to Democrats, who spent the lion\u2019s share of the money and had been hungry for a victory to demonstrate that grass-roots, anti-Trump energy gives them a shot at taking control of the House in the 2018 midterms. In a special election in South Carolina, Republican Ralph Norman won the House seat vacated by Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, but by a far narrower margin than expected.Ford\u2019s production of its Focus compact for the U.S. market is now headed for China\u2014not Mexico\u2014as the car maker seeks cost savings globally even as the Trump administration works to keep automotive jobs at home. Last year, Ford said it would move its once-hot Focus to Mexico in 2018. Under the plan revealed Tuesday, production of the car in Michigan would end next year and Ford would begin importing Focuses from China in the latter half of 2019. The auto maker, which already makes Focuses in China, said building the next-generation Focus there rather than in an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, would save the company $500 million. Ford said relocating the Focus wouldn\u2019t result in any job losses at the Michigan plant.Delays and commuter complaints are mounting at many of the U.S.\u2019s largest transit systems, including those in New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and Boston.

Sometimes I ask myself why vote\u2026I know my opinion if different from that party has no chance of counting in state and national elections. Gerrymandering gives too much power to one party and takes away the right of every citizen to have an equal vote. I would like to see it declared unconstitutional.\u201d Joel McLemore of Georgia wrote: \u201cHighly partisan gerrymanders by elected representatives do much less damage to the culture than do high-minded tut-tuts by unelected, appointed-for-life elitists.\u201d Doug Coursen of Michigan commented: \u201cGerrymandering is wrong, no matter the party that is doing it. This is not a partisan issue and I hope that the Supreme Court can look past their political beliefs and the current political climate to make a decision reaffirming the power of the individual vote.\u201d And Otte Boersma of Oregon shared: \u201cGerrymandering districts favors those in power over any challenger. It favors the status quo, it represents a bigger challenge to honest representative democracy than any voter fraud ever will have. It is out of control.

The firm, founded in 2012, has raised a total of $189 million so far with investors. The latest investment isn\u2019t part of the roughly $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund the Japanese firm launched in May with Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund.A string of high-profile cyberattacks, including last month\u2019s WannaCry ransomware assault that was linked to North Korea and a series of breaches at internet giant Yahoo Inc. have exposed how hackers are quickly discovering new ways to unearth network vulnerabilities. A spate of startups like Cybereason are pitching a new generation of computer security products that use machine learning and computer algorithms to sniff out problems before they spread.The WannaCry attack was spotted instantaneously by Cybereason\u2019s algorithms\u2014requiring no human intervention\u2014and no clients were affected, said Lior Div, Cybereason\u2019s chief executive, and a former decorated Israeli cyberintelligence officer, in an interview. The firm\u2019s clients, including SoftBank and             Lockheed Martin Corp.      , use Cybereason often in tandem with legacy services offered by             Symantec Corp.       or McAfee LLC.\u201cToday we\u2019re the last line of defense, but I would argue we\u2019re the only line of defense\u2014because the first line of defense is not working,\u201d said Mr. Div, 39 years old.Cybereason is one of several new cybersecurity startups attracting interest from deep-pocketed investors. Tanium, the world\u2019s most valuable cybersecurity startup, valued at $3.75 billion, and CrowdStrike, which helped the Democratic National Committee respond last year to a network breach linked to Russia, both raised $100 million last month. Another cyber firm, Illumio, raised $125 million earlier this month.SoftBank, which spans a Japanese telecom arm, U.S. mobile carrier             Sprint Corp.      , and U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings Inc., is increasing its investment staff around the world, betting on technology that it says will be key when everyday items like shoes and microwaves are connected to the internet.The company recently led a funding round for London-based startup Improbable, which designs virtual worlds for videogames and simulations that can be applied to the real world, as well as             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       robot units.Global security spending is forecast to hit $81.7 billion in 2017, according to market researcher International Data Corp., with forecasts of growth to about $105 billion in 2020. Meanwhile, information-technology startup investments rose to $3.05 billion during the first three months of this year, up 13% from the same period in 2016, according to data from Dow Jones VentureSource.This new generation of antivirus companies are poised to grow as the industry moves away from blocking hackers by creating digital fingerprints\u2014or signatures\u2014of computer worms and viruses to stop them.These new firms can offer more, said       Ted Schlein,        general partner with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture-capital firm, which has invested in Carbon Black Inc., a Cybereason competitor.\u201cWe are transforming ourselves into the post-signature world,\u201d Mr. Schlein said.Cybereason will use SoftBank\u2019s cash injection to further develop its technology, hire more employees and potentially acquire some smaller firms, Mr. Div said. The firm was founded by Mr. Div and two other ex-members of Israel\u2019s Unit 8200, the equivalent to the U.S. National Security Agency.Talented hackers will almost always figure out a way to bust into a network, but the key is identifying those initial breaches and preventing deep damage, Mr. Div said.The Cybereason platform\u2014which the firm boasts is \u201cmilitary-grade\u201d\u2014is automated and powered by artificial intelligence, able to track vast networks in real-time. \u201cCybersecurity is a problem that\u2019s not going away,\u201d Mr. Div said. \u201cThe problem will keep evolving forever.\u201d\u2014Mayumi Negishi contributed to this article.Write to Timothy W.

But breakdowns and dwindling participation have dogged the weekly online auction. The exchange has crashed multiple times so far this month; last week\u2019s auction was called off altogether.As a result, traders say the auction isn\u2019t providing the promised reality check for pricing in the $19 billion cattle-futures market. Without real-time data on the price meatpackers are paying for the cattle they purchase from feedlots, traders say futures have become too speculative. Some believe a market that is meant to provide a hedge against what cattle might cost in the future has become dislocated from the real world, leaving feedlots unsure what their herds are worth.\u201cIt\u2019s become increasingly difficult to use [futures] as a hedging tool because of the huge swings that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Justin Tupper, a cattle rancher in St. Onge, S.D. \u201cIt looks a lot more like a gambling fund.\u201dTake feeder cattle, animals that need to be fattened before slaughter. Earlier this month, feeder-cattle futures hit a 14-month high at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange before falling to the bottom of their allowed daily trading band\u2014all in about an hour. A circuit breaker kicked in to prevent further losses. Analysts and traders said they saw little in the real world to justify the gyration.\u201cThere are days where I look at the futures, knowing what I know about the fundamentals, and say, \u2018Are we on two different pages?\u2019 \u201d said John Nalivka, president of advisory firm Sterling Marketing Inc. in Vale, Ore.Public cattle prices became scarce over the past decade as the share of cattle sold on the open market fell sharply. That shift reflected consolidation among both ranchers and meat companies into a few large players that favor contracts over auctions as the most efficient way to sell the 30 million or more cattle slaughtered in the U.S. each year.The             CME                   stopped listing new live cattle contracts last year as concerns over their volatility intensified. This month, the CME said it would relist contracts that better mirror real-world cattle trades and improve efficiency by redefining the quality of the beef in question and protocol for the cattle\u2019s physical delivery. The CME also increased by about 15% the collateral needed to place bets on its exchanges.\u201cWe want to make sure we have an efficient tool,\u201d said Fred Seamon, CME Group\u2019s director of commodity product development.Mr. Seamon welcomed the Fed Cattle Exchange\u2019s efforts to generate more price data that might calm trading on the CME as well. He said the two companies aren\u2019t working together.The new auctions lost some momentum last year during a nearly three-month outage to address technical issues. Sales on the Fed Cattle Exchange have dwindled to as little as a few hundred in recent weeks from a few thousand earlier this year. Analysts say the lower volume partly reflects a cattle-supply pinch that has led feedyards to strike deals with slaughterhouses in advance.To compensate participants for the recent crashes, Superior Livestock waived fees of a dollar a head to sell cattle on the exchange for the remainder of June.Sam Hughes, the Fed Cattle Exchange\u2019s Oklahoma City-based manager, said the company wants to attract more buyers and sellers. The company has reverted to an older website while building a more stable auction platform.\u201cIt is concerning at times, whenever the volume is low,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. \u201cPeople were kind of scratching their heads last week because this is the first time since September that people haven\u2019t had a readily available price,\u201d referring to the suspended auction.Still, some frustrated traders say they are willing to stick with it in hopes that the auction would eventually provide more reliable ballast for futures prices.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t make it, then we\u2019re back to the same mess that we were in,\u201d said Dan Norcini, an independent trader in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho. \u201cThat makes these cattle futures markets almost impossible to trade.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-21 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thin-trading-hobbles-online-cattle-auction-1498042800", "news_title": "Thin Trading Hobbles Online Cattle Auction ", "keywords": "Superior Livestock Auction,commodity markets,agricultural commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,beef,dairy cattle markets,livestock,meat markets,agriculture,farming,cattle farming,beef cattle farming,livestock farming"}, {"content": "Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Travis Kalanick\u2019s resignation follows a turbulent few months for both him and the company he founded, encompassing scandals and missteps that tested the faith of investors and the public. Here\u2019s a quick glance at the events that preceded the 40-year-old\u2019s departure.19\u2014Former Uber software engineer Susan Fowler Rigetti claims in a nearly 3,000-word blog post that the company\u2019s management had ignored multiple complaints from her and other female workers of sexual harassment and sexism by their managers. Ms. Fowler Rigetti\u2019s allegations sparked a firestorm almost instantly, prompting Mr. Kalanick within hours to condemn the alleged behavior and order an investigation. Media mogul       Arianna Huffington,        the only woman on Uber\u2019s board and an investor, immediately jumped to action, saying she would be helping with the investigation.23\u2014Google parent             Alphabet Inc.sues the ride-hailing company for allegedly stealing trade secrets to jump-start its own autonomous vehicle program, the latest salvo in the friendship-turned-rivalry between the two tech giants.28\u2014A video emerges showing Mr. Kalanick berating Uber driver Fawzi Kamel. In it, Mr. Kalanick lashes out at the driver, who had asked him questions about fares at the end of a recent trip. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like to take responsibility [for themselves],\u201d Mr. Kalanick says in the video.1\u2014Mr. Kalanick vows to \u201cgrow up\u201d and says he was \u201cashamed\u201d of the behavior captured by the driver\u2019s dashboard camera.23\u2014Uber says it had mistakenly underpaid New York City drivers for the past 2\u00bd years, an error likely costing it tens of millions of dollars. It was the second time in three months the ride-hailing company had acknowledged it deprived workers of their proper earnings.1\u2014Uber says its head of finance, Gautam Gupta, is leaving as the ride-hailing company reported a $708 million loss for the first quarter, despite generating revenue of $3.4 billion.13\u2014The company announces partial results of a nearly four-month investigation into its culture by former U.S. Attorney General       Eric Holder\u2019s       law firm. The recommendations include transferring some of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s responsibilities to other managers, and zeroes in on aspects of a corporate culture it says reinforces exclusionary and other poor behavior.13\u2014Private-equity billionaire and Uber board member       David Bonderman      resigns hours after he made a disparaging remark about women during a companywide meeting to address problems with the company\u2019s workplace culture. \u201cI directed a comment to my colleague and friend Arianna Huffington that was careless, inappropriate, and inexcusable,\u201d Mr. Bonderman says.13\u2014Mr. Kalanick says he would take indefinite leave from the company he built into the world\u2019s most valuable startup. \u201cIf we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve,\u201d he says.20\u2014Mr. Kalanick resigns following investor pressure to step down after a succession of scandals.", "news_time": "2017-06-21 06:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ubers-really-bad-year-1498042091", "news_title": "Uber\u2019s Really Bad Year", "keywords": " kalanick, travis kalanick,uber, uber ceo,Uber Technologies,Alphabet Inc.

Chinese conglomerate Cosco Group is in advanced discussions to acquire Hong Kong-based Orient Overseas Container Line Co., the WSJ\u2019s Costas Paris reports, in a deal worth at least $4 billion that could be concluded by next month. The transaction would be the first since a series of acquisitions and new alliance tie-ups, along with the collapse of Korea\u2019s Hanjin Shipping, redrew global container shipping maps. Buying OOCL, the world\u2019s seventh-largest container line, would vault state-owned Cosco Group\u2019s Cosco Shipping unit ahead of CMA CGM SA as the No. 3 carrier in the world, with nearly 12% of the world\u2019s capacity. It would also mark a dramatic change for decades-old OOCL, which is controlled by Hong Kong\u2019s storied Tung family. Those owners now are weighing terms to turn the business over to a operator that is carrying China\u2019s burgeoning maritime power around the globe.The owner of             T.J. Maxx                   and Marshalls is using old-fashioned retail supply chain smarts to turn the competition with             Amazon.com Inc.       upside down. While most traditional retailers are in crisis under the online threat, TJX Co. is marching ahead, the WSJ\u2019s Suzanne Kapner writes, reporting rising same-store sales for 33 straight quarters and getting almost all of its sales from its growing lineup of some 3,800 physical stores. The company isn\u2019t shifting business online or using big data to figure out what shoppers want. It relies on veteran merchandise buyers that use their instincts to buy from some 18,000 suppliers and on the fast and unrelenting replenishment of merchandise to keep customers searching for deals. Amazon is coming after clothing sellers: the online giant is rolling out a service allowing its Prime members to try on clothes at home. Prime Wardrobe is aimed at taking business from department stores, but TJX doesn\u2019t mind the disruption. The big stores are canceling more apparel orders as sales fall, pushing more discounted clothing through TJX\u2019s fast-moving distribution channels.A legal battle between             Apple Inc.       and one of its major suppliers is getting rougher. The electronics behemoth is broadening its legal offensive against             Qualcomm,       arguing in a court filing that some of the chip supplier\u2019s patents were invalid and that its business model violates patent law. The dispute began over royalty payments for technology marks a rare standoff between heavyweights in the smartphone supply chain, and the WSJ\u2019s Tripp Mickle reports it reaches into Apple\u2019s contract manufacturers. Qualcomm says Apple is mischaracterizing its business and is suing four Apple manufacturers for withholding royalty payments on Qualcomm technology. A new twist came in a recent Supreme Court affirmation that patent holders can\u2019t keep rights over a product after it is sold, a principle Apple says Qualcomm is violating with its royalty demand. Questions over ownership and control of the technology that underpins components figure prominently in electronics supply chains, where the outcome of the Apple-Qualcomm dispute will be closely watched.Boeing Co.       is looking deeper into the aerospace supply chain for profits. The aircraft manufacturer will open a special unit next month that will oversee after-sales services for its commercial and military jets, the WSJ\u2019s Doug Cameron reports, expanding its effort to get more revenue from parts and services once customers start flying its planes. That\u2019s a lucrative business that\u2019s created a broad eco-system of suppliers and services companies that provide parts and also rack up big margins with an array of services. Aircraft engine makers, for instance, generate earnings from maintenance and also parse big reams of data to help airlines fly more efficiently. Boeing says it holds only 8% of the aerospace services market, but its bid to boost its share and its margin is already triggering tensions with suppliers.             Rolls-Royce Holdings                   PLC says the sector will invest less in technology for new jets if the plane maker encroaches too deeply in its turf.Some companies want to bring logistics and technology to a big business that has little of either. A handful of startups are trying to change the self-storage business by adding sophisticated new services to a sector that generates some $30 billion in revenue by relying on its customers to do all the heavy lifting. The WSJ\u2019s       Peter Grant       reports that new operators such as Clutter Inc. and MakeSpace Labs Inc. are using the latest in logistics and web technology to offer what they claim is a more efficient and user-friendly way for people to store goods. The new competitors pick up and deliver items instead of forcing customers to haul items to their facilities, and they consider themselves to be logistics operators rather than real-estate managers. It\u2019s the kind of business model that pervasive technology makes possible, and the startups say they\u2019re taking lessons from across the tech world.

By 2020, the research firm expects that viewership to climb to 286 million.Most people watch online, though, and getting those viewers to find esports programming on the TV has been a challenge.Walt Disney Co.\u2019s       ESPN and             Time Warner Inc.\u2019s       TBS have aired esports for more than a year, to modest ratings. TBS\u2019s Friday night show \u201cEleague,\u201d for example, has averaged 256,000 viewers this year, down from 272,000 in 2016, according to Nielsen.Spokesmen for ESPN and TBS said ratings have been in line with expectations, and that esports on TV is still relatively new. Like ESPN and TBS, NBC Sports plans to live stream its tournament online as well to reach as many viewers as possible.ESPN and TBS say web viewership has been strong. The finale of a weeklong contest for TBS\u2019s \u201cEleague\u201d attracted more than one million concurrent streams when it aired live in January on Amazon.com\u2019s Twitch, a record for a single channel on the video service. TBS plans to air more esports in the fall, including a championship around a new superhero-fighting game called \u201cInjustice 2.\u201dEsports could still thrive on TV if contests involving more popular games are aired, Cowen & Co. analyst       Doug Creutz       said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve had tier 1 esports events on TV yet,\u201d he said.NBC Sports Network is in about 85 million homes, while its regional networks span about half as many households. The network hopes to differentiate its esports broadcast from the usual shooter or war-battle games with \u201cRocket League,\u201d a mashup of soccer and auto racing from Psyonix Inc. that was a top seller on             Sony Corp.\u2019s       PlayStation store last year.After a round of qualifiers in July, TV coverage will kick off on weekends in August on the regional networks. The tournament will conclude with a championship aired on the national network and in several countries abroad.The network also plans to open its tournament to people of all skill levels in the U.S. and Europe, rather than just professional teams.

While the two companies\u2019 stocks rose sharply and their competitors\u2019 tanked, the rest of the market remained placid. Indeed, months of historically low market volatility has begun to look like dangerous complacency.Yet there is another, potentially more troubling explanation: stagnation. Muted markets may be the inevitable product of steady, sluggish growth, low and predictable interest rates, declining business startups and failures, and decreased competition. In other words, the problem is, there aren\u2019t enough Amazons disrupting the stock market and the economy.Since       Jeffrey Bezos       founded Amazon in 1994, he has put expansion and innovation ahead of profit. In its early years, free cash flow\u2014cash from operations minus capital spending\u2014hovered around zero. Mr. Bezos approaches new products like a venture capitalist. Many will flop (like the Fire smartphone), but some will be home runs (such as Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing arm).Amazon launched Prime, which offers free delivery in exchange for an annual fee, in 2005.       John Blackledge,        an analyst at Cowen & Co., notes Amazon has repeatedly innovated in ways that make Prime even more valuable to subscribers: the Kindle e-book reader lending library, streaming video and music, discounted access to FreeTime, which offers children\u2019s books, games and media content, and Amazon Family, which offers discounts on baby products. Innovation is also exceptionally rapid. Mr. Blackledge says Prime Now, which offers same-day delivery, launched in New York in less than four months after conception without so much as a focus group.Amazon is now profitable, yet cash retention remains secondary to retaining customers. Asked by an analyst in April whether Alexa, a voice-activated assistant, was boosting sales, the company\u2019s finance chief,       Brian Olsavsky       responded: \u201cThe monetization, as you might call it, is\u2026not our primary issue right now. It\u2019s about building great products and delighting customers.\u201dIf Amazon is one extreme in how companies invest,             General Electric Co.       is the other. It has long been fastidious about capital and cash deployment. On its last quarterly earnings call, the company meticulously laid out profit growth by product and business segment, the sources of margin improvement, cost savings anticipated from specific restructuring moves\u2014even how five uncollected aviation accounts were affecting profit.Chief executive       Jack Welch       perfected this approach in the 1990s, and it continued under his successor,       Jeffrey Immelt.       Last week, Mr. Immelt said he would retire, after 16 years struggling to restore growth. In part, that reflected how financial engineering had inflated profits under Mr. Welch. Yet Mr. Immelt \u2019s investment decisions too often chased the conventional wisdom on Wall Street and in Washington. Thus, GE Capital bulked up on residential mortgages and commercial real estate in the run-up to the financial crisis. From 2010 to 2013, the company announced many acquisitions in oil and gas services, only to see the price of oil crash, taking orders with it.Growth is hard for any company that dominates its markets as much as GE does. GE\u2019s size also attracts debilitating political scrutiny. Its proposed acquisition of Honeywell was derailed by European antitrust regulators just before Mr. Immelt took over. It took 18 months for Mr. Immelt\u2019s purchase of Alstom\u2019s power business to clear regulatory barriers. GE Capital after the financial crisis became the poster child of dangerous, unregulated finance. In response to new regulations and pressure from Wall Street, Mr. Immelt largely dismantled the business.Investors still want GE to return cash to shareholders, and it has obliged, spending $79 billion on share buybacks and dividends between 2012 and 2016 compared with $50 billion of capital expenditures. Indeed, for two years, cash flow of U.S. corporations has exceeded capital spending. Much of the difference has gone into buying back stock.Yet while good for shareholders in the short run, this is no recipe for growth in the long run. GE\u2019s cash flow is shrinking despite the company\u2019s focus on preserving it, while Amazon\u2019s is growing despite that company\u2019s readiness to spend it.Amazon is clearly not a template for most companies. Defying conventional wisdom usually fails, which is why for every successful long shot like Amazon there are hundreds if not thousands of failed startups. Amazon has come near death more than once, and may again. Moreover, the larger it gets, the more it will bump against the constraints of size, such as antitrust concerns. As for GE, a history of reinvention suggests it is more likely to be around in 125 years than is Amazon. Given investors\u2019 tendency to go to extremes, now may be a bad time to buy Amazon shares, or sell GE\u2019s.Yet the country as a whole badly needs some rules-defying risk-taking. For business, that means a bit more Amazon in the boardroom and a bit less GE.Write to Greg Ip at greg.ip@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-economy-needs-amazons-but-it-mostly-has-ges-1498037403", "news_title": "The Economy Needs Amazons, but It Mostly Has GEs", "keywords": "Amazon.com,AMZN,General Electric,GE,GE Capital,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,credit types,services,sales financing,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,banking,credit,e-commerce,financial services,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "The battle between the King Kong and Godzilla of retail has moved into the cloud.Wal-Mart        WMT -0.43%       Stores Inc. is telling some technology companies that if they want its business, they can\u2019t run applications for the retailer on             Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s        AMZN 0.24%       leading cloud-computing service, Amazon Web Services, several tech companies say.Amazon\u2019s rise as the dominant player in renting on-demand, web-based computing power and storage has put some competitors, such as             Netflix Inc.,       in the unlikely position of relying on a corporate rival as they move to the cloud.Wal-Mart, loath to give any business to Amazon, said it keeps most of its data on its own servers and uses services from emerging AWS competitors, such as             Microsoft Corp.\u2019s       Azure.Wal-Mart uses some tech vendors\u2019 cloud apps that run on AWS, said Wal-Mart spokesman       Dan Toporek.

More recently, Amazon lowered its Prime membership fee by nearly half for people who obtain government assistance, targeting a Wal-Mart stronghold.Their cloud battle takes aim at the financial advantage AWS gives Amazon. The company\u2019s global retail business operates on thin margins, but they are offset by the enormous profits AWS generates. In the first quarter, AWS posted $890 million in operating income, accounting for 89% of overall operating income, even as AWS\u2019s $3.66 billion in net sales accounted for just 10% of the company\u2019s total.The notion AWS supports Amazon\u2019s retail business is incorrect, the spokeswoman said, citing the company\u2019s operating profit in its North American retail business.While Wal-Mart\u2019s efforts aren\u2019t likely to staunch AWS\u2019s growth, it could boost rivals.\u201cPeople jump through hoops to do business with Wal-Mart all the time,\u201d said       Robert Hetu,        an analyst with the research firm             Gartner Inc.       \u201cThat should absolutely accelerate the competition from Azure.\u201dIt has, Microsoft said. \u201cThe nudge from Wal-Mart has been pretty consistent,\u201d said       Judson Althoff,        executive vice president in charge of Microsoft\u2019s global sales to business customers.Microsoft had been the primary provider of cloud infrastructure to Jet.com Inc., the online retailer Wal-Mart bought for $3.3 billion last September. The retail giant named Jet\u2019s founder as its e-commerce chief. Today, Wal-Mart is among the largest users of Azure, Mr. Althoff said.The fight helped it get cloud business from the data-analytics company Nielsen Co., he added. \u201cThat\u2019s a direct customer that came because of Wal-Mart,\u201d Mr. Althoff said.Alphabet Inc.       declined to say whether Google Cloud, the No. 3 cloud-infrastructure provider, has benefited from the spat between Wal-Mart and Amazon.Lofty Labs, a software-development firm in Fayetteville, Ark., worked with a retail-analytics consulting company to build cloud-based forecasting tools for Wal-Mart. To win the business, Lofty Labs had to develop the application for Azure.\u201cThat was a deal breaker,\u201d Lofty Labs President       Casey Kinsey       said. The service is the only one Lofty Labs ever developed to work on Azure. \u201cEverybody knows that Wal-Mart will not play ball with you if you use AWS.\u201dWrite to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wal-mart-to-vendors-get-off-amazons-cloud-1498037402", "news_title": "Wal-Mart to Vendors: Get Off Amazon\u2019s Cloud", "keywords": "amazon cloud,amazon web services,wal-mart ,Amazon.com,AMZN,Wal-Mart Stores,WMT,Amazon,Alphabet Inc.

It\u2019s             General Electric Co.        GE 0.19%Over the past decade, the U.S. industrial icon has bought a number of aerospace companies and suppliers from Britain and Sweden to Italy and the Czech Republic. The deals have made GE parts ubiquitous on modern jetliners. It has grown into one of Europe\u2019s largest aerospace employers, with roughly 11,600 workers across the continent, setting it apart from many of its peers.European deals are familiar turf for       John Flannery,        who last week was named GE\u2019s new chief executive officer starting in August. He made his mark at the company leading GE\u2019s biggest industrial acquisition ever, the $17 billion purchase of France\u2019s Alstom SA power business.GE is now trying to turn its collection of disparate European aerospace assets into a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. It wants to knit the businesses into a pan-European group that can develop new equipment and tap European Union development funding.\u201cWe pick the best companies at the time wherever they are globally,\u201d       David Joyce,        GE vice chairman and boss of the aviation business said. \u201cAs long as it makes sense we buy them.\u201dRivals are watching with interest.       Eric Schulz,        president for civil aerospace at Britain\u2019s         Rolls-Royce Holdings               PLC, said \u201cGE\u2019s size has always been and I believe will always be a threat for Rolls-Royce and for the others, including their own customers.\u201d The British aircraft-engine maker is GE\u2019s biggest rival in powering the largest jetliners.But Mr. Schulz said size has drawbacks, making companies less flexible as they try to protect broader corporate interest and, as a result, fail to offer the most competitive product. Being leaner \u201cI hope gives us more creativity and innovation,\u201d Mr. Schulz said. Rolls also is investing, including in the U.S., he said.GE executives in Europe say that getting employees from a variety of companies and countries to learn the conglomerate\u2019s ways and to cooperate can be difficult, but their engineering talent benefits the group.GE\u2019s recent European spree is built on deep links. In 1941, GE built the U.S.\u2019s first jet engine based on a British design. In 1974, it teamed up with a French rival, which was building engines for the supersonic Concorde, and today their CFM International joint venture is the world\u2019s biggest producer of jet engines. In 2007, GE bought U.K. airplane-electronics maker Smiths Aerospace, expanding its aviation business beyond engines and landing gear.The company\u2019s massive plane-leasing business, GE Capital Aviation Services, known as GECAS, largely operates from Ireland and London. It has a fleet of about 1,700 planes with more than 200 customers. GECAS placed deals to buy 100             Airbus                   aircraft and another 20 from             Boeing                   on the first day of the Paris Air Show unfolding outside the French capital this week.When GE decided to expand into the civilian turboprop market, long dominated by U.S. rival Pratt & Whitney, a unit of             United Technologies Corp.      , it bought Prague-based Walter Aircraft Engines in 2008.In 2013, GE snapped up Avio Aero, an important supplier near Milan whose private-equity owner was looking to exit. The company makes vital engines components for jets, turboprops and helicopters.Last year, GE acquired 3-D printing companies in Germany and Sweden that are important suppliers to Avio, Walter and GE\u2019s engine division in the U.S. Mr. Joyce said that when GE wanted to grow its 3-D activities, it had to strike deals in Europe because that is where the expertise resided.Last week, on the day GE named Mr. Flannery its new boss, it also said it had bought OC Robotics of Bristol, England, for an undisclosed sum. The company\u2019s snake-arm robots should make repairs in difficult to reach places on wings easier.GE\u2019s European empire \u201cis something that came together almost accidentally,\u201d said       Riccardo Procacci,        a GE veteran who moved to Avio from its Italian oil-and-gas business. \u201cStepping back now, we can see we are one of the biggest aviation companies in Europe.\u201dFor GE, \u201ca strong presence in Europe brings a different perspective on the world,\u201d said Mr. Procacci.Being based in Europe allows companies to sell locally developed high-tech components like engine combustors that in the U.S. face export restrictions due to national-security concerns, he said.GE\u2019s newly grown European roots give it access to national technology funding it couldn\u2019t otherwise tap. In Italy, it has built a network of ties to universities and small business that benefit from government support.And the various acquisitions bring GE a new continent of expertise it can draw from. When GE explored the best way to create a new turboprop engines, its experts in Prague and the U.S. looked at what other units, including Avio, could offer. \u201cWe said, this is going to be a European engine,\u201d said Brad Mottier, a vice president at GE Aviation.The engine is now in development at GE locations across Europe.", "news_time": "2017-06-21 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-paris-air-show-ge-takes-role-of-american-upstart-1498037403", "news_title": "At Paris Air Show, GE Takes Role of American Upstart", "keywords": " european acquisitions, european union,general electric, jet engines, paris air show,General Electric,GE,Alstom,ALO.FR,Rolls-Royce Holdings,UK:RR.,United Technologies,UTX,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,conferences,exhibitions,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,machinery,railroad rolling stock,diversified holding companies,aerospace,defense,business,consumer services,industrial goods"}, {"content": "Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co. is copying the financing strategies of hedge funds and private-equity firms as it pursues its quest to become one of the world\u2019s largest companies.HNA, a sprawling group that operates in everything from airlines to hotels, has been on an overseas acquisition spree. Increasingly, it is financing those deals with loans backed by company stakes it has purchased. The conglomerate has also entered into complex derivatives with U.S. and European banks that are helping fund its investments outside China.Some of the arrangements are similar to those used by investment firms, which often acquire shares in companies with borrowed money. Such financial leverage, as it is known, allows buyers to stretch their capital by putting up relatively little money and borrowing the remainder from banks.The strategy can be costly and has risks. If the stocks or other assets fall in value, banks can force buyers to cough up additional funds on short notice, or sell the investments if the owners cannot meet margin calls.Still, the financing tactics are useful for HNA, which is trying to aggressively grow its revenue globally and already has a heavy debt burden.Bankers say it is relatively uncommon for corporations to use margin loans and derivatives like total return swaps to finance investments to the extent that HNA has done. Most companies that are actively acquiring other businesses are financially stronger and have simpler or cheaper ways to raise money.HNA doesn\u2019t have a credit rating, which limits its ability to access low-cost financing. Foreign banks have charged it as much as 6% on loans that typically cost 1% or 2% for companies with investment-grade ratings, according to data from Dealogic.One benefit the strategies give HNA is that they don\u2019t involve transferring money out of mainland China, because banks provide funding offshore. That effectively enables HNA to sidestep tightened capital controls implemented by the Chinese government in late 2016 to discourage firms from moving money out of the country.HNA says it isn\u2019t trying to avoid capital controls and that it has used cash from offshore entities for its purchases. It says it is instead trying to use the current low interest rate environment to earn good returns.\u201cWe try to be a smart investor,\u201d said       Guang Yang,        chief investment officer of HNA Capital, the group\u2019s finance arm. \u201cWe\u2019re not different from, let\u2019s say, some of the best private-equity funds.\u201d He added the firm wants to \u201ceffectively use leverage to the extent that\u2019s possible.\u201dBanks have been eager to advise on HNA\u2019s investments and help structure its financing arrangements. Over the past year and a half, HNA Group has paid fees totaling $100 million to global and Chinese banks for acquisitions abroad\u2014almost a fifth of all such fees paid by Chinese companies, according to Dealogic.Top-tier financial institutions are \u201cwaiting to work with us in terms of structuring those transactions,\u201d said Mr. Yang.In the past year, HNA used share-backed financing and derivatives arranged by banks such as UBS Group AG and             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. to rapidly build stakes in companies including hotel firm             Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.       and             OM Asset Management                   PLC, the U.S. money-management arm of British insurer             Old Mutual                   PLC, according to regulatory filings.The moves haven\u2019t been without problems. Swissport International Ltd., a Zurich-based air-cargo handler acquired by HNA last year, found itself in breach of debt covenants after its shares were pledged toward a loan taken out by an HNA subsidiary.Credit rater Standard & Poor\u2019s is reviewing Swissport\u2019s speculative-grade rating for a potential downgrade. It said the technical breach means Swissport cannot access a revolving credit line until the issue is resolved.Swissport discovered the covenant breach recently when HNA was in talks to inject cash into the company to restructure how it finances its business. HNA put $800 million into Swissport shortly after the breach was discovered, some of which was to help support the company\u2019s finances.HNA has spent $5.15 billion on investments abroad so far this year, following $20 billion last year, according to Dealogic. It has primarily funded those deals using debt, from bank loans and offshore bonds to leveraged buyout-style transactions and asset securitizations. Some of these methods enable HNA to use cash flows of acquired companies to pay off the debt.It is unclear how indebted HNA is as a whole. The conglomerate is made up of a web of subsidiaries and affiliates. Some debt of those entities doesn\u2019t appear on the balance sheet of HNA Group, the privately held company that is seen as the closest thing to a parent company.HNA Group itself says it had around $104 billion in debt at the end of 2016, more than twice the level calculated by data tracker S&P Global Market Intelligence. That put one commonly used measure of leverage\u2014net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda\u2014at a relatively high ratio of 10 times, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\u2018We try to be a smart investor. We\u2019re not different from, let\u2019s say, some of the best private-equity funds.\u2019Regulatory filings show HNA used margin loans to cover $81.5 million of its $446 million purchase of a 25% stake in OM Asset Management, as well as $3 billion of its $6.5 billion purchase of a 25% stake in Hilton Worldwide.Private-equity firm             Blackstone Group                   LP, which sold HNA the Hilton stake last year and still owns part of the company, has pledged its stake toward a separate margin loan.HNA used a more complicated structure known as an equity collar when it boosted its stake in Swiss airport retailer Dufry AG recently to 21% from 16.8%. A similar method was used to help finance an increase in HNA\u2019s stake in             Deutsche Bank AG       to nearly 10%, according to filings.HNA also used a total return swap to build its Deutsche stake, filings show. In such swaps, which are commonly used by hedge funds, investors pay a bank a fee to earn returns on securities they don\u2019t actually hold.For share-backed financing, banks generally don\u2019t have to worry about a borrower\u2019s ability to repay, because they can seize the stock collateral if something goes wrong. HNA structures such transactions so that any losses are capped at the value of the collateral, which limits its liabilities.And though HNA is structuring many of its investments so its units bear the debt and associated risk, those units often rely on HNA Group for support and capital, as the Swissport affair shows. Mr. Yang said, however, that HNA doesn\u2019t guarantee it will step in if subsidiaries can\u2019t meet their obligations.Write to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com and Anjani Trivedi at anjani.trivedi@wsj.comAppeared in the June 22, 2017, print edition as 'Chinese BehemothLeverages Deal Spree.'", "news_time": "2017-06-21 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-hna-takes-a-page-from-private-equity-in-financing-deal-spree-1498037405", "news_title": "This Chinese Conglomerate\u2019s Secret to Success?

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 high hopes for crude have been shredded by the sharp claws of resurgent U.S. shale.It\u2019s been a nasty few weeks for oil investors. The International Energy Agency last week cast doubt on OPEC\u2019s ability to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to drain massive global crude stocks, citing American shale production. Given the world\u2019s huge supply of crude, prices will likely struggle to head much above $60 regardless of what Saudi Arabia and its allies do.The question then becomes: How low can they go? A collapse back toward 2016 lows below $30 a barrel remains unlikely, for two key reasons.First, unlike before the big steps down in oil in 2014 and 2015, Chinese demand still looks firm. A little-noted fact about the 2014 crash is that besides a surge in supply, Chinese oil-consumption growth had also turned sharply negative in late 2013 as the economy slowed. U.S. demand growth had also weakened to nearly zero by mid-2014. It was weak oil-buying from the world\u2019s two largest consumers\u2014not just surging supply from U.S. wildcatters\u2014that caused the epic crash later that year.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.This time around, Chinese consumption growth is hovering around the 3% mark\u2014uninspiring but still better than 2016, when it was flirting with zero for much of the year. In the U.S., preliminary data indicates petroleum consumption may have bounced back in May after months of weakness: Lower prices may finally be tempting thrifty consumers back into their cars.Meanwhile, U.S. supply growth, while still strong, is showing signs of peaking as lower prices start to bite: Year-over-year growth in the number of active U.S. oil rigs slowed for the first time in 20 weeks in early June.The headwinds to oil remain strong and prices could still fall further in the weeks ahead.But unless China\u2019s growth slowdown proves much uglier than expected\u2014or U.S. consumers sit out the peak driving season in July and August\u2014oil\u2019s slippery slope probably won\u2019t carry it back down to the soggy depths of January 2016.Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 04:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rampaging-oil-bears-are-missing-half-the-picture-1498035219", "news_title": "Rampaging Oil Bears Are Missing Half the Picture", "keywords": "global oil markets ,heard on the street ,oil analysis ,oil bear market ,oil heard on the street ,oil markets ,International Energy Agency,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,heard on the street,energy"}, {"content": "CANBERRA, Australia\u2014Most Australians harbor a broad dislike for U.S. President Donald Trump and see their country\u2019s relationship with China as an economic plus rather than a threat, according to a survey, despite concerns about espionage and political meddling by Beijing.The national study by influential foreign-policy think tank the Lowy Institute comes after a rocky few months in which Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Mr. Trump clashed in a phone call over an Obama-era refugee deal. It found that some of the international unease over Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach was widespread in one of Washington\u2019s closest allies.Though only 29% of respondents thought Australia should distance itself from the U.S. under the new administration, the survey found that Mr. Trump was deeply unpopular in the Pacific nation. Around 60% of respondents said he prompted an unfavorable opinion of the U.S., which has major economic and alliance ties with Australia.The U.S. is a major investor in the country, and Australia has fought alongside American forces in every major conflict involving the U.S. since World War I. Australia is also supporting the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against Islamic State said Wednesday that it would resume bombing in Syria after suspending operations on Tuesday amid tensions between Russia and the U.S.Since Mr. Trump\u2019s election last year, trust in Washington has declined sharply. Some 61% of Australians say they trust the U.S. to \u201cact responsibly in the world.\u201d That is 22 points below the record achieved in 2011, the year the Obama administration announced America\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d to the Asia-Pacific region and Barack Obama addressed Australia\u2019s Parliament.The survey takes place each year, but this year\u2019s comes amid a bout of soul-searching in Australia over whether the country should tilt its security and diplomatic policy to be less aligned with the U.S. and take more account of China\u2019s rapid rise and challenge to U.S. primacy in the Indo-Pacific region.It also follows an inquiry Mr. Turnbull ordered into espionage and alleged influence-buying by wealthy Chinese in Australia after warnings from intelligence agencies and media reports of millions of dollars in foreign donations to political parties.This month, Mr. Turnbull warned Beijing against \u201ccoercive\u201d behavior and construction of artificial atolls in the South China Sea. Security experts widely interpreted the speech as a hardening of Canberra\u2019s foreign policy toward its biggest trade partner.Chinese investment in Australia rose 12% to 15.4 billion Australian dollars last year (US$11.7 billion), the highest level since the global financial crisis ended in 2008. Exports to China grew 8% to $81 billion Australian dollars last year, almost a third of Australia\u2019s total.Australia\u2019s recently retired head of the defense department, Dennis Richardson, urged the country on Monday to curb its trade reliance on China, saying that \u201cany business that relies so much on one customer ought to have a look at its business model\u201d.Asked which major power is more important to their nation, Australians were evenly split between Washington and Beijing, the survey found, with 45% saying the U.S. and 43% picking China.Recent calls from Pentagon officials and Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) urging Australia to join the U.S. in patrols to challenge Chinese muscle flexing in the South China Sea were supported by 68% of respondents. But 34% of survey respondents were in favor of using Australian military forces in any conflict over disputed territories between China and its neighbors.Michael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute, said the attitudes toward China in the survey were characterized by pragmatism, even though perceptions of China as a military threat had increased. Most Australians thought China had replaced Japan as their country\u2019s closest friend in Asia, while almost half, 46%, also thought Beijing would become a military risk in the next 20 years.The survey also showed that despite a surge in nationalism and protectionism across the West, underscored by the Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory and Britain\u2019s Brexit vote, Australians were supportive of trade liberalization, he said.Almost 80% of Australians thought globalization was \u201cmostly good\u201d and accepted the benefits of free trade, the survey found. That contrasts with Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on trade deals and his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the ambitious 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership.Write to Rob Taylor at rob.taylor@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 03:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-staunchest-ally-likes-uncle-sam-dislikes-donald-trump-1498031865", "news_title": "America\u2019s Staunchest Ally Likes Uncle Sam, Dislikes Donald Trump", "keywords": " austalia trump,australia trade, china australia, china trade,donald trump approval,economy, turnbull trump,political,general news,national,public security,international relations,politics,domestic politics,espionage,surveys,polls"}, {"content": "China has won a longed-for trophy with admission of its domestically-listed stocks to MSCI\u2019s global benchmarks. Don\u2019t hold your breath that it will lead to a more open market.MSCI said Tuesday it would add shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, or A shares, to its major indexes, after rejecting inclusion in the previous three years. For now, the move is mostly symbolic, because MSCI is only allowing 222 companies in initially: A-shares will only make up 0.7% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, with inclusion only happening in two phases beginning next year. Goldman Sachs estimates a total inflows of just $12 billion from international funds initially\u2014a drop in China\u2019s $7.8 trillion equity markets.Now that MSCI has made its long-awaited admission, the worry is that China may have lost a big incentive to further reform its financial markets.China is pretty good at showing sincerity regarding reform before big decisions like the MSCI inclusion. Take the addition of the yuan into the International Monetary Fund\u2019s elite basket of reserve currencies in late 2015. To persuade the IMF to give its currency this coveted status, China showed it was willing to let the yuan depreciate and move within a wider trading range the summer before.But when capital outflows from China subsequently became a big issue for Beijing, it backtracked on efforts to liberalize its capital account. Capital controls have tightened further in recent months, while the Chinese currency seems unable to break through a floor of 7 yuan to the dollar.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.In the same way, China has introduced several stock market reforms as it has pushed for MSCI inclusion, scrapping quotas on the number stocks foreign investors can buy via trading links between the mainland and Hong Kong, and cracking down on companies arbitrarily suspending trading in their shares. It has also loosened the requirement that it needs to preapprove any financial products that are tracking A shares.Some global investors on Wednesday said MSCI\u2019s inclusion for Chinese shares would enable them to press for more such reforms at both the market and corporate level in China. Still, the inclusion only brings a relative handful of Chinese companies into the MSCI orbit, compared with more than 3,000 stocks listed in China. The roughly 1.5% of Chinese stock markets foreigners currently own will barely rise.It\u2019s vital, then, that any further increase in the weighting of A-shares in MSCI indexes is matched by further strides in market reforms in China.

The Shanghai Composite Index closed up 0.5%, while its Shenzhen counterpart gained 0.4%.The tepid response was viewed in the market as a reflection of the relative caution apparent in MSCI\u2019s decision. After discussions with major fund managers including             BlackRock Inc.,       the index provider said it would admit roughly half the largest number of companies it had considered including in past years.MSCI estimates some $17 billion will flow into Chinese markets\u2014both from passive funds that automatically track its indexes and active fund managers\u2014when the country\u2019s stocks are included a year from now.

The move could change the way that global investors look at China, said       Chin-Ping Chia,        head of research for Asia-Pacific at MSCI.\u201cIt\u2019s about the opening of a new phase of emerging-market investing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe opening of the Great Wall, so to speak.\u201dIncluding Chinese stocks in MSCI benchmarks will have \u201cfar-reaching implications\u201d for global equity investors, said       Rakesh Patel,        head of equities for Asia-Pacific at             HSBC.       He said some $500 billion could flow into Chinese markets in time, as they become more accessible and companies such as MSCI and FTSE Russell give a full weighting to Chinese stocks in their indexes.The country\u2019s stock-market regulator, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said in a statement that the decision reflected confidence from global investors in the Chinese economy and financial markets.The regulator also pledged to further revamp its capital markets. \u201cThe Chinese capital market must welcome foreign investors more openly,\u201d it said.In the year since MSCI\u2018s most recent rejection of Chinese stocks\u2019 inclusion in its indexes, the country has further opened up the Shenzhen market to global investors via a trading link with Hong Kong. It has also overhauled the rules governing share suspensions, making it more difficult for companies to halt trading in their shares.One question for investors is whether having more shareholders from overseas will encourage greater transparency and better corporate governance at Chinese companies.\u201cNow that China\u2019s domestic stock market has become a member of the international family, it has become easier for us to have a dialogue with companies and regulators to express our views,\u201d said       Victoria Mio,        Hong Kong-based chief investment officer for China at asset manager Robeco.Following MSCI\u2019s decision, global investor attention will focus on improvements in the quality of management at Chinese companies, said       Kevin Anderson,        head of investments for Asia-Pacific at State Street Global Advisors.\u201cThere will now be a lens shone on Chinese companies, with an eye on improving shareholder value, corporate governance and returns from those companies,\u201d he said.Yet others were less upbeat. Chinese stock markets \u201cstill suffer from serious institutional shortcomings as well as heavy political influence,\u201d according to analysts at research firm Eurasia Group.Since China\u2019s market crashes in 2015 and early 2016, the presence of state-backed investment funds in the market has risen in importance. Local traders say such funds often step in to buy or sell shares during periods of market volatility.In addition, China\u2019s market regulator continues to exert strong control over the pace of initial public offerings. Despite recent revamps, the country\u2019s tight capital controls can still make it difficult for investors to move money across the border.The MSCI decision is unlikely to lead to huge inflows of capital from abroad until China makes further changes to the structure of its capital markets, said       Liu Weiming,        Beijing-based chief investment officer at Fuxi Investment Management Co.\u201cHas MSCI given China a chicken wing to help it fly higher or is it just chicken ribs that carry little meat or value? I think it\u2019s chicken ribs,\u201d he said. \u201dIf you don\u2019t make your home clean and tidy enough, how do you expect your guests to come for a visit?\u201d\u2014       Chao Deng       and Shen Hong contributed to this article.Correction  Kevin Anderson is head of investments for Asia-Pacific at State Street Global Advisors.

TSLA -0.91%       has parted ways with another senior leader on its self-driving technology team, adding more turmoil to a program that is under pressure to meet the grand ambitions of Chief Executive       Elon Musk.The Silicon Valley electric-car maker on Tuesday said       Chris Lattner,        the vice president of Autopilot software, has left the company about six months after Tesla hired him away from Apple Inc.\u201cChris just wasn\u2019t the right fit for Tesla, and we\u2019ve decided to make a change,\u201d Tesla said Tuesday.Mr. Lattner followed Tesla\u2019s statement with a posting on Twitter: \u201cTurns out that Tesla isn\u2019t a good fit for me after all. I\u2019m interested to hear about interesting roles for a seasoned engineering leader!\u201dMr. Lattner didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The program, under pressure from Mr. Musk to demonstrate a Tesla vehicle can drive itself by year\u2019s end, has grappled with an exodus of talent and questions about the safety of the technology. Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system, which can assist drivers with steering, breaking and changing lanes, sparked a safety debate after a Tesla driver in Florida died in a crash a year ago while using the semiautonomous system.U.S. regulators closed their investigation of the crash in January by concluding Autopilot didn\u2019t contain a safety defect.Mr. Lattner\u2019s hiring in January coincided with the departure of Autopilot director       Sterling Anderson,        a leader in developing the system. Tesla sued Mr. Anderson over his efforts to create a competing startup; the lawsuit was settled in April.In March,       David Nist\u00e9r       left his job as the vice president of Autopilot vision for chip maker             Nvidia Corp.On Tuesday, Tesla said it had elevated       Jim Keller,        vice president of Autopilot hardware, to also oversee Autopilot software. Mr. Keller joined Tesla in 2016 from chip maker             Advanced Micro Devices Inc.The company also said       Andrej Karpathy,        an expert in computer vision who worked recently as a research scientist at OpenAI\u2014a nonprofit co-founded by Mr. Musk\u2014would become director of AI and Autopilot vision.The team has an ambitious agenda. Even as Mr. Musk last year dealt with safety regulators examining Autopilot, he was pushing ahead with promises to make the system more robust.In October, he announced that vehicles coming off the assembly line were being equipped with the hardware need to make them fully self-driving once the software was ready\u2014and promised to demonstrate that ability by driving from Los Angeles to New York by the end of 2017.Amid the Autopilot drama, Tesla is on the eve of beginning production of the Model 3, its foray into less-expensive vehicles. The $35,000 car is supposed to help boost the company\u2019s production to 500,000 next year from about 84,000 last year.The hard-charging Mr. Musk has seen several executives leave in recent years, including the chief financial officer.None of the hurdles, however, seem to have damped enthusiasm for his vision among investors, who have sent the company\u2019s stock to record highs, pushing Tesla past General Motors Co. as the largest U.S. auto maker by market capitalization\u2014despite its having just a fraction of GM\u2019s sales and no history of annual profit.Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com", "news_time": "2017-06-21 00:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-replaces-self-driving-software-chief-1498012870", "news_title": "Tesla Replaces Chief of Self-Driving Software", "keywords": " automomous vehicle,autopilot, elon musk, self-driving car,tesla,tesla autopilot,Tesla,TSLA,Jim Keller,Elon Musk,Andrej Karpathy,Chris Lattner,David\u00a0Nist\u00e9r,Sterling Anderson,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,motor vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,autonomous driving technologies,automotive,technology"}, {"content": "SANDY SPRINGS, Ga.\u2014Republicans held on to a hotly contested U.S. House seat in Georgia on Tuesday, beating back an aggressive challenge that showed the Democrats\u2019 inability to turn opposition to       Donald Trump\u2019s       presidency into electoral gains.Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, beat Democrat       Jon Ossoff,        a onetime congressional aide, in the most expensive House race in history and the most significant test of the two parties\u2019 political strength since Mr. Trump\u2019s election.In nearly complete results, Ms. Handel had almost 53% of the vote to just over 47% for Mr. Ossoff, the Associated Press reported.In winning the seat, Republicans overcame a Democratic advantage in campaign spending and demonstrated that Mr. Trump retained political capital in the district. The president, Vice President       Mike Pence       and other party luminaries visited the Atlanta suburbs to support Ms. Handel\u2019s candidacy.The result was a big blow to Democrats, who were hungry for a victory to demonstrate that grass-roots, anti-Trump energy gives them a shot at taking control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats earlier this year lost two other contested House special elections, in Kansas and Montana.In a special election Tuesday in South Carolina, Republican Ralph Norman held the House seat vacated by       Mick Mulvaney,        Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, but by a far closer margin than expected. Mr. Norman defeated Democrat Archie Parnell, a former Goldman Sachs executive, by less than four percentage points. Mr. Mulvaney won the district by 20 points in November and Mr. Trump carried it by 18 points.The twin victories mean that Republicans are 4-for-4 in the House special elections that are being widely viewed for signals to each party\u2019s prospects next year in the battle for control of the House, which is now held by the Republicans. Georgia had been considered Democrats\u2019 best shot at a win.In her victory speech, Ms. Handel offered a \u201cspecial thanks to the president of the United States,\u201d who had come to the district for a fundraiser and sent supportive             Twitter                   messages in the closing days of the campaign. After her victory, Mr. Trump congratulated her in another tweet.In conceding, Mr. Ossoff said he didn\u2019t get the outcome he wanted but that his campaign had awakened a movement.\u201cWe showed the world that in places where no one thought it was even possible to fight, we could fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fight goes on.\u2019\u2019Mr. Ossoff\u2019s defeat will likely prompt soul-searching among Democrats about what it will take to flip Republican-held seats in the 2018 midterm fight for control of the House, given that such a vast effort in Georgia fell short. More than $31 million was poured into the Ossoff campaign by donors and outside groups, compared with more than $23 million spent by Ms. Handel\u2019s campaign and its allies.Still, the fact that Republicans had to work so hard to hold on to a historically conservative district sent a warning to GOP incumbents and candidates that they likely will have a tougher fight than usual next year, especially in suburbs like Georgia\u2019s Sixth District, where many residents are affluent and hold college degrees.Chip Lake, a Republican consultant in Georgia unaffiliated with the Handel campaign, said the Republican win means the party \u201cdodged a bullet.\u201dRepublicans should see the expensive race as \u201ca wake-up call to our base and our party,\u201d because the election in a traditionally Republican district shouldn\u2019t have been close, Mr. Lake said. \u201cI\u2019m glad we won, but we shouldn\u2019t have had to spend $20 million to $25 million to do it.\u201dBut all that money, and Ms. Handel\u2019s use of a tried-and-true strategy of linking Mr. Ossoff to national party figures such as House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, succeeded in waking up Republican voters who had been at risk of sitting on the sidelines. It showed that even in places that Mr. Trump carried only narrowly, GOP voters can unite in the face of a Democratic opponent. Turnout soared in the second round of voting compared with the primary in April, a sign that Republicans managed to match the energy of the Democratic base.Ed Painter, chairman of the GOP in Georgia\u2019s 12th Congressional District, said Ms. Handel won in part because she drew support from Republican voters who might have been slow to come around because they were alienated by Mr. Trump\u2019s election.Results for 2017 special elections for seats previously held by RepublicansRaces listed in chronological order; U.S. House races in boldRepublican margin in:2017 special electionPresidential race2016 general election", "news_time": "2017-06-21 00:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gops-karen-handel-beats-democrat-jon-ossoff-in-georgia-house-race-1498011241", "news_title": "GOP\u2019s Karen Handel Beats Democrat Jon Ossoff in Georgia", "keywords": " atlanta, democrats, donald trump, georgia, georgia special election, gop,jon ossoff,karen handel, republicans,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s       Jeff Bezos       is keeping startups and their investors on their toes.The e-commerce behemoth made moves in both grocery and apparel sales in five days, sparking uneasiness among companies in both sectors. Amazon said Tuesday it is launching a service that will allow Prime customers to try apparel before they buy it.The service, dubbed Prime Wardrobe, could make a dent in startups that wooed shoppers with clothing rentals and flexible shipping.The arena of fashion startups includes popular services like Stitch Fix Inc., which offers curated boxes of items to try, buy or return. It also includes rental clothing subscriptions, such as Le Tote Inc. and Rent the Runway Inc.Stitch Fix is backed by $42 million in funding and includes investors Benchmark and Lightspeed Ventures. It has been profitable since 2014, according to a spokeswoman.Rent the Runway has raised $190 million from investors including Technology Crossover Ventures and Bain Capital Ventures. Le Tote has raised more than $20 million from investors including Azure Capital Partners, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures.Amazon\u2019s new service is \u201cquite different\u201d from the business at Stitch Fix, according to the spokeswoman.\u201cOur clients love having their very own personal stylist who does the shopping for them,\u201d the spokeswoman said.Other direct-to-consumer online retailers don\u2019t charge customers for products for the first 30 days and offer free returns.With Amazon Prime Wardrobe, customers will be able to fill a box with three or more apparel items, try them on at home for up to seven days and ship back anything they don\u2019t want for free. They aren\u2019t charged until the seven-day trial period ends, and they get 20% off anything they keep.The new service is in beta and available for advance sign-ups.Amazon\u2019s service may overlap with Le Tote and Rent the Runway, which allow users to rent boxes of outfits for a monthly fee and buy any items they like.Rent the Runway Chief Executive Jennifer Hyman said the service could compliment or even benefit her company.\u201cIt puts people into the behavior of having a subscription to fashion,\u201d she said.She said consumers will buy basic pieces they wear again and again from Amazon while they may turn to Rent the Runway for trendy pieces they don\u2019t want to own.Le Tote Chief Executive       Rakesh       Tondon said his company will be insulated from the move.\u201cWe\u2019re saying don\u2019t buy, rent,\u201d       Mr. Tondon       said. \u201cThe value proposition is very different.\u201dHowever, Mr. Tondon said the majority of the company\u2019s customers end up purchasing an item from Le Tote every month.The move comes just days after Amazon sent shock waves through the food and meal delivery category with its acquisition of             Whole Foods.       That directly challenges venture-backed food delivery service Instacart.Amazon has quietly been raising its profile as a destination for apparel, especially among millennial shoppers.The company owned the largest share of online apparel sales among millennials in 2016, according to data firm Slice Intelligence. It held 16.6% of online clothing sales among millennials, ahead of Nordstrom, Old Navy and J. Crew. Stitch Fix ranked eighth, with 3.2% of sales.Venture capitalists said Amazon\u2019s move could create waves for other online apparel sellers.Shasta Ventures Managing Partner Tod Francis said it\u2019s a smart move on the company\u2019s part because it addresses the anxiety of getting a good fit with clothes bought online\u2014a factor he thinks has held back online clothing sales.\u201cThis will impact other players in the space by setting a new standard of service,\u201d       Mr. Francis       said.Maveron LLC General       Partner Rebecca Kaden       cautioned that startups \u201ccan never underestimate\u201d Amazon.However, she says, the company hasn\u2019t nailed fashion yet. She said it will be challenging for Amazon to address the emotional tie young consumers have with the brands they buy.\u201cWhen I say I\u2019m the kind of person who shops at Warby Parker, you know something about me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I say I\u2019m the kind of person who shops at Amazon, you really don\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-21 00:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-next-battleground-is-the-fitting-room-1498011759", "news_title": "Amazon\u2019s Next Battleground Is the Fitting Room", "keywords": "Amazon.com,AMZN,Stitch Fix,Technology Crossover Ventures,Instacart,Warby Parker,Maveron,Old Navy,Mr. Francis,Mr. Tondon,Partner Rebecca Kaden,Rakesh,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,fashion,living,lifestyle,analyses,commentaries,opinions,retail,wholesale,etailing,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,e-commerce,financial services,internet,online,investing,securities,technology,venture capital"}]
