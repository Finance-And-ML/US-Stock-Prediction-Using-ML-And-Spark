A second person corroborated the investigation.No further details of the investigation were given, the people said.State media announced Mr. Sun\u2019s removal Saturday but didn\u2019t provide a reason or mention an investigation. Replacing Mr. Sun as Chongqing\u2019s party secretary is Chen Min\u2019er, who was party chief for the southern province of Guizhou, state media reported.Calls to the Communist Party\u2019s personnel and investigative agencies, as well as to the Chongqing government, rang unanswered after business hours. Mr. Sun couldn\u2019t be reached for comment; he had been recalled to Beijing ahead of Saturday\u2019s meeting, one of the people said.The removal of Mr. Sun comes as the party gears up for a pivotal congress this fall, providing Mr. Xi a chance to pack top leadership bodies with allies.Mr. Xi, who appears assured of gaining a second five-year term as party general secretary at the congress, is also trying to sideline rivals, party insiders and analysts said.Some party insiders have said Mr. Xi may also be trying to block promotion of anyone who could be seen as a potential successor\u2014a move that would enhance his authority and boost his chances of remaining in office after his second term expires in 2022.Mr. Sun is a member of the party\u2019s Politburo\u2014its top 25 officials\u2014and had been regarded by party insiders and analysts as a strong contender for promotion to the Politburo Standing Committee, the party\u2019s top decision-making body, or even as a possible successor to Mr. Xi.Mr. Sun is one of two current Politburo members who are in their 50s, making them young enough to be considered candidates for helming China\u2019s next generation of leaders after Mr. Xi. The other is       Hu Chunhua,        party chief of the affluent southeastern province of Guangdong.The official replacing Mr. Sun in Chongqing, Mr. Chen, is one of Mr. Xi\u2019s allies, having worked with the current Chinese leader in the eastern province of Zhejiang, where Mr. Xi was party chief from 2002 to 2007.Mr. Chen\u2019s new post is likely to assure him promotion to the Politburo. The party secretary of Chongqing, an industrial and commercial hub astride the Yangtze River, customarily sits on the Politburo. Mr. Chen is currently a part of the roughly 370-member Central Committee, one tier below the Politburo.Zhao Leji,        chief of the party\u2019s personnel department, announced the decision to replace Mr. Sun at the Saturday meeting. Mr. Zhao told the officials that Mr. Sun was being questioned by the party, without elaborating, one of the people familiar with matter said, adding that Mr. Chen, the new Chongqing party chief, was present at this meeting.According to a state-media report, Mr. Chen told attendees that \u201cfirmly protecting General Secretary Xi Jinping\u2019s core status\u201d should be their top political priority.Chongqing was also at the center of political intrigue ahead of the last party congress in 2012. Bo Xilai, then Chongqing party chief, made a national name for himself promoting Maoist culture, targeting organized crime and spending heavily to build up the city.His ambitions for high office were quashed by scandal, after his wife was implicated in the murder of a British businessman. Mr. Bo was subsequently jailed for corruption and abuse of power; his wife, Gu Kailai, is serving a de facto life sentence for the murder.Mr. Sun, named Chongqing party chief in late 2012, was tasked with cleaning up Mr. Bo\u2019s legacy. His efforts were recently deemed inadequate by the party\u2019s disciplinary agency, which in February criticized Chongqing authorities for failing to eradicate Mr. Bo\u2019s \u201clingering pernicious influence\u201d and curb corruption in local bureaucracy and business.Write to Chun Han Wong at chunhan.wong@wsj.com and Lingling Wei at lingling.wei@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Beijing Probes Top Official.'", "news_time": "2017-07-16 23:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/possible-successor-to-chinas-xi-jinping-is-dismissed-from-party-post-1500131243", "news_title": "China Launches Probe Into Possible Xi Jinping Competitor", "keywords": "china government,china politics,chongqing party chief,communist party,politburo,who will succeed xi jinping,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "A flash flood in Arizona killed at least nine people on Saturday, with authorities saying search operations were continuing for one missing person.The flood hit a popular recreation area, the Cold Springs Swimming Hole in the Tonto National Forest, situated north of the town of Payson, Ariz. and about 90 miles north of Phoenix.The Gila County Sheriff\u2019s Office said it responded to an emergency call around 3:19 p.m. Saturday.\u201cMy deepest prayers go out for all those lost in yesterday\u2019s flooding, for their families, and for the entire community,\u201d Arizona Gov.

He was 89.Mr. Landau died Saturday of unexpected complications during a short stay at UCLA Medical Center, his publicist       Dick Guttman       said.\u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d which also starred Mr. Landau\u2019s wife,       Barbara Bain,        became an immediate hit upon its debut in 1966. It remained on the air until 1973, but Mr. Landau and Ms. Bain left at the end of the show\u2019s third season amid a financial dispute with the producers. They starred in the British-made sci-fi series \u201cSpace: 1999\u201d from 1975 to 1977.Mr. Landau was offered the role of Mr. Spock on \u201cStar Trek\u201d but turned it down.\u201cA character without emotions would have driven me crazy; I would have had to be lobotomized,\u201d he explained in 2001. Instead, he chose \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d and       Leonard Nimoy       went on to everlasting fame as the pointy-eared Starship Enterprise science officer.Mr. Nimoy later replaced Mr. Landau on \u201cMission: Impossible.\u201dAfter a brief but impressive Broadway career, Mr. Landau had made an auspicious film debut in the late 1950s, playing a soldier in \u201cPork Chop Hill\u201d and a villain in the       Alfred Hitchcock       classic \u201cNorth By Northwest.\u201dHe enjoyed far less success after \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d however, finding he had been typecast as       Rollin Hand,        the top-secret mission team\u2019s disguise wizard. His film career languished for more than a decade, reaching its nadir with his appearance in the 1981 TV movie \u201cThe Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan\u2019s Island.\u201dHe began to find redemption with a sympathetic role in \u201cTucker: The Man and his Dream,\u201d the 1988       Francis Ford Coppola       film that garnered Mr. Landau his first Oscar nomination.He was nominated again the next year for his turn as the adulterous husband in       Woody Allen\u2019s       \u201cCrimes and Misdemeanors.\u201dHis third nomination was for \u201cEd Wood,\u201d director       Tim Burton\u2019s       affectionate tribute to a man widely viewed as the worst Hollywood filmmaker of all time.\u201cThere was a 10-year period when everything I did was bad. I\u2019d like to go back and turn all those films into guitar picks,\u201d Mr. Landau said after accepting his Oscar.In \u201cEd Wood,\u201d he portrayed Lugosi during his final years, when the Hungarian-born actor who had become famous as Count Dracula was ill, addicted to drugs and forced to make films with Ed Wood just to pay his bills. A gifted mimic trained in method acting, Mr. Landau thoroughly researched the role.\u201cI watched about 35 Lugosi movies, including ones that were worse than anything Ed Wood ever made,\u201d he recalled in 2001. \u201cDespite the trash, he had a certain dignity about him, whatever the role.\u201dSo did the New York-born Mr. Landau, who had studied drawing at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and worked for a time as a New York Daily News cartoonist before switching careers at age 22.He had dabbled in acting before the switch, making his stage debut in 1951 at a Maine summer theater in \u201cDetective Story\u201d and off-Broadway in \u201cFirst Love.\u201dIn 1955, he was among hundreds who applied to study at the prestigious Actors Studio and one of only two selected.

Their assessment: slow, modestly improved access in some sectors, while lingering obstacles in others will continue to stymie foreign firms for years, even as specific targeted barriers have been removed.\u201cThey\u2019ve delivered on the promises by the date they\u2019ve been required, but they could do more,\u201d said       Jake Parker,        vice president for the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents American companies in China and has been monitoring the agreements. While the changes \u201cindicate from the Chinese perspective that their market is open,\u201d Mr. Parker said, \u201cwhether foreign companies can actually operate there is still unclear\u201d in some industries.The success of those market-opening measures will be on the table when top economic officials from the two countries meet Wednesday to discuss trade and investment issues. Officials from both governments insist the pact has been successful.\u201cWe hope to report further progress on\u2026deliverables next week,\u201d a Commerce Department spokesman said Thursday, referring to actions taken under the May agreement.\u201cA number of \u2018early harvests\u2019 have been reaped,\u201d a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said Friday, adding: \u201cChina\u2019s door to the world\u2026will be opened wider.\u201dThe May announcement was portrayed as an early down payment on a general April agreement between President       Donald Trump       and Chinese President       Xi Jinping       to make progress toward reducing the $347 billion bilateral trade imbalance that Mr. Trump regularly complains about.In return for China\u2019s promises, the U.S. offered a couple of market-opening gestures as well and, in compliance with the pact, has issued rules allowing previously blocked Chinese cooked-poultry imports.The two presidents gave themselves 100 days to come up with a comprehensive plan. More commitments are expected at this week\u2019s meetings, scheduled to observe the 100-day mark of the new U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue.Those discussions are expected to address American grievances over Chinese agricultural subsidies, steel overcapacity and government data-sharing requirements, among others. Mr. Trump may ratchet up his demands beyond those made in the spring, when he said he would cut China slack on trade in exchange for help curbing North Korea\u2019s nuclear program\u2014a deal the president said hasn\u2019t worked out.But difficulty showing quick, significant progress on even the early items targeted as low-hanging fruit indicates bigger challenges ahead in reshaping U.S.-China economic relations.In the May agreement, the Trump administration had marked five sectors\u2014three in finance, two in agriculture\u2014where U.S. firms had long been frustrated by perceived Chinese regulatory barriers.Chinese agencies have made the specific changes promised in the written agreement. One resulted in clear, complete compliance: Beijing granted licenses promised to             Citigroup Inc.       and             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. to expand their bond-market activities in China.In the other four, market gains seem limited or uncertain, business officials say.Consider the yearslong battle by             Visa Inc.       and             Mastercard Inc.       to get banks in China to distribute credit cards that run on their networks to Chinese consumers. China committed in May to issue any further necessary guidelines allowing U.S. firms to begin the licensing process, a crucial step that had long been stalled. The Chinese fulfilled that commitment on June 30. But while that step was aimed at leading \u201cto full and prompt market access,\u201d according to a U.S. government press release, industry officials say it hasn\u2019t.\u201cAll this does is allow companies to submit an application; it doesn\u2019t mean that a foreign card company can begin operating in the market,\u201d said Mr. Parker, who believes it still will be years before Chinese banks distribute many Visa or Mastercard branded cards that run on those networks in China. Among other barriers, he said, the new rules require firms to submit to a national security review, without laying out the details of that process, and require foreign firms to build new data centers in China.Visa and Mastercard spokespeople said they are reviewing the guidelines, without offering a timetable for submitting applications.A similar partial victory has been handed Moody\u2019s Investors Service,             S&P Global Inc.,       and Fitch Ratings over Beijing\u2019s commitment to allow wholly owned financial-services firms in China to provide credit-rating services.The Chinese government issued new rules effective July 10 removing foreign-ownership restrictions for credit-ratings services. Industry officials say that is a step forward, but uncertainty remains over the process and timing for receiving the licenses still required to issue domestic ratings.\u201cAs a general matter we are encouraged by the policies of the Chinese government,\u201d Moody\u2019s said, while S&P said it was still reviewing the new rules. Fitch declined to comment.Uncertainty over approval processes is also a concern for American seed companies. In May, China promised by mid-July to grant approval for eight stalled applications for genetically modified crops for companies including             Dow Chemical Co.       and             Monsanto Co.      , or at least offer a clear road map for how they could succeed.Two approvals were granted in June, to Dow and Monsanto, and trade groups expect a couple more this week. But industry officials remain frustrated by the licenses that remain stuck and by the continued uncertainty over the requirements and timetable for the process. And they say they are still waiting for broader reforms showing that any future applications would be handled more transparently.\u201cAll eight [approvals] are necessary to showcase that this was a success,\u201d said       Matthew O\u2019Mara       of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a trade group representing seed makers.Monsanto and Dow spokeswomen said they were pleased their products had received approvals and looked forward to more.One triumph touted by the Trump administration has been the late-June opening of China\u2019s beef market, shut to U.S. meatpackers since a 2003 mad-cow scare. But the strictness of China\u2019s standards, which bar growth-promoting hormones common in the U.S. and require detailed records for each animal slaughtered, mean China likely will remain for now a niche market for the American beef industry.The strings attached \u201climit the number of cattle in the U.S. that qualify,\u201d said       Marcel Smits,        chief financial officer for Cargill Inc., the No. 3 U.S. beef producer. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to move the needle in the short term.\u201dWrite to Jacob M.

But in one respect, it bears little resemblance to a boomtown: It hasn\u2019t gained a single housing unit in 15 years.The ZIP Code encompassing this vibrant Los Angeles precinct is the toughest place in America to build housing, according to an analysis of housing data conducted for The Wall Street Journal by Issi Romem, chief economist at BuildZoom, a website for contractors.In all, the area, which encompasses Venice Beach, had about 700 fewer housing units in 2015 than in 2000, as apartment development stalled and wealthy homeowners gobbled up adjacent properties and leveled them. Home prices in the ZIP Code have more than tripled in those 15 years, rising 246% compared with the national average of 52% in the period, according to Mr. Romem\u2019s analysis.Venice Beach is an extreme example of what has been happening in wealthy urban enclaves across the U.S. that have been resisting new housing development in recent years.Apartment developers have stepped up production focused largely on the inner cores of big U.S. cities, where millennials are flocking for high-paying jobs and easy commutes, and where development is often welcomed. Meanwhile, surrounding low-rise neighborhoods\u2014many filled with older structures and historical character\u2014are keeping developers out.Residents of these older urban neighborhoods generally have resisted newcomers, complaining about congestion on roads and public transportation and seeking to preserve architecture, sunlight and views.Yet if U.S. cities want to ease housing-price pressures, Mr. Romem said, they will have to relax zoning restrictions and allow tall new buildings across the majority of neighborhoods, not just in concentrated downtown areas.\u201cIf you want to stunt this housing affordability crisis, you need to rewrite the rules,\u201d Mr. Romem said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t open the floodgates, things won\u2019t improve.\u201dAfter Venice Beach, the second most difficult place to build in the U.S., according to Mr. Romem\u2019s analysis, was Prospect-Lefferts Gardens in Brooklyn, a park-side section of limestone row houses that is popular with young families priced out of other Brooklyn neighborhoods. The third-toughest place to build was the Fishtown section of Philadelphia, a city few think of as hostile to development.Fishtown, with a gritty waterfront and working-class roots, has become an artsy hub as young people move in. But getting new projects off the ground here is difficult, developers say. Labor costs are nearly in line with those of New York City, but rents and condo prices, despite recent gains, are nowhere close.A proposal to build 23 studio and one-bedroom apartments there, in a former church, has been in the works for two years facing opponents who want to preserve an iconic building. One of the developers, Michael Wachs, managing principal at Linden Lane Capital Partners, said if his group gives up, another developer could come in and build townhomes on the site. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to save the building,\u201d he said, while his opponents \u201care trying to bring back a way of life that\u2019s not there.\u201dOpponents of the project say that the church is one of the most beautiful buildings in the neighborhood and a link to its history and should be preserved in full.In Venice Beach, the total number of housing units permitted now under zoning rules is half the number permitted in the late 1950s, according to an analysis by Dario Alvarez, president of community planning firm Pacific Urbanism. Developers said even projects that require only minimal changes to the rules encounter such stiff community opposition they often lose momentum and die.Opponents \u201cobject all the way through and then they\u2019ll take every appeal that they can,\u201d said Frank Murphy, who has been a developer in the area for 40 years. \u201cEven though they may lose on appeal, by that time your developers just get dragged out so long they give up.\u201dThose opposed to new development say it is often aimed at the very wealthy or very poor and doesn\u2019t seem to benefit current residents of what traditionally have been predominantly middle-class neighborhoods. New buildings may not fit with the character or scale of the neighborhood, and too often cities don\u2019t have a plan for the additional strains on transportation and parking that result, they say.The Venice Beach population is shrinking even as the local economy has boomed. The neighborhood had about 27,000 residents in 2015, about 3,800 fewer than in 2000, according to U.S. Census data. At the same time, the ZIP Code has added 4,000 new jobs, according to Jed Kolko, chief economist at employment website Indeed.A proposal to build what developers say is the neighborhood\u2019s first 100% affordable housing project in 15 years is meeting stiff opposition. Becky Dennison, executive director of the project, Venice Community Housing, said land prices in the neighborhood have risen such that it is virtually impossible to build affordable housing there.Her project, a couple of blocks off the beach, represents an unusual opportunity, she said, because it sits on city-owned land. It will be aimed at the area\u2019s large homeless population, with subsidies to ensure that tenants would pay no more than 30% of their incomes on rent.Ms. Dennison said her group could build 260 units on the site but has voluntarily scaled it back to 140 apartments after encountering opposition from local residents. \u201cNot having done [new affordable development] in so long adds to that fear of the unknown,\u201d she said.Opponents said they plan to fight the project to the end. \u201cThey\u2019re planning a structure of mind-boggling proportions,\u201d said Zelda Lambrecht, a local homeowner and founding member of Venice Vision, a neighborhood advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s like living next door to Disneyland.\u201dOther Venice Beach residents lament that rising real-estate prices and rental rates have made it difficult for residents to stay. Victoria Taylor, owner of a Moroccan textile and d\u00e9cor shop in the Mar Vista section who has lived in Venice Beach since 1990, said she is moving to Austin, Texas. She earns a six-figure income, she said, but could never afford to buy a house in Venice Beach.\u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get a two-bedroom house here for under $1 million. It\u2019s just not worth it for me when I can get something bigger for less somewhere else.\u201d\u2014Covey Son contributed to this article.Write to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Housing Stalls in Urban Hot Spots.'", "news_time": "2017-07-16 20:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venice-beach-is-a-hot-place-to-live-so-why-is-its-housing-supply-shrinking-1500206400", "news_title": "Venice Beach Is a Hot Place to Live,\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tSo Why Is Its Housing Supply Shrinking?

Both Republicans and Democrats in the House proposed capping transportation bonds at $700 million for the current fiscal year, well below the $1.3 billion the Connecticut Transportation Department wanted.James Redeker,        commissioner of the Transportation Department, said a $700 million cap on new bonds could result in delays for several federally funded projects, and others would be canceled.\u201cWe have major, significant projects that need to get done,\u201d Mr. Redeker said. \u201cIf we lose that momentum then we start jeopardizing the state of good repair and our ability to maintain our system.\u201dConnecticut\u2019s transportation options are already looking bleak. Its special transportation fund, which pays for debt service on transportation-related bonds and operations for the Transportation Department, is projected to be insolvent in three years, according to Gov.       Dannel Malloy\u2019s       budget office.Budget cuts proposed by House Democrats and Republicans could speed up that insolvency, industry experts said.\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time here in Connecticut,\u201d said       Karen Burnaska,        coordinator of Transit for Connecticut, a group that wants more investment in transit service. \u201cWe are worried about what the short-term revenue will be to maintain existing services and to continue the investment in capital projects.\u201dThe aging condition of the state\u2019s transportation system comes at a price. The state estimates that drivers spend up to 40 hours a year stuck in traffic at the cost of $1.6 billion in lost time and fuel, and $2.6 billion in operating and fuel costs and accidents.Businesses have pushed for highway congestion relief, said       Eric Gjede,        counsel with the Connecticut Business & Industry Association. \u201cThat\u2019s been identified as the number one issue,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, the Connecticut Transportation Department\u2019s four-year plan to complete 280 federally funded projects could be jeopardized. Among those projects are replacing tracks on Metro-North Railroad\u2019s New Haven line, rehabbing highway bridges across the state, and making upgrades to a traffic-clogged stretch of Interstate 95 between Greenwich and Stamford.The state proposal, which still needs to be submitted for approval by the federal government, relies on state and local municipalities to chip in $646.8 million to the overall cost. The federal government will pay about $3 billion.Democrats in the Connecticut House of Representatives, who are a majority in that chamber, have proposed using sales-tax revenue that is scheduled to fund transportation expenses to help balance the overall budget. House Republicans are calling for similar cuts.If enacted, those diversions would accelerate the insolvency of the state\u2019s transportation fund, said       Donald Shubert,        president of the Connecticut Construction Industries Association.\u201cWe are going to be lucky if we can make it through the next couple of years\u201d even if we avoid spending reductions, Mr. Shubert said. \u201cThis is no time to be cutting transportation.\u201dSpeaker of the House       Joe Aresimowicz       said investment in transportation infrastructure is one of his priorities, but the state needs a new way to pay for it.\u201cMaintaining and updating our outdated transportation infrastructure is critical to our future,\u201d said Mr. Aresimowicz. He supports bringing back highway tolls to raise revenue, an idea widely opposed by Republicans and some Democrats.Lyle Wray,        executive director for the Capitol Region Council of Governments, a group that represents Hartford and surrounding communities, said putting off transportation spending hurts the state\u2019s long-term competitiveness.\u201cInvesting in those opportunities attracts millennials and next-generation skill people and helps corporations decide to stay here,\u201d Mr. Wray said. \u201cLook around the country: The       Denvers       and Salt Lakes and the Seattles and Portlands are all investing heavily in transit, and they attracting millennials.

Mark Dayton just wanted to catch some bass on a popular Minnesota lake. But lakefront residents aboard a flotilla of some 40 vessels decided to catch the governor.As Mr. Dayton dropped anchor July 8 on Mille Lacs Lake\u2014a more than 200-square-mile body of water about 100 miles north of the Twin Cities\u2014the small armada encircled him for roughly an hour, waving signs protesting a new ban on fishing walleye, Minnesota\u2019s state fish. When he sailed out of the swirling fleet, they followed his boat to shore blasting patriotic songs like       Lee Greenwood\u2019s       \u201cGod Bless the USA.\u201dThe state\u2019s Department of Natural Resources says the ban will preserve the walleye and ensure it remains fishable for future generations, but this generation\u2019s lakefront business owners are furious.\u201cWalleye fishing is a Minnesota tradition,\u201d said       Linda Eno,        who has operated the lakefront Twin Pines Resort for 23 years and was one of the protest\u2019s organizers. Ms. Eno said business at her resort has fallen 60% over the past decade.The governor was to discuss the bans with the lakefront community later that same day, but cancelled the meeting after the waterborne demonstration. He since announced he will reschedule the talks, but a spokesman said no date has been set.\u201cIt\u2019s been a very tough time for people. I recognize that,\u201d the governor told reporters after he left the boat. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very, very hard time.\u201dThe standoff on the water highlights the importance of the more than $54 billion outdoor recreation market across hundreds of towns in the upper Midwest, which count on a steady stream of visitors who fish, hunt and cross country ski, depending on the season.A bad year for snow or poor fishing conditions can spell the difference between profit and loss for an entire year for many businesses.The walleye bans on Mille Lacs cover three prime fishing weeks this month and most of September and November. And even when walleye fishing is allowed, the tasty fish must be released back into the water.Locals claim increasingly harsh restrictions have taken their toll on the community, shuttering up to 50 businesses.Terry Thurmer,        who has owned Terry\u2019s Boat Harbor Marina for 28 years, said the catch-and-release provision means his charter boat business could lose up to 95% of its yearly profit.\u201cIt\u2019s just awful,\u201d Mr. Thurmer said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the state should have a right to control people\u2019s lives, but that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201dChris Niskanen,        a spokesman for the natural resources department, said it has tightened regulations on walleye fishing because the population hasn\u2019t been reproducing at sufficient rates. Officials speculate it is because newer generations of fish are having trouble reaching sexual maturity. The state co-manages the walleye allocation with eight Chippewa Native American bands.Paul Venturelli,        a fisheries professor at the University of Minnesota, said there are similar situations in Wisconsin and the lakes of Canada, where bass are expanding northward into lakes they never occupied.\u201cI don\u2019t think those large [walleye] quotas are coming back,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that Mille Lacs is trending toward a new normal.\u201dA possible silver lining is the emergence of Mille Lacs as a premier destination for bass fishing.Bassmaster Magazine ranked Mille Lacs the top bass fishery in the nation last month. Milles Lacs hosted the annual Toyota Bassmaster Angler of the Year Championship in September, and Bassmaster is planning to bring the tournament back to the lake this fall.But locals like Ms. Eno are doubtful that a heightened bass fishing presence will compensate for the temporary loss of the walleye. \u201cThe bottom line is there\u2019s not enough bass people to fill in the void of walleye fishermen,\u201d Ms. Eno said.There are, at least, a few more bass in Mille Lacs than there would have been without the demonstration. Mr. Dayton told reporters he didn\u2019t manage to catch any fish during his outing.Write to Quint Forgey at quint.forgey@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Fishing Ban Angers Tourism Industry.'", "news_time": "2017-07-16 19:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fishing-ban-angers-minnesota-tourism-industry-1500249567", "news_title": "Fishing Ban Angers Minnesota Tourism Industry", "keywords": "fishing,fishing ban,mark dayton,minnesota,natural resources,tourism,tourists,wildlife agency,Department of Natural Resources,angling,sports,routine general news,agriculture,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "NEW YORK\u2014      George Romero,        whose classic \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d and other horror films turned zombie movies into social commentaries and who saw his flesh-devouring undead spawn countless imitators, remakes and homages, has died. He was 77.Mr. Romero died Sunday following a battle with lung cancer, said his family in a statement provided by his manager       Chris Roe.       Mr. Romero\u2019s family said he died while listening to the score of \u201cThe Quiet Man,\u201d one of his favorite films to watch, with his wife,       Suzanne Desrocher,        and daughter, Tina Romero, by his side.Mr. Romero is credited with reinventing the movie zombie with his directorial debut, the 1968 cult classic \u201cNight of the Living Dead.\u201dThe movie set the rules imitators lived by: Zombies move slowly, lust for human flesh and can only be killed when shot in the head. If a zombie bites a human, the person dies and returns as a zombie.Mr. Romero\u2019s zombies, however, were always more than mere cannibals; they were metaphors for conformity, racism, mall culture, militarism, class differences and other social ills.\u201cThe zombies, they could be anything,\u201d Mr. Romero said in 2008. \u201cThey could be an avalanche, they could be a hurricane. It\u2019s a disaster out there. The stories are about how people fail to respond in the proper way. They fail to address it. They keep trying to stick where they are, instead of recognizing maybe this is too big for us to try to maintain. That\u2019s the part of it that I\u2019ve always enjoyed.\u201d\u201cNight of the Living Dead,\u201d made for about $100,000, featured flesh-hungry ghouls trying to feast on humans holed up in a Pennsylvania house. In 1999, the Library of Congress inducted the black-and-white masterpiece into the National Registry of Films.Many considered the film to be a critique on racism in America. The sole black character survives the zombies, but he is fatally shot by rescuers.Ten years after \u201cNight of the Living Dead,\u201d Mr. Romero made \u201cDawn of the Dead,\u201d where human survivors take refuge from the undead in a mall and then turn on each other as the zombies stumble around the shopping complex.Film critic Roger Ebert called it \u201cone of the best horror films ever made\u2014and, as an inescapable result, one of the most horrifying. It is gruesome, sickening, disgusting, violent, brutal and appalling. It is also\u2026brilliantly crafted, funny, droll, and savagely merciless in its satiric view of the American consumer society.\u201dMr. Romero had a sometimes combative relationship with the genre he helped create. He called \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d a \u201csoap opera\u201d and said big-budget films like \u201cWorld War Z\u201d made modest zombie films impossible.The third in the Romero\u2019s zombie series, 1985\u2019s \u201cDay of the Dead,\u201d was a critical and commercial failure. There wouldn\u2019t be another \u201cDead\u201d film for two decades.\u201cLand of the Dead\u201d in 2005 was the most star-packed of the bunch\u2014the cast included Dennis Hooper, John Leguizamo, Asia Argento and Simon Baker. Two years later came \u201cDiary of the Dead,\u201d another box-office failure.There were other movies interspersed with the \u201cDead\u201d films, including \u201cThe Crazies\u201d (1973), \u201cMartin\u201d (1977), \u201cCreepshow\u201d (1982), \u201cMonkey Shines\u201d (1988) and \u201cThe Dark Half\u201d (1993).

Some were moderately successful, others box-office flops.George Andrew Romero was born on Feb. 4, 1940, in New York City. He grew up in the Bronx, and he was a fan of horror comics and movies in the pre-VCR era.His favorite film was Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger\u2019s \u201cThe Tales of Hoffman,\u201d based on Jacques Offenbach\u2019s opera. It was, he once wrote, \u201cthe one movie that made me want to make movies.\u201dHe spoke fondly of traveling to Manhattan to rent a 16mm version of the film from a distribution house. When the film was unavailable, Mr. Romero said, it was because another \u201ckid\u201d had rented it\u2014Martin Scorsese.Mr. Romero graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh in 1960.

But\u00a0Senate leaders announced a delay after Sen. John McCain said he would recover in Arizona from surgery removing a blood clot above his left eye, leaving supporters short of the votes needed to move ahead with the bill.The delay prolongs the uncertainty over the bill\u2019s prospects. GOP leaders have pursued a fast-paced timeline, as health-policy changes are often controversial. Sen.       John Cornyn,        a member of Senate GOP leadership, told reporters last month that passing the bill\u00a0is \u201cnot going to get any easier\u201d with time. Another GOP senator,       Lindsey Graham       of South Carolina, said the bill\u00a0\u201cis not like fine wine; it doesn\u2019t get better with age.\u201dMeantime, insurance companies, state governors and congressional critics continued to line up against the bill, with their objections running the ideological gamut. Governors, including some Republicans, have said they are concerned about its proposed cuts to the growth of Medicaid spending, while two top insurance industry groups objected to a change to the GOP bill proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas as \u201cunworkable.\u201dSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who can\u2019t afford more than two defections among the 52 GOP senators, has been balancing demands by more-centrist lawmakers for additional money for Medicaid and consumer subsidies with a push by conservatives to pare back requirements on insurers in order to lower premiums for younger, healthier people.One centrist and one conservative GOP senator who have bucked their party before,       Susan Collins       of Maine and       Rand Paul       of Kentucky, have said they can\u2019t support the bill, for different reasons. But others have yet to commit, and one more defection would derail the legislation.\u00a0Mr. McCain\u2019s absence means GOP leaders are short of the votes this week for a procedural motion to consider the bill.Ms. Collins, speaking\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0on ABC, said that eight to 10 Republicans had \u201cdeep concerns\u201d about the bill, even after a\u00a0new version was unveiled last week\u00a0to address issues raised by some GOP senators.\u00a0\u201cI think it would be extremely close,\u201d she said when asked whether Mr. McConnell had the votes for passage.Senate GOP leaders, spurred on by the White House, had been building toward a deadline of this week that had been intended to isolate and spotlight holdouts, warning them that they would pay a price for bucking their party and undermining its collective legislative goal of the past seven years. They have emphasized insurance-market woes under the ACA in some states as proof of the urgency of the cause.Mr. McConnell had hoped to finish the health debate this week so the Senate could turn to the annual defense-policy bill, confirmation of more of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees and raising the debt limit before adjourning in mid-August.The McCain absence gives Mr. McConnell and the White House a chance to continue working on holdout senators without having to back down from a vote this week. But it also creates a window for the 2010 health law\u2019s supporters to continue a fight they believe is more likely to be successful the longer they wage it.\u201cA key factor is time: The longer the bill languishes, the less likely it will pass,\u201d said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. \u201cAnd there won\u2019t be much time left after Labor Day, as Congress shifts its focus to budget and tax issues. So, while McCain\u2019s absence complicates the health debate, it already was in deep trouble, even when he was healthy.\u201dPrime targets for both sides are the remaining senators who had opposed an earlier version of the Senate\u00a0bill but haven\u2019t taken a public stance on its latest iteration. Sen. Dean Heller (R., Nev.), up for re-election next year, is likely\u00a0under the most pressure, due in part to concerns about the bill from the GOP governor of his state. Other\u00a0Republicans from states that expanded Medicaid, including Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia, will be in the limelight this week.The extra time also allows for more scrutiny of a measure from Mr. Cruz\u00a0that would allow insurers to offer cheaper plans\u00a0with less comprehensive coverage than required under the ACA, if they also offer plans\u00a0that meet ACA coverage requirements. The proposal has alarmed insurers and centrist\u00a0Republicans who say it would cause premiums to surge for sicker people, who would\u00a0more likely buy more-comprehensive plans without the costs being\u00a0offset by policies that younger and healthier people buy.Senate leaders said they are confident they could hold the procedural vote to advance the bill as soon as Mr. McCain was back in the Senate.\u00a0The White House declined to comment at length on the setback\u00a0Sunday. \u201cWe wish Sen. McCain a speedy recovery,\u201d said spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9.The Trump administration has previously said a quick timeline on a health vote was best, particularly as Democrats and liberal organizers have stepped up their advocacy of preserving the ACA, which they see as former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       signature domestic achievement.\u201cThe left, I think, has been more organized in their messaging on this than collectively Republicans have as far as advocating for the benefits of the bill,\u201d said Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, last week.The difficulty for many Republicans is that supporting the bill or opposing it both carry political risk. On the one hand, the party has for years vowed a full repeal of the ACA, known as Obamacare. \u201cI think not being able to deliver on that promise would do serious and long-lasting damage to the credibility of Republicans,\u201d Mr. Cruz said in an interview.Others are weighing the fallout over health policy and how its changes would affect some states, particularly rural ones. \u201cThis bill would make sweeping and deep cuts to the Medicaid program.\u2026It would also jeopardize the very existence of our rural hospitals and our nursing homes,\u201d Ms. Collins said on ABC. Conservative lawmakers say the financing for Medicaid as now configured is unsustainable.Rep. Mark Amodei, a Republican representing a competitive district in Nevada, opposed an early draft of the House health bill but voted for the final version in May. He said that ultimately, he would expect GOP voters to be frustrated if Congress doesn\u2019t repeal the ACA, or large swaths of it, but he recognizes the political peril either way.\u201cIf somebody\u2019s looking for safe harbor and no hard votes, this is going to be an awful year for them, because I think it\u2019s going to be hard vote after hard vote after hard vote,\u201d he said.\u2014Jennifer Levitz contributed to this articleWrite to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com, Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Delayed Vote Dims Outlook On Health.'", "news_time": "2017-07-16 19:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-push-to-pass-health-care-law-faces-new-setback-1500219899", "news_title": "GOP Push to Pass Health-Care Law Faces New Setback ", "keywords": "congress,health care overhaul,health exchanges,obamacare,senate,white house,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014The European Union is set to target 16 Syrian scientists and military officers in a new round of sanctions against the Assad regime on Monday, seeking to punish those responsible for chemical weapons attacks against civilians.The move is a more limited version of a similar set of U.S. decisions earlier this year which targeted close to 300 people, including 271 employees of the Syria Scientific Studies and Research Centre.The EU measures will also hit scientists at the center, a Syrian government agency that Washington says is responsible for producing chemical and ballistic weapons, according to U.K. officials.The EU sanctions are set to be adopted on Monday at a meeting of the bloc\u2019s foreign ministers. The exact list of targets won\u2019t be known until the names are published Tuesday morning in the bloc\u2019s official journal of record.However, U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson confirmed the decision Sunday night, saying the British government \u201cwill continue to work closely with our international partners to hold perpetrators to account.\u201dThe decision was confirmed by two other European sources.The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons last year said there were several cases of chlorine use as a chemical weapon by the regime of Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad.The U.S., France and Britain are among those who say evidence shows the Assad regime was almost certainly responsible for a sarin nerve gas attack which killed around 100 people in Kham Sheikhoun on April 4, an action that led to U.S. military strikes against Syrian forces.The Syrian government denies those claims.Like the Trump administration, the EU\u2019s approach to the conflict in Syria has been in flux in recent months. The new French President,       Emmanuel Macron,        recently said his government no longer sees the departure of Mr. Assad as a precondition for a political transition in the country.However, the EU has said it won\u2019t provide financial assistance to rebuild the country until a genuine transition away from the current regime takes place. It has cautiously welcomed the cease-fire deal in southern Syria brokered by Moscow and Washington.The EU has built up a broad range of sanctions on Syria since the conflict there broke out, placing an oil embargo and an array of financial and economic sanctions on the Assad regime.The latest sanctions will take the total number of officials under an EU travel ban and asset freeze to 256, in addition to sanctions on 67 entities. Mr. Assad and top members of his government and close family members have all been blacklisted by the bloc.In a visit to Brussels last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, whose government has strongly supported the Assad regime, called for the EU and Washington to relax sanctions, claiming they were hurting civilians.That drew a sharp riposte from EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.\u201cJust to be clear that none of our sanctions on Syria affect civilian population, they are all targeted to individuals who hold specific responsibilities in the war,\u201d she said at a press conference.Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-16 18:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-set-to-sanction-syria-scientists-military-officers-over-chemical-attacks-1500244200", "news_title": "EU Set to Sanction Syria Scientists, Military Officers Over Chemical Attacks ", "keywords": "chemical weapons attack,chlorine,economic sanctions,european union,military officers,nerve gas,sarin,scientists,syria crisis,syrian civil war,syrian conflict,European Union,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,international sanctions,politics,risk news,tariffs,trade barriers,military action,war crimes"}, {"content": "LE-PUY-EN-VELAY, France\u2014The Tour de France is usually more ruthless in beating the world\u2019s best cyclists into submission. By the third week of the race, the combination of pace, heat, and lung-busting climbs tends to break all of the contenders but one\u2014and that one hardman tends to cruise to Paris.But as the 2017 edition heads into its final week, the planet\u2019s most famous bike race is faced with an unusual situation: the Tour de France is suddenly competitive. More competitive, in fact, than it has ever been at this point in the race. Even the handlebar-mustached, brandy-fueled heroes of the early Tours never managed to keep things this close.After 15 stages, the top four in the general classification are within just 29 seconds of each other. The gap from three-time winner Chris Froome, who holds the overall lead, to Italian Fabio Aru is just 18 seconds, with Frenchman Romain Bardet in third, 23 seconds from the lead, and Colombia\u2019s Rigoberto Uran in fourth, another 6 seconds off.The last time the top three were packed anywhere near this tight after two weeks of racing was 1951. The top four, meanwhile, have never been within a minute of each other at this stage.\u201cThe pain is there, because we\u2019re giving 100% physically,\u201d Bardet said in French on Sunday. \u201cBut this is what we\u2019re here for, trying to open up the road, surrounded by teammates, to tip the Tour de France in our favor.\u201dThe reasons the race has stayed close range from a newly perceived weakness in Froome\u2019s Team Sky to the unorthodox layout of the course, plus a healthy dose of the bike racing craziness that the Tour de France has lacked in recent years. Incidents like \u201cFroome\u2019s broken wheel spoke,\u201d \u201cUran\u2019s bent derailleur,\u201d and \u201cBardet\u2019s late-race bottle\u201d have all turned into mini-soap operas with the potential to blow up the standings.\u201cWe knew it would be tight on general classification because of very few summit finishes and very short time trials,\u201d said Froome, who was booed on the road during Sunday\u2019s stage. \u201cBut I\u2019m very grateful that I\u2019m on the right side of the time split.\u201dFlat stages tend not to impact the race for the yellow jersey because the main contenders stay bunched together. So the heavyweights traditionally go at it in stages that finish atop a mountain. But, as Froome noted, there are so few mountaintop showdowns that his rivals are trying to attack him elsewhere, like in descents or on medium-sized climbs. Their problem is that none of them can boast a squad of helpers as deep as Froome\u2019s, assembled with the largest budget in the sport.\u201cYou can see that the levels are very tight between the teams, so you have to try to make the difference where you can,\u201d said Bardet, who is trying to become the first French winner since Bernard Hinault in 1985. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the strongest team, but we\u2019re trying to light a spark in this race.\u201dOne chance may have come and gone on Sunday when Froome suffered a broken spoke with around 30 kilometers to go. It would have been uncouth, according to the Tour\u2019s unwritten rules, but a bold attack in that moment from Bardet, Aru, and Uran might have put one of them back in yellow by the stage\u2019s end.Now, opportunities to steal back precious seconds from Froome are running out. But they do exist in this final week. The 2017 Tour makes its last visit to the high mountains on Wednesday and Thursday with two stages in the Alps. And as Bardet told the French sports daily L\u2019Equipe, \u201ca new Tour begins once you get over 2,000 meters in altitude. No one can hide anymore.\u201dEspecially not Froome, who is looking distinctly more vulnerable this year. (This time last year, his advantage was nearly two minutes.) Last week, he faltered in the Pyrenees and relinquished the yellow jersey for two stages, something he had never done after taking over the lead in any of his three Tour victories. His lieutenant Mikel Landa, an elite all-round cyclist in his own right, has also looked stronger than the man he\u2019s meant to be protecting.But Froome has one more ace up his very skinny sleeve: Saturday\u2019s time-trial in Marseille. As the most accomplished time-triallist of the remaining general classification contenders, he is more than capable of making up any minor losses from the Alps in what cycling calls \u201cthe race of truth\u201d\u2014one man against the clock.\u201cI\u2019ve had a difficult day in the Pyrenees but I feel much better now,\u201d Froome said. \u201cI hope to keep the yellow jersey until the time trial in Marseille.\u201dWhich is just another way of saying, \u201cI hope to keep the yellow jersey until Paris.\u201dWrite to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Race Leaders Bunch Up At the Top.'", "news_time": "2017-07-16 18:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tour-de-france-leaders-bunch-up-at-the-top-1500242625", "news_title": "Tour de France Leaders Bunch Up at the Top", "keywords": "bike,bikes,chris froome,cycling,le tour,tour de france,sports,routine general news"}, {"content": "The New York Hilton Midtown hotel this weekend was transformed into a giant tattoo parlor.About 5,000 attendees and exhibitors descended on the hotel for the two-day New York Empire State Tattoo Expo.

Mr. Ejehi said the person, whom he didn\u2019t identify by name, was appealing an Iranian court\u2019s initial sentence.Mizan identified Mr. Wang as the person, citing an \u201cinformed source.\u201d The agency said Mr. Wang is 37 years old and was born in Beijing. The agency posted information about the case next to a screenshot of Mr. Wang\u2019s profile page at Princeton University.Princeton spokesman       Daniel Day       said Mr. Wang is a fourth-year doctoral candidate specializing in 19th- and early 20th-century Eurasian history. He was in Iran last summer to do research on the late Qajar dynasty for his dissertation, Mr. Day said.\u201cWe were very distressed to learn that charges were brought against him in connection with his scholarly work, and to learn of the subsequent conviction and sentence,\u201d Mr. Day said, adding that the university was doing everything it could to support Mr. Wang and his family.A State Department official said the department was aware of reports of Mr. Wang\u2019s detention but wouldn\u2019t go into detail about U.S. efforts in specific cases for privacy reasons. Yet the official decried Iran\u2019s recent arrests.\u201cThe Iranian regime continues to detain U.S. citizens and other foreigners on fabricated national-security related charges,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe call for the immediate release of all U.S. citizens unjustly detained in Iran so they can return to their families.\u201dMizan described Mr. Wang as a U.S.-Chinese national, but Mr. Day said he only held American citizenship. The Chinese embassy in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Iran has arrested numerous academics, journalists and businesspeople with foreign ties in recent years and charged them with spying. All have denied the charges.The detentions and convictions have persisted despite the 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, which gave Tehran relief from international sanctions in exchange for curbs on its disputed nuclear program.Jason Rezaian, an Iranian-American reporter for the Washington Post, was arrested in 2014 and held on spying charges until his release last year as part of a rare U.S.-Iran prisoner swap just as the nuclear deal took effect.Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe, an Iranian-British national who worked at Thomson Reuters\u2019 charitable arm, was arrested in April last year and sentenced to a five-year term on national security charges. Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese internet freedom advocate and permanent U.S. resident, was arrested in late 2015 and given a 10-year sentence. He has gone on several hunger strikes to protest his treatment at Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison, according to his U.S.-based lawyer.Unlike many of the recent detainees, Mr. Wang doesn\u2019t appear to hold Iranian citizenship.A LinkedIn page with a picture matching Mr. Wang\u2019s appearance and other details consistent with the Mizan news agency\u2019s account says he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006 from the University of Washington, and later studied at Harvard University and then Princeton.Iranian authorities arrested Mr. Wang on Aug. 8, 2016, as he tried to leave Iran for a European country, according to Mizan.Mr. Wang entered Iran allegedly under the pretext of research and tried to gain access to Iranian archives, Mizan said, citing its source. He made digital copies of 4,500 pages of Iranian documents while under surveillance before his arrest, Mizan said.Mr. Wang worked with institutions linked to American and British political, security and intelligence organizations, Mizan said. He also had ties to Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School and the British Institute for Persian Studies, Mizan said, citing its source.Those institutions didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment.\u201cHe would send his studies on Iran directly and indirectly to the organization that had assigned him to do so,\u201d Mizan\u2019s report said. \u201cHe was monitored by security bodies to track down the leaders of the infiltration network inside and outside Iran.\u201d\u2014Nick Timiraos in Washington contributed to this article.Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Iran Gives American 10 Years on Spy Charge.'", "news_time": "2017-07-16 17:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-sentences-princeton-grad-student-on-spy-charges-1500242286", "news_title": "Iran Sentences Princeton Grad Student on Spy Charges", "keywords": " evin prison,iran, iranian detentions, iran nuclear deal, iran spying charges,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,armed forces,international relations,education,nuclear weapons programs,politics,espionage,weapons programs"}, {"content": "When Felisha Trundle received a call from the store manager of Alfred Angelo\u2019s Signature Store in Tulsa, Okla., on Thursday morning, she was told that the store was going out of business and that she needed to pick up her dress that day. When she arrived with her mother a few hours later, she found out that not only did they not have her dress, she was short a $1,200 deposit she had put on the $2,000 wedding gown.\u201cLast night I wanted to throw up,\u201d Ms. Trundle said. \u201cIt is hard to turn back around and spend another $2,000 on a dress. It is coming out of my savings.\u201dAlfred Angelo, one of the nation\u2019s largest bridal retailers, shut its stores and filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy protection Friday. The abrupt closure sent women flocking to the stores, trying to claim gowns for their weddings, and touched off shock waves in the industry.In Rochester, N.Y., Jason Stein and his fianc\u00e9e Jeanie Brockman walked into their local Alfred Angelo store to find the manager crying and customers ordered out of their dresses to leave the store two hours before closing time. \u201cWe\u2019re in a real bind,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cWe actually went above and beyond what we were planning on spending on a dress because she loved it so much.\u201d The couple had already put in a $1,200 deposit and have been leaving voice-mail messages on the unanswered corporate line.Rival retailers and independent stores that count on Alfred Angelo\u2019s manufacturing and wholesale divisions to deliver dresses, said they were surprised at the sudden store closings.Madison Debany, store manager at RK Bridal, an independent boutique in Manhattan, said Alfred Angelo\u2019s collapse will affect many stores like her own that take online orders, since those customers can\u2019t just walk in the store and find another dress. She found out about the closing Thursday on a private             Facebook                   group for bridal stores and manufacturers.According to Ms. Debany, RK Bridal currently has about 100 open orders on Alfred Angelo dresses, most with customers that have either paid in full or left a deposit. On Friday morning, the store received over a dozen calls from concerned customers who were informed that the store would work with them to find new dresses from other designers.Alfred Angelo\u2019s sudden, unexplained shutdown shocked other bridal retailers.\u201cWe are just as much in the dark as the brides are,\u201d said Megan Dumaine, owner of The Wedding Embassy in Oakville, Conn. There was, she said, \u201cno indication\u201d that Alfred Angelo would close its doors suddenly.Other retailers may see a brief boost in sales, but long-term, the abrupt end of Alfred Angelo will take a toll on stores already fighting to keep people walking in their doors, she said.\u201cWhat this does is give brick-and-mortar stores like me that have been in business for 49 years a bad rap,\u201d said Sue Maslowski, owner of Jay West Bridal in Haddonfield, N.J. \u201cBrides will be reluctant to put deposits down, afraid we\u2019ll go out of business.\u201dBoth Ms. Dumaine and Ms. Maslowski said they had stopped carrying the Alfred Angelo line due to a decline in service from the wholesale end of the business as the company added its own retail outlets.With peak wedding season\u2014no, not June, now it\u2019s September to October\u2014looming, and their dresses locked up in dark stores, panicked brides took to             Twitter                   to share stories and information.Rival bridal retailer David\u2019s Bridal used Twitter to reach out to Alfred Angelo\u2019s customers.Ms. Dumaine\u2019s advice? Get off Twitter and get on the phone to the credit card company, to see if they can do anything about goods paid for, but not delivered.Women who had already deposited funds with the big box stores might be reluctant to come up with another $1,200 or more for a wedding dress in a hurry. It is \u201cunfortunate,\u201d Ms. Maslowski said. However, Saturday sees the start of the annual National Bridal Sale, where more than 700 independent stores coast-to-coast, in Canada and Mexico sell off discontinued lines at bargain rates, she noted.Ms. Maslowski spearheads the event. \u201cThis is good for girls who have to get a dress in a hurry,\u201d she said.As to what took down a company that has been around for more than 80 years, and was at one time considered one of the top bridal designers in the country, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess.Alfred Angelo issued a statement Sunday apologizing for the \u201cinconvenience and hardship\u201d resulting from its sudden collapse. It directed customers concerned about the status of their orders to contact bankruptcy trustee Margaret Smith at alfredangelo@mjstrustee.com.Alfred Angelo was founded in Philadelphia in the 1930s by Alfred Angelo Piccione and his wife Edythe Piccione.\u201cThey were considered to be very high-end designers,\u201d said Sally Lorensen Conant, executive director of the Association of Wedding Gown Specialists and owner of Orange Restoration Labs, which restores wedding gowns.Ms. Conant recalled a visit to Alfred Angelo\u2019s headquarters in 1997. \u201cIt was an enormous facility,\u201d she said. \u201cI can remember standing up on a balcony and just looking over a sea of white, all dresses on racks.\u201dAlfred Angelo\u2019s gowns are priced in the midrange, where most of the money is spent, according to       Shane McMurray       of The Wedding Report, an industry research firm. The number of weddings is holding steady, above two million events per year, by Wedding Report\u2019s account.The standard culprit blamed for brick-and-mortar retail bankruptcies, online shopping, may have had something to do with Alfred Angelo\u2019s troubles, according to Ms. Dumaine, the Connecticut bridal shop owner.\u201cWe are dealing with clientele in mid-20s and it\u2019s the way they have learned to shop,\u201d she said.Others, however, aren\u2019t convinced that e-commerce competition was behind Alfred Angelo\u2019s woes. Online sales are growing, Mr. McMurray said, but \u201cnot enough to make a huge dent in the market.\u201d Over the past two years, the percentage of couples that purchase dresses online has grown from just over 17% to 19.5%, he said.\u201cThat is not enough to put them out of business,\u201d Mr. McMurray said.As for Ms. Trundle, whose December wedding is fast approaching, she has already called her bank, Arvest Bank, to dispute the charge and attempt to reclaim her deposit. She has also made appointments with three other Oklahoma City-based bridal stores for a replacement dress. She\u2019s hoping her bank will be able to get her deposit back, but if not, her parents will have to help chip in on a new dress. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to make me walk down the aisle in a pair of jeans,\u201d she said.Write to Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-16 17:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bridal-retailer-alfred-angelo-files-for-bankruptcy-liquidation-1500062536", "news_title": "Sudden Collapse of Bridal Retailer Alfred Angelo Sends Brides-to-Be Scrambling", "keywords": "alfred angelo, alfred angelo chapter 7, alfred angelo shutdown,bankruptcy,bridal,bridal stores, chapter 7,store closures,Alfred Angelo,capacity,facilities,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,facility closures,political,general news,society,community,marriage,divorce,clothing,retail,wholesale,textiles,consumer goods"}, {"content": "The price of the digital currency bitcoin fell over the weekend, dropping below $2,000 and farther away from its June highs, part of a broad selloff in dozens of cryptocurrencies, including ether.Bitcoin on Sunday traded as low as $1,836, according to news and research site CoinDesk, down about 8% on the day, and almost 40% from its high of $3,018 on June 11. Meanwhile, ether, the currency used on the Ethereum network, traded as low as $155 on Sunday, down about 60% from its high of $395 on June 13.Prices were lower across the board on Sunday, most notably for the tokens created via the so-called initial coin offering, or             ICO,       process.The selloffs are yet another stark reminder that for all the potential and promise in these new kinds of digital assets, they remain highly speculative trading vehicles.

It isn\u2019t backed by any government, but is instead secured by incentives and protections built into the program, with the goal of casting aside the need for centralized authority.The prices of bitcoin and ether had massive run-ups this year, and especially since April, mainly on the backs of increased trading in Japan and South Korea, and amid the rise of the ICO, a new kind of capital raising.

The result will be more Venezuelas rippling through the hemisphere.The Venezuelan opposition held its own nationwide referendum on Sunday in an effort to document support for regularly scheduled elections that have been canceled and widespread disapproval of strongman       Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s       plan to rewrite the constitution.The regime was not worried. It said it was using the day as a trial run to prepare for the July 30 elections to choose the assembly that will draft the new constitution.The referendum was an act of national bravery. Yet like the rest of the opposition\u2019s strategy\u2014which aims at dislodging the dictatorship with peaceful acts of civil disobedience\u2014it\u2019s not likely to work. That\u2019s because Cubans, not Venezuelans, control the levers of power.Havana doesn\u2019t care about Venezuelan poverty or famine or whether the regime is unpopular. It has spent a half-century sowing its ideological \u201crevolution\u201d in South America. It needs Venezuela as a corridor to run Colombian cocaine to the U.S. and to Africa to supply Europe. It also relies heavily on cut-rate Venezuelan petroleum.To keep its hold on Venezuela, Cuba has embedded a Soviet-style security apparatus. In a July 13 column, titled \u201cCubazuela\u201d for the Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba website,       Roberto \u00c1lvarez Qui\u00f1ones      reported that in Venezuela today there are almost 50 high-ranking Cuban military officers, 4,500 Cuban soldiers in nine battalions, and \u201c34,000 doctors and health professionals with orders to defend the tyranny with arms.\u201d Cuba\u2019s interior ministry provides Mr. Maduro\u2019s personal security. \u201cThousands of other Cubans hold key positions of the State, Government, military and repressive Venezuelan forces, in particular intelligence and counterintelligence services.\u201dEvery Venezuelan armed-forces commander has at least one Cuban minder, if not more, a source close to the military told me. Soldiers complain that if they so much as mention regime shortcomings over a beer at a bar, their superiors know about it the next day. On July 6 Reuters reported that since the beginning of April \u201cnearly 30 members of the military have been detained for deserting or abandoning their post and almost 40 for rebellion, treason, or insubordination.\u201dThe idea of using civilian thugs to beat up Venezuelan protesters comes from Havana, as Cuban-born author       Carlos Alberto Montaner      explained in a recent El Nuevo Herald column, \u201cVenezuela at the Edge of the Abyss.\u201d Castro used them in the 1950s, when he was opposing Batista, to intimidate his allies who didn\u2019t agree with his strategy. Today in Cuba they remain standard fare to carry out \u201cacts of repudiation\u201d against dissidents.The July 8 decision to move political prisoner       Leopoldo L\u00f3pez       from the       Ramo Verde       military prison to house arrest was classic Castro. Far from being a sign of regime weakness, it demonstrates Havana\u2019s mastery of misdirection to defuse criticism.Cuba\u2019s poisonous influence in Latin America could be weakened if the international community spoke with one voice. The regime needs foreign apologists like former Spanish Prime Minister       Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez       Zapatero and the leftist wing of the Vatican. It also needs the continued support of American backers of the Obama engagement policy, who want the U.S. to turn a blind eye to human-rights abuses.Yet there are limits to what can be brushed off. When opposition congressmen were attacked by Cuban-style mobs on July 5, and their bloodied faces showed up on the front pages of international newspapers, the Zapateros of the world began to squirm. That was Havana\u2019s cue to improve the lighting for Mr. Maduro.First Mr. Maduro claimed he knew nothing about it, though his vice president was on the floor of the legislature while it was happening. That was not believable. Three days later came the sudden decision to move Mr. L\u00f3pez from military prison to house arrest. Mr. Maduro said it was a \u201chumanitarian\u201d gesture. Defense Minister       Vladimir Padrino,        an acolyte of Fidel, said that it was a \u201cproduct of dialogue and tolerance.\u201dThus the images of the savagery in the National Assembly receded while photos of Mr. L\u00f3pez, kissing a Venezuelan flag atop a wall outside his home, popped up everywhere. Mission accomplished and Mr. L\u00f3pez remains detained.For too long the world has overlooked the atrocities of the Cuban police state. In 1989 Fidel was even a special guest at the inauguration of Venezuelan President       Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez.       Today the \u201cspecial guests\u201d are brutalizing Venezuela as the world wonders what went wrong.Write to O\u2019Grady@wsj.com.", "news_time": "2017-07-16 17:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-cuba-runs-venezuela-1500240243", "news_title": "How Cuba Runs Venezuela", "keywords": " communism, cuba, havana, lopez, maduro, riots, socialism,venezuela,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "High winds exacerbated some of wildfires in the west-coast Canadian province of British Columbia over the weekend, and the number of people forced to flee their homes more than doubled to 37,000 in what\u2019s shaping up to be one of the worst forest-fire seasons in over a decade.British Columbia officials provided an update Sunday on the raging forest fires, the day after it issued 10 evacuation orders due to the risk that the most dangerous fires would grow due to strong winds, with gusts reaching up to 40 miles an hour in some parts of the province.The province said as of Sunday there are 37,000 evacuees, up from 17,400 at the start of the weekend, and there are 15 fires that are at risk of threatening local communities. The largest community affected Saturday was Williams Lake, British Columbia, roughly 375 miles north of Vancouver and with a population of 25,000.Winds caused a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in fire activity right across the interior of British Columbia, provincial officials said. Authorities added weather conditions show no signs of improving, with strong winds expected to prevail for the coming weeks, so British Columbia\u2019s 4.7 million residents should brace for a \u201cvery challenging environment\u201d in the weeks ahead.\u201cWith the size of the fire we already have burning, it would take an unseasonably significant rain event to really change the situation now,\u201d said Kevin Skrepnek, a spokesman for the British Columbia Wildfire Service.Todd Stone, British Columbia\u2019s transportation minister, said this was going to be a \u201cdifficult time\u201d for the province. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be ongoing risk for all British Columbians in the interior, and we need all to prepare to evacuate without any notice.\u201dMr. Stone added capacity to take on additional evacuees is starting to become stretched in some parts of the province, most notably the city of Kamloops in central British Columbia, 220 miles northeast of Vancouver.The fires have already forced major lumber producers to shut down operations in British Columbia, and this could disrupt supply for home builders if the fires persist. Last week, lumber futures reached their highest close in 12 years.The last time forest fires in British Columbia sparked a large-scale evacuation was in 2003, when roughly 50,000 people fled their homes and over 640,000 acres of forest were destroyed. Just like now, the weather in British Columbia back in 2003 was hotter and drier than normal, setting the groundwork for one of the worst forest-fire seasons in recent memory.The government of British Columbia declared a state of emergency on July 8. British Columbia estimates there are 162 active wildfires across the province, with 16 fires starting on Saturday. Fifteen forest fires are deemed to pose the most dangerous threat to communities.The fires are estimated to have destroyed 320,000 acres of forest so far this season, which started in April.In May 2016, out-of-control forest fires engulfed Fort McMurray, Alberta, the epicenter of Canadian oil-sands production, forcing the evacuation of 80,000 residents and causing the destruction of 2,400 homes. The fires shut down nearby oil-sands production sites for more than two weeks.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-16 17:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wind-warnings-spark-evacuation-orders-in-western-canada-forest-fires-1500209415", "news_title": "Wind Warnings Spark Evacuation Orders in Western Canada Forest Fires ", "keywords": "british columbia,canada,fire,forest fires,lumber,oil sands,wildfire,wildfires,political,general news,disasters,accidents,natural disasters,catastrophes,risk news"}, {"content": "An error by Dow Jones & Co. in configuring a cloud-computing service left addresses and other information about subscribers to some of its products, including The Wall Street Journal, exposed to possible unauthorized access.About 2.2 million subscribers\u2019 records were affected, a Dow Jones spokesman said. Some of the records included customer names, usernames, email and physical addresses, and the last 4 digits of credit-card numbers, although some records were missing parts of that information, the spokesman said.The exposed data was discovered by UpGuard Inc., a cybersecurity firm, which said they notified Dow Jones of the leak on June 5.\u201cWe immediately remedied the situation and have no reason to believe that any data was taken,\u201d said the Dow Jones spokesman, who said the exposed data didn\u2019t include passwords. He declined to say whether the company planned to notify affected customers. The data \u201cdid not include full credit-card or account-login information that could pose a significant risk for consumers or require notification,\u201d he said.In addition to the subscriber information, the data also included information relating to Dow Jones\u2019s Risk & Compliance service, which helps companies follow international regulations, the spokesman said. According to UpGuard, this database contained information on 1.6 million people and entities. Dow Jones said that this data is taken from publicly available sources, but didn\u2019t confirm the number of entries in the database.The episode is one of a series of inadvertent leaks on cloud-computing systems by companies as they move more of their data from servers that they operate themselves to those managed by Amazon and others.On Wednesday, for example,             Verizon                   said one of its vendors had inadvertently exposed data on about 6 million customers under circumstances similar to the Dow Jones incident. In a statement,             Verizon                   said that it had confirmed that there was \u201cno loss or theft of             Verizon                   or Verizon customer information\u201d as a result of the incident.In both the Dow Jones and Verizon cases, administrators had misconfigured their Amazon cloud storage servers, UpGuard said. In Dow Jones\u2019 case, the data was visible to anyone with an Amazon Web Services account, said       Chris Vickery,        a researcher with UpGuard, which also discovered the Verizon incident. UpGuard uses software tools that guess the internet addresses of exposed data to raise awareness about cyberrisk issues, the company said. The company sells software and services that help companies detect this type of configuration problem.An Amazon spokeswoman said that its cloud-storage service is configured by default to only be accessible to the account owners. \u201cWell over a million customers continue to use Amazon S3 safely and securely,\u201d she said.Software developers sometimes change the settings to speed up performance or make collaboration within a company easier, Mr. Vickery said.

But she has been criticized for a Georgia childhood obesity program that accepted funds from             Coca-Cola Co.\u2019s       foundation and for offering controversial anti-aging remedies as a practicing obstetrician-gynecologist.Dr. Fitzgerald, 71 years old, grew up in Middlesboro, Ky., a town in coal-mining country. She \u201cmet this cute boy in medical school\u201d at Emory University and has been in Georgia ever since, practicing as an OB-GYN for three decades, raising a daughter and son, and serving state Republican leaders. She was Georgia\u2019s public health commissioner from 2011 until she was named to her CDC post.She said she is commuting to her new job from her home in Carrollton, Ga., nearly 60 miles west of Atlanta because \u201cthat cute boy I married\u2014he grew up there. He\u2019s not moving.\u201dShe calls herself a \u201cstrong advocate for vaccines\u201d and says she supports making reliable contraception available, two issues that have been scrutinized by the new administration.Rates of premature births can be brought down by spacing births, saving on health-care costs, she said, an approach that generally requires contraception. Caring for a premature infant in the first year, of life costs about 10 times as much as caring for a healthy, full-term baby, making it one of the most expensive health-care needs, and that added costs extend well beyond the first year. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d she said.She believes decisions about abortion should be made \u201cbetween a woman and her doctor,\u201d with limitations. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no case once a child is viable,\u201d she said. But, she added, \u201cI did not do abortions in my practice.\u201dThe CDC collects data on abortions but doesn\u2019t fund them.Dr. Fitzgerald said that preventing the spread of infectious disease will remain a priority for the agency. \u201cQuite frankly, it\u2019s our responsibility,\u201d she said.That includes doing more to prevent antibiotic resistance, tracking emerging infections overseas and helping other countries build their infectious-disease-fighting capacities, she said.Battling the U.S.\u2019s biggest killers will also be a focus for the CDC under her leadership, she said, though she didn\u2019t cite specifics. Fighting opioid addiction\u2014which killed more than 33,000 people in the U.S. in 2015\u2014is a priority for the administration, her spokeswoman said.She said she also wants to make advances in an area she championed as Georgia\u2019s public health commissioner: children\u2019s early brain development. \u201cIf we can change something at the very beginning that is a simple intervention like language development, that\u2019s a phenomenal chance to influence that child\u2019s entire life,\u201d she said.Dr. Fitzgerald has come under fire for the Georgia SHAPE childhood obesity program, which took $1 million from 2013 to 2015 from the Coca-Cola Foundation to promote physical activity.She said that the state purposely sought partners from every sector, including large area employers such as Coca-Cola, to join its $57 million program. The program promotes eating fresh fruits and vegetables in addition to physical activity, she said.\u201cI think if you\u2019re going to solve a big problem, you\u2019ve got to have a public-private partnership,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you have to do is start at that place on which there is agreement and work from there.\u201dAs a practicing OB-GYN, Dr. Fitzgerald said she took continuing education courses to become a fellow in anti-aging medicine after getting many questions from menopausal patients. Such therapies include bioidentical hormones, which are identical in molecular structure to the hormones women make in their bodies.They are often marketed as a safer alternative to traditional hormone replacement therapy, but have skeptics because they haven\u2019t been well studied. The Food and Drug Administration says it doesn\u2019t have evidence that bioidentical hormones are safer or more effective than other hormone products.\u201cOne, I was curious, two, I wanted to see what the scientific data was there,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to be able to answer patients\u2019 questions.\u201dShe said she believes there is more research to be done on the therapies.

Walking down the aisle is a new thing in China.Plus, it was sweltering and one groomsman wanted to shed his suit jacket.Here to save the day was the hired wedding host, a combination emcee, cheerleader and Miss Manners ready to guide guests through the fashionable but still-strange traditions of Western weddings.\u201cCome on, keep it on,\u201d said Mao Bokun to the sweaty attendant. \u201cFirst groomsman, here,\u201d marking the place, herding the party into line.Later, when the young women present hesitated at the back of the crowd as the bride prepared to throw the bouquet, Mr. Mao coaxed them to the front. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy,\u201d he said, helping people understand it was an honor to catch it.Western-style weddings, a byproduct of China\u2019s rising affluence and openness, are relatively new here, and people are still getting the hang of it.When the best man won\u2019t take the stage to share memories, or when the newlyweds balk at beginning the first dance, Mr. Mao and his fellow hosts earn their pay. A cottage industry over the past decade has sprung up to book their services.One company, Langyi Studio, has more than 300 hosts in its stable, with top performers charging more than $2,500 a wedding. All of them must complete training classes in skills such as voice and presentation, and abide by strict rules, including refusing the cash tips in red envelopes that are ubiquitous in China.Langyi scores hosts on stage presence and other attributes, and will dock a host\u2019s pay for garbling the name of the happy couple or other infractions.Host       Wang Gang,        27 years old, said he does vocal exercises at least four times a week to keep his speaking voice strong. For inspiration, Mr. Wang watches American romance movies that celebrate the triumph of love, such as \u201cThe Notebook,\u201d and memorizes verses from love songs to recite at weddings.\u201cIt\u2019s a mode of life,\u201d he said.These days, divorce rates in China are rising and social media is filled with lascivious tales of rich businessmen and slinky mistresses. Cynicism abounds, but Mr. Wang brims with sincerity.\u201cIt\u2019s a hard line of work if you don\u2019t believe in love,\u201d said Mr. Wang. \u201cYou\u2019d feel like a quack.\u201dMr. Mao also tries to heighten the emotion of the ceremony, especially if the guests are all close friends. \u201cYou have couples reciting \u2018I do\u2019 without feeling, but I want to put them in the mood, to have them really experience the moment,\u201d he said.Host       Zhang Lei,        35, said she began her career after seeing a young wedding host with \u201cthe aura of a movie star\u201d charm the crowd.\u201cThe bride and groom are like a bottle of red wine, and I\u2019m a bottle opener,\u201d she said.For most of Chinese history, weddings were about carrying on family lines and were typically arranged by parents. In the traditional Confucian ceremony, the couple first bowed to the heaven and earth, then to their ancestors and parents, and finally to each other.Brides wore a veil of red silk and didn\u2019t speak. A respected elder or village leader would officiate.Under Chairman Mao, arranged marriages were banned. Women, he proclaimed, \u201chold up half the sky\u201d and should have consent.Still, the Communist Party had the power to approve or reject marriages in order to serve the state\u2019s agenda. Celebrations became austere, and many traditions were abandoned.Today, as China has become more open to the West, young couples with the means are filling that vacuum by opting for fancy affairs in hotels or special venues.On a recent Sunday, Mr. Mao, 35, took charge at Bride Elysee, a wedding venue with eight banquet halls and four ornate rooms resembling chapels. The constellations of the zodiac, illuminated in purple lights, lined the walls. A wedding ceremony and lunch for 100 people starts at about $18,000.The ceremony launched at 10:28 a.m.\u2014the number 8 is considered lucky.\u201cPlease take your seats,\u201d rang out Mr. Mao\u2019s voice over the microphone, echoing up to the ceiling of decorative arches.Professional photographers dashed around to clear the aisle, a glass floor lighted with blue lights and sprinkled with rose petals. Chattering guests, without a clear dress code, wore everything from dark suits and cocktail dresses to shorts and flip flops.The doors swung open for the groom,       Zhang Zheng,        and Mr. Mao began to narrate what was happening and cue the next action: \u201cHe\u2019s by his parents\u2019 side, receiving their warm hugs.\u201dThe bride, Qian Yaping, entered next, escorted by her father. Mr. Mao, who also served as officiant\u2014most Chinese don\u2019t practice organized religions with clergy\u2014led the couple through an exchange of vows and rings. The couple then signed a ceremonial marriage certificate with white feather pens.Then it was on to the adjoining banquet hall for lunch, where tables were laden with platters of fried shrimp, lobster, braised beef and fried rice. Red wine and sodas flowed.The entertainment began. It included three young women in short skirts and knee-high boots dancing first to Vivaldi, and later to the pop song \u201cCan I Be Your Plus One.\u201dMr. Mao grimaced from the sidelines\u2014China\u2019s wedding hosts aren\u2019t involved in traditional wedding planner duties on music, food or flowers. \u201cLe-oh!\u201d he sighed, using Chinese slang meaning \u201clow class.\u201dSoon, Mr. Mao\u2019s portion of the entertainment began, and he came back to the stage to lead a game of \u201cName That Tune,\u201d handing out stuffed animals to participants.The previous day, at the outdoor wedding, Mr. Mao had focused on getting the couple to share stories about themselves.The groom,       Zhang Chen,        met his bride,       Yun Qing,        through mutual friends three years ago. Mr. Mao tells the crowd that the groom worked up the courage to call Ms. Yun on the pretense of learning how to make fried rice with eggs.Mr. Mao, a former electronics-equipment salesman who has been a wedding host for nearly a decade, soon gets the groom to reveal where he asked for a first kiss\u2014in Beijing\u2019s 798 Art District\u2014and then gets Ms. Yun to describe her emotions when Mr. Zhang proposed.\u201cMy heart was jumping in the moment,\u201d she said.All this had at least one bridesmaid breaking down in tears of joy.

Disagreements continue over how the communications shop should be organized and on what policies the team should concentrate, White House officials said. These conflicts have impaired the president\u2019s ability to hire experienced Republican communicators, with even some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters declining White House posts.Scott Jennings,        a consistent defender of the president on television and an ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, refused White House inquiries about taking a senior-level position in the communications department, two White House officials said.But the team\u2019s biggest hurdle may be inside the Oval Office. Mr. Trump, who often says he is his own best adviser on politics and communications, frequently strays from the White House\u2019s script and has fought attempts to tone down his             Twitter                   persona, of which many top aides\u2014and a majority of the American public\u2014say they disapprove. Several senior administration officials privately complain that the White House\u2019s main problem is decision-making, not public relations.The current health-care debate has underscored the White House\u2019s conundrum, said       Newt Gingrich,        who remains a political adviser to Mr. Trump. He cautioned that the White House team is \u201cstill learning\u201d about its own power but said it was unclear what the Trump White House wanted to accomplish in the health-care debate.\u201cCoke believes that after 130 years, consumers still need to hear about Coke seven days a week to be reminded to buy it,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cBrute repetition is the only way to break through, and it\u2019s hard to know right now what [the White House is] supposed to be selling.\u201dSean Spicer,        the White House press secretary, said the White House is pushing to expand access to health care and lower costs for U.S. workers.\u201cWe have utilized all of the resources of the administration to advance the president\u2019s goal of repealing and replacing Obamacare with a patient-centered health-care system, he said.The Senate plans to vote on an overhaul of health-insurance laws soon, the Republican-controlled chamber\u2019s second attempt to do so. The outcome remains uncertain, yet the White House\u2019s marketing effort this week is \u201cMade in America,\u201d not health-care reform.\u2018Coke believes that after 130 years, consumers still need to hear about Coke seven days a week to be reminded to buy it. Brute repetition is the only way to break through, and it\u2019s hard to know right now what [the White House is] supposed to be selling.\u2019Last week, the president posted tweets urging passage of the law during his visit to France and devoted his weekly address\u00a0on Friday\u00a0to it. His team has lobbied senators and influential governors, including Nevada Gov.       Brian Sandoval,        for their support.Although health-care reform was a central plank in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, the president\u2019s attention has been diverted by other priorities as well as news about investigations into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and whether anyone in the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Russia has denied interfering with the election, and Mr. Trump has said there was no collusion.Before Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell postponed his chamber\u2019s first health-care vote on June 27, the White House had spent a month dispatching its messengers to talk about almost anything but health insurance policy.\u200bIn an effort to impose message discipline, the communications shop orchestrated\u200ba series of \u201ctheme weeks,\u201d\u200bdesigned to focus both the president and his senior team on one core policy issue at a time. But the themes were often overtaken by the news of the day and legislation winding its way through Congress, and the president himself often veered off message.During the first full week of June, the White House declared it would focus on infrastructure, one of the president\u2019s campaign promises. But the West Wing remains weeks away, perhaps months, from settling on an infrastructure plan, officials said.From Monday through Friday during \u201cinfrastructure week,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted an average of about five times a day, including roughly once each day about infrastructure. But he also tweeted multiple times about his ban on travel for residents of several Muslim-majority countries into the U.S.He used his social-media perch that week to repeatedly attack \u201cfake news,\u201d his pejorative for unflattering reports in the mainstream media, and to criticize London Mayor       Sadiq Kahn       for saying there was \u201cno reason to be alarmed\u201d about additional police in his city following a terrorist attack on London Bridge.Infrastructure was followed by White House theme weeks on energy, workforce development and technology. Mr. Spicer said the theme weeks were better received in local press than national media.The strategy is receiving mixed reviews internally.Mr. Trump was largely pleased with the effort, according to one official familiar with the president\u2019s thinking. But one senior administration official said theme weeks exposed the White House as \u201cnaive.\u201dA second senior White House official said the theme weeks were \u201cstupid,\u201d particularly during a month in which the health-care debate should have been the priority.A White House spokesman declined to comment on the criticisms.The push for theme weeks came from Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, and       Rick Dearborn,        a deputy staff chief, White House officials said.Messrs. Priebus and Dearborn put the plan in place after an attempt by       Jared Kushner,        Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior White House adviser, and       Steve Bannon,        the president\u2019s chief strategist, to reorganize the communications office, White House officials said.Messrs. Bannon and Kushner discussed reshaping the press shop before the president\u2019s first foreign trip in May, the officials said. Their plan would have separated the job of handling news briefings from the rest of the communications shop, among other changes, the officials said.But Mr. Spicer maintained control of the office as he adopted a lower-key approach and held fewer on-camera news briefings, which Mr. Trump had frequently interrupted White House meetings to watch, the officials said.Now, Mr. Spicer\u2019s team is returning to the theme weeks but with a more targeted approach. After highlighting American-made products this week, next week will be devoted to American jobs and workers, a White House official said. A third week will be dedicated to the \u201cAmerican dream,\u201d the person said.On Monday, the president will tour a display of American-made products inside the White House and on the South Lawn. He will also make remarks to the media about the administration\u2019s commitment to American-made products and the workers and companies who make them.The plan, Mr. Spicer said, is to build a foundation for the president\u2019s argument for tax reform, identifying the workers and companies that would benefit from Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach.Mr. Trump can then finally return to one of the issue that, unlike health care, truly animates him\u2014tax reform.\u201cAs we get into August, we\u2019ll be talking more specifically about tax reform,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cThis definitely starts that process.\u201dWrite to Michael C.

Congress has every right to make a strong statement on Russia\u2019s alleged interference in last year\u2019s presidential election. But this bill, which is awaiting a vote in the House, will not achieve its objectives and will instead cause new problems. Unless it undergoes significant revision, it would compromise European energy security and damage U.S. relations with Europe. The beneficiary of such an outcome would be Russia.At risk is the joint stance the U.S. and Europe have maintained against Russia since it annexed Crimea in 2014. Every sanctions measure was assessed by American and European partners before enactment. Europe and the U.S. moved hand in hand to ensure that neither would exploit markets or business opportunities previously held by the other. This trans-Atlantic approach is now jeopardized by the Senate\u2019s desire to impose additional sanctions unilaterally, without consultation and against the explicit will of the European Commission and key U.S. allies including Germany, France and Italy.Even worse, the bill\u2019s language suggests that it aims to advance U.S. commercial interests at Europe\u2019s expense. Section 257 prioritizes \u201cthe export of United States energy resources to create American jobs\u201d\u2014which sounds to Europeans like an unfriendly political attempt to promote U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe.One target of the bill is the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, involving both Russian and European companies. There are good arguments why Europe should diversify its gas supply, but the dependency fears around NS2 are exaggerated. Europe has taken decisive measures to boost supply security: constructing additional interconnectors and LNG terminals, employing reverse flow capabilities, and eliminating restrictive clauses on ultimate destinations. These measures make it difficult for Russia even to consider using energy as a weapon against Europe.There is a vibrant debate in Europe about NS2 and the best way forward. Strong arguments, both pro and con, are being exchanged. The Polish and Ukrainian governments are concerned that the pipeline will compete against Russian gas flowing through pipelines in their territories. Some, including German Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        propose to welcome all additional sources and supply routes of energy to Europe, including American LNG. Ideally, the market would decide the best course.This is not a question that should be decided in Washington. It is a European issue, to be decided by Europeans based on European law and regulation. How would the U.S. react if Europe were to pass legislation on the merits of the Keystone XL pipeline, especially if it was perceived to benefit European business?Even if one opposes NS2, the Senate-passed bill would harm Eurasian energy security in other important ways. Perhaps most egregiously, the bill would extend sanctions to countries outside Russia where U.S. persons provide goods, services and technology for certain projects \u201cin which a Russian energy firm is involved.\u201d The presence of Lukoil, a private Russian company, in Azerbaijan could potentially trigger sanctions on the Shah Deniz gas field and deter Caspian gas shipments to Europe via the emerging Southern Corridor. Under such a threat, banks could renege on financing. Rather than promote security, the bill would jeopardize one of Europe\u2019s new gas pipeline alternatives to Russia, a $45 billion undertaking that is well under way. This provision would force American companies out of joint ventures in which Russian companies participate around the world.The bill would expose to sanctions goods, services, technology and information that would \u201csignificantly facilitate\u201d even the maintenance of pipelines carrying Russian oil and gas or passing through Russia. That could stall two-thirds of Kazakhstan\u2019s oil exports shipped through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which is led by             Chevron                   but has a 31% Russian government share. It could hinder operations and safety for pipelines, such as those passing through Ukraine, that deliver some 32% of Europe\u2019s oil and a similar share of its gas consumption. For Europe, terminating such large oil or gas imports from Russia is not feasible: alternatives for such large volumes are unavailable.Our joint U.S.-European experience with sanctions affirms two longstanding lessons. First, sanctions work best when they are multilateral. Second, sanctions alone rarely achieve a national-security outcome. Ideally, they create leverage. They almost always presume a negotiation, where adjusting the sanctions can be part of a strategy for achieving a desired goal.Leverage goes hand-in-hand with flexibility\u2014and the Senate bill would curtail flexibility. Its unilateral approach could tip the scales in favor of those who want to end Europe\u2019s participation in the existing trans-Atlantic policy approach on Russia, including the sanctions regime.If the bill becomes law in its current form, it would alienate America\u2019s important European allies, complicating our alliance at a critical moment. A better approach would be to revise the bill in line with realities and recommit to a joint trans-Atlantic approach.Mr. Ischinger was Germany\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., 2001-06, and has been chairman of the Munich Security Conference since 2008.", "news_time": "2017-07-16 15:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-europeans-oppose-the-russia-sanctions-bill-1500232733", "news_title": "Why Europeans Oppose the Russia Sanctions Bill", "keywords": " energy security, eu, european union, natural gas, nord stream, oil,russia, sanctions, senate,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,commentaries,opinions,energy,pipeline transportation,oil,natural gas midstream operations"}, {"content": "In the 1990s the 1789 Restaurant in Washington, which is still around today, hired Georgetown University athletes as valets. I was not a Georgetown athlete, but I covered for one over winter break and earned a permanent spot in the holiday rotation.The job was fantastic. Parking cars wasn\u2019t hard labor, and the chef had a soft spot for valets, so we always ate well. I think he enjoyed watching us knock back peanut soup while huddled in a stairwell below street level.The ma\u00eetre d\u2019 was a gentleman. When a valet dined in the restaurant\u2014say, with his girlfriend\u2014this courtly man made sure the couple was given a table by the fireplace and treated like royalty. Once, when dining with my now-wife, the chef asked if it was my first time having the venison. I told him it was my first time having the venison indoors, at a table with silverware and without gloves.The two valets per shift pooled their tips because it would be unseemly to fight over the fanciest cars. Not that we could ever really tell who would tip well. The most bankable car for a \u201cpar\u201d tip\u2014Georgetown golfers had designed the scoring system\u2014was the Chrysler LeBaron.Everyone had a \u201cbest tip\u201d story. Mine featured a guy who, when he handed over his keys, tore a $50 bill in my face, gave me half, and told me I would get the other half at the end of the night. I did, and some tape and one dimly lit convenience store later, I made change and went home happy.Of all the tip stories I heard, Sean\u2019s stands out. I didn\u2019t work with Sean that night, but I trust Tom, the valet who did.One night Sean retrieved a car while Tom chatted with its owner. Sean handed back the keys and received his tip. One thing valets do well is discreetly identify cash. As the car drove off, Sean realized he was holding a $100 bill.\u201cHow\u2019d we do?\u201d Tom asked. \u201cA hundred dollars,\u201d Sean answered. \u201cUnbelievable!\u201d Tom exclaimed. But Sean disagreed. \u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at that car. No way he meant to give us this.\u201dSean sprinted after it. He caught the car three blocks away and explained the situation to the speechless driver, who hadn\u2019t intended, and couldn\u2019t afford, to tip so much. The driver took back the money, gave Sean a new tip and drove off.Tom started in on Sean while he was still half a block away. \u201cWell?\u201d Sean affirmed that the $100 had been a mistake. \u201cHe tipped us, though,\u201d Sean added, a faint smile on his face. \u201cThree bucks.\u201dI\u2019ve had many occasions over the years to think about that story. When the driver took back the $100, what should he have given in its place? What was the minimum to ensure Sean stayed on the high road the next time around? Every time I\u2019ve considered it, $20 has always seemed right.Only now do I realize the question is irrelevant. Only now do I know why Sean smiled. He wouldn\u2019t even have minded getting stiffed. Sean had already made up his mind when he started running.

We have millions of options for digital entertainment, keep a universe of information in our back pockets and can call nearly anywhere on earth for a pittance. To most consumers, government seems a minor player. So what\u2019s wrong with communications regulation?As       Thomas Hazlett       explains in \u201cThe Political Spectrum,\u201d there are many problems, and they have enormous consequences. Economic activity is increasingly conducted wirelessly, under a regulatory regime developed nearly a century ago\u2014one that favors well-heeled incumbents and does little to encourage efficient use of the spectrum. The difficulty that new entrants face in securing spectrum, along with a system that locks in existing technology, chills investment in next-generation infrastructure.Given the exciting promise of today\u2019s technology, how did we end up hamstrung by such a backward regulatory regime? Mr. Hazlett provides a fascinating history. When radio technology began to spread around the turn of the 20th century, there was a need to ensure that signals sent over the wireless spectrum didn\u2019t interfere with one another. When nearby ships did not hear the distress calls from the Titanic, government stepped in to control interference between transmitters and to make sure that seagoing vessels had radio priority. Secretary of Commerce       Herbert Hoover       built on these efforts in the 1920s, seeing in radio\u2019s growing influence an opportunity to use government\u2019s regulatory power as an instrument of political control. The result was the Radio Act of 1927, which established a system under which consumers have routinely taken a back seat to those with outsize influence in Washington.Mr. Hazlett cites as an example the 1930s-era drama surrounding FM radio. From the start, FM had much better sound fidelity than AM\u2014and so threatened existing AM networks operated by NBC, CBS and AT&T\u2019s wired long-distance telephone network. These companies used the Federal Communications Commission to hamper the development of FM and succeeded in having it moved to a different band after World War II. This rendered all existing FM equipment\u2014purchased by consumers at no small expense\u2014useless and limited stations\u2019 transmission power such that their audiences became too small to sustain a competitive business. So distressing was the episode that the father of FM radio,       Edwin Howard Armstrong,        ended his own life in 1954. The sad saga was merely an early example of the FCC exhibiting the \u201ccapture theory\u201d of regulation, according to which regulators and legislators enact rules nominally in the public interest but in fact designed to enrich specific interest groups.By Thomas Winslow Hazlett  Yale, 401 pages, $35With informative vignettes, Mr. Hazlett elaborates on this flaw in our regulatory structure, exposing how inefficient, and perhaps corrupt, our spectrum policy really is. The regulatory process has blocked thousands of radio stations, delayed cellular service and propped up broadcast television. The cost has been borne by consumers, who have been denied the fruits of innovation, choice and competition.Mr. Hazlett devotes a substantial portion of his book to arguments for reforms, the most promising of which rest on the Nobel Prize-winning work of British economist       Ronald Coase.       Coase showed that, absent transaction costs, well-defined assets will wind up in the hands of the entities that value them most. By assigning property rights to frequencies\u2014thereby turning them into assets and enabling the pricing mechanism\u2014immense value can be created from the more efficient employment of bandwidth. For years, the concept of treating bandwidth like property and distributing it through competitive auctions seemed like a pipe dream. In the 1970s, two FCC commissioners said that the odds that this approach would be adopted \u201cwere equal to \u2018those on the Easter Bunny in the Preakness.\u2019 \u201d Well, the Easter Bunny won, and in 1994 the FCC started auctioning wireless licenses.While most traditional spectrum allocation continues under the longstanding discretionary regime, competitive bidding has raised more than $100 billion for the U.S. Treasury. More important, the competitively acquired licenses have brought much greater flexibility: Rather than having the FCC lock in the technologies and services for which the bandwidth can be used, license owners are allowed to decide how to use it, and they can change their technologies and business plans in response to a dynamic mobile wireless marketplace.While Mr. Hazlett covers other reform alternatives, his own preference is for strong, well-defined property rights. He is especially fond of auctioning broad \u201coverlay\u201d licenses, which allow their owners to transmit over unoccupied bands of spectrum near existing users and then bargain with the incumbents to entice them to vacate. An inefficient user of a particular band\u2014a low-value television signal, say\u2014might find that a proposed payment exceeds the value of remaining in business at that wavelength. The holder of the overlay license\u2014a 4G wireless company, perhaps\u2014thinks it can create more value from that band than it pays the TV station to clear it. Everybody wins.Mr. Hazlett may be overly sanguine about the potential for overlay auctions\u2014he neglects, for example, the transaction costs associated with the thousands of contingent negotiations his approach would require. Nevertheless, \u201cThe Political Spectrum\u201d is full of valuable instruction\u2014especially for lawyers, economists and other students of regulation for whom the book provides example after example of the strategic use of the regulatory process. Potential entrepreneurs in fields where regulation may be a barrier\u2014fintech, pharma and transportation, for example\u2014will benefit too, finding cautionary tales about how to enter a market with a disruptive idea.And for consumers and the public, \u201cThe Political Spectrum\u201d is a good reminder of how far we have come. Today few economists question the benefits of well-defined rights, flexible use and auctions. That we are debating how to implement these ideas, rather than whether to do so, is reason for cautious optimism about our wireless future.Mr. Rosston is director of the Public Policy Program at Stanford University.", "news_time": "2017-07-16 15:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/unlocking-the-airwaves-1500232514", "news_title": "Unlocking the Airwaves", "keywords": "book review,recommended books,corporate,industrial news,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,reviews,broadcasting,media"}, {"content": "Investment in Manhattan commercial real estate increased between the first two quarters of this year but dropped dramatically from last year as forces threatening a rebound in the market remain, according to a report and data from real-estate services firm Avison Young.Sales in the second quarter rose to about $5.6 billion, a 74% increase from about $3.2 billion tracked in the first quarter of this year.

It is also raising the minimum amount that cardholders must spend in the first three months to earn the reward to $7,500 from $4,000. Both changes take effect\u00a0July 23.Points have become a valued currency for many consumers, especially in the travel sector where they can be redeemed for airfare and hotel stays.

Revenue for Citi-branded North America cards increased 10% to $2.1 billion, though the bank\u2019s credit costs continue to rise as it grows its card portfolio.Citigroup is also beefing up the Prestige card\u2019s hotel benefit. Under the changes,\u00a0Citi\u00a0will allow cardholders to get their fourth night in a hotel free, regardless of whether they paid for the first three with dollars or points.The sign-up bonus for Prestige, which carries a $450 annual fee, doesn\u2019t rival the 100,000 points that J.P. Morgan used to offer on the Sapphire Reserve card in exchange for spending $4,000 in the first three months. That came to an end in March.J.P. Morgan has been looking at ways to use Sapphire Reserve to get consumers to sign up for other products. In May, it began offering the 100,000 points for people who apply for a new mortgage from the bank through\u00a0Aug. 6\u00a0and receive one.Citi\u2019s changes aren\u2019t all upgrades.\u00a0Under another one going into effect\u00a0July 23, Prestige\u00a0cardholders who use their\u00a0points\u00a0to book airfare will see the value of each point drop to 1.25 cents from a range of 1.33-1.6 cents.

May housing starts declined 5.5%, indicating a mismatch between tight supply and solid demand. Some analysts attributed the drop in starts to a short supply of labor in the construction industry. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect starts increased 5.5% in June.THURSDAYThe Bank of Japan holds its monetary policy meeting, which will feature a press conference with Gov.       Haruhiko Kuroda.       Central bank watchers expect the bank will raise its economic assessment while cutting its inflation forecast for the financial year.The European Central Bank meets, just weeks after ECB President       Mario Draghi       hinted the ECB might start winding down its stimulus in response to accelerating growth in Europe. Any move toward reducing bond purchases would put the ECB on a similar path to the Federal Reserve, which has signaled an intent to taper its own stimulus program.

Its representatives refused to pass through the metal detectors and called on other worshipers to pray outside the gates until Israel removed them, raising tensions in the area around the site.\u201cWe reject all forms of such aggressive measures,\u201d said Sheikh Omar Kiswani, the Waqf director for Al Aqsa mosque, which sits on the esplanade. The Temple Mount is known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. \u201cIt\u2019s the right of all Muslims to pray at the Holy Sanctuary as respected human beings.\u201dMr. Kiswani also urged Israeli authorities to open all the gates to the Temple Mount to accommodate the usually huge number of worshipers, especially on Fridays. \u201cWe have nothing to do with the attack and so our rights as worshipers should be maintained,\u201d he said.Israel\u2019s Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said Sunday that \u201cthe metal detectors are for the security of the worshipers and visitors.\u201d A spokesman for Israeli police said the new security measures will continue as long as necessary based on the government\u2019s security assessment.Israeli officials said \u201cpolice are posted at the Temple Mount gates to prevent attempts of provocation or disturbing the peace.\u201dThe Temple Mount will be gradually reopened to worshipers and visitors as part of Israel\u2019s policy to maintain the status quo, Prime Minister       Benjamin Netanyahu       had said in a statement late Saturday.The prime minister\u2019s decision followed discussions with Israel\u2019s top security leadership. The reopening will include increased security measures such as metal detectors and security cameras around the Temple Mount, according to the statement.Three gunmen killed two Israeli police officers near the entrance of the Temple Mount on Friday before being shot dead by Israeli security forces. One person also was wounded in the attack.Officials identified the two slain police officers, both members of Israel\u2019s minority Druse community, as Haiel Sitawe, 30, from the town of Maghar, and Kamil Shnaan, 22, from Hurfeish.The attackers were Arab citizens of Israel from the mainly Arab town of Umm al-Fahm, near the northern city of Haifa, according to Israeli police. They were relatives and ranged in age from 19 to 29.In a rare move that drew protests from some Palestinians, Israeli police canceled Friday prayers at the mosque after the attack. Authorities on Friday also banned all Palestinians living in the West Bank and holding permits to enter Jerusalem from entering Israel.Israeli security forces entered the Temple Mount and checked the area for any further threats, a break with Israel\u2019s longstanding practice of refraining from operating there to avoid friction. The inspection was necessary to prevent more violence, a senior Israeli official said.The search on the Mount was \u201ccoordinated and accompanied by Waqf officials so as not to desecrate the site,\u201d Jerusalem District Commander Yoram Halevy said Sunday on Army Radio. He noted that dozens of knives, slingshots, clubs, spikes, stun grenades and incitement materials were found on the Mount, but no live ammunition was uncovered.The Temple Mount has often been the focus of violence between Palestinians and Israeli security forces.In 2000, Ariel Sharon, then head of the Likud party and later Israel\u2019s prime minister, entered the plaza, sparking violence that expanded into the second Palestinian uprising, or intifada.A new wave of Temple Mount-related violence broke out in September 2015, in part amid Palestinian claims that Israel was encroaching on the plaza and was seeking to change the longtime status quo over access to it. The bloodshed left hundreds dead, many of them Palestinian attackers.The Temple Mount, in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, was the location of an ancient Jewish temple. It is bordered on one side by the Western Wall of the temple, considered the holiest site in Judaism. Al Aqsa mosque is the third holiest site in Islam, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.While only Muslims are currently allowed to pray on the Temple Mount, Jews are permitted to visit the area.\u2014Nuha Musleh in Ramallah, Abubakr Bashir in Gaza City and Margaret Coker in Istanbul contributed to this article.Appeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Israel Reopens Holy Site in Attack\u2019s Wake.'", "news_time": "2017-07-16 14:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerusalems-temple-mount-to-reopen-after-attack-1500195130", "news_title": "Jerusalem\u2019s Temple Mount Reopens After Attack ", "keywords": " israel, jerusalem,temple mount,assault,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,islam,religion"}, {"content": "Industrial developers have been accelerating efforts to construct new warehouse buildings and meet strong demand in New Jersey, but tenants looking for modern large spaces still face limited options, according to reports from real estate services firms.In the first half of the year, 5.1 million square feet of new industrial space has been added, exceeding all of last year\u2019s total of 4.2 million square feet, according to Cushman & Wakefield. About 79% of this year\u2019s new space has been leased, according to Cushman data.By the end of the year, the total of new industrial space is expected to pass 10 million square feet.E-commerce-related tenants are driving the quest for space in addition to demand from traditional industrial and warehouse users, said       Jules Nissim,        a Cushman executive managing director.

Others attending included the Trump campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, and Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is now a senior White House adviser.Democrats and some Republicans have said the meeting showed that the Trump campaign knew about the Russian government\u2019s desire to influence the election on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf. Mr. Trump and his son have said the meeting was short and that nothing came of it.\u201cThe meeting itself and those proposed discussions would not have been violations of the law,\u201d said Mr. Sekulow in an appearance on Fox. \u201cThe president was not aware about this meeting, did not participate in this meeting,\u201d said Mr. Sekulow on             CBS.Shortly after the younger Mr. Trump began exchanging emails about setting up the meeting in which he believed he would receive damaging information on Mrs. Clinton from the Russian government, but before the meeting took place, the elder Mr. Trump announced he would soon give a campaign speech promising \u201cmajor\u201d news on Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump never gave the speech, but the timing has raised questions of whether Mr. Trump knew about his son\u2019s meeting.Michael Caputo, a former campaign adviser, said Donald Trump Jr. may have made a mistake but that the canceled speech proved nothing. \u201cThat\u2019s not the only speech that he talked about that did not happen,\u201d he said on ABC.In a series of statements on Twitter\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0morning, Mr. Trump expressed unhappiness over the continued focus on the Russia investigation. He asked why there wasn\u2019t more attention on his defeated opponent, Mrs. Clinton, and why instead \u201cmy son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media.\u201dIn another statement, he thanked his former campaign adviser, Mr. Caputo, who told the House Intelligence Committee\u00a0on Friday\u00a0that he had no contact with the Russians and never heard of anyone in the campaign talking to Russians. \u201cThank you\u2026for saying so powerfully that there was no Russian collusion in our winning campaign,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter.Mr. Sekulow was asked repeatedly whether agreeing to the meeting with a lawyer described as a representative of a foreign government was a mistake, even if it wasn\u2019t illegal.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to do that in 20-20 hindsight, but not when you\u2019re in the middle of a campaign,\u201d said Mr. Sekulow on CNN. Of the younger Mr. Trump, he said on CBS, \u201cIf he had to do it all over again, there are things he would do differently.\u201dMr. Sekulow also said the meeting amounted to routine opposition research by political candidates in both parties. \u201cYou know that goes on in campaigns all the time,\u201d he said.Campaign veterans of both parties have strongly disputed that characterization and have said it isn\u2019t normal for candidates to accept or seek political assistance from foreign governments. If offered such help, \u201cI would respond in the negative, and I think most candidates would,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, in an appearance on CNN.Ms. Collins said she hoped the committee would be able to speak with the younger Mr. Trump and anyone who attended or was involved in setting up that meeting.The Federal Bureau of Investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller and several congressional committees are probing Russian meddling in last fall\u2019s election and any potential coordination with the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion and called the probes a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dDemocrats said they were troubled by how the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s story had continued to change. Earlier this year, he denied any meetings with Russians. After the meeting was first reported, the younger Mr. Trump said it concerned revisiting a 2012 law to sanction Russian officials. Later, he posted emails showing the meeting also concerned obtaining information about Mrs. Clinton.\u201cThey can call it a witch hunt\u2026but, nonetheless, real evidence is coming forward that just can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d said Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, on ABC.\u201cDonald Trump Jr. did not tell the truth a variety of times,\u201d said Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), on CNN.Mr. Warner said the committee wanted to spend more time reviewing evidence before hearing from the younger Mr. Trump and other participants in the meeting. \u201cThese individuals don\u2019t seem to disclose everything or don\u2019t tell the whole truth until they have evidence put in front of them,\u201d he said.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-16 14:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawyer-for-president-says-no-laws-broken-when-trump-jr-agreed-to-meeting-1500230746", "news_title": "Lawyer for President Says No Laws Broken When Trump Jr. Agreed to Meeting", "keywords": "congress,fbi investigation,meddling,presidential election,russia,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "La Raza has decided to rebrand. The liberal political group announced last week that it would change its name from one suggestive of adversarial Chicano politics to something with broader appeal: UnidosUS. The shift appears to stem from a recognition of long-ignored social and financial transformations in the U.S.Since its inception in 1968, made possible in part by a grant from the Ford Foundation, La Raza has been far more dependent on boardrooms and government than grass-roots support. But with government largess drying up, the liberal political-advocacy group may find itself needing greater support from the rank and file. This won\u2019t be easy.The nation\u2019s \u201cHispanics\u201d are undergoing a radical shift that most politicians are missing: A white majority is likely to persist in America. \u201cMany children growing up today in mixed families are integrating into a still largely white mainstream society,\u201d sociologist       Richard Alba      noted in American Prospect last year. These children are \u201clikely to think of themselves as part of that mainstream, rather than as minorities excluded from it.\u201dThe name La Raza\u2014\u201cthe race\u201d in Spanish\u2014flies in the face of this reality. It is off-putting to many \u201cHispanics,\u201d an artificial Census category comprising many razas. The organization\u2019s CEO,       Janet Murguia,        admitted as much in a video announcing the name change: \u201cWe must make sure that our name and our organization evolves along with and remains relevant to our ever changing Hispanic community.\u201dAppealing to a broader swath of this diverse group is necessary now that the \u201cfat years\u201d under President Obama are gone. The Obama Justice Department made a practice of settling lawsuits against corporate defendants by requiring they make large donations to groups like La Raza. It was, in the words of House Judiciary Committee Chairman       Bob Goodlatte,        \u201ca scheme to funnel money to politically favored special interest groups.\u201d In a letter sent to Attorney General       Loretta Lynch       in the closing days of the Obama administration, Mr. Goodlatte noted that \u201cin just the last two years, DOJ has directed nearly $1 billion to activist groups, entirely outside of Congress\u2019s spending and oversight authority.\u201dTaxpayer money was flowing into La Raza coffers too. When       Cecilia Munoz,        a top La Raza lobbyist, joined Mr. Obama\u2019s Domestic Policy Council, federal subsidies for La Raza went from $4.1 million to $11 million a year. And La Raza loyally promoted Mr. Obama\u2019s policies as pro-Latino. You can expect the group to continue agitating on behalf of the Democratic Party.Whether UnidosUS becomes more grass-roots-driven than La Raza remains to be seen. The group\u2019s corporate board of advisers still includes             Comcast,AT&T,Bank of America,Chevron,Coca-Cola,       Ford, Con-Agra Foods and other Fortune 500 firms. Its more than 260 local affiliates train and mobilize an activist core of community organizers but have only a third of the vote on the board.This week\u2019s name change may be a recognition of an imperfect model.

I took five years of French and can\u2019t even talk to a French poodle.Maybe there\u2019s a better way for students to spend their time. Last month Apple CEO       Tim Cook       urged the president: \u201cCoding should be a requirement in every public school.\u201d I propose we do a swap.Why do American schools still require foreign languages? Translating at the United Nations is not a growth industry. In the 1960s and \u201970s everyone suggested studying German, as most scientific papers were in that language. Or at least that\u2019s what they told me. In the \u201980s it was Japanese, since they ruled manufacturing and would soon rule computers. In the \u201990s a fountain of wealth was supposed to spout from post-Communist Moscow, so we all needed to learn Russian. Now parents elbow each other getting their children into immersive Mandarin programs starting in kindergarten.Don\u2019t they know that the Tower of Babel has been torn down? On your average smartphone, apps like Google Translate can do real-time voice translation. No one ever has to say worthless phrases like la plume de ma tante anymore. The app Waygo lets you point your phone at signs in Chinese, Japanese or Korean and get translations in English. Sometime in the next few years you\u2019ll be able to buy a Bluetooth-based universal translator for your ear.Yet students still need to take at least two years of foreign-language classes in high school to attend most four-year colleges. Three if they want to impress the admissions officer. Four if they\u2019re masochists. Then they need to show language competency to graduate most liberal-arts programs. We tried to get my son out of a college language requirement. He pointed to his computer skills and argued that the internet is in English. (It\u2019s true. As of March, 51.6% of websites were in English. Just 2% were Chinese.) We lost the argument. He took Japanese and has fun ordering sushi.It\u2019s not as if learning another language comes with a big payday. In 2002 the Federal Reserve and Harvard put out a study showing those who speak a foreign language earn 2% more than those who don\u2019t.High schools tend to follow colleges\u2019 lead, but maybe that\u2019s beginning to change.

Foolishly, the Common Core state standards are silent on coding.The U.S. is falling behind. In 2014 England made computing a part of its national primary curriculum. Estonia had already started coding in its schools as early as first grade. The Netherlands, Belgium and Finland also have national programs.Maybe the U.S. can start the ball rolling by requiring colleges and high schools to allow computer languages to count as foreign languages. A handful of high schools already teach the Java computer language using a free tool called BlueJ. Nonprofit Code.org exposes students to a visual programming language called Blockly. To compete in this dog-eat-dog world, America should offer Python and Ruby on Rails instead of French and Spanish.Knowledge is good. Great literature reshuffles the mind. Tough trigonometry problems provide puzzles for the brain. Yet there is no better challenge than writing code that teaches a machine to do exactly what you want.

Even I remember the French word for bogus.Let\u2019s face it, the world is headed toward one language anyway. The American-based Germanic-named Uber was originato at the Le Web conference in Paris. In Shanghai, I\u2019ve seen ads on trains and storefronts signs that read \u201cLearn Wall Street English.\u201dMr. Cook is right to want more coders, though a tad self-serving as Apple basically sells software wrapped in glass and metal. Same with Code.org, supported by Google and             Microsoft.       But every company requires coders.

First Class       Christopher Speer,        a U.S. Army Delta Force medic, on July 27, 2002. Those are the facts to which Mr. Khadr, a Canadian citizen, confessed when he pleaded guilty before a Guantanamo Bay war-crimes commission.For several years Mr. Khadr had been living and training with al Qaeda in Afghanistan under the tutelage of his father, Ahmed. The Khadrs reportedly lived in       Osama bin Laden\u2019s       Kandahar-area compound.Speer died of his wounds 1\u00bd weeks after the attack, which left another soldier, Sgt. First Class       Layne Morris,        partly blind. Mr. Khadr, badly wounded, was treated and transferred to the Cuba base. In 2012 the U.S. returned him to Canada to serve the remainder of his eight-year sentence.Mr. Khadr was just shy of his 16th birthday at the time of the attack. In 2010 Canada\u2019s Supreme Court held that the interrogation of Mr. Khadr at Guantanamo Bay by Canadians in 2003-04 violated Canadian standards for the treatment of detained youths. These violations occurred during the mandates of Liberal Prime Ministers       Jean Chr\u00e9tien       and       Paul Martin.       The Supreme Court left it to the government, then headed by Conservative Stephen Harper, to determine an appropriate remedy, and to the civil courts to rule on any damages.A few months later Mr. Khadr entered his guilty plea on five war-crimes charges. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison, reduced by pretrial agreement to eight years. The Harper government determined that returning Mr. Khadr to Canada would be the appropriate remedy. In 2012 he was repatriated to serve the remaining years of his sentence. He was released on bail in 2015.Mr. Khadr wasn\u2019t satisfied. He sued the Canadian government for 20 million Canadian dollars (about US$16 million at current exchange rates).Meanwhile in Utah, Sgt. Speer\u2019s widow, Tabitha, his two young children and Mr. Morris sued Mr. Khadr and received a judgment for $134.1 million in damages. Their goal was to preserve possible future action against Mr. Khadr\u2019s assets\u2014at the time a remote possibility.But last week Liberal Prime Minister Justin       Trudeau       issued a formal apology to Mr. Khadr and a massive cash settlement, though no court had ordered him to do so. Mr. Trudeau refuses to disclose the amount of the settlement, but leaked reports peg it at C$10.5 million. That\u2019s an extravagant sum in the Canadian justice system, which is much more restrained in awarding damages than U.S. courts.Mr. Trudeau knew there was an outstanding judgment against Mr. Khadr in Utah. An insider told the Canadian Press wire service that Ottawa rushed the payment to Mr. Khadr to dodge compliance with the Utah judgment. The Speer family and Mr. Morris had filed for an injunction June 8 to enforce the Utah judgment in Canada. The Trudeau government had the money out the door before their petition could be heard in court.Last week the Speer family filed an emergency injunction to freeze Mr. Khadr\u2019s assets. On Thursday an Ontario judge denied the request, describing it as \u201cextraordinary.\u201d Had Mr. Trudeau waited for a court ruling, the Speers\u2019 claims could have been adjudicated without extraordinary measures. The prime minister\u2019s choice thus undermined the Speer family\u2019s legal options.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s actions are an affront to the memory of Christopher Speer, to Tabitha Speer and her children, to Layne Morris, to our U.S. allies, and to all men and women in uniform.

In any case, as the Trump administration considers sending thousands more troops to Afghanistan and seeks Pakistan\u2019s help in bringing peace there, Islamabad looks set to be convulsed in a prolonged political crisis. The prospect of talks with foe India, a major plank of Mr. Sharif\u2019s agenda, could also sink further, according to analysts.Even if Mr. Sharif escapes immediate disqualification by the court, Pakistan faces the prospect of seeing a sitting prime minister on trial.

This is a vibrant society,\u201d said       Fawad Chaudhry,        a senior member of the opposition party led by       Imran Khan,        which brought the court case. \u201cThe debate here has moved on from whether to have democracy, to the quality of that democracy.\u201dHowever, Mr. Sharif\u2019s aides say that the judiciary, the media and opposition parties have merely been co-opted by the old Pakistan: the powerful military establishment which has repeatedly undermined and ousted civilian governments.\u201cThe establishment has taken over this case and turned it into a witch hunt,\u201d said       Daniyal Aziz,        a lawmaker with Mr. Sharif\u2019s Pakistan Muslim League-N party. \u201cTheir aim is to rig the 2018 election and get a hung parliament.\u201dMr. Sharif\u2019s party currently has a majority in parliament. With a cloud over Mr. Sharif, the next election looks likely to be more closely fought with Mr. Khan\u2019s party.\u201cThere are only two paths for Nawaz Sharif now: he can go in an orderly way, or he can go in chaos,\u201d said the opposition\u2019s Mr. Chaudhry.Mr. Sharif has rejected calls from the opposition for his resignation. \u201cShould I resign because a band of anti-democracy conspirators says so?\u201d Mr. Sharif told a cabinet meeting Thursday, according to his office. \u201cWe will not allow the journey of progress and development to be derailed. Pakistan paid a heavy price for such stunts in the past. This should stop.\u201dMr. Sharif has clashed repeatedly with the military, in particular over his outreach to India. Washington blames Pakistan\u2019s military for supporting the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, a charge it denies.Two of the six officials who carried out the investigation for the court came from the military. Maj. Gen.       Asif Ghafoor,        the military\u2019s chief spokesman, said the officers were provided for the probe at the court\u2019s request. \u201cThe army has no direct involvement in this,\u201d he said.Mr. Sharif warned that the advances under his government\u2014a pickup in economic growth, large-scale infrastructure building and a reduction in terrorism\u2014are in peril.Mr. Sharif\u2019s party has also asked why others aren\u2019t facing questions of corruption, including other politicians, generals and judges.The corruption allegations stem from the massive leak of documents from a Panamanian law firm last year that exposed the offshore assets of thousands of politicians, entrepreneurs and celebrities around the world. Among the disclosures was that some of Mr. Sharif\u2019s children, who are adults, own four apartments in London\u2019s Mayfair area.The Supreme Court has already expressed frustration that the Sharifs haven't been able to provide a \u201cmoney trail\u201d for the acquisition of the property.Mr. Sharif says his children, not him, were given the apartments in settlement of an old family business deal with a Qatari prince. He also says there is no proof of kickbacks or money laundering. The investigation report concluded that Mr. Sharif is \u201cmost likely\u201d the owner of the London apartments.Write to Saeed Shah at saeed.shah@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-16 14:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pakistan-set-to-open-hearings-in-sharif-case-1500229387", "news_title": "Pakistan Set to Open Hearings in Sharif Case", "keywords": " india-pakistan relations,pakistan, pakistan military, pakistan politics, pakistan supreme court,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility openings,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,financial crime,fraud,politics,international relations,domestic politics,tax fraud,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "Politics is a team sport, and Republicans are playing it poorly. They have one more chance in the Senate to repeal and replace ObamaCare\u2014possibly their last hope for a victory.Democrats are performing like a well-coached team. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has all 48 members of his caucus on board with saving ObamaCare at all cost. It\u2019s been a successful strategy.It works for one reason: Republicans are divided. Their 52-48 majority in the Senate means they can lose two votes and still prevail, since Vice President       Mike Pence       is the tiebreaker. After promising to get rid of ObamaCare for the past seven years, it shouldn\u2019t be difficult.But as many as eight Republican senators opposed the first GOP bill, forcing Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to come up with a revised version. While an improvement, it has encountered opposition too. Mr. McConnell is skillful in bringing senators together. But here his task is more difficult than usual because the dissidents don\u2019t all agree on what\u2019s wrong with the bill. Appeasing one senator may alienate another.This is an example of why legislative success depends on operating as a team. You don\u2019t abandon your team just because you don\u2019t get everything you want (or want left out). You hold your nose and vote for an imperfect measure, sometimes merely because it\u2019s politically beneficial and better than the alternative.This is especially true in dumping ObamaCare. The Republican alternative is a more free-market health-care system in which people can buy the insurance they want, not what government requires.Sticking with the team makes that possible. But too many Republicans aren\u2019t comfortable as team players. To them, it\u2019s shady and unprincipled to vote for something about which you have serious doubts. Democrats are more realistic and less persnickety, so they\u2019re better at uniting.The political consequences of failing to eliminate ObamaCare would be disastrous for Republicans next year. Midterm elections are always tough for the party that holds the White House. But reneging on the promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d would put Republican control of the House and even the Senate at risk.Worse, ObamaCare would be further entrenched with Republican help. If repeal fails, Mr. McConnell\u2019s Plan B is to compromise with Democrats to stabilize the health insurance marketplace and keep ObamaCare alive and kicking. He would have no other choice.When the voting begins, Republican senators need to ask themselves three questions: How would the result affect you? How would it affect your party? How would it affect the country?On the first question, if any Republican senator sees voting to uphold ObamaCare as politically safer, think again. Trying to reach across the aisle to protect Medicaid\u2019s rate of growth won\u2019t win you any new Democratic votes. But if you desert the GOP, the base won\u2019t forget or forgive. Republicans care passionately about ending ObamaCare. If you cross them on this vote, large numbers will cut you loose. There\u2019s private polling on this, by the way.The House Freedom Caucus learned this the hard way. In May, when its members blocked the first House health-care bill from going forward, they expected to be hailed as heroes. They weren\u2019t. When a second bill was offered, they did nothing to stop it. They got behind the team and it passed.If the Republican Party fumbles the Senate vote, it will suffer\u2014and will deserve to. Having made the death of ObamaCare its overriding concern, a GOP that fails to deliver would shatter its credibility. An important element of the Republican brand is its identity as the conservative party. Fewer would see it that way if ObamaCare survives. GOP voter turnout would fall, and the party\u2019s candidates would feel the difference.What about the country? It wouldn\u2019t benefit from making ObamaCare permanent. Health care would cost more and heal less. A political comeback by Democrats could lead to a single-payer system. Anyone who has experienced medical treatment at a Veterans Administration hospital would find the new system quite familiar.Sen.       Rand Paul       of Kentucky opposes the Senate bill because it leaves too much of ObamaCare in place. But the alternative is to leave all of it in place.Sen.       Dean Heller       of Nevada feels the bill\u2019s Medicaid reforms would hurt thousands of his state\u2019s residents and jeopardize his re-election in 2018. But preserving ObamaCare would hurt millions nationwide and his prospects for winning a second term.Sen.       Susan Collins       of Maine says the bill won\u2019t \u201cfix the flaws\u201d in ObamaCare. But the alternative would lock those flaws in place, probably forever.Messrs.

The partners then took to feuding, about matters ranging from helping fund new hotel developments to who should be chief executive. After a truce in 2013, they have been trying to whip their investment into shape.It has been no slam dunk, falling short of ambitious targets for new hotel developments. At the same time, the focus on fast growth has been causing some business partners and industry analysts to question whether standards and brand appeal can be maintained as Four Seasons hotels become more numerous.In buying Four Seasons, Mr. Gates and Prince al-Waleed were at the forefront of an investment trend. The superrich, often through structures called family offices, increasingly have been teaming up to acquire whole companies, planning to keep them long term.Family offices hold more than $4 trillion in assets, approaching the total invested in hedge funds and private-equity funds combined. The wealthy clans sometimes invest together because they consider themselves like-minded in being long-term investors. That doesn\u2019t guarantee an easy partnership, however, as evidenced in this deal, as it was described by former executives, current and former board members, business partners and industry observers familiar with events at Four Seasons.The first Four Seasons was a motor lodge in a rundown part of Toronto, opened in 1961 by       Isadore Sharp,        a son of Polish immigrants to Canada. By the time he began looking to sell the publicly traded company in 2006, Four Seasons was a renowned name in lodging, known for personalized service and top-of-the-line amenities.Rather than owning its hotels, Four Seasons forms partnerships with investors and developers, then keeps tight control by managing the properties. Four Seasons hotel owners include billionaires such as             Oracle Corp.       founder       Larry Ellison       and Beanie Baby mogul       Ty Warner.By 2006, Prince al-Waleed\u2019s investment firm, Kingdom Holding Co., already owned about 25% of Four Seasons stock as well as several Four Seasons hotels. Mr. Sharp consulted him about his sale plans. Prince al-Waleed recommended bringing in Mr. Gates\u2019s investment firm, Cascade Investment LLC, which also owned some Four Seasons shares.The three men agreed to a deal in which Cascade and Kingdom would each own 47.5% of the company, while Mr. Sharp would have the other 5% and remain chief executive for five years.The sale closed in early 2007, near the peak of the real-estate boom. The price, 47 times one measure of earnings, reflected the era\u2019s optimism, as well as projections that Four Seasons would continue to expand at an increasingly rapid pace.Better LodgingDaily room rates and occupancylevels for luxury hotels in the U.S.are at their highest\u00a0in 10 years.Occupancy rate100%9080", "news_time": "2017-07-16 13:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-vip-billionaires-teamed-up-to-run-luxury-hotels-its-been-a-slog-1500226911", "news_title": "Two VIP Billionaires Teamed Up to Run Luxury Hotels.

Many of these agreements resulted from shareholders filing a resolution. Some followed strong votes in the upper 20%, 30% and 40% range. A handful followed majority votes.Moreover, 305 companies have actually adopted some form of political disclosure according to the 2016 Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, a nonpartisan study we co-produced with the Wharton School. In addition, 111 companies have policies requiring board oversight of political spending and board committee review of company policy, political expenditures and trade association payments; 143 have placed some limits on political spending; and close to half of the S&P 500 has disclosed some level of payments to trade associations or told them not to use company payments for election-related purposes.This successful effort offers a prime example of how the proxy can be used to catalyze corporate change.Bruce F.

Companies want to hear shareholders\u2019 views on significant corporate governance matters, but it doesn\u2019t make sense to allow the repeated resubmission of proposals that are opposed by up to 90% of investors.The distraction and expense posed by fringe-issue shareholders can be solved by a common-sense modernization of SEC Rule 14a-8 to require resubmitted proposals to earn greater support each year\u2014up to 30% after three times on the ballot.

I know this because I spent more than three years working on this pact.The four oversight board members who voted against the deal wrote in an American Enterprise Institute op-ed that Puerto Rico needs to focus on \u201creforming Prepa\u2019s operations, not merely restructuring its credit.\u201d We couldn\u2019t agree more.It\u2019s true the agreement wouldn\u2019t have directly prescribed operational changes or immediately privatized Prepa. As creditors, that isn\u2019t our role. Instead, it would have given the utility and its stakeholders more than $2 billion in capital, providing flexibility to make these decisions themselves. Our goal was to address the financial issues at Prepa since no third party will be willing to invest hundreds of millions in Prepa\u2019s revitalization while it is battling creditors in court. Importantly, we agreed to this consensual restructuring deal despite possessing what we believe are legally very strong underlying credit protections.We also disagree with the board\u2019s assertion that the restructuring plan would ultimately raise electricity rates. The reality is that the only way to ensure lower rates over the long term is by investing in Prepa to make it an efficient, modern utility.The deal Prepa reached with creditors in 2015 may not have been the cure-all solution for Puerto Rico\u2019s economic crisis.

But Mr. Chavern misses a key point. American antitrust law exists to protect consumers, not existing competitors from new competition.Google and Facebook have challenged newspapers by providing a service (advertising sales) at a lower cost and in a superior fashion than newspapers, their competition. Mr. Chavern proposes creating a cartel as a solution, which would effectively raise prices for consumers (advertising buyers). This is expressly what antitrust laws exist to prevent.Google and Facebook aren\u2019t engaging in anticompetitive conduct. They provide vast amounts of valuable services free to billions of people, and their paid services are cheaper and superior than those offered by their competitors.If Mr. Chavern doesn\u2019t like that, his industry is free to compete with them the old-fashioned way by seeking to provide a better product at a competitive or cheaper price.

European Council President Donald Tusk presented him with a copy of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, which the EU finally ratified last week, three years after it was first agreed to, having nearly been derailed last year by a referendum in the Netherlands. The agreement includes a free-trade pact that already has boosted exports to the EU by 25% since being provisionally applied on Jan. 1. Since May, Ukrainians have also been able to travel to the EU without a visa.The summit also marked a victory of sorts for the EU. To the surprise of many, the EU has managed to maintain a united front in its policy toward Ukraine and Russia throughout the recent political turmoil across the continent. It has stuck by a sanctions regime which may not have succeeded in persuading Russia to abandon its illegal annexation of Crimea or withdraw its support for separatists in the Donbas region of southeast Ukraine but at least has helped deter Russian aggression elsewhere in Europe and prevented a tide of refugees from Donbas that might have further tested European unity. In Eastern Europe in particular, where Ukraine\u2019s war is very much regarded as Europe\u2019s war, this is seen as an important success.Yet the warm words belied real anxieties. Kiev wanted the summit to end with a joint statement explicitly endorsing Ukraine\u2019s long-term aspiration to become an EU member. The EU\u2019s leadership wanted this, too. The Estonian government, which now holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency, pushed for a text that would welcome, acknowledge or even just take note of Ukraine\u2019s goal. But this was vetoed by the Dutch caretaker government, nervous of inflaming domestic opinion after last year\u2019s referendum rejecting the Association Agreement.Instead, Mr. Tusk merely read out the preamble to the agreement, which \u201cwelcomed\u201d Ukraine\u2019s \u201cEuropean choice,\u201d even though the European Council has stated that the agreement doesn\u2019t offer a path to EU membership in response to Dutch concerns.Does the EU\u2019s refusal to hold out the prospect of membership matter? In the short-term, perhaps not. All sides accept that it will be years\u2014decades\u2014 before Ukraine is ready to join given the vast challenge of overhauling its economy and institutions. In the meantime, Brussels is continuing to provide Kiev with technical and financial assistance to deepen its integration with the EU, while Kiev consults with Brussels on all reforms to maximize compliance with EU rules. In time, there is no obvious reason why Ukraine shouldn\u2019t participate in EU arrangements such as its single market, customs union or even its Schengen passport-free travel zone, which are open to non-EU countries such as Norway and Switzerland.Even so, the lack of a long-term EU perspective troubles Kiev. The Ukrainian government is trying to overhaul the country under challenging conditions. Following the Russian invasion in 2014, Ukraine\u2019s output slumped by nearly 17% and the currency lost 70% of its value against the dollar, causing inflation to hit 60%. That has created difficult political conditions under which to push through reforms such as the abolition of subsidized gas prices for businesses and households.Meanwhile, Russia appears determined to raise the cost of Ukraine\u2019s reform program. Its continued destabilization of the Donbas, where violence has increased this year, and repeated cyberattacks against the government discourage investment and add to pressures on public finances. Kiev believes Russian President       Vladimir Putin\u2019s       goal is to turn Ukraine into a failed state which will in turn destabilize the whole of the EU.Kiev has nevertheless chalked up important successes. It has nearly balanced the budget and has brought down inflation below 10%. The economy is growing again, and overhauls of the gas market, the banking system and public procurement have eased the pressure on government finances and reduced opportunities for corruption. Other much-needed reforms are in the pipeline, including decentralization of the public administration, overhauls of pensions and health care and land reform. Even so, every reform runs into resistance from vested interests, including Ukraine\u2019s powerful oligarchs. The government\u2019s capacity to implement its reforms is also weak, reflecting a public administration stripped of talent and still wedded to Soviet-era rule books. And while Kiev has created six new institutions to tackle corruption, there is no dedicated anticorruption court and there have been no high-profile convictions.To maximize Kiev\u2019s chances of success, the EU needs to find ways to lower the political cost of Ukraine\u2019s reforms. Kiev believes that offering a clear path to EU membership would strengthen its hand at home. Estonia will try again to convince EU leaders to send this signal at another summit in November.

He\u2019s going to walk into the U.S. Open in late August as the favorite. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s not technically the No. 1 seed. Roger Federer will be the undisputed pick to win the men\u2019s title, which would be his third Slam out of four this year.I believe the proper term for this is: Bonkerstown.New York City is going to be utterly out of its mind. Of course, New York has long been out of its mind about Federer\u2014he may have an aristocrat\u2019s mien, but they treat him like he was born in a walk-up in Brooklyn. It\u2019s like this everywhere he plays. Seeing Federer has become a sport\u2019s obsessive\u2019s pilgrimage, like seeing a religious icon, or the Grateful Dead.I think the arid stretch of no-Slams made the public\u2019s affection even crazier. Early in Federer\u2019s career, he was so dominant, it was as if he was superhuman or ethereal\u2014tennis heaven in a bandanna. Losing\u2014and sometimes heartbreakingly so\u2014added a new layer: vulnerability. Federer was still one of the greatest players in the game, but he was human, just like us. He suffered, just like us.I\u2019m a liar if I say I saw this coming. I thought it was possible that Federer could sneak a Slam somewhere down the line\u2014the man was making Slam semis and finals, still\u2014but not this. The door had closed on a stretch of dominance like what we\u2019ve seen in 2017, I thought. There was Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray and too much new talent and fresh legs. Every tick of the clock brought Federer closer to mortality.Then came Federer\u2019s injuries in 2016 and his dramatic shutdown, skipping the Olympics and the U.S. Open. If it wasn\u2019t the end, it sure looked like the start of it.I know the skeptics would want a few words about Federer\u2019s good fortune here, about how he\u2019s benefited from volatile stretches by Djokovic and Murray, not to mention Cilic\u2019s unraveling Sunday. Djokovic, a Federer soul-crusher in recent years, seems especially lost. The next generation of Slam champions, meanwhile, has yet to materialize. The young guns still play Federer scared.But you can\u2019t win two Slams in a season on luck. It\u2019s just not the way this works. It\u2019s too hard.Federer\u2019s done some clever re-envisioning here, too. My Journal colleague Matthew Futterman wrote recently about how Federer is the latest aging athlete to take advantage of an old, under-appreciated trick: rest. It\u2019s risky to stop and start in a sport like tennis, but time off has unequivocally helped Federer. It made him fresh in Australia, and after skipping the clay court season and the French Open, he was more than ready for the grass at Wimbledon.(I imagine there are some among us who are having a moment of What if? about Federer and the French. Could he have won at Roland Garros? Had he done it, he\u2019d now be on his way to a calendar Grand Slam. To this I can only say: No. Nobody was getting past Rafael Nadal in Paris. Federer made the smart call.)Just look at the man: technically a tennis geezer, but he\u2019s not playing like a geezer. He\u2019s bringing heat on his serve and from the baseline and he\u2019s outlasting younger competition on long rallies. He\u2019s moving so fluidly. His backhand return of serve is completely bananas, maybe better than ever. HE IS GOING TO BE 36 SOON AND DIDN\u2019T LOSE A SET AT WIMBLEDON.Skill isn\u2019t the only quality fans admire about Federer, of course. They also admire him because he stands for a kind of grace and class that is so hard to maintain over the course of a long career, not to mention the harsh spotlight of public life. Tennis is a sport of small courtesies; he\u2019s never forgotten that.I\u2019m sure there will be Federer fans who argue that, win or lose in New York, 2017 could be a perfect final chapter\u2014an all-timer\u2019s brilliant walk-off campaign. I get the notion, but I think this misses a fundamental truth about Federer: He loves playing tennis. He likes the practice, the life, the chase. The guy gets super up for playing random Masters tournaments. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ready to close the door.The U.S. Open is going to be nuts.

Its $180 million production budget is in line with costly competitors like \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming,\u201d but its production company, Paris-based             EuropaCorp,       is a fraction of the size of Hollywood\u2019s major players.A 3-D extravaganza that has been called a cross between \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cValerian\u201d will have to overcome a host of obstacles to turn a profit. Released in the most competitive part of the summer movie season, it is the only big budget movie that isn\u2019t based on characters or franchises already well known to audiences. There is also the foreign nature of the name itself, \u201cValerian,\u201d based on a French comic book. \u201cTo a U.S. audience, that is an unfamiliar name,\u201d acknowledges EuropaCorp Chief Executive       Marc Shmuger.Though early footage of the film has set science-fiction blogs abuzz, reviews so far have been mixed, with some critics praising the movie\u2019s kaleidoscopic visuals but saying its stars Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne are miscast in the lead roles.The film has become a case study in whether a globally ambitious movie from outside Hollywood\u2019s main studios can perform well in the current environment dominated by franchise films.A hit would transform EuropaCorp, a small studio founded by \u201cValerian\u201d director       Luc Besson       in 2000. Mr. Besson, a favorite among the Comic Con crowd because of the science-fiction classic \u201cThe Fifth Element,\u201d is one of the few directors working today whose reputation could justify such a massive undertaking without traditional studio support.\u201cThe first \u2018Star Wars\u2019 wasn\u2019t a franchise. \u2018Avatar\u2019 wasn\u2019t a franchise,\u201d said Mr. Besson. The movie marquee needs to have some fresh ideas from time to time, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s like never changing the water in the aquarium.\u201dSet in the 28th century, \u201cValerian\u201d imagines a universe where the Space Race never stopped, and sprawling colonies formed across galaxies. Alpha, where much of the movie takes place, is a cross-galaxy United Nations, like a metropolis populated by regulars of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d Mos Eisley cantina. Mr. DeHaan and Ms. Delevingne star as bickering crime fighters in this futuristic world, home to alternate dimensions, alien creatures and a shape-shifting cabaret performer named Bubble (Rihanna).Mr. Besson rose to fame with contemplative thrillers like \u201cLa Femme Nikita\u201d and \u201cL\u00e9on: The Professional\u201d in the 1990s before becoming known for his science-fiction epics. The director has a fervent fan base, but box-office analysts are skeptical U.S. moviegoers will show up in the droves needed for a film of this size. The director\u2019s last movie, \u201cLucy\u201d starring       Scarlett Johansson,        grossed $463 million world-wide, and EuropaCorp says it may consider sequels to \u201cValerian\u201d if its global haul lands above the $350 million range, which is plausible but far from certain.For EuropaCorp, the timing for a high-risk release comes at a precarious moment. The studio last month posted a loss of 119.9 million euros ($136 million) for the 2017 fiscal year. Though the company is open to building \u201cValerian\u201d into a sequel-spawning franchise, executives say they plan to primarily stick with their usual projects: Modestly budgeted action thrillers like the \u201cTaken\u201d and \u201cTransporter\u201d franchises that continue to make up the bulk of its release slate.Crafty financing has limited the company\u2019s risk on \u201cValerian.\u201d To raise the $180 million for the movie, Mr. Besson adopted a financing structure common with independent films, offsetting the cost of production by selling distribution rights in more than 65 countries and bringing on about a dozen equity partners. Ultimately, the patchwork of financing left EuropaCorp responsible for about 10% of the budget. \u201cFor the cost of a small to modest-sized film [for EuropaCorp], Luc was able to realize the largest production in the history of continental Europe,\u201d Mr. Shmuger said.\u201cValerian,\u201d a comic that Mr. Besson says he has obsessed over since childhood, has been the director\u2019s quixotic project for years. The 2009 blockbuster \u201cAvatar,\u201d with its computer-generated Na\u2019vi appearing alongside human actors, convinced him the technology had caught up with the storyboards in his head.The movie is expected to perform better overseas. French moviegoers are most excited for \u201cValerian,\u201d where the film is projected to gross between $50 million and $100 million, far above typical grosses in the relatively small market. The highest-grossing movie in that country this year made only $33.3 million, or about the opening-day gross for a hit like \u201cWonder Woman\u201d in the U.S.France was so eager to get on board with native son Mr. Besson that the country changed its tax-credit program after the director threatened to shoot the movie in Hungary. Tax rebates ultimately shaved $30 million from the movie\u2019s cost.Mr. Besson said he realizes asking audiences to go to movies featuring characters they don\u2019t know is a tall order in today\u2019s marketplace. \u201cI just wish people will take the risk,\u201d he said.Write to Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'The Most Expensive Indie Ever.'", "news_time": "2017-07-16 10:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-the-most-expensive-indie-movie-ever-break-even-1500202800", "news_title": "Can the Most Expensive Indie Movie Ever Break Even?", "keywords": "europacorp,luc besson,valerian,EuropaCorp,ECP.FR,FR:ECP,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,audiovisual production,media"}, {"content": "JAKARTA, Indonesia\u2014The co-founder of encrypted messaging app Telegram said Sunday that it will put together a team of moderators who are familiar with Indonesia\u2019s language and culture to remove terrorist-linked content after Indonesia\u2019s government limited access to the service and threatened a complete ban.The country\u2019s Ministry of Communications and Information Technology on Friday complained militants were using the app to recruit Indonesians and spread information on how to carry out terrorist attacks. It threatened to block Telegram entirely if it didn\u2019t introduce new measures to filter illegal content, despite an uproar from some users. It also asked internet service providers to block access to the web-based version of the service.\u201cThe government has long observed Telegram and we are a country that prioritizes the safety of our nation, our people,\u201d Indonesia\u2019s President Joko Widodo said Sunday.Pavel Durov,        who launched the app in 2013 with his brother Nikolai, wrote in a message to his followers on Telegram that he hadn\u2019t been aware of the Indonesian government\u2019s request to block several chat groups where Islamist radicals are active. He said Telegram had now blocked those chat groups, or channels, as they are known, and would take additional steps to respond to requests from authorities in Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim nation.\u201cWe are forming a dedicated team of moderators with knowledge of Indonesian culture and language to be able to process reports of terrorist-related content more quickly and accurately,\u201d Mr. Durov, a Russian national, said. \u201cTelegram is heavily encrypted and privacy-oriented, but we\u2019re no friends of terrorists\u2014in fact, every month we block thousands of ISIS-related public channels\u2026We\u2019re constantly striving to be more efficient at preventing terrorist propaganda, and are always open to ideas on how to get better at this.\u201dSecurity officials here have said that suspected militants detained by police have told them that they received instructions through the app, including orders from an Indonesian national with Islamic State in Syria, Bahrun Naim, who has been accused of masterminding several attacks in Indonesia over the past two years. Officials also have said that militants use the app to share instructions on how to make bombs.Governments around the region are stepping up efforts to disrupt Islamist radical groups after militants affiliated with Islamic State seized the city of Marawi in the southern Philippines nearly two months ago and are still holding parts of the town. The rebels there also used Telegram to prepare for the assault and publicize the attack.While other apps also provide a secure, encrypted messaging service, Telegram in addition provides the option to create open channels which are free for anyone to join. This has made a useful way to spread propaganda and recruit new militants.Rudiantara, the Communications Minister, said that the government had received an apology from Mr. Durov, and that he proposed several measures to tackle the way the app can be used to spread militant ideas.\u201cI appreciate the response from Pavel and the ministry will follow up the details on the technical side ASAP,\u201d Mr. Rudiantara, who uses one name, said in response to a question.Russian authorities also threatened to block Telegram in June unless it provided more information about the companies which own it. Mr. Durov said at the time he had no issue with providing corporate information, \u201cbut not a single byte of data will ever be shared with any government.\u201dOther countries, including the U.K. and Australia, have called on technology companies to do more to help security agencies tackle terrorist threats.\u2014Anita Rachman contributed to this articleWrite to James Hookway at james.hookway@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'App Aims To Curb Terrorist Content.'", "news_time": "2017-07-16 10:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/messaging-app-telegram-to-boost-efforts-to-remove-terror-linked-content-1500214488", "news_title": "Messaging App Telegram to Boost Efforts to Remove Terror-Linked Content", "keywords": "counterterrorism,messaging apps,terror,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,terrorism"}, {"content": "Netflix        NFLX 0.14%       investors can\u2019t seem to quit their favorite metric for measuring the company\u2019s success: net subscriber additions.

The market had been focused on subscriber net additions and U.S. segment margins.

Clearly, investors are still valuing the company on subscriber growth.In the second quarter, analysts are expecting Netflix to report 68% growth in earnings and 31% growth in revenue.

The combined market value of the four companies has increased by more than $500 billion since the start of the year, making them a major force behind the S&P 500\u2019s $1.7 trillion gain. They\u2019re also why most S&P sectors have struggled against the overall index.The total return of the S&P is 10.5% this year. Only three of its 11 sectors \u00a0have done better: technology (home to Apple, Alphabet and Facebook), consumer discretionary (home to Amazon) and health care.The S&P 500 Growth index, which holds the S&P 500 stocks with the fastest-growing sales and earnings, and the greatest price momentum, has returned 15.1%. Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook count for nearly a fifth of its weight. The S&P 500 Value index\u2014the yin to growth\u2019s yang\u2014has underperformed.Of the four behemoths, only Apple has a dividend, and a rather scant one. No surprise, then, that the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index, which screens for companies that have consistently increased their dividends, has done poorly. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index (which puts every stock on an equal footing rather than weighting by market size) has over time tended to outperform the S&P 500. But not this year. Midsize and small company shares, in both the growth and value categories, have also underperformed.So for almost any investors who adhered to any particular style, 2017 probably hasn\u2019t been so good. And unless they loaded up on the four stocks that happened to power the market higher, it hasn\u2019t been much of a year for stock pickers. The plain-vanilla strategy of just buying the S&P 500 has so far been the right one.But when the stock market is driven by just a handful of stocks, each of which is substantially more expensive on a price-earnings basis than they were at the start of the year, it can be setting itself up for trouble.

But changes in the international economy and the institutions governing trade are acting as constraints on what Mr. Trump can achieve.Gone are Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign threats to hit China with 45% tariffs and Mexico with 35% levies. Steel tariffs could come in a matter of days, but steel lobbyists worry they will be more limited in magnitude than similar actions taken in the past. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump\u2019s commerce secretary says talks to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, which commence in August, will be guided by the principle, \u201cDo no harm.\u201d\u201cThe interests of companies and sectors are making it very difficult to go through with the extreme (measures) Trump proposed,\u201d says Brandeis University trade economist Peter Petri, who is known for forecasting the economic impact of trade measures.During the campaign,             Goldman Sachs                   estimates, markets were betting that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies would lift tariffs by about 10 percentage points\u2014enough to jolt the global economy. Now Goldman estimates the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s more limited efforts at a 1 percentage point tariff increase. \u201cMarket expectations of major trade policy changes now appear to have completely reversed,\u201d Goldman economists Daan Struyven and Ben Snider write.Mr. Trump has taken the opposite approach of some White House predecessors. He threatens protection but so far has acted modestly. They praised free trade but pushed protection.Richard Nixon       imposed a 10% import surcharge to press trading partners to revalue their currencies.       Ronald Reagan       started more than a decade of pressure on Japan, whose imports battered U.S. industries, much as China\u2019s do today. He imposed stiff tariffs on Japanese electronics, and forced Japan to limit exports of cars to the U.S. and buy U.S. semiconductors. George H.W. Bush continued the semiconductor deal and pressed Japan to buy more U.S. auto parts.Even       Bill Clinton,        seen now as an avatar of free trade for his passage of Nafta and a deal that let China join the World Trade Organization, badgered Japan on cars, auto parts and computer chips throughout his first term. He threatened tariffs on luxury Japanese automobiles, calling off the levies at the last moment after Japan agreed to expand U.S. auto production.Later presidents had their protectionist moments too, with       George W. Bush       imposing tariffs on steel imports and       Barack Obama       singling out Chinese tire importsPast presidents used protection in part to give them domestic political cover to push for overall trade liberalization. From Nixon\u2019s term through the end of Clinton\u2019s, the U.S. negotiated two global trade pacts, Nafta and the creation of the WTO, among other international trade deals. Now those trade deals limit Mr. Trump\u2019s maneuvering room.Many of the unilateral actions that Mr. Reagan used to punish Japan now would be handled as trade cases at the WTO, which generally frowns on protection and takes years to make decisions. Deals to reserve parts of a foreign market for U.S. companies are forbidden by WTO rules\u2014although trade experts say such arrangements could still be used if they don\u2019t raise objections from other WTO members.Industries that once lobbied heavily for protection have become more international, making them less likely to push for restrictions.When the U.S. and Japan fought over Japanese car imports, for instance,\u00a0it may have made sense to put quotas on Japanese automobile imports. But that logic doesn\u2019t work for the U.S. and Mexico. U.S.-based car makers\u2014some of them Japanese owned\u2014ship parts both ways across the border to build a car cooperatively.The textile industry, long one of the most aggressive voices for trade protection, has become a defender of Nafta, because of how international the industry has become. The industry \u201csupports building on the successes of Nafta through seeking reasonable improvements,\u201d the National Council of Textile Organizations recently testified, \u201cbut not a cancellation, due to the high level of supply chain integration.\u201dOn steel tariffs, Mr. Trump is using a rationale, national security, that President Nixon cited as a reason for his across-the-board import surcharge. This time, the steel industry is asking the administration to use tariffs for a more limited objective\u2014to prod China to cut back its vast steel excess capacity. The administration, steel industry officials say, is looking at how to apply tariffs without prompting widespread retaliation.\u201cIf the steel consumers or the critics get their way, there is real possibility that the relief Trump will provide is smaller,\u201d than what occurred under erstwhile free-trade presidents, Mr. Obama and George W. Bush, said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a steel industry and labor group.None of this means that a new era of trade liberalization is at hand. It\u2019s been 23 years since the last global trade deal and none is on the horizon. Tariff cuts are slowing around the world, according to the International Monetary Fund, as are the number of free-trade deals being signed annually.\u00a0\u00a0But the architects who built the international trading system over the past half-century created a structure resistant to dramatic change.

Lee wanted to give consumers the weightless sensation of being underwater when they held the Galaxy S8, which hit shelves in April and is the South Korean tech giant\u2019s first premium device after last year\u2019s costly Galaxy Note 7 recall.The Galaxy S8 grew longer, slimmer and dropped most of the frame surrounding the display, for a sleek design many in the tech industry contend has bested         Apple Inc.\u2019s       iPhone\u2014some would say for the first time.Ten years after Apple launched the first iPhone, the smartphone war is shifting to how a phone looks and feels. Smartphone innovation has plateaued in the eyes of many consumers, who now see incremental changes instead of game-changing features, like a front-facing camera or a crisper-looking display, that they once lined up for.\u201cCompanies used to design phones to show off their technology,\u201d Mr. Lee, a 45-year-old executive, said in an interview, where he wore gold-colored sneakers and a Darth Vader T-shirt. \u201cNow the focus is on designing a product that can be a buddy to the person, inseparable to them,\u201d Mr. Lee said.Samsung, at least for now, is turning the tables on Apple with phone quality, Consumer Reports concluded when it ranked the Galaxy S handset the top smartphone on the market for the second straight year, with design earning praise alongside battery life and camera quality on the latest incarnation, the S8. Bragging rights matter more than ever as each company introduces fresh devices this year and vies for some of the record numbers of smartphone owners due for upgrades.Samsung has been putting more effort into creating a strong design culture. It has put the spotlight on Mr. Lee, who has the nickname \u201cMidas\u201d in South Korea yet is relatively unknown internationally, and who took over mobile design at Samsung in 2014. In contrast, Apple\u2019s Jony Ive continues to enjoy star status in industrial design circles.Apple declined to comment and didn\u2019t make Mr. Ive available for comment.How a smartphone looks now accounts for about half a consumer\u2019s purchase decision, with the assessment formed in roughly one second, according to Charles L. Mauro, president of MauroNewMedia, a product-design research firm that has done consulting work for Apple and Samsung. Mr. Mauro says peer-reviewed research reveals aesthetics matter much more than previously believed, as older surveys pegged looks as influencing only 7% of a phone purchase.Consumers are upgrading en masse: Global smartphone shipments rose 5.6% for the first three months of 2017 versus the year-earlier period\u2014representing the first sustained growth in two years, according to market researcher         IHS Markit.       The uptick comes as a large number of consumers who have held on to their smartphones for two years\u2014or more\u2014are looking to upgrade their device.Samsung says Galaxy S8 sales hit one million units in its home market in half the time it took for the prior year\u2019s model, the Galaxy S7, now Samsung\u2019s best-selling smartphone.The S8 is nudging the bar higher as Apple seeks to impress with its 10th anniversary iPhone this fall. For Apple to outdo Samsung on design, analysts said, it would need a new distinguishing feature, like a fingerprint sensor beneath the display rather than a physical home button.Apple pioneered modern smartphone design in 2007 with the original iPhone, popularizing the concept of the home button and the touch screen. Samsung distinguished itself by introducing a large 5.3-inch screen in 2011 and more recently by removing the horizontal frame around the Galaxy S8\u2019s display\u2014a change analysts expect the new iPhone to adopt later this year.Some design experts wonder if the Galaxy S8\u2019s visual leap says more about Apple and its chief executive,       Tim Cook,        whose operational skills contrast with the visionary talents of his predecessor, Steve Jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that Samsung has gotten better, but Apple has fundamentally changed,\u201d said Hugh Dubberly, a former Apple creative director and former member of Samsung\u2019s global design advisory board. \u201cThe pipeline that Steve [Jobs] started is over.\u201dApple didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Design has been a heated issue between the companies since 2011, when Apple filed suit against Samsung, accusing it of copying the iPhone and committing patent infringement\u2014and seeking damages representing all of the South Korean firm\u2019s smartphone profits at the time. The Supreme Court in December ruled that a lower court should reconsider how much money Samsung owes Apple for alleged patent infringement relating to the iPhone\u2019s design.Mr. Jobs made design central to Apple\u2019s identity at its formation in the 1970s, and he reinforced it upon his return to the company in 1997. Apple has given Mr. Ive and his design team a critical voice influencing everything from how loose an Apple Watch fits to how the company\u2019s Apple Pencil moves across an iPad.Samsung, traditionally known for semiconductor engineering and low-cost appliance manufacturing, began prioritizing design in 1996 under Chairman Lee Kun-hee. He believed design would be critical to product success in the 21st century. The company now employs 1,500 designers globally.\u201cWhat is unique about Samsung is they tried to institutionalize design,\u201d said Youngjin Yoo, an information-systems professor at Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, who has consulted with Samsung on design strategy.Another distinction between the two companies is that Samsung and its affiliates make many components in-house, rather than relying mostly on third-party suppliers, as Apple does.Mr. Lee said he had two design goals for the Galaxy S8\u2014to make the phone slimmer with a better grip, so it was easier to hold, and to extend the screen to the sides by removing the metal frames along the display\u2019s edges.\u201cBefore, it wasn\u2019t technically possible,\u201d Mr. Lee said. But the flexible organic light-emitting diodes, or OLED, displays that Samsung was making enabled his team to develop a phone with a screen that runs right to its outer edges with a slight curve. The result is a 5.8-inch display on the standard Galaxy S8 that is larger than the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus display, but contained in a narrower, smaller device.\u201cSmartphone design is not just artwork that expresses what you want but a process of making things people around the world can actually use,\u201d said Mr. Lee, who recalls how, as a 4-year-old, he drew pictures to tell his parents what he wanted to eat, because he hadn\u2019t yet learned to write.Appeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Samsung Stresses Design Gains.'", "news_time": "2017-07-16 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-apple-vs-samsung-became-a-smartphone-beauty-contest-1500210001", "news_title": "How Apple vs. Samsung Became a Smartphone Beauty Contest ", "keywords": "design,design guru,galaxy s8,galaxy s8 v iphone,galaxy s8 vs iphone,samsung,samsung head of design,smartphone,who designed the galaxy phone,Apple,AAPL,Samsung Electronics,005930.SE,political,general news,living,lifestyle,personal technology,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications equipment,mobile communications devices,personal electronics,audio,video equipment,cellular,mobile phones,consumer goods,construction,real estate,durable household products,handheld electronic devices,home electronics,appliances,smartphones,technology"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump\u2019s       political base is sticking with him, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, even as he struggles for legislative victories in Congress and as a federal probe expands into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election.In counties Mr. Trump won during the presidential election, 50% of adults approve of his job performance while 46% disapprove, the poll of 600 adults taken July 8-12 showed. In a nationwide Journal/NBC survey taken last month, the president had a 40% approval rating, while 55% disapproved.The new poll showed a significant split between the counties Mr. Trump easily won, and those that backed the Republican candidate after voting for President       Barack Obama,        a Democrat, in 2012. That divide showed that while Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest supporters remain solidly behind him, he is weaker in swing counties.In counties where Mr. Trump\u2019s election-day support was at least 20 percentage points higher than what Republican       Mitt Romney       drew in his 2012 White House bid, the president\u2019s approval rating is now 56%, 16 percentage points higher than his disapproval rating. In counties that voted for Mr. Obama in 2012 but supported Mr. Trump in the 2016 election, the president\u2019s approval is 44%, 7 percentage points lower than his disapproval.In nationwide polls, voters have soured on Mr. Trump, saying they have negative views of his temperament, trustworthiness and level of knowledge needed for the job. Asked last month about the source of his problems, half of adults said Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t have the competence and experience needed to change Washington.One of the biggest differences between all Americans and those in pro-Trump counties is among younger voters. In counties that backed Mr. Trump, 42% of voters ages 18-34 approve of Mr. Trump\u2019s job performance while 52% disapprove. That gap of 10 percentage points compares to a 44-point gap among the same group nationwide. In the same age bracket across the country, just 26% of young voters approve of Mr. Trump, while 70% disapprove.While he seeks his first\u00a0major legislative\u00a0victory on a health care overhaul, Mr. Trump\u2019s White House has been consumed by investigations into Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 election, and its possible coordination with the Trump campaign. The president has insisted there was no collusion.Last week, Senate and House intelligence committees said they would like to hear from the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., about a meeting he had with Russians during the campaign. The younger Mr. Trump met with several people, including a Russian lawyer and a former Soviet military service member, on\u00a0June 9\u00a0in Trump Tower. He said he initially was told the meeting would yield damaging information about his father\u2019s Democratic rival       Hillary Clinton.Participants, including the president\u2019s son, later said the discussion turned to Obama-era sanctions against Moscow that the Russians have been lobbying to see removed.Mr. Trump won the 2016 presidential election by flipping six states\u2014Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\u2014that Mr. Obama had won four years earlier. He also captured 220 counties that had voted for the Democratic candidate in the 2012 election.The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on telephone interviews in a broad cross-section of counties that Mr. Trump won during the election. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.Write to Michael C.

The firm raised and started investing money in 2013, when oil was trading at more than double the current price of about $45 a barrel. But the fund added $1.3 billion of borrowed money to boost its buying power. That later caused it trouble when oil prices tumbled.Now the fund\u2019s lenders, led by             Wells Fargo        WFC 0.26%       & Co., are negotiating to take control of the fund\u2019s assets to satisfy its debt, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201cWe are not proud of the result,\u201d       John Walker,        EnerVest\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, wrote in an email to The Wall Street Journal.The outcome will leave investors in the 2013 fund with, at most, pennies for every dollar they invested, the people said. At least one investor, the Orange County Employees Retirement System, already has marked its investment down to zero, according to a pension document.Though private-equity investments regularly flop, industry consultants and fund investors say this situation could mark the first time that a fund larger than $1 billion has lost essentially all of its value.EnerVest\u2019s collapse shows how debt taken on during the drilling boom continues to haunt energy investors three years after a glut of fuel sent prices spiraling down.At its onset, the oil bust was expected to cause widespread losses for private-equity investors. While most funds have been able to navigate the downturn and are hanging on for higher prices, there have been pockets of acute pain. EnerVest\u2019s struggles have been among the most severe.Only seven private-equity funds larger than $1 billion have ever lost money for investors, according to investment firm Cambridge Associates LLC. Among those of any size to end in the red, losses greater than 25% or so are almost unheard of, though there are several energy-focused funds in danger of doing so, according to public pension records.EnerVest has attempted to restructure the fund, as well as another raised in 2010 that has struggled with losses, to meet repayment demands from lenders who were themselves writing down the value of assets used as collateral, according to\u00a0public pension documents and people familiar with the efforts.Mr. Walker in an interview last year said he and his partners put $85 million of their own money toward satisfying the banks, but it wasn\u2019t enough.A number of prominent institutional investors are at risk of having their investments wiped out, including Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, Canada\u2019s second-largest pension, which invested more than $100 million. Florida\u2019s largest pension fund manager and the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Plan, a manager of retirement savings for union members in nearly 30 states, each invested $100 million, according to public records.The fund was popular among charitable organizations as well. The J. Paul Getty Trust, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur and Fletcher Jones foundations each invested millions in the fund, according to their tax filings.Michigan State University and a foundation that supports Arizona State University also have disclosed investments in the fund.None of these investors commented. It is possible some of them earlier sold their stakes in the fund, paring losses.In the earlier interview, Mr. Walker said the struggles of EnerVest\u2019s 2013 and 2010 funds had sparked ire among his investors: \u201cWe\u2019ve had some chew us out and hang up on us.\u201dEnerVest was launched in 1992 and says it operates more U.S. oil and gas wells than any other company. It started out investing for GE Capital,             General Electric Corp.\u2019s       finance arm. Eventually it began pooling other big investors\u2019 cash, which it used to buy producing oil and gas wells. EnerVest hunted for fields already producing oil and gas but neglected by big oil companies. Once EnerVest bought them, it made improvements and drilled more to increase output.The strategy isn\u2019t as risky as staking wildcatters or borrowing heavily to buy entire oil companies, but profits are usually lower. To juice returns, however, funds managed by EnerVest and rivals that shared the strategy borrowed money as if they themselves were oil companies, encumbering all of the funds\u2019 assets with the same debt.Doing that eliminates a key protection for private-equity investors, which generally finance each investment independently so that soured deals don\u2019t put good ones at risk. The use of fund-level debt effectively cross-collateralizes assets, meaning that good investments can be pulled down by bad ones.Institutional investors were drawn to these so-called resource funds because they typically pay out steady streams of cash as soon as they make their first investments, unlike other private-equity investments that can take years to bear fruit, said Christian Busken, who advises endowments and other big energy investors as director of real assets for Fund Evaluation Group LLC.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be something where you can be wiped out. But you are exposed to commodity prices,\u201d said Mr. Busken, who hasn\u2019t worked directly with EnerVest.EnerVest\u2019s funds historically returned more than 30% or so, which enabled it to raise progressively larger pools of cash. In 2010, it raised about $1.5 billion for its 12th fund and added $800 million of debt. Three years later it raised $2 billion for its next and borrowed $1.3 billion. The fund bought wells in the Texas Panhandle, Utah, outside Dallas and elsewhere, according to securities filings from some of the sellers. The purchases were made largely as U.S. oil prices hovered in the $100-a-barrel range and when natural-gas prices were higher.\u2014Andrea Fuller and Dawn Lim contributed to this article.Write to Ryan Dezember at ryan.dezember@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Oil Bets Doom Texas Private-Equity Fund.'", "news_time": "2017-07-16 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-2-billion-to-zero-a-private-equity-fund-goes-bust-in-the-oil-patch-1500210002", "news_title": "From $2 Billion to Zero: A Private-Equity Fund Goes Bust in the Oil Patch   ", "keywords": "$2 billion,enervest,oil prices,pe analysis,private equity fund,EnerVest,Wells Fargo,WFC,WFCL,John Walker,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,personal finance,retirement planning,commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,energy,banking,commercial banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,private pension funds,alternative investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,pension funds,public pension funds"}, {"content": "To understand the scale of the hacking attempts against election systems in the 2016 presidential election, consider South Carolina.On Election Day alone, there were nearly 150,000 attempts to penetrate the state\u2019s voter-registration system, according to a postelection report by the South Carolina State Election Commission.And South Carolina wasn\u2019t even a competitive state. If hackers were that persistent against a state that President       Donald Trump       won comfortably, with 54.9% of the vote, it suggests they may have targeted political swing states even more.In harder-fought Illinois, for instance, hackers were hitting the State Board of Elections \u201c5 times per second, 24 hours per day\u201d from late June until Aug. 12, 2016, when the attacks ceased for unknown reasons, according to an Aug. 26, 2016, report by the state\u2019s computer staff. Hackers ultimately accessed approximately 90,000 voter records, the State Board of Elections said.Unlike in Illinois, South Carolina didn\u2019t see evidence that any attempted penetration succeeded, said       Chris Whitmire,        the State Election Commission\u2019s director of public information and training, last week. Most of the attempted intrusions in that state likely came from automated computer bots, not thousands of individual hackers.\u201cSecurity has been a top priority for the [State Election Commission] since implementing the statewide voting system in 2004,\u201d Mr. Whitmire said about South Carolina.\u201cHowever, events leading up to the 2016 General Election, including the breaches of other states\u2019 voter-registration systems, created an election-security environment that was very different,\u201d he added.South Carolina\u2019s and Illinois\u2019s cases aren\u2019t unique, as many states faced virtual threats.There is evidence that 21 states were potentially targeted by hackers, said       Jeanette Manfra,        acting deputy undersecretary for cybersecurity and communications at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last month.There is consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 general election with the intent of helping Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Special counsel       Robert Mueller       and Congress are investigating whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow.Those hackers were at work months before some of their targets, and the American public, knew. The Democratic National Committee didn\u2019t kick out suspected Russian hackers for 11 months, until June 2016, according to a report issued by U.S. intelligence agencies. Also in June, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee learned that suspected Russian hackers had breached its network at least two months earlier. Russian President       Vladimir Putin       has denied any government role in either hack.In Illinois, the computer staff at the State Board of Elections noticed on July 12 that the activity of its server for the voter-registration database \u201chad spiked to 100% with no explanation,\u201d according to the state\u2019s report.The next day, Illinois took its voter-registration database and public-facing website offline for a week, but the hackers already had accessed roughly 90,000 voter records. No records were altered, according to the state\u2019s report, and the issue was resolved before Election Day. Those hackers haven\u2019t been identified, said       Ken Menzel,        general counsel for the Illinois State Board of Elections.The DNC, DCCC and Illinois breaches caught the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which on\u00a0Aug. 18\u00a0sent the first of two \u201cflash\u201d alerts\u00a0to state election officials, warning about attempts to hack election infrastructure. Also that week, the DHS offered cybersecurity help to election officials countrywide, with 33 states and 36 cities and counties ultimately accepting aid.In South Carolina, state election officials met with FBI and state law-enforcement officials, according to public meeting minutes from August.On\u00a0Sept. 6,       Marci Andino,        the state\u2019s executive director for elections,\u00a0requested assistance from the DHS, according to emails in documents provided to The Wall Street Journal by       Frank Heindel,        an activist who has advocated for improving South Carolina\u2019s election security for nearly a decade. The commission earlier this month disclosed about 1,200 pages of documents related to election security in response to a public-records request by Mr. Heindel.Also in early September, after meetings with its computer staff, South Carolina used an expedited process to hire Soteria, a private cybersecurity firm, Mr. Whitmire said. The South Carolina National Guard\u2019s cybersecurity specialists also conducted on-site security assessments at\u00a0county election offices, he said.To \u201canyone who was willing to help in 2016, we quickly said, \u2018Yes, we want your help and we want anything you can do to help,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Whitmire said.On\u00a0Sept. 18, DHS officials remotely completed an initial \u201ccyber-hygiene scan\u201d for South Carolina.\u00a0The scans examined the state agency\u2019s website and office network, checking for\u00a0vulnerabilities using a federally-maintained database. The scan didn\u2019t examine vote-tabulation machines, which aren\u2019t connected to the internet, or the statewide voter-registration database.The DHS discovered\u00a055 vulnerabilities\u2014the virtual equivalent of unlocked doors\u2014across four internet-connected devices used by the State Election Commission, according to a copy of the DHS report. Two of them were classified as \u201ccritical,\u201d the highest level of severity.\u201cThose are the vulnerabilities that can be translated into remote exploitation of the database,\u201d said       Curtis Dukes,        executive vice president of the nonprofit Center for Internet Security, which provides cybersecurity for private and public entities.The DHS reports don\u2019t indicate that hackers penetrated South Carolina\u2019s election systems. The type of scan that the DHS conducted is generally used to identify weak spots, rather than determine whether an intrusion occurred, said       Michelangelo Sidagni,        chief technology officer and co-founder of the cybersecurity firm NopSec.\u201cIt\u2019s like saying \u2018I\u2019m more susceptible to catch a cold,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mr. Sidagni, an expert on vulnerability assessments. \u201cWhen I actually catch the cold, that\u2019s the exploit.\u201dIf a hacker successfully exploited those vulnerabilities, he or she could have tampered with the agency\u2019s public-facing website,\u00a0and that \u201cwould severely damage our public\u2019s trust,\u201d Mr. Whitmire said.Voters can register online through the election site, which requires entering personal data, but the official voter-registration database isn\u2019t connected to the internet, Mr. Whitmire said. Voters\u2019 personal information must pass through multiple servers and checkpoints before being stored in the official database, he said.Even if the hackers penetrated the voter-registration database, officials could recover because backups are performed daily, Mr. Whitmire said. So, if the state identified a hack and could date its start, the state could go back to using a clean, older version of voter records. But the DNC and DCCC breaches indicate how difficult it is to recognize that hackers are inside a system, since a good deal of material was stolen before the breaches were discovered.In the week of Sept. 26, Soteria, the private cybersecurity firm, started its work on South Carolina\u2019s election system.Twenty-five days passed before the majority of the vulnerabilities, including the two most severe ones, were fixed, DHS reports show.\u201cI would tell you: up to three weeks to patch a vulnerability, that\u2019s too long,\u201d said Mr. Dukes, who was Director of the National Security Agency\u2019s Information Assurance Directorate until January.On Oct. 14, the FBI sent a second flash alert about hackers to state election officials. It included a list of 621 malicious internet addresses and technical indicators that the FBI had identified between April and October 2016, according to a newly disclosed copy of the document included in what Mr. Heindel provided.\u2018Events leading up to the 2016 General Election\u2026created an election-security environment that was very different.\u2019By Election Day, South Carolina had resolved all but one low-risk vulnerability, according to a DHS report dated\u00a0Nov. 8. Malicious actors, who haven\u2019t been identified, tried 149,832 times to find it, according to the South Carolina State Election Commission\u2019s report. Data on the number of hacking attempts in the days before Election Day\u2014or from the 2012 general election\u2014weren\u2019t included in the report and the commission declined a request for those numbers.Mr. Whitmire said the state saw no indication that it was targeted specifically, but the data show a potential correlation between the election and the virtual assault.While stray malware hits firewalls regularly, the number of subsequent attempted intrusions against the commission didn\u2019t match the amount observed on Election Day, according to the state\u2019s report, which listed the number of attempted penetrations on the second Tuesday of each month between November 2016 and April 2017.A month after Election Day, on Dec. 13, the number of hits dropped to 113,372. The attempted penetrations never again rose above 100,000, ultimately decreasing to just 44,754 attempts on April 11.Write to Alexa Corse at alexa.corse@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'South Carolina\u2019s Hacking Battle.'", "news_time": "2017-07-16 08:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-carolina-may-prove-a-microcosm-of-u-s-election-hacking-efforts-1500202806", "news_title": "South Carolina May Prove a Microcosm of U.S. Election Hacking Efforts", "keywords": "cyberattacks,cybercrimes,cyberhacking,cybersecurity,cyber security,donald trump,election 2016,election cyberattacks,election cybersecurity,election hacking,russian election hacking,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "When Cond\u00e9 Nast launched its video hub, the Scene, in July 2014, it envisioned a sophisticated website that would showcase content from such titles as Vogue, Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, with media partners that included ABC News.But the site offered so much choice that users found it more overwhelming than entertaining, and traffic eventually sank. Cond\u00e9 Nast didn\u2019t shut down the Scene; instead, it reoriented the platform as a vehicle to distribute videos on             Facebook        FB 0.79%       aimed at an 18- to 34-year-old audience, with the tagline \u201cvideos for women who get it.\u201d\u201cWe learned you can\u2019t be all things to all people and expect people to come to you,\u201d says       Dawn Ostroff,        president of Cond\u00e9 Nast Entertainment, which like Cond\u00e9 Nast is owned by closely held Advance Publications Inc.Cond\u00e9 Nast and other legacy magazine publishers are redoubling their efforts in online video after learning from their stumbles over the past few years. Those who tried unsuccessfully to build centralized, destination-websites for their brands are now more concerned with distributing their work on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat and MSN. Publishers are also plowing cash into in-house studios to increase production volume and quality, and they are getting more aggressive about developing TV series around their brands.As magazine print advertising revenue continues to weaken, video has become more critical. Advertisers are expected to spend $15.4 billion on video ads next year, according to eMarketer, up nearly threefold compared with 2014.\u201cIf they miss the video market, what\u2019s left?\u201d asks       Jon Hammond,        chief strategy officer for Galvanized LLC, a digital publisher and consultancy.At Cond\u00e9 Nast, traffic at the Scene and its related branded-video channels declined from a peak of 13.5 million unique visitors in October 2014 to 4.9 million unique visitors in June 2016, according to             comScore Inc.But the switch to publish and distribute stories on Facebook, mainly for young women, has worked. In May, the Scene attracted 98.3 million video views across Facebook, according to video analytics firm Tubular Labs\u2014nearly triple the 36.4 million online video views the Scene generated in October 2016.Cond\u00e9 Nast is also building up its long-form video. Its digital unit sold a behind-the-scenes sports series, \u201cLast Chance U,\u201d to             Netflix Inc.       in 2015 and is producing two major movies based on stories that appeared in Cond\u00e9 Nast magazines.Since late 2011, Cond\u00e9 Nast has invested between $50 million and $70 million in its video arm. Ms. Ostroff says the unit turned an operating profit in 2016.Relying on Facebook for distribution can be a double-edged sword, however, presenting risks when the social network tweaks its news feed algorithm. And tech giants are big competitors for video ad dollars in their own right, with Google\u2019s YouTube far and away the biggest player and Facebook ramping up its offerings.Time Inc.,        TIME 1.80%       like Cond\u00e9 Nast, created a centralized video destination called Daily Cut several years ago, but it never caught fire and is now in the process of being closed.The company is experimenting with different models to distribute its biggest brands on streaming-media platforms. The People/Entertainment Weekly Network\u2014a free streaming service that the company says has more than 1.6 million downloads as an app\u2014is advertiser-supported.       Ian Orefice,        Time Inc.\u2019s head of programming, said a free service was the best strategy in a crowded entertainment media space.Time Inc. will try to lure paying subscribers for the upcoming Sports Illustrated video service it expects to launch in the fourth quarter. Mr. Orefice believes passionate sports fans will be willing to pay for the service, even though it won\u2019t have live sports programming at launch. Instead, subscribers will get a blend of expert commentary, documentaries and swimsuit features. Time Inc. is still working on price points and distribution partners, he said.The publisher is learning how to program for a digital audience. Traditionally, Time Inc. would have treated its search for a new model for the next Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue as a closely guarded secret. Instead, this year the publisher live-streamed a three-day open casting call on Instagram, Mr. Orefice says. The company came up with the concept too late to sell advertising against the event.Time Inc. is also tapping its vault of intellectual property for long-form video projects. This August, ABC Entertainment will air a four-hour documentary about the life of Princess Diana, produced by Time Inc. At least three Time Inc. magazines will publish related stories about Princess Diana\u2019s legacy, Mr. Orefice says.\u201cPrincess Diana has been on the cover of People magazine more than anybody in the history of the magazine,\u201d he says.Spurred by the growing appetite for video, Hearst later this year will open a 26,000-square-foot video studio around the corner from Manhattan\u2019s Hearst Tower. It\u2019s also building a video-first health-and-wellness brand, expected to launch later this year, and developing a TV series with the FYI television lifestyle network around Delish, its video-first food brand.More so than rivals, Hearst has placed bets on other digital ventures. Its Entertainment & Syndication unit is a minority investor in youth-focused AwesomenessTV and, together with             Verizon Communications Inc.,       owns Complex Networks. Complex operates its own digital channels as well as creating short-form videos, distributed primarily on YouTube, and premium videos, mostly distributed on go90, Verizon\u2019s mobile-first video platform.Learning how to produce content tailored for each digital and social platform is essential, media executives say.\u201cThe lessons are: Start to move the organization towards a very different type of content creation; get very close to the places and rules where you distribute; and measure yourself ruthlessly around what people are watching,\u201d says       Troy Young,        president of Hearst Magazines Digital Media.Write to Jeffrey A.

That is all changing, with three new competitors\u2014from China, Russia and Canada\u2014rolling out their own entries into the so-called single-aisle market.Orders for these new jets are few for now, and the Russian and Chinese makers won\u2019t deliver planes for years. It is also uncertain how popular they will become.Boeing and Airbus, meanwhile, are selling plenty of their own tried and tested work horses in the category.Still, if even one of these new competing jets is a hit, it could threaten one of the most lucrative sectors for Boeing and Airbus.\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem buying Russian or Chinese aircraft,\u201d if a viable model emerges,       Akbar Al Baker,        chief executive of Qatar Airways, one of the world\u2019s biggest jet buyers, said recently.The sudden competition is unfamiliar for both jet makers, and it adds pressure on them as they face waning demand in other markets. Bigger, long-haul jets aren\u2019t selling nearly as well as single-aisle, or narrow-body, jets and both Boeing and Airbus have struggled recently with big cost overruns and delays for some of their military programs.The narrow-body market has been the industry\u2019s sweet spot for years. Large airlines and rapidly growing budget carriers love them for their size and fuel efficiency. At the Paris Air Show last month, Boeing introduced the latest and biggest version of its 737 Max, with 230 seats. Boeing has a backlog of over 3,600 orders for its 737 Max family of jets.Airbus, meanwhile, has sold more than 5,000 of its A320neo family, the competitor to the 737 Max. It started delivering them to customers last year.Amid that booming market, three new competitors have swept in: China flew its C919 narrow-body for the first time in early May. The Chinese jet, built by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp., known as Comac, has secured more than 500 orders, mainly from Chinese buyers. First delivery is expected around 2020. Comac didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Russia\u2019s MC-21, which can seat as many as 211 passengers, also made its maiden voyage in May. The aircraft is manufactured by             Irkut Corp.      , which says it has taken in 175 orders and will deliver its first in 2019 as it prepares for further tests.Canada\u2019s             Bombardier Inc.,       meanwhile, began delivering a 130-seat version of its CSeries plane in November. The CS300 competes with the smallest models of the Airbus and Boeing short-haul planes. It is already in service with two European airlines. Bombardier so far has 237 orders for the jet.Deutsche Lufthansa AG       and Air Baltic executives have praised the plane\u2019s low noise and fuel efficiency.\u201cThe interest level in the program continues to rise,\u201d said Bombardier\u2019s commercial-airplanes boss,       Fred Cromer.China and Russia have yet to win backing for their planes from big-name Western carriers. Many of those buyers aren\u2019t convinced the newcomers can in the near term provide the required globally available spare parts and repair services to keep operations humming.Meanwhile, other plane makers, such as Brazil\u2019s Embraer SA, have avoided going head-on against Boeing and Airbus and stuck to building smaller airliners.The Chinese jet might be the most significant threat to Airbus and Boeing. Its ambitions are underpinned by the government\u2019s long-term focus and deep pockets and a domestic airline market large enough to keep local aircraft production busy.\u201cAre they a threat in the next five to 10 years to Airbus and Boeing? Probably not,\u201d said Airbus\u2019s chief plane salesman,       John Leahy.\u201cIn 20 years, I think they will be one of the big three manufacturers of aircraft,\u201d Mr. Leahy added.China has also been working closely with U.S. and European suppliers. The C919 is powered by engines made by a consortium of             General Electric Co.       and France\u2019s Safran SA.             Honeywell International Inc.       and             Rockwell Collins Inc.       are also partners. Like Boeing and Airbus, the newcomers act as integrators of components made around the world.The Chinese plane still lags behind the performance of the newest Boeing and Airbus jetliners. It is projected to have a shorter range and be less fuel-efficient. But industry officials expect that to change.\u201cThe Chinese will drastically change the duopoly, but with the next aircraft, not the C919. With this one, they are going to learn,\u201d said       Jerome Rein,        partner at Boston Consulting Group.Boeing is moving some work completing aircraft to China to help maintain access to the rapidly expanding market. Airbus already assembles some of its single-aisle planes in Tianjin, near Beijing.\u201cOur team has to wake up every day to be mindful that competition evolves and evolves quickly and we have to stay ahead of it,\u201d said Boeing\u2019s commercial-airplanes boss,       Kevin McAllister.Boeing also has gone after rivals through litigation. The U.S., on Boeing\u2019s behalf, 13 years ago sued the European Union at the World Trade Organization for what it calls unfair European government support for Airbus. The case and a counterclaim remain under way.This year, Boeing challenged Bombardier\u2019s sales of a smaller version of the CSeries, the CS100, to             Delta Air Lines Inc.       at the U.S. International Trade Commission. It accuses the Canadian company of selling the plane below cost.Bombardier dismisses the accusation, saying that new planes are often heavily discounted. It also said that Boeing has no standing to challenge its deal for the 100-seat plane because the U.S. plane maker has no rival product. The U.S. review is continuing.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Boeing, Airbus Confront Crowded Skies.'", "news_time": "2017-07-16 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-jets-threaten-airbus-and-boeing-duopoly-1500202802", "news_title": "New Jets Threaten Airbus and Boeing Duopoly", "keywords": " airbus versus boeing,airliners, jetliners, narrowbody jets, single-aisle jets,Boeing,BA,Airbus,AIR.FR,FR:AIR,Embraer,EMBR3.BR,Commercial Aircraft,Bombardier,BBD.A.T,BBD.B.T,Delta Air Lines,DAL,General Electric,GE,IRKUT,IRKT.MZ,RU:IRKT,Deutsche Lufthansa,LHA.XE,XE:LHA,Rockwell Collins,COL,Airbus SE,SAFRAN,FR:SAF,Honeywell International,HON,Embraer S/A,ERJ,John Leahy,Kevin McAllister,Akbar Al Baker,Fred Cromer,Jerome Rein,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,aerospace products,parts,civil aircraft,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,aerospace,defense,air transport,industrial goods,packaging,transportation,logistics"}]
