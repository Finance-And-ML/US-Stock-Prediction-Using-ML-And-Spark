He gestured at one wavering GOP lawmaker, Dean Heller of Nevada, saying, \u201cHe wants to remain a senator, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d and warned lawmakers not to leave town in August without a deal.Senate Republican leaders conceded defeat earlier this week on their effort to roll back and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, but at Mr. Trump\u2019s urging, they dug in Wednesday for what is expected to be the final push. Senate Republicans said they were hoping to rustle up 50 votes for a third version of the bill.Mr. Trump, telling the senators they were \u201cvery close\u201d to a deal, signaled the White House would take a more aggressive role in wrangling the 50 votes need to pass the bill. The GOP president suggested that Republicans had it easy in voting for the 2010 law\u2019s repeal when his Democratic predecessor,       Barack Obama,        was in office because they knew he would veto it and there would be no consequences.\u201cI\u2019m ready to act, I have pen in hand, believe me, I\u2019m sitting in that office. You\u2019ve never had that before,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cFor seven years, you\u2019ve had an easy rap: \u2018We\u2019ll repeal, we\u2019ll replace, and he\u2019s never going to sign it.\u2019 \u201dGOP leaders\u2019 immediate challenge is mustering 50 Republican lawmakers to approve a procedural motion that would allow debate to begin on their health-care bill.Adding to the uncertainty, Sen.       John McCain\u2019s       office disclosed late Wednesday that the Arizona Republican has been diagnosed with a type of brain tumor known as a glioblastoma, and that the timing of his return to the Senate would depend on consultations with his medical team.GOP senators said Wednesday night that the indefinite absence of Mr. McCain made their quest to get 50 votes on the health-care bill harder. \u201cThat does complicate things,\u201d said Sen.       Pat Toomey       (R., Pa.).Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said after the White House lunch that a vote on that motion would happen next week, regardless of whether it was expected to pass, and that he had \u201cevery expectation\u201d of trying to eke out a bill with majority support after that.\u201cI want to disabuse any of you of the notion that we will not have that vote next week,\u201d       Mr. McConnell       said.GOP leaders hope that once debate begins and senators offer a variety of amendments, a majority will emerge for some version. Earlier this week, three Republicans\u2014Sens.       Susan Collins       of Maine,       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska and       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia\u2014said they would oppose the motion to proceed on a repeal-only bill. Unless one of them changes her mind, debate can\u2019t begin because Democrats are uniformly opposed.Among the amendments may be one to largely repeal the 2010 law without an immediate replacement. An estimate released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office found that such a move would leave 32 million more people uninsured and would double premiums by 2026, compared with current law. The measure would reduce federal deficits by $473 billion over the coming decade, the CBO estimated.About 20 GOP senators huddled for more than two hours Wednesday night, but it wasn\u2019t clear if they had gotten any closer to securing the needed 50 votes. \u201cHard to say,\u201d Mr. Toomey said upon leaving the meeting.White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus came to the meeting but was asked to stay in a room separate from the one where senators held their discussion because some lawmakers wanted to speak privately, an aide said.\u201cWe\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re among ourselves,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.)Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska), an opponent of the repeal-only plan, was noncommittal on her stance after the meeting. Ms. Capito, also an opponent of that approach, declined to comment on the meeting.The GOP currently holds 52 seats in the Senate, leaving it vulnerable to defections from conservatives, centrists or any senator with a home-state concern. Democrats have remained unified in their desire to preserve Mr. Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement.GOP leaders are faced in the days aheadwith finding ways to lure back at least some of the GOP senators who have said in recent days they couldn\u2019t support the latest version of a bill aimed at overhauling the nation\u2019s health-care system.Ms. Capito, for example, is among those who have protested the bill\u2019s cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor. The administration is pushing the notion of waivers for states to redesign their Medicaid programs, including more support for low-income people. Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) said Wednesday senators had discussed the idea at lunch.Ms. Murkowski has similar concerns as well as a broader worry about her state\u2019s fragile insurance market. Mr. Trump cited the current struggles of Alaska\u2019s insurance markets as a reason for her to take action.Another holdout, Sen.       Mike Lee       (R., Utah), spoke with the president Tuesday, and Mr. Trump appeared open to the changes the senator wants, a spokesman for Mr. Lee said. A White House aide said the administration is open to any provision that increases GOP support for the bill.Mr. Lee has been especially concerned about alterations that were made to a provision of the GOP bill written by Sen.       Ted Cruz       (R., Texas), which was designed to lower premiums by allowing insurers to sell cheaper, less-comprehensive plans than allowed under current law.Similarly, GOP leaders have said they could address some of the concerns of Sen.       Jerry Moran       (R., Kan.) that the bill could negatively affect his state.Before this week, the president had been less active in the negotiations in the Senate than he was in helping pass health-care legislation in the House.The question is whether his late intervention can turn the tide. Some Republicans have been quietly skeptical of the president\u2019s arm\u2019s-length approach to Senate negotiations, though others have said he has been smart to hold back.\u201cDo the tectonic plates break and begin to move?\u201d said Sen.       Bill Cassidy       (R., La.), after the meeting. \u201cI can tell you they weren\u2019t before that meeting. The fact that the president comes in and very much emphasizes the need for momentum can break those plates.\u201d\u201cWe are getting close -- the issues are narrowing,\u201d added Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), a conservative senator who has said his support for a GOP bill isn\u2019t guaranteed.\u201cThere is still a hope on behalf of the administration and a lot of senators too that we can get there,\u201d said Sen.       John Thune       (R., S.D.), a member of the chamber\u2019s leadership. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take one more shot at it.\u201dFor months, lobbyists, GOP strategists and White House officials have described the GOP health bill in vivid metaphors, ranging from the biblical resurrection of Lazarus to the bathtub scene in \u201cFatal Attraction,\u201d where an apparently vanquished villain roars back to life.Heading into this week, a senior White House official predicted, \u201cThis bill will have been declared dead once, and resurrected at least once.\u201d Officials also regularly cite the House\u2019s success in passing a health bill after legislation was initially pulled from the floor in March.Democrats, for their part, are seeking to use Mr. Trump\u2019s revival of the GOP push to draw fresh fuel for their campaigns.\u201cLike the armored and mummified White Walkers from Game of Thrones, Trumpcare is hard to kill,\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.) wrote Wednesday in a fundraising email. \u201cRepublicans continue reanimating their terrible bill to kick millions of Americans off of their health care\u2026 Chip in now and support my efforts to kill this bill once and for all!\u201dDemocrats also hammered senators such as Mr. Heller of Nevada and       Jeff Flake       of Arizona, who are facing re-election campaigns in 2018, over the prospect of Medicaid cuts.Among those warning of dire consequences if Republican senators don\u2019t repeal Obamacare is Republican National Committee chairwoman       Ronna McDaniel.       She wrote in an email to GOP donors and supporters Wednesday that \u201cwe could lose the midterm elections\u201d because \u201csome in the Senate are refusing to even put a simple repeal bill on [Mr. Trump\u2019s] desk.\u201dConservative groups also joined in, including the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political-action committee, whose head Ken Cuccinelli said Wednesday the group would hold Senate Republicans accountable if they failed to pass health-care legislation.In the Washington swamp decried by Mr. Trump, Mr. Cuccinelli said, \u201cMitch McConnell is the head alligator.\u201dSuch threats may have limited effect on some of the Republican dissenters. Ms. Collins and Ms. Capito don\u2019t face re-election until 2020, and Ms. Murkowski isn\u2019t up until 2022. Still, conservative activists said they hope to send a broader message to Republicans about the importance of sticking to their promises.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about these senators; it\u2019s about the state of the Republican party,\u201d said Rachael Slobodien, spokeswoman for the conservative Club for Growth. \u201cThis is a much bigger fight.\u201d\u2014Byron Tau, Siobhan Hughes and Janet Hook contributed to this article.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com, Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.comAppeared in the July 20, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Prods GOP to Reach Health Deal.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-senators-lunch-with-trump-over-health-bills-troubles-1500483205", "news_title": "Trump Implores GOP Senators to Come Together Over Troubled Health Bill", "news_time": "2017-07-19 22:26:00"}, {"keywords": "john mccain,mccain brain cancer ,mccain cancer,Mayo Clinic,John McCain,cancer,political,general news,chemotherapy,health,medical conditions,politics,international relations,domestic politics,medical treatments,procedures,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Sen.

Jeff Flake       (R., Ariz.) said on Twitter in a post in which he said he had spoken with Mr. McCain.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) issued a brief statement late Wednesday calling Mr. McCain, who was a POW during the Vietnam War, a hero to Senate Republicans and to the country.\u201cHe has never shied from a fight and I know that he will face this challenge with the same extraordinary courage that has characterized his life,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cWe all look forward to seeing this American hero again soon.\u201dWithout Mr. McCain, Senate Republicans would have an even slimmer majority in the chamber.

Mayer, chairman of neurology at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, said that \u201c80 to 90% of the time when we hear malignant brain tumor, this is the type. It is just a nasty, incurable disease.\u201dTreatments include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, Dr. Mayer said. Many of the people who have such cancer, he said, are able to get into a clinical trial that is searching for a cure.A large group of Senate Republicans learned of Mr. McCain\u2019s diagnosis while meeting Wednesday night about the health-care bill, leading to a moment of stunned silence, said Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.). Sen. James Lankford (R., Okla.) led the group in prayer, Mr. Hoeven said.President       Donald Trump       said in a statement that Mr. McCain \u201chas always been a fighter,\u201d and expressed hope that he would get well soon.Former President       Barack Obama,        who defeated Mr. McCain for the presidency in 2008, offered encouragement on Twitter.\u201cCancer doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s up against,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cGive it hell, John.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   A comment made by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was incorrectly attributed to Sen.

The Magnitsky Act is a 2012 U.S. law that punishes Russian officials accused of human-rights violations, and is named for Mr. Browder\u2019s lawyer, who died in a Russian jail in 2009.The testimony from the younger Mr. Trump and Mr. Manafort is expected to focus in part on an email chain Mr. Trump released last week showing he helped arrange a Trump Tower meeting to discuss allegedly damaging information about former Democratic presidential nominee       Hillary Clinton.       The meeting was also attended by Messrs. Kushner and Manafort.A Russian attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya, who also attended the meeting, has said she used the gathering to advocate against the Magnitsky Act.

Now Uncle Sam is going to get paid.Steven Cohen       is\u00a0one of many managers\u00a0preparing\u00a0to write\u00a0huge checks\u00a0in early 2018\u00a0due to\u00a0a crisis-era decision\u00a0to close\u00a0a tax loophole that long benefited\u00a0some of\u00a0Wall Street\u2019s wealthiest investors.The billionaire founder of SAC Capital Advisors LP\u00a0amassed deferred offshore income of more than $1 billion likely subject to\u00a0the\u00a0taxation, said people familiar with the matter.\u00a0Other hedge-fund managers facing personal tax bills of over $100 million include       David Einhorn       of Greenlight Capital Inc. and       Daniel Loeb       of\u00a0Third Point LLC, said people familiar.Total payments from all managers could amount to $25 billion, according to\u00a0a 2008\u00a0estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation. Some tax specialists say the bill could be even higher: $100 billion or more.This will likely mean a surge of tax revenue for Connecticut, historically the center of the hedge-fund industry. The state isn\u2019t yet sure how much it will reap, said a spokesman for the governor\u2019s budget office.\u201cAny projection would be too speculative to be reliable,\u201d the spokesman said.Hedge-fund\u00a0managers\u00a0are considering a variety of steps to raise cash or soften the tax blow. Some\u00a0will trim stakes in their funds to raise cash, says Brett Barth of hedge-fund investor BBR Partners LLC.Hedge funds often invest\u00a0through\u00a0vehicles\u00a0based inside and outside the U.S. They make money from their cut of 20% or more of trading profits.For decades, the Internal Revenue Service allowed managers of offshore funds to defer receipt of this compensation and both avoid an immediate tax bill and grow the savings tax-free. The IRS generally permits businesses to allow executives to defer compensation because such deferrals lower the firms\u2019 compensation costs, forcing them to pay higher taxes on profits. That offsets income taxes not immediately paid by employees.But this practice cost the Treasury income in the case of offshore hedge funds that don\u2019t pay any offsetting U.S. taxes.Managers\u00a0in some cases let those deferred trading fees compound\u00a0tax-free\u00a0for 10 years or longer.\u00a0Some also deferred management fees, even as\u00a0they amassed large fortunes from gains earned by their U.S.-based funds.\u201cThey kept rolling and rolling the money,\u201d says Richard Zarin, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP.The             New York Times                   in 2007 highlighted this loophole, and Congress overwhelmingly voted to close it the following year as a way of raising revenue and stabilizing the financial sector during the 2008 financial crisis. The change, part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of October 2008, was made in section 457A of the IRS code.The legislation gave managers a decade to pay taxes on money accumulated before the law changed. That deadline is now nine months away.The deferred fees\u00a0will be taxed at ordinary tax rates that can be close to 50% depending on where the managers live and work,\u00a0according to tax experts.\u201cThese are smart, aggressive people who don\u2019t want to pay more than they have to and writing a huge check can be quite demoralizing,\" said\u00a0Jonathan Brenner, a tax partner\u00a0at Caplin & Drysdale. \u201cMost recognize they\u2019ve had a good run and now have to pay the piper, though not after first asking six different ways if there\u2019s some silver bullet\u201d to eliminate or reduce the taxes.Mr. Cohen, who ran SAC Capital before it pleaded guilty to criminal insider-trading charges in 2013, is nearing a launch of a new firm to manage as much as $20 billion, The Wall Street Journal earlier reported.He has set that target, which would exceed the $16 billion managed at peak by SAC, partly because he wants to generate income to help pay the large tax bill, a person close to him said.Other\u00a0fund managers\u00a0are shifting headquarters to Florida to mitigate the tax impact, said a local official. Florida doesn\u2019t have a state income tax\u00a0on personal income.\u201cEven four or five years ago they saw this coming, they knew they\u2019d bring money back in and needed to be in a state with lower taxes,\u201d said       Kelly Smallridge,        president of the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County.Those moves are no guarantee of a smaller tax\u00a0bite\u00a0because states\u00a0generally examine where and when deferred compensation was earned, experts say.\u201cPeople have been banging on our doors since the provision was enacted looking for a solution and we still have clients coming in, but one hasn\u2019t been found,\u201d\u00a0says Mr. Brenner. \u201cEvery tax lawyer who touches hedge funds has had these kinds of calls\u2026there\u2019s\u00a0frustration among some clients that a solution has not been found.\u201dSome charities\u00a0say\u00a0managers anticipating a tax bite\u00a0are discussing donations\u2014to receive an immediate tax deduction\u2014rather than handing money to\u00a0the government.Other\u00a0managers are turning to charitable lead annuity trusts, said       Henry Bregstein,        an attorney at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP. These trusts give a donor an upfront deduction of 100% as well as the opportunity to transfer to heirs,\u00a0free of gift and estate tax,\u00a0the trust\u2019s remaining value at the term\u2019s end after making annual, fixed distributions to charities.Eileen Heisman, chief executive officer of National Philanthropic Trust says her organization is speaking to roughly 50 fund managers about establishing donor-advised funds by the end of year, three-times the usual pace. She attributes the increase to the looming tax bills.Such funds make grants to charities on behalf of donors after they contribute assets, enabling immediate tax deductions. Assets can be invested and grow tax-free even before the charities are chosen.Sometimes, these funds can be invested in the manager\u2019s own funds, with restrictions, Ms. Heisman says.\u201cThere\u2019s no way of knowing how much\u201d money will be paid in taxes or how much will be shifted to charitable organizations, says Ms. Heisman. \u201cBut we think it will be very large.\u201dWrite to Gregory Zuckerman at gregory.zuckerman@wsj.com and Rob Copeland at rob.copeland@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/loophole-closed-hedge-fund-managers-prepare-huge-tax-checks-1500543002", "news_title": "Loophole Closed: Hedge-Fund Managers Prepare Huge Tax Checks", "news_time": "2017-07-20 05:30:00"}, {"keywords": " earnings,economy,labor market, low income, minimum wage, pay,wages,economic performance,indicators,personal income,average earnings,economic news,political,general news,general labor issues", "content": "For the first time in years, pay for lowest-income Americans is rising faster than for other groups.Weekly pay for earners at the lowest 10th percentile of the wage scale rose at a faster rate last quarter, from a year earlier, than any other group measured by the Labor Department\u2014including those at the top of the income scales who earn five times as much.The shift for low-income workers\u2014including restaurant workers and retail cashiers\u2014who make about $10.75 an hour, is a sign that a tightening labor market is delivering better pay to workers who largely haven\u2019t shared in gains since the recession ended eight years ago, according to economists and government data. Last quarter marked the first time since late 2010 that this earning group\u2019s gains outpaced all others.Usual weekly earnings for workers ages 25 and older at the bottom of the pay scale rose 3.4% from a year earlier in the second quarter, according to analysis of newly released Labor Department data. That was stronger than median gain of 3.2% and the 3.1% improvement for workers at the 90th percentile, who earn more than nine in 10 other Americans. The percentage increases are based on a four-quarter average of earnings, to smooth out volatility in the data.Throughout much of the economic expansion that began in mid-2009, wage gains for the lowest-earning Americans trailed behind median wage gains and those of the highest earners. During 2015, top wage earners received about a 4% annual increase, while the annual raise for those in the bottom 10th percentile was near 1%.The recent improvement for low earners coincides with a downward trend in the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.4% last month, versus 4.9% a year earlier. The unemployment rate for those with less than a high-school education\u2014who make up much of the low-wage workforce\u2014fell even more sharply, to 6.4% last month from 7.5% a year earlier. Tighter labor supply in theory should push up wages.Usual weekly earnings is a different wage measure than the more broadly cited average hourly earnings figure reported in the jobs report each month. The jobs report showed average hourly earnings for hospitality workers, the lowest paid of 19 broad sectors tracked monthly, rose 4% in June from a year earlier, the second-strongest gain. The quarterly numbers, which tend to be volatile, are based on a survey of workers and include overtime pay, commissions and tips that might not be captured in the hourly figure.Average hourly earnings, which have been stuck near a 2.5% annual increase for most of the past year and a half, are based on a separate survey of private-sector employers.Wages have been rising swiftly in fields such as restaurants, amusements and gambling, said Jed Kolko, economist at job-search site Indeed. That is an indication that employers need to pay more to attract workers into those fields.\u201cIn a strengthened economy, people spend more on entertainment and eating out, raising demand for workers in those fields,\u201d he said.Those wage gains also at least partially reflect rising minimum wages in many states and cities. At the start of the year, the minimum wage increased in 19 states, and Maryland and Oregon raised their pay floors this month.Still, higher-earning Americans have fared much better during the expansion. Pay for workers in the 90th percentile has increased nearly 20% since mid-2009, better than the median gain of 16.3%. The 10th percentile worker fared worse, with pay improving 12.5%. That hasn\u2019t been enough to offset inflation during the past eight years.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see wage pressure at the two ends\u2014the high-skilled end and the low-skilled end,\u201d Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said in an interview this month. \u201cWhere the squeeze is still happening is the middle-skill jobs.\u201dHe said that could partially reflect new technologies emerging to supplant better-paid workers. For example, he said, sophisticated document-reading software is reducing law firms\u2019 need for armies of young associates to do the task.Since the recession ended, employment in legal services rose less than 1%. Employment at restaurants and bars is up 24%.Last year, the Wireless Zone, a chain of cellphone stores, raised base pay for workers at its company-owed locations to around $18 an hour, but cut back the bonus incentives it offered. As a result, the lowest-paid workers earn more, shrinking the gap between high and low earners. Average pay is little changed, said Dave Staszewski, executive vice president of the Rocky Hill, Conn.-based franchise. He said the change in pay structure was designed to attract scarce workers.He said \u200bthe strategy has been effective in attracting workers as these job seekers put a bigger emphasis on guaranteed salary rather than potential bonuses.However, some low-paid workers say the raises are still too small to make a difference. LaShawnda Obie, a Wendy\u2019s worker from Detroit, received a 40-cent increase to $8.90 an hour in January, when Michigan\u2019s minimum wage increased. That is a 4.7% raise\u2014but she said it isn\u2019t enough to support herself and two daughters.\u201cI still have to sacrifice,\u201d the 28-year-old said. \u201cMy kids need underwear and clothes, but I have to push that aside so I can pay rent.\u201dWrite to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/low-income-earners-see-weekly-pay-gain-faster-than-other-groups-1500543003", "news_title": "Low-Income Earners See Weekly Pay Gain Faster Than Other Groups", "news_time": "2017-07-20 05:30:00"}, {"keywords": " crown prince,saudi arabia, saudi royal family,political,general news,royal families,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets", "content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia\u2014After a wakeful night confined to a Mecca palace lounge, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef emerged into a marble-walled room the morning of June 21.The 57-year-old prince found a waiting crowd, cameras, a security guard with his hand on a gun\u2014and his cousin       Mohammed bin Salman,        31, the favored son of King Salman, newly installed as his successor as heir apparent and crown prince.An inside look at how the drama unfolded\u2014pieced together from interviews with people familiar with the royal court, including people aligned with each prince, and from videos of events\u2014shows the extent to which the Saudi shuffle was a power grab by a self-declared reformer.That June 21 morning, the older prince muttered a greeting to the younger, who approached in an ankle-length robe and red-and-white checked headdress, a video of the encounter shows. Mohammed bin Salman, known to many as \u201cMBS,\u201d knelt and kissed his older cousin\u2019s hand.At that point it would have been clear to Mohammed bin Nayef that his long career\u2014in which he had gained the trust of American intelligence officials and become a crucial figure in the U.S.-Saudi relationship\u2014was over, say people familiar with the royal court. \u201cWhen MBS kisses you,\u201d says one of these people, \u201cyou know something bad will happen.\u201dAfter the June 21 encounter between the two princes, the royal court announced Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s elevation. Mohammed bin Nayef disappeared from public view. He has been at his Jeddah palace with his movements restricted, say those people, overseen by guards loyal to Mohammed bin Salman.A royal-court official, in a written response to questions about the shuffle, said Mohammed bin Nayef was \u201cdeposed.\u201d\u201cThe reasons of his deposition are very confidential and no one has the right to disclose them,\u201d he said, adding that the decision to do so \u201cwas for the sake of the national interest.\u201d The former crown prince has daily visitors, he said, \u201cand has visited the king and the crown prince more than once.\u201dThe younger prince\u2019s ascent marks a reordering of power with profound implications for one of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most secretive countries. With King Salman ailing, the new crown prince could soon be in charge of one of the world\u2019s last remaining absolute monarchies, a kingdom that ranks among the planet\u2019s largest oil producers and importers of arms, and that uses its vast resources to boost its sway in the Middle East.Saudi Arabian succession is governed by a malleable set of rules and family customs, and involves input from a council of about 35 top princes representing descendants of the kingdom\u2019s founder. The June 21 move amounted to one faction\u2019s deposing of another, in the most jolting succession fight since King Saud was forced from the throne by his brothers 53 years ago.That has left some royal-court insiders concerned about further upheaval, worrying another group could plot a move, say some of the people familiar with the royal court. \u201cNow it\u2019s the precedent,\u201d one of them says.The royal-court official declined to make Mohammed bin Salman available for comment and said Mohammed bin Nayef declined to comment.Mohammed bin Salman in recent years has made bold promises of change, pledging to modernize and open Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy and culture. His plan focuses on listing shares in the state-owned oil company on a public exchange and investing the proceeds to diversify the economy. He has also taken an aggressive approach to foreign policy and has worked to form close ties with the Trump White House.His older cousin is a low-key official who has made relatively few public appearances and has followed a slow-moving approach to governance over the years. He had widespread support among older Saudi princes who have backed his more conservative approach to foreign affairs. Through his years of working on antiterrorism initiatives, he had longstanding relationships with career U.S. security officials who have sometimes been at odds with the current White House.Some Saudis and Saudi watchers have expressed hope that economic liberalization will lead to more political and cultural liberalization, and that Mohammed bin Salman will emerge as a force for such change. His planned economic overhaul includes a push to bring more women into the workforce and improve education levels.Discord between the two princes stretched back to 2015, in the early part of King Salman\u2019s reign, when he made Mohammed bin Nayef crown prince and installed his own son, Mohammed bin Salman, as deputy crown prince. King Salman\u2019s later moves to give his son power over foreign affairs, the military and the economy fueled speculation the king could move him up in the succession order.A debate over how to handle the confrontation with Qatar that began in June, over accusations by Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries that the Persian Gulf neighbor supported terrorism, among other factors, heightened the sense of urgency over the rift between the princes, say several of the people familiar with the royal court. The older wanted a diplomatic solution rather than economic coercion and threats of violence, say some of the people familiar with the royal court. The younger adopted a more hawkish stance, supporting the economic blockade of Qatar that prevailed and remains in place.\u201cMohammed bin Nayef did not oppose any measures taken against Qatar,\u201d the royal-court official said.King Salman\u2019s deteriorating health fed concerns in Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s camp that time was growing short, say some of the people familiar with the royal court. The young prince began to lobby his father to choose him as successor.\u201cThe King\u2019s health is excellent,\u201d the royal-court official said of the 81-year-old monarch. \u201cHe performs his daily, varied routines in an active and energetic manner. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the King is a King until death.\u201dThe royal court recorded a video in recent weeks in which the king says it is time for Mohammed bin Salman to become king, say several of the people familiar with the royal court. They say the unpublished video could be used upon the king\u2019s death or as a public abdication announcement.The royal-court official, without directly addressing the video, said: \u201cAny country that abandons its leader in his last days for a critical health condition is a country with no dignity and prestige.\u201dAs the young prince laid his plan, he notified the Trump administration. The week before the power shuffle, say several of the people familiar with the royal court, Mohammed bin Salman dispatched a young official named Turki al Sheikh to Washington.President Donald Trump had met Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh and Washington in recent months. Mr. al Sheikh, a poet and writer of patriotic songs with no foreign-policy experience, had been moved by Mohammed bin Salman recently to a prominent role in the royal court.On his June trip to Washington, Mr. al Sheikh notified the White House that Mohammed bin Salman was ready to oust his older cousin, say these people.A White House official, referring to the Saudi leadership change, said the U.S. government \u201csought not to intervene or to be seen as intervening in such a sensitive internal matter,\u201d and \u201cwe consistently stressed our desire to maintain cooperation\u201d with Saudi leadership.The royal-court official said: \u201cWith regard to Minister Turki Al-Sheikh, he did not meet any U.S. official at all. Neither the U.S. nor any other country has been directly or indirectly informed about the matter, for this is an absolute sovereign matter.\u201dMohammed bin Salman\u2019s plan began playing out soon after Mr. al Sheikh returned to Saudi Arabia, in a drama described to The Wall Street Journal by people familiar with the royal court.On June 20, Mohammed bin Nayef was getting ready for a relaxed Eid, the big celebration at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. He headed that night to the palace in Mecca for a routine gathering of senior officials.For months, he had known his cousin could move against him. Within the three weeks leading up to Eid, people close to Mohammed bin Nayef warned him that Mohammad bin Salman was likely preparing to oust him. But, Mohammed bin Nayef dismissed their concerns as conspiracy theories.Mohammed bin Nayef \u201cthought why do it now, because it was the last three days before Eid,\u201d says one of the people familiar with the royal court.Guards loyal to Mohammed bin Nayef were replaced by others loyal to Mohammed bin Salman. The royal-court official said this was normal procedure and that additional royal guards have been assigned to the older prince, adding that they don\u2019t control his movements.Mecca\u2019s black-and-white Al Safa palace looms about 10 stories over the Kabaa, Islam\u2019s holiest site. Videos show that when the king and his entourage are present, as they were June 20, its carpeted meeting rooms buzz with ministers, staffers and servers carrying trays of coffee to dignitaries in green velour armchairs.The crown prince wasn\u2019t set to arrive at the palace until nighttime, after Tarwieh prayers\u2014an hour when many gatherings of high-level officials happen in the scorching Saudi summer. After dark, Mohammed bin Nayef\u2019s motorcade set out for the palace through Mecca\u2019s busy streets.When he arrived at the palace that evening, he was told to proceed alone, without his security detail.\u201cOnce he went from one room to another they took the weapons, the phones, everything from everyone\u201d in his entourage, says one of the people familiar with the royal court.Guards ushered Mohammed bin Nayef upstairs, through the palace\u2019s flower-patterned hallways to a small lounge. They closed the doors, leaving him alone. It was close to midnight by then, and the crown prince wouldn\u2019t leave until morning.While Mohammed bin Nayef waited, Mohammed bin Salman had calls put out to members of the Allegiance Council, the group of about 35 sons and grandsons of the kingdom\u2019s founder who weigh in on leadership structure. They were told the king wanted Mohammed bin Salman to be crown prince and asked for their support. The Saudi government says 31 members approved.In that room, Mohammed bin Nayef was told of his fate: The kingdom\u2019s senior princes wanted his cousin as crown prince.Mohammed bin Nayef \u201cwas horrified,\u201d says one of the people familiar with the royal court. He was asked to sign a resignation letter and a pledge of loyalty to Mohammed bin Salman, this person says. The crown prince resisted.Over the next several hours, royal-court officials visited him, urging him to reconsider. An emissary from the king told him to sign the resignation letter or face serious consequences.Mohammed bin Nayef held firm. But by dawn he was exhausted. He knew there was no way out. He made the only compromise he could\u2014he agreed to give an oral pledge of allegiance.The royal-court official said: \u201cThe pledge of allegiance made to the Crown Prince was made willingly.\u201dIt was about 7 a.m. when Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s men let the crown prince out. Mohammed bin Nayef didn\u2019t expect to confront the man taking over his title immediately.After exiting the room, though, he was surprised to hear a crowd. He walked from the corridor to the marble-walled room and saw video cameras and photographers. A guard\u2014not one of his\u2014stood with his hand on a holstered gun, in what people familiar with the royal court\u2019s traditions say is a violation of protocol around the crown prince.Then he saw Mohammed bin Salman coming quickly toward him. There was the kiss and muttered pledge of allegiance.It took about 15 seconds. Then a guard wrapped a black cloak around Mohammed bin Nayef\u2019s shoulders and led him off to his Jeddah palace.Write to Justin Scheck at justin.scheck@wsj.com, Shane Harris at shane.harris@wsj.com and Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.comAppeared in the July 20, 2017, print edition as 'Saudi Royal Drama Was Sealed With a Kiss.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-saudi-prince-unseated-his-cousin-to-become-the-kingdoms-heir-apparent-1500473999", "news_title": "How a Saudi Prince Unseated His Cousin to Become the Kingdom\u2019s Heir Apparent", "news_time": "2017-07-19 10:20:00"}, {"keywords": "airlines,bargains,business,cash back,deals,gift cards,hotels,packages,rewards,travel,The Upside Travel Company,marketing,markets,pricing,sales promotions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,consumer deals,living,lifestyle,personal finance,consumer spending,budgeting,travel deals,machinery,agricultural machinery,restaurants,lodgings,scheduled passenger airlines,rental,leasing services,air transport,automotive,consumer services,industrial goods,leisure,arts,hospitality,transportation,logistics", "content": "Teresa Roebuck       booked three business trips in a month and got the flights, hotels\u2014and the $700 laptop computer\u2014she wanted. By booking through a new site called Upside Travel, the education consultant was rewarded with $1,000 in gift cards and still figures she saved money for her company.\u201cI felt like I was cheating,\u201d she says.Upside is the new venture from Priceline founder       Jay Walker       backed by some big names in finance and travel. It brings basics from vacation-oriented Priceline, such as unpublished discount prices bundled into one package, to higher-dollar business travel. It can be useful for well-heeled vacationers looking for bargains on first-class travel or flexible coach tickets, too.Upside, aimed mostly at self-employed and small-business travelers, gets discounted flexible fares and room rates from airlines and hotels. Since individual prices are hidden\u2014buyers see only one Upside package price\u2014competitors can\u2019t match the rates and discounts get targeted to bargain-hunters without broadly lowering prices.The package price is lower than published rates, so companies save money on their employees\u2019 travel expenses. But those published rates are higher than what Upside is paying the airline and hotel. That lets Upside rebate gift cards to travelers.Those cards arrive once the trip is completed. Customers select from more than 50 different national retailers and restaurants, or leave the money on account at Upside for future use.\u201cInterests are aligned. You\u2019re getting a share of the savings that you voluntarily make on behalf of your company,\u201d Mr. Walker says.There are drawbacks. Choice of airlines and hotels can be limited and hotels don\u2019t award loyalty points on Upside bookings. (Airlines do award miles.) There also may be cheaper airfares and hotel rates out there, but they\u2019re likely to carry so many restrictions, Upside figures they\u2019re not useful for business travelers.The arrangement works, Mr. Walker says, because business travelers want flexible bookings, which are more expensive, and airlines and hotels are willing to discount high-dollar rates to land business travelers. Upside has no use for the new category of Basic Economy fares that lack advance seat assignments, for example, or nonrefundable hotel commitments.\u201cWe\u2019re not here to save $22 on the Best Western,\u201d he says.New York to San FranciscoPhoto: BloombergNew York to San FranciscoPhoto: BloombergFare: American Airlines $1,642.41Hotel: Westin St. Francis $606 a night", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-perk-for-frugal-business-travelers-1500479744", "news_title": "A New Perk for Frugal Business Travelers", "news_time": "2017-07-19 11:55:00"}]
