If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Quarles would take a lead role in carrying out the Trump administration\u2019s goal of rethinking many financial regulations adopted during the Obama era.Mr. Quarles would also weigh in on monetary policy as one of seven members of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, now short-staffed with only four members. His views in that sphere could put him at odds with his new colleagues, notably because he has criticized the Fed\u2019s policy of keeping interest rates near zero for years following the financial crisis, and advocated for a monetary-policy rule, or formula, to guide rate decisions.The Fed board has three vacancies, and the White House hopes to offer two more nominees as soon as possible, the official said. The administration has also begun the search for the next Fed chairman, though Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t ruled out nominating Chairwoman Janet Yellen to a second term, to begin when her current term expires in February.Mr. Quarles has donated to Republican candidates for years and served in the Treasury Department in both Bush administrations, working on both international affairs and as undersecretary for domestic finance, a senior job that involves coordination with the many U.S. agencies that oversee the financial sector.He left the government in 2006 and was a managing director at the             Carlyle Group                   private-equity firm, investing in troubled banks. He is now managing director at Cynosure Group, a Utah investment firm.Mr. Quarles, in a March 2016 Wall Street Journal op-ed that he co-wrote, said he didn\u2019t support \u201carbitrarily taking an ax to big banks and irreparably damaging the economy.\u201d He endorsed a review of postcrisis regulations but warned that \u201cthe consequence of a dramatic increase in bank capital is an increase in the cost of bank credit.\u201dAnalysts and government officials have said nominating Mr. Quarles, an establishment Republican, would be a sign that the White House favors more incremental rather than radical changes to the Fed, an institution that has long engendered mistrust among the economic nationalists who backed Mr. Trump during his campaign last year.Mr. Trump\u2019s team has advocated a rethink of Wall Street rules but has few officials in place at financial regulatory agencies. If confirmed, Mr. Quarles would immediately take over the job of overseeing the Fed\u2019s regulatory staff, which supervises some of the largest U.S. financial firms including             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co.,             Bank of America Corp.       and             Citigroup Inc.He could push for changes in the way the Fed oversees those firms, but he couldn\u2019t change the rules on his own. For that, he would need the support of other members of the Fed\u2019s board and other agencies.The choice of Mr. Quarles \u201cshows that we\u2019re looking for a change to the heavy-handed approach to regulation from the prior administration,\u201d the White House official said Monday. Mr. Quarles, the official said, \u201chas a track record of working well with others to implement public policy.\u201dObama administration officials have said stricter curbs on financial risk-taking were warranted in the wake of the financial crisis.Mr. Quarles would find some familiar faces at the Fed. He has worked before with Fed governor       Jerome Powell,        who is now the point person on the Fed\u2019s regulatory efforts and also served in the George H.W. Bush administration and worked at Carlyle Group.Mr. Quarles is married to Hope Eccles, who is a relative of Marriner Eccles, the New Deal-era Fed chairman whose name is on the building where Mr. Quarles would have his office.Ms. Yellen is set to testify on Wednesday and Thursday on Capitol Hill, where she will likely be asked about Mr. Quarles and the Fed\u2019s agenda. In the past, she has said she is open to changing some bank rules but not what she regards as core changes adopted after the 2008 financial bailouts.Ms. Yellen has objected to proposals to require the Fed to use a mathematical monetary-policy rule, an approach popular among some conservatives who argue central banks have too much discretion and should be more accountable to the public.Mr. Quarles said in the 2016 op-ed that low-interest-rate policies have \u201cled to a rise in speculative positions\u201d across the financial system and that a monetary-policy rule would reduce the incentive for big banks and smaller firms to take dangerous risks.Mr. Quarles\u2019s path to the nomination illustrates a broader trend in which nominees across the executive branch have faced delays completing the traditional background clearance and screening process.Top White House officials had identified the vice chair post as a priority weeks after Mr. Trump\u2019s election last year, and after an extended search process, officials identified Mr. Quarles as their top pick in April. At the time, Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       had indicated a nominee for the post was imminent.The White House expected Mr. Quarles\u2019s nomination to receive broad Republican support. He needs a simple majority to be approved by the Senate, where Republicans control 52 out of 100 seats.The White House has also been considering economist Marvin Goodfriend to fill a second vacancy on the Fed board, according to people familiar with the matter. It isn\u2019t clear when his nomination might be announced and submitted to the Senate.The White House has been searching for a candidate with experience in small, locally focused community banks for the third opening, as a result of a law requiring that someone on the Fed board have experience in that industry.But finding a nominee has been difficult in part because of federal ethics rules that require Fed officials to divest of their interest in financial firms. Once a regulatory nominee is selected, the process for security and ethics reviews has been taking about two months.Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com, Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com and Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Trump to Appoint Fed Bank Regulator.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 23:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-appoint-randal-quarles-as-fed-bank-regulator-1499726715", "news_title": "Trump to Nominate Randal Quarles as Fed Bank Regulator", "keywords": "fed,fed board,federal reserve nomination,fed nomination,fed quarles,fed trump,fomc,pe people,quarles,trump fed,Federal Reserve,Donald Trump,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,monetary policy,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,treasury department,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Trump plans to nominate Randal Quarles, a fund manager and former Republican Treasury official, to be the Fed\u2019s point person for regulating big banks.The CFPB barred financial firms from requiring customers to use arbitration, setting off a showdown with the administration and congressional Republicans.China\u2019s Dalian Wanda is selling off most of its theme parks and hotels to pare a debt load that has drawn attention from regulators.Elliott Management is pursuing Oncor with a deal it says is better than a buyout by Berkshire Hathaway.Many oil investors say algorithmic trading is distorting the market, driving price moves inconsistent with fundamental trends.Abercrombie\u2019s efforts to sell itself have stalled, leaving the apparel retailer to continue trying to right its business on its own.A handful of investors have begun extending short-term loans to a Ford affiliate after a long hiatus.Rallying tech shares lifted the Nasdaq to its second straight session of gains.Newspaper publishers are calling on Congress to allow them to negotiate collectively with Google and Facebook.Appeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-10 23:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-news-business-finance-1499744879", "news_title": "What\u2019s News: Business & Finance", "keywords": "Dalian Wanda,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,page-one stories,news digests,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "Greece, Turkey and Britain have been Cyprus\u2019s guarantor powers since 1960.

U.S. officials have expressed a preference for collective action through the United Nations and support from China.The Justice Department, in a federal-court case that was partly unsealed last week, pointed to \u201coffshore U.S. dollar accounts\u201d associated with a network of five companies linked to Chinese national Chi Yupeng. That included one of the largest importers of North Korean goods into China, Dandong Zhicheng Metallic Material Co.Citing sources that included two North Korean defectors, the Justice Department said the so-called Chi Yupeng network hid transactions that helped finance North Korea\u2019s military and arms programs.That network isn\u2019t under U.S. sanctions, but analysts say it is a vital source of funds that can be choked off, in the same way the U.S. targeted another Chinese company late last year, Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Some of the nearly two-dozen Chinese banks that handled allegedly laundered money from Dangdong Hongxiang also could be targeted, analysts said. The company declined to comment at the time.China\u2019s Foreign Ministry didn\u2019t respond to a request to comment, and Mr. Chi and Dandong Zhicheng couldn\u2019t be reached.North Korea has resisted pressure for years, and many experts question whether this time would be any different. Pyongyang has become proficient at evading sanctions, U.S. officials say, including by disguising its international trade and financial entities through firms in China.The U.S. itself has almost no direct ties to North Korea after imposing wide-ranging bilateral sanctions in response to previous missile and nuclear tests.China, North Korea\u2019s chief trade partner, has resisted tightening the screws against its neighbor, concerned that it could provoke Pyongyang to lash out against America\u2019s allies in the region or precipitate a collapse of the regime that sparks a flood of refugees, analysts say. The status quo has also provided China a buffer against U.S. power in Asia.Since raising the pressure on North Korea requires targeting more Chinese firms, unilateral action risks fueling already strained tensions between Washington and Beijing. It could complicate Washington\u2019s efforts to expand access for U.S. companies into the world\u2019s most populous country and win Beijing\u2019s support on other international issues, such as on cyber security and resolving conflicts in the Middle East.The       George W. Bush       administration brought North Korea back to the negotiating table in 2007 after escalating sanctions, but the administration then softened pressure and Pyongyang resumed its nuclear-weapons program. The Obama administration sanctioned North Korea, but the effort failed to halt the program.U.S. officials say the stakes are greater after last week\u2019s missile launch revealed Pyongyang\u2019s ability to put Alaska within reach and that current efforts will be more stringent than in the past.Even before the July 4 launch, the Trump administration began trying to tighten sanctions to cut off \u201call illegal funds going to North Korea,\u201d Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       said just days before the test. \u201cWe will continue to look at these actions and continue to roll out sanctions.\u201dLate last month the U.S. Treasury said it would cut off China\u2019s Bank of Dandong from U.S. financial markets, saying North Korea was using bank accounts under false names and conducting transactions through banks in China, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Neither the Chinese Embassy in Washington nor the Bank of Dandong responded to requests for comment. The Treasury also added to its North Korea sanctions list two Chinese citizens accused of working for front companies designed to evade existing sanctions.Trump administration officials have warned that North Korea\u2019s latest missile test warranted an escalation in international pressure, seeking first collective action through the U.N. Security Council and urging Beijing to use its own powers as a close Pyongyang ally to stem cash flows there.\u201cThe United States is prepared to use the full range of our capabilities to defend ourselves and our allies,\u201d Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., told the Security Council last week. Ms. Haley said past sanctions have proved insufficient.U.S. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       said Friday that sanctions issued last week against Chinese entities are a measure of the administration\u2019s resolve but that he preferred that Beijing act on its own to curb North Korea financing.Mr. Tillerson said the U.S. would apply \u201ccalculated increases in pressure,\u201d but that there was a limit to the administration\u2019s \u201cstrategic patience.\u201dThe Trump administration asked China to take action against a list of nearly 10 Chinese companies and individuals to curb their trading with North Korea following President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago summit with Chinese leader       Xi Jinping       in April, senior U.S. officials said.But U.S. officials say they have been disappointed by Beijing\u2019s response. The topic will be a focus of high-level U.S.-China talks next week in Washington, Mr. Mnuchin said, adding that the two leaders discussed the issue in Germany this past weekend.Failure to act more aggressively could embolden Pyongyang and the entities that help finance the regime, said Bruce Klingner, a former Central Intelligence Agency deputy division chief covering North Korea now at the Heritage Foundation think tank.Many former U.S. diplomats, including       Juan Zarate,        the top sanctions diplomat in the Bush administration, say Washington must ratchet up the pressure on Chinese firms and banks. The U.S. has so far been wary of prodding Beijing too hard, given the wealth of other vital geopolitical issues on which the two powers cooperate, former U.S. officials and analysts said.North Korea\u2019s latest missile test changes the administration\u2019s calculus, said       Nicholas Eberstadt,        a North Korea security expert at the American Enterprise Institute. He expects the White House to accelerate its sanctions against Chinese firms.Sanctions experts say the Trump administration is looking to emulate the success of Iranian sanctions, which forced Tehran to the negotiating table and halt its nuclear weapons program.Analysts and senior officials from two previous administrations say existing sanctions against North Korea have been elementary compared with the thicket of actions applied against Iran by the Obama administration. That pushed Iran into recession and persuaded it to negotiate, although many foreign-policy experts question the effectiveness of the subsequent deal the U.S. reached with Iran.A central aim of the new strategy of freezing out a Chinese bank from the U.S. financial system is to chill transactions by other Chinese institutions. Access to U.S. financial markets and the dollar are critical for trade and finance around the globe. But for that effort to be perceived as credible, said Mr. Eberstadt, the administration will have to list other Chinese banks to instill broader fear.\u201cIf I wanted to send a message, I\u2019d probably send several postcards,\u201d Mr. Eberstadt said.But while enhanced pressure could complicate Washington\u2019s already difficult diplomatic relationship with Beijing, the administration can moderate the potential political fallout, analysts say. Many of the banks facilitating financing for North Korea are smaller Chinese banks. By carefully documenting how those firms are breaking U.S. money-laundering and other illicit finance laws, the administration can show China it is not going after the government, but criminal organizations, analysts said.\u201cNobody\u2019s sanctioning             Bank of China,       the overwhelming majority are smaller banks,\u201d said Bruce Bechtol, a former senior Defense Intelligence Agency officer specializing in northeast Asia. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to break the Chinese and it\u2019s not going to ruin economic ties with the U.S.\u201d\u2014Jeremy Page in Beijing contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   North Korea\u2019s leader is Kim Jong Un.

Tending the 1-acre oyster reef there is part of an effort to rehabilitate the New York-New Jersey harbor estuary.Since 2007, these oysters have been cared for by the NY/NJ Baykeeper, a group of \u201ccitizen guardians\u201d who work to preserve what they call the \u201cmost urban estuary on Earth.\u201dMonitoring costs are funded with donations to Baykeeper, Dr. Fitzgerald said, adding that it costs about $3,000-$4,000 annually to keep the project running. \u201cWe operate on a shoestring budget,\u201d she said.The Soundview Park reef is underwater most of the time. But on a recent morning in June, a low tide lifted the reef above the river, exposing a wriggling world of crabs, snails, worms, clams and oysters. Dr. Fitzgerald and her team pointed out developments and pulled creatures from the water, including crabs and oysters\u2014both dead and alive.Oysters are particularly beneficial creatures to have in New York waters. Each of the bivalve mollusks can filter between 20 and 50 gallons of water a day. Large reefs can help prevent flooding damage by offering natural shoreline protection, acting as a brake for waves during storm surges.This is one reason       Dorian Fulvio,        a volunteer and former disaster-recovery coordinator, joined Dr. Fitzgerald\u2019s team this year. After seeing the devastation left behind by superstorm Sandy in 2012, Ms. Fulvio became interested in helping care for New York waters after she retired.\u201cGetting involved is great,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s been an upsurge in people like me who probably weren\u2019t active really before this.\u201dDr. Fitzgerald and her team sample the oyster population to see what is working and what isn\u2019t. They count the number of live oysters versus the number of \u201cboxes,\u201d or empty oyster shells; they try to remove natural predators such as the oyster drill snail and pick up trash that might get stuck on the growing reef.Dr. Fitzgerald said a large part of the rehabilitation program involves setting solid bases such as rock and shell on the bay so young oysters can find a spot where they can attach themselves. Their biggest challenge, she said, has been figuring out a way to make sure the oysters stick to these foundations and don\u2019t die due to disease or natural predators.For Dr. Fitzgerald, coming out to the reef is a break from the hustle in New York City. She lives about two hours away in New Jersey from Soundview Park, but that doesn\u2019t stop her from waking up early to lead her team into the water, often in the early morning.\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful, and you get the birds and the crabs and the fish,\u201d she said. \u201cI get a lot of people from New York City, from the Bronx, here and they\u2019re like \u2018I didn\u2019t know this stuff was here.\u2019 \u201dEven though the terrain in the Soundview Park bay isn\u2019t the best for oysters\u2014partly because the sand is so soft and the water is contaminated\u2014this particular reef has a better record of success than other oyster colonies in New York, where entire reefs have washed out, Dr. Fitzgerald said.Restoring the harbor\u2019s habitat to what it once was years ago is impossible, she said, because human interaction has \u201cchanged it beyond the point of repair.\u201dThat, however, doesn\u2019t mean her group can\u2019t help it rehabilitate for future generations. She remains hopeful that, one day, her grandchildren will be able to see a thriving oyster reef in New York Harbor.Corrections & Amplifications   Dr. Allison Fitzgerald is holding an oyster cage in one photo in this story.

She had always disliked it, and after all the government had passed a law banning smoking in interiors back in 2009.It took only a few hours after opening her\u00a0cafe in a trendy Athens neighborhood to be sure of a second thing: Greeks believe rules are meant to be broken.Despite the law, patrons at her vintage-inspired spot lighted up without a thought. She removed ashtrays, added signs and spoke to customers directly, but it was futile. Customers now smoke\u00a0all they want, she said, starting early in the morning with coffee and ending late at night with a cocktail.In Greece, star athletes celebrate championships with cigarettes dangling from their lips\u2014star center       Ioannis Bourousis       of the Panathinaikos basketball team was seen toking on a cigar at a bouzouki bar after a big win in June.Taxi drivers smoke while driving, holding their cigarettes out an open window only when they have passengers.On a recent visit by       Amin Mohamed       to the local municipality office to take care of paperwork for his dry-cleaning business, the smoke was so thick that he finally asked the employee there to put out his cigarette. The employee simply opened a window and kept on smoking, he said.\u201cNothing will ever change,\u201d Mr. Mohamed said.Deputy Health Minister       Pavlos Polakis       blithely flouted the ban, lighting up while giving a press conference last year. At the Finance Ministry, smokers recently puffed away in a hallway under a large banner reading \u201cGreece stubs out cigarettes.\u201dAnd in October, at a lunch at the army officers club in Thessaloniki celebrating Greece\u2019s national holiday, President Prokopis Pavlopoulos lighted up a small cigar. The city\u2019s mayor, and much of the room, joined him.About 37% of Greeks smoke, the highest percentage in Europe, compared with an EU average of 26%, according to a 2016 EU survey. In the poll, seven years after the ban, 87% of Greeks said they had been exposed to indoor smoking in bars.Last year, Greece\u2019s Parliament added to the smoking regulations by passing a ban on electronic-cigarette\u00a0smoking\u00a0in public places.\u00a0During the debate, some lawmakers noted the irony of passing a new law in a chamber that ignores the original one.\u201cMeeting room, parties\u2019 offices, secretariats, walkways, toilets\u2014the cigarettes are everywhere,\u201d said center-right parliamentarian       Niki Kerameos.       \u201cIf we don\u2019t set an example of following the laws, how do we expect citizens to do so?\u201dMany Greeks see the state as corrupt and unreliable\u2014mainly shown by a widespread refusal to pay taxes. They also don\u2019t like controls on day-to-day behavior: cars don\u2019t stop at pedestrian crossings, motorcycles don\u2019t bother with lanes, trash is tossed out of moving vehicles. Double parking is notorious\u2014oddly, one of the rules Greeks do obey is the \u201cbasket in the street\u201d signal that a neighbor is saving a parking space, and the basket goes untouched.As the country grapples with a seven-year economic downturn, enforcement of all types of infractions is haphazard. Budget cuts have reduced by two-thirds the number of wardens who hand out traffic tickets and other fines, including for smoking, in the Attica region, which includes Athens. Municipal police, who can also issue fines, have been downsized. A telephone hotline that people can use to call the Health Ministry to complain about smoking violations is rarely answered.Officers have been waiting for months for the blocks of tickets used to issue smoking fines to be delivered from the printers.\u201cThis cannot be enforced\u2014no laws are enforced in Greece,\u201d\u00a0said Menios Stergiou,\u00a0owner of an all-day cafe-bar near downtown Athens. \u201cOne has to have respect for the state, but this is the worst possible period for Greeks to do so.\u201dHealth Minister Andreas Xanthos conceded that the smoking regulations hadn\u2019t been implemented. \u201cWhat we need is to give the feeling that we are restarting,\u201d he said to Parliament on May 31, International No Tobacco Day.The threat of fines on businesses of as much as\u00a0\u20ac10,000, or about $11,300, haven\u2019t been a deterrent. (Individuals also face fines from \u20ac50 to \u20ac3,000, depending on the circumstances.) Actually collecting the payments is difficult.At the beginning of the economic downturn, when the ban was first passed and inspections were more common, business owners got creative. Ashtrays disappeared from tables; instead, small cups or vases were placed next to no-smoking\u00a0signs. If inspectors noticed customers crushing out cigarettes in them, well, the individuals were just disobeying the rules.\u201cThe businessmen\u2019s imagination is never so vivid as when it comes to finding ways to break the law,\u201d said       Andreas Varelas,        Athens\u2019s vice mayor. \u201cRule-breaking is in Greeks\u2019 nature.\u201dA new incentive to reduce smoking could be fresh taxes on cigarettes that started in January, making the habit even more costly. \u201cSin\u201d taxes slapped on cigarettes as part of the conditions for Greece to receive bailout funds from its EU creditors have driven the cost of a pack of 20 cigarettes to about \u20ac4.50, a euro more than before the crisis.

That deal has an enterprise value of about $18 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter and a report by Cowen & Co.Mr. Singer\u2019s Elliott Management Corp. is putting together a competitive deal, one that values Oncor at $18.5 billion on an enterprise basis, an improvement over Mr. Buffett\u2019s offer, the hedge fund says.Elliott, a $33 billion investment company, was putting its transaction together when it got wind that Berkshire was preparing to sign an offer at a value that \u201cdoes not provide such value,\u201d according to a letter Elliott sent to Energy Future\u2019s board before Berkshire signed the deal.Elliott unveiled weeks of back-and-forth negotiations with Energy Future as yet another battle brews over Oncor, a key piece of the Texas infrastructure that has been sought by a succession of suitors.Oncor executives said in an interview that they have little knowledge of Elliott\u2019s plan.Oncor led talks in Austin with state regulators and large customers for several weeks ahead of Berkshire\u2019s bid, said Allen Nye, senior vice president at Oncor.The parties hammered out a list of conditions on which Berkshire and the regulators could agree.Elliott attended one of those meetings but didn\u2019t provide enough details of its plan to reach an agreement with the regulators, Mr. Nye said. Mr. Nye would become Oncor\u2019s chief executive if the Berkshire transaction closes.\u201cElliott has indicated they\u2019re pursuing a concept, but it\u2019s no more than a concept to us at this point,\u201d said       Bob Shapard,        Oncor\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThere\u2019s not a definite proposal that we can take to Austin and try to make a deal off, yet.\u201dMr. Buffett is known for making acquisitions quickly and avoiding auctions or deals that look too troublesome. If the deal went through, Oncor would be overseen by       Greg Abel,        chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Co. and a potential successor to Mr. Buffett.Mr. Singer\u2019s hedge fund, which is famous for its lucrative, 15-year fight to get Argentina to pay up on its defaulted bonds, is known for wading into trouble. Elliott purchased Energy Future\u2019s debt in recent months while other investors retreated.\u201cIf Buffett breaks his habit of avoiding bidding wars, his cost is not that he pays just a little more for Oncor, his cost is that he encourages Singer-like countermoves in every bid he makes from now on,\u201d said       Erik Gordon,        an assistant professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business.\u201cIf Buffett stands pat, Singer may get the company, and that may be more than [Singer] really wants.\u201dElliott was already out in the market looking for backers for its deal before Berkshire\u2019s offer was announced. Some Energy Future creditors said they hope the Berkshire offer was a \u201clowball\u201d price designed to be improved under pressure.In a court filing Friday, Energy Future cited \u201csignificant open issues\u201d with Elliott\u2019s proposal, which had been in the works since June, in explaining why it decided to take the Berkshire offer.Because of its long-running bankruptcy, Energy Future needs a court\u2019s permission to sign the deal with Berkshire. It hopes for an Aug. 10 hearing. Oncor is all that is left of Energy Future. The rest of the company exited bankruptcy last year, and now it is simply a holding company for the 80% Oncor stake.In a July 5 letter to Energy Future\u2019s board, Elliott said it wanted to sit down with Berkshire for talks, to avoid unnecessary delays and expenses.On Monday, Energy Future and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, through representatives, declined to discuss Elliott\u2019s proposal or the possibility of creditor talks.As a major Energy Future creditor, Elliott is in position to swap some debt for equity, reducing the amount of cash it needs to counter the Berkshire offer. It also plans to tap its own funds and draw in other investors to pay down some of Energy Future\u2019s $11 billion debt load, according to deal documents Elliott unveiled.A reorganized Energy Future, with only $4 billion in debt, would emerge from bankruptcy, still owning 80% of Oncor, under Elliott\u2019s proposal.And while owning Oncor might not have been what Elliott set out to do, the transmissions business is not distressed. It is a cash cow for owners, one that paid out $2.7 billion in dividends in the years since its majority owner, Energy Future, was saddled with debt in a 2007 leveraged buyout.Oncor stayed out of the bankruptcy thanks to \u201cringfencing\u201d provisions demanded by Texas regulators. The ringfence safeguards Oncor\u2019s cash flow and keeps the company in the hands of independent directors.Both Berkshire and Elliott say they will heed the ringfencing provisions.Berkshire already has made friends among big Texas energy consumers, industrial and municipal. It likely won\u2019t face opposition when its deal comes up for review before the Public Utility Commission of Texas, according to a statement issued last week by       Brian Lloyd,        executive director of the Public Utility Commission of Texas.Before it gets to the PUC, however, the Berkshire deal has to make it through bankruptcy court, where Elliott holds a commanding position as Energy Future\u2019s largest single creditor, owning 74% of a crucial class of debt.Earlier Oncor takeover attempts failed at the regulatory hurdle, including the most recent, a buyout by             NextEra Energy Inc.The failed NextEra deal may return to haunt Energy Future creditors.On Monday, NextEra in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, signaled that it will, as expected, press Energy Future for payment of a $275 million termination fee.Those funds would come out of the pockets of Energy Future creditors, chiefly Elliott. The hedge fund has made it clear it will battle NextEra over the termination fee.Write to Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.com and Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Elliott Is Set to Duel Berkshire in Battle For Utility Oncor.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 22:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elliott-set-to-duel-berkshire-for-energy-futures-oncor-1499716503", "news_title": "Elliott Set to Duel Berkshire for Energy Future\u2019s Oncor   ", "keywords": "bankruptcynews,deal,hedge fund,oncor energy,paul singer,private equity,warren buffett,Berkshire Hathaway,BRKA,Elliott Management,Energy Future Holdings,Oncor,Berkshire Hathaway Cl B,BRK.B,Warren Buffett,Greg Abel,Bob Shapard,bankruptcy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,energy,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,electric power distribution,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,security brokering,dealing,diversified holding companies,alternative investments,business,consumer services,electric utilities,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities,utilities"}, {"content": "Abercrombie & Fitch Co.\u2019s        ANF 2.80%       efforts to sell itself have stalled, leaving the apparel retailer to continue trying to right its business on its own.In May, the company\u00a0said it was in \u201cpreliminary discussions with several parties,\u201d though it warned the talks might not result in a transaction.\u00a0On Monday, Abercrombie said the deal talks were off, confirming an earlier report in the day by The Wall Street Journal.Shares of the company\u2014which as of Friday had a market value of $820 million\u2014fell 21% to $9.59 on Monday.The sales process had attracted a number of interested parties, including rivals             Express Inc.       and             American Eagle Outfitters Inc.,which teamed up with private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, people familiar with the matter said. Sycamore Partners was also involved in the process, but the buyout firm just last month struck a $6.9 billion deal to buy office-supply retailer             Staples Inc.In June, Abercrombie accepted final bids, but couldn\u2019t come to acceptable terms with suitors, according to the people. On Monday, Abercrombie said the best way for the company to create value for shareholders is \u201cthe rigorous execution of our business plan.\u201dThe retailer, which is based in New Albany, Ohio,\u00a0has been closing stores, lowering prices and revamping its marketing to win back shoppers, but revenue has declined for four straight years.Apparel retailers, especially those catering to teens, have been hit hard by declining mall traffic, changing tastes and new competition. Several Abercrombie rivals, including A\u00e9ropostale Inc., Wet Seal LLC and American Apparel LLC, have filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since the start of last year.In a note to investors on Monday, Jefferies said that while there may have been natural partners for Abercrombie, \u201cany interest that may have been present during negotiations eventually dissipated when realizing merger benefits like the elimination of overhead costs would likely be offset by time and resources needed to right the ship.\u201dThe brokerage added that American Eagle, which it called the \u201cstrongest operator in the young adult space\u201d and whose sales have eclipsed Abercrombie\u2019s in recent years, is better off without such a tie-up. \u201cVery few retail portfolio strategies have generated positive shareholder returns and, in fact, most have caused shareholder returns to be destroyed,\u201d Jefferies wrote.Former Chief Executive       Mike Jeffries       transformed Abercrombie from an old-fashioned outdoor retailer to a hot brand known for sex-tinged marketing and logo-emblazoned clothing, but that style has fallen out of fashion and the company has had to recalibrate.In addition to its namesake brand, Abercrombie also owns Hollister, which caters to a younger shopper. Hollister has fared better than its sister brand because it \u201coffers lower-priced goods and at the same time doesn\u2019t bear the burden of prior perception issues,\u201d Nomura Instinet analyst       Simeon Siegel       said, citing Abercrombie\u2019s baggage with some shoppers.It has been a difficult environment for retailers looking to sell themselves. Luxury department-store chain Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. had announced it was exploring its options earlier this year, but in June the company ended the process.

If granted a limited waiver by Congress, the group said it would seek stronger intellectual-property protections, better support for digital subscription models and a fairer share of revenue and customer data.\u201cQuality journalism is critical to sustaining democracy and is central to civic society,\u201d the alliance\u2019s president and chief executive,       David Chavern,        said in a statement. \u201cTo ensure that such journalism has a future, the news organizations that fund it must be able to collectively negotiate with the digital platforms that effectively control distribution and audience access in the digital age.\u201dPublishers have long been frustrated by Facebook\u2019s outsize role in news dissemination and commanding presence in the digital advertising market.Google and Facebook are expected to receive more than 60% of U.S. digital ad spending this year, according to eMarketer. And their combined market share is growing. Last year, the two companies captured more than 77% of the nearly $12 billion in additional spending on online ads in the U.S., eMarketer estimates.The tech behemoths have made efforts to work more closely with publishers both large and small to address issues as the news industry transitions from print to digital.Facebook has held numerous meetings with publishers over recent months\u2014including one in New York on Monday\u2014to discuss matters such as accommodating digital subscriptions, allowing publishers greater control over advertising, the platform\u2019s desire for more video content and how best to deal with fictional stories masquerading as news.Some of the meetings have gotten \u201cvery heated,\u201d attendees have said, and publishers have had mixed reviews about Facebook\u2019s understanding of their needs. At one particularly contentious session in late March that was hosted by the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University, two attendees said a publisher accused Facebook of taking advantage of the industry after Facebook\u2019s vice president for communication and public policy,       Elliot Schrage,        said: \u201cWe can\u2019t solve your business model.\u201dThe meeting on Monday was described as far less tense, with some saying the earlier meetings had served as an opportunity to air grievances.\u201cIt\u2019s imperative the news industry has sustainable business models, and we want to play a part in helping that happen. We\u2019ve held robust and constructive conversations with dozens of news organizations and look forward to more,\u201d said       Campbell Brown,        Facebook\u2019s head of news partnerships, in response to the News Media Alliance\u2019s announcement.Google has similarly sought to engage with publishers on how best to help them in the face of sometimes blistering criticism from some news outlets about its practices. Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp, the parent company of Dow Jones and the Journal, has for years accused Google\u2014and Facebook to a lesser degree\u2014of being a platform for \u201cpiracy.\u201d\u201cWe want to help news publishers succeed as they transition to digital,\u201d Google said in a statement. \u201cIn recent years we\u2019ve built numerous specialized products and technologies, developed specifically to help distribute, fund, and support newspapers. This is a priority and we remain deeply committed to helping publishers with both their challenges, and their opportunities.\u201dIn terms of securing a waiver to act collectively, publishers will need to identify a lawmaker willing to introduce legislation on their behalf. Such a waiver is uncommon, however, and the prospects for the alliance\u2019s push are unclear.Antitrust exemptions generally are disfavored by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which enforce U.S. antitrust laws. Proposed exemptions aren\u2019t usually embraced in Congress either, though there are exceptions.\u201cCongress adopts one probably every 8 to 10 years or so, but they are unpopular, draw a lot of eye-rolling from both parties, and I think it\u2019s fair to say that a few dozen are proposed and rejected during every Congress,\u201d said Cleveland State University law professor Christopher Sagers, who has written a book on the topic.One that passed came in 2004, when Congress granted an antitrust exemption for matching programs that place medical students in residency programs at hospitals and health systems. A group of medical school graduates had previously filed a lawsuit alleging the matching programs had the effect of suppressing competition for the hiring and compensation of resident physicians.The newspaper industry won an exemption of its own in 1970 when Congress passed the Newspaper Preservation Act, which in certain circumstances allowed competing publications in the same geographic area to combine production and business operations. The law was designed to help financially vulnerable papers stay afloat to preserve competing news coverage and editorial voices in a given community. Such joint agreements, however, have shrunk over time and the exemption has been criticized as ineffective.\u2014Jack Marshall contributed to this article.Write to Lukas I.

The solicitation doesn\u2019t need to be successful in order to be illegal.Prosecutions related to foreign-national donations have generally dealt with charges of funneling cash.In theory, opposition research on a political foe could be considered something of value, particularly if the supplier of the information spent money to obtain it, according to legal experts.But experts said it might be difficult to ascribe a value to a vague promise to provide damaging information about       Hillary Clinton,        which is how Mr. Trump Jr. described what he knew about the sit-down with the Russian lawyer,       Natalia Veselnitskaya       beforehand.In a statement, Mr. Trump Jr. said that Ms. Veselnitskaya had done nothing helpful for the campaign and that he cut off the meeting after she dwelled on the Magnitsky Act, a federal law that placed sanctions on Russian human-rights abusers.It is hard to draw any conclusions based on what is known about the circumstances of the meeting, said       Kenneth A. Gross,        a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and a former Federal Election Commission lawyer.\u201cAt best, the meeting might be grist for the mill for further inquiry, but that\u2019s about as far as we can go at this point,\u201d said Mr. Gross.Mr. Trump Jr. said Sunday that he didn\u2019t know the lawyer\u2019s name before seeing her, making it unclear whether he knew she was a Russian national. If true, this could make it more difficult to prove criminal intent by Mr. Trump Jr.But Robert Bauer, a partner at Perkins Coie LLP who previously served as White House counsel to former President       Barack Obama,        questioned why Mr. Trump\u2019s son took the meeting if he didn\u2019t know the lawyer\u2019s identity.\u201cThe fact that they took a meeting with a foreign national unquestionably raises a legal issue,\u201d said Mr. Bauer. \u201cIt is a significant question what they knew about this individual and what she proposed to bring to their attention.\u201dCommon Cause, a liberal watchdog group, demanded an investigation of the meeting in a complaint the group filed Monday with the FEC and with special counsel       Robert Mueller,        who is overseeing the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.In a tweet on Monday, Mr. Trump Jr. characterized the meeting as due diligence on the part of a campaign in a competitive race.\u201cObviously I\u2019m the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen,\u201d Mr. Trump Jr. wrote.\u2014Jacob Gershman and Nicole HongWrite to Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.com and Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Did the Meeting Cross a Legal Line?.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 20:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/election-law-provides-no-firm-say-on-legality-of-donald-trump-jr-s-meeting-1499733696", "news_title": "Election Law Provides No Firm Say on Legality of Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s Meeting ", "keywords": "donald trump jr. russia,hillary rodham clinton,trump administration,trump jr. russia,Donald Trump Jr,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The White House sought on Monday to explain the administration\u2019s reversal on the possible creation of a joint cybersecurity unit with Russia, a day after President       Donald Trump       shot down the idea in a tweet, contradicting top advisers and his own previous comments on the matter.White House deputy press secretary       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       said there was no commitment to putting in place \u201ca formal kind of structure,\u201d although she left the door open to such a deal with Russia, which Mr. Trump discussed in a Friday meeting with Russian President       Vladimir Putin.\u201cDiscussions may still take place, but that\u2019s as far as it is right now,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.Mr. Trump called the proposal impossible Sunday night. His apparent reversal came amid opprobrium from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who ridiculed the idea of partnering on cybersecurity with the very nation accused of interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign through hacking.\u201cThe fact that President Putin and I discussed a cyber security unit doesn\u2019t mean I think it can happen,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted late Sunday. \u201cIt can\u2019t\u2014but a cease-fire can, & did!\u201dA Trump administration official said Monday that Mr. Putin raised the issue with the U.S. president during their 2-hour, 15-minute meeting in Hamburg, Germany, on Friday amid a summit of 20 leading nations. Mr. Putin described the idea in benign terms and Mr. Trump expressed a willingness to look into it, the official said.But after hearing from various advisers that Russia might stand to gain more from the idea than the U.S., and after thinking it through, Mr. Trump decided to send out the tweet Sunday saying the plan was unworkable, the official said.Mr. Trump\u2019s change in tone came after harsh criticism from Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike. Sen.       Marco Rubio       (R., Fla.) likened it to partnering with Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad       on a chemical-weapons unit, an allusion to Syria\u2019s use of deadly gas bombs, and Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) accused the president of empowering Mr. Putin.The president\u2019s tweet seemed to contradict his own Treasury secretary, who hours earlier went on national television praising the possible cybersecurity deal as a foreign-policy breakthrough.\u201cThis is about having capabilities to make sure that we both fight cyber together, which I think is a very significant accomplishment for President Trump,\u201d Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       said Sunday morning on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201dSecretary of State       Rex Tillerson,        speaking at a press conference in Kiev the same day, said the U.S. and Russia had agreed to have a dialogue about how to gain assurances that there will be no interference in American elections in the future and explore a framework on how to deal with \u201cvery complex issues of cyberthreats, cybersecurity, cyberintrusions.\u201d\u201cI think the election interference really shows how complicated the use of these types of tools [is] becoming,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cWe have to find a way to begin to address that, and it\u2019s not going to be only about Russia. It\u2019s going to be about international engagement as well.\u201dMr. Trump gave no indication that he considered the creation of a joint cybersecurity group with Russia impossible when he promoted the idea in a tweet Sunday morning. Just before 8 a.m. on Sunday, Mr. Trump wrote that he and Mr. Putin had \u201cdiscussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded.\u201dBy 8:45 p.m., he was tweeting it couldn\u2019t happen.The Kremlin responded to the apparent reversal on Monday by saying journalists were misinterpreting Mr. Trump\u2019s comments.\u201cThat\u2019s not what he tweeted, the wording was different,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Interfax news agency.Mr. Peskov said the Russian and U.S. presidents discussed the possible creation of a bilateral cybersecurity working group.\u201cWhether it\u2019ll be established or not, time will tell, but the heads of state discussed the possibility,\u201d he said.Mr. Putin presented the idea in a Saturday press conference as a done deal.\u201cThe U.S. president and I have agreed to establish a working group and make joint efforts to monitor security in the cyberspace, ensure full compliance with international laws in this area, and to prevent interference in countries\u2019 internal affairs,\u201d Mr. Putin said.The president\u2019s advisers, however, became concerned that the initiative was being perceived as a high-level partnership that went beyond what Mr. Trump envisioned, the administration official said.During the Hamburg meeting, Mr. Putin denied Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, according to both delegations. Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Sunday morning that he had already given his own opinion on who was responsible\u2014he said other people and countries could have interfered in addition to Russia\u2014and called for the U.S. to work constructively with Russia.Those comments angered U.S. lawmakers pushing a sanctions bill to punish Russia for what the U.S. intelligence community described as interference in the 2016 campaign in favor of Mr. Trump. They accused him of being too quick to forgive and forget Russia\u2019s behavior.The bill, which passed in the Senate with a 98-2 vote but so far hasn\u2019t come to the House floor, would require the White House to seek congressional approval to lift sanctions on Russia.Write to Paul Sonne at paul.sonne@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Behind the Reversal On Cybersecurity.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 20:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-labors-to-explain-reversal-on-u-s-russian-cyber-cooperation-1499732015", "news_title": "White House Labors to Explain Reversal on U.S.-Russian Cyber Cooperation", "keywords": "russia cyber cooperation,trump russia,trump russia cyber,trump twitter,u.s. russia cyber,Vladimir Putin,Donald Trump,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "Hundreds of New York City teachers who have been stuck in a much-criticized pool for excess faculty will be sent to fill classroom vacancies in October, under a plan that city officials announced Monday.The city Department of Education said it wanted to reduce the size and cost of the pool, which had 822 people on the payroll last month. They are mostly a mix of teachers who lost posts due to school closings and shrinking enrollments, and those with tenure going through disciplinary proceedings.The policy change sparked an outcry from critics who worried that ineffective teachers would be forced on students and principals, who typically get to pick their own instructors.Many educators say that some faculty in what\u2019s known as the \u201cAbsent Teacher Reserve\u201d are gems but some have little skill, since those with talent tend to get hired quickly on the open market.In recent years, these teachers often bounced among schools to fill in for short stints. This new policy aims to send 300 to 400 to fill Oct. 15 vacancies in their license area for the whole year. Those rated effective would get to stay.Randy Asher, a senior adviser to Chancellor       Carmen Fari\u00f1a,        said this plan would help principals fill openings with credentialed teachers, and would give classrooms more stability than the rotating substitutes. He couldn\u2019t predict cost savings.Past estimates by city officials found that when the pool had about 1,200 teachers back in the spring of 2013, they cost $105 million in salaries and benefits, after savings from not hiring substitutes.One principal who asked not to be named expressed concern that if low-performing teachers were assigned to his school through this process, it would be hard to get rid of them because the evaluation tool had become less stringent.Michael Wiltshire,        principal of Medgar Evers College Preparatory School, said he had hired some outstanding teachers from the pool but others shouldn\u2019t be in the system, and principals should scramble to avoid October vacancies. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some ATRs who have come to the school and I tell you, you would not want those teachers to be in front of your child,\u201d he said. Department officials said they would work closely with principals in making assignments.Jenny Sedlis, executive director of StudentsFirstNY, a pro-charter group that advocates for stringent standards, said the policy favors the teachers union and harms children. \u201cIt is educational malpractice for the city to force place hundreds of teachers of dubious quality into the classrooms of our most vulnerable students,\u201d she said.Michael Mulgrew,        president of the United Federation of Teachers, said by email that \u201cthese changes reflect the UFT\u2019s conviction that members of the ATR pool provide needed services to schools and that their work should be respected.\u201dMark Cannizzaro,        executive vice president of the Council of School Supervisors & Administrators, said \u201cWe will monitor the implementation of this policy closely.\u201dWrite to Leslie Brody at leslie.brody@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 20:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyc-teachers-in-pool-for-excess-faculty-to-fill-classroom-vacancies-in-october-1499731541", "news_title": "NYC Teachers in Pool for Excess Faculty To Fill Classroom Vacancies in October ", "keywords": " absent teacher reserve, atr, carmen farina, new york city schools, nyc department of education, nyc schools,nyc teachers,randy asher,rotating tenured teachers,political,general news,education,school"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Senate\u00a0on Monday\u00a0confirmed       Neomi Rao,        a conservative law professor and expert in regulation, to head a powerful federal office that reviews and assesses the costs and benefits of rules issued by agencies across the government.The vote was 54-41, with five Democrats and one independent joining majority Republicans to confirm the nomination.Ms. Rao, an associate professor of law at George Mason University, joins an administration that has made clear its intent to roll back regulations issued by the Obama administration and cut red tape across the government. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which she will head, will be central to that effort.Within days of taking office, President       Donald Trump       signed\u00a0an executive order\u00a0aimed at trimming federal regulations and slowing the approval of new ones. In March, the president took steps to reverse Obama-era rules aimed at pushing U.S. utilities to\u00a0shift from coal\u00a0to cleaner-burning fuels. And his administration has outlined\u00a0a series of moves\u00a0to roll back provisions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul,\u00a0such as easing the Volcker rule ban on certain types of bank trading and investing.\u201cWe can all agree that federal regulations should achieve their aim without imposing unnecessary costs on the country\u2019s economy and job creators. I look forward to working with Professor Rao to reduce the burden of regulations,\u201d said Sen.       Ron Johnson,        a Wisconsin Republican.Ms. Rao declined to comment while the Senate was considering her confirmation.But she has over the years been outspoken in her criticism of regulators. In 2015 testimony before Congress, she blasted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2014created in the wake of the financial crisis and championed by Sen.       Elizabeth Warren       (D, Mass.)\u2014as \u201can especially stark example of the types of abuse that can result from overbroad delegations of authority to agencies.\u201d As a sign of the regulatory battles currently consuming Washington and awaiting Ms. Rao, the independent bureau touched off a firestorm of criticism from Republicans Monday by completing an Obama-era rule curbing the ability of companies to block consumer class-action lawsuits.OIRA, part of the White House budget office, doesn\u2019t have the power to write or kill rules, but it has tremendous influence through its authority to review regulations and send them back to agencies for rewriting, to collect information about regulations across agencies and to look at costs and benefits of new rules. Its director is sometimes known as the government\u2019s \u201cregulatory czar\u201d because of the power the agency carries within the bureaucracy.It was that power that concerned some Democrats. In a speech on the Senate floor shortly before the vote,\u00a0Ms. Warren\u00a0said Ms. Rao\u2019s nomination would give corporations more power over rule-making in Washington and cripple the ability of federal agencies to enforce existing laws and rules that benefit U.S. consumers.Ms. Rao \u201cadvocates for weakening and handcuffing agencies,\u201d Ms. Warren said, adding that her \u201cviews of agencies\u201d make her the wrong candidate to lead OIRA.After attending Yale College and the University of Chicago Law School, Ms. Rao clerked for Supreme Court Justice       Clarence Thomas       and worked as a lawyer in the       George W. Bush       White House. She has been critical of both of President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominees, testifying in 2009 that Justice       Sonia Sotomayor       had expressed views \u201cbeyond even mainstream pragmatic judicial philosophies\u201d identified with the left, and writing in 2010 that Justice       Elena Kagan\u2019s       \u201cproblem\u201d in preparing for her confirmation hearing was that\u00a0\u201c\u2018progressive\u2019 views of judging are difficult to defend.\u201dFor Ms. Rao, the White House job will offer an opportunity to test how theories she long has honed in academia play out in the real world. She has written law review articles examining such concepts as \u201cnondelegation,\u201d a constitutional doctrine that limits Congress\u2019 ability to assign its powers to the executive and judicial branches of government.Although simple in concept, legal scholars have differed over where the line lies between authorizing an agency to employ its expertise and experience to best carry out congressional objectives and abdicating the legislature\u2019s own responsibilities to the executive branch\u00a0and its regulatory agencies.In general, conservative legal theorists have been skeptical of federal regulatory authority. In practice, however, enthusiasm for regulatory power has correlated with the party controlling the executive branch.That may produce interesting questions for Ms. Rao to reconcile, particularly if Mr. Trump remains unable to advance his agenda through Congress and, as former President Obama did later in his term, relies increasingly on his executive powers to implement change through regulation.Ms. Rao founded the Center for the Study of the Administrative State at George Mason, a school known for its conservative faculty and expertise in the study of administrative law.But not all of her support came from the right.\u201cAs a former governor, I gave the executive the benefit of the doubt on executive appointments,\u201d said Sen.       Angus King,        a Maine independent who typically votes with the Democrats in the Senate, but voted in favor of Ms. Rao\u2019s nomination. He said he understood the concerns of his colleagues about Ms. Rao\u2019s potential impact on federal rules, but said his vote was in deference to Mr. Trump\u2019s right to make appointments to his administration.While Ms. Rao is a known conservative,\u00a0her backers\u00a0say she comes to the job with no preconceived notions, an attitude that informs her work style.\u201cShe is dispassionate with strong underlying sense of what regulation means in the construct of the Constitution,\u201d said       David Rehr,        senior associate dean and professor of Law at George Mason\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School. \u201cShe comes in with a very hard look at the facts, hears from all sides and says let\u2019s review the impact.\u201d\u2014Susan Benkelman and Andrew Ackerman contributed to this article.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com and Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 19:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-regulation-czar-cleared-by-senate-1499729652", "news_title": "Trump Regulation \u2018Czar\u2019 Cleared by Senate   ", "keywords": "cfpb,consumer financial protection bureau,finreg,neomi rao,nondelegation,office of information and regulatory affairs,oira,professor,regulation,Donald Trump,Neomi Rao,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house"}, {"content": "The mayhem in Venezuela is rising and dictator       Nicol\u00e1s Maduro       knows he\u2019s in trouble because on Saturday his security services moved opposition leader       Leopoldo L\u00f3pez       to house arrest from       Ramo Verde       military prison.Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s release is a victory for a weary opposition that has been protesting in the streets since April, demanding new elections and freedom for political prisoners. The National Guard and police have responded with violent crackdowns, and last week Mr. Maduro\u2019s goons stormed the national assembly and beat two opposition congressmen bloody. The death toll now exceeds 90 and there are still more than 400 political prisoners.Mr. Maduro called Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s release a humanitarian gesture, and at least the 46-year-old opposition leader is reunited with his wife and two young children. But he was fitted with an electronic bracelet and continues to serve what remains of his nearly 14-year sentence on trumped up charges of inciting violence during protests in 2014.Mr. Maduro fears that if Mr. L\u00f3pez were free to campaign he would galvanize the opposition and force an election Mr. Maduro would lose. (See       Vanessa Neumann      nearby.) Mr. Maduro has instead decided to throw out the constitution written under       Hugo Ch\u00e1vez       and have his followers draft a new one that will make the dictatorship official by shutting down the opposition-controlled legislature. The election for the assembly that will rewrite the constitution is scheduled for July 30. The opposition is vowing to abstain from what is certain to be a rigged vote.Venezuelans will have to liberate themselves, but international attention on Mr. L\u00f3pez may have played a role in his release.

But the bill that recently passed the Senate 98-2 contains a hastily written provision that could boomerang on U.S. interests, and the House can fix the potential damage.The problem is a provision that expands restrictions on how U.S. energy firms can interact with Russian counterparts. U.S. companies are already prohibited from investing in or advising on oil and gas projects in Russia. But the bill would also bar them from taking part in any project anywhere with sanctioned Russian firms. In practice this could bar U.S. companies from some of the biggest deepwater drilling projects around the world and thus help Russia and China.At issue is a quirk of the oil and gas industry known as \u201cunitization\u201d\u2014a technical term for operating efficiency. Governments (say, Brazil) will grant leases to many industry players for different blocks of the same oil field. While the leases are stand-alone deals, the host government will nonetheless require all players to jointly create the infrastructure (pipelines, etc.) to efficiently develop the field.Under the Senate language, U.S. companies would be barred from any project where sanctioned Russian firms were also granted exploration rights. Those blocks would instead be snapped up by European or Chinese firms that aren\u2019t bound by similar restrictions. Russia could even exploit the rules to hurt U.S. companies by bidding on projects solely to drive American energy firms out of deals.Richard Sawaya,        vice president of the National Foreign Trade Council, estimates that the Senate provision could bar U.S. oil and gas firms from some $100 billion in exploration projects over 10 years\u2014with commensurate damage to American jobs, shareholders and tax revenue. The provision might even help Russian companies get much of that business.The oil and gas industry supports the overall sanctions bill but wants to correct the boomerang provision. Texas Rep.       Pete Sessions       may be able to force some changes as head of the House Rules Committee, but he could use a hand from the       Trump       Administration. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       may be reticent given his former             Exxon                   ties, but this bill should transcend political appearances.The White House dislikes the sanctions bill because it limits President Trump\u2019s discretion to lift sanctions without Congressional approval. So it may be staying silent in hopes that the oil provision takes down the entire bill in the House. Republicans who want to act against Russia shouldn\u2019t let that happen.Mr. Trump wants to unleash U.S. oil and gas production, which properly deployed can undercut       Vladimir Putin\u2019s       petro-dollar revenue at home and his political leverage over European energy markets. It makes no sense to kneecap U.S. energy production in the rest of the world in a bill aimed at sanctioning Russia.Appeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-10 19:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-russia-sanctions-trap-1499729126", "news_title": "A Russia Sanctions Trap", "keywords": "political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,commentaries,opinions,editorials,energy"}, {"content": "The       Trump       Presidency is well into its seventh month but the Trump Administration still barely exists. Senate Democrats are abusing Senate rules to undermine the executive branch, and Republicans need to restore normal order.President Trump got an inexcusably slow start making nominations, but in the past few weeks he\u2019s been catching up to his predecessors. According to the Partnership for Public Service, as of June 28 Mr. Trump had nominated 178 appointees but the Senate had confirmed only 46.       Barack Obama       had 183 nominees confirmed by that date in his first term, and       George W. Bush       130.The White House has understandably begun to make a public issue of the delays, and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says it \u201chas only itself to blame.\u201d But a press release Mr. Schumer sent out Monday made the White House case, showing that the Senate has received 242 nominations but confirmed only 50 through June 30. Democrats are now the problem.Among the non-controversial nominees awaiting confirmation:       Kevin Hassett       to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers;       David Malpass,        under secretary at Treasury for international affairs; two nominees needed to review pipelines and other projects at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and Noel Francisco for Solicitor General. Mr. Malpass was nominated in March and voted out of committee in mid-June. Mr. Trump\u2019s State Department is barely functioning with only eight confirmed appointees.Democratic obstruction against nominees is nearly total, most notably including a demand for cloture filings for every nominee\u2014no matter how minor the position. This means a two-day waiting period and then another 30 hours of debate. The 30-hour rule means Mr. Trump might not be able to fill all of those 400 positions in four years. The cloture rule also allows the minority to halt other business during the 30-hour debate period, which helps slow the GOP policy and oversight agenda.Democrats have also refused to return a single \u201cblue slip\u201d to the Judiciary Committee, which has the effect of blocking consideration of judicial nominees from their home states. Senators like Minnesota\u2019s       Al Franken       and       Amy Klobuchar       are holding hostage the eminently qualified Minnesota Supreme Court Justice       David Stras       for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals for no reason other than politics.Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s troops are even invoking an obscure rule that prohibits committees from doing business more than two hours after the Senate opens for the day. Republicans have had to cancel briefings on national security and Russia electoral interference, as well as scrap a markup of two human-trafficking bills.Democrat       Harry Reid       didn\u2019t have the cloture headache when he was Majority Leader because in 2013 he cut a deal with Republicans. The GOP traded the ability to offer more amendments to legislation in return for letting Mr. Reid limit post-cloture debate for most nominations to eight hours. This rule let Mr. Reid confirm dozens of judicial and lower-cabinet nominations every week. But the deal expired in early 2015, and good luck getting Mr. Schumer to grant the GOP the same terms.Frustrated Republicans may soon begin listening to Oklahoma Senator       Jim Lankford,        who wants the majority to impose the eight-hour rule unilaterally. Most debate about nominees occurs during vetting and in committees. Eight hours on the floor is enough for all but the most controversial nominees, and the Senate could then get back to other business.As for the blue-slip tradition, it was designed to facilitate advice and consent by allowing Senators to use their home-state knowledge about local judges to better inform the White House. But it is a courtesy, not a rule, and Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley can ignore Senators who are using their blue slips as ideological vetoes of qualified candidates.Mr. Trump has nominated first-rate judges, and       Mr. Grassley       is justified in suspending blue-slip privileges on a case-by-case basis. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has also been starting the Senate at different times of the day to get around the Democratic sabotage of committee work. But note Mr. Schumer\u2019s childishness in forcing a game of Senate hide-and-seek.Mr. McConnell will be wary of Mr. Lankford\u2019s advice to change a Senate rule in the middle of the term, but the Majority Leader rightly did so when Democrats staged a historic filibuster of Supreme Court Justice       Neil Gorsuch.       Democrats aren\u2019t using cloture to raise the level of debate or highlight unqualified nominees. They are using it\u2014and have said as much\u2014to sabotage a Presidency. That isn\u2019t what the Founders intended, and Republicans have every right to stop this abuse of process to let the President form a government.Appeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-10 19:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/running-the-schumer-blockade-1499728159", "news_title": "Running the Schumer Blockade", "keywords": "Partnership for Public Service,political,general news,political appointments,terminations,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,commentaries,opinions,editorials"}, {"content": "Republicans returning to Washington on Monday said they hoped to produce a revised version of the Senate health bill later this week, though none of the expected changes so far appeared likely to win back sufficient support from the 10 GOP senators who have publicly opposed the bill.Sen.       John Cornyn       of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, said a bill could emerge within days. \u201cHopefully soon,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll vote on it next week.\u201dRepublican leaders were forced to postpone a vote on their bill shortly before last week\u2019s July 4 recess because of a lack of support, and none of the changes they have signaled they are considering have prompted any of the defectors to reverse course.GOP leaders, for example, are likely to insert $45 billion in funding to fight the opioid epidemic, but Sen.       Susan Collins       (R., Maine), said in response, \u201cThat\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s by no means sufficient.\u201d Like several other Republican senators, Ms. Collins is concerned about the bill\u2019s proposed cuts to Medicaid, and it isn\u2019t clear that a revised version would address those concerns.As Senate Republicans faced such dilemmas, President       Donald Trump       turned up the pressure to deliver his first major legislative victory before leaving town for their August recess.\u00a0\u201cI cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted Monday.Once the revised bill is produced, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office will provide an estimate of its impact on the federal budget and on Americans\u2019 insurance coverage, potentially early next week.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) can lose no more than two Republicans to pass the legislation with 50 votes, with Vice President       Mike Pence       casting the tie-breaking vote. No Democrats are expected to back the bill, which would dismantle large parts of the Affordable Care Act.The biggest sticking point in recent days has centered on a provision supported by GOP Sens.       Ted Cruz       of Texas and       Mike Lee       of Utah that would allow insurers that sell plans complying with ACA regulations to also sell health policies that don\u2019t.Health analysts say that would likely lower premiums for younger, healthier people, who would buy more limited policies, while causing premiums to rise for people with pre-existing conditions, who would buy the more comprehensive plans that comply with the ACA.Conservative lawmakers and outside groups have united around the provision, saying the bill must do more to lower costs. Mr. Lee won\u2019t vote for the bill unless the provision, or a similar measure, is included in the legislation, his spokesman said.But other Republicans are balking at its potential effect on premiums for people with pre-existing conditions. GOP senators had promised to address a criticism of the House health bill, passed in May, that it would harm people with pre-existing conditions.\u201cHis proposal would lead to unaffordable rates for people with pre-existing conditions,\u201d Ms. Collins said Monday of Mr. Cruz\u2019s proposal.Sen.       Shelley Moore Capito       (R., W.Va.), a centrist, said she has questions about the Cruz measure, which Sen.       Chuck Grassley       (R., Iowa), a conservative, has also criticized.But other Republicans said Monday they liked Mr. Cruz\u2019s idea.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to subsidize Americans who can\u2019t afford health insurance, do it directly. Don\u2019t do it through the premiums of others,\u201d said Sen.       Jeff Flake       (R., Ariz.)This back-and-forth highlights the challenge facing Mr. McConnell\u2014almost any change to the bill intended to placate one factions appears to solidify the opposition of another faction.Democrats said Mr. Cruz\u2019s proposal would lure people to sign up for cheap health-care plans and that many would then end up paying much more in high deductibles.\u201cIn effect, for many it\u2019s a policy that would have a premium, but no insurance,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said on the Senate floor Monday. \u201cThe Cruz amendment is a cruel, mean hoax.\u201dConcerned about their diminishing chances of passing a health-care bill that is widely unpopular in national polls, Senate Republicans have begun to chastise each other about the consequences of a high-profile legislative failure.Over the weekend, Mr. Grassley tweeted that all 52 GOP senators should be ashamed they haven\u2019t voted to repeal the ACA by now. If they fail, \u201cWE WILL GO FROM MAJORITY TO MINORITY,\u201d he warned.Democrats are largely playing defense in the 2018 Senate races, but an unpopular health-care bill could bolster the chances of the 10 Senate Democrats running for re-election next year in states won by Mr. Trump. On Monday, Save My Care, a group advocating to keep the ACA, began a seven-figure ad campaign urging GOP Sens.       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska,       Dean Heller       of Nevada and Ms. Collins and Ms. Capito to vote against the bill.The latter three already oppose the legislation.A Senate impasse would also likely infuriate many House Republicans, who narrowly passed a bill this spring after considerable debate and recrimination, and imperil the rest of Mr. Trump\u2019s legislative agenda.Some Senate Republicans said they remained optimistic that Mr. McConnell could find a way to secure 50 votes for the bill with tweaks to assuage senators\u2019 specific concerns. The opioid funding, for instance, is a particular concern of Ms. Capito, Ms. Collins and Sen.       Rob Portman       (R., Ohio).\u201cThere\u2019s a path to bringing the moderates on board,\u201d Sen.       Pat Toomey       (R., Pa.) said Monday on CNBC, and \u201cthere\u2019s still a path\u201d to the bill\u2019s passage.Other changes under consideration include leaving some of the taxes imposed by the ACA intact, and letting people use funds from their Health Savings Accounts to pay insurance premiums.Should the Republican health efforts fail, attention would turn to the fate of the ACA, often called Obamacare, which is the current law on health care and which Republicans have vowed for seven years to repeal.Congress will have to decide whether to financially boost the exchanges created by the law, especially since insurers are pulling out of some states. Mr. McConnell has warned Republicans that if their bill fails, they will have to work with Democrats to shore up the individual market.That insurance market did generate better financial results for insurers in the first quarter of 2017 than for the same period in recent years, according to a study released Monday by the Kaiser Family Foundation, potentially signaling greater stability.Insurers\u2019 average medical loss ratio\u2014the ratio of claims paid to premiums received\u2014was about 75% in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 86% for first quarter of 2016 and 88% for the same period in 2015, the study found. The gross margin of premiums to claims was about $99 per enrollee in the first quarter of 2017.The Trump administration, however, seized on what it said was a drop in insurer applications to offer plans under the ACA. According to an administration release, federal officials received 141 applications to sell plans in 2018 in the 39 states that rely on the federal exchange, down from 227 last year and 281 the year before.\u2014Anna Wilde Mathews contributed to this article.Appeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Senate Looks to Revise Health Bill.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 18:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-republicans-set-sights-on-revised-health-bill-1499725214", "news_title": "Senate Republicans Set Sights on Revised Health Bill ", "keywords": "health care overhaul,john cornyn,mitch mcconnell,obamacare,senate,Lisa Murkowski,Susan Collins,Shelley Moore Capito,John Cornyn,Mike Pence,Donald Trump,Dean Heller,Mike Lee,Pat Toomey,Rob Portman,Ted Cruz,Chuck Grassley,Jeff Flake,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,health care policy,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch"}, {"content": "As the search for evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government enters its second year, a senior congressional Republican sees mounting evidence that Russia has been engaged in a long-term campaign to disrupt the energy agenda now promoted by Donald Trump. Today the House Science Committee sent this column the following statement from Chairman Lamar Smith:He\u2019s referring to Trump Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin.       On Friday Mr. Smith released a letter that he and Energy Subcommittee Chairman Randy Weber sent to Mr. Mnuchin asking for an investigation of \u201cwhat appears to be a concerted effort by foreign entities to funnel millions of dollars through various non-profit entities to influence the U.S. energy market.\u201d The two Texas Republicans added:The letter from Messrs. Smith and Weber also says that according to public sources, including a 2014 report from Republican staff on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, \u201centities connected to the Russian government are using a shell company registered in Bermuda, Klein Ltd. (Klein), to funnel tens of millions of dollars to a U.S.-based 501(c)(3) private foundation,\u201d which supports various environmental groups.In response to an inquiry from this column, Roderick M. Forrest of Bermuda\u2019s Wakefield Quin Limited says in an emailed statement:Leaving aside the specific question of which vehicles Putin\u2019s government uses to conduct influence campaigns, the two Texas Republicans aren\u2019t the only ones who have made the more general accusation that Russia has been funding green front groups to disrupt energy supplies that would compete with Russian oil and gas. If a document posted last year on WikiLeaks is to be believed, Clinton campaign staff summarized in an email attachment       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       remarks on the subject during a private speech:Reading further into the speech summaries in the WikiLeaks document, this column is struck by how much more sensible Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private remarks were compared to her public positions:Hillary Clinton obviously knows the terrain and perhaps Mr. Mnuchin (whose department holds expertise in tracking international financial flows) should start his inquiry by interviewing the former secretary of State. He might also gain some insights into Russia\u2019s strategy to handicap competing sources of fossil fuels by talking to former Clinton campaign Chairman       John Podesta.Mr. Podesta has been back in the news lately after President Trump oddly tweeted from Germany to report that \u201ceveryone\u201d at the G20 was talking about the former Clinton and Obama aide\u2019s response to last year\u2019s theft and disclosure of Democrats\u2019 emails.More relevant to the issue of Russian efforts to undermine U.S. oil and gas, Mr. Podesta served on the board of a solar energy start-up where he invested alongside a fund backed by the Russian government. Last year a Clinton campaign spokesman said that when Mr. Podesta returned to the White House in 2014, he \u201ctransferred the entirety of his holdings\u201d in the solar company \u201cto his adult children.\u201d Last month he didn\u2019t seem any more eager to discuss the details with             Fox Business Network\u2019s      Maria Bartiromo       than Mr. Podesta\u2019s adult daughter was when your humble correspondent called her last year.Perhaps Mr. Mnuchin can get the full story as he seeks Mr. Podesta\u2019s insights on Russia\u2019s energy investment strategy.***Bottom Story of the DayGuess How Many Cars Tesla Can Sell Without Taxpayer Subsidies  \u201c            Tesla Inc.\u2019s       sales in Hong Kong came to a standstill after authorities slashed a tax break for electric vehicles on April 1...Not a single newly purchased Tesla model was registered in Hong Kong in April, according to official data from the city\u2019s Transportation Department analyzed by The Wall Street Journal,\u201d July 9***Follow James Freeman on Twitter.Subscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.(Carol Muller and Sophie Mann help compile Best of the Web.)", "news_time": "2017-07-10 18:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-did-hillary-know-about-russian-interference-1499723857", "news_title": "What Did Hillary Know about Russian Interference?", "keywords": "capacity,facilities,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,natural reserves,resources discovery,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,basic materials,resources,natural gas,oil extraction,fracking,mining,quarrying"}, {"content": "LondonIt is known in the tennis world as \u201cManic Monday,\u201d the start of the second week of Wimbledon, the most frenzied day in the sport.Tournament organizers spend the first six days here sending 224 players home, take Sunday off, then on the second Monday of the fortnight try to send all 16 remaining men and all 16 remaining women out for midday-to-dusk tennis marathon.For a tennis fan\u2014and after Rafael Nadal\u2019s five-set loss to Gilles Muller Monday, how could you not be one\u2014it is a golden day, a dizzying run of matches. Any one of these matches might be reason enough for a sick day. Indeed, anytime a 35-year-old       Roger Federer       struts onto Centre Court, hooky seems justified.How dizzying?Schedulers relegated top-seeded Angelique Kerber to Court 2 to open play against Garbine Muguruza\u2014which she lost in three sets.       Venus Williams       turned back the clock again and set up a Tuesday duel with French Open champion Jelena Ostepenko.Britain\u2019s Johanna Konta thrilled the home country with a nail-biting three-set victory while countryman Andy Murray prevailed despite more on-court self examination.Federer was Federer in victory, but Nadal lost his epic duel while Novak Djokovic waited and waited and waited to play. Along the way, journeymen Sam Querrey and Kevin Anderson staged a five-set duel, and Milos Raonic and Tomas Berdych also won five-setters.This day is the Viennese dessert table of sports, a disorienting beautiful struggle to be at the right match at the right time, the ultimate challenge in FOMO (fear-of-missing-out, for those who need to know). Here\u2019s how I played my hand.Just after noon: Kerber descended into her death struggle, while 60 yards away Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland, with those slinky wrists and the trickiest spins and slices, tried to stay alive against Russia\u2019s Svetlana Kuznetsova, a two-time grand-slam winner. (She lost.) Meanwhile, Ostapenko, who swings hard, harder and hardest, held a clinic against fourth-seeded Elina Svitolina.The next hour produced another devil\u2019s choice: Venus Williams, who at 37 won again in the second week, (for how much longer?), or the rising American Coco Vandeweghe, who made former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki wonder why this 25-year-old isn\u2019t ranked in the top 10. Or Konta, who on Court 1 was trying to become the first Briton since Virginia Wade in 1977 to win the women\u2019s title.Konta won me over, and then the match. At five-foot-11, she is long and athletic, plays close to the ground, and has lately found a fearless ability to swing away when she is behind. It took three sets, but when Caroline Garcia of France netted an easy ball at mid-court in the 10th game of the third set, Konta moved into the quarters. All 11,400 watching in the stands, and much of this country, took their first full breath in hours.Mid-afternoon: Murray took Centre Court, but Querrey and Anderson were in a cracker on tiny Court 18. I gave Querrey-Anderson a try. No seats available. I missed Querrey\u2019s five-set thriller of a win. I also missed Marin Cilic\u2019s three-set thrashing of Roberto Bautista Agut on Court 12, which might as well be in Wales, and the Raonic and Berdych thrillers.My consolation was a taste of Murray. The silence of Centre Court has a different hum than any other silence, especially when Cockney-accented \u201cCam Aunnn Andee!\u201d screams keep breaking it.As Murray won, Nadal dropped set two on Court 1. Luxembourg\u2019s Muller is magic on grass, but in set three, Rafa ripped some early backhand winners. He hop-skipped and fist-pumped and had Muller on his heels. Federer had taken his Centre Court stage, but you just knew Rafa was starting something special. Muller seemed to know it, too.At 6:17 p.m., Rafa drew even at two sets. I experienced the opposite of FOMO.In the fifth set, Nadal faced two match points serving at 4-5. Four big serves later, it was 5-5, then 6-6.No tiebreakers here. Nadal seemed forever behind and faced two more match points at 9-10. He saved them again, 10-10. Agita rippled across Mallorca. He stayed alive, but couldn't convert his few chances to break Muller\u2019s serve.At 13-14, he rimmed a forehand and faced two more match points. Muller only needed one. After four hours, 48 minutes, the saga ended.\u201cI was there to fight to the last ball,\u201d a despondent Nadal said.It was 8:35 p.m. Darkness descended. There are no lights here.

For if the Trump administration hopes to enlist an unwilling Beijing to check North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions, visas for the children of China\u2019s ruling class to attend these universities offer an excellent pressure point.Beijing has been Pyongyang\u2019s closest ally ever since the Cold War split the peninsula after World War II. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, China provides North Korea with \u201cmost of its food and energy.\u201d Though China has warned       Kim Jong Un       about his nuclear testing (which Mr. Kim has ignored), plainly it fears a free and united Korean peninsula more than a nuclear-armed North.Revoking visas for Chinese students, of course, would not alone resolve the North Korea problem even if it did force Beijing to act. But Beijing could make life for North Korea difficult if it chose to.Thus far most talk about U.S. options regarding North Korea has focused on economic sanctions or military action against the Pyongyang regime. The dilemma is that every meaningful option comes with big risks, including the devastation of Seoul, retaliation against U.S. troops and more suffering for innocent North Koreans. The advantage of starting with student visas is twofold: The unintended harm done would be more limited than any military strike, and visas are likely a more effective lever than sanctions.Today 328,547 Chinese students attend American universities, according to the Institute for International Education. The Chinese represent the largest group of foreign students in America.How many of these students are children of Chinese leaders is unclear. American universities are disinclined to provide this information. In addition, the children of Chinese government officials sometimes attend U.S. universities under assumed names.The Chinese taste for prestigious American universities goes right to the top. Although President       Xi Jinping       rails against the corruption of Western values, his daughter went to Harvard, which Mr. Xi managed to swing on an official annual salary of roughly $20,000. A few years back, the Washington Post noted that of the nine members of the standing committee of China\u2019s Politburo, at least five had children or grandchildren studying in the U.S. There are many, many more.Officially, of course, China is an egalitarian society. In reality, hereditary favors, which now include access to top U.S. universities, are a fixed perk of Communist Chinese culture.Put it this way: If China\u2019s ruling elite were forced to choose between supporting North Korea and their children\u2019s access to American universities, is it all that hard to see where they would come down? This might be especially true if we continued to allow ordinary Chinese citizens with no family connections to the party or government to come study here.Would China retaliate? Probably. Would our universities scream? Without doubt. Would there be unfairness? Absolutely.But if the U.S. does not act quickly, a despot who executes people with antiaircraft guns will soon have the capability to strike Seattle or Chicago with a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile. A White House unwilling to consider Chinese student visas as leverage to prevent this would signal Pyongyang and Beijing alike that America is not serious.U.S. visas are the one thing we know people want. Before       Ray Mabus       served as       Barack Obama\u2019s       secretary of the Navy, he was       Bill Clinton\u2019s       ambassador to Saudi Arabia. There he championed the cause of two American women who had been kidnapped as children and taken to Saudi Arabia by their father, after he\u2019d been divorced in the U.S. by his American wife.To make the pressure real, Ambassador Mabus cut off all American visas for the father and his Saudi relatives. That got their attention. Unfortunately the deal for the girls\u2019 freedom collapsed after Mr. Mabus left Riyadh and his successor lifted the hold on the visas.China is even more vulnerable to such pressure.       Perry Link,        a China scholar at the University of California, notes that the family connections that lie just below the surface in Chinese Communist culture are more powerful than outsiders realize. He likens it to the Mafia.Imposing sanctions on the offspring of China\u2019s rulers \u201cmight raise howls in the U.S. but would be perfectly normal and rational\u2014unexceptional\u2014inside the culture of the people we would be sanctioning,\u201d says Mr. Link. \u201cThey would \u2018get it,\u2019 and the pinch would be felt.\u201cWhether or not it would be enough to budge them from their 30-year-old position on North Korea is a different question.

Another Group of 20 summit has come and gone, and yet again the world has failed to change.This should not come as a surprise; global summits are almost always empty exercises in public relations. They survive only to make politicians look good. Incumbent presidents and prime ministers strut before the cameras, hoping to look like leaders and statesmen in contrast to their political rivals back home. Egos in wannabe powers are stroked, as the world\u2019s great powers pretend to take them seriously for a few days. There are gassy dinners and gassier communiqu\u00e9s that mean nothing and achieve nothing, yet are haggled over line by line before falling into the oblivion that will entomb them forever.Will any country change its trade policy as a result of anything in the G-20 communiqu\u00e9? Will any country change its environmental policies as a result of anything said there? Will any serious historian 50 years from now\u2014or even five\u2014have even the slightest interest in anything the summit produced? Will any of the leaders who signed the communiqu\u00e9 spend five minutes thinking about how to implement it back home?The answer to all of these questions is, almost certainly, no. All other G-20 summits were forgotten before the last leader returned home; this one is no exception. The world is not governed, or even significantly influenced, by a committee of 20 presidents and prime ministers signing vaguely worded statements with no binding force; history is not made by communiqu\u00e9.Great powers, on the other hand, do make history, and even as the hollow rituals of G-20 summitry unrolled, the great and the near-great powers were busy. The rising tension over North Korea\u2019s missile program drove a flurry of Asia-centric diplomacy as the U.S., China, Russia, South Korea, India and Japan explored their options in closed bilateral sessions. Judging from its rhetoric, the Trump administration appears to believe its diplomatic options on this issue are rapidly disappearing. China so far refuses to impose the kind of isolation on North Korea that could threaten the regime\u2019s existence, and Russian missile specialists are reported to be helping North Korea\u2019s current efforts.President Trump is looking at a set of bad options: capitulation or a bout of coercive diplomacy that involves the threat of war. Whether the Trump administration restrains North Korea or acquiesces in its nuclear and missile program for want of alternatives, Northeast Asia is moving toward its most important strategic realignment since the Communist conquest of China.Forestalling a war between the U.S. and North Korea is not, unfortunately, the only major challenge the administration faces. Russia, China and Iran, the big three revisionist powers, spent the Obama administration chipping away at world order, and their efforts and those of their smaller sidekicks (like North Korea) have begun to pay off. From Ukraine to the Balkans, Europe has become less stable; the Middle East is a cauldron of conflict and hate. ISIS may be losing territory, but its violent ideology is gaining ground. We do not know where the challenges will come or what form they will take, but the Trump administration is likely to face much sterner international tests than anything President Obama saw.This is not good news. Barring a Pearl Harbor or 9/11 type of attack\u2014and perhaps even under those circumstances\u2014the Trump administration would begin a conflict with a hostile, deeply skeptical press and with much of the public leaning toward blaming the U.S. rather than its opponents for the crisis. Potential enemies are well aware that American public opinion is the Achilles\u2019 heel of an otherwise nearly invincible American military machine.Foreigners see a beleaguered American president, a press in full Watergate mode, and a public that is weary of engagement overseas. Across the globe, America\u2019s competitors are thinking about how they can use this moment to advance their own agendas. America\u2019s allies wonder whether they can continue to count on the U.S. for their security. America\u2019s adversaries and potential adversaries are mulling how U.S. weakness can best be exploited.This combination of American disunity and growing world instability, not the language of the G-20 final communiqu\u00e9, is driving world history today. This is what our politicians and our officials ought to be thinking about. This, not parsing the body language of world leaders at a vacuous meet-and-greet, is what the press should be covering. This is what could make the difference between peace and war. This is what anyone seriously interested in putting America first and making it great again needs to address.Mr. Mead is a fellow at the Hudson Institute, a professor of foreign affairs at Bard College and editor at large of the American Interest.Appeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-10 18:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-g-20-another-vacuous-meet-and-greet-1499726987", "news_title": "The G-20: Another Vacuous Meet-and-Greet", "keywords": "g 20,g-20 countries,g-20 summit,international relations,president obama,president trump,world leaders,political,general news,politics,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Can we grasp the essence of something by laying bare its origins? \u201cAn origin is not just a beginning,\u201d       Steven Weitzman       writes, \u201cit is a \u2018beginning that explains.\u2019 \u201d In \u201cThe Origin of the Jews,\u201d Mr. Weitzman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, aims to find one nation\u2019s elusive starting point. \u201cThe Jews have one of the longest and most intensively studied histories of any population on earth,\u201d he notes, \u201cbut the beginning of their history, how it is that the Jews came to be, remains surprisingly unsettled.\u201dThe reason for this is that, until recently, the biblical narrative held sway: Jews understood themselves to be the children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, members of a family that was forged into a people by enslavement in Egypt and revelation at Mount Sinai. Yet ever since the Bible\u2019s historical veracity came under scrutiny in the 18th and 19th centuries, scholars seeking to distinguish historical fact from religious myth have questioned how Jews today are related to the Hebrews of the Torah and the Judeans of the New Testament.Because origins can be entangled with authenticity, the inquiry is not without its risks. \u201cGoing back to antiquity,\u201d Mr. Weitzman writes, \u201canti-Jewish animosity has sometimes expressed itself in the form of counter-origin stories that seek to mock and discredit the Jews by negating their own understanding of their origin.\u201d Centuries of Christian polemics, Mr. Weitzman adds, \u201csought to discredit the Jews as authentic heirs to biblical Israel\u201d by questioning the continuity between Jews and their ancient forebears and caricaturing them as a rootless people.Today the search for origins, already fraught, has come to be entangled with the legitimacy of the state of Israel. Mr. Weitzman cites critics who challenge Zionist claims that modern-day Jews, sharing a genealogical and geographical origin with their ancient ancestors, are indigenous to the land of Israel.By Steven Weitzman  Princeton, 394 pages, $35The first to gauge the formative moment of this people\u2019s story, Mr. Weitzman says, were 20th-century archaeologists who claimed that around 1200 B.C. the Israelites emerged from the earlier Canaanite culture. The archaeologists variously proposed that the Israelites were invaders from Egypt who seized Canaan in an act of conquest; migrants from Mesopotamia who infiltrated the land peacefully; or Canaanite peasants who revolted against their exploiters and gave birth to a new set of rituals and principles. The pioneering biblical archaeologist       W.F. Albright       (1891-1971) found evidence of an abrupt leap: \u201cThe Canaanites, with their orgiastic nature-worship . . . were replaced by Israel, with its nomadic simplicity and purity of life, its lofty monotheism and its severe code of ethics.\u201dStill other scholars locate the Jews\u2019 founding moment in the encounter with the ancient Greeks. Drawing on       Shaye Cohen\u2019s       study \u201cThe Beginnings of Jewishness\u201d (1999), Mr. Weitzman takes up the theory that Judaism (itself a Greek coinage of the second century B.C.) was catalyzed by the Judeans\u2019 cross-fertilization with Hellenistic culture. Before Alexander the Great\u2019s conquest, Judean identity was a matter of ethnicity, determined by birth. Afterward, emulating the ways in which Greeks thought of their \u201cGreekness,\u201d it became a community of belief. Paraphrasing Mr. Cohen, Mr. Weitzman writes that \u201cthe Judeans realized under the influence of the Greeks that identity was not fixed by birth, that one could make oneself into a Jew through conversion.\u201dMr. Weitzman devotes his final chapter to deciphering the Jews\u2019 genetic signature. While many remain wary of a \u201cracialized understanding of Jewishness associated with Nazism,\u201d Mr. Weitzman writes, in recent years DNA research has largely confirmed much of what Jews have believed: \u201cthat they have an ancestry distinct from that of the non-Jews among whom they live, and that some of those ancestors came from the Near East.\u201d At the same time, Mr. Weitzman acknowledges the obvious limits of such an approach: \u201cGeneticists will always need to rely on nongenetic evidence\u2014written texts, oral traditions, interviews with subjects about who they are and where they come from\u2014to turn data into a coherent account of the past.\u201dLately critics have challenged the very assumptions on which such a search rests. The belief in a founding moment hidden in prehistory, they contend, involves an act of imagination, if not fabrication. And if an origin is an artificial construct, a projection onto the past to suit the needs of the present, the pursuit of origins can only be an exercise in futility.Mr. Weitzman cites several advocates of such a view. In a much-heralded book, \u201cThe Invention of the Jewish People\u201d (2008), the Israeli revisionist historian       Shlomo Sand       maintains that Jewish nationhood was a fiction contrived in the 19th century by \u201cagents of memory\u201d who minimized the heterogeneity of Jewish ancestry. Mr. Weitzman warns that Mr. Sand \u201crecycles ideas that have an anti-Jewish pedigree,\u201d like the theory\u2014endorsed by Stalin and dusted off by Mr. Sand\u2014that European Jews descend from the Khazars, a Turkic clan said to have converted to Judaism in the eighth century.Rather than debate such tendentious theories, Mr. Weitzman offers an admirably balanced and dispassionate survey and points to the conflicting impulses in the human mind between \u201cits need to relate itself to a point of origin and its need to efface that origin.\u201dIn the end, though, he arrives at an impasse. He concedes that scholarship \u201chas failed to generate an alternative narrative that can do the kind of work the Book of Genesis does in helping people to comprehend themselves and their places in the world.\u201d Perhaps this is as it should be. The more we try to explain our origins, the enigma of the beginning recedes further beyond our reach.Mr. Balint, a writer living in Jerusalem, is the author of \u201cKafka\u2019s Last Trial,\u201d to be published next year by Norton.Appeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'In the Jewish Beginning.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 18:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-search-of-the-origin-of-the-jews-1499726881", "news_title": "In Search of the Origin of the Jews", "keywords": "book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Baseball is the only major sport without a clock. When we first played baseball as kids, the game wasn\u2019t over until mom called from the back porch telling us supper was ready. We played with total disregard for how well\u2014or badly\u2014we played yesterday, and we never thought about tomorrow. Baseball and time creep along side by side, yet never intersect.With its disregard for time, baseball suits the elderly. For us baseball is never about yesterday or tomorrow. What happened yesterday is done. We know we cannot take tomorrow for granted. Today\u2019s game is all that matters.I once asked a Negro League veteran how the game had changed. His immediate reply was that in his day every player could bunt. Today the bunt has virtually disappeared. It will return. Some tough-minded manager will decide to exploit the now-routine practice of shifting the third baseman to the right side of the infield to defend against a left-handed batter. Baseball always adjusts.One adjustment that may be on its way is legalized betting. The U.S. Supreme Court recently accepted a challenge to the federal statute that limits sports betting to the state of Nevada. The National Basketball Association has openly supported betting, and Major League Baseball Commissioner       Rob Manfred       has said he is reviewing the matter. The National Football League seems to be the most reluctant of the three major sports to welcome legalized betting.Ultimately the enormous financial benefits from legal betting will sweep away traditional resistance. Sports betting is currently estimated to be a $150 billion business. The future was made clear by the speed with which the fantasy betting business was made legal.Meanwhile the games go on and I watch with an interest that time has diminished but never erased. The appeal of baseball is that it is so comfortable an experience. I warm to the players I have watched for years. I delight in the new kids who are only beginning to make their marks.Baseball exists outside time. I have been out of baseball for 25 years. A handful of the people I knew are still in the game. Some of them are umpires. I knew the veteran umpire Al Barlick, who died in 1995. Barlick had come to the majors when the \u201cfather of baseball umpires,\u201d       Bill Klem,        was still active, in the early 1940s. Klem began his career in 1906 and worked 18 World Series. Now, both he and Barlick are in the Hall of Fame. Old men like me appreciate such continuities.Perhaps the essential baseball truth is that failures are more frequent than successes. A great hitter only gets one hit every three times he comes to the plate. Errors are recorded because they are common. Mistakes are part of the game. It takes some maturity to accept that reality.Baseball can be taken too seriously by some, but we old men know better. The game is played only in the present. Similarly, every aspect of my life is being played one day at a time.

Americans may recall President       Trump\u2019s       February tweet demanding Mr. L\u00f3pez be freed. Has the regime of President       Nicol\u00e1s Maduro       at last yielded to international pressure?Not likely. Mr. Maduro\u2019s objective\u2014for he controls the Supreme Court, whose justices are party appointments\u2014seems to have been to quiet street protests by making the opposition look co-opted, thereby discrediting it. But Mr. L\u00f3pez announced he would keep fighting the regime and supported this past Sunday\u2019s 100 Day March\u2014although he abided by the terms of his house arrest and stayed off the street.The march commemorated the 100th day of the street demonstrations that began March 30, when the Supreme Court effectively stripped the National Assembly of its legislative power. The Assembly has been controlled by the opposition since elections in late 2015, and the court\u2019s decision\u2014although reversed the next day amid a public outcry\u2014removed any doubt that Venezuela has become a dictatorship.Since then, things have gotten even worse. Mr. Maduro announced May 1\u2014May Day\u2014that an appointed \u201cconstituent assembly\u201d would meet July 30 to draft a new Cuban-style constitution. Adding insult to injury, the drafters are to meet at the Legislative Palace, seat of the democratically elected National Assembly.A taste of the clash to come came on July 5, Venezuela\u2019s independence day. Armed plainclothes gangs called colectivos invaded the National Assembly and attacked lawmakers, leaving five badly injured, as the National Guard stood and watched. The colectivos were set up over a decade ago, allegedly on the model of Iran\u2019s basij militia.But the ruling regime is far from united. On the evening of July 5, Mr. Maduro publicly stated that \u201csomething strange has happened at the National Assembly\u201d and announced he would launch an investigation. His plan for a new constitution even has drawn opposition from some die-hard Chavistas, who view the current constitution, adopted in 1999, as the crowning achievement of the Bolivarian Revolution under       Hugo Ch\u00e1vez,        Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor.On April 1\u2014the day after the Supreme Court backed down from its decision on the National Assembly\u2014Attorney General       Luisa Ortega D\u00edaz,        a career Chavista, proclaimed that \u201cthe constitutional order has been broken.\u201d Last week the Supreme Court attempted to usurp her power by appointing a new deputy attorney general, an office that is legally Ms. Ortega\u2019s to fill. The illicitly appointed deputy was then smuggled into the Public Ministry in the trunk of a car. When she was discovered and thrown out, the episode became the stuff of comical internet memes.The military is also jockeying for position. A year ago the commanding general or admiral of all four branches of the Venezuelan military sent a letter to       Lu\u00eds Almagro,        secretary-general of the Organization of American States. The OAS had just issued a report condemning Caracas\u2019s violations of human rights and the country\u2019s constitution. The generals promised to defend the nation against human-rights violations and subversion of the constitution\u2014meaning they would abide by the will of the people, reflected in the National Assembly.The letter was made public only last Friday. Its release signals that the military, which has long viewed Mr. Maduro as a Cuban puppet, will not stand for Mr. Maduro\u2019s attempt to rewrite the constitution. It also further reveals the fissures within the country\u2019s Chavismo elite.Diosdado Cabello,        a military man who helped restore Ch\u00e1vez to power after a 2002 coup attempt, has been arguing that he should be Mr. Maduro\u2019s successor. On his nationally broadcast TV show, \u201cAqu\u00ed No Se Habla Mal de Ch\u00e1vez\u201d (also a             Twitter                   hashtag), he shows footage of himself by Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s side stretching back to their 1992 coup attempt and claims Ch\u00e1vez was like a father to him. As president of the National Assembly before the opposition took it over, Mr. Cabello made a show of personally driving Mr. L\u00f3pez to prison, purportedly to protect him from \u201cultraright\u201d assassins seeking \u201cto lead us to a civil war in Venezuela.\u201d The commutation of that sentence is a slap in Mr. Cabello\u2019s face, a further reason for even Chavista generals not to be loyal to Mr. Maduro.Sources with relatives in the regime who are closely tied to Mr. Cabello tell me that he was not consulted before Mr. Maduro decided to free Mr. L\u00f3pez. These sources speculate Mr. Maduro authorized the release on advice from former Spanish prime minister       Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Rodr\u00edguez       Zapatero, who visited Mr. L\u00f3pez in prison last month. One theory is that Mr. Maduro hopes Spain will grant him asylum if he is forced from power.What comes next? The opposition plans an unofficial, and therefore nonbinding, plebiscite Sunday on Mr. Maduro\u2019s constituent-assembly plan, and the message is likely to be clear. Domestic polling puts the president\u2019s approval rating in single digits. Although the regime does not renew opponents\u2019 passports, the plebiscite will accept expired passports as identification. The military is fracturing and overtly abandoning its commander in chief. The regime is fighting to stay in power but divided into warring factions.This is not a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat; it is instead a transition back to democratic order under the constitution the Chavistas themselves drafted. The release of Mr. L\u00f3pez, while intended to prolong the life of the regime, will likely accelerate the ouster of Mr. Maduro and his cohorts who have ruled by decree. Only then can Venezuela begin the process of reconciliation and development.Ms. Neumann, a Venezuela native, is president of the political risk consultancy Asymmetrica and a contracted consultant to the U.S. government on Venezuela.

Ever since the endowments were created in 1965, they have been a focus of ire for defenders of fiscal prudence and high cultural standards.In the 1980s, the chief complaint was against the efflorescence of obscenity and leftish political posturing: the pornographic photographs of       Robert Mapplethorpe       or the antics of \u201cperformance artist\u201d       Karen Finley,        who pranced about naked skirling about patriarchy and capitalism.But \u201cTen Good Reasons to Eliminate Funding for the National Endowment for the Arts,\u201d a 1997 Heritage Foundation report, got to the nub of the issue. The NEA is \u201cwelfare for cultural elitists,\u201d Heritage observed, and the same can be said for the NEH. There is nothing wrong with cultural elitists per se, but why should the taxpayers pick up their tab?A new report from the Illinois-based initiative Open the Books provides an eye-opening look into the size of that tab. The study includes virtually every grant the NEA and NEH have made since 2016, and additional details about the endowments\u2019 activities as far back as 2009. This includes grants to 71 entities with assets over $1 billion, and one grant to a California enterprise that celebrates the work of a Japanese-American artist best known for declaring: \u201cI consider       Osama bin Laden       as one of the people that I admire.\u201dSince its founding in 2011, Open the Books has pursued the elusive goal of governmental transparency by collecting reams of data about local, state and federal expenditures. All that information is then made freely accessible online. Their motto: \u201cEvery Dime. Online. In Real Time.\u201dThe group\u2019s earlier initiatives include reports on federal payments to so-called sanctuary cities ($26.74 billion in 2016) and the eight superrich Ivy League universities (nearly $42 billion in federal payments, benefits, and tax advantages over the last several years). Harvard alone sits atop an endowment of $36 billion, and altogether the Ivy League controls tax-exempt endowment funds of some $120 billion, equivalent to $2 million per undergraduate. Yet taxpayers are footing the bill for massive subsidies for these institutions, where the cost of attendance now approaches $70,000 per annum.The latest Open the Books report reveals that in 2016 federal arts agencies dispensed more than $440 million into the collective maw of their clients. Nearly half, $210 million, went to recipients in only 10 states\u2014a predictable lineup of progressive coastal outfits, mostly clustered in California and New York.The Metropolitan Museum of Art is a public charity commanding assets worth nearly $4 billion. The museum\u2019s annual gala is a star-studded event, what one publicist called an \u201cATM for the Met.\u201d The Met raised some $300 million last year, yet it has received more than $1 million from the NEH since 2009. Why?There is also the issue of what public funds are being spent to support. Doubtless many initiatives could be worthy, but a lot of the funded projects are inane, repellent or both.In the inane category, consider a $10,000 grant in 2016 to Borderlands Theater in Tucson, Ariz. The money went to a series of \u201csite-responsive performances celebrating the saguaro cactus.\u201d Yep, you read that right. Attendees stand or sit with a saguaro cactus for an hour in the middle of the desert to discover what the cactus can teach them. Then they share their experiences on social media. #IFellAsleep?Many projects are repellent, including several that cannot be described in a family newspaper. But how about this? The New York       Shakespeare       Festival has been much in the public eye this summer for its production of \u201c      Julius Caesar,       \u201d in which the title character is made to look like the president. One Associated Press report describes the carnage: \u201cHe looks like       Donald Trump       .\u00a0.\u00a0. moves like Trump .\u00a0.\u00a0. is knifed to death on stage, blood staining his white shirt.\u201d Over the past several years the festival has received some $30 million in taxpayer grants, including more than $600,000 from the NEA. Is political propaganda the right use of taxpayer dollars?Mr. Trump\u2019s fiscal 2018 budget proposes zeroing out NEA and NEH, but Congress slightly increased spending on both in its recent fiscal 2017 omnibus bill. Why? I suspect it is largely because the spouse of every congressman sits on the board of various nonprofit arts organizations. Some local feminist pottery collective gets $10,000 from the NEA: \u201cYou can\u2019t cut that, honey!\u201dIt isn\u2019t much when you think of the $4 trillion federal budget, but this sort of spending adds up. It also leaves the government hostage to exactly the sort of corrupt patronage the Founders warned us about. The investigative work of Open the Books has fomented a revolution in fiscal transparency.

Honda notified the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the fatality, which occurred June 18, 2016, at a private residence in Hialeah, Fla., the auto maker said.The man, who wasn\u2019t the vehicle\u2019s owner, died from injuries sustained in the rupture the following day, Honda said.\u201cThis latest tragedy is a reminder of the serious nature of this recall,\u201d a NHTSA spokeswoman said, adding that certain model-year 2001-2003 Honda and Acura vehicles show a far higher risk of ruptures during air-bag deployment. \u201cIt\u2019s essential to safety that high-risk inflaters are replaced immediately,\u201d she said.Separately, a federal judge in Detroit on Monday said he planned to appoint Harvard University law professor and longtime mediator Eric Green as a special master overseeing two victim compensation funds totaling nearly $1 billion related to Takata\u2019s air bags.The funds were conditions of Takata\u2019s agreement in the U.S. earlier this year to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing in its handling of the air bags. Mr. Green replaces former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller, who withdrew from the assignment after being tapped as the special counsel investigating Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible coordination between Moscow\u2019s efforts and the Trump campaign.Honda, meanwhile, didn\u2019t provide further details on the victim in last year\u2019s air-bag rupture.The Japanese auto maker said the \u201cabsolute cause of death may never be fully determined,\u201d but still considered it the 11th fatality in Honda vehicles linked to Takata air-bag ruptures.The car has been included in multiple recalls and a separate safety campaign related to the driver-side air-bag inflater since 2009, and a dozen recall notices were mailed to registered owners of the vehicle during a nearly seven-year span before the June 2016 incident, Honda said. Honda said no recall repair was performed on the vehicle, according to its records.Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. and Japan in June amid mounting liabilities linked to millions of air bags that risk rupturing and spraying shrapnel in vehicle cabins. The Japanese automotive supplier pleaded guilty this year to criminal wire fraud for providing misleading testing reports on the air bags to auto makers, settling a U.S. Justice Department probe.The defective air bags have been linked to at least 17 deaths globally. In the U.S. alone, regulators have said 19 auto makers will eventually recall roughly 42 million vehicles with as many as nearly 70 million of the faulty devices. Older air bags with prolonged exposure to heat and humidity are at the greatest risk of rupturing, officials have found. A chemical in the air-bag inflaters can destabilize over time and when exposed to moisture, leading to ruptures.Takata has a tentative deal to sell operations to Key Safety Systems Inc., a Michigan rival owned by a Chinese firm. Proceeds are expected to help pay $850 million owed to auto makers shouldering recall costs, a commitment Takata agreed to as part of its plea deal.Write to Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 18:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/honda-confirms-another-death-linked-to-takata-air-bag-1499713538", "news_title": "Honda Confirms Another Death Linked to Takata Air Bag ", "keywords": " air bag, death,defect, fatality, nhtsa, rupture, takata,Takata,JP:7312,Honda Motor,HMC,7312.TO,corporate crime,legal action,product,consumer safety,corporate,industrial news,product recalls,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,motor vehicles,passenger cars,motor vehicle parts,automotive"}, {"content": "ISLAMABAD\u2014Pakistan\u2019s prime minister rejected calls to resign and will continue to fight allegations of corruption, aides said Monday, after a criminal investigation found that he and his children were living beyond their means.Lawyers said the Supreme Court could disqualify the prime minister from office now, but is more likely to send the case to a trial court on corruption charges. If convicted, that would be grounds for disqualification, or removal from office, according to lawyers. The Supreme Court will hold further hearings next week ahead of deciding what to do.The investigation report\u2019s contents, presented to the Supreme Court on Monday, were rejected by Prime Minister       Nawaz Sharif\u2019s       aides as \u201cnot based on any evidence.\u201d Amid media reports about the probe\u2019s conclusions, the aides confirmed the authenticity of the four-page conclusion document from the investigation into the finances of the Pakistani leader and his children.

Opposition leader       Imran Khan,        who renewed his call for the prime minister\u2019s resignation, said the process will strengthen democracy in Pakistan by making rulers accountable.\u201cThis family has been looting the country for 30 years.

Documents from the leak showed the name of three of Mr. Sharif\u2019s children as owners of apartments in one of London\u2019s swankiest areas. Three-time Prime Minister Mr. Sharif says he isn\u2019t an owner, and the property was acquired from the proceeds of his family\u2019s longstanding business activities by his two sons.Mr. Sharif\u2019s daughter Maryam, an apparent political heir and also named in the offshore documents, says she was only a trustee, not an owner. She said Monday on             Twitter                   that no public money is being used to fight the case and that \u201cevery contradiction will not only be contested but decimated\u201d in the Supreme Court.Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court began hearings into the London property in 2016 and earlier this year Mr. Sharif narrowly escaped being forced from office after two of the five judges on the case said he should be disqualified. Instead, an investigation was ordered by the court, which reported Monday.That investigation report, by a team that included military intelligence officials, financial regulators and anticorruption officials, concluded that \u201cthere exists a significant disparity between the wealth declared by the respondents and the means through which the respondents had generated income from known/declared sources,\u201d according to press reports confirmed by Mr. Sharif\u2019s aides. The respondents were the prime minister, sons       Hussain       and       Hassan       and Maryam.Mr. Sharif\u2019s five-year term as prime minister is due to end in June 2018. Experts said the allegations could damage Mr. Sharif\u2019s showing at the next election, though his party hopes it can gain sympathy as political martyrs. His party suggests they are the victims of a conspiracy. Privately they say this involves the judiciary, the opposition and the military establishment. The military denies any political role.Pakistan\u2019s history is marked by coups and when there have been elected governments they have often been ousted before the end of their terms. The only time an elected government completed its term and handed over to another democratic administration was 2013.\u201cIf the law is allowed to take its course, even if that culminates in the disqualification of the prime minister, I think the democratic system will sustain,\u201d said       Ahmed Bilal Mehboob,        president of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency, an Islamabad-based think tank.Write to Saeed Shah at saeed.shah@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Defiant Sharif Vows to Fight Corruption Allegations.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 18:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pakistan-prime-minister-rejects-resigning-after-corruption-probe-recommends-he-face-trial-1499714396", "news_title": "Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Says He Won\u2019t Resign ", "keywords": "corruption,crime,imran khan,investigation,nawaz sharif,pakistan,pakistan tehreek-e-insaf,polticis,terrorism,Nawaz Sharif,political,general news,national,public security,legal action,financial crime,political appointments,terminations,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,judicial branch"}, {"content": "Missouri\u2019s governor is making a push to combat violent crime in St. Louis, calling the Gateway to the West \u201cthe most dangerous city in the United States of America.\u201dRepublican Gov.

The move prompted a rebuke from acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika, the only Trump administration official so far in place at a federal banking regulator, and a threat by a top House Republican to hold Mr. Cordray in contempt of Congress.Some Republicans are considering the use of a legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act to quickly undo the arbitration rule. Republicans have used the tool to revoke more than a dozen Obama-era regulations.The CFPB\u2019s rule prevents companies from including in consumer contracts any arbitration clause that blocks class-action lawsuits, though it doesn\u2019t ban arbitration entirely. Such clauses are commonly used for a range of financial products, including credit cards, certain auto loans, payday loans and private student loans. Financial companies will have about eight months to comply with the rule.Consumer groups have backed the regulation. They say arbitration diminishes legal protections for everyday people and prevents them from joining together to bring class-action lawsuits.Critics in the financial industry and Congress say arbitration provides a faster and more cost-effective way to resolve disputes with consumers.\u201cThis bureaucratic rule will harm American consumers but thrill class-action trial attorneys,\u201d House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) said in a statement. \u201cThis anti-consumer rule should be thoroughly rejected by Congress under the Congressional Review Act.\u201d\u201cThe CFPB\u2019s brazen finalization of the arbitration rule is a prime example of an agency gone rogue,\u201d U.S. Chamber of Commerce leaders wrote in a joint statement on Monday, adding that \u201carbitration is faster and cheaper for consumers.\u201dThe final version of the CFPB rule hasn\u2019t been substantially changed from the draft issued last year.Mr. Cordray on Monday said the bureau was proceeding despite Republican efforts to block it.\u201cMy obligation\u2026is to act for the protection of consumers and in the public interest. In deciding to issue this rule that is what I believe I have done,\u201d Mr. Cordray said during a conference call with reporters.Mr. Noreika, appointed by President Donald Trump in May as interim comptroller, condemned the move in a letter Monday asking the CFPB director to provide to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency the data the CFPB used to support the rule.\u201cA variety of OCC staff have reviewed the CFPB\u2019s arbitration proposal from this perspective and have expressed concerns about its potential impact on the institutions that make up the federal banking system and its customers,\u201d Mr. Noreika said. He added the OCC was concerned the rule \u201cmay potentially decrease the products and services offered to consumers, while increasing their costs.\u201dMr. Noreika\u2019s letter cites a section of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law that gives a regulatory body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the ability to delay rules by the CFPB for up to three months. Mr. Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary,       Steven Mnuchin,        heads FSOC.A top congressional Republican warned Mr. Cordray against completing the measure last week in anticipation of Monday\u2019s move, suggesting the House could hold the bureau\u2019s chief in contempt. Mr. Hensarling, the powerful head of the House Financial Services Committee, instructed Mr. Cordray not to complete the rule until the CFPB first complied with a series of records requests from Congress related to its work on the rule, including an April subpoena.\u201cAny effort by you or another bureau employee to promulgate any rule affecting arbitration...may lead to contempt proceedings,\u201d Mr. Hensarling wrote in a July 5 letter to Mr. Cordray reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.Critics of the CFPB have repeatedly asked Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Cordray, whose term is up in July 2018, but the administration hasn\u2019t acted on those requests, which have come amid legal uncertainty about how much power the president has to remove the bureau director. A pending court case is examining the issue.Some Republicans are also reluctant to oust Mr. Cordray in a manner that could boost his political career should he decide to run for office in the future.A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.The CFPB says many consumers are unaware of forced arbitration clauses, according to a study the agency released in 2015 prior to proposing a rule. The regulator also argues that financial companies use such clauses to \u201cblock\u201d consumers from group lawsuits, where they could get more money back.Forced arbitration \u201callows companies to sidestep the judicial system, avoid big refunds and continue to pursue profitable practices that may violate the law and harm large numbers of consumers,\u201d Mr. Cordray said.He pointed to regulators\u2019 action against Wells Fargo & Co. for creating millions of fake accounts tied to the names of customers who didn\u2019t know there were forced arbitration clauses in many of those contracts.\u201cConsumers should be able to stand up for themselves and pursue their own legal rights without having to wait on the government\u201d to bring an enforcement action, Mr. Cordray said.Arbitration agreements have been upheld by the Supreme Court in a series of pro-business rulings in recent years. In turning away a variety of challenges, the justices repeatedly have cited the Federal Arbitration Act, a longstanding federal law that says arbitration agreements are generally \u201cvalid, irrevocable and enforceable.\u201dThe CFPB relied on the Dodd-Frank law, which required it to study mandatory arbitration clauses. The CFPB in its Monday announcement said the law gave it the authority to write rules in \u201cthe public interest\u201d based on its studies.Companies over time have expanded their use of arbitration clauses to send consumer and employment disputes to private dispute resolution and keep the cases out of court.The CFPB issued its arbitration rule amid a continuing legal battle about whether the bureau\u2019s structure is constitutional. An 11-judge appeals court panel heard oral arguments in May on whether Congress made the CFPB too independent from the president, who can\u2019t remove the agency\u2019s director at will. A decision is expected in the coming months and the case may ultimately land at the Supreme Court.While Monday\u2019s rule generally applies to consumer financial products such as bank accounts and credit cards, there are some exemptions. Notably, it doesn\u2019t extend to stockbrokers and mutual-fund managers regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Write to Rachel Witkowski at rachel.witkowski@wsj.com, Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com and Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Arbitration Rule Sets Up GOP Showdown.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 18:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cfpb-completes-rule-allowing-class-action-lawsuits-against-banks-1499712133", "news_title": "Consumer Agency\u2019s Arbitration Move Sets Off GOP Showdown", "keywords": "arbitration,cfpb,class action suits,consumer financial protection bureau ,financial-services firms ,Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,Wells Fargo &,WFC,Richard Cordray,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,class action,settlements,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "J.C.

The yield settled at 2.371% Monday, down from 2.393% Friday. But it was up from this year\u2019s low of 2.135% on June 26, one day before the recent selloff started. Yields rise as bond prices fall.At the same time, the difference between the yields on the 10-year and 30-year Treasurys recently hit its lowest since 2009. A shrinking gap means investors get a lower premium to own the 30-year bond, which signals their doubts that inflation will rise and threaten the value of long-term debt.Investors have long confronted a trade-off when dabbling in long-term bonds. When interest rates fall, prices of these bonds rise more sharply than their shorter-term peers, rewarding bond buyers. Yet bondholders suffer losses if prices fall and yields rise rapidly.\u201cThe bond market is pricing in low inflation,\u2019\u2019 said       Thomas Byrne,        director of fixed income at Wealth Strategies & Management LLC. \u201cInflation, here and abroad, will ultimately determine long-term rates and central bank policies.\u201dThe recent selloff is stirring up a fresh debate over whether long-dated government debt is riskier than bonds with shorter maturities, a split that highlights the crosscurrents complicating investors\u2019 outlook for bonds.Government bonds in the U.S. have sold off along with their peers in many other developed countries since late June, following signals from major central banks that a broad improvement in the global economy may allow them to pull back ultraloose monetary stimulus. Easy-money policies have played a key role in driving bond prices to historically high levels following the financial crisis.At the same time, inflation remains subdued, tempering a major threat to long-term government bonds. Over the past few months, some measures have showed inflation pressure easing in the U.S., with some indicators falling below the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. Friday\u2019s jobs report exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations, yet a gauge of wage growth remained tame.Inflation chips away investors\u2019 purchasing power from their bonds\u2019 fixed payments. As a result, the 30-year Treasury bond, the longest maturity in the Treasury debt market, is the most sensitive to the inflation outlook. The U.S. consumer-price index report for June is scheduled to be released this Friday.In a major sign some investors expect inflation to stay contained, the yield premium investors demanded to hold the 30-year Treasury bond relative to the 10-year Treasury note fell to 0.516 percentage point on July 3, the lowest level since January 2009, according to Tradeweb. It ticked up to 0.55 percentage point Monday.On Monday, the 30-year Treasury yield was 2.924%, still below the 3.067% where it closed at the end of 2016.The premium decline has surprised some traders and analysts because it happened as the recent selloff has driven up the 10-year yield\u2019s premium relative to that of the two-year note.The 30-year break-even rate, the yield premium of the 30-year Treasury bond to the 30-year Treasury inflation-protected security, was 1.86 percentage points Monday, according to Tradeweb. That suggests investors expect inflation in the U.S. to run at an annualized 1.86% rate over the next three decades.While the break-even rate has risen from this year\u2019s low of 1.804% set on June 20, it was below this year\u2019s high of 2.158% in February.\u201cInflation has been too low and Congress has struggled to pass legislation to promote economic growth,\u2019\u2019 said       Andrew Pace,        vice president at Performance Trust Capital Partners LLC. \u201cWithout these two issues getting resolved, it will be hard\u201d for the rise in long-term Treasury bond yields to continue, he said.Treasury bonds maturing in more than 25 years posted a 4% return this year through July 7, including price changes and interest payments, beating the 1.4% return on overall Treasury debt, according to data from Bloomberg Barclays bond indexes.Over a greater time span, buying long-term bonds has been rewarding. The 30-year Treasury bond yield closed at a high of 15.252% in October 1981. It has since been declining, driven partly by moderation of inflation pressure. The yield closed at a record low of 2.109% in July 2016.And even as the 30-year bond yield remains low by historical standards, it is much higher than yields offered from 30-year bonds in Germany, the U.K. and Japan. That could continue to draw buyers, keeping a lid on yields, said money managers.Meanwhile, long-term Treasurys still attract investors who need high-quality and long-term assets to match their long-term obligations, such as pension funds and insurance firms.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 18:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-market-predicts-low-inflation-1499724896", "news_title": "Bond Market Predicts Low Inflation", "keywords": "Andrew Pace,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "Software company             Citrix Systems Inc.

SNAP 1.63%       shares fell below their initial public offering price for the first time, a setback for one of the most anticipated U.S. IPOs in recent years.Snap closed down 1.1% at $16.99 on Monday, below its March 1 IPO price of $17\u2014a sign that the parent of disappearing-message app Snapchat is losing popularity among investors as a hot new tech stock. Snap was valued at more than $20 billion at the time of its debut, making it the biggest U.S.-listed IPO since             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.       in 2014.Many investors scoop up shares of newly public companies betting that they will offer outsize returns. From 2014 through 2016, companies that went public each year have on average outperformed the S&P 500 in that calendar year. Investors who bought shares of Snap are now facing losses.It isn\u2019t unusual for an IPO to dip below its offer price, and Snap\u2019s drop doesn\u2019t mean its shares will keep sliding. As of July 7, 45% of U.S.-listed companies that went public in 2017 have closed below their IPO prices at some point. More than one-third were still below as of July 7, according to Dealogic.Back in 2012, shares of             Facebook Inc.       closed slightly above their IPO price of $38 in their first day of trading, and closed below it the next day. It took more than a year for shares to return above that level. On Monday, Facebook\u2019s stock closed at $153.50.Twitter\u2019s       stock traded above its $26 IPO price for nearly two years before closing below it for the first time in August 2015. Though shares bounced back slightly in the following months, they have traded below their offer price for roughly the past year and a half. Shares closed at $18.08 Monday.Snap\u2019s decline comes as both the stock market and this year\u2019s batch of IPOs are performing well. U.S.-listed companies that went public in 2017 are up roughly 11% from their offer prices, and tech IPOs are up about 19% as of July 7, according to Dealogic, while the S&P 500 is up about 8% this year through Friday. The S&P 500 and its tech sector both rose on Monday.However, Snap\u2019s fall below $17 a share comes shortly after another high-profile IPO stumble. In late June,             Blue Apron Holdings Inc.struggled to find buyers in its IPO and ended up pricing shares at $10 apiece, the bottom of its lowered target range. The meal-kit delivery service\u2019s stock closed its first day of trading at its IPO price, but has finished below $10 a share in each subsequent trading day.While IPOs in the U.S. have rebounded in 2017, the number of private companies valued at $1 billion or more has risen in recent years and now stands at more than 160. Some of these companies are likely to go public in the second half of the year, but few big-name startups are expected, according to some bankers and stock-exchange officials.Snap was widely seen by analysts, bankers and company executives as a test of the IPO market for other richly valued firms considering going public. Private companies largely avoided the public markets last year because of a winter selloff and potentially disruptive elections in Europe and the U.S.\u2014opting instead to rely on cash from venture-capital investors.Last year was the slowest for U.S.-listed tech IPOs since 2009 in terms of number of deals and dollars raised, according to Dealogic data. The money raised by tech IPOs so far in 2017 exceeds 2016\u2019s full-year total.Ahead of Snap\u2019s IPO, some investors were skeptical about the company\u2019s growth potential and its ability to ramp up revenue per user, but Snap priced its offering above expectations and jumped 44% its first day of trading.After shares touched above $29 in early March, investors tempered their enthusiasm. Snap\u2019s first quarterly results as a public company in May exacerbated the stock\u2019s pullback\u2014Snap tumbled more than 21% on May 11, a day after it reported a bigger-than-expected loss and struggled to keep adding new users at its previous pace.On June 15, Snap shares fell alongside declines in the tech sector, flirting with their IPO price several times before settling right at $17.00.Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Stephen Ju on Monday lowered his target price for Snap shares to $25, from $30, saying he expects Snap\u2019s revenue per user to grow more slowly than he previously thought. Another reason to expect some volatility in Snap shares in the near term: Restrictions on stock sales by company employees and other insiders are lifted later this month, he said in a note to investors.Corrections & Amplifications   Shares of Facebook Inc. closed slightly above their IPO price of $38 in their first day of trading, and closed below it the next day.

This summer\u2019s Pavilion was designed by       Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9,        originally from Burkina Faso but trained and now working in Berlin. He was selected by the Serpentine\u2019s artistic director,       Hans Ulrich Obrist,        and its CEO,       Yana Peel,        along with an advisory group that included architects       Richard Rogers       and       David Adjaye.       Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9 joins a distinguished lineup that began with Zaha Hadid in 2000, when the Pavilion concept was launched by the Serpentine\u2019s then-director,       Julia Peyton-Jones.The requirements are relatively simple: a Pavilion of about 1,000 square feet to be used as a public and learning space by day and a platform for live programs by night. Private and corporate support pays the costs, along with proceeds from the anticipated sale of the building (usually to a private collector) at summer\u2019s end. Past Pavilions have often made bold architectural statements, taking advantage of the chance to play at the ultimate architectural vanity project. Happily, Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9\u2019s building is both more self-confident and more accommodating than that of various predecessors.A delicate-looking space-frame made of steel supports the 32-foot cantilever of the elegant circular wooden roof that almost appears to float. Taken together, the space-frame looks like the trunk and the roof the canopy of a large tree. And Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9 has said that the inspiration was a tree in his native village that serves as a community gathering place. From a distance, the canopy articulates the building\u2019s shape, while close up its natural wood slats, spaced apart in a triangular pattern, almost appear to dematerialize as they invite the daylight in.An undulating blue wall composed of rows of triangular wooden modules creates and partially encloses an interior space. We recognize the simplicity of Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9\u2019s use of wood because it appears to be stained, rather than painted, its rich indigo color. Each triangle is formed by eight slats of diminishing size and positioned to leave small rectangular spaces for penetration of light (or to accommodate the safe exploration of a small child\u2019s hand). There\u2019s a handmade quality to these forms that disguises the reality that they were, in fact, prefabricated off-site.It\u2019s difficult to miss the lyrical play among the rounded roof and wall forms with the insistent repetitive triangles of the supporting steel struts, those of the natural wood roof and the deep-blue undulating walls.Those curved walls feel more like screens, providing both a sense of enclosure and and welcoming embrace for visitors. It is this sense of transparency that is one of the Pavilion\u2019s primary themes. Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9 has said that he often uses his \u201cown experience of growing up in a place that is very hot and dry as an impetus for design. For this reason, my projects have a strong focus on climate and energy.\u2026It is important to introduce structures that embrace natural ventilation and daylight not only for under-developed areas but also for places like London.\u201dIt\u2019s impressive that a building so small can feel so capacious and so at one with its surroundings\u2014yet another way in which this year\u2019s Pavilion feels distinct from many of its predecessors, which were so obviously asking to be seen as visible marks on the bucolic landscape of Kensington Gardens and the Serpentine waterway that gives the gallery its name.Unassumingly, the center of the canopy roof funnels rainwater, via a large translucent plastic tube, into an almost separate central courtyard additionally articulated by a covering of small, water-absorbing pebbles. The architect says that he has designed this so that \u201cthe symbolic rain collection puts an emphasis on water as a vital element for sustaining life.\u201d This little central space includes small concrete seating pads, while other seating is provided along the curving blue wall enclosures.According to Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9, in the Burkina Faso village where he grew up \u201cbuilding is a communal activity. Whenever someone needs a new house or has to have their home repaired, members of the community would come to help.\u201d Park visitors here appear to sense that concept of community as they bask in the casual comfort of a building that is the latest version of one of London\u2019s must-see destinations in summer.\u2014       Mr. Freudenheim,        a former art-museum director, served as the assistant secretary for museums at the Smithsonian.Appeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-10 17:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-the-serpentine-gallery-architecture-branches-out-1499723074", "news_title": "At the Serpentine Gallery, Architecture Branches Out", "keywords": "Serpentine Gallery,Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9,architecture,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,technical services,architects,surveyors,business,consumer services,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "To call the Pollyseeds a supergroup misses its most appealing feature. True, it includes pianist       Robert Glasper,        multi-instrumentalist       Terrace Martin       and saxophonist       Kamasi Washington,        but over the years the term has come to imply a mercenary aspect, as if the ace musicians in such a group have allied to form a marketable commercial enterprise. For       Mr. Martin,        the project\u2019s ringleader, the Pollyseeds is a celebration of community in which all the players get a chance to shine, as evidenced by \u201cSounds of       Crenshaw       Vol.. 1\u201d (Ropeadope), out on Friday.The album is a modernized, easygoing, smile-inducing blend of late \u201970s and early \u201980s soul and R&B. Mr. Martin is best known for his work as a producer and performer on       Kendrick Lamar\u2019s       \u201cTo Pimp a Butterfly,\u201d but he\u2019s released several albums that explore different African-American musical styles. His 2016 \u201cVelvet Portraits\u201d tapped into mellow soul and smooth jazz not only with Messrs. Glasper and Washington but vocalist Lalah Hathaway, bassist       Stephen Bruner       (better known as Thundercat) and drummer       Ronald Bruner Jr.      , among others. \u201cVelvet Portraits\u201d was nominated for a Best R&B Album Grammy. (\u201cLalah Hathaway Live\u201d won the award. It was produced by Messrs. Glasper and Martin.)As his Pollyseeds colleagues, the 38-year-old Mr. Martin chose musicians he\u2019s been playing with for years\u2014including Mr. Washington, whom he met as a teen in the Young World Stage All-Stars, a group nurtured by drummer and hard-bop innovator       Billy Higgins       that came together in Los Angeles\u2019s 1990s pay-it-forward jazz scene. Among the featured musicians on \u201cSounds of Crenshaw Vol.. 1\u201d are drummer       Trevor Lawrence Jr.      , bassist       Brandon Eugene Owens       and guitarist       Marlon Williams,        longtime Martin associates. His father, Curly Martin, plays drums on the swaying ballad \u201cBelieve,\u201d and vocalist       Wyann Vaughn       is the daughter of       Wanda Hutchinson       of the Emotions, who sang on \u201cVelvet Portraits.\u201dFor the new album, Mr. Martin, who is now on tour in       Herbie Hancock\u2019s       band, had in mind the kind of supple cohesiveness provided by the rhythm sections on classic recordings featuring Motown\u2019s Funk Brothers, L.A.\u2019s Wrecking Crew and Philadelphia\u2019s TSOP. Thus, the tracks on \u201cSounds of Crenshaw Vol.. 1\u201d build from deep grooves dug by musicians who are at ease with one another and can be assertive without steely tension. On \u201cUp and Away,\u201d Mr. Lawrence\u2019s fat-bottom percussion is sweetened by Mr. Martin on a variety of synthesizers, while on \u201cIntentions\u201d\u2014sung by rapper Chachi with help from Ms. Vaughn and newcomer Rose Gold\u2014Mr. Martin creates a rubbery synthetic rhythm section that\u2019s bolstered by funk chording by Mr. Williams and chiming electric piano by       Craig Brockman.If the Pollyseeds sound particularly tight on \u201cMama D/Leimert Park,\u201d it may be because Mr. Martin is playing all the instruments and vocalizing with the aid of a vocoder. Perfectly applied modern sounds bring an old-school template up to the moment.As for Mr. Glasper, he and Mr. Martin reworked       Janet Jackson\u2019s       1987 song \u201cFunny How Time Flies (When You\u2019re Having Fun),\u201d stripping away the pop verses and using the repeating staccato chorus as the jump-off for a track featuring subtle shadings by Messrs. Glasper and Williams and an explosion by Snarky Puppy drummer       Robert Searight.       Mr. Glasper\u2019s Fender       Rhodes       electric piano is the foundation for the instrumental \u201cChef E Dubble\u201d with tenor sax by Mr. Washington.Though the album is heavy with midtempo funk that occasionally wanders too close to smooth-jazz turf, some of its best moments are provided by expressive ballads, including Ms. Vaughn\u2019s \u201cYour Space\u201d and the gritty \u201cFeelings of the World\u201d with its extended solo on electric guitar by Mr. Williams. \u201cWake Up\u201d is a lovely duet featuring Mr. Martin on soprano sax and       Kenneth Crouch       on a grand piano.When we spoke by phone last week, Mr. Martin, who was in London with Mr. Hancock, said he intended for the Pollyseeds to be a continuing project\u2014\u201ca marathon,\u201d he added. A tour of Japan is planned for September. As the title \u201cSounds of Crenshaw Vol. 1\u201d indicates, more recordings by the collective are forthcoming, thus ensuring further explorations of soul, R&B, funk and jazz by the gifted Mr. Martin and his friend-filled collective.\u2014       Mr. Fusilli       is the Journal\u2019s rock and pop music critic.

Mr. Trump and others who helped arrange the meeting\u2014which was also attended by then-senior campaign aides       Jared Kushner       and       Paul Manafort      \u2014described a complex series of events leading up to the June 9, 2016, conversation at Trump Tower in New York City.In the spring of 2016, the Russian lawyer,       Natalia Veselnitskaya,        approached Emin Agalarov, a singer who together with his father\u2014Azerbaijani-Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov\u2014helped sponsor the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, co-owned by President Trump. The younger Mr. Agalarov, who goes by just Emin in his professional capacity, asked his publicist, Rob Goldstone, to set up a meeting for Ms. Veselnitskaya with Donald Trump Jr.\u201cThe lawyer had apparently stated she had some information regarding illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee which she believed Mr. Trump Jr. might find important,\u201d Mr. Goldstone said in a statement Monday. \u201cI reached out to Donald Trump Jr. and he agreed to squeeze us into a very tight meeting schedule.\u201dIn the meeting, Ms. Veselnitskaya briefly discussed alleged Russian contributions in the 2016 campaign before turning to the Magnitsky Act, a law targeting Russian human-rights abusers that she has campaigned against on behalf of her clients.At that point, Mr. Trump cut off the meeting, according to both his account and that of Mr. Goldstone. Both men said there was no follow-up on the subject.A person close to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign recalls receiving an email around the time of the meeting with the Russian attorney asking about the campaign\u2019s stance on the Magnitsky Act. The person couldn\u2019t recall if there was a response to the email, or whether it was before or after the meeting took place.Ms. Veselnitskaya said in a statement Monday that she met with Donald Trump Jr. in her capacity as a private attorney.\u201cThe purpose of my brief meeting with Mr. Trump Jr. was to explain the facts of my client\u2019s position,\u201d she said. She said she has also met with members of Congress to discuss the Magnitsky Act on behalf of her clients.\u201cI have never acted on behalf of the Russian government and have never discussed any of these matters with any representative of the Russian government,\u201d she said.The White House sought Monday to cast the meeting as commonplace.\u201cI\u2019ve been on several campaigns,\u201d and such a meeting would have been standard practice in any of them, spokeswoman       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       said. She said Donald Trump Jr. \u201cdid not collude with anyone to influence\u201d the outcome of the election.Both Ms. Veselnitskaya and the Agalarov family have longstanding ties to the Kremlin.Ms. Veselnitskaya counts among her clients state-owned companies and relatives of top government officials. Her husband previously served as deputy transportation minister of the Moscow region.The elder Mr. Agalarov\u2019s real-estate company has won several state contracts in Russia, and President       Vladimir Putin       of Russia awarded him in 2013 the \u201cOrder of Honor of the Russian Federation,\u201d a high-profile civilian prize.The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Mr. Putin ordered a campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. A special counsel appointed by the Justice Department earlier this year is investigating whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Moscow.Mr. Putin has denied that the Russian government meddled in the U.S. election. Mr. Trump has denied that there was any collusion and has said he doubts the intelligence community\u2019s assessment, saying last week, \u201cNo one really knows for sure.\u201dDmitry Peskov,        a spokesman for Mr. Putin, said Monday the Kremlin doesn\u2019t know Ms. Veselnitskaya. The Kremlin \u201ccannot keep track of every Russian lawyer and their meetings within the country or abroad,\u201d he said.The June meeting with a Russian lawyer wasn\u2019t the first time the younger Mr. Trump has been linked to Russia. In October\u2014about a month before Election Day\u2014Mr. Trump addressed a dinner hosted by a French think tank whose founder and his wife are allies of the Russian government in efforts to end the war in Syria. He was likely paid at least $50,000 for the speech.Donald Trump Jr. regularly travels internationally to pursue Trump Organization real-estate projects, and has emphasized the importance of Russian business. The president has said that his companies wouldn\u2019t make new business deals overseas while he is in office.\u201cIn terms of high-end product influx into the U.S., Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. said in a 2008 interview with a trade publication. \u201cWe see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\u201dIn 2013, the Agalarovs spent millions of dollars sponsoring the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, which the elder Mr. Trump attended.\u201cDo you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?\u201d the elder Mr. Trump tweeted in June 2013.Mr. Putin didn\u2019t attend, but both Mr. Agalarov and Mr. Trump sought to lay the foundation for future business dealings.Mr. Trump agreed to appear in a music video for Emin that also featured Miss Universe contestants. Emin\u2019s website notes: \u201cHe was the first person ever to persuade Donald Trump to appear in a music video.\u201dThe elder Mr. Agalarov and Mr. Trump subsequently agreed to a real-estate deal for a Moscow tower, but the project was stalled by Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and subsequent victory.At the end of the pageant weekend, Mr. Trump tweeted: \u201cI had a great weekend with you and your family. You have done a FANTASTIC job. TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next. EMIN was WOW!\u201dEmin has said he has maintained contact with the president since his victory last fall. In a March interview with Forbes magazine, he said his family received a handwritten note from Mr. Trump in November after congratulating him on his victory.\u201cNow that he ran and was elected, he does not forget his friends,\u201d he said.\u2014Brett Forrest, Nicole Hong and Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Trump\u2019s Son Hires Lawyer, Defends Meeting.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 17:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-defends-donald-trump-jr-s-meeting-with-russian-lawyer-1499720320", "news_title": "Donald Trump Jr. Hires Lawyer and Pledges to Work With Congress ", "keywords": " 2016 election,democratic national committee, donald trump,donald trump jr.,donald trump jr. meeting, hillary clinton, jared kushner, magnitsky act,natalia veselnitskaya, paul manafort, russian lawyer, sarah huckabee sanders,vladimir putin,Donald Trump,Natalia Veselnitskaya,Sarah Huckabee Sanders,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "When veteran New York actor       James Kiberd       was approached last year about the lead role in the off-Broadway-bound drama \u201cThe Crusade of       Connor Stephens,       \u201d he saw it as a significant opportunity.The show, by New York playwright       Dewey Moss,        examines faith, family and homophobia through the prism of a small-town Texas family. Mr. Kiberd was pegged to play Big Jim, a charismatic and powerful Baptist preacher confronting his son\u2019s homosexuality.There was just one problem: Mr. Kiberd, best known for his work on such daytime soap operas as \u201cAll My Children\u201d and \u201cAnother World,\u201d hadn\u2019t acted prominently in about a decade, having been sidelined by a series of back, knee and hip problems. In fact, when he learned about \u201cCrusade,\u201d he was in a hospital bed, recovering from hip-replacement surgery.\u201cMy first reaction was, \u2018I can\u2019t even walk,\u2019\u201d said the actor, who admits to being \u201ccomfortably past 50.\u201dThese days, a quite mobile Mr. Kiberd is on stage six days a week at off-Broadway\u2019s       Jerry Orbach       Theater in Manhattan, where \u201cCrusade\u201d opened in late June.Friends and family say the show has given him a new lease on his theatrical life.\u201cCrusade\u201d garnered seven awards at New York\u2019s Midtown International Theatre Festival, including best actor for Mr. Kiberd, when it premiered at the event last year for a brief run of three performances. And while early reviews have been mixed for the show\u2019s current incarnation, Mr. Moss, who also directs the production, still envisions a potential home for it on Broadway one day.At the very least, Mr. Kiberd\u2019s performance has gotten the attention of one theatrical heavyweight: The Tony and Emmy Award-winning actor       Bryan Cranston.Mr. Cranston also is a friend, having known Mr. Kiberd since their days working together on a soap opera three decades ago. But Mr. Cranston was so taken with Mr. Kiberd\u2019s work as the larger-than-life preacher that he signed on as an investor in the off-Broadway production, which has a budget of roughly $700,000.\u201cHe\u2019s dangerous when he acts, and there\u2019s an attraction to danger,\u201d said Mr. Cranston, summing up Mr. Kiberd\u2019s appeal.Mr. Kiberd says he would welcome any notice the show would bring him, but for now he is more concerned with seeing that the play\u2019s themes resonate.The drama focuses not just on Big Jim\u2019s relationship with his son, but also on his relationship with God and his congregation. Connor Stephens is a parishioner who takes Big Jim\u2019s words to heart, resulting in an act of horrific violence that is at the center of the show.\u201cIt\u2019s like a prize fight for the soul of America, this play,\u201d Mr. Kiberd said.Write to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 17:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/veteran-actor-gets-new-lease-on-life-as-star-of-off-broadway-drama-1499721921", "news_title": "Veteran Actor Gets New Lease on Life as Star of Off-Broadway Drama ", "keywords": "actor,awards,drama,off-broadway,the crusade of connor stephens,James Kiberd,political,general news,celebrities,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,theater,television,radio"}, {"content": "The dollar was little changed Monday, as investors weighed the possibility of higher rates in the U.S. against signs of tightening monetary policy abroad.The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was recently unchanged at 88.36.Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen is scheduled to deliver her semiannual monetary policy report to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday.

Brent crude, the global benchmark, gained 17 cents, or 0.4%, to $46.88 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Both had been in losses until the traditional start of U.S. trading hours.Prices flipped to gains\u2014and stayed there about the rest of the day\u2014after data provider Genscape said stockpiles at Cushing, Okla., shrank by 2.1 million barrels from June 30 to July 7, according to a person who had reviewed the report. Cushing is the delivery point for the benchmark U.S. West Texas Intermediate oil contract and is often regarded as a key point for judging supply and demand trends.But the market is also likely simply rebounding from last week\u2019s sharp fall, said Ric Navy, senior vice president for energy futures at brokerage R.J.

It dropped 6% in just three sessions to end the week, a steep fall that might lead bearish traders to close out winning positions and take profits.\u201cNothing has structurally changed and as such today\u2019s gain in prices can only be categorized as light profit-taking buying,\u201d said       Dominick Chirichella,        an analyst at the Energy Management Institute, in a note Monday afternoon. \u201cThe market looks more likely to make a pass at testing the low for the year hit on June 21 rather than embarking on a sustained uptrend.\u201dOil prices went into a hard retreat last week in part tied to data showing another production growth spurt in the U.S. It had restarted the downward momentum that has derailed a widely-expected rally since early March, brokers said.Part of the selloff has come from U.S. Energy Information Administration data last week that showed U.S. production increased to nearly 9.34 million barrels a day, up from 9.25 million barrels a day the week prior. Production was up nearly 11% from a year ago and nearly back at its 10-month high. Friday\u2019s updated rig count from             Baker Hughes Inc.       also pointed to production increases. Oil producers added seven more rigs to their working fleet, rising to 763, more than double the 351 at work a year ago.\u201cWe might be getting some bullish sentiment in November, but that\u2019s several months of pain for bulls because we see these U.S. numbers and rig count numbers go up every week,\u201d said Hamza Khan, head of commodity strategy at ING Bank.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is considering putting a cap on how much oil members Nigeria and Libya can pump, cartel delegates said. Due to internal political unrest, The two countries have been exempt from OPEC\u2019s production-cut deal, which has been extended through to next March. The production limits could be voted on again when the organization meets on Nov. 30 in Vienna.But the oversupply threat is so severe, mere talk of supply caps there hasn\u2019t been enough to change momentum, Mr. Navy said. Libya\u2019s crude-oil output has surged to more than one million barrels a day, up from 400,000 in October, while Nigeria\u2019s output has risen to 1.6 million barrels a day, up from 200,000 barrels a day in October, according to JBC, a Vienna-based energy-industry consultancy.\u201cIt just gives you another selling opportunity.

The answer, according to the pros, is too often no.Overwhelmed by the swelling number of ETF choices, investors sometimes take shortcuts. They pick those just with the lowest fees or the strongest recent returns. Then, because ETFs are so easy to buy and sell\u2014unlike their mutual-fund cousins, they can be traded all day on exchanges, like stocks\u2014investors impatiently dump the laggards and move on to something else.For all of these reasons, the returns that investors earn in ETFs often can lag behind the performance of the ETFs themselves.As ETFs continue to attract more investor dollars, this may be a good time to step back and look at how to choose, trade and manage ETFs more safely:Aiming to gain an edge in a competitive field, financial firms create high-sounding labels for ETFs, such as \u201csmart beta,\u201d \u201cstrategic beta\u201d and \u201calternative beta.\u201d Such terms usually mean that an ETF weights the stocks in its basket based on something other than market cap or that it employs a proprietary strategy to try to trim risk or beat the broad market.Smart-beta funds can beat the market, at least for a while. But because their specialized strategies move in and out of vogue, stretches of good performance are frequently followed by lackluster returns, says       Phil Bak,        chief executive of Ann Arbor, Mich.-based ETF provider ACSI Funds and a former head of ETF listings at the New York Stock Exchange. What happens when a strategy becomes too popular is that the underlying stocks of the ETF become expensive, and the strategy then begins to underperform. Institutional players and professionals are continually rotating in and out of certain strategies, shifting to ones they believe are undervalued and due for a rebound.Dividend-focused ETFs, which did well in part of 2015 and last year, haven\u2019t fared as well lately for this reason, Mr. Bak says.People need to consider whether their investment-time horizons are long enough to justify owning an ETF whose performance could vary widely over several years.In theory, an ETF\u2019s net asset value should closely track the value of the stocks it holds. But the two can diverge more than usual at certain times of day\u2014such as early, before some stocks have opened at 9:30 a.m. ET, or near the 4 p.m. close, when a rush of late orders can cause heightened volatility.By not trading at the open or close, investors improve their chances of minimizing transaction costs paid on ETF trades, says       Joel Dickson,        Vanguard Group\u2019s global head of investment research and development. He and others also advise using limit trades\u2014specifying in advance the lowest price for a sale or highest price for a buy that you\u2019re willing to accept.Limit trades can be useful for a value play, such as trying to buy below where an ETF has been trading. But an alternative that offers price protection and better assurance of getting a trade done is a marketable limit order.In this approach, someone who wants to buy an ETF would set the limit price at or a few cents above the \u201cask,\u201d the lowest price a prospective seller will accept. When selling, the investor might set the limit price at or a few cents below the bid, which is the highest price a prospective buyer would be willing to pay.Because markets have been calm recently, investors may question the value of giving up some price certainty in exchange for better execution, says       Michael Iachini,        who heads manager research at Charles Schwab Investment Advisory Inc. But volatility will rise again, and marketable limit orders can protect investors against abrupt changes in price just as they are entering a trade, Mr. Iachini says.Sorting through numerous ETFs can be hard, but ETF shopping deserves as much time as analyzing actively managed mutual funds, says       David Lynch,        managing partner at Athena Capital in Lincoln, Mass.It may be tempting to skip fund literature and just choose the ETF with the lowest expense ratio, says       Todd Rosenbluth,        head of ETF and mutual-fund research at New York-based financial-analysis firm CFRA. That could be a mistake: Performance can hinge much more on what is in the underlying index than on a small difference in fees, he notes.Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets       ETF (VEA), with an expense ratio of 0.07%, and          iShares Core MSCI EAFE Index       (IEFA), at 0.08%, are similar funds. But the iShares fund, which has more French and German stocks and no exposure to Canada, has gained nearly 15% this year, compared with about 14% for the Vanguard ETF, Mr. Rosenbluth notes.People often create ETF portfolios by first buying a broad fund such as          SPDR S&P 500       ETF (SPY) and then surrounding it with more-specialized ETFs, or \u201csatellite positions.\u201d But commonly, returns on the satellite positions lag behind the return from the S&P, says       Jay Batcha,        a Traverse City, Mich.-based adviser whose firm, Optimal Capital, guides other advisers on ETF strategies.Avoid picking those ETFs that have sizzled the most lately, says Mr. Batcha. It\u2019s also important to understand that the narrower an ETF\u2019s strategy, the more volatile it can be, Mr. Batcha adds.This year, investors poured into          Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund       (XLF), believing that banks generally would benefit from deregulation and rising interest rates. At one point in June, it was up only marginally for the year while the S&P was up 8%. Then it surged to catch up to the S&P. How volatile has it been? It has a beta of 1.5 over the past year, which means it has been 50% more volatile than the S&P 500. For the past three years, the fund was only 12% more volatile than the S&P. The heightened volatility may reflect shifting investor expectations about what the Trump administration will do in terms of financial deregulation.ETF fact sheets usually describe the factors behind the strategy. Smart-beta funds often use three to six metrics. Some others\u2014such as low-volatility ETFs\u2014tend to rely a lot on one factor. Some may use 15 or 20 factors as part of a complex, quantitative approach.Mr. Batcha says having more factors tends to smooth performance over a market cycle. Among ETFs he likes is          Reality Shares Divcon Leaders Dividend       ETF (LEAD), which uses seven factors to spot companies most likely to raise dividends, according to its fact sheet.But steer away from ETFs whose strategies aren\u2019t well-described in literature, says Mr. Bak of ACSI Funds.\u201cIf, after a half-hour, you are still scratching your head and trying to figure out when an ETF might or might not do well,\u201d he says, \u201cperhaps that investment is too complicated for you.\u201dMr. Pollock is a writer in Ridgewood, N.J.

They say program trading is distorting the market, often causing shallow price drops to accelerate.Take May 25. Even after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to continue cutting back supply, oil fell almost 5%.While some observers attributed the move to investor expectations for even deeper cuts from OPEC, others said the drop steepened as algorithms hopped on the trend. To oil investors geared to fundamentals, it was an example of how the use of algorithms based on technical trading signs has been influencing commodities like never before.Saudi Arabia energy minister       Khalid al-Falih       was among those who pointed to technical trading for causing the May 25 selloff to intensify. \u201cFor many people, it was time to sell,\u201d he said in an interview after the May 25 OPEC meeting. \u201cOnce you broke some of the technical barriers,\u201d that also had an impact, he said.Although automated trading has swept stock and bond markets for years, it has only recently accounted for the majority of trades in energy.Automated trading in energy-related contracts accounted for 58% of volume from late 2014 to late 2016, compared with 47% in the preceding two-year period, a March study by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows.Weekly data releases on U.S. crude storage are still a significant factor in market movement, but price swings have been magnified by programmed trading, analysts say.On March 8 and 9, analysts say algorithms kicked in after data showed record-high inventory levels. Oil slid that day below $50 a barrel for the first time this year.\u201cAn increasing number of market participants are being swayed more by the headlines than by counting physical barrels,\u201d said       Michael Tran,        director of energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cA lot of this has been driven by algos and quants.\u201dStrategies vary greatly among funds, making the impact of algorithms and automation difficult to quantify. The complexity of algorithms also make them an easy target for blame, said       Michael Pomada,        chief executive of Crabel Capital Management, a hedge fund with $2.2 billion in assets and $700 million in trend-following strategies.\u201cIt\u2019s like the boogeyman,\u201d said Mr. Pomada. \u201cPeople tend to blame things that they don\u2019t know much about.\u201dAlgorithms often have intricate and opaque methodology. They tend to follow set rules on when to buy and sell, using signals such as moving averages and volatility to identify trends.But traders may combine mathematical models and human discretion to place bets on price moves ranging from within one day to several months.Although both human traders and algorithms use automation to execute orders, the rising level of automated trades is one benchmark that reflects the growing influence and speed of computers in oil trading.Computerized trading is also taking over other commodities. According to the CFTC report, the share of automated trading in agriculture rose to 49% for a two-year period ending in late 2016, from 38% in the preceding two years, and to 54% from 47% in metals for the same periods.But crude has been particularly vulnerable to big swings this year as traders try to gauge the impact of OPEC cuts amid a global oil gut. Meanwhile, momentum traders who use algorithms have grasped for market trends, said       Peter Hahn,        of Bridgeton Research Group, a quantitative research firm.Oil is \u201cin a transitioning period,\u201d Mr. Hahn said. In that kind of market, he said, \u201cmomentum-based algorithms are more likely to be whipped into and out of long and short positions.\u201dMoney is also pouring into some algorithmic strategies. In 2016, investors pumped $25.5 billion of new money into commodity trading advisors, or CTAs\u2014many of which use algorithms to follow trends in the futures market\u2014according to data provider Preqin. CTAs attracted another $7.2 billion of new investor cash in the first quarter of this year, bringing the funds\u2019 total assets to $256 billion.Funds that use trend-following strategies say it is unlikely their models have been disrupting the market. Traditional funds that don\u2019t specialize in systematic trading or commodities can also be trend followers.\u201cThere can be a lot of momentum players out there of all different types,\u201c said Christopher Reeve, director of product management at Aspect Capital, a CTA that uses trend-following strategies and manages more than $6 billion. \u201cWe would see very quickly if we were having too high of a market impact.\u201dGoldman Sachs                   said CTAs can create trading opportunities. \u201cFundamental traders shouldn\u2019t be afraid of the CTAs, but rather view them as creating opportunities when they push markets away from fundamentals,\u201d the firm wrote in a commodities research report from June 29.Even traders that take positions based on fundamental signs are building models to predict how trend followers can move oil, said       Anthony Caruso,        head of quantitative and macro strategies at Mesirow Advanced Strategies, a fund of hedge funds.\u201cThey know that trend followers are kind of the elephant in the room,\u201d he said.Write to Stephanie Yang at stephanie.yang@wsj.com and Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications  The trading data in the graphic refers to the share of futures trading that is automated.

SE,        KLKNF -0.75%       a metals trading and processing firm, supports the       Trump       administration\u2019s plans for additional tariffs on Chinese-made steel, said Chief Executive       Gisbert R\u00fchl.\u201cI think import tariffs are the way for the U.S. and the European Union to counter Chinese dumping-prices,\u201d he said.The Trump administration in April opened a wide-ranging probe into whether to place additional tariffs on steel imports in the name of national security. It missed a self-imposed deadline for concluding the probe at the end of June but is expected to announce a decision soon.China, the world\u2019s biggest steel producer, has pledged to cut overcapacities. The country cut more than 65 million tons of steel production capacity in 2016.Mr. R\u00fchl sees these as encouraging steps, but cautions: \u201cStill, this is a process that will take years. There is no quick fix for this.\u201dKl\u00f6ckner generates roughly 40% of its annual revenue in the U.S., and expects both sales and revenue will increase by 3% to 4% this year. Global annual revenue in 2016 was \u20ac5.7 billion ($6.5 billion).The company last year traded more than 2.3 million tons of steel in the U.S., Mr. R\u00fchl said. Most of the steel traded by Kl\u00f6ckner in the U.S. is sourced locally and therefore not affected by existing tariffs exceeding 200% for some types of steel, Mr. R\u00fchl said in an interview with CFO Journal. \u201cAs steel prices stabilize on a higher level, we will benefit.\u201dU.S. steel prices have rallied in recent months. The September-delivery futures contract for the benchmark U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel Index most recently traded at $620 per short ton on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This is nearly double the lows of $364 per short ton, set in late 2015.Should the administration launch the infrastructure investment plan President Donald Trump floated during his campaign, it could provide an additional sales and a revenue boost for Kl\u00f6ckner, which has 50 branches in the U.S.For some of Kl\u00f6ckner\u2019s U.S. customers\u2014among them construction firms and machinery-and-tool makers\u2014there also could be negative consequences following the introduction of new tariffs, as Kl\u00f6ckner passes on higher purchase prices.\u201cNot all of our customers will be able to do the same and pass on higher prices, which is why there needs to be sound judgment around potential new tariffs\u201d, Mr. R\u00fchl said.But, should steel prices creep up after the introduction of a new batch of tariffs, producers could decide to reactivate dormant capacities, which in the long run would depress prices, he said.Kl\u00f6ckner also supports an increase in European anti-dumping tariffs levied on imported steel. \u201cCompared with the U.S., European steel tariffs are much too low,\u201d Mr. R\u00fchl. That could lead to Chinese steel producers targeting the European market instead of selling into the U.S. or elsewhere.\u201cIf the new tariffs introduced by the U.S. are significant, I could see the EU resorting to higher duties or tariff quotas,\u201d said       Edwin Vermulst,        a partner at Brussels-based law firm VVGB Advocaten.

He is serving his sentence at a federal prison in Pennsylvania.Mr. Boyland\u2019s lawyer had argued his conviction should be reversed because of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the case of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, whose conviction was vacated last year.In that case, the court narrowed the federal definition of bribery, saying ordinary constituent services, such as setting up meetings or phone calls, didn\u2019t count as taking official government action.In their ruling\u00a0Monday, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said while some of the instructions given to the jury didn\u2019t meet the standards set by the McDonnell case, the evidence for Mr. Boyland\u2019s conviction was so strong that \u201cwe see no reasonable possibility, in light of the record as a whole, that that flaw affected the outcome of the case.\u201dJames Branden,        an attorney for Mr. Boyland, said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand the circuit\u2019s conclusion that erroneous charges on key elements pertaining to a full two thirds of the counts in the indictment did not somehow affect Mr. Boyland\u2019s substantial rights.\u201dA spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment.Prosecutors said that, from 2007 to 2011, Mr. Boyland engaged in several schemes that included accepting bribes in exchange for helping a carnival promoter get government approvals and stealing state funds intended to benefit the elderly. During these schemes, he also lied to undercover Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, according to prosecutors.Former state Assembly Speaker       Sheldon Silver       and former Senate Majority leader Dean Skelos also have appealed their public-corruption convictions. Lawyers for both Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, and       Mr. Skelos,        a Nassau County Republican, have argued their clients\u2019 convictions are no longer valid because of the McDonnell decision.The ruling in Mr. Boyland\u2019s case doesn\u2019t offer much guidance to the outcomes of the appeals of Messrs. Silver and Skelos, said       Jennifer Rodgers,        executive director of Columbia Law School\u2019s Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity. These cases have a different legal standard because, unlike in Mr. Boyland\u2019s case, their lawyers objected to the jury instructions during the trial, she said.The evidence in Mr. Boyland\u2019s also case shows his official actions went significantly beyond those of Mr. McDonnell, which included setting up meetings, she added.", "news_time": "2017-07-10 16:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-appeals-court-upholds-former-n-y-lawmakers-conviction-1499716934", "news_title": "Federal Appeals Court Upholds Former N.Y.

It took United\u2019s Jose Mourinho to find the solution: pawn him off to his boyhood club.For Rooney, the wunderkind who grew up to be the top scorer in England national team history, the return to Everton is the perfect conclusion to a career that is grinding to a halt. He ignored the big-money lure of China and the U.S. to go back to his roots on Merseyside.For Manchester United, it was about time. Rooney may have scored 253 goals for the club, but he was severely diminished. His last 20-goal season in all competitions was five years ago. The last time he had 10 Premier League assists was 2013/14. He was a forward, then a playmaker, then a central midfielder, then maybe he was a forward again? Even Mourinho, one of the greatest minds in soccer, failed to figure out how to use Rooney effectively at the end. So he chose to phase out his captain.\u201cIt is never easy to see a great player playing less football than he would like and I could not stand in his way when he asked to go back to Everton,\u201d Mourinho said.Rooney is only 31, hardly ancient for a player born with his talent. Just consider that the man who spent last season as United\u2019s central striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, excelled in that role at 35. But with Rooney, as with a used car, it isn\u2019t the years, it\u2019s the miles.Rooney has been a Premier League mainstay since he was a teenager. He scored his first Premier League goal five days shy of his 17th birthday in 2002, years before anyone had heard of Ronaldo or Messi. He scored a hat-trick in his very first game for United in 2004 at age 19.His tally for Everton and United is a monumental 636 games across all competitions.Add that to the fact that Rooney was never the best about taking care of his fitness\u2014he often struggled with his weight\u2014and the toll of a 15-year pro career is even greater. How long it will continue is unclear. In a summer of shrewd spending from Everton, adding a player of Rooney\u2019s age and declining form feels like a rare concession to sentiment.\u201cHis experience to win titles is something really important for Everton and that was another reason why we tried to bring him back,\u201d manager Ronald Koeman said.The move looked even more astute from United\u2019s perspective a day later when the club officially announced that its newest striker would be the 24-year-old Belgian Romelu Lukaku, who went in the opposite direction, from Everton to Manchester. With his youth, power, and clear understanding of where he is supposed to be on the field\u2014plus the legs to get there\u2014he is everything that Rooney isn\u2019t.Lukaku scored 25 league goals last season, second only to Tottenham\u2019s Harry Kane, for an Everton side that finished seventh in the standings.\u201cWhen Manchester United and Jose Mourinho come knocking at the door,\u201d Lukaku said, \u201cit\u2019s an opportunity of a lifetime and one that I could not turn down.\u201dWrite to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 15:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-manchester-united-solved-its-rooney-problem-1499716041", "news_title": "How Manchester United Solved Its Rooney Problem ", "keywords": "everton,manchester united,soccer ,wayne rooney,soccer,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014A British judge who previously ruled that an 11-month-old should have his life support withdrawn and barred his family from taking him to the U.S. said Monday he would examine suggestions of new evidence relating to a potential treatment for the boy.Charlie Gard\u2019s       case has generated international attention, including interventions by President       Donald Trump,        who offered unspecified help to the British boy\u2019s family on Twitter last week.At an emotionally charged hearing, Justice Nicholas Francis said he would rule \u201cnot on the basis of tweets but on the basis of clear evidence\u201d that pointed to the possibility of an improvement in Charlie\u2019s condition. He said he would hear additional evidence on Thursday.\u201cI am having to balance the likely or possible damage to Charlie by his continuing to be treated as he has been and to uncover evidence as much as we can,\u201d the judge said. He said he would only change his mind if he was convinced that there was genuinely new evidence to support keeping Charlie alive.The boy suffers from a rare genetic disease that affects his brain, breathing and muscles and is on an artificial ventilator at Great Ormond Street Hospital.Doctors there say his disorder can\u2019t be effectively treated and that keeping him on a ventilator could be causing him pain, but an expert at a U.S. hospital has offered a treatment he says has helped in cases similar to but not the same as Charlie\u2019s. In addition, the pope has said the Vatican\u2019s children\u2019s hospital would treat him for free.Last week, Great Ormond Street called for a new hearing after the hospitals and their researchers reported \u201cfresh evidence about their proposed experimental treatment.\u201d Katie Gollop, an attorney for Great Ormond Street, said doctors and nurses treating Charlie were under immense pressure, and that attorneys for the child\u2019s parents had threatened the hospital with legal action if it didn\u2019t apply to the court for a fresh hearing.Ms. Gollop said the U.S. doctor offering to treat Charlie had talked in recent days with Great Ormond Street\u2019s experts on the condition at the White House\u2019s request.She later told the court that \u201cthe hospital went to enormous efforts\u201d to find another facility that was prepared to treat Charlie. In response, Charlie\u2019s father,       Chris Gard,        shouted \u201cwhen are you going to start telling the truth?\u201dConnie Yates,        Charlie\u2019s mother, appealed to the judge, saying that any parent would accept even a small chance at success if they thought it would help their child.In April, the judge ruled that maintaining Charlie\u2019s life support and sending him for a therapy in the U.S. that hasn\u2019t been tested on mice or humans with the same rare genetic disorder wasn\u2019t in the child\u2019s best interests. His decision was upheld by the Supreme Court in June and the European Court of Human Rights declined to intervene on that ruling when Charlie\u2019s parents asked it to do so last month.A spokesman for the family said outside court that \u201cbaby Charlie and his parents are thankful for the outcome\u201d of Monday\u2019s hearing.Write to Joanna Sugden at joanna.sugden@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Sick Child\u2019s Parents to Get New Hearing.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 15:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/british-judge-to-assess-new-evidence-in-case-of-baby-on-life-support-1499707320", "news_title": "British Judge to Assess New Evidence in Case of Baby on Life Support", "keywords": "charlie gard, health, life support, terminally ill,u.k., united kingdom, withdraw,Charlie Gard,political,general news,crime,legal action,demographic health,health,infant,child,teenage health,medical treatments,procedures"}, {"content": "Global government bonds strengthened Monday, showing some signs of stabilization after a two-week selloff.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.371%, compared with Friday\u2019s 2.393%, the highest level since May 11. Yields fall as bond prices rise.Government bond yields in Germany, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain and many other European countries also pulled back.Traders say the recent price declines make the bond market appealing to investors.

The tone in the market, he said, has changed \u201csince we have heard from global central bankers during the past couple of weeks that very easy policy will have to come to an end eventually.\u201dThe 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield jumped by 0.247 percentage point in the previous two weeks following months of slides. One key factor driving sales of Treasury debt has been investors\u2019 worries that major central banks may dial back monetary-stimulus support given signs of broad improvement in the global economy.Investors are particularly nervous over the European Central Bank, whose bond-buying program has played a big role in sending global yields to historically low levels. Analysts have warned that the value of government bonds may fall when these large and steady buyers dial back support.Some investors say they don\u2019t expect a big rise in yields unless inflation pressures flare up.Reports of consumer price moves in the U.S. have pointed to slowing inflation over the past few months. Friday\u2019s nonfarm employment release showed tepid wage inflation growth even as the economy added more than 200,000 jobs last month, which continues to confound investors, analysts and Fed officials.The U.S. consumer prices report for June\u2014a key data point this week to influence investors\u2019 bets on bond yields\u2014is scheduled for release Friday.Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       is scheduled to hold her semiannual testimony before Congress on Wednesday. Ms. Yellen has shrugged off recent softening inflation readings as temporary. The Fed\u2019s minutes for its June meeting suggested the central bank may start in the coming months to pare back its large bondholdings that include more than $2 trillion worth of Treasury debt.This balance sheet reduction factor is likely to push up long-term Treasury yields, and the 10-year yield may rise to 2.75% or higher at the end of this year, said some analysts and money managers.Others are skeptical that this would happen without signs of stronger growth and higher inflation, which would be a big factor deciding the pace of the Fed\u2019s tightening monetary policy.Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said he is \u201canxious something more sustainable may be afoot\u201d regarding softer inflation, citing factors that include the easing of owners\u2019 equivalent rent, falling auto prices, and slipping apparel costs.New debt sales will be another focus this week for bond investors. A $24 billion sale of three-year notes is scheduled on Tuesday, followed by a $20 billion sale of 10-year notes Wednesday and a $12 billion sale of 30-year bonds on Thursday.Some traders say the auctions may attract investors who see bonds as a bargain after their recent selloff.Any sign of lukewarm appetite for the auctions could raise anxiety toward the bond market and cause yields to rise, they say.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 15:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-government-bonds-stabilize-after-selloff-1499697153", "news_title": "Global Government Bonds Stabilize After Selloff", "keywords": "bond market,bond yields,interest rates,treasurys,treasury yields,u.s. bonds,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,routine market,financial news,treasury bond prices,commentary,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Rising bond yields threaten to undermine the case for holding expensive stocks, and shareholders should be worried.It has been \u201cTINA\u201d for the last seven years. That means \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d but to buy stocks with bond yields so low. But the danger is that shareholders now will return to their jilted first loves of cash and bonds as yields rise.Stock markets have provided a flavor of the risks ahead as bond yields jumped over the past two weeks. In the eurozone, where the bond moves started, financials are the only sector that have managed to rise, as banks benefit from higher yields. In the U.S., yields haven\u2019t risen quite so rapidly, but financials, up 4.2%, are way ahead. The only other sectors in the black\u2014industrials and materials\u2014moved just positive after\u00a0Friday\u2019s solid jobs report.Two weeks is a short period to assess anything, but the pattern fits the menace of a breakup with TINA. If investors bought stocks because bond yields were so miserable, they are likely to sell stocks when bond yields perk up and the logic of the hunt for yield goes into reverse.Just how big the danger is will depend on what happens to bond yields, of course. But it will also depend on why yields rise, and the latest reason is concerning.Rising bond yields can be good for stocks if they are driven up by expectations of a stronger economy. Higher future profits can more than offset the cost of discounting those profits back to today at a higher rate, making stocks more valuable (higher yields make profits far in the future less valuable than profits made quickly\u2014so it makes sense that speculative technology stocks have fallen sharply).Bond yields pushed up by anything other than a strong economy are bad news, and the latest rise looks as though it was mostly driven by concern about central-bank bond-buying, not the economy.Bond investors like to break down bond yields into two parts: the expectation of interest rates over the life of the bond and a bit extra, driven by supply and demand, to cover the risk of being locked in until maturity. The extra bit is known as the term premium, and accounted for almost the entirety of the Treasury yield rise in the past two weeks, according to calculations by the New York Federal Reserve. The same goes for the eurozone, according to Goldman Sachs estimates.Combine the term premium with a measure of how expensive bonds are compared with stocks, and we can get a feel for just how bad things could get for shareholders as bond yields rise.Even after the recent rise, the term premium as calculated by the New York Fed is extremely low. If it merely returned to its 50-year average, while expectations for the economy and Fed hikes remained unchanged, the 10-year Treasury would yield 4.2%, a massive rise from\u00a0Monday\u2019s\u00a02.4%.It is hard to believe a move of that size will happen quickly, but it illustrates just how much the TINA argument for equities depends on the term premium, and so on central bank bond buying.If the term premium did rise back to its long-run average, it would be enough to wipe out half the valuation gap between stocks and bonds on the popular\u2014though flawed\u2014measure of the forward equity risk premium, the main TINA justification. The equity risk premium values stocks, like bonds, by looking at the expected earnings yield, the inverse of the price/earnings ratio, to see how much higher it is than the bond yield.With a forward earnings yield of 5.62% and a 10-year Treasury yielding 2.37%, the gap of 3.23 percentage points is the projected annual extra reward for holding the S&P 500.Theoretically this widely used measure makes little sense, since earnings are variable and should rise with inflation, while bond coupons are fixed and static. There is no reason for the gap between them to be at any particular level, and the fact the two moved closely together throughout the 1990s doesn\u2019t mean they will again.In practice, this measure should be very concerning for the very people most likely to rely on it, those obsessed by TINA. Far from screaming buy, the equity risk premium at 3.23 points is about the lowest since Lehman Brothers failed, and is back down to where it was in November 2007. Those who think it is a useful guide need to admit that shares are more expensive relative to bonds than they have been in a decade.Combine a rising term premium with the already narrowing gap between shares and bonds, and the siren song of TINA loses its melody.Investors who expect the economy to strengthen might reasonably hope that profits rise enough to offset higher yields, even at today\u2019s elevated stock valuations. Those who have fallen for TINA\u2019s charms should consider the homely values of cash and bonds again.Write to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'The Stock Market Faces A New Threat: Bonds.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 15:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-beware-bond-prices-are-threatening-the-stock-market-1499714256", "news_title": "Investors Beware: Bond Prices Are Threatening the Stock Market", "keywords": "Goldman Sachs Group,GS,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014U.S. consumer borrowing rose in May, according to new data from the Federal Reserve.Outstanding consumer credit, a measure of non-real estate debt, rose by $18.41 billion in May from the prior month, climbing at a 5.78% seasonally adjusted annual rate, the Fed said Monday.

Bloomingdale\u2019s gave members of its loyalty program a $25 reward card for every $100 beauty purchase. The moves followed a decision by             Macy\u2019s Inc.        M 1.37%       to offer 15% off cosmetics, which it touted in nationally televised advertisements this spring.Some executives warned that discounting is a short-term fix, and that cosmetic deals will lead to the same problems these chains have to face with respect to apparel, where ever greater discounts are needed to keep shoppers coming back.\u201cDepartment stores shoot themselves in the foot when they do this,\u201d said       Michael Gould,        a former chief executive of Bloomingdale\u2019s, who ran the upscale department-store chain for 23 years until his retirement in 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re putting themselves on drugs.\u201dA decade ago, shoppers would have been hard-pressed to find any Est\u00e9e Lauder lipsticks, Bobbi Brown mascara or             Shiseido                   blush on sale. These \u201cprestige\u201d brands are sold mainly at department and specialty stores and tend to be pricier than the so-called mass cosmetics sold at drugstores.Department stores have long given prestige cosmetics prime space on the ground floors of their stores, and the brands confined their distribution to these emporiums.But the retail landscape has shifted. Shoppers are increasingly skipping the mall to buy online. Specialty chains such as Sephora and             Ulta Beauty Inc.       are siphoning away customers. Brands such as Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clarins and Dior now sell to such chains as well as through their own websites.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen our competitors start to discount items like cosmetics, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re saying we\u2019re doing it,\u201d said       Jerry Storch,        the CEO of Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor parent             Hudson\u2019s Bay Co.      , on a conference call last month. \u201cOnce you get into that kind of a situation, everyone is fighting for every inch.\u201dSales of prestige makeup in the U.S. are growing, totaling $8 billion in the 12 months to May, an 11% increase over the same period a year earlier, according to market-research firm NPD Group Inc.But department stores\u2019 share of the market fell to 19% in North America last year from 23% a decade ago, according to Euromonitor International data analyzed by Bernstein Research. Over the same period, specialty beauty retailers increased their share to 20% from 14%.Katie Fitzgerald       usually buys her cosmetics at Sephora, but was recently at a Macy\u2019s near her home in Haymarket, Va., when she happened upon a departmentwide sale. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, look, cheap makeup,\u2019 \u201d the 17-year-old said. She bought a Smashbox contour palette. \u201cI figured I might as well since I was there anyway.\u201dEst\u00e9e Lauder Cos., L\u2019Or\u00e9al SA and other large cosmetics makers declined to comment on the recent pricing moves. A Macy\u2019s spokeswoman said the retailer is using discounts but also looking at other ways to bolster beauty sales, including a loyalty program it will introduce this fall and by reconfiguring its departments to make them easier to shop.Sephora\u2014a unit of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE\u2014and Ulta have done a better job of appealing to younger shoppers with open-sell formats that allow customers to try products without the help of sales associates and to mix and match different brands, analysts say.The shift has upended the pricing dynamics because stores such as Sephora and Ulta tend to display prestige brands alongside more mass labels. \u201cThe pricing halo around prestige gets eroded because it gets muddled with the rest of the category,\u201d said UBS analyst       Stephen Powers.Sephora and Ulta offer discounts, too, but they are less frequent and tend to be restricted to their loyalty programs, according to spokeswomen for both chains. Sephora, for instance, holds two sales a year for its \u201cBeauty Insiders\u201d members.Apparel makers bear the brunt of any discounts by agreeing to guarantee department-store margins. Beauty brands have no such pacts, meaning that any price cuts come out of the retailers\u2019 pockets.Macy\u2019s\u2014which also owns Bloomingdale\u2019s\u2014blamed a decline in first-quarter gross margins partly on increased promotional activity in its beauty business. To combat the problem, Macy\u2019s is borrowing a page from Sephora. It now has open-sell areas in its cosmetics departments in roughly half of its 670 stores.\u201cIt\u2019s a disease that retailers have to discount more to make the sales numbers,\u201d said       Barbara Zinn Moore,        who was Lord & Taylor\u2019s vice president of cosmetics and fragrance from 2001 until last month. \u201cBut how else do you get the sales growth?\u201dWrite to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com and Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Stores Mark Down Prices for Makeup.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 15:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-cosmetics-counter-was-long-immune-to-discounting-not-anymore-1499679001", "news_title": "The Cosmetics Counter Was Long Immune to Discounting.

He made $9.2 million there since January 2016, according to his financial disclosure form.Mr. Wray lists a total of 20 clients who paid him more than $5,000 each since January 2015, including Johnson & Johnson, Wells Fargo & Co.,             Chevron,       Fan Duel Inc. and Draft Kings Inc., Alcatel-Lucent SA,             Credit Suisse Group AG       and New Jersey Gov.       Chris Christie.The nominee has been running a \u201cspecial matters\u201d group at King & Spalding, representing companies and individuals in government investigations.His extensive client list could hinder his oversight of some FBI investigations. An ethics letter signed by Justice Department official Lee Lofthus said that if confirmed, Mr. Wray would be barred from participating in any matter involving \u201cspecific parties in which he knows that a former client of his is a party or represents a party\u201d for one year from the date of his last work for them.He also would be barred from participating \u201cpersonally and substantially\u201d in any matter that involves a party represented by King & Spalding, unless he is authorized to do so, the letter said.Mr. Wray listed four \u201cconfidential clients\u201d on his form, describing them only as \u201cU.S. organizations.\u201d He said he could not name three because they are \u201csubject to non-public investigations.\u201d In declining to disclose the fourth, Mr. Wray cited Washington, D.C., bar association rules that protect client confidences.The disclosures also list around 20 pages of assets, including hundreds of stockholdings through a family investment partnership. Financial disclosure forms don\u2019t require the exact value of the assets, asking only for a range. Based on the information provided, Mr. Wray is worth between $23 million and $42 million, according to a Wall Street Journal calculation.That is more than many other top Justice Department officials.       Eric Holder,        who ran a similar white-collar defense practice before becoming attorney general in 2009, was worth around $8 million in 2009, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Overall, Mr. Trump has assembled one of the wealthiest administration teams in recent memory, appointing several billionaires and millionaires to top posts.Mr. Wray is scheduled to face lawmakers on Wednesday in what is likely to be a contentious confirmation hearing, less because of his personal qualifications than because of the storms surrounding the FBI and Democrats\u2019 desire to press him on his independence from potential presidential pressure.Mr. Wray was nominated after Mr. Trump fired the last director,       James Comey,        amid an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential connections between Russia and the Trump campaign.Write to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 14:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-nominee-christopher-wray-earned-9-2-million-at-law-firm-since-january-2016-1499712979", "news_title": "FBI Nominee Christopher Wray Earned $9.2 Million at Law Firm Since January 2016", "keywords": "christopher wray, christopher wray clients, christopher wray disclosure form, christopher wray ethics form, christopher wray hearing, christopher wray stock ownership, donald trump, fbi, federal bureau of investigation, james comey, king & spalding, lee loftus,FBI,King & Spalding,Alcatel-Lucent,ALU,Johnson & Johnson,JNJ,Wells Fargo &,WFC,Donald Trump,political,general news,national,public security,law enforcement,political appointments,terminations,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,retail,wholesale,specialty stores,legal services,business,consumer services,technology"}, {"content": "Today\u2019s smartphones are essentially a collection of processors and memory wedded tightly to a high-definition touch screen. Large smartphone manufacturers like Apple and             Samsung                   design some chips themselves, but procure many others from a wide range of suppliers with different areas of expertise. Three of the largest chip makers by market cap\u2014            Intel,Broadcom                   and             Qualcomm                  \u2014have major business with smartphones.But smartphones aren\u2019t the growth market they once were. Global smartphone unit sales rose barely 2% last year compared with 10% the year before, according to IDC. High-profile new designs this year from Apple and Samsung are expected to give a lift to upgrades. But unit sales are still expected to rise only 4% for the year, IDC predicts.The best play for investors is to find companies not limited to selling one chip per phone. Memory companies like Micron and             Western Digital                   benefit from higher amounts of DRAM and NAND flash being built into new phones. Micron CEO       Sanjay Mehrotra       noted in the company\u2019s last earnings call that DRAM in even low and midtier phones would double by next year.Another opportunity comes from the so-called radio frequency, or RF, chips that amplify signals, filter interference and boost data speeds. Smartphone makers are packing more of these types of chips per device to make their products work across multiple networks around the world. That is good news for Broadcom, Skyworks and             Qorvo.       Ed Snyder of Charter Equity estimates total RF chip content in this year\u2019s new iPhone models alone will average about $27 per unit\u2014up 30% in just two years.The trick here is timing. Most stocks in this group have already seen a strong run; Micron, Broadcom and Skyworks are all up more than 30% so far this year, thanks in part to their other strong businesses, including supplying the newly launched Galaxy S8. And Apple is widely expected to delay the shipment of its redesigned, 10th-anniversary iPhone this fall due to possible component shortages. In a research note Monday, Andy Hargreaves of KeyBanc Capital Markets said expectations for an iPhone launch delay have already been incorporated into Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimates for several Apple suppliers\u2014including Broadcom, Skyworks and             Cirrus Logic.That will likely curb projections in the coming earnings season. And it won\u2019t be clear until the iPhones actually ship which chips are actually inside. But Broadcom and Skyworks both trade at less than 15 times forward earnings\u2014in line with the sector average.

Minutes before he arrived ahead of the announcement, plumes of smoke from apparent airstrikes were visible over the horizon from the direction of the final Islamic State-occupied pocket of the Old City on the western bank of the Tigris River.\u201cI announce the end and collapse of Daesh, here in Mosul, the same city where it started,\u201d Mr. Abadi said, using an Arabic acronym for the group.VIEW InteractiveHe was dressed in black fatigues and ringed by Humvees filled with troops from the army, counterterrorism units and federal police that had participated in the battle.The pronouncement formally ended a battle that spanned nearly nine months, displacing hundreds of thousands of people and killing several thousand Islamic State militants and Iraqi troops and civilians, according to government authorities and the United Nations.Cheers erupted from the assembled troops after the announcement. Federal police units danced and sang songs in the street, holding their guns high in the air but not firing them. Authorities warned Iraqis to refrain from firing celebratory gunshots, which can be deadly when they fall back to the earth.The army said it dropped some three million Iraqi flags decorated with maps of Mosul on the city.While declaring victory, Mr. Abadi said Iraq\u2019s efforts against Islamic State were far from over, underlining the gravity of the economic and security challenges the city and the country as a whole will face long after the fighting stops.\u201cWe have another mission ahead of us, which is the mission of stability, building and cleansing Daesh sleeper cells,\u201d he said, adding that the same level of effort was necessary to complete these tasks as to defeat Islamic State.Mosul had been Islamic State\u2019s largest population center and its last major foothold in Iraq. But forces have yet to evict Islamic State from Hawija, a town south of Mosul, and Tal Afar, a city west of Mosul.Still, the city\u2019s loss leaves Islamic State scattered and facing a mounting threat in its remaining strongholds. A U.S.-backed assault on Raqqa, its de facto capital in Syria, is under way.The U.S.-led coalition congratulated Mr. Abadi and his forces on the victory, while noting that the broader fight against Islamic State continued.\u201cMake no mistake; this victory alone does not eliminate [Islamic State] and there is still a tough fight ahead,\u201d said Lt. Gen.       Stephen Townsend,        the U.S. general who commands the coalition. \u201cBut the loss of one of its twin capitals and a jewel of their so-called caliphate is a decisive blow.\u201dMr. Abadi arrived in Mosul on Sunday, hailing Iraqis for their \u201cvictory\u201d against the extremist group, despite ongoing fighting against pockets of Islamic State resistance in the historic Old City.Backed by airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition, the Iraqi army and counterterrorism troops battled through fierce Islamic State resistance in the densely populated area on Monday, officially putting an end to nearly three years of the Sunni Muslim terror group\u2019s rule over Iraq\u2019s second-largest city.\u201cWe commend the Iraqi Security Forces for their bravery and sacrifice and reaffirm our commitment to supporting our Iraqi partners in their efforts to drive ISIS out of every inch of Iraqi territory,\u201d a State Department official said earlier Monday, using an acronym for Islamic State.The extremist group initially took Mosul in June 2014, part of a sweep across northern Iraq that brought about one-third of the country under its control.

The Art Ensemble offered a uniquely broad range of styles\u2014\u201dgreat black music from the ancient to the future\u201d was their motto\u2014and a rare theatricality; three of the five members dressed in flamboyant robes and painted their faces, and a fourth wore a physician\u2019s lab coat. Mr. Mitchell, on the other hand, appeared in street clothes with a focused, taciturn look that suggested he was about to give a lecture. Yet he played with both precise control and powerful abandon; his compositions and improvising are a cornerstone of the group\u2019s legacy. Apart from the Art Ensemble, he released \u201cSound\u201d (Delmark, 1966), \u201cNonaah\u201d (Nessa, 1977) and \u201c      Snurdy McGurdy       and Her Dancin\u2019 Shoes\u201d (Nessa, 1981), each a landmark in the Chicago school of jazz\u2019s       avant       garde, which favored an austere meditative sound, a stark contrast to the intense and often dissonant approach found in New York and Europe.Mr. Mitchell just released a new recording, \u201cBells for the South Side\u201d (ECM), a two-disc collection that documents a September 2015 concert held during the 50th anniversary celebrations in Chicago for the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, a collective that supports and presents nonmainstream musicians. The concert amounts to a retrospective of Mr. Mitchell\u2019s work; it features several associates who have worked with him since the \u201980s.The recording opens with a sparse but demanding piece, \u201cSpatial Aspects of the Sound,\u201d that is heavier on space than notes, but things pick up with \u201cPrelude to a Rose\u201d and \u201cDancing in the Canyon,\u201d which are fuller and richer and feature stellar improvisations by percussionist Kikanju Baku, trumpeter       Hugh Ragin,        percussionist, pianist and trombonist Tyshawn Sorey and pianist       Craig Taborn.       The music grows increasingly diverse and complex and concludes with \u201cOdwalla,\u201d the hard-bop theme Mr. Mitchell composed for the Art Ensemble that usually closed their shows.The range of sounds found on the new recording underscores that Mr. Mitchell\u2019s music is equally at home in contemporary classical and jazz circles. His solo and composing style is marked by a sober restraint. In the \u201990s, Mr. Mitchell formed bands with new-music stalwarts       Pauline Oliveros,       Gerald Oshita       and       Thomas Buckner.       His work has also found followers in rock; in 2012,       Jeff Mangum       of Neutral Milk Hotel invited Mr. Mitchell to perform at the All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties festival.Mr. Mitchell, who is 76 years old, was born in Chicago and grew up there. He began playing saxophone when he was 12, and he played in a band that included saxophone great       Albert Ayler       while stationed in Germany during a stint in the Army in the late \u201950s and early \u201960s. Upon his return to Chicago he began playing in       Muhal Richard       Abams\u2019s Experimental Band, a group that led to the formation of the AACM. Mr. Mitchell\u2019s career may be following the paths of fellow Experimental Band members       Wadada Leo Smith       and       Henry Threadgill,        both of whom are enjoying career renaissances in their 70s. The celebration of the group\u2019s 50th anniversary may have proved to be as much a look forward as a remembrance.\u2014       Mr. Johnson       writes about jazz for the Journal.", "news_time": "2017-07-10 14:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bells-for-the-south-side-by-roscoe-mitchell-review-a-life-in-jazz-1499711740", "news_title": "\u2018Bells for the South Side\u2019 by Roscoe Mitchell Review: A Life in Jazz", "keywords": "Roscoe Mitchell,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music"}, {"content": "Hallelujah for       Peter Cove\u2019s       \u201cGet Able-Bodied Americans off the Couch\u201d (op-ed, July 5). Our family has operated an industrial staffing business for over 55 years. In Erie, Pa., more than 25% of the population lives in poverty. Since the economy\u2019s rebound, we\u2019ve seen an explosion of industrial and other job opportunities with the vast majority representing pay well above the minimum wage. For the first time in our company\u2019s history, we cannot fill all of our job orders. How can this be in a city where more than a quarter of us are living in poverty? Mr. Cove provides the answer.Like a batter analyzing every pitch crossing the plate, those in poverty in our community have the luxury of saying \u201cno\u201d to a job and suffering no financial consequences when they choose not to work. Someone who refuses a job loses not one penny of cash assistance, nor his food-stamp vouchers, nor his Section 8 housing payments nor Medicaid assistance.While our industrial jobs may not be considered glamorous and often represent entry-level opportunities, they are a rung on the ladder. Those who take advantage of the opportunities offered get the start of a career and a better life in all respects. Our client employers hunger to find and foster the next generation of workers who will become tomorrow\u2019s craftsmen and journeymen.By offering work of any sort, we are inviting our fellow citizens to join civil society. The easy choice of perpetual welfare has fostered a system that denies dignity to hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens who need the personal, spiritual and financial benefits of work as all humans do.Martin J. FarrellInfinity Resources, Inc.Erie, Pa.As a practicing physician, I see difficulties implementing Mr. Cove\u2019s suggestions. Some of my unemployed patients are over 50, have a history of a previous back or similar injury, complain of anxiety and depression and, perhaps to top it off, have a history of drug abuse or previous jail time. Employers don\u2019t want to take the risk of employing such an individual as firing them might entail claims of age discrimination, payment for work-related injuries or legal liability if these individuals commit crimes while employed. Invariably these patients exaggerate their psychiatric symptoms when applying for disability (which may be their only legal way of receiving income).A person on Medicaid with significant and costly chronic medical problems who wants to work simply cannot afford to take the chance of losing public-health benefits as private insurance with its copays and deductibles are overwhelming at entry-level positions. Perhaps the U.S. has a bit of the French malaise in which interconnected laws make getting public assistance the only legitimate way for a certain segment of our population to survive.Robert Taylor Segraves, M.D.Shaker Heights, OhioMr. Cove\u2019s premise is that only 55% of American adults between the ages of 18 and 64 have full-time jobs. The operative word in that statement is \u201cfull time.\u201d What he doesn\u2019t mention about the nearly 95 million of working-age Americans who don\u2019t have full-time jobs is that 20.5 million of them are college students and very few of them could be working full time; that 37% of the households with children have one parent who chooses not to work; that the average retirement age across the U.S. is 63 and that 13% of all American workers retire in their 50s, and few of them continue to work at a full-time job. In other words, the majority of people not holding full-time jobs either can\u2019t because of school or choose not to because of children or retirement. Using the word \u201cfull time\u201d completely distorts the picture.Tim EdkinBellefonte, Pa.Would Mr. Cove consider my 20-year-old son Eric \u201cable-bodied\u201d? He has autism and functions at the intellectual level of a 6-year-old. In order for him to work or volunteer he would need a full-time aide.

The review is stuck in the trope that because Lincoln was always against slavery, which the book repeatedly affirms though the reviewer claims it doesn\u2019t, that Lincoln was also in favor of civil rights for blacks and a multiracial America. He was not. He believed that blacks and whites could never live together peacefully as equals in America. He feared there would be at least a century of racial conflict if over four million blacks became American citizens. All his adult life he favored colonization for free blacks and former slaves until his last six months, when he accepted its practical and moral impossibility.It is the reviewer who is cherry-picking the record in the interest of an idealized Lincoln. Our aim should be a balanced, overall view that takes all of Lincoln into account. It is desirable to be a realist about Lincoln, not a fantasist.

These closely watched \u201cunit revenue\u201d metrics had suffered amid a price war sparked by low fuel prices and the rapid expansion of discount carriers.Now big airlines are expanding \u201cbasic economy\u201d fares to compete with discounters, while also tapping new revenue streams from fees and premium ticket classes that offer more comfort and exclusivity.\u2018You\u2019re seeing increasing product and customer segmentation, which is generating higher average fares. \u2019\u201cYou\u2019re seeing increasing product and customer segmentation, which is generating higher average fares,\u201d said       Bryan Terry,        managing director of travel and transportation for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.American Airlines Group Inc.,        AAL -1.02%Delta Air Lines Inc.       and             United Continental Holdings Inc.       all are expected to show unit-revenue gains in the second quarter compared with big declines in that period a year earlier. Delta, which will report second-quarter results on Thursday, told investors last week to expect the first unit-revenue growth since the fourth quarter of 2014.Discounters             JetBlue                   Airways Corp. and             Spirit Airlines Inc.       are forecasting unit-revenue growth of at least 4% after double-digit declines a year ago.             Hawaiian Holdings Inc.       has forecast a unit-revenue increase of as much as 10.5%. Southwest on Monday reaffirmed guidance for growth of up to 2% in the second quarter, disappointing some investors hoping for a higher target.Nevertheless, such broadly positive results would help put the airline industry on track for its eighth straight year of profits in 2017, a record streak in a traditionally volatile industry buffeted by unpredictable changes in fuel prices, demand and global economic conditions. Many airline stocks are trading near their one-year highs.Many industry watchers see last year as a low point for airlines, coming at the end of a heated fare war. At the time, carriers blamed everything from geopolitical turmoil, the strong dollar and overcapacity for their poor performance. Only Southwest and Hawaiian eked out small unit-revenue gains for the second quarter last year.\u201cThe second quarter of 2016 was darn near a trough,\u201d said       Kristopher Kelley,        an equity analyst at Janus Henderson Group PLC.The tide began to turn early this year. Merrill Lynch expects steady unit-revenue gains through the year. Cowen & Co. thinks the second quarter will be a peak, due in part to more domestic airline capacity scheduled to come on line later this year.As discount carriers bring budget fares to more markets, American, Delta and United are using basic economy fares to attract more frugal travelers. These fares don\u2019t include many standard perks such as standing by for a different flight or receiving advanced seat assignments.The growth of discount carriers has pushed domestic ticket prices near historic, inflation-adjusted lows, even with change fees and checked-luggage prices added in. At the same time, major airlines are offering more options to travelers willing to pay more. Delta and American are introducing \u201cpremium economy\u201d seats on international routes that offer more perks than plain coach.             JetBlue,       long a single-cabin airline, offers a luxury first-class called Mint on some routes that is boosting its unit revenue.Airlines are also selling priority boarding and upgrades to business- and first-class, instead of awarding those perks to frequent fliers, said Mr. Terry of PwC.

It\u2019s 2017, lazybones\u2014nobody unplugs. I spent a half-hour this morning running around my in-laws\u2019 waterside idyll trying to locate Wi-Fi so I could file this column. When I finally got a strong enough signal to hit send, I celebrated as if I\u2019d landed a lunar module.My children are both under the age of 5, so there\u2019s not going to be a lot of hammock and cocktail time for their old man, anyway. These kids wake up at dawn with the roosters, and never stop running. The other day, my wife and I surrendered dreams of the Great Outdoors and took them to Chuck E. Cheese, the cacophonous kiddie entertainment palace where the goal is to spend less than $90 on videogames and lukewarm pizza. They were ecstatic with joy. For kids, Chuck E. Cheese is basically Hawaii.As you can tell, I\u2019m a little grumpy. I need exercise. But it\u2019s proving harder than it looks.Vacation exercise is an almost paradoxical concept. There was a time when exercise was one of those things, like the office, you took a vacation from\u2014you slept in, stayed up late, ate the food you wanted, drank sugary drinks with umbrellas, even though you knew they\u2019d give you a headache in the a.m. The most exercise you might get was carrying four chairs and a Styrofoam cooler across the beach. Or body-surfing. Your workout might be playing badminton for the one time every year you play badminton. Or mini golf. Regular golf! The perfect vacation exercise was 18 holes of meandering regular golf.Somewhere along the way, however, vacation exercise intensified. Sweat became as important as sunblock. In resort towns, there are now spinning classes and boot camps with all the cultishness of city and suburban fitness. Wearable, phone apps and remote coaching have made it easy to not miss a heartbeat or interval in marathon or triathlon prep. Amateur athletes no longer take holidays. Wake up at 5:45 and look out the window at the shoreline, and you\u2019ll see someone standing contemplatively by the water\u2014and then dropping to the sand to do a set of Burpees.Fitness fiends now even eat to win on vacation. The other day we went to a clam shack\u2014a citadel of deep fried deliciousness\u2014and it had a \u201chealthy options\u201d section on the menu. Let me repeat: healthy options at the CLAM SHACK.I could mock this, I really could. Fitness is another thing we\u2019ve dragged on vacation with us, along with our emails and conference calls. This is likely the exact opposite of healthy. We probably should let our down time be genuine down time, and stop importing all of our anxieties along with us.But I don\u2019t care. I want in. I want to be one of those smug vacation exercisers. I want to stay disciplined and fit and relentless. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s inconsistent with the idea of relaxing on vacation\u2014I am one of those hopeless weirdos who finds exercise relaxing. I want to feel purposeful. I want to keep my chiseled beach abdominals. (I do not have chiseled beach abdominals. My abdominals have the consistency of a rubber Richard Nixon Halloween mask.)This is how I think vacation exercise can be done:1. Keep a plan. Vacation exercise isn\u2019t a time for improvisation. There\u2019s no \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll jog home from the beach.\u201d Trust me: you aren\u2019t going to jog home from the beach. You\u2019re going to stop and have an ice cream sandwich. Develop a schedule and stick to it. Maybe you\u2019re the early riser cyclist, joining the local spandex pack. Maybe you like to run when the kids are taking a nap. Sunset yoga? Perfect. Swimming? Even better\u2014Swimming is the ultimate vacation two-fer. Whatever you do, consistency is everything. \u201cPlaying it by ear\u201d leads to\u2026beer. (Not that there is anything wrong with vacation beer.)2. Do the thing you love. Your summer vacation isn\u2019t the time you\u2019re suddenly, after 40 years, going to take up power-lifting. Keep it simple. If you\u2019re a jogger, jog. If you\u2019re a walker, walk. You might find that the activity you love is gloriously easier to do on vacation. For me, it\u2019s tennis. I live in New York City, where it\u2019s easier to build a farmhouse with your bare hands than find an open court to play tennis. As soon as we get out of town, I weep with happiness when I see all the available public courts.3. Sweat is sweat. You don\u2019t need any fancy sport or wicking clothes to get a vacation workout. My father-in-law, for example: he\u2019s old school. He\u2019s not the country club type. He\u2019s not going paddleboarding. He is, however, utterly content to spend a 90 degree vacation day with a pair of hedge clippers, or taking a shovel to dig out an old, decaying tree stump. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re telling me that digging out an old, decaying tree stump is less exercise than golf. Have you ever dug out an old, decaying tree stump? It might be more exercise than a decathlon. There\u2019s a reason my father-in-law can still beat me up.4. Eat that clam roll, for crying out loud. Come on. It\u2019s summer. I know it costs $22, and you\u2019re going to have to work out for an extra half-hour tomorrow, but live a little. You literally have the rest of the year to pretend you like kale.Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'How to Exercise on Vacation.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 14:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/exercise-on-vacation-essential-or-pure-evil-1499610819", "news_title": "Exercise on Vacation: Essential or Pure Evil?

Qatar denies the allegations and accused the bloc of Arab nations of waging a smear campaign.Top officials from the feuding nations have been passing through Washington in recent weeks, making their case to Mr. Tillerson and others.The U.S. diplomat first traveled to Kuwait and later will head to Saudi Arabia and Qatar to try to bring the sides closer to a solution.It is unclear if he will meet with Emirati and Bahraini officials this week.\u201cThe purpose of the trip is to explore the art of the possible of where a resolution can be found,\u201d said       R.C.

Mr. Tillerson throughout has urged calm and moderation, calling on both sides to take steps to de-escalate tensions, while President Donald Trump at first hailed the severing of ties to Qatar as evidence of his own successful visit to the region and part of a push to crack down on terrorism financing.But in a call last week with Egypt\u2019s President       Abdel Fattah Al Sisi,        Mr. Trump urged \u201call parties to negotiate constructively to resolve the dispute.\u201dThe Trump administration\u2019s priority in the conflict is making sure that all parties cut off funds to terror groups, Mr. Hammond said.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 13:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tillerson-starting-shuttle-diplomacy-in-middle-east-hoping-to-resolve-dispute-over-qatar-1499692007", "news_title": "Tillerson Starting Shuttle Diplomacy in Middle East, Hoping to Resolve Dispute Over Qatar", "keywords": "middle east,qatar,state department,trump administration,Exxon Mobil,XOM,Rex Tillerson,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "For some members of President       Donald Trump\u2019s       election integrity commission, the mounting pushback from states to a federal request for voter files has hit particularly close to home.In New Hampshire, two lawmakers last week filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State       Bill Gardner,        a Democrat who serves on the presidential commission, for agreeing to provide the state\u2019s public voter file. Joined by The American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire Foundation, they said Mr. Gardner doesn\u2019t have the authority to give that information to an entity that isn\u2019t a campaign, political committee or political party.In Maine, where commission member       Matthew Dunlap       serves as secretary of state, state law bars him from providing the commission with the requested information, and Mr. Dunlap, a Democrat, has said he won\u2019t do so.\u201cThe reaction has been pretty visceral,\u201d Mr. Dunlap said. \u201cPeople have been very up-in-arms about transmitting information, and, as it turned out, the law wouldn\u2019t allow us to do it.\u201dIndiana Secretary of State       Connie Lawson,        a Republican and a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s commission, has similarly said state law bars her from providing the information.The reactions are the latest against the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which has come under increasing fire from states and privacy advocates since being formed in May by Mr. Trump, who spent months promoting unsubstantiated claims that voter fraud tainted the 2016 election, to review the federal election process.Vice Chairman       Kris Kobach,        who also serves as Kansas secretary of state, sent a letter to all 50 states late last month requesting personal details about every registered voter\u2014including birth dates, political party affiliations and the last four digits of social security numbers\u2014and the elections they participated in since 2006, as permitted by state law.Many states swiftly criticized the request, saying it seeks information they consider sensitive and beyond their power to turn over and objecting to attempts to interfere in their operation of elections.Election experts have also raised concerns about cybersecurity threats the request poses\u2014including the suggestion that states send voter files over email\u2014and have questioned what the commission would be able to do with the information.On Friday, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., heard arguments on whether to block the commission\u2019s request, in a lawsuit filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center. The Washington-based privacy advocacy group has charged that compiling a national voter database, stored in the White House, would create \u201cstaggering\u201d issues of privacy.U.S. District Judge       Colleen Kollar-Kotelly       hasn\u2019t announced whether she will issue a temporary restraining order. On Monday, the commission sent a letter to states asking that they hold off submitting their voter data until the judge issues her ruling.The commission has defended its request, saying it is asking states to turn over only information they already make public as permitted by law.Marc Lotter,        press secretary to Vice President       Mike Pence,        who chairs the commission, said the commission would handle any personal information \u201cin accordance with all federal regulations and security protocols.\u201d He added that the information in question is \u201cpublic data that is already being provided and has been provided to state and national parties and campaign apparatuses for many, many years.\u201dMost states will provide, at a cost, the names, addresses and political affiliations of their voters to campaigns and other political entities, but prohibit the release of data such as the last four digits of voters\u2019 social security numbers.Mr. Lotter said 36 states have agreed to work with the commission or are providing their voters\u2019 information, but he declined to say whether that number includes states that have said the commission can pay for the data.A lawyer for the Justice Department told Judge Kollar-Kotelly on Friday that Arkansas was the only state so far to provide its voter files.\u201cThere\u2019s no way that the data\u2014even if they got it\u2014could be helpful to them,\u201d said       David Becker,        the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, who spent three years building a system currently used by 20 states to improve the accuracy of their voter files. He noted that the voter files ultimately provided to the commission would vary widely by state, making it difficult to conduct broad data analyses.The commission, which is also expected to examine voter suppression and registration processes, hasn\u2019t said exactly what it plans to do with the voter files. But finding fraudulent voter registrations is made difficult by the fact that millions of Americans share the same names and birthdays, complicating efforts to determine whether the same person is registered multiple times or if the voters simply share a name. The system Mr. Becker built relies on names, birthdays and addresses, as well as the last four digits of voters\u2019 social security numbers and drivers\u2019 license data, to allow states to find incorrect or fraudulent registrations.Finding noncitizens who are registered to vote is particularly difficult because there is no list of undocumented immigrants living illegally in the U.S. There is a database of information on noncitizens living legally in the U.S., but election experts say they are the least likely to vote fraudulently as doing so would lead to their legal status being revoked.Mr. Becker said compiling every state\u2019s voter information in one place could also pose a security risk, particularly as U.S. officials have raised concerns about ongoing Russian election hacking efforts. He pointed to Mr. Kobach\u2019s request in his letter that states send their voter files over email. The letter also offered the option of transmitting the information via a secure website.Last weekend, secretaries of state from across the nation gathered in Indianapolis for their biannual meeting, where they addressed, among other issues, concerns about Russian interference attempts. Mr. Kobach didn\u2019t attend, but at least four members of the commission were at the meeting. They weren\u2019t, however, permitted to discuss official commission matters in accordance with federal laws that require any meetings to be open to the public.The commission\u2019s first official meeting is scheduled to be held in Washington on July 19.Commission members have challenged the notion that the goal of the advisory committee is to support the president\u2019s claims of voter fraud.

The company, with around 55,000 staff, reduced its workforce by at least 5,000 last year, sources familiar with the matter have said.Adnoc\u2019s announcement comes as other major oil producers in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, have also unveiled plans to list their energy assets to raise cash for expansion amid low oil prices.The U.A.E. is the fourth-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.The country plans to boost its crude oil production capacity to 3.5 million barrels a day by 2018 and expand its petrochemical business.\u00a0The U.A.E. is also investing $35 billion to diversify its energy mix and reduce its dependence on natural gas imports for power generation.Write to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Abu Dhabi State Firm Weighs Public Listings.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 13:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-a-e-s-oil-company-eyes-partnerships-listing-some-businesses-1499688670", "news_title": "U.A.E.\u2019s Oil Company Eyes Partnerships, Listing Some Businesses", "keywords": "abu dhabi national oil company,adnoc,asset sales,ipo market,oil,uae oil output,Abu Dhabi National Oil,Total,TOT,FP.FR,corporate changes,stock listings,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,partnerships,collaborations,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,chemicals,basic materials,resources,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The two congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election have committed to a goal that has eluded almost every major probe on Capitol Hill in recent years: bipartisanship.The Senate and House intelligence committees are broadly examining Russian meddling in the election, including whether members of President       Donald Trump\u2019s       campaign colluded with Moscow.The leaders of each committee have pledged to produce a sole final report\u2014not separate ones from Republican and Democratic members\u2014on whether Russia ran a campaign of leaks and disinformation designed to boost Mr. Trump at the expense of Democratic rival       Hillary Clinton,        as asserted by key members of the U.S. intelligence community.Dueling reports from the investigations could heighten the partisan divide over the question of Russian interference, especially if the parties can\u2019t agree on the basic facts and final conclusions.Recent history suggests that a bipartisan conclusion to a major congressional investigation remains elusive as Congress has grown increasingly partisan. But the threat of interference by a foreign power in U.S. elections demands a sober and unified response to maintain public confidence in the democratic system of governance, lawmakers have said.Rep.       Mike Conaway       (R., Texas), the leader of the House Intelligence Committee investigation, said in June that \u201cwe have an active investigation going on. We\u2019re pursuing it aggressively, we\u2019re pursuing it on a bipartisan basis.\u201d His Democratic counterpart on the panel, Adam Schiff of California, said a month earlier that the two men were working well together and that Mr. Conaway \u201chas made every effort to run the investigation in a nonpartisan fashion.\u201dOn the Senate side, Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R., N.C.) and Vice Chairman       Mark Warner       (D., Va.) both have pledged to conduct a nonpartisan probe. Mr. Burr said in March that he had \u201chigh hopes that we can reach a conclusion that has bipartisan support.\u201dLongtime observers of such congressional inquiries remain skeptical.\u201cI don\u2019t think Congress could mount a successful bipartisan investigation if it wanted to,\u201d said       Paul Light,        a New York University professor who has studied government investigations. \u201cThere aren\u2019t strong leaders in either chamber who can come together and work this through.\u201dCongress did conduct major bipartisan investigations in the 1970s, including the Church Committee inquiry into intelligence agencies spying on such citizens as Civil Rights leader       Martin Luther King Jr.       as well as the Watergate probe into President       Richard Nixon\u2019s       conduct in office.But a review of investigations over the past 25 years shows they more often became bogged down by distrust between Republicans and Democrats from start to finish.\u201dWe tend to look at the ones like Watergate, the Church Committee as successes,\u201d said       Peter Tyler,        an investigator at the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight, who worked on Capitol Hill investigations as a Democratic staffer. \u201cThose were some time ago,\u201d he said.Though sniping between partisans in Congress is as old as the republic itself, conflict over investigations intensified in the mid-1990s during the battles between President       Bill Clinton\u2019s       Democratic administration and a GOP Congress that culminated in his impeachment by the House on charges of obstruction of justice. The Senate refused to affirm those charges and remove him from office.During President       George W. Bush\u2019s       term, a GOP-led inquest into the government response to Hurricane Katrina was boycotted by Democrats. And most Republicans on the Democratic-led Senate Intelligence Committee refused to sign onto the committee\u2019s report on the CIA\u2019s interrogation programs after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington.Later, the Republican-led congressional investigation into the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks was assaulted by Democrats as a political exercise aimed at damaging Mrs. Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the attacks. During President       Barack Obama\u2019s       administration, probes of a federal gunrunning program dubbed Fast and Furious and the political targeting of conservative groups by the Internal Revenue Service also were dismissed as politically motivated.Independent commissions created by Congress, sometimes called blue-ribbon panels, have at times fared better. The 9/11 Commission report was widely lauded, though it avoided some of the thornier questions about those responsible for preventing such attacks.More recently, however, the GOP-appointed commissioners on the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that studied the 2008 recession refused to sign a report written by a majority of Democratic commissioners.Carl Levin, a former Democratic senator from Michigan, agreed that the political climate has become more acrimonious. But he pointed to several probes he conducted or participated in while on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations as evidence that the two parties could cooperate.\u201cIt\u2019s proven and doable,\u201d said Mr. Levin, who ran investigations into the collapse of energy giant Enron, among others. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to have leaders in the committees who trust each other, like each other, and get their staff on board.\u201dWrite to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 13:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bipartisan-conclusions-to-election-meddling-probes-may-be-elusive-1499706257", "news_title": "Bipartisan Conclusions to Election-Meddling Probes May Be Elusive ", "keywords": "2016 election,election,hillary clinton,house,presidential campaign,putin,russia,russian hacking,russian meddling,senate,trump,Intelligence Committee,Senate Intelligence Committee,The Senate,Richard Burr,Donald Trump,Adam Schiff,Mark Warner,Mike Conaway,political,general news,national,public security,politics,international relations,domestic politics,espionage,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,presidential elections"}, {"content": "After two months of trying to sell itself,             Abercrombie & Fitch        ANF 2.80%       is going it alone.

Unfortunately for Abercrombie, whose sales have fallen for four straight years, the announcement likely means a continuation of its downward trajectory. There is also a read-across for other struggling apparel retailers: don\u2019t expect to be bailed out by private equity or peers.Abercrombie initially sparked interest from both groups. Private-equity firms, which have become more wary of taking on debt to buy struggling retailers, likely drove a hard bargain. As             Amazon.com                   delves deeper into apparel, a clothing retailer\u2019s survival depends on its ability to invest in e-commerce while closing physical stores. Abercrombie had net cash on its balance sheet as of the end of the first quarter, but is one of the most heavily indebted retailers if lease obligations are factored in. That may have limited a private-equity firm\u2019s ability to borrow to do a deal.For peers such as Express and             American Eagle Outfitters,       both of which were interested in Abercrombie, the benefits of taking over a company with a flagging namesake brand were already limited. They could have gotten Abercrombie\u2019s better performing Hollister brand while taking out a competitor, but the retailers\u2019 capital would likely be better spent bolstering their own e-commerce operations than in eliminating an already shrinking rival.Abercrombie\u2019s shares fell to their lowest level in 17 years Monday, a sign that investors don\u2019t expect another deal, or a revival of the chain on its own.

This risk-moderating step expands existing safety measures already required on extended-release pain drugs.\u201cIt\u2019s time to take direct action to address the close to 200 million opioid analgesic prescriptions each year that are for the immediate release products,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cThe new training will be aimed at making sure providers who write prescriptions for the IR opioids are doing so for properly indicated patients, and under appropriate clinical circumstances.\u201dThe commissioner said the FDA now would require that training of health-care personnel will broaden information about nondrug, and non-opioid, approaches to controlling pain. He said the agency also will institute a study of doctors\u2019 understanding of abuse-deterrent features of various pain drugs.\u201cThe potential for abuse doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with the potential for addiction,\u201d he said. \u201cPatients can still become addicted to opioid products with abuse deterrent features. We need to make sure these different risks are fully understood\u201d by health-care personnel and patients.Dr. Gottlieb added that doctors and dentists are still writing too many 30-day prescriptions for opioid painkillers. Too often, patients who have undergone dental procedures or minor surgical procedures receive 30-day prescriptions when a prescription of shorter duration\u2014or no opioids at all\u2014would be more appropriate, he said, adding that the FDA will examine whether there are steps it can take to change this practice.Dr. Gottlieb said the agency would also consider legal action on any drugs that it concludes pose a larger risk than benefit. The FDA did that last month when it concluded that the painkiller Opana ER was linked to injection drug abuse. Its maker,             Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.,pulled the drug from the market last week at the FDA\u2019s request.The FDA is taking the action at a time of growing public awareness of, and political pressure over, the potential dangers from the panoply of prescription painkillers and their abuse. Concern over such drugs also extends to illegal narcotics like heroin and black-market fentanyl.In 2013, the agency added stronger language to some painkiller drug labels, to underscore risks of addiction. It also removed language saying that extended-release forms of certain products could be used for \u201cmoderate\u201d pain. The newer labels call for their use for \u201cpain severe enough to require daily, around the clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.\u201d\u2014Jeanne Whalen contributed to this article.Write to Thomas M.

The market was placed under the CFTC\u2019s jurisdiction as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.While data repositories, which are approved by regulators, must submit post-trade data to the CFTC, there are no firm guidelines governing data standardization. The CFTC\u2019s new effort attempts to change that. A recent CFTC inspector-general report criticized current data collection, saying current data was \u201cessentially unusable.\u201d\u201cWe look forward to working with all stakeholders\u2014including market participants, [swap data repositories], and our fellow regulators\u2014to ensure that we have the optimal data and swap reporting regime,\u201d CFTC acting Chairman       J. Christopher Giancarlo       said in a statement.The announcement kicks off a 40-day comment period, which will be followed by specific rule proposals. The CFTC said it was aiming for full industry implementation by the end of 2019.The inspector general\u2019s recent report chided the CFTC for its handling of swaps data collection, saying it was \u201cinexplicable\u201d that the agency would require firms to report certain types of data but not coordinate with the firms on standardized reporting methods.The inspector general\u2019s warning cited an internal 2016 CFTC report on swaps data showing that significant amounts of information were \u201cessentially unusable\u201d due to the poor quality of the data. The report noted \u201coutdated mark-to-market valuations; illogical or impossible values; incorrect product classifications; incorrect cleared status; and an unworkable mishmash of firm ID formats.\u201dAs a result, the inspector general said, \u201ctrillions of dollars of notional positions are \u2018unpriceable\u2019 and represent an \u2018unmeasurable amount of risk.\u2019Swaps are derivatives contracts in which two parties agree to exchange payments based on fluctuations in certain benchmarks. Companies use these contracts to hedge risks or make bets in such areas as fuel prices or interest rates.After the financial crisis, Congress and regulators changed reporting requirements with the goal of shining a light on a notoriously opaque market and, in the event of another crisis, to help unwind failing market participants that posed a risk to the entire system.The review was announced jointly by Mr. Giancarlo and Democratic Commissioner Sharon Bowen, who has announced her intent to step down in the coming months, which would leave the commission with just Mr. Giancarlo as a sitting commissioner.Mr. Giancarlo\u2014as well as members of Congress\u2014have urged the Trump administration to move forward with nominations for new commissioners, and he has shown a traditional reluctance to pursue major rule making without at least three commissioners.His own nomination to serve as permanent chairman is currently awaiting a vote in the Senate after he was approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee by a 16-5 vote in June.

Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Jacob Meade.Retirement plans sponsored by nonprofit groups haven\u2019t been a common target of legal action or scrutiny. Yet now that the 403(b) plans of private nonprofit groups are officially subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa, we\u2019ve seen an increase in lawsuits by participants against some universities and other plan sponsors.Legal action against outright fraud is one thing, but a number of newer lawsuits have made allegations concerning high fees and lack of due diligence related to the investment options. Against this backdrop, advisers can help protect clients who are nonprofit board members by addressing personal liability they may be exposed to as a result of board membership.When a person works on a nonprofit board or investment committee, they can become a fiduciary and can potentially be held personally liable for any settlements that result from lawsuits in relation to the nonprofit group\u2019s retirement plan. While rare, being personally sued due to one\u2019s board involvement in a 403(b) is a concerning possibility. Yet clients, who are understandably occupied by the positive efforts of their nonprofit group, sometimes don\u2019t pause to consider how personally liable they may be.Advisers can help these clients by starting a discussion about liability and the related pitfalls they should avoid. If your client learns they do have fiduciary responsibility for their nonprofit group\u2019s retirement plan, they should work to build in as many protections as they can with the organization to help ensure their personal wealth is protected. The nonprofit group\u2019s resolutions governing 403(b) duties and administration may have been written a long time ago, in which case they may need to be updated. For example, there may need to be a formal process of due diligence, funds oversight and expense reporting as measures that can protect fiduciaries, participants and the nonprofit group alike. The nonprofit group might also purchase insurance to cover the plan\u2019s fiduciaries, or consult an Erisa attorney to ensure the plan is in compliance.A person\u2019s financial adviser may be the only one in their life who is aware of considerations like these. So you can deliver a valuable service to your client simply by tuning them in to the issue in the first place.Ultimately, of course, clients need to make their own choices about the risks they\u2019re willing to take in their board work with different organizations. But by getting them to think about those organizations\u2019 retirement plans and fiduciary roles, you can help them successfully navigate this important issue while further positioning yourself to be your client\u2019s backstop for any financial eventuality.", "news_time": "2017-07-10 12:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/helping-clients-navigate-liabilities-from-work-on-nonprofits-boards-1499703067", "news_title": "Helping Clients Navigate Liabilities From Work on Nonprofits\u2019 Boards", "keywords": "marketing,markets,corporate,industrial news,customer relationship management,political,general news,personal finance,retirement planning,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "NJ Transit passengers entered the Hoboken PATH station during Monday morning\u2019s rush hour.Suburban commuters received a pleasant surprise on Monday.Following weeks of warnings about a \u201csummer of hell,\u201d their journeys on the first day of a 20% service reduction at New York Penn Station mostly ran smoothly.\u201cMy whole commute added 10 minutes,\u201d said James Heacock of Maplewood, N.J., as he rode a PATH train to Hoboken at about 5 p.m. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201dThe governors of New York and New Jersey had warned of nightmare commutes earlier this year after Amtrak, which operates Penn Station, announced it would close several tracks from July 10 to Sept. 1 following two low-speed derailments. Last week, as engineers carried out early repair work to rails and switches, a third train derailed at the station.The Long Island Rail Road and NJ Transit, which carry more than 400,000 passengers in and out of Penn Station on a typical weekday, diverted tens of thousands of people to stations in Queens, Brooklyn and Hoboken, N.J.The two railroads posted hundreds of representatives at suburban stations and transit hubs offering advice on how commuters could transfer to the subway, ferries, buses and the PATH rail system.Many commuters said they left home a little earlier than usual in the morning and that they expected their commute to take longer than normal.\u201cI think expectations were pretty low,\u201d said Vicky Sherman as she sat on a NJ Transit train waiting to depart Hoboken for Maplewood just after 6 p.m. She said her morning commute had taken about the same time as it would have had she traveled through Penn Station. \u201cI was pretty happy,\u201d she added.New York Gov.

Although passageways and platforms were more crowded than usual, they cleared quickly.The LIRR added extra cars to its surviving services into Penn Station to cope with additional demand, as well as several extra trains outside of peak hours. The two railroads also added plenty of transit alternatives for diverted passengers, not all of them popular.The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the LIRR, ran 200 buses from eight park-and-rides scattered across Long Island.At one drop-off point outside Grand Central Terminal around 9:30 a.m. one bus pulled in empty. At about 10 a.m. a second bus pulled in carrying one passenger from Roslyn, N.Y., who said her commute had taken two hours, about 40 minutes longer than usual.A spokesman for the MTA declined to say how many people had taken the bus service. At an evening news conference at Penn Station, Joe Lhota, the chairman of the MTA, said: \u201cThe buses were not used as much as we thought but it\u2019s only been one day.\u201dMr. Lhota said there was an 8% drop in number of passengers to Penn Station on Monday.

About 7,000 commuters headed to Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, he said, while around 3,000 headed to Hunterspoint in Queens.\u201cWe hoped for the best and got the best,\u201d he added.At Hoboken, NJ Transit passengers could transfer for free to a temporary ferry service to Midtown Manhattan.A NJ Transit spokesman said that 8,700 Morris and Essex Lines customers traveled to Hoboken on Monday morning in addition to the 4,000 people on those lines who normally use the terminal.Even so, just 1,264 people took the ferry, less than the 2,000 passengers the rail company had expected. \u201cIt is just the first day and it is too soon to tell how this service might grow,\u201d the spokesman said.Toward the end of the evening rush in Hoboken five trains were canceled because of staff shortages, a NJ Transit spokeswoman said.As he waited for an LIRR train at about 5 p.m., Anthony Plank, a Wantaugh, commuter said his morning railroad trip was fine. It was the E trained that delayed him.When asked whether he thought officials overreacted to the anticipated problems, with Mr. Cuomo calling it the \u201csummer of hell,\u201d he said he would rather have them overprepare because it\u2019s \u201calways such a mess.\u201d\u2014Mike Vilensky  contributed to this article.Write to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.com and Mike Vilensky at mike.vilensky@dowjones.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 12:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-new-york-commuters-day-one-of-summer-of-hell-starts-out-less-hellish-than-feared-1499700073", "news_title": "For N.Y.

TCEHY 3.69%       and private-equity firms TPG and Warburg Pincus, has said it is keen to expand to the U.S. but hasn\u2019t said where.The firm and its main rival has risen to prominence in their homeland but aren\u2019t without their challenges: They are likely to face tight government restrictions, and their business models remain unproven.A Mobike spokeswoman didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.One of the jobs posted on the professional networking site LinkedIn is for an operation manager, based in the Washington, D.C. area, who would need to get to know \u201cthe local environment\u201d and \u201cbe the main point of contact for the regional government officials and Transport Authorities,\u201d according to the listing. The other position is for a social media professional to work with the company\u2019s prospective community of users.Mobike and its Chinese rival, Beijing-based Ofo Inc., have scaled up swiftly at home in recent months, with both boasting fleets of more than five million bikes, up from a combined total of more than 100,000 in October. They both operate in more than 100 cities globally, though most are in China.Both offer \u201cdockless\u201d bike-sharing, allowing users to find and rent the two-wheelers via smartphones, picking them up or returning them in places like sidewalks and bike racks rather than typical docking stations.That means convenience for riders but can also lead to bikes strewn about in public places. Earlier in the year, there were reports in China of bikes being vandalized, stolen, and even thrown into trees and rivers by riders.Mobike raised $600 million in new funding in June to expand its operations globally. Its recent round of funding values it at about $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.Mobike is looking to expand overseas as it taps demand for urban transportation alternatives. The company has expanded into Singapore, Japan and the U.K. this year and aims to double the number of cities it operates in to 200 by the end of the year.It started its dockless bike-sharing services in Chinese cities in April last year. Ofo, which counts             Alibaba Group Holding                   and Hony Capital among its backers, wants to reach 200 cities in 20 countries by year-end.Regulation has proved to be stumbling blocks for such dockless bike-sharing companies in the U.S. Chinese startup Bluegogo International Inc. had to alter its initial plans and use private parking spaces instead of public bike racks for its shared bikes in San Francisco after talks with city officials.Other similar startups include Neutron Holdings Inc.\u2019s Limebike, a California-based startup that operates in California, North Carolina, Florida and Seattle.Ofo, meanwhile, said in March it is running trials in San Diego, CA.Write to Newley Purnell at newley.purnell @wsj.com and Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'China\u2019s Mobike Gears Up for U.S..'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 12:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-bike-sharing-titan-mobike-sets-sights-on-washington-d-c-1499702471", "news_title": "China Bike-Sharing Titan Mobike Sets Sights on Washington, D.C.

The two OPEC members were exempted from an agreement to cut production last year because their oil industries had been crippled by internal strife, but they have since ramped up output.Those increases have dragged on the efforts of OPEC and 10 other producers to raise prices with a nearly 1.8-million-barrel-a-day production cut.Oil supply levels remain high, reflecting a global glut that has kept prices below $50 a barrel.Libya\u2019s production has more than doubled to one million barrels a day\u2014the first time it has breached that threshold in four years. Nigerian output has increased to more than 1.5 million barrels a day.The Wall Street Journal reported last week that OPEC and Russia\u2014the biggest non-OPEC producer that agreed to cut production\u2014were considering\u00a0the possibility of capping Libya and Nigeria. Such a move could cause strife within OPEC, which requires unanimity to make output decisions.Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an Istanbul oil conference, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq said Libya and Nigeria were likely to send officials to the July 24 meeting in St. Petersburg, where OPEC and its non-OPEC allies have planned to discuss compliance with their agreement.According to people familiar with the matter, OPEC wants Libya and Nigeria to talk about what level of production they would sustainably maintain.In Istanbul, Russia\u2019s energy minister,       Alexander Novak,        said he also discussed\u00a0rising Libya and Nigerian oil production with OPEC Secretary-General\u00a0      Mohammed Barkindo.      \u00a0Mr. Novak also met Mustafa Sanallah, chairman of Libya\u2019s National Oil Co.\u201cLibya can play a constructive role in stabilizing oil markets by informing OPEC and markets about its plans to restore production,\u201d Mr. Sanallah said in a statement.But he added, \u201cLibya\u2019s political, humanitarian and economic situation needs to be taken into account if we are going to talk about production caps.\u201dMr. Sanallah didn\u2019t say whether he will attend the meeting.Nigerian oil officials didn\u2019t respond to requests to comment. Nigeria has said it would consider limiting its output once it determined whether its recent rally is sustainable.Kuwait\u2019s Mr. Almarzooq said deeper production cuts were \u201cnot on the agenda\u201d and there are signs the cartel\u2019s strategy is working.Last week, U.S. shale production and oil inventories fell, which is \u201call in favor our side,\u201d the minister said.Write to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Libya, Nigeria Face OPEC Scrutiny.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 12:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/libya-nigeria-invited-to-meeting-of-oil-producers-1499702640", "news_title": "Libya, Nigeria Invited to Meeting of Oil Producers ", "keywords": " non-opec,opec, output,production, production cuts,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,Issam Almarzooq,Mustafa Sanallah,Mohammed Barkindo,output,corporate,industrial news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction"}, {"content": "Snack and beverage giant             PepsiCo Inc.

RBC Capital Markets analyst       Nik Modi       said in a note Monday that this \u201ccenter of the store\u201d pressure could also weigh on the results of PepsiCo\u2019s Frito-Lay North America unit.

Similar taxes took effect on July 1 in Oakland, Calif., and Boulder, Colo. Pepsi said in March that it would lay off 80 to 100 workers at three distribution plants, as a result of what it described as a sales slump prompted by Philadelphia\u2019s tax on sweetened drinks.

To set up these \u201cblind dates,\u201d the stores wrap the book to hide the cover and offer a few clues to give a sense of the hidden work\u2019s genre and tone.\u201cIt\u2019s been the most successful table we\u2019ve ever put together,\u201d says Cari Quartuccio of the blind-date offerings at a location of Book Culture, where she is the store manager. Book Culture has three stores in New York City. The program started in the fall and focuses on what Ms. Quartuccio calls \u201cunder-read classics\u201d\u2014works she and other Book Culture staffers believe don\u2019t get the attention they deserve.Booksellers cite various inspirations for their blind-date programs, including similar ones at local libraries or other bookshops. An employee of Malaprop\u2019s Bookstore/Cafe in Asheville, N.C., recalls first seeing it at a shop in Germany.For customers, trusting the staff at their local store is part of the fun. The clues allow readers to select a gift for themselves. (And then, of course, immortalize unwrapping the mystery volume on Instagram.)At Book Culture, blind-date offerings are wrapped in brown paper and bear a note advising \u201cRead me if you liked\u201d and a list of three books staff members think customers are likely to have read. One of their most frequently selected blind-date books, Ms. Quartuccio says, lists the novels \u201cThe Help,\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019d You Go, Bernadette?\u201d and \u201cThe Secret History.\u201d Inside, readers find Marisha Pessl\u2019s \u201cSpecial Topics in Calamity Physics,\u201d a 2006 novel about a highly intelligent teen who finds herself simultaneously navigating new friends and investigating a suspicious death.Figuring out which titles attract readers is a matter of trial and error. Ms. Quartuccio thinks a wrapped-up copy of Edward Abbey\u2019s 1968 work \u201cDesert Solitaire\u201d didn\u2019t do well because not enough customers loved its \u201cRead me if you liked\u201d list, which included \u201cInto the Wild\u201d and \u201cA Walk in the Woods.\u201dMalaprop\u2019s Bookstore/Cafe rotates more than 350 titles through its blind-date section, which includes about 30 adult and 12 young-adult choices. Staff members use adjectives rather than titles to orient readers. For example, blind offering number 171, described on its wrapper as \u201csizzling,\u201d \u201cuncanny,\u201d \u201crhapsodic\u201d and \u201ctragic,\u201d is Jeffrey Eugenides\u2019s 1993 debut novel, \u201cThe Virgin Suicides.\u201dStaff members, who can add books to the blind-date rotation, enjoy coming up with evocative modifiers. Any sale in the section, owner Em\u00f6ke B\u2019Racz says, \u201cstrictly goes by how successful the description is.\u201dHooking younger readers is bookseller Rachel Strolle\u2019s goal at the flagship location of family-owned Anderson\u2019s Bookshop in Naperville, Ill. She focuses her blind selections on young-adult and middle-grade books and sells most within a couple of weeks of displaying them. Her clues include colorful drawings and whimsical synopses. Readers unwrap \u201cOf Fire and Stars\u201d by Audrey Coulthurst after being drawn in by the summary that, \u201cOnce upon a time,\u201d a princess traveled to meet her would-be prince, \u201cand ended up falling in love with his sister instead.\u201d Since starting the program at the Naperville location a year ago, Ms. Strolle has sold 700 covered books to young readers.A description on a covered volume intrigued Rachel Vamenta on a recent visit to Chop Suey Books. The tag read: \u201cWe just came to America. Please show me your ways, don\u2019t worry about my parents.\u201d\u201cI come from an immigrant family,\u201d says the 30-year-old Ms. Vamenta, who is a longtime customer of the Richmond, Va., used bookstore. \u201cWhen I saw that description, I thought, \u2018Oh, perfect.\u2019 \u201dShe unwrapped \u201cThe Namesake,\u201d by Jhumpa Lahiri. \u201cIt was so funny, because I\u2019ve been meaning to read \u2018The Namesake\u2019 forever,\u201d Ms. Vamenta says of her $5 purchase.New \u201cblind date\u201d books usually go for retail prices but Oblong Books & Music in Rhinebeck, N.Y., has devoted its surplus of advance reader copies\u2014preliminary editions sent to stores before the actual book is released\u2014to raising funds for the local library. For $1, customers can select a volume from a bin of adult and children\u2019s wrapped books with either a short summary or similar authors as clues.In addition to helping the library, the blind book grab-bag has been a great advertisement for Oblong, says Nicole Brinkley, the store\u2019s director of special projects. She recalls one boy immediately loving his blind book about cats that are astronauts. He showed it to friends, Ms. Brinkley says, and two of them ordered the book.The Book Cellar in Chicago limited its blind-date section to the month of February, embracing a Valentine\u2019s theme and adorning wrapped books with bright pink hearts and descriptions akin to dating profiles. The hints were meant to be \u201csomething airy that would give customers enough information to know if it was something they were interested in, but hopefully without spoiling too much,\u201d says Liz Rice, of the Book Cellar. Clues with pop-culture references did well, she says, like the one reading, \u201cIntelligent, surprising, and witty. For fans of \u2018Arrested Development.\u2019 \u201d Inside the wrapper was Maria Semple\u2019s \u201cWhere\u2019d You Go, Bernadette?\u201dAn honest description of a blind-date book, such as David Foster Wallace\u2019s \u201cInfinite Jest,\u201d doesn\u2019t always captivate many readers, Ms. Rice says. But the Book Cellar included his 1,000-plus-page work because the staff enjoyed writing the description: \u201cFor someone looking for a long-term commitment. At times I\u2019m a bit complicated and bit hard to read. (Pun intended.) But totally worth it in the end.\u201d A couple of people bought \u201cInfinite Jest,\u201d Ms. Rice says.Book Culture\u2019s Ms. Quartuccio says customers seldom are lukewarm about the notion of blind-date books. Fans often make repeat purchases, with some even buying stacks as gifts. Other customers are perplexed by the idea. Finally, she says, there are those \u201cwho get really upset when we won\u2019t tell them the title of the book.

The exchange said total volume and participation in June and July has broken a series of record highs.\u201cPeople are forced to pay attention,\u201d said       Michael McDougall,        commodities director at             Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale                   in New York, who said his clients had started placing bets in the spring wheat futures market.The proportion of hedge funds and other money managers betting on spring wheat contracts has almost doubled since May, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows.Farmers sowed the fewest acres of wheat in a century this year. A global grain glut exacerbated by booming production in countries like Russia has depressed prices and, along with a strong dollar, made U.S. wheat farmers less competitive, prompting some to fallow fields or switch to soybeans and corn.Now weeks of hot, dry weather in the\u00a0Dakotas and Minnesota have been particularly hard on spring wheat, prized for high protein content that makes it well-suited for specialty breads and pastries.That could mean higher food prices for consumers if millers end up paying more for high-quality wheat, said       Brian Hoops       of brokerage Midwest Market Solutions.The share of spring wheat in good or excellent condition fell to 37% earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said, compared with 72% the same time last year. That is the lowest good-or-excellent rating in almost 30 years.After rising to a four-year high Wednesday, spring wheat futures fell last week before rebounding 4% Monday morning to $7.97 1/2 a bushel.\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone expected...so much high-protein wheat would be destroyed at a level that would move these markets,\u201d said       Virginia McGathey,        a grain options trader at the Chicago Board of Trade.U.S. wheat plantings have been shrinking for decades. For much of that time higher yields made up for the shrinking land mass devoted to the grain, keeping U.S. wheat production relatively flat. But less acreage could make U.S. wheat prices more vulnerable to price shocks in the future when droughts strike arid regions like the Plains, Rabobank said.\u201cFlour mills and bakers will do what is necessary to secure their supplies,\u201d said       Ken Morrison,        a St. Louis trader and commodity newsletter author who bought spring wheat contracts this month.

The decline is small and comes after a series of large increases since early 2017,\u201d said Gad Levanon, chief economist, North America, at the Conference Board.Mr. Levanon added he expects employment to grow fast enough to continue tightening the labor market and cause stronger wage growth later this year.Three of the basket\u2019s eight indicators fell in June, with the largest decline coming from the \u201cpercentage of firms with positions not able to fill right row,\u201d which fell to 30 from 34 in May.Write to Justina Vasquez at justina.vasquez@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 11:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/conference-boards-employment-trends-index-fell-in-june-1499699661", "news_title": "Conference Board\u2019s Employment Trends Index Fell in June", "keywords": "conference board,employment trends index, job growth,u.s. economic growth,Conference Board,economic performance,indicators,employment,unemployment,economic news,political,general news,general labor issues"}, {"content": "A popular British-born running program aims to answer a strange question: Will Americans take something free that they\u2019re already paying for?It\u2019s called Parkrun, and it\u2019s very simple. Participants register online once and print out a personal bar code. They bring the code to a participating park, where 5K runs are held every Saturday, usually at 9 a.m. The registrants run\u2014or walk\u2014the course, scan their bar code with a volunteer at the finish, then head to a nearby coffee shop to hang out with other Parkrunners.There are no road closures or finish-line ceremonies, it runs every week of the year and it costs nothing.Parkrun is part of a larger trend of organized free exercise, from online-streaming classes to public workouts such as the November Project, that\u2019s challenging the established fitness industry.Over the past decade, Parkrun has spread to more than 450 parks in the U.K., and to 13 other countries. With about 200,000 weekly participants world-wide, Parkrun is four times the size of the New York City Marathon.But it\u2019s not a race. There are no placement awards, and the only free T-shirts are for milestones like running 50 Parkruns or volunteering 25 times. That model has puzzled some in the U.S., where half-marathons give all finishers a medal and many 5K races cost $30 or more.\u201cEveryone assumes there\u2019s a catch,\u201d says       Daniel Whitehouse,        a Parkrun volunteer run director and participant in Clermont, Fla., west of Orlando, one of a dozen Parkrun locations in the U.S. \u201cAnd the catch is, you have to show up with your bar code. We want you to show up again, is the other catch.\u201dMr. Whitehouse, a 37-year-old attorney and father of two, credits an improved diet and two years of Parkruns with helping him lose and keep off 90 pounds. He tracks his improving run times on the Parkrun website, and other Parkrun regulars cheer him on, he says.\u201cIf you don\u2019t show up one week, people are asking where the heck you were,\u201d says Mr. Whitehouse, who\u2019s training for a half-Ironman triathlon. About 85 people a week run or walk the Clermont Parkrun.Parkrun is funded through sponsorships and grants, and staffed locally by volunteers. Its first U.S. location launched in 2012, in suburban Detroit. Parkrun relaunched last year in the U.S., naming a full-time country manager and establishing a U.S. nonprofit organization to make it easier to add locations.U.S. Parkruns have sprung up in places as varied as the comfortable Twin Cities suburb of Eagan, Minn., and Baltimore\u2019s Leakin Park, featured in the true-crime story on season one of the podcast \u201cSerial.\u201dA recent Parkrun in College Park, Md., drew Christian boot-camp members of varying fitness levels, a former university runner from the U.K. and a mother and her grinning 4-year-old son, among more than 100 participants. Runners funneled into a finishers\u2019 chute of a few orange cones laid out by husband-and-wife organizers       Colin Phillips       and       Andrea Zukowski,        then sipped water.Parkruns in the U.S. face more weather extremes than the temperate U.K. The Livonia, Mich., Parkrun often alters the course to adjust to snow and ice in the winter, organizer       Spencer Greve       says. The Florida Parkrun starts at 7:30 a.m. to avoid summer heat, though a few of the British tourists who frequent the run struggle with it anyway.\u201cWe\u2019ve had some passing out,\u201d event director       Kimberly Grogan       says, though no incidents serious enough to need medical attention. \u201cOur regulars are pretty used to it.\u201dAvid runner       Paul Sinton-Hewitt       launched Parkrun in 2004 in a London park to stem a personal downward spiral after he was fired from his marketing job and injured in a fall while running. Other people liked the social, weekly runs so much that he agreed to expand the program, and Parkrun spread.\u201cI had no idea that it would become the organization that it is,\u201d he says.A representative from New York Road Runners, which operates the New York City Marathon and dozens of other races, met with Parkrun organizers in April 2015 in London to discuss the program, Mr. Sinton-Hewitt recalls. About two months later, New York Road Runners launched Open Run, a program of free, timed, weekly runs about 5K long, based in parks.Mr. Sinton-Hewitt says large U.S. running organizations, which generate revenue from memberships and race fees, see Parkrun as a threat.Peter Ciaccia,        co-president of New York Road Runners, says Open Run was already in the works by April 2015, and that it\u2019s an extension of initiatives such as NYRR\u2019s free running programs for children.\u201cI don\u2019t see Parkrun being a threat to anything that we\u2019re doing here in New York,\u201d Mr. Ciaccia says.About a year ago the Chicago Area Runners Association started \u2019Go Runs: park-based, free 5K and one-mile timed runs that were inspired by Parkrun, CARA executive director       Greg Hipp       says.\u201cThere\u2019s certainly a lot of room for this type of program, whether it\u2019s through Parkrun or through another running organization, to bring grass-roots running back in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Hipp says.Some runners say the rise in race fees has contributed to a dip in running participation. (The 5K and half-marathon distances are exceptions, seeing modest growth.) On average in 2016, a 5K entry cost $26 and a marathon more than $85, according to online-registration company RunSignUp.Parkrun fans say its allure transcends running. British-born       Rosemary Paul,        who lives in Dover, Del., misses her former Parkrun northeast of London so much that she\u2019s made several two-hour trips to Washington, D.C.-area Parkruns. The 58-year-old longtime runner loved the post-run gatherings at a nearby tea room, where people celebrated milestones with cake.\u201cIt\u2019s the community spirit,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople become close through going to Parkrun.\u201dWrite to Rachel Bachman at rachel.bachman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'The Rise of The Free 5K.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 10:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/parkrun-lovers-ask-why-pay-to-run-a-5k-1499697587", "news_title": "Parkrun Lovers Ask: Why Pay to Run a 5K?", "keywords": " 5k, bar code, fitness, free, jogging,more on fitness, no charge, no fee, online,parkrun, running,political,general news,physical fitness,health,living,lifestyle"}, {"content": "PAUL GIGOT       : Welcome to the Journal Editorial Report. I\u2019m Paul Gigot.The       Trump       administration is weighing options for its response to North Korea\u2019s military action after the rogue nation launched an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching Alaska.United Nations Ambassador       Nikki Haley       says the United States is also focusing on any nation that works with the North.U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY: In order to move North Korea off its military escalation, we must do more. We will not look exclusively at North Korea. We will look at any country that chooses to do business with this outlaw regime. We will not have patience for stalling or talking our way down to a watered-down resolution.GIGOT:       John Bolton       is a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a FOX News contributor.Ambassador, welcome back. Good to see you.JOHN BOLTON: Glad to be with you.GIGOT: Let\u2019s talk about North Korea. You have written this week that you think relying on China to help is a fool\u2019s errand. Why?BOLTON: Right. I think the premise of efforts both to negotiate with and pressure North Korea over the years have been grounded on the notion that you could change the behavior of the regime. And adding pressure to China to increase their pressure on North Korea to change North Korean behavior falls for the same reason. The North Koreans see a deliverable nuclear weapons capability as essential to regime survival, the ability to project power and, quite frankly, to sell or rent that technology to countries like Iran and even terrorist groups.GIGOT: Right, but China is basically North Korea\u2019s patron. I mean, if China weren\u2019t assisting in doing business and buying its minerals and buying its coal and selling it, you know, goods and needs, North Korea could not survive. So why not put pressure on China to say, look, this is not your national interest here. You don\u2019t want a nuclear North Korea on your border. That is not helping you.BOLTON: China\u2019s economic connection to North Korea is unquestionably essential to the North\u2019s regime survival. That is why my approach would be to convince China it\u2019s in their interest to merge the two Koreas to reunite them.But consider the arguments of that putting pressure on China to put pressure on North Korea. We are going to name a few Chinese banks, individuals. These pinprick sanctions never work because once you name the A, B, C Corporation to sanction it, amazingly, the X, Y and Z Corporation springs up to do business. So if you want to put pressure on China you have got to put big pressure on a big economy. Are we willing to cut off access to the American market to all Chinese banks to get their attention? That is where the idea breaks down.GIGOT: You think that you have to be that extensive in your sanctions to be able to really put pressure on China.But I\u2019ll say this. It looks to me like maybe Donald Trump could be willing to do that. He has obviously raised objections to Chinese trade and the trade deficit that we have with China. They are talking now about, at least beginning with tariffs on steel as early as next week, Chinese steel. What do you think -- how effective would that kind of economic pressure be on China?BOLTON: I don\u2019t think it would be terribly effective as regards North Korea. I could see a Trump administration imposing those kinds of sanctions on China for purposes of trade negotiation leverage. I can easily see that. And I do think Donald Trump really, if you focus down on key issues for him, the nuclear weapons programs of North Korea and Iran are two issues very central to his administration. So I think he is fully prepared to be tougher than the Obama administration, the       George W. Bush       administration or the       Bill Clinton       administration. But the issue is how much pressure do you need to put on China? I don\u2019t think, when he listens to his economic advisors, it would be enough. That is why I think this premise that we are -- all of these actions are intended to change the behavior of the North Korean regime ultimately fail. I think you need to change the regime.GIGOT: All right. You need to change the regime. How do you do that?       Robert Joseph,        who was a colleague of yours in the Bush administration, talked about a comprehensive strategy aimed at precisely that. So you would ramp up the members of proliferation initiative. You stop them from selling goods or being able to get goods in for the nuclear program. You start to spread the real truth to the North Korean people from the south and elsewhere to try to maybe develop some opposition inside North Korea. And you really squeeze their cash flow. Although, it is harder to do that entirely because of China. What else would you need to do?BOLTON: Well, Bob\u2019s right. I would do all that. But what you need to do fundamentally is persuade China. Contrary to the policy that they pursued for many years, that it is in their best interest ultimately to reunite the two Koreas and eliminate the North Korean nuclear weapons program. The Chinese say they don\u2019t want North Korea with nuclear weapons. Why? Not because they are a potential target, but because, ultimately, they fear Japan will get nuclear weapons. And that is a real threat to China.GIGOT: But then if China does not come around and see it that way, then you have to basic -- you have to do something as radical as saying, you know what, tell Japan maybe you do need your own nuclear deterrent?BOLTON: I do not believe that is the way to go. I think that would simply encourage a much wider nuclear arms race worldwide. I think it really is \u2014in China today, there is a debate among the older leadership and the younger leadership. Those are relative terms in China. The younger Chinese leaders, I think, by and large, see North Korea as a pretty ugly piece of baggage. There is a way to make a deal here. The Chinese historically have feared American troops on the river. We do not want to be on the river. We want to get the southern tip of the peninsula.And here is the main point to China I think. At some stage, North Korea will be threatening enough that an American president will really have to consider the use of military force. And if that happens, there could be chaos on the peninsula. That has to be to China\u2019s disadvantage. So, China, you can do this the easy way or you can it the hard way.GIGOT: But then you have to be able to show that you are willing to use military force, or otherwise, it will be -- we will end up with acquiescing to the North Korean nuclear threat.BOLTON: That is right. And, look, if you read the media today, some academic publications in this country, people are already being prepared to accept a nuclear North Korea. I will not accept a nuclear North Korea. I understand the risk to military force. I understand the danger to the South Korean peninsula. But Donald Trump is not president of South Korea. He is president of the United States. And I am not willing to risk an erratic Communist dictatorship with nuclear weapons threatening our civilians or civilians in other countries in the hopes that they won\u2019t lose their way.GIGOT: OK, thank you, Ambassador.Ahead, we dig deeper into the diplomacy surrounding the North Korea troubles. What can the president do and what roles will his adversaries and allies play? Our panel joins us, next.GIGOT: President Trump putting pressure on China to pull back its economic partnership with North Korea. The president tweeting, quote, \u201cTrade between China and North Korea grew almost 40 percent in the first quarter. So much for China working with us. But we had to give it a try!\u201dSo it is there room for negotiation?Let\u2019s ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor,       Dan Henninger      ; editorial board member,       Mary Kissel      ; and columnist,       Bill McGurn.So, Dan, you heard Ambassador Bolton. Do you share his urgency here and what do you think Trump will do?DAN       HENNINGER      : I do share his urgency, Paul. But, you know, the question is, how have we arrived at this point of urgency? I mean, you know, back during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, when we had that nuclear standoff, there was a lot of serious thinking around the idea about deterrence, nuclear deterrence.GIGOT: Right.HENNINGER: I\u2019m afraid that after the Cold War ended, we stopped thinking about that subject. And we have gone through several presidencies watching North Korea build its nuclear capability without any serious thought about how we would deter it. And as John Bolton was suggesting, it is not just North Korea. The nuclear genie is out of the bottle. Iran now, almost assuredly, is pursuing nuclear capabilities. There is the possibility that terrorists could get their hands on a small nuclear weapon. And I think that the time has come to start recommissioning the sort of people who can think about gradually deterring this sort of thing u sing convention weapons, maybe even tactical nuclear weapons. But you run the risk here\u2014GIGOT: Wait a minute, Dan. Are you saying that as a first strike or just as a deterrent in the Korean peninsula?HENNINGER: I\u2019m saying\u2014I\u2019m saying put everything on the table. I\u2019m not going to sit here and say we should do it first strike against North Korea. But I think he should think about doing a first strike and try to game out how that would work.GIGOT: So, Mary, you lived, worked in Asia. You heard John Bolton say that he did not think that we should pressure China, but more persuade them that a nuclear North Korea is not in their interest. Do you think -- do you see China coming around to that point of view?MARY KISSEL: I think that is a very difficult thing to achieve unless you exert the kind of pressure that Ambassador Bolton talked about, truly hurting China\u2019s economy, putting sanctions on their five biggest banks, putting potentially trade restrictions on them. And the question is, is the Trump administration\u2014GIGOT: That would hurt us.KISSEL: Yes, exactly. Is the Trump administration willing to exert that kind of damage on the U.S. economy? Look, Paul, there are not good options here. That might very well be a better option than the kind of first strike that Dan talked about.GIGOT: Right.Bill, I mean, you worked in Asia as well. You\u2019ve seen China. I\u2019ve been to I don\u2019t know how many meetings with these diplomats where you talk to them and you make the point about this not being, a nuclear North Korea, not in their interest and they always say, no, no, we can\u2019t have chaos there. You know, we cannot have a unified peninsula because it will be terrible. Perhaps China really wants us out of Northeast Asia and maybe they think that North Korea is the way to get us out.BILL MCGURN: China, for all of its growth in the global economy, has never been a leader in the way we have been hoping, to be a force for stability and so forth. Look, I think all of these things have to be on the table. It is not either/or. It is not pressure to the banks or military strength. We have to be for all of them. I would add -GIGOT: You would put even tariffs on China?MCGURN: I don\u2019t know. I am actually more inclined -- I would like to revoke the student visas for the children of the Chinese Communist Party. You know that leader there, his daughter went to Harvard. That is somethingGIGOT: You would put a lot of American colleges out of business!MCGUR N: But we are talking about an ICBM that could reach Seattle or Chicago. And we have to communicate that we are serious.Look, North Korea has always been a problem. In 1950,       Dean Atchison       gave a speech basically saying it is outside our perimeter --GIGOT: Security perimeter.MCGURN: Six months later, you know, North Korea invaded. And 67 years later, we are now being threatened with missiles. It is a serious problem.And in addition to the nuclear problem that we have, we have a second problem. Kim is a guy, he is akin to the suicide bomber, willing to blow himself up in the process. That gives him, unfortunately, a lot of leverage. Because almost any real choice we pick, whether it\u2019s pressure on China or North Korea has pain or death on the other side.GIGOT: Dan, what about this idea that is picking up steam that the ambassador mentioned? I have seen even somebody like       Charles Krauthammer       suggest that maybe we are moving towards acquiescence here. Look, you\u2019ve got a weapon, OK, it\u2019s a fait accompli. The price of forcing you to get rid of it is too great. But if you ever decide to use it, you will be destroyed. That kind of deterrence from the Cold War.HENNINGER: Yeah, that\u2019s right. It seems to be that\u2019s just unacceptable. And again, I point out the possibility of the Iranians getting nuclear capability. Now, if Iran were to, say, get close to what North Korea is able to do\u2014and they do have a very sophisticated missile program\u2014does anyone think that the Israelis are going to sit there and simply allow a situation of acceptance to exist? It is inconceivable. So I think the idea that we could acquiesce at this point is simply giving up and that we need a lot more intelligent thinking about what we can do to deter getting to the point where we have no option, as I was suggesting, other than a first strike. You don\u2019t want to get to that point. But we need a strategy now.GIGOT: Quickly, Mary?KISSEL: I think it\u2019s also important to understand what North Korea wants. North Korea wants to conquer South Korea. They want unilateral disarmament in the south and they want reunification on their terms. They think they are racially superior to the South Koreans. This is their goal, a unification of the peninsula on their terms. That\u2019s something we need also to think about.GIGOT: All right. Thank you all.When we come back, Congress sets its eye on a tax bill as health care stalls in the Senate. What this could mean for the larger prospect of tax reform.GIGOT: With the Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare stalling in the Senate, Congress is now focusing its attention on tax reform. Something Treasury Secretary       Steve Mnuchin       and House Speaker       Paul Ryan       say will get done before years end.TREASURY SECRETARY STEVE MNUCHIN: We are very committed to get tax reform done this year. It is one of the president\u2019s top priorities for economic growth. I think the people of America understand that, that we need economic growth and we are committed to doing that. I expect that health care, hopefully, will get done. But regardless, we are committed to getting tax reform done.HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN: We are going to get this done in 2017. But we will not wait for a path free of obstacles. Guess what? It doesn\u2019t exist! And we will not cast about for quick fixes and half measures. Transformational tax reform can be done and we are moving ahead full speed ahead.GIGOT: We are back with Daniel Henninger and Columnist Bill McGurn and Columnist       Kimberly Strassel.       Kim joins us as well.So, Kim, it looks like\u2014first, before we get to the separate tax reform, let\u2019s talk about the tax portion of the health care bill. It looks like Republicans in the Senate are blinking on the repeal of a particular portion of the ObamaCare taxes, the 3.8 percent surtax on investment income.KIM STRASSEL      : Right. Running instead of blinking.You have guys like Tennessee Senator       Bob Corker       who have already come out and said, look, I just think it is bad optics to be giving a tax break to the wealthiest in the country while we are cutting Medicaid for the poor. Of course, the problem here is that they said that they were going to repeal all the taxes.GIGOT: Yeah, I don\u2019t remember him saying only some of the taxes we\u2019ll repeal.STRASSEL: And this is considered one of the monster bad taxes because, of course, it is tax on investment income. So it is particularly bad.GIGOT: Now tell me what that means. It\u2019s capital gains. It\u2019s dividends. It\u2019s interest income from your bank account, for example. And it hits couples at $250,000 worth of income. Now, a lot of people think that is a lot of money. I can tell you, for a two-income family in a lot of places, it isn\u2019t.STRASSEL: Yes. For many people, this is a tax on the solidly middle class. And what you already seeing, though, I mean, this could be something actually derails the bill. I mean, the discussion.GIGOT: How so?STRASSEL: Well\u2014GIGOT: Because the Corkers and so on, if they say take it out, then some conservatives might block?STRASSEL: Right. Because the moderates have been demanding, demanding, demanding. They wanted money for opioid addiction and they wanted more generosity in the Medicaid program, but this is a bridge too far. You had about 40 conservative groups come out this week, send a letter to Senator       Orrin Hatch,        who runs the Finance Committee, saying, no, this cannot happen.GIGOT: Bill?MCGURN: I agree. I think the Republicans have made a mistake from the beginning, which is not\u2014GIGOT: Only one?MCGURN: Well, on this, it leaves them vulnerable to the same you\u2019re giving breaks to the wealthy and you\u2019re hurting the poor. I think the big mistake they have made is not explaining what we want to replace Medicaid. You know, we want to give people a better deal. We don\u2019t want to return it to the pre-ObamaCare status. We want to make it better. And we have failed to do that, to say why this isn\u2019t working for you. I mean, I think that -- we would see it later with the governors having flexibility to improve the program and so forth. But I think that has left them hostage because you see a slashing on one part and giving breaks to the other and it just fuels a very debilitating conversation.GIGOT: OK, but, Dan, on the politics of this and the optics, if Republicans are basically routed on the class war argument, in this context, then do they think that they will get, oh, well, we\u2019ll do it in tax reform, the Democrats are going to make the same argument!GIGOT: I mean, if you lose on this, what makes you think that you will win on the other one?HENNINGER: It is very difficult to see how they would win on the other one, Paul, especially since they are making the Democrats\u2019 arguments for them. Let\u2019s face it, these Republicans moderates are talking like Democrats, right? You raise taxes on the wealthy, or at least these people with upper incomes to pay for other programs. That is what they did with the 3.8 percent tax originally. The idea that it is a tax cut for the rich simply jumps over the fact that when ObamaCare was passed they slapped this capital gains tax on people making $250,000 to pay for it. That same argument, just as you\u2019re suggesting, will roll forward into tax reform when the Republicans start talking about cutting the corporate income tax or going to immediate expensing for new investments.GIGOT: Right.HENNINGER: They will be vulnerable again.MCGURN: Paul, I would say this is a role for the president, too. He\u2019s been absent on this in the health care bill. If President Trump had given an Oval Office address and explained what we are trying to do on Medicaid, to counter the Democratic claims, I think that would have gone a long way on how we are fixing it. I think he would have the same credibility as a businessman to give that address on, say, corporate tax cuts, to say, this is a way to make us more competitive and not give companies an incentive to go relocate in Ireland and so forth. But he hasn\u2019t used that. I mean, he\u2019s gone to rallies but he is not using on behalf of the two most important pieces of legislation.GIGOT: But, realistically, Kim, I mean, this president\u2014I mean, I agree totally with Bill\u2014he doesn\u2019t give speeches like that.STRASSEL: No, he doesn\u2019t. But I think the Republicans also need to understand, too, what credit do they get if they actually are going to go down this route? Is not as if, suddenly, Democrats will say, oh, yes, this is a good health care bill.GIGOT: If they were to abandon\u2014STRASSEL: If they were to abandon this and raise taxes, or even double the double the Medicare tax, at least they would get credit.GIGOT: No, they might before it is over!Still ahead, where the White House stands with the Kremlin following the highly anticipated meeting between President Trump and       Vladimir Putin.GIGOT: President Trump meeting the Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time, face to face, at the G-20 meeting in Germany. The president had this message for Putin before the sit-down.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We urge Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere and its support for hostile regimes, including Syria and Iran. And to, instead, join the community of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and in defense of civilization itself.GIGOT: We are back with Columnist Bill McGurn, Editorial Board Member Mary Kissel, and Dan HenningerSo, Dan, these details about these events tend to dribble out in time. And we do not know exactly what happened. Two hours, 16 minutes. Long meeting. What you think the most important thing we should be watching for is?HENNINGER: I think probably the most important thing is the atmospherics, the relationship between Donald Trump and Putin, because, you know, Vladimir Putin, a hard-nosed former KGB official, and he will be taking Donald Trump\u2019s measure in this. He\u2019ll be sizing him up to see what he can get out of Trump in the future. They\u2019re not going to solve the world\u2019s problems here.Two things that Donald Trump mentioned, stop destabilizing Ukraine and stop supporting authoritarian regimes in Syria. I do not think that is going to happen anytime soon.In so far as the Russian military buildup on the Ukrainian border, and as Putin has a clear idea of what he wants to achieve in the Middle East. I think what he has done here is try and figure how much he is going to be able to get over time out of Donald Trump.GIGOT: And the atmospherics --you may think it is a small point, but the Russians wanted only two people in the room, Mary. They wanted       Lavrov,        the foreign minister, and Putin with Trump and       Rex Tillerson.       Where is       H.R. McMaster,        the national security advisor? Russians likes small meetings.KISSEL: Yes. Or       Fiona Hill,        another Russia expert in the Trump administration. Look, it is savvy of Putin. When he sits down next to Donald Trump, looking like a world leader, acting like somebody who can, quote, unquote, \u201csolve problems with the U.S. president,\u201d that is a propaganda victory --GIGOT: For Putin, back home.KISSEL:\u2014for Putin, back home. And look, at the end of the day, Putin is great at solving problems that he himself created. Let\u2019s not forget what he did in Syria, bombing the U.S.-backed forces, carpet bombing civilians. He wants a port on the Mediterranean. He is propping up Assad. This is not a guy who you can trust in Syria to help solve anything.GIGOT: What you think of the atmospherics, Bill? Trump didn\u2019t stand up to him like       Emmanuel Macron,        the French president, who dressed him down before he met him and said, look, you shouldn\u2019t interfere with our elections. I wish, as an American, that I had heard our president dress Vladimir Putin down.MCGURN: Yes. I don\u2019t know. Look, the reality is the policy was decided before the meeting. The meeting is sort of the show, right? President Trump knew the shape of this deal.GIGOT: You are talking about the Syrian cease-fire that has been announced in southwest Syria\u2014MCGURN: Right.GIGOT:\u2014which is a modest deal, at most. It is a very small portion of Syria.MCGURN: What I\u2019m saying is the meetings, I don\u2019t think they matter too much. I think\u2014GIGOT: You don\u2019t?MCGURN: No. I think that reality is what the policy is. Macron\u2014let\u2019s look at what French policy is.MCGURN: If French policy is serious, we\u2019ll take France seriously. I think the key is, this is a legacy of       Barack Obama.       The Russians have military foothold in the Middle East. They\u2019re not going to give it up for any deal going on. I think what we have to change the dynamic, the way to pressure them is to look for other places. We tend to deal with these things discreetly, North Korea, Ukraine, Syria. The bad guys are watching all of that. I think Donald Trump has to be serious about what he said in Poland. And he has to change the dynamics so that, instead of saying, how will Vladimir Putin react, it should be how will Donald Trump react?GIGOT: Here\u2019s how you get Putin\u2019s attention on Syria\u2014I mean, on Ukraine, Mary. You sell lethal weapons to the Ukrainians.KISSEL: Absolutely. And you keep the sanctions on. And you keep American energy pipes open and you start shipping LNG to Europe. That\u2019s\u2014GIGOT: And Donald Trump is doing that!KISSEL: And that\u2019s true, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. Look, I agree with Bill that Trump inherited a certain reality on the ground in Syria. Where I differ a little bit is you don\u2019t want to legitimize Russia\u2019s role in that conflict. We don\u2019t need to accept that Russia is going to help set our foreign policy when it comes to Assad. I think I\u2019m a bit more hawkish here than my colleagues.MCGURN: Well, I\u2019m more hawkish. I want policy. Secretary       Mattis       said we don\u2019t deal in red lines, we deal with reality. Let\u2019s see what the policy is. I think, frankly, the press goes too crazy over these meetings. This is what the press covers.GIGOT: But don\u2019t you think that there is\u2014I mean, there is a personal dynamic here. And Putin is an old, canny KGB guy. He\u2019s going to look at Donald Trump and say, can I take him? He looked of Barack Obama, and we know from people who had talked to Putin about Obama, he had contempt for Obama.HENNINGER: Well\u2014GIGOT: And he rolled over him.HENNINGER: That is true. But, you know, sure, and Trump has to stand his ground. But he\u2019s got some pretty good people. Rex Tillerson understands Vladimir Putin. He has done business with him. He knows how ruthless he is. And he is got McMaster. I think they\u2019ve put in policies in place that are sending a signal to Putin.To follow up on this liquified natural gas point, last month, there was a huge shipment of LNG from Louisiana to the Polish port on the Baltic Sea. The       Pols      \u2014and then in that speech that Trump gave, he talked specifically about Poland getting alternative sources of energy that would not make them rely\u2014reliant on one supplier, meaning Russia. Putin understood that because that was gas that they had been selling\u2014MCGURN:\u2014selling missiles to Poland, too.GIGOT: Poland will\u2014MCGURN: Look, I think Vladimir Putin is going to be watching North Korea. Secretary Mattis said it\u2019s our biggest danger point, however, he has characterized it. And he\u2019s going to see, is Donald Trump serious about\u2014GIGOT: Yes, but Putin did not help on that front.MCGURN: Of course not!MCGURN: He\u2019s the bad guy. He is on the other side.GIGOT: He joined with the Chinese to say, oh, why don\u2019t you guys stop\u2014MCGURN: My point is that, that is where he is going to take the measure of Donald Trump. Not just meeting him in person but seeing\u2014you know, you go back to\u2014I think you mentioned       Khrushchev       and Kennedy. Kennedy blinked almost everywhere in the world, whether it was Laos, Berlin, Cuba. He blinked!KISSSEL: Yes. That is an important point. But how do you establish or reestablish, rather, reinforce U.S. deterrence after these past eight years? You see Trump doing that in the south, trying to see more freedom of navigation operation. You saw him bombing the chemical factory, chemical - look, the airport used to launch chemical weapons in Syria. But there will have to be a lot more than that.GIGOT: And Article V. In that Warsaw speech, Trump said\u2014KISSEL: Exactly.GIGOT:\u2014we\u2019ll stand up for that, which means NATO, if one is attacked, we\u2019re all attacked.All right. Still ahead, one group of immigrants facing deportation here in the U.S. could be a target of ISIS if they are sent back to their homeland. We look at the fate of Iraqi Christians under close watch by the feds.GIGOT: While much of the president\u2019s immigration policy has put the focus on illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America, another group of people facing deportation are at risk of death if they are sent back to their homeland. Fourteen hundred Iraqi Christians, some of them in the Detroit area, were recently detained by immigration agents. Their status is now in legal limbo.DETAINED IRAQI IMMIGRANT: I have been here since 8:00 a.m. with a paid attorney and everything. Nobody is giving me answers.How can you take my brother, these families to Iraq? None of them speak the language? And they will kill the Christians. They will kill our people!GIGOT: Joining me now,       Jillian Melchior.       Jillian will join the Wall Street Journal this coming week as an editorial page writer.Welcome to the program\u2014JILLIAN MELCHIOR: Thank youGIGOT:\u2014and to the Journal.So, Jillian, what is going on with these Christians and why are they at deportation risk?MELCHIOR: In June, there was an immigration sweep in Detroit. It ended up catching a lot of Iraqi Christians who were living there. And what this really dates back to is, for years, Iraq wouldn\u2019t take people back. It wouldn\u2019t allow you to deport them. Under Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban, that changed. Iraq agreed to take them back. So you have people who committed petty crimes, in some cases, decades ago. Have built lives, have built families, who are now eligible for deportation back to Iraq.GIGOT: Now was this immigration sweep focused only on people with criminal records?MELCHIOR: It was. It was.GIGOT: OK. So, but what kind of crimes are we talking about? I think the average viewer might say, well, wait a minute, you don\u2019t have a right to stay here if you\u2019re not a citizen and you commit a crime.MELCHIOR: It kind of runs the gamut. So on one extreme end, you\u2019ve got the head of a mafia, someone that had a murder conviction. On the opposite extreme, you have people who served probation for drug charges but have not committed crimes since. You have people that have committed misdemeanor fraud.GIGOT: Even misdemeanors?MELCHIOR: Even misdemeanors. What this means is you can come to the United States legally, but once you commit that crime, your immigration status is eligible for deportation. In a lot of cases, they had these decades since the crime occurred, have not committed repeat crimes, but they are now eligible for deportation.GIGOT: But otherwise, they have green cards. They have visas. They\u2019re legal\u2014these people are not illegal immigrants. These are people here legally.MELCHIOR: They came here legally. They\u2019re status is eligible for deportation now, which is kind of a legal gray area.GIGOT: OK. And under U.S. immigration law, if you commit a crime and you have that status, even if you have legal status but you\u2019re not a citizen, then you are subject to deportation.MELCHIOR: Yes. And this is where it gets complicated, I think, for both progressives and the Trump administration. So because these are Iraqi Christians, if they are sent back, they will face persecution. You\u2019ve seen       Mike Pence       saying, for instance, that Christians are subject to genocide in Iraq.GIGOT: In Iraq? Remember, these are\u2014they\u2019re not going back to Syria. Iraq has a functioning government. It has police and so on. But you\u2019re still saying the record is they will face persecution in Iraq?MELCHIOR: Yes. And if you look at what happened to the Christian community there in the last 15 years, it was 1.5 million in 2003. Four- fifths of them have left. So the U.S. government has acknowledged that as a genocide. They view that threat as very real. There is also concern about where in Iraq they will be sent back to, places like Irbil would be less insecure for them.GIGOT: Also, the Kurdish\u2014GIGOT:\u2014the Kurdish territory.MELCHIOR: Exactly. Places like Baghdad, that would be extraordinarily dangerous.GIGOT: OK, so what is the legal recourse now? And the Trump administration said\u2014Donald Trump has said that he pays particular attention to persecuted Christians in the Middle East. Does he have to step up and do something? Can he do something?MELCHIOR: It\u2019s very tricky. Basically, the burden of proof is on the immigrants. They have three real options. They can apply for relief under the Convention of Torture at the U.N. They can look for a pardon for the original crime, either from the president or from the governor. Or they can argue that this is going to pose extreme hardship to their citizens, spouse or children. All of those are very difficult to prove. And there is also a jurisdictional question. So you have the Eastern District of Michigan saying, we\u2019re not even sure if we can answer this. It might have to be handled administratively. It is very complex right now.GIGOT: And it almost does suggest that, given the challenge that these immigrants have, the government in the United States is going to have to say, you know what, we do think you will face persecution under the Geneva Convention on Torture and, therefore, we are going to make a special dispensation here. Is that, ultimately, what you think should happen?MELCHIOR: It is. But I think it is a tricky one for progressives because they positioned themselves as the main defender of the immigrants. What this brings\u2014MELCHIOR:\u2014is a religious question. In this case, the persecution is explicitly because of religion. But if you apply religion here, why not with the travel ban? Why not with prioritizing Christians for refugee status over Muslims from Iraq? It opens up a lot of questions both for the administration and for its progressive opponents.GIGOT: But there is a special problem for Christians in the Middle East.MELCHIOR: Absolutely.GIGOT: You can argue also there is a problem in other places, so you might\u2014I see what you mean. It is a slippery slope argument that you would have to allow in a lot more people. What do you think will happen?MELCHIOR: It is up for grabs right now. I think this is a case that is very politically charged and emotionally charged. I think, uniquely, American\u2019s have sympathy for Iraqi Christians. I think that may put some pressure on the administration.GIGOT: All right. Thank you, Jillian.MELCHIOR: Thank you.GIGOT: When we come back, the life of a baby with a deadly genetic disorder in the hands of U.K. courts. But now the effort is on to meet his parents\u2019 wishes to get their son to the United States for treatment.GIGOT: A baby with a rare genetic condition is in a fight for his life and it has caught the attention of President Trump and       Pope Francis.       10-month- old       Charlie Gard       suffers from Mitochondrial Depletion Syndrome, which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. Charlie\u2019s parents want to take him to the United States for experimental treatment. But the British courts are refusing, ruling his doctors in the U.K. should take him off life support and that Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity.We are back with Dan Henninger, Kimberly Strassel and Bill McGurn.A terrible case, Bill. but sometimes they eliminate moral issues.MCGURN: Yes. This is monstrous, this case, because it is not a case of resources. The family has raised money. It wouldn\u2019t cost the state something to do this.GIGOT: To bring him home.MCGURN: To bring him. The wording of the European court about that the parents have rights, overriding control is vested in the court, exercising it\u2019s independent and objective background. I mean, this is just chilling. And this is what it comes down to when you have a government-run health care. These questions come down to not what is to be done. I don\u2019t know what treatment the child should get. But who gets to make that decision?GIGOT: I don\u2019t understand. Why won\u2019t they let him go home, first of all? Even from the hospital, if the parents want him to. They won\u2019t even do that. And then, if it is not the states money, if it is money that the parents have raised, what is the argument for not letting them try some experimental the treatment in the United States?STRASSEL: The argument is\u2014and I think this what Bill was saying is so scary\u2014is that we control the state of this child. It\u2019s not really necessarily about the treatment or\u2014GIGOT: Is it power?STRASSEL: It is about control. Believe it or not, they actually appointed this hospital, and the state, a guardian for the baby, who has argued actively against the parents in the court system. So\u2014GIGOT: But I don\u2019t understand this. Do they fear a precedent, that somehow\u2014MCGURN: They sure do! They fear a precedent of having individuals control their own health care destiny. I think Kim is especially right. I mean, it\u2019s telling that they wouldn\u2019t even let the child go home to die in the arms of his parents.GIGOT: Explain this precedent. Are they saying that if Charlie Gard can go home, if his parents can say\u2014or sent him to the U.S. for treatment, that somehow other parents want to take terrible cases, people on life support, people with diseases that are probably not going to recover, we can\u2019t let\u2014everyone will want that kind of treatment then.STRASSEL: They\u2019re not outright saying that. Rather they are saying\u2014GIGOT: That would be inhumane!STRASSEL: And so the courts have been more careful than that. And in these decisions, what there are instead saying is it is better for Charlie to stay in the hospital. Better for Charlie to be taken off a ventilator. And we know what is best for Charlie. And that is what should scare people because it\u2019s setting precedent\u2014STRASSEL:\u2014the other way.GIGOT: I dare say, Dan, it sounds to me like maybe this court is a death panel.HENNINGER: Yes, they do sound like a death panel.But, look, Paul, there are a couple of things going on that are very European that Americans ought to be watching this. Euthanasia is much more popular in Europe than it is here. The Netherlands has an aggressive policy of euthanasia. And it applies generally to elderly people. But the argument is extend it as well to the mentally disabled and now to infants. I mean, it is a concept known as a duty to die.And I think the other thing that we have to be aware of is that most of Europe have these nationalized health care systems that are under tremendous economic pressure. And cost-containment is an idea that sits beneath a lot of these decisions not to treat people. Because it is just too expensive. And that is the sort of thing United\u2014you know, that we should be aware of right now as we debate whether we want to go towards more of that kind of national-provided health care.GIGOT: So this is the moral consequence, Dan, of single-payer health care? Government-run health care?HENNINGER: Absolutely, it is one of those consequences, because you get to the point where your cost, especially among elderly people, are so high that you say, these people have a duty to die because we simply cannot afford to pay for them. And especially with Charlie Gard, that will be expensive treatment. But still, in the United States, where we do have the best neonatal care in the world, we can experiment and try to find a way towards helping infants like that. But under the cost-containment environment, you simply don\u2019t do that, Paul.GIGOT: I guess they would respond and say, well, we don\u2019t\u2014he doesn\u2019t have much chance of recovery.MCGURN: Right.GIGOT: They say you are just wasting money.MCGURN: You\u2019re causing pain is what they are staying in this case. But, look, again, it gets back to who makes that decision. Do we really want a government bureaucracy making these decisions about our children? In this case, because they raised the money, as you say, we don\u2019t have the issue of someone claiming that the state should spend three or four million to keep someone alive at the end.STRASSEL: Also, allowing the state to make that decision allows them to make future ones. Right now, it is Charlie Gard and this very rare disease. But who is to say somewhere down the line it is not the state saying a child with Down\u2019s syndrome don\u2019t have quality of life? We shouldn\u2019t help them either. We do not want it. It is terrifying.GIGOT: All right. Thank you all.We have to take one more break. When we come back, \u201cHits & Misses\u201d of the week.GIGOT: Time now for our \u201cHits & Misses\u201d of the week.Dan, first to you.HENNINGER: I\u2019m giving a miss to electric cars, Paul. I mean, we all know how electric cars are supposed to be so desirable for saving the planet that they are sold with huge tax breaks for buyers. Well, apparently, that generosity doesn\u2019t quite extend to saving the roads. Because a lot of states like California and Michigan are now imposing fees on electric cars, EVB\u2019s, to pay for the repair of roads and bridges. At least 13 states have these EVB\u2019s now. Obviously, what the state giveth with one hand, it taketh away with the other.GIGOT: Always.Mary?KISSEL: I\u2019m going to give a miss to New York City Major       Bill de Blasio,        quite possibly, the most inept mayor in American today, taking us straight back to the \u201870s. I don\u2019t mean that in a good way. We found out this week that homelessness in New York is up almost 40 percent, the highest rate in more than 12 years. So while our trains are derailing and we\u2019ve got public urination in the streets and the homeless everywhere, where is Bill de Blasio? He\u2019s off to Germany to protest at the G-20.GIGOT: All right. I hope he stays there.Kim?STRASSEL: So, Paul, as many people have watched, Europe has had this growing problem with sexual assault at a lot of its concerts that it is having. This is nonetheless a miss to Sweden that decided the organizers of its biggest music festival, have decided that the way to answer this is to have a man-free concert series going forward. Men will simply not be allowed to attend. There has to be some better way of dealing with sexual assault, maybe policing or something, than banning half of humanity from listening to good music.GIGOT: All right.Bill?MCGURN: This may be a first, but a hit for Harvard Law School for announcing the new       Antonin Scalia       professorship of law. A spokesman for the Constantine (ph) family that endowed it said it was appropriate that his alma mater recognize him. Justice Scalia once said that he wrote for law students. So this is a great example of his legacy. The opinions are what really matters. But a tip of the hat to Harvard for honoring a son whose views weren\u2019t always popular on that campus.GIGOT: And the new dean of the Harvard Law School,       John Manning,        is actually a conservative, believe it or not. So give him credit for that.MCGURN: That\u2019s right.GIGOT: All right. Remember if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us, @jeronfnc.That\u2019s it for this week\u2019s show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to you for watching. I\u2019m Paul Gigot.

And he could face a strong challenge in a party-leadership election next year, these people say.A few months ago, Mr. Abe, one of the longest-serving global leaders, appeared to be in a strong position to lead Japan for several more years. But the accusations by rival politicians\u2014in particular, one involving alleged favoritism toward a school of veterinary medicine that a longtime friend of Mr. Abe wishes to open\u2014have undermined public trust.Mr. Abe has denied all allegations of favoritism and said earlier this year he would leave politics if proven to have helped friends.The toll of the accusations was apparent in public-opinion polls that media organizations released on Monday. The Yomiuri newspaper, Japan\u2019s largest-circulation daily, said 36% of respondents to a poll conducted over the weekend supported Mr. Abe\u2019s cabinet, down 13 percentage points from the previous poll in mid-June and the worst reading since Mr. Abe became prime minister for the second time at the end of 2012.Fifty-two percent of respondents didn\u2019t support the cabinet, and 68% agreed with the statement that Mr. Abe\u2019s cabinet had become arrogant because of its long period in power.An Asahi newspaper poll found that 74% of respondents didn\u2019t approve of how Mr. Abe has handled the veterinary-school issue\u2014a key factor, the newspaper said, in dragging down his overall poll ratings.Asked about the polls, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a news conference: \u201cWe take the recent fall in public support seriously.\u201dThe poll results followed a heavy defeat for his Liberal Democratic Party in July 2 elections for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly.Over the weekend, Mr. Abe indicated he would replace some unpopular cabinet ministers next month to bolster public support.Mr. Abe\u2019s public-approval ratings fell sharply in 2015 after the introduction of legislation expanding the role of the nation\u2019s military but soon recovered. The latest decline could be longer lasting, said Gerald Curtis, an expert in Japanese politics and professor emeritus at Columbia University.\u201cThis time it\u2019s about excessive concentration of power and the democratic process. It\u2019s much more serious,\u201d Mr. Curtis said.Last month, the government took the unusual step of skipping a vote in a parliamentary committee before passing antiterrorism legislation that has divided public opinion. Opposition parties slammed the move as a violation of the democratic process.The government said the law was an urgent priority to allow Japan to ratify a United Nations convention against organized crime and to prepare for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.In other controversies, Mr. Abe\u2019s defense minister,       Tomomi Inada,        said the nation\u2019s Self-Defense Forces and the Defense Ministry wanted voters to support Mr. Abe\u2019s party in the recent Tokyo election, a breach of the military tradition of political neutrality. She later retracted the remark.Mr. Abe, who is visiting Europe, told reporters on Sunday that he would \u201crejuvenate\u201d his cabinet, a move that is widely expected to include replacing the defense minister. He has also defended his economic accomplishments after the country recorded its longest growth period in 11 years and reached a free-trade deal with the European Union.On Monday, a former vice minister of education who has emerged as one of Mr. Abe\u2019s sharpest critics told parliament that top officials intervened to approve the permit for the school of veterinary medicine.\u201cThe decision was predetermined. The process was unclear and unfair,\u201d said the former vice minister, Kihei Maekawa, in a nationally televised parliamentary committee session.The prime minister has said that he had nothing to do with the decision to issue a permit to the veterinary college and that the process was fair.Mr. Abe\u2019s term as leader of the ruling party expires in September 2018. Traditionally, the ruling-party leader serves as prime minister.\u201cWe\u2019re not on Abe death watch yet, but the odds of him winning another term without a major contest have fallen dramatically,\u201d said Tobias Harris, a Japanese-politics analyst at Teneo Intelligence, the political-risk arm of the strategic consultancy Teneo.Write to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Japan\u2019s Abe Faces New Hurdle as Support Falls.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 10:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/japans-trust-in-abe-dwindles-as-scandals-beset-prime-minister-1499681405", "news_title": "Japan\u2019s Trust in Shinzo Abe Dwindles as Scandals Beset Prime Minister ", "keywords": "japan prime minister, japan scandal, shinzo abe, shinzo abe scandal, veterinary school japan, veterinary school scandal,Shinzo Abe,animal health,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "Everybody who\u2019s ever wrestled with the North Korean nuclear problem agrees on one thing: There are no good options for solving it.That bleak reality grows ever more apparent as North Korea fires off increasingly sophisticated missiles that could one day carry a nuclear weapon. So the pressing question is: Among all the imperfect options for dealing with North Korea, what strategy holds the best hope?Few are more qualified to offer an answer than       Robert Gates,        the most seasoned senior U.S. national-security official of the last half-century. He spent almost 27 years as an intelligence official, including a stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, worked in the White House for four presidents of both parties, and was defense secretary for both President       George W. Bush       and President       Barack Obama.As it happens, Mr. Gates has a plan, which he explained in an interview. It\u2019s worth listening to at a time when tensions are rising rapidly.The Gates proposal proceeds from several basic principles.\u00a0 First: There simply is no good pure military option for attacking North Korea. The sheer destruction and danger of an all-out war on the Korean Peninsula take that idea off the table.Second: \u201cChina is still the key no matter how you slice it,\u201d Mr. Gates says. As has been noted by every recent American administration, China is the one country with sufficient leverage over North Korea to make a difference.But Mr. Gates also says he agrees with President       Donald Trump       and his aides that it\u2019s time to \u201cdisrupt the status quo\u201d by trying a different approach with the Chinese.Which leads to the third principle: \u201cIt seems to me the need is for a comprehensive strategy you would lay out to the Chinese at a very high level, which would basically have both a diplomatic and a military component.\u201d In other words, make a deal with China before you deal with North Korea and its leader,       Kim Jong Un,        directly.Under the Gates approach, the U.S. would make China the following offer: Washington is prepared to recognize the North Korean regime and forswear a policy of regime change, as it did when resolving the Cuban missile crisis with the Soviet Union; is prepared to sign a peace treaty with North Korea; and would be prepared to consider some changes in the structure of military forces in South Korea.In return, the U.S. would demand hard limits on the North Korean nuclear and missile program, essentially freezing it in place, enforced by the international community and by China itself.\u201cI think you cannot get the North to give up their nuclear weapons,\u201d Mr. Gates says. \u201cKim sees them as vital to survival. But you may be able to get them to keep the delivery systems to very short range.\u201dIn addition, the U.S. would tell China that in any diplomatic solution the North Koreans would have to agree to invasive inspections that could insure a limited nuclear stockpile of no more than a dozen or two dozen nuclear weapons, as well as inspections to ensure they aren\u2019t developing more weapons or further capabilities for delivery.Crucially, the Chinese would be told that any diplomatic solution is one they would be expected to help enforce.On the flip side of that offer, Mr. Gates says, the U.S. would present a tougher alternative for China: \u201cIf that is not an outcome you can accept, we are going to take steps in Asia you hate.\u201dAbsent such an agreement, the U.S. would \u201cheavily populate Asia with missile defenses.\u201d That would include missile-defense buildups in South Korea, Japan and aboard additional American ships stationed in the Pacific. In addition, the U.S. would declare that it would shoot down \u201canything we think looks like a launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile\u201d from North Korea.In short, lacking a diplomatic solution, \u201cwhatever means we need to take to contain this regime, we will take.\u201dFor China, he says, the meaning of such a plan would be clear: \u201cAll those measures you will see as hostile to China. Your military response will cost you billions.\u201dIn reality, the U.S. would be threatening only to take military steps that would be inevitable in the absence of a negotiated solution in any case: \u201cIf option number one doesn\u2019t work, option number two is what you\u2019d need to do anyway.\u201dSecretary of State       Rex Tillerson       and Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       would present this proposal to the Chinese. If Beijing signed on, only then would direct talks with North Korea begin.Mr. Trump already has accepted the idea of a diplomatic approach when he said he would be \u201chonored\u201d to meet Mr. Kim \u201cunder the right circumstances.\u201d Mr. Gates offers a smarter way than that to get onto the diplomatic track.Write to Gerald F.

In this boom-and-bust industry, that leads to the obvious question: Are they too good?Global semiconductor revenue has doubled since the first dot-com era of the late 1990s. That is when PCs were flooding into every home, and every business was buying servers and wiring up for the internet. Those aren\u2019t big growth drivers now, but new industries have emerged to fill the gap: Cars and household appliances are packing in more chips than ever. Artificial intelligence is being built into big corporate networks. These sorts of capabilities require new processors and memory, in turn driving up sales of chips.That has put the chip industry in the strongest upswing in years. Global chip sales jumped nearly 23% in May to $31.9 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. That is the sixth consecutive month of double-digit gains\u2014the strongest sustained run in seven years. The association also projects full-year sales growth of 11.5%, which would also mark the highest growth rate since 2010. Profits are surging as well;             Samsung                   and             Micron Technology                   both recently reported record quarterly earnings, thanks mostly to strong prices on memory chips.But chips have been a cyclical business in the past, which feeds some understandable skepticism about how much longer the good times can last. Industry revenue has fallen in six of the past 20 years, according to SIA\u2019s data. So investors are nervous. Despite some gains in recent sessions, the PHLX Semiconductor Index is about 7% off its peak in the past month. That was after surging by 60% in value over the previous 12 months. The coming second-quarter earnings season will include forecasts for the latter half of the year, and any disappointment will likely send share prices down further. Still,             Credit Suisse                   opined Friday that at its current level the semiconductor index has priced in \u201ccyclical peak\u201d concerns.Those cyclical concerns may be overblown. The industry is enjoying several strong demand drivers that aren\u2019t short-term in nature. Autos in particular are in the midst of a strong push toward automation. Artificial intelligence also is still in its early days. And even mature markets like smartphones are creating fresh demand for specialized chips that improve network data connections and enable new capabilities like facial recognition and augmented reality.With demand strong, the biggest risk could be supply. Much of the current upswing in revenue is driven by strong prices in the volatile markets for DRAM and NAND flash memory. That could change, and an added risk may come from a handful of fabrication facilities under construction in China.With some exceptions\u2014like             Nvidia                   and             Advanced Micro Devices                  \u2014chips, buoyed by strong earnings, aren\u2019t that expensive. The PHLX Index averages around 14.8 times forward earnings now, unchanged from a year ago and a 32% discount to the Nasdaq Composite. The group has averaged a 21% discount over the past five years.With demand strong, the downside for the sector is limited. If investors believe the industry\u2019s wild swings are a thing of the past, they could give companies more credit for their healthy growth\u2014and feel confident in stacking up a few more chips.This column is part of a series on what is next for the booming semiconductor industry.Corrections & Amplifications   Global chip sales jumped nearly 23% in May to $31.9 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

It is the first among the scores of civil claims related to the scandal to allege wrongdoing by the U.S. Olympic Committee, and represents the first involvement of civil-rights attorney Gloria Allred.Allred, known for taking on high-profile sexual-abuse cases, filed the lawsuit along with John Manly, a plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer who is leading much of the litigation related to the scandal.The lawsuit was filed under pseudonyms for the gymnast\u2019s parents and seeks damages for negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and other civil claims. The parents argue that both USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee bear responsibility because the gymnast was under the care of those organizations at the time of the alleged assaults by physician Larry Nassar, and the parents believe those groups conspired to keep the alleged abuse secret in order to protect their reputations.Patrick Sandusky,        a spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Committee, declined to comment on the specific allegations because he said the organization had not been served with the lawsuit. \u201cThe allegations surrounding Nassar are astounding and heartbreaking,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe were not made aware of them until Nassar had already been reported to law enforcement. We will support any and all efforts to shine a light on the facts and to identify and address any systemic failures that contributed to the abuse that was suffered by these young women.\u201dA spokeswoman for USA Gymnastics said, \u201cThis is the first USA Gymnastics has heard of this lawsuit and declines to comment further.\u201d Allred declined to comment.While the suit does not reveal the gymnast\u2019s identity, the complaint says she competed nationally and internationally between 2009 and 2013, and that she was regularly \u201csubjected to sexual harassment, abuse and molestation\u201d by Nassar.Nassar, an osteopathic physician, served as a volunteer trainer and doctor for the U.S. national team for almost 30 years. The state of Michigan charged him in November with first-degree criminal sexual conduct stemming from allegations involving a family friend who was under 13 years old; the state attorney general has since added more than 20 additional counts related to other victims, including gymnasts.In December, federal prosecutors in Michigan charged Nassar with possession of child pornography. He is expected to plead guilty this week to the federal child-pornography counts, a person familiar with the matter said. The expected guilty plea was reported this weekend by the Detroit News.The child-pornography charges are unrelated to Nassar\u2019s work with gymnasts but he faces numerous civil lawsuits alleging that he sexually abused gymnasts and other athletes. Nassar has pleaded not guilty to the other pending charges against him and denied wrongdoing.Nassar\u2019s lawyer declined to comment on his client\u2019s reported guilty plea, and didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment Sunday about the gymnast\u2019s lawsuit.According to the June 30 lawsuit, the gymnast\u2019s parents, who live in California, first learned their daughter may have been sexually abused by Nassar in mid-July 2015. USA Gymnastics at that time was conducting a five-week internal investigation into a national team member\u2019s claim that Nassar was molesting her, The Wall Street Journal reported in February.During that investigation, USA Gymnastics spoke with several national team members, then referred the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation at the end of July 2015, the Journal reported.\u201cI think these parents feel an incredible sense of betrayal,\u201d Manly said of the lawsuit, adding that Nassar was often unsupervised when seeing gymnasts at U.S. Olympic Committee-sponsored events and at the Karolyi Ranch training center in Texas. \u201cYour daughter competes for her country on the national team and this horrific activity happens.\u201dThe parents faced a potential statute-of-limitations deadline, whereas their daughter has a longer time frame in which to file a claim, said Manly, who also represents the gymnast.USA Gymnastics is already facing three other lawsuits in California brought by former elite gymnasts, including a member of the bronze-medal winning 2000 Olympic women\u2019s team, a former national team member, and a member of the 2010 world team.All three gymnasts filed as Jane Does, but have since gone public on television and in congressional testimony, identifying themselves as Jamie Dantzscher, Jeanette Antolin and Mattie Larson.Court documents from those lawsuits show that plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have sought information from a number of other elite gymnasts, including members of the 2008, 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams.In depositions, top USA Gymnastics officials have declined to answer when asked whether the organization has made any confidential settlements with gymnasts, according to the court documents.USA Gymnastics is challenging the previously filed California litigation on jurisdictional grounds, pointing out that Nassar was a Michigan resident, and that the organization is Indiana-based and incorporated in Texas, court filings show. Manly says USA Gymnastics was a national organization that conducted substantial business in California, including hosting national and international meets there.The stakes in that fight are high. California is known as a relatively plaintiff-friendly state, where the statute of limitations runs well into victims\u2019 adulthood and courts are often willing to award multimillion-dollar damages.Write to Rebecca Davis O\u2019Brien at rebecca.obrien@wsj.com, Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com and Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 09:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-of-elite-gymnast-sue-u-s-olympic-committee-in-sex-abuse-claim-1499694624", "news_title": "Parents of Elite Gymnast Sue U.S. Olympic Committee in Sex-Abuse Claim", "keywords": "gloria allred,gymnastics,larry nassar,sex abuse gymnastics,usa gymnastics,USA Gymnastics,U.S. Olympic Committee,political,general news,crime,legal action,olympics,sex crimes,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump\u2019s       eldest son arranged a June 2016 meeting between top campaign aides and a Russian lawyer who has been linked to the Kremlin after being told she \u201cmight have information helpful to the campaign.\u201dIn a statement Sunday, Donald Trump Jr. said he didn\u2019t know the lawyer\u2019s name before the meeting, and said they were set up by an \u201cacquaintance\u201d from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant. The meeting, in New York City, was also attended by       Jared Kushner,        the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and       Paul Manafort,        President Trump\u2019s campaign chairman at the time. The younger Mr. Trump said he told Messrs. Kushner and Manafort \u201cnothing of the substance\u201d of the meeting beforehand.Mr. Manafort resigned about two months later amid reports of his connection to pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine. Investigators are currently examining whether Mr. Manafort\u2019s work for foreign interests violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act and related laws. Mr. Manafort\u2019s spokesman has said he is taking the \u201cappropriate steps\u201d to respond to guidance from federal authorities about his FARA disclosures.In the meeting, the lawyer,       Natalia Veselnitskaya,        \u201cstated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting [Hillary] Clinton,\u201d Mr. Trump Jr. said in his statement. \u201cHer statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.\u201d When Ms. Veselnitskaya then raised the issue of the Magnitsky Act, which placed sanctions on Russian human-rights abusers, Mr. Trump Jr. said he cut off the meeting.On Monday morning, Mr. Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter, \u201cObviously I\u2019m the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen.\u201dMs. Veselnitskaya couldn't be reached for comment.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.Revelations of the 2016 meeting arrived over the weekend as President Trump was returning to Washington after a G-20 summit meeting in Hamburg, where he met one-on-one with Russian President       Vladimir Putin.       In Sunday morning tweets, the U.S. president said he \u201cstrongly pressed\u201d the Russian leader twice about meddling in the U.S. election and that Mr. Putin \u201cvehemently denied it.\u201d But he also suggested the U.S. could \u201cwork with\u201d Russia on cybersecurity issues.Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of the meeting, saying he could have more strongly protested Russian meddling and that he appeared overly willing to look past Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the U.S. election. They also questioned Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that the U.S. could work with Russia on cybersecurity issues, saying it would only empower a regime that has hacked systems in the U.S.U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian hackers, who analysts say work for that country\u2019s military and intelligence apparatus, stole emails from the DNC, as well as another Democratic organization and the chairman of       Mrs. Clinton\u2019s       presidential campaign, as part of their effort to harm her candidacy and boost Mr. Trump. That finding was first publicly addressed in the fall of 2016.Investigators in Congress as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation are examining whether Russian money could have made its way into the U.S. election process, according to multiple officials with knowledge of the investigation. But whether those money flows took the form of laundered campaign contributions\u2014foreign parties cannot donate to U.S. politics campaigns\u2014or whether Russian funds were used in support of candidates is unclear.A person close to the Trump campaign recalled getting an email around the time of the meeting with the Russian attorney asking about the campaign\u2019s stance on the Magnitsky Act. The person could not recall if they responded to the email, or whether it was before or after the meeting took place.In a statement on Saturday about the meeting, Mr. Trump Jr. had made no mention of the promise of helpful information Ms. Veselnitskaya could provide, or of her statements about Russian campaign funds. Instead, he said the meeting \u201cprimarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government.\u201dThe Trump aides met with Ms. Veselnitskaya on June 9, about a month after Mr. Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination. The             New York Times                   first reported the meeting on Saturday.The president didn\u2019t become aware of the meeting with Ms. Veselnitskaya until recent weeks, according to a person familiar with the conversation.The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Mr. Putin ordered a campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor, and a special counsel appointed by the Justice Department earlier this year is investigating whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia in that effort. Mr. Trump has denied that there was any collusion and has said he doubts the intelligence community\u2019s assessment, saying earlier this week, \u201cNo one really knows for sure.\u201dBrian Fallon,        who served as press secretary for the Clinton campaign, said the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to take a meeting with a Russian individual who promised helpful campaign information raised further questions about potential collusion.Mr. Kushner disclosed the meeting with Ms. Veselnitskaya earlier this year in a required form to obtain a security clearance, according to a statement by his attorney,       Jamie Gorelick.      \u00a0Mr. Kushner initially filed a disclosure that didn\u2019t list any contacts with foreign government officials, but the next day submitted a supplemental disclosure saying that he had engaged in \u201cnumerous contacts with foreign officials.\u201dMr. Kushner has since submitted information about \u201cover 100 calls or meetings with representatives of more than 20 countries, most of which were during transition,\u201d Ms. Gorelick said.\u201cMr. Kushner has submitted additional updates and included, out of an abundance of caution, this meeting with a Russian person, which he briefly attended at the request of his brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr.,\u201d Ms. Gorelick said. \u201cAs Mr. Kushner has consistently stated, he is eager to cooperate and share what he knows.\u201dTwo previously disclosed meetings Mr. Kushner held with key Russians\u2014the head of a state-run bank that has faced U.S. sanctions and       Sergei Kislyak,        the Russian ambassador to the U.S.\u2014had already drawn the interest of agents conducting a counterintelligence investigation to determine the extent of those contacts. Mr. Kushner agreed earlier this year to speak to the Senate Intelligence Committee, becoming the first White House official to do so.Ms. Veselnitskaya counts among her clients state-owned companies and family members of top government officials and her husband previously served as deputy transportation minister of the Moscow region.As a lawyer, she has campaigned against the Magnitsky Act, which targets Russian human-rights abusers, and the Russian accountant for whom the measure was named.       Sergei Magnitsky       was jailed and died in prison after he uncovered evidence of a large tax-refund fraud.In a move seen as retaliation to that law, Mr. Putin in 2012 signed a law banning adoption of Russian children by American families.In postings on her social media accounts, Ms. Veselnitskaya appeared critical of former President       Barack Obama       and the Democratic Party. Last July, she shared an article posted by another page and highlighted the quote, \u201cLiberalism is a f\u2014ing mental disorder.\u201d She has also appeared to cheer some of Mr. Trump\u2019s top achievements, such as the confirmation earlier this year of       Neil Gorsuch,        Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court.\u2014Shane Harris contributed to this article.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Trump\u2019s Son Met With Russian About Campaign.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 09:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-jr-met-russian-lawyer-who-claimed-to-have-helpful-campaign-information-1499646830", "news_title": "Trump Jr. Met Russian Lawyer Who Claimed to Have Information on Hillary Clinton", "keywords": "donald trump jr., hillary clinton, russia ties, trump campaign,Donald Trump,Natalia Veselnitskaya,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi was in Mosul on Sunday to congratulate government forces in advance of declaring the victory over Islamic State in the mainly Sunni Muslim city. Here are a few things to know about the nearly nine-month battle to retake it from the militant fundamentalist group.Mosul was Islamic State\u2019s last major foothold in IraqThe all but certain defeat of Islamic State in Mosul is the biggest yet for Iraqi government forces and their allied militias, as well as the U.S.-led military coalition fighting the group in Iraq and Syria. Mosul is Iraq\u2019s second-largest city and had been Islamic State\u2019s biggest prize in Iraq, both an economic hub and a showcase for its rule. Between January 2015 and last month, it lost control of about 21,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria, according to             IHS Markit.Islamic State remains a viable threat in IraqIslamic State\u2019s loss of Mosul, which it took over more than three years ago, while significant, doesn\u2019t mean its demise in Iraq. While many of its fighters have been killed, it members and followers have dispersed across the region. As of last month, it still held sway over about 14,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria, or an area the size of Belgium, IHS Markit says.Mosul is a significant political victory for the Iraqi government and its two main allies, the U.S. and IranFor Washington, the defeat of Islamic State in Mosul vindicates the U.S. strategy of providing training and air, logistics and intelligence support to Iraqi government forces, and keeping, as much as possible, boots off the ground in Iraq. For Iran, the defeat puts it and its allied Iraqi Shiite militias a step closer to a land supply route linking Iran in the east and Lebanon in the west.The anti-Islamic State campaign in Iraq shifts to the west of MosulNext up for Iraqi government forces is Tal Afar, which has roughly one-third Mosul\u2019s prewar population of about 1.8 million people but poses an even greater threat to inflame sectarian tensions. Shiite militias allied with the government have surrounded the city and now want to lead the battle to take it, but the possibility for revenge attacks is high: ISIS has been blamed for mass killings of Shiites in Tal Afar. U.S.-backed government forces insist they, not the militias, must take the lead on the operation.Securing and stabilizing Mosul will take months and its reconstruction, yearsClearing recently liberated neighborhoods of booby traps and an unexploded ordnance is as a monumental task, one that must be completed before residents can return to their homes and humanitarian aid groups can get their work under way. And only with the end of the fighting will the magnitude of the damage to the city and the cost of reconstruction be determined.Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 09:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-things-to-know-about-the-battle-against-islamic-state-in-mosul-1499693879", "news_title": "Five Things to Know About the Battle Against Islamic State in Mosul", "keywords": "iraq,islamic state,mosul,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,terrorism"}, {"content": "The global bond rout deepened last week, spilling over into the equity markets.

MSFT 0.76%       on Monday unveiled a new bundled software offering that will leverage its dominant operating system and productivity applications to provide a boost to products that aren\u2019t as widely used.The move reflects an effort that       Satya Nadella       has pushed after he became chief executive a little more than three years ago to get Microsoft\u2019s disparate divisions to work more closely together. That approach, dubbed One Microsoft, was aimed at ending the internecine battles that sometimes slowed the software company as it competed in a variety of businesses.At its Inspire partner conference in Washington, Microsoft introduced a product for small and midsize businesses that combines Windows and Office with its security and mobile-device management software. The company also rebranded the bundle, which it began selling to its largest corporate customers two years ago, under the new Microsoft 365 banner.\u201cCulturally, we are changing the way we work,\u201d said       Kirk Koenigsbauer,        corporate vice president in Microsoft\u2019s Office division.The new approach is also reflected in Microsoft\u2019s sales-force reorganization last week, which led to thousands of layoffs. Microsoft is trying to reorient its sales staff to focus on specific markets, such as small business, rather than discrete products.The new bundle for small and midsize businesses, called Microsoft 365 Business, includes licenses for Windows 10 upgrades, a business version of Office 365, and security and management technology. Microsoft will roll out a preview version next month and expects it to be generally available in October for $20 per user, per month.The bundle will offer businesses discounts that could top 50%, compared with the cost of buying the products separately, Mr. Koenigsbauer said.Microsoft has been selling a version of the bundle to large businesses, called Secure Productive Enterprise, that will now be called Microsoft 365 Enterprise.Mr. Koenigsbauer said that product has recorded \u201ctriple-digit growth,\u201d though he declined to provide revenue data. \u201cIt\u2019s a substantial driver of our growth,\u201d he said.The combined software and new branding should simplify Microsoft\u2019s marketing efforts, providing clarity the company\u2019s business products often have lacked, said Alan Lepofsky, principal analyst with Constellation Research Inc.Moreover, tying products in markets where Microsoft isn\u2019t dominant, such as security software, to products in markets where it is, such as operating systems, will challenge niche rivals, Mr. Lepofsky said.\u201cMicrosoft would love to have that business over a third party,\u201d he said.The product bundle already has displaced a security-software maker at Fruit of the Loom Inc., said       Chris Krebs,        information chief at the apparel company. The company already had been using Windows 10 and Office 365, but in January switched to Secure Productive Enterprise.Microsoft \u201ctying all that together was critical to me,\u201d Mr. Krebs said.Write to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Bundled Software Boosts \u2018One\u2019 Plan.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/with-new-software-bundle-microsoft-furthers-nadellas-one-push-1499691600", "news_title": "With New Software Bundle, Microsoft Furthers Nadella\u2019s \u2018One\u2019 Push ", "keywords": "microsoft, microsoft 365 business, microsoft 365 enterprise, microsoft inspire conference,microsoft office, microsoft secure product enterprise , microsoft windows, satya nadella,Microsoft,MSFT,Kirk Koenigsbauer,Alan Lepofsky,Satya Nadella,Chris Krebs,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,computing,technology"}, {"content": "Samsonite International SA,        1910 -0.61%       the world\u2019s largest luggage maker by volume, is looking to double its market share in the next decade, by widening its product range, pushing into smart luggage, and focusing on bags designed for women.In an interview in London, Chief Executive       Ramesh Tainwala       said the company foresees an enormous opportunity to take market share from private label or unbranded players, which currently make up about 50% of the luggage market by volume. He estimates the market for luggage and everyday bags globally is growing at a steady 4% to 5% each year helped by population growth, longer living and travel having become more central as a leisure activity.Samsonite\u2019s retail unit filed for bankruptcy in 2009 after travel slumped following the global financial crisis and travelers opted for cheaper products. In 2015, the company launched cheaper suitcase brand Kamiliant in emerging markets, in a bid to protect itself from further macroeconomic instability and woo price-sensitive customers in emerging markets. It also recently put more muscle behind its lower-end American Tourister luggage, which starts at about $100.The company, which went public in 2011, has simultaneously pushed into more upscale turf, last year buying New-Jersey based Tumi Holdings Inc. for $1.8 billion, whose products are priced at $500 and above, which is higher than Samsonite\u2019s own-brand prices of $100-$300.Despite the extensions, Mr. Tainwala said Samsonite has decided to stay focused on its core business. The company in 2014 bought Speck, a U.S. designer of mobile phone cases for $85 million marking its first foray beyond luggage and bags. But Mr. Tainwala on Monday said his enthusiasm for the business\u2014which relies on the success of mobile phones and on different distribution channels to Samsonite\u2019s\u2014has cooled.\u201cIt\u2019s not controllable because you\u2019re dependent on the success of everyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now asking, do we need to stretch ourselves?\u201dThe company is putting more resources toward developing its online business, in April saying it had agreed to buy online bag seller eBags Inc. for $105 million. Online purchases currently make up about 9% of its sales.While about 35% of company\u2019s revenue current comes from every day bags, or ones that are used for work or school rather than travel, Mr. Tainwala is aiming for this to reach 50%, leaving Samsonite less open to the vagaries of macroeconomic disruption.On Friday, Samsonite launched a wireless bag tracking device under the Tumi brand for $200 after receiving approval from the U.S.\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration. The luggage industry has been slow to launch products incorporating new technology, which Mr. Tainwala blamed on safety concerns. \u201cIf you can talk to your luggage so can somebody else,\u201d he said citing worries of terrorists using tracking devices to blow up suitcases. To address this, the Tumi tracker automatically turns off as the plane accelerates and only turns back on upon landing.Currently 5.7 bags are lost per 1,000 passengers with the number forecast to rise with increasing travel, said Mr. Tainwala. Going forward he hopes to develop cheap microchips that can be embedded in every bag, and that work with airlines\u2019 software systems so baggage can be tracked by airlines as well as customers.Write to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 08:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsonite-aims-to-bag-more-market-share-1499690913", "news_title": "Samsonite Aims to Bag More Market Share", "keywords": "luggage,samsonite,Samsonite International,1910.HK,HK:1910,Ramesh Tainwala,marketing,markets,market share,branding,corporate,industrial news,generic products,consumer goods,leisure,travel goods"}, {"content": "As a wave of consolidation hits the shipping industry, investors may be wise to ride it.China\u2019s largest shipping company             Cosco Shipping Holdings,        601919 0.56%       along with one of the world\u2019s biggest port operators, offered $6.3 billion for Hong Kong-listed         Orient Overseas               (International) to become the world\u2019s third-largest container-shipping company.\u00a0The offer price came in at a juicy 31% premium to Friday\u2019s closing price and at a 40% premium to Orient\u2019s book value.The premium isn\u2019t just the classic case of a Chinese buyer overpaying. There are synergies: Orient does in fact bring with it a range of high-yielding, profitable routes to the U.S. and a sticky base of customers. That will complement Cosco\u2019s base of Chinese exporters and raise its market share of the global shipping industry to 12%. Orient\u2019s financing costs are lower too, so that should bring down Cosco\u2019s. The Chinese shipper also brought in             Shanghai International Port Group.Precedent transactions in the industry make the price look high. At 1.4 times last year\u2019s book value, it is the highest multiple in recent deals. But this deal comes at a pivotal time in the industry as the likes of             AP Moller Maersk                   and             Hapag-Lloyd                   are in the process of merging with other giants. Investors should put this in context: past averages and prices are coming off of a dismal time for the shipping industry. Now, trade is broadly better, with demand on routes from Asia to the U.S. and Europe growing between 4% and 6% so far this year. Traffic volumes are expected to grow 5% and 15% over the next two years too.\u00a0So while it is still far from good times in the industry there is less oversupply.It won\u2019t all be smooth-sailing though. The behemoth Chinese deal still has to wade through regulatory approvals. Given it is a Beijing-backed deal, hurdles at home will be limited, but agencies such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, recently turned off by Chinese deals, could take issue. Orient owns a container terminal in Long Beach, Calif.\u2014one of the busiest containers ports in the U.S.\u00a0It also owns a container terminal in Taiwan. A failed deal could cost $253 million.Nevertheless, investors rejoiced over the deal. Rival shippers\u2019 shares such as Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd got a bump. Cosco\u2019s Hong Kong-listed unit ended up 5.4%.

It did so even though it had negotiated a restructuring agreement with creditors that would have saved $2.2 billion in debt service that could have been used to invest in modernizing the utility.In a democratic, market economy that would be weird. But Puerto Rico is now run by a seven-member, unelected federal board under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or Promesa, passed by Congress last year. On June 27 that board unilaterally rejected the restructuring agreement, leading the company to declare bankruptcy.The board\u2019s takedown of the Prepa deal is part of its wider drive to excuse Puerto Rico from tough negotiations with creditors and instead give creditors a crew cut. An adviser to the Ad Hoc Group of General Obligation Bondholders of Puerto Rico told me in April they were close to a deal with the commonwealth in which each side would make concessions. But the oversight board came in at the 11th hour to stop negotiations and imposed a fiscal plan that leaves minimal funds for debt service.Behind these decisions is a belief that if the commonwealth can clear its balance sheets by giving creditors only a fraction of what they are owed, Puerto Rico\u2019s access to the capital markets will resume. Seriously.Advocates of empowering this Washington junta say bondholders are getting what they deserve for buying the triple-tax-exempt debt even though the island\u2019s fiscal picture was deteriorating. Yet even before Promesa, bondholders were on schedule to take losses. The difference is that under the shelter of federal intervention, the rule of law has been politicized and creditors have been stripped of their rights. Bondholders are crying foul, but the real losers are Puerto Ricans.Puerto Rico\u2019s constitution stipulates that general-obligation bondholders must be paid before San Juan uses its revenues for any other purpose. By leaving bondholders only the budgetary crumbs, the fiscal plan effectively green-lights the violation of the constitution. It also violates the Promesa requirement that the board approve a plan that \u201crespect[s] the relative lawful priorities or lawful liens, as may be applicable, in the constitution, other laws or agreements . . .\u201dPromesa also recognized the Prepa restructuring by expressly exempting any \u201cpreexisting voluntary agreement.\u201d Yet the board ignored this constraint on its power when it dissolved the agreement last month, as Assured Guaranty has noted in a complaint filed in federal district court in Puerto Rico on June 26.Four members of the oversight board now say they nixed the Prepa agreement because they have a plan to privatize the company and the restructuring deal would scare off investors.In a June 23 op-ed in the Puerto Rican daily El Nuevo D\u00eda, Stephen Spencer, financial adviser to the Prepa Bondholders Group\u2014whose members own some 40% of the company\u2019s bonds\u2014rejected the claim that the restructuring would mean the company could not attract private capital.Even if the board is right, it is hardly a justification to trample creditor rights or violate the Promesa law. Doing so increases legal uncertainty on the island and is unlikely to produce the desired result of faster growth through investment. Three years after Detroit declared bankruptcy, it is still not able to access the capital markets without the backing of the state of Michigan. Puerto Rico has no such backstop.The quid pro quo for bankruptcy was supposed to be fiscal discipline. But that\u2019s not happening, according to Ojel Rodr\u00edguez, a research analyst for the San Juan think tank Fundaci\u00f3n Libertad. In a March post co-authored with his colleague Andresen Blom, he said \u201cthe government has defined most of the budget as essential services, meaning that any serious restructuring of the island\u2019s finances amounts to basically reducing [debt service] . . . often directly in conflict with Promesa and the Puerto Rican Constitution.\u201d On Wednesday Mr. Rodr\u00edguez told me by email that rather than seriously cutting expenditures, the political class on the island is now \u201cpassing the buck to hard-pressed taxpayers.\u201dIn a June 13 letter to oversight board Chairman Jose B. Carri\u00f3n III, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas warned that the board\u2019s fiscal plan \u201ccreates a dangerous precedent that property and investor rights are open to interpretation in a fiscal crisis.\u201d Mr. Carri\u00f3n responded in a June 22 letter that the plan is the best alternative. In a telephone call last week Mr. Cotton told me that he remains concerned about the board\u2019s treatment of the rule of law.Bringing fiscal discipline to Puerto Rico will be politically costly. Stiff-arming creditors is more fun. But in an economy heavily dependent on access to capital markets, it\u2019s bound to produce more pain than gain.Write to Mary Anastasia O\u2019Grady at O\u2019Grady@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 08:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-ricos-broken-promesa-1499689839", "news_title": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Broken Promesa", "keywords": "plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,corporate restructuring,economic performance,indicators,bankruptcy figures,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,analyses,commentaries,opinions,electricity,gas utilities,utilities"}, {"content": "Zinc prices have moved sharply higher over the past month, spurred by tight supply amid tougher Chinese environmental regulations, and analysts say the metal could rise further despite signs of a rebound in mine output.The industrial metal ticked down 0.52% to $2,772 a metric ton in Monday morning trade in London, but was still up more than 9% than a month earlier.The shift in the zinc market follows a sharp contraction in output after an earlier glut sent prices tumbling, leading to shutdowns in production at many mines across the globe.At the same time, demand for zinc\u2014a lightweight, rustproof metal favored in the car and construction industries among others\u2014has remained steady, eating away at the excess inventory.Now, mines can\u2019t ramp up production quickly enough to meet the demand, which remains particularly strong in China, setting the stage for the sustained rally in prices.Even though some idle mines have restarted since zinc began its resurgence in early June, \u201cit looks as though prices will head even higher as this deficit will continue to bite,\u201d said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at             Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.Production ramp-ups in Cuba, Bolivia, Ireland and other places aren\u2019t enough to sway market forecasts for constrained supply, said Xiao Fu, commodity strategist at BOCI Global Commodities.Evidence that the zinc market remains tight is visible in the recent drop in inventories. The London Metal Exchange\u2019s on-warrant inventory figure which\u2014at 70,350 metric tons\u2014is at its lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2007. Similarly, while Shanghai stocks have risen 3.2% in the past week, those gains bring stocks off lows not seen in more than eight years.In China, the government\u2019s efforts to combat pollution have led to more stringent rules aimed at smaller miners and smelters in particular, a significant move for the zinc market considering China is responsible for roughly 40% of the world\u2019s supply, according to Vivienne Lloyd, a metals analyst at brokerage-house Macquarie.Zinc and lead are often mined together, and the mining process can result in lead and other heavy metals contaminating the water supply and environment.While aluminum and lead prices have also risen, zinc has outperformed other base metals so far this year, with the LME\u2019s benchmark zinc futures contract up 8% so far in 2017.Investors are accumulating long positions in the metal. As of close-of-business on July 5, bets that the metal\u2019s price would continue to rise had reached their highest level since November.\u201cJust because positioning is long, that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t go longer,\u201d said Alastair Munro, a broker at Marex Spectron.Write to David Hodari at David.Hodari@dowjones.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Zinc Surges as Supply Gets Tighter.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 08:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/zincs-in-the-pink-as-mine-supply-struggles-to-meet-demand-1499688611", "news_title": "Zinc Is in the Pink, as Mine Supply Struggles to Meet Demand ", "keywords": " aluminum, base metal prices, base metals, chinese environmental regulations,lead prices,zinc, zinc demand, zinc market, zinc prices,Alastair Munro,Vivienne Lloyd, Xiao Fu,Robin Bhar,commodity markets,metals markets,commodity,financial market news,lead markets,non-ferrous metals markets,zinc markets,metal ore mining,lead ore,zinc ore mining,basic materials,resources,mining,quarrying"}, {"content": "For world leaders, the accelerating nuclear threat from North Korea is near the top of the worry list. For investors, not so much.Investors have plowed money into North Korea\u2019s southern neighbor, resulting in unexpectedly stellar performances for South Korea\u2019s stock, bond and currency markets. Even the market for South Korea\u2019s credit default swaps, which act like insurance against bond defaults, remains calm compared with recent years.\u201cWhat surprises us is how the CDS market isn\u2019t really moving much despite geopolitical uncertainties. People are complacent,\u201d says       Jean-Charles Sambor,        deputy head of emerging-market debt at BNP Paribas Asset Management, with about $661 billion in assets under management. He said BNP is cautious on Korean dollar debt because it is expensive and that the CDS market is \u201cunderestimating risk.\u201dSouth Korea\u2019s benchmark stock index has surged to record highs this year, up 18%. Cash continues to pour into Korean equities and bonds, which analysts attribute to an improving economy and strong earnings. And while investors say geopolitics shouldn\u2019t be ignored, they are more focused on the positives, including double-digit export growth.North Korea test-launched its first-ever intercontinental ballistic missile last week, and U.S. President Donald Trump said he is considering \u201csome pretty severe things\u201d in response. But in a world where market volatility has nearly vanished, it caused hardly a ripple in financial markets.\u201cBetween low oil prices, strong demand for semiconductors and a very low inflationary environment, you have this benign and perfect scenario for South Korea despite all the rhetoric and uncertainty coming from the North,\u201d said       Sean Darby,        chief global equity strategist at Jefferies. \u201cInvestors are looking at these fundamentals and saying they\u2019re outweighing the political risk.\u201dOffshore investors have piled into South Korean stocks and bonds all year. Foreign bondholdings rose in June for a sixth straight month, according to South Korea\u2019s Financial Supervisory Service, the country\u2019s financial watchdog. Foreign equity holdings rose for a seventh straight month.Even last week, foreign investors were net buyers of South Korean equities, the only such example among Asian markets considered emerging, according to             Goldman Sachs.South Korea\u2019s Kospi has been one of the world\u2019s best-performing stock indexes this year. Its biggest component, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., has surged 35%, as demand for its components outshines political and product challenges. Samsung is set to overtake             Apple Inc.       as the world\u2019s most profitable technology company.South Korea\u2019s won has risen 4.9% against the U.S. dollar this year, easing some after being up as much as 8.6%. That is one of the strongest performances against the dollar in Asia: In comparison, the new Taiwan dollar has advanced 6.1%, the Japanese yen 2.3% and the Chinese yuan 2.2%.One reason is that South Korea\u2019s central bank has largely stayed on the sidelines rather than stepping in to slow the currency\u2019s rise, as it often has in the past, analysts say. One sign: Foreign-exchange reserves in June were up just 2.8% from a year earlier, well below the recent peak pace of 12.7% three years ago. Intervening to rein in the won would typically boost the reserves, as it would involve using won to buy foreign currencies.Markets globally remain calm, and investors are signaling they don\u2019t expect that to change significantly in the near future. One-month implied volatility for the U.S. dollar against the Korean won, which measures how much investors expect the currency pair will move over the next 30 days, fell to a two-year low late last month, according to Thomson Reuters. It has since ticked higher, but still suggests that traders see low volatility continuing.In recent years, North Korea\u2019s provocations and threats have had diminishing impacts on financial markets, particularly on stocks and currencies, according to a 2016 academic paper by Ju       Hyun Pyun       of Korea University and In Huh of the Catholic University of Korea. The study, which focused on 2004 through 2015, found that market moves in the first few years of the period were larger and more significant than in later years, suggesting investors had grown accustomed to political risks.Market volatility has picked up a bit in the past few weeks; the MSCI AC Asia Pacific index dropped 1.2% last week, its biggest decline since March. But that appears to be more an effect of hawkish rhetoric from central bankers, particularly the European Central Bank than of anything out of North Korea.Mark Matthews,        head of research for Asia at Swiss private bank             Julius Baer,       says only about one in five clients asks about how the situation in North Korea could affect their portfolios.\u201cWe\u2019ve become immune to it,\u201d he says. \u201cInvestors just assume that every new development is one of the hundreds of bluffs that North Korea has done in the past.\u201dWrite to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com and Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 08:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nuclear-missile-scares-fail-to-shake-investors-out-of-south-korea-1499688235", "news_title": "Nuclear, Missile Scares Fail to Shake Investors out of South Korea ", "keywords": "dollar-won,investor sentiment,korea bonds,korea markets,korea stocks,north korea nuclear,north korea weapons,south korea markets,won-dollar,equity markets,debt,bond markets,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,derivative securities,commodity,financial market news,credit derivatives,government debt,swaps,banking,credit,financial services,integrated banks"}, {"content": "A handful of investors recently began extending short-term loans to an affiliate of             Ford Motor Co.        F 0.68%       after more than a decadelong hiatus, opening a key borrowing spigot for the blue-chip auto maker, which was locked out of money markets in the last recession.In recent months, a money-market fund of             Federated Investors        FII 1.31%       has been buying a kind of short-term IOU called \u201ccommercial paper\u201d from Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC. The Federated Capital Reserves Fund now holds about $148 million of debt, according to fund tracker Crane Data.Ford Motor Credit has made a comeback since being struck off Federated\u2019s eligible investments list in 2003, when the vehicle-financing company showed signs of struggling and was later downgraded to below-investment grade. It has since been upgraded to investment grade.The Federated holding, while small, is notable because it signals a potential thaw in relations between money funds and auto companies that could later benefit others, including             General Motors Co.       and             Fiat Chrysler Automobiles                   NV. GM and Chrysler Group LLC filed for bankruptcy in 2009.\u201cAutos are generally tied to the consumer, and the consumer, we think, is very healthy right now,\u201d said       Debbie Cunningham,        chief investment officer for money markets at Federated in Pittsburgh.She said auto loans are generally the highest priority payment for consumers, behind mortgages, and thus offer a solid investment for funds willing to consider issuers in the lower tier of the highest short-term rating categories.Robert Cheddar,        portfolio manager at PFM Asset Management LLC, which manages about $63 billion on behalf of state and local governments, said Ford\u2019s fundamental condition has improved. For clients that will allow it, he started buying the company\u2019s commercial paper last year.Ford Motor Credit had $4.98 billion of commercial paper as of March 31 and is \u201ca much stronger credit\u201d today, said       Stephen Brown,        senior director at Fitch Ratings. Last May, Fitch upgraded the issuer\u2019s commercial paper program to F2, equivalent to the second lowest rung of investment grade, from F3.Ford Motor Credit declined to comment.The interest from Federated reflects the yield offered on the debt\u2014about 1.3%, above what is available on short-term Treasurys and bank commercial paper\u2014as well as Ford\u2019s progress in returning to better health.It also points to an increasing appetite among large money managers using separately managed accounts to oversee client money. Crane Data calculates that separately managed accounts have grown by as much as $40 billion to $500 billion since new Securities and Exchange Commission rules for traditional money-market funds came in last October.\u201cIt\u2019s mostly separate accounts and corporate investors that are buying [Ford\u2019s commercial] paper,\u201d said Mr. Cheddar at PFM.Commercial paper, which is typically issued anywhere from overnight to 270 days, is generally considered one of the cheapest forms of borrowing because most issuers have high credit ratings and investors loan their cash over short periods.Most money funds never buy commercial paper rated below the top rung of investment grade. But the new SEC rules removed rating requirements for money-market funds. Previously, funds were required to invest at least 97% of their assets in securities with only the highest short-term credit ratings.In 2016, Ford tapped the longer-term debt markets for the first time in nearly four years, raising $2.8 billion. While Ford Motor Credit was locked out money markets in the financial crisis, it used other sources of funding such as selling bonds backed by future revenues from car loans, as well as credit facilities from banks.Write to Katy Burne at katy.burne@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Financing Avenue Reopens For Ford.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-key-borrowing-spigot-opens-for-ford-1499688001", "news_title": "A Key Borrowing Spigot Opens for Ford ", "keywords": "auto loans,commercial paper,ford,ford credit rating,ford motor credit,money managers,money-market funds,separately managed accounts,Federated Capital Reserves Fund,Ford Motor Credit,Ford Motor,F,Federated Investors,FII,General Motors,GM,Debbie Cunningham,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,money,currency markets,money markets,commodity,financial market news,motor vehicles,passenger cars,credit types,services,sales financing,consumer lending,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,automotive,banking,credit,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "China wants its biggest, most acquisitive, highly leveraged companies to tone it down -- apparently by selling assets to other big, acquisitive highly leveraged companies.Dalian Wanda Group, controlled by billionaire       Wang Jianlin,        who said last year his theme parks could beat Disneyland, is selling a controlling stake in most of its tourist attractions, together with most of its hotels in China, to property developer             Sunac China        1918 15.00%for $9.3 billion.The sale came after the Journal reported last month that China\u2019s banking regulator was looking into the debt of some top overseas deal makers, including Wanda.

Sunac\u2019s chairman, Sun Hongbin, who owns 54% of the company, may have pledged most of his shares to a bank to finance his purchases of Sunac\u2019s shares, according to Hong Kong stock exchange filings by the company and a lender, Ping An Bank.Sunac has just enough cash, including restricted cash, to finance the Wanda purchase, but that would more than double its net debt. This seems to defeat the purpose to contain runaway debt within China\u2019s financial system. But unlike Wanda, Sunac has raised all debt to buy domestic land and properties, important drivers for China\u2019s economy, instead of splurging on overseas assets.Capital outflows, instead of leverage, are Beijing\u2019s real worry.Write to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 07:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/here-comes-another-chinese-company-on-a-buying-binge-1499687155", "news_title": "Here Comes Another Chinese Company on a Buying Binge", "keywords": "china,dalian wanda,le pac,sunac china,wang jianlin,AMC Entertainment,AMC,Dalian Wanda Group,Sunac China Holdings,1918.HK,HK:1918,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,physical asset transactions,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,commodity,financial market news,diversified holding companies,real estate transactions,property managers,film,video exhibition,business,consumer services,real estate,construction,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "Good morning.

Expect record numbers of shoppers and scores of obligatory blog posts about the weirdest items up for grabs at a discount.The News Media Alliance, a U.S. newspaper trade body of which The Wall Street Journal is a member, is asking for a limited antitrust exemption from Congress for newspapers to be able to band together to negotiate collectively with Google and Facebook and attempt to alter the pair\u2019s dominance of the digital advertising industry, the New York Times reports. As the article points out, by asking for antitrust clearance, the publishers are seeking to avoid what happened a few years ago when the Justice Department sued Apple and book-publishing houses over the fixing of e-book prices. Writing in the Journal, News Media Alliance Chief Executive David Chavern argues, \u201cToday, antitrust laws are insulating Google and Facebook from market forces. News publishers are committed to unleashing those forces to defend their investments in great journalism.\u201d Mr. Chavern suggests newspapers want stronger intellectual-property protections, better support for subscription models and a \u201cfair share\u201d of revenue and data. It\u2019s never wise to reveal your entire hand ahead of entering a negotiation, but what\u2019s unclear is precisely how hard the newspaper groups can push Facebook and Google to level the playing field at this late stage in the game.Fox News has experienced a tumultuous few months, having seen two of its top stars depart, but the channel is still holding on to the No. 1 position in the cable-news ratings battle, WSJ\u2019s Joe Flint reports. Fox also has been able to bump up its ad prices, thanks to a more-favorable mix among the key adult demographic. Tucker Carlson\u2019s audience size in the 8 p.m. slot is 5% lower than his predecessor Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s\u2014but his ad rates are 21% higher. Mr. Carlson\u2019s contract with the network is also \u201csignificantly less\u201d than Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s $25 million a year deal, making the new lineup more cost-effective. All that said, MSNBC is closing the gap, with its audience among viewers ages 25 to 54 up 72% year over year in the quarter that ended in June. 21st Century Fox and WSJ parent News Corp share common ownership.UBS Wealth Management\u2019s global head of marketing communications, Thierry Campet, gave an unusually honest assessment of the finance firm\u2019s struggles with content marketing, the Drum reports. UBS set up a content creation arm called Unlimited in partnership with Vice, Vanity Fair, The Future Laboratory and Monocle that was designed to help it reach wealthy millennials. But UBS encountered a problem. Surprise, surprise, people weren\u2019t jumping out of bed in the morning thinking, \u201cI must consume some content from UBS!\u201d (Speak for yourselves.) Mr. Campet said UBS had overinvested in content creation at the expense of spending on advertising designed to actually get that content in front of people. As a result, UBS has cut its content creation budget by 10%. It\u2019s a classic case of a brand being so satisfied with its own art, the blinkers were on when it came to formulating the right media mix. \u201cIf you don\u2019t push it they won\u2019t see it,\u201d Mr. Campet said. \u201cThat was a huge learning for us\u2014we really thought the content would sell on its own, and it didn\u2019t.\u201dThe Super Bowl is without a doubt the annual advertising tentpole event, and each year the price for a 30-second spot rises and rises. But there could be a limit. Ad buyers don\u2019t want to pony up more than $5 million for a big game spot next year, Variety reports. Anheuser-Busch\u2019s U.S. marketing chief, Marcel Marcondes, said that as more people watch sports via video streams, \u201cthe negotiations about the price should change as well\u201d (although Super Bowl TV ratings have held steady at about 110 million viewers for years). One ad buyer said Super Bowl broadcaster NBC is \u201clooking to get flat what Fox got\u201d this year in terms of ad rates for its big game broadcast. NBC is still seeking \u201cnorth of $5 million\u201d for a 30-second spot, the network said. What may have also helped maintain advertiser demand is that NBC is due to broadcast the Winter Olympics four days after the Super Bowl, so it has been able to create extended ad packages. That said, in a low-growth environment for many clients that has seen some big names shift to zero-base budgeting, $5 million is a tough psychological barrier to leap over.Deutsche Telekom is considering shaking up its media operations as it reduces TV advertising and boosts spending on Facebook and Google.

At the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Western leaders spent the weekend fulminating about steelworker jobs.But in China, where massive steel overcapacity has helped sink global prices, a funny thing is happening: Steel prices are rising, even as most commodities remain under pressure. That trend, if sustained, could have major implications for global markets\u2014and politics\u2014as the plight of steelworkers remains a political live wire throughout the Western world.And unlike in the past, there are hints that the latest rally isn\u2019t only about China building more apartment towers. Overcapacity, the scourge of Chinese industry and a major cause of the country\u2019s huge debt problem, is a moving target: Factory-utilization rates always go up when the economy is doing relatively well, as it is now.That doesn\u2019t seem to be the whole story this time, however. Steel prices are rising, but overall inflation is cooling\u2014June data released Monday showed most factory-gate prices trending sideways or down, but steel prices rallied. Also, prices for steel rebar\u2014often produced from scrap by small electric induction furnaces\u2014have done especially well this year. Those same furnaces this year have been a main target of Chinese regulators, who vowed to eliminate them by mid-2017.There is some evidence that campaign is working. Chinese production of steel products is down from a year ago despite healthy demand from developers in inland cities, where falling housing inventories are supporting construction.Less supply and decent demand mean gross margins for China\u2019s iron-and-steel sector as a whole hit their highest level since 2008 in the first quarter, and have now been above 8% for nine straight months, the best performance since the global financial crisis. Partly as a result, listed Chinese steel shares such as Hesteel and Baoshan are on a tear: They are up 34% and 14%, respectively, so far this year. And in contrast to iron ore, steel has held on to most of its price gain after last year\u2019s U.S. election.China has a long and checkered history of \u201cclosing\u201d excess steel and coal capacity only to allow it to roar back when inflation ticks higher\u2014if broader price pressures in the economy re-emerge, that pattern might repeat itself. And to be sure, overcapacity remains severe despite limited progress: Margins at 8% are nothing to write home about, considering they were consistently above 10% in the early part of the previous decade.Still, any sign of progress is welcome. Investors watching the world\u2019s leaders duke it out on steel can take some comfort in some signs of progress, however preliminary, in China.Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 07:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-china-is-upending-global-steel-industry-once-more-1499684494", "news_title": "China Is Driving Steel Prices Higher This Time", "keywords": " china, chinese, factories,heard on the street, iron ore, price, steel, tariffs, trump,Donald Trump,Hesteel A,CN:000709,Baoshan Iron & Steel A,CN:600019,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commodity markets,metals markets,commodity,financial market news,iron ore markets,steel markets,primary metals,steel,iron products,basic materials,resources"}, {"content": "NGP Energy Capital Management, an oil-and-gas investment firm backed by             Carlyle Group                   LP, is seeking $5.3 billion for new pursuits in the energy patch, said people familiar with the matter.The private-equity firm started raising capital for NGP Natural Resources XII LP in April, setting its sights on one of the largest energy funds in the market.NGP is looking to match the roughly $5.33 billion it amassed for its previous energy fund in early 2015, and could raise up to slightly more than $5.8 billion this time, one of the people said.The 28-year-old firm made a name for itself backing management teams that launched exploration and production ventures and other oil-and-gas wagers. Its newest fund is the first flagship energy pool NGP is marketing without any of its founding partners on the firm\u2019s executive committee.The fundraising momentum it is able to generate will be a test of investor confidence in the second generation of leaders at its helm\u2014and NGP\u2019s ability to navigate through oil-price swings that are raising the stakes for energy firms.NGP began a process of transferring leadership and ownership from its founders to a new generation after Carlyle took a stake in the Irving, Texas, firm in 2012.Since then,       Tony Weber       and       Chris Carter       have taken charge as the firm\u2019s managing partners. NGP\u2019s three original founding partners scaled back their leadership roles and were named advisory partners last year, one person said.Kenneth Hersh,        who was NGP\u2019s chief executive, transitioned to a role as chairman in 2015. He scaled back his position overseeing Carlyle\u2019s energy and natural resources group last year. Mr. Hersh was on NGP\u2019s executive committee when the firm launched its previous energy fund in 2014, but isn\u2019t on that committee now, the person added.The firm\u2019s investment team has changed in the past three years as it has added new hires, while others have left to start their own shops. William \u201cBilly\u201d Quinn, a managing partner, left NGP at the end of 2013 and launched Pearl Energy Investments in 2015. Carnelian Energy Capital and Edge Natural Resources were other firms founded by former NGP deal makers around that time.The arrival of these firms demonstrates how new players are tossing their hats in the ring in hopes of profiting from the energy shakeout.Other energy funds are raising money as well. EnCap Investments has collected $6.2 billion in investor dollars so far for the largest private-equity energy fund being raised. Quantum Energy Partners is seeking as much as $5.25 billion for its latest fundraising drive.NGP launched a blank-check company,             Vantage Energy Acquisition Corp.      , which held an initial public offering this year. It also has scored profits from some endeavors in the oil-rich Permian Basin. In June, the firm cashed out from upstream oil-and-gas venture Black Mountain Oil & Gas LLC, taking home 4.1 times its initial investment, said a person familiar with the matter.NGP also sold interests in exploration and production company Centennial Resource Development in 2016, making 2.6 times its invested capital, and expects to back the management team again, the person said.As of March, NGP\u2019s previous energy fund, NGP Natural Resources XI LP, delivered 1.3 times invested capital since its 2014 launch, according to a Carlyle quarterly financial report. An earlier fund, NGP Natural Resources X LP, formed in 2012, delivered 1.2 times invested capital as of that month.Write to Dawn Lim at dawn.lim@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ngp-seeks-5-3-billion-for-new-pursuits-in-energy-patch-1499684400", "news_title": "NGP Seeks $5.3 Billion for New Pursuits in Energy Patch ", "keywords": "trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,financial investments,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Good morning,Senate Republicans returning from a July 4 recess are so divided over a health-overhaul bill that they are also struggling to agree on what to do if they fail to pass one. Some conservative lawmakers say failure would give them a chance to return to their goal of fully repealing the Affordable Care Act, putting off replacement until later. Others, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, are considering the possibility of legislation to shore up the health-insurance marketplaces created by the ACA\u2014action that would involve working with Democrats. A vote on the current bill, if one occurs, would likely come in mid-to-late July, with Congress\u2019s August recess serving as the next deadline.

The meeting, in New York City, was also attended by Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s campaign chairman at the time. \u201cIt quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information,\u201d Mr. Trump Jr. said in a statement Sunday.

It hopes to have about 40 human traders in a space at the Chicago Board of Trade Building. Box\u2019s initial plan, though, drew critical letters this year from CBOE Holdings and from the NYSE, as well as trading firms that said another trading venue will make it tougher to do business as activity might become less transparent and more fragmented.Vacation exercise is an almost paradoxical concept.

China\u2019s Cosco Shipping Holdings Co. is buying a controlling stake in Hong Kong-based             Orient Overseas (International) Ltd.        0316 -0.07%       Co. for $6.3 billion, in an acquisition that takes container shipping\u2019s rapid consolidation to a new level. The WSJ\u2019s Costas Paris and Joanne Chiu report the Chinese conglomerate joined port operator Shanghai International Port (Group) Co. to buy control of the operator of Orient Overseas Container Lines, the No. 8 container line by capacity. The combined business will vault Cosco Shipping ahead of France\u2019s CMA CGM SA to make it the third-largest carrier in the world, and will give Cosco a far bigger share of trans-Pacific trade. It means six super carriers will be grouped into three shipping alliances that haul about three-quarters of all seaborne trade. Consolidation is hardly over: Japan\u2019s three big shipping lines are still combining their operations, and Cosco would have to buy at least one more carrier if the Chinese company wants to move into the No. 1 position.The \u201clast mile\u201d is proving to be the prime spot for hiring in logistics. Package-delivery companies ramped up hiring in June for the third month in a row, WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Jennifer Smith writes, as truck operators and railroads extended their pullback in payrolls by cutting a combined 2,200 jobs. The parcel carriers and heavy freight haulers are moving in different directions as broader hiring trends suggesting shifts in underlying economic demand. Services industries like health care accounted for the biggest share of the strong U.S. jobs growth last month while manufacturing and other industrial sectors lagged behind. Courier and delivery companies added 4,200 jobs last month, and that sector and warehouse and storage companies both have expanded hiring by around 35,000 jobs in the past year. The most-recent hiring suggests they\u2019re still seeing strong demand this summer, and preparing for far more in the fall.The staples of supermarket supply chains are losing their grip on consumers. Big brands like             Kellogg\u2019s                   cereal, Campbell\u2019s soup and Hamburger Helper are struggling with competition, squeezed at the high end by consumers looking for fresher foods and at the low-price end by the growing role of store brands. That\u2019s triggering a dramatic restructuring in the food business, the WSJ\u2019s Annie Gasparro and Saabira Chauhuri report, as companies like             Kraft Heinz Co.       and Nestl\u00e9 SA look to consolidation to gain more cost-saving benefits of scale even as they try to get more nimble to respond to leaner but faster competitors. It\u2019s a classic business tale, with companies carving out big positions and sustained revenue in a market while adapting too slowly to changing trends. The heavyweight role they play in production and distribution channels helps the big brands move their goods more efficiently, but the 25 biggest food and beverage companies have been losing market share, suggesting they\u2019re not moving the goods that consumers want.Leaders of the world\u2019s biggest economies are trying to have it both ways on trade. The final statement from the Group of 20 countries meeting in Hamburg over the weekend included a vow to fight protectionism, but the WSJ\u2019s Emre Peker and William Horobin report the G-20 leaders also stepped back from an unequivocal commitment to free trade. Instead, the countries are trying to respond to rising protectionist movements by saying they recognize the need for defensive trade measures. That\u2019s a bow to the defiantly unilateral stance President       Donald Trump       has taken, but European officials believe it also signals a new international consensus on economic issues can be rebuilt. With the European Union already advancing new trade pacts this year that include Canada and Japan, countries already are setting up closer ties while the U.S. tries to figure out how to turn the country\u2019s changed stance on trade into new negotiations.\u2018They stopped experimenting because they could buy aisles in the grocery store.\u2019Twenty-foot equivalent units, or TEUs, of total global container shipping capacity operating in June, the first time the business has exceeded 20 million TEUS, according to Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says the economies of the U.S., U.K. and Russia have weakened this year.

Some of the lawmakers have previously expressed concern about the $20 million sale, which is part of a plan to reinvent the 135-year-old exchange as a bridge between U.S. capital markets and Chinese entrepreneurs.The lawmakers argue the SEC should be wary of the deal because the regulator may not be able to monitor the extent of Chinese ownership. U.S. exchanges typically limit any one entity or participant\u2019s control over their markets, in an effort to safeguard the independence of their regulatory duties.\u201cWith little or no insight and transparency into government-dominated Chinese markets, the SEC will be unable to monitor the ownership structure\u2026leaving CHX open to undue, improper, and possibly state-driven influence,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in the letter, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.The letter was signed by a handful of Democratic and Republican House members\u2014including House Financial Services Committee member Rep.       Robert Pittenger       (R., N.C.) and       Rosa DeLauro       (D., Conn.)\u2014who are often skeptical of free trade and international investment. The SEC is an independent agency and can make decisions that conflict with the wishes of lawmakers, but Congress\u2019 views often get close attention at the agency.An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the letter, as did a spokesman for the Chicago Stock Exchange.If the SEC certifies the control change, the exchange\u2019s owners would include Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group Co., a private company with over 800 employees that has operations in China, Hong Kong, and Australia, according to merger documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.The Casin group hopes to take Chinese firms public on the Chicago exchange and wants to open a new exchange in southwest China, according to a March 2016 letter from Chicago exchange Chief Executive       John Kerin       to his company\u2019s shareholders.\u201cWe both see significant opportunities in the promotion of trans-Pacific equity trading between the two largest world economies,\u201d Mr. Kerin wrote.The group of prospective owners once included Beijing Guoli Energy Investment Co., according to the merger documents. Beijing Guoli\u2019s owners have included Chinese state-owned investment firms, according to a bidding document filed with the Australian Securities Exchange related to a Beijing Guoli subsidiary\u2019s acquisition last year of mining firm Cuesta Coal Ltd.Beijing Guoli dropped out of the group bidding for the Chicago venue before the exchange operator sought approval for the deal from the SEC and from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews deals for national-security concerns, according to an exchange spokesman. The security panel cleared the sale in December.The Chicago exchange has stated that none of its prospective owners are under the control of or affiliated with the Chinese government. The Chicago venue is one of 13 U.S. stock exchanges, but its market share of traded volume in May was just 0.4%, according to Tabb Group LLC.Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 06:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-call-on-sec-to-reject-chicago-stock-exchange-sale-to-group-of-chinese-investors-1499682600", "news_title": "Lawmakers Call on SEC to Reject Chicago Stock Exchange Sale to Group of Chinese Investors   ", "keywords": "chicago stock exchange,chicago stock exchange deal,chicago stock exchange sale,chinese investment,chinese investors in chicago stock exchange,finreg,Chicago Stock Exchange,Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group,Securities and Exchange Commission,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,equity markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "A substantial acceleration in global economic growth has become less likely this year as the outlooks for the U.S., U.K. and Russia have weakened, according to leading indicators released Monday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The Paris-based research body\u2019s gauges of future activity, based on data for May, pointed to faster growth in France and China. But that positive news was offset by \u201ctentative\u201d signs of a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy, as well as the U.K., Italy and Russia.Economic growth is still likely to pick up this year, but not to the same degree as previously anticipated. In a statement issued Saturday at the conclusion of their two-day meeting in Hamburg, Germany, leaders from the Group of 20 largest economies said that while prospects are \u201cencouraging,\u201d \u201cthe pace of growth is still weaker than desirable.\u201dIn the early months of this year, the leading indicators pointed to a pickup in U.S. growth. Economists, investors and businesses then expected to see some increases in investment spending and cuts in taxes under the then newly installed administration of President       Donald Trump.But those hopes have faded, as have expectations of a big bounce back in growth from a weak first quarter.Meanwhile, the U.K. appears to be suffering from a slowdown in consumer spending in response to a jump in inflation linked to the pound\u2019s depreciation in the wake of a June 2016 vote to leave the European Union.The OECD\u2019s leading indicators are designed to provide early signals of turning points between the expansion and slowdown of economic activity, and are based on a variety of data series that have a history of anticipating swings in future economic activity. The changes in economic activity signaled by the indicators usually follow six to nine months after they are recorded.The OECD\u2019s composite leading indicator for its 34 members was steady at 100.0 in May.

BL 1.59%       began offering employees corporate credit cards 12 years ago when chief executive Therese Tucker realized some staff couldn\u2019t afford to wait until they were reimbursed for work expenses.\u201cMost people are bad at personal finance,\u201d she said.The corporate credit-card program removed the stress on employees\u2019 personal budgets while allowing BlackLine to easily track work travel expenses, she added.The use of corporate cards and other payment technologies is on the rise. About one in five finance departments said they would invest more in company-backed credit cards this year, according to a report by Strategic Treasurer, a consultancy. The move is driven by security concerns, with 72% of respondents concerned with the potential of external hacks.Slightly more than one-fourth of companies plan to spend more than $250,000 on payments technology. The 2017 B2B Payments & Working Capital Management Survey tallied responses from 355 finance executives globally.Ms. Tucker said expanding the corporate card program to more employees netted BlackLine better terms with their card provider. The whole process is automated, eliminating delays and paperwork. The Los Angeles-based company has doled out cards to 300 of its 650 employees.Handing out corporate cards to employees turned out to be lucrative for             Just Energy Group Inc.       The company didn\u2019t want to miss out on competitive pricing from a growing array of digital vendors such as Amazon Prime or Uber Eats that require credit-card payments, said finance chief       Patrick McCullough.The biggest challenge was making sure everyone is on the same page about what type of expenses staff can charge to the account. The Canadian natural-gas and electricity retailer outlined those ground rules and now oversees fewer transactions while suppliers are compensated more swiftly, he said.\u201cIt is difficult to function without cards,\u201d Mr. McCullough said. \u201cAs the world becomes more digital, credit card usage has to expand.\u201dThe shift to plastic could help companies net some savings. Suppliers often offer discounts to businesses that pay for goods swiftly, rather than 30 to 60 days after receiving a shipment. Companies can set up automatic, recurring credit-card payments to suppliers to make sure they take advantage of those offers.Businesses are also finding ways to become more efficient in handling corporate cards. More than 90% of 104 professionals in the commercial card and payments space said their company intends to implement new commercial-card tools and services this year, according to a survey by Capital One. This includes an interface to manage different types of payments in one space, or higher rebates on their purchases.Virtual cards are the fastest-growing category in the payment industry, according to Jeff Felser, head of treasury management payables at             PNC Financial Services Group Inc.       Virtual cards are unique card numbers tied to an actual card-account number. Transacting with a one-time number instead of an actual card number eliminates the risk of the card details being leaked in case of a data breach, he said.\u201cEmployers want ease in convenience and flexibility when making payments,\u201d Mr. Felser said.", "news_time": "2017-07-10 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/finance-chiefs-want-you-to-use-plastic-not-paper-1499679002", "news_title": "Finance Chiefs Want You to Use Plastic, Not Paper ", "keywords": "amazon prime,corporate credit cards,credit cards,strategic treasurer,uber eats,BlackLine,BL,corporate funding,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,credit types,services,banking,credit,computing,financial services,plastic cards,technology,vertical market applications software"}, {"content": "Kabul and Islamabad\u00a0have agreed\u00a0to work on a mechanism to jointly\u00a0combat\u00a0insurgents along their shared border, cooperating more closely than they have in years as the U.S. prepares to ramp up its troop numbers in Afghanistan,\u00a0according to Pakistani and Afghan officials.The move, seen as necessary to halting the flow of fighters fueling a Taliban insurgency, would be an important step in the struggle to stabilize Afghanistan.Washington has long tried to get Pakistan and Afghanistan to work together to squeeze Taliban militants. A visiting U.S. Senate delegation led by       John McCain       (R., Ariz.) helped push the two nations into discussions last week.The Pakistani offer to resurrect joint counterterrorism operations comes ahead of a\u00a0review by the Trump administration of American policy toward Afghanistan, expected to be completed this month, that could be tough on Islamabad.\u00a0The U.S.-Pakistan relationship has come to be defined by\u00a0the security situation\u00a0in Afghanistan, and\u00a0many in Washington blame Islamabad for havens along its border that have allowed the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan to survive and strengthen. Both Islamabad and Kabul have accused each other of allowing hostile factions to operate in their territories.Pakistan says it has cleared extremist sanctuaries on its soil and its security worries in Afghanistan have never been addressed by Kabul and Washington. Islamabad sees a failing U.S. and Afghan strategy at fault for what American commanders describe as a \u201cstalemate\u201d on the battlefield.Washington and Kabul, meanwhile, accuse Islamabad of using the Taliban and the allied Haqqani network as its proxies in Afghanistan, to counter the influence of its foe India there. Pakistan denies the charge.The new coordinated effort comes as President Donald Trump and his aides are considering new ways to push Islamabad into doing more to help the U.S., including punitive measures to limit aid to Pakistan and to strip the country of its status as a major non-NATO ally.\u201cU.S. achievements in Afghanistan have lot to do with support from and through Pakistan. Any unilateral U.S. action will be anti to our existing cooperation and disadvantageous for peace and stability in the region,\u201d said Maj. Gen.       Asif Ghafoor,        the spokesman of Pakistan\u2019s military. \u201cPakistan is part of the solution, not part of the problem.\u201dThe proposed cooperation, conveyed to Kabul in recent days via the visiting senators, would see Pakistan and Afghanistan forces coordinate operations on their respective territories to tackle militants who move back and forth across the border, known as the Durand Line, Maj. Gen. Ghafoor said. Border coordination centers would be established, with officers from the other country stationed there. Pakistan is already fencing parts of the border, on which it has deployed 200,000 soldiers.\u201cThis is a shift in Pakistan\u2019s policy,\u201d a senior Afghan security official said. \u201cWe welcome it and look forward to some practical results.\u201dThe plan envisages the U.S. monitoring and verifying the coordinated border operations. A senior official at the U.S.-led Resolute Support military coalition said it was too early to comment on the idea but added: \u201cWe have the capacity to do this, if it comes to fruition.\u201dBut Pakistan\u2019s border-security proposals were met skeptically by\u00a0some\u00a0current and former U.S. officials, who view them as a sign that Islamabad isn\u2019t taking the depth of American concerns seriously.\u201cThis does not look like a road into new territory,\u201d a former Trump administration official said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything new in the ideas of coordinated action and third-party verification. The former is Pakistani code for pointing to Afghan military failings, and the latter is Afghan code for \u2018We want the Americans to blame the Pakistanis.\u2019 \u201dThe Trump administration\u2019s policy review for Afghanistan has been slowed by an internal debate over how to deal with Pakistan, according to current and former U.S. officials. There appears to be broad support in the administration for a tougher approach to Pakistan, though there has been no agreement on how far to press Islamabad. At least one faction is concerned that such steps could backfire.\u201cToo many sticks, too much pressure, could create a worse overall dynamic,\u201d a second former Trump administration official said.Afghan officials said they would like China, seen as a country Islamabad listens to, to play a role in verifying the operations and prodding Pakistan to crack down on the Taliban. Chinese foreign minister       Wang Yi       last month shuttled between Islamabad and Kabul to encourage the two sides to collaborate on counterterrorism and to search for a peace settlement with the Taliban, according to a joint statement.Until 2014, a tripartite arrangement coordinated operations along the border between Pakistan, Afghanistan and the U.S.-led coalition.\u201cThere will be coordinated operations on both sides of the Durand Line, and the U.S. will supervise the operations. The Afghan military is working to develop a mechanism for the operation,\u201d said       Dawa Khan Minapal,        a spokesman for Afghan President       Ashraf Ghani.Capt.       William Salvin,        a spokesman for the Resolute Support coalition, said: \u201cWe are supportive of efforts to fight the scourge of terrorism on both sides of the border.\u201dThe U.S. embassy in Islamabad declined to comment. Mr. McCain\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\u201cConversations with our friends in Pakistan were frank and candid, and we told them that in our view that the Haqqani having a safe zone in their country was not acceptable,\u201d Mr. McCain told a press conference in Kabul\u00a0on Tuesday.\u2014Habib Khan Totakhil\u00a0and Jessica Donati in Kabul contributed to this article.Write to Saeed Shah at saeed.shah@wsj.com and Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Pakistan, Afghanistan to Combat Terror.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pakistan-and-afghanistan-look-to-coordinate-on-counterterrorism-1499679003", "news_title": "Pakistan and Afghanistan Look to Coordinate on Counterterrorism ", "keywords": "afghanistan,afghanistan pakistan,afghanistan war,counterterrorism,john mccain,pakistan,resolute support military coalition ,taliban,trump administration,u.s. pakistan,war in afghanistan,Taliban,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,risk news,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "The center of gravity in central banking is shifting away from the U.S. and toward Europe, where officials are considering winding down years of extraordinary economic stimulus.Skittish investors pounced on a tiny hint buried in minutes of the most recent European Central Bank meeting Thursday, triggering a selloff that pushed German 10-year government bond yields to their highest level in 18 months. That followed an earlier selloff on June 27 when ECB President       Mario Draghi       signaled the bank would slowly stop expanding its bond portfolio as the eurozone economy accelerates.Repercussions were felt across the Atlantic, helping boost U.S. 10-year Treasury yields by almost 0.25 percentage points over the past two weeks.The Federal Reserve is further along in the process of ending easy money than the ECB. It is raising short-term interest rates and preparing to shrink its bond portfolio, while ECB rates are negative and its portfolio is still expanding.Investors have already adjusted to the Fed\u2019s actions. They yawned when the U.S. central bank raised rates June 14 and didn\u2019t flinch three weeks later when officials signaled they might reduce the Fed\u2019s bond portfolio within a couple of months.\u201cThe Fed to some extent has handed the baton to other global central banks,\u201d said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       sought to make U.S. policy predictable and free of surprises. A healthy U.S. economy allowed the Fed to follow through on the plan it first laid out in December. It has raised rates twice in 2017 while penciling in a third move later this year and set the stage for shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio.The ECB, by contrast, is at a delicate inflection point. Though policy makers have sought to move slowly and predictably, investors are on tenterhooks, ready to adjust rapidly to a world of rising interest rates.\u201cThis is very unusual, particularly for U.S. investors,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. \u201cWhen I travel around the U.S., the conversation particularly around the Fed and U.S. interest rates starts with a discussion of what the ECB is doing.\u201dThe ECB is the most important buyer in European financial markets, sucking up around \u20ac2 billion a day of government and corporate debt.Top officials have been cautious about changing course, wary of upsetting the region\u2019s financial markets and economic recovery.Mr. Draghi\u2019s speech signaled that a turning point may be coming as an improving economy reduces the need for central bank help. A successful transition could take pressure off Mr. Draghi and focus the world\u2019s attention back on the Fed.The ECB chief\u2019s remarks coincided with statements by central banks in the U.K. and Canada indicating they would move toward higher interest rates. Policy makers are preparing to drop measures aimed at avoiding extreme threats, such as deflation, and return toward a more normal policy setting.\u201cMarkets are beginning to sense a regime change,\u201d said Lena Komileva, an economist with G+ Economics in London.Japan is a holdout. Officials there have given no sign they intend to pull back their stimulus measures soon.ECB money has pinned down interest rates across the eurozone for years and pumped up asset prices, from government bonds and stocks to real estate and high-yield debt. It has helped transform the eurozone from the global economy\u2019s weak link. Growth outpaced the U.S. in the first quarter.As interest rates rise, financial-market volatility is likely to increase and risky assets could suffer. \u201cCentral-bank liquidity values are getting flushed out of the system,\u201d said Ms. Komileva.Still, last week\u2019s market swings have perplexed ECB officials, who say they\u2019ve tried to telegraph the policy shift for months.\u201cI would argue that we have already adjusted our monetary policy,\u201d ECB executive-board member       Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9       said in an interview with two European newspapers published Friday, pointing to the bank\u2019s decision in December to slow its bond purchases to \u20ac60 billion a month from \u20ac80 billion.European central bankers want to avoid repeating the experience of their American counterparts. In 2013, then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke touched off a global bond selloff\u2014nicknamed the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d--when he suggested the Fed could ease its pace of bond-buying.Back then investors were skeptical the Fed would stop and Mr. Bernanke\u2019s signals whipsawed their thinking. The same thing might be happening now in Europe.\u201cMarkets have become used to doubting what central banks say unless they really see proof in the action itself,\u201d said Martin Lueck, chief German investment strategist at             BlackRock Inc.Adding to market skepticism about an end to easy money is the fact that inflation remains low globally.A monetary rebalancing could draw capital out of the U.S., reversing inflows from foreign investors seeking higher returns. Private foreign investors boosted their holdings of U.S. corporate debt by almost 20% between January 2015, when the ECB announced its asset-purchase program, and March of this year, according to the Treasury Department.European investors, in particular, could start moving money back home, helping to counter some of the effects of the ECB\u2019s withdrawal. They\u2019ve already been returning to European equities since about March, in part because they lost confidence the U.S. economy would surge as a result of President Trump\u2019s fiscal and regulatory policies, analysts said.For the Fed, the resurgence of Europe is good news since U.S. and European central bankers will no longer be pushing in opposite directions with the Fed tightening policy and the ECB loosening.But the transition to this new regime could be bumpy. U.S. government bonds and German government bonds are closely linked. What affects one often affects the other, meaning turbulence in Europe could spill into the U.S.\u201cYellen and Draghi need to talk,\u201d said Mr. Slok. \u201cCoordination and communication as much as possible would be best in terms of making sure that financial markets go through this in a smooth and steady way.\u201dWrite to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com and Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-10 05:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-turn-attention-to-ecb-after-fed-moves-on-interest-rates-1499677201", "news_title": "Investors Turn Attention to ECB After Fed Moves on Interest Rates", "keywords": "bond selloff,dollars,ecb,ecb bond buying,euros,euro zone,fed,fomc,interest rates,raising rates,stimulus measures,taper tantrum,European Central Bank,Federal Reserve,monetary policy,currency,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Italian banks are out of the emergency room. There is a long convalescence ahead, but it is good news for the recovery of Europe as a whole.The healing under way in Italy and elsewhere is making room for new lending, which can help to fuel economic growth.Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy\u2019s most troubled big bank, finally struck a deal with European regulators to complete its \u20ac5 billion ($5.7 billion) bailout this month.Meanwhile, a smaller troubled bank,         Banca Carige,       which had also been keeping fears of financial crisis alive, announced a capital raising and bad-loan sale plan that sent its shares up 30%.These solutions came swiftly after the state-backed sale to         Intesa Sanpaolo               of two banks in the Veneto region, which had been casting a shadow over the financial system.\u00a0Italian bank stocks have rallied sharply, outperforming European rivals significantly since mid-June.Between them, these events promise to take almost \u20ac50 billion of bad loans out of Italy\u2019s banks, leaving about \u20ac275 billion in the system. However,             UniCredit                   has pledged to sell \u20ac18 billion worth as part of its restructuring; and \u20ac57 billion are on the books of Intesa Sanpaolo, which as Italy\u2019s healthiest bank is well placed to deal with them.Italy\u2019s problems are starting to look less dramatic. Yes, the country could have dealt with its weak banks sooner and in a less complicated way had there been the political will. But it has now neutralized its worst problems at a direct cash cost to the taxpayer of less than 1% of GDP\u2014significantly less than Spain or Ireland spent several years ago.And loans are turning bad at a slower rate: New bad debts at the 15 biggest banks in 2016 were at their lowest since before 2009, according to rating agency DBRS.Now banks have the capacity to start lending again: Italian banks finally returned to growth in the first quarter of 2017, along with the banks of Germany and France, after years of near constant balance-sheet shrinkage.Growth in those three countries turned the tide for the eurozone as a whole. Total eurozone bank loans were still shrinking at an annualized rate of 11.6% of GDP in the first quarter of 2016 and 3.8% in the last quarter of that year, but that became annualized growth of 1.4% in the first quarter of 2017, according to UBS.Italy, long the source of worries about European instability, might finally be aiding the Continent\u2019s recovery.\u2014Paul J.

FB 0.79%       for the second time in 2017 is slashing the price of its Oculus Rift to jump-start sales after a rocky first year for the virtual-reality device.For the next six weeks, Facebook\u2019s Oculus VR unit will charge $399 for the Rift, Touch motion controllers and some games. Previously, Oculus sold that bundle for $598, itself a $200 discount from their combined launch prices.The new, temporarily lowered bundle price doesn\u2019t account for the cost of buying a computer powerful enough to support the Rift. It does, though, put the price of owning the high-end headset on par with its toughest competitor,             Sony Corp.\u2019s       PlayStation VR. That headset requires gamers to also buy a PlayStation 4 console, which runs anywhere from $249 to $399.The average number of Rift headsets sold each week went up after the first price cut, said       Jason Rubin,        head of content at Oculus. He said the company is lowering the price again to capitalize on a significant increase in recent months of the number of games and apps for the device. There are more than 700 today, up from roughly 400 in March.\u201cNow is the time to be pushing consumers into the product because they\u2019ll find exciting things to do,\u201d he said.The latest price cut comes as Oculus, which Facebook bought for more than $2 billion in 2014, faces mounting competition from             HTC Corp.       and Sony. Sales of headsets powered by smartphones have far outsold heavier-duty devices such as the Rift. And Oculus also has grappled with internal problems, resulting in the departure of co-founder       Palmer Luckey       in late March.Oculus hasn\u2019t disclosed sales for the Rift, but analysts say it continues to trail its rivals by a wide margin. Research firm IDC estimates the device has sold about 520,000 units world-wide to date, compared with 770,000 of HTC\u2019s Vive headsets and 1.6 million PlayStation VR headsets.Facebook said it has provided more than $250 million in funding to developers to drive more content for the Rift. The social-media company said it plans to dole out $250 million more over an undisclosed period.Virtual reality still doesn\u2019t have a breakout hit game or app, though, something analysts say is critical for broadening its appeal. Meanwhile, executives at large technology companies have shifted their focus in recent months to VR\u2019s cousin, augmented reality.At Facebook\u2019s annual developer conference in April, Chief Executive       Mark Zuckerberg       said the company would make its augmented-reality tools available to third parties. It is also developing its own augmented-reality glasses.Write to Sarah E.

Writing that commenters have been divided on best-interest contract requirements throughout the rule-making process, the department said that it \u201cis interested in the possibility of regulatory changes that could alter or eliminate contractual\u2026requirements.\u201dTogether, legal observers say, the Labor Department moves indicate the agency is considering eliminating the best-interest contract from the fiduciary rule as it conducts an economic-impact review ordered by President Donald       Trump       in February. The contract currently would require retirement-account stewards to provide a legally binding promise to put clients\u2019 interests first and allow investors to bring class-action lawsuits against those they say breached their fiduciary duty. The threat of such litigation was included in the fiduciary rule to effectively serve as the regulation\u2019s main enforcement mechanism.\u201cThat was the stick,\u201d said       Erin Sweeney,        an attorney at Miller & Chevalier Chartered who represents parties in litigation regarding fiduciary obligations, of the regulation\u2019s so-called right of private action. It was \u201cintended to be a warning to the industry that if they didn\u2019t behave, they faced the class-action threat,\u201d she said.The heart of the rule became effective last month after Labor Secretary       Alexander Acosta       said \u201crespect for the rule of law\u201d precluded further delay while the agency\u2019s review plays out. However, Mr. Acosta didn\u2019t eliminate the possibility of a repeal or revision after the Labor Department completes that review at the end of the year.Many critics of the fiduciary rule had hoped Mr.       Trump\u2019s       election would bring an end to a regulation that they say will hamper investor access to advice and poses excessive and disruptive legal risk. But the fiduciary rule has been hard to kill, in large part because of the Obama administration\u2019s careful six-year rule-writing process that was meant to withstand legal scrutiny and industry objections.Now, the Trump administration is \u201ctelegraphing the fact that they want to look for alternatives\u201d to the meatiest and more onerous compliance aspects, said Robert Cirrotti, head of retirement and investment solutions at Pershing LLC, a division of             Bank of New York Mellon Corp.Lifting the legal liability facing brokers and insurance agents who handle retirement savings is \u201ckind of clever, really,\u201d Ms. Sweeney said. If the Labor Department cuts the best-interest contract, the rule is alive and in effect. But with no contract, it isn\u2019t enforceable in any practical way, she said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a doorway open to get to court. There\u2019s no contract to sue on.\u201dThe department could also opt to keep the best-interest contract but throw out the class-action provision by eliminating the requirement that brokers and firms who want to use the regulation\u2019s exemption aren\u2019t allowed to have clients waive their right to bring class-action suits. To do so would mean investors who allege failure to uphold the fiduciary standard have to bring cases through the industry\u2019s arbitration system.Write to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Retirement Rule Could Lose Some Bite.'", "news_time": "2017-07-10 00:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fiduciary-rule-review-zeros-in-on-industry-costs-liabilities-1499515201", "news_title": "Fiduciary-Rule Review Zeroes In on Industry Costs, Liabilities", "keywords": "conflicts of interest,fiduciary rule,financial adviser,retirement planning,wealth management,Robert Cirrotti,Erin Sweeney,Donald Trump,Alexander Acosta,corporate crime,legal action,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,class action,settlements,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking"}]
