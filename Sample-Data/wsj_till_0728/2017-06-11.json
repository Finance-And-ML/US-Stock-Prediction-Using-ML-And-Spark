The U.S. held Mexico to 0-0 in qualifiers at Azteca in 1997 and 2013.With Estadio Azteca at 7,820 feet above sea level and just two off days between games, Arena paid close attention to recovery time and tested his roster\u2019s depth.Bradley, one of just four holdovers in the U.S. starting lineup from Thursday night\u2019s 2-0 home win over Trinidad, stunned the boisterous crowd of about 81,000. Hector Moreno passed to Hernandez, who passed back for Herrera in the center circle.Reading the play, Bradley quickly stepped up and knocked the ball toward Mexico\u2019s goal.

As widely expected, Bette Midler, who plays the show\u2019s title character, was named best leading actress in a musical.Among plays, the winners included the new works \u201cIndecent\u201d and \u201cOslo\u201d and the revivals of \u201cJitney\u201d and \u201cThe Little Foxes.\u201d\u201cOslo\u201d was named best play. \u201cJitney\u201d received the honor for best revival of a play.The awards show, hosted by Oscar- and Tony-winner       Kevin Spacey,        proved a lively affair. Mr. Spacey opened with an ambitious number in which he re-enacted scenes from all four of the shows nominated for best musical. Joining him in the high jinks: late-night TV fixture       Stephen Colbert       and actress and former Tony host       Whoopi Goldberg.Mr. Spacey also poked fun at the fact he wasn\u2019t the first pick to helm this year\u2019s Tonys. In that vein, he did a spot-on impersonation of       Johnny Carson,        a regular host of awards shows, later in the night. \u201cCome on admit it, you missed me,\u201d said Mr. Spacey as he channeled Mr. Carson.The show also had fun making note of this year\u2019s Oscar fiasco, when the wrong picture was announced for best film. After the accountants who tabulated the Tony votes were introduced, Mr. Spacey said to the audience, \u201cYou guys do not have to worry about them.\u201dIf one show stood out for much of the awards, it was \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201d In addition to the award for best musical, it was honored with best book of a musical and best score. Ben Platt, the show\u2019s male principal, was recognized as best lead actor in a musical.\u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d which has been playing to packed audiences since it opened last fall, has clearly spoken to a younger generation of theatergoers. It was a point that       Justin Paul,        one of the show\u2019s creators, referenced when he was honored, with his writing partner       Benj Pasek,        for best score.\u201cWe hoped to write a show where people looking for a home would find one,\u201d Mr. Paul said in his acceptance speech.The evening wasn\u2019t without surprises.       Danny DeVito,        who is well-known for his work in film and television, was heavily favored to win the Tony for best featured actor in a play for his performance in the revival of       Arthur Miller\u2019s       \u201cThe Price.\u201d But the honor went instead to       Michael Aronov       for his performance in \u201cOslo.\u201dPerhaps the most grateful award recipient was       Jane Greenwood,        who received the Tony for best costume design of a play for \u201cThe Little Foxes.\u201d Despite the fact Ms. Greenwood had been nominated 20 times previously, this marked her first victory.Politics also played its part in the course of the show. Some award presenters and recipients pointed to recent happenings in Washington, D.C. In particular, Mr. Colbert, who returned to present \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d with the award for best revival of a musical, spoke of the       Donald Trump       presidency as if it was a show unto itself.\u201cThis D.C. production is supposed to have a four-year run, but reviews have not been kind,\u201d Mr. Colbert said.\u2014Barbara Chai and Kathryn Lurie contributed to this article.Write to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-11 23:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tony-awards-honor-dear-evan-hansen-the-little-foxes-1497233889", "news_title": "Tony Awards Honor \u2018Dear Evan Hansen,\u2019 \u2018Oslo\u2019", "keywords": " evan hansen,hello dolly,jitney, kevin spacey, little foxes,oslo,tony awards, tonys,Benj Pasek,Danny DeVito,Justin Paul,Kevin Spacey,awards,political,general news,celebrities,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,music,theater,reviews"}, {"content": "The Pittsburgh Penguins topped the Nashville Predators 2-0 on Sunday night, ending hockey\u2019s fairy-tale story, igniting a controversy\u2014and ultimately winning the Stanley Cup.Game 6 remained scoreless until there was just 1:35 left in the third period, when the Penguins\u2019 Patric Hornqvist poked the puck past Predators goaltender Pekka Rinne. That goal was quickly followed up by an empty-netter to produce the final score.But the game may be remembered for the one goal that didn\u2019t end up on the scoreboard because of a controversial whistle that rung louder than any of Nashville\u2019s country music on Sunday night. During the play, Colton Sissons appeared to tap in a rebound to give the Predators a 1-0 lead. But a referee blew his whistle, seemingly believing that the puck was in the possession of Pittsburgh goaltender Matt Murray, only for replays to show that clearly was not the case.Now Pittsburgh has the makings of one of hockey\u2019s greatest dynasties in the sport\u2019s modern history. Many teams have produced spurts of titles over multiple years, but no team had ever won in consecutive years during the sport\u2019s salary cap era.The feat cements the legacy of Sidney Crosby, the superstar center with an impossible task: attempting to match the accomplishments of Pittsburgh legend Mario Lemieux.Few figures in any sport are revered the way Lemieux is in Pittsburgh. The team had never won the Stanley Cup before his arrival. Then the Penguins did twice in a row, in 1990 and 1991, with Lemieux winning the Conn Smythe trophy both times.Now Crosby has led his team to not just back-to-back titles, but his third overall with the team, also having won in 2009. And with key young pieces dotting Pittsburgh\u2019s roster, nobody would be stunned if a fourth didn\u2019t come sometime soon.Write to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Penguins Hoist the Cup, Again.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 23:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pittsburgh-penguins-win-the-stanley-cup-1497236758", "news_title": "Pittsburgh Penguins Win the Stanley Cup", "keywords": "nhl,pittsburgh penguins,stanley cup,Detroit Red Wings,Nashville Predators,Pittsburgh Penguins,ice hockey,sports,recreation,winter sports,routine general news"}, {"content": "The Pittsburgh Penguins are Stanley Cup champions for the second consecutive season after a 2-0 win over the Nashville Predators on Sunday.

And this year, perhaps, it may be especially true: The economy is firming up, interest rates are still relatively low and investment accounts are brimming.So consider this a reality check. Whether people are looking for a spot to enjoy themselves, rent to others or resell for a big profit, there are many mistakes that could bring them big headaches or cost them a lot of money.Experts and homeowners warn newbies, for instance, that they may end up putting in a lot more work than they expect\u2014and taking on a lot of frustration\u2014to keep renters happy. They can easily run afoul of rules laid down by local governments or homeowners\u2019 association, or find themselves facing unexpected costs. And there\u2019s no guarantee the rental or resale market will stay strong enough to justify the expense.\u201cCosts of owning and renting a vacation home can be very high,\u201d cautions longtime real-estate investor Todd Huettner, owner of Huettner Capital, a Denver real-estate lender. \u201cThe hassles and costs of short-term vacation rentals are higher than most people expect\u2026.People are way too optimistic about rent rates, vacancies, management fees, maintenance costs and home-value increases.\u201d Owners who live far away can also be surprised by climate-related issues like damaging snow loads in the mountains or corrosion from salt air at the beach, he says.Caveats aside, many people have already sealed a deal. After slumping in the years after the financial crisis, prices of vacation properties are back where they were in 2006, a National Association of Realtors survey found. The median sales price of a vacation home rose by 4.2% in 2016 to $200,000, following a 28% gain as the housing recovery gathered steam in 2015.And, of course, bad experiences aren\u2019t universal. Many who work hard enough at managing their vacation properties can\u2019t say enough good things about it.\u201cI bought a vacation home because Lake Tahoe was either too expensive to book for a last-minute weekend or I couldn\u2019t find any vacancies,\u201d says       Sabrina Robinson       of Santa Cruz, Calif., four hours from Tahoe. She says she rents her vacation condo to tourists year round, devotes about two hours a week to managing the property, mostly to deal with cleaners and renter inquiries, and covers her mortgage and utilities with about $20,000 in annual rental income. The homeowners\u2019 association does outside chores.But even those who are successful have to put in a lot of effort to make it work\u2014starting with careful thinking and planning before they take the plunge. Here are things potential buyers should consider, whether they are buying for pleasure, renting or as an investment.Buy it for the right reason. The Realtors association surveys find that the primary motivation for a vacation-home purchase is vacationing. And many experts think that\u2019s the best way to approach the deal. Rental income is so unpredictable it should be viewed as gravy, they say, and buyers certainly shouldn\u2019t rely on it to cover their mortgage and other expenses. And the market is too unpredictable to expect to profit on a sale.The approach with the fewest risks, many experts say, is for buyers to pick a place they will enjoy and focus on that as their top priority.\u201cOur buyers today are buying for a number of reasons, with the No. 1 reason being lifestyle and use,\u201d says Nick Cassini, senior vice president of sales and marketing for Four Seasons Private Residences in Anguilla.John Banczak,        executive chairman of Turnkey Vacation Rentals, a property-management company, says that people who buy as a lifestyle choice \u201care the people that realize they love spending time in one place, may even retire there, have done the research and made the decision a second home is for them. Getting additional revenue through rentals is the icing on the cake.\u201dPick a location that\u2019s good for business. Although rental income shouldn\u2019t be the top priority, it\u2019s still going to be crucial for many buyers. So as with all real estate, location is key.Sale prices and renter demand vary dramatically even within a given community, and not just because a beach-front property is going to be much more desirable than a property just a few blocks inland. For instance, a lot of construction may mean the location is hot\u2014or that a glut will depress rent rates and sales prices.\u201cThe owners that are most displeased are ones that rush the purchase decision because they are blinded by their dream,\u201d says       David Angotti,        co-founder of SmokyMountains.com, a vacation-rental listing site in Tennessee. \u201cFor example, they fail to understand location, view, features and other amenities are critical to the overall revenue, and just want a vacation home.\u201dAnother aspect of location to consider: how far the spot is from the owners. The National Association of Realtors says 57% of vacation properties are at the beach or lake, with the median distance 200 miles from home\u2014far enough to require spending money for a manager and caretaker. Little chores an owner would do himself or herself at home can thus get costly.\u201cIn our experience, living close is really helpful if something goes wrong, but there are a huge number of services out there to hold keys, offer concierge services or otherwise help if you live further away,\u201d says       Laura Hall,        communications director for Kid & Coe, a vacation-rental website. \u201cSo anything is possible if you\u2019re willing to pay for it.\u201dDon\u2019t delude yourself about costs and profits. Even if rental income is only a secondary goal of buying, pros urge a clear-eyed analysis of the expenses involved.Among the common rookie mistakes are focusing on purchase price, rental rates and recent market trends, and counting on more renters than are likely. Doing that means missing out on other crucial considerations that can eat away at earnings, such as costs for cleaning, management, routine maintenance and repairs. In some hot markets, homeowners-association charges can exceed $1,000 a month. Then there are real-estate taxes, insurance costs, utilities and perhaps state sales tax on rental income.The same holds true for buying a property with the intent to sell it. Experts warn that only a reckless buyer expects a vibrant market every year. From the end of 2007 through 2012, primary-home prices dropped by 14.8%, vacation properties by 23%, the Realtors\u2019 group says. Sales of vacation homes dropped in 2016 to 721,000, off 21.6% from the 920,000 in 2015. Mr. Cassini says there are fewer speculators in today\u2019s market compared with the prerecession boom.And, to underscore the risks, in 2016 foreclosures and short sales\u2014when the lender settles for less than owed\u2014accounted for 38% of vacation-property sales, compared with 9% for primary residences.Don\u2019t get tripped up by local rules. Local ordinances and homeowners-association rules can reduce the pool of potential renters. The association, for example, might ban pickups, motorcycles and pets, or mandate how much or how little time a property can be used for rental.Then there are government regulations that may limit an owner\u2019s flexibility. Will owners be able to ban college students planning to party on spring break? Possibly. But antidiscrimination laws limit whom they can say no to, forcing them to rent to guests they don\u2019t want, like people with rambunctious toddlers that can boost cleaning costs or annoy neighbors.Have a plan for getting renters. Finding, vetting and negotiating with renters is more work than many owners are willing to take on. So, many use a service to bring in business. But it\u2019s important that owners understand what these services involve before they sign up. Real-estate agents often charge 18% to 25% of the rent, and sometimes much more, usually deducted from rent passed to the owner. And their contracts may even require commissions on renters who owners find themselves. They provide damage insurance and bar renters who have posed problems for other owners.These days, many owners use online services like Airbnb, HomeAway and             TripAdvisor,       but this industry is no longer a simple subscription-based advertising service. These outlets, which usually charge on a sliding scale depending on the rent rate, are evolving into full-service operations: They not only handle renters\u2019 payments, but provide insurance to protect owners and automatically remind renters of payments due and return renters\u2019 damage deposits.Some listing services also dictate cancellation policies and other terms that many owners like to control themselves. And some listing sites withhold contact information from the owner and prospective renter until renter payments are received, to hinder off-site deals to avoid \u201cservice fees\u201d that can cost renters hundreds of dollars for a week-long stay.Watch out for tax traps. Federal tax rules offer deductions for mortgage interest, property tax, insurance premiums and many other expenses on second homes. But the rules are complex, and the biggest breaks generally go to owners who use the property no more than 14 days a year themselves, reducing benefits for owners who want to use their property heavily. And when it comes time to sell a rental, profits are likely to be taxed as long-term capital gains\u2014and not sheltered like profits from a primary home\u2014although many owners avoid that by converting a rental to a primary residence in retirement.Your renters may do more vacationing than you. Business and pleasure don\u2019t always mix, experienced landlords say. For maximum rental income, owners have to offer their properties during the peak summer or winter season, which may be when they want to use it themselves.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to essentially be competing with people interested in renting your home, then you aren\u2019t\u2026going to have much success,\u201d says       Adham Sbeih,        CEO of Socotra Capital, a real-estate investment and lending firm based in Sacramento. \u201cEven if you\u2019re only trying to use your home for a week or so out of every summer month, that can create enough conflicts that it significantly reduces your ability to consistently rent the property out.\u201dBrace yourself for tenant demands. Renters expect perfection and won\u2019t tolerate little annoyances that homeowners come to live with, like a balky ice maker or sticky door, and renters have no long-term stake in the property.\u201cExpect all the unexpected that arises when multiple people are rotating through the property and treat the property from the \u2018I\u2019m on vacation\u2019 mind-set,\u201d says Victoria Shtainer, an agent at the Compass real-estate firm in New York City who specializes in the Hamptons.There\u2019s also the question of guests who do things owners aren\u2019t anticipating.       Gail Lynne Goodwin,        owner of two luxury rentals in and near Montana\u2019s Glacier National Park, warns about things like \u201chaving a noisy guest that disturbs your neighbors, having a larger cleaning bill than anticipated, having a guest from Florida that wants to set the heat at 80 degrees, etc.\u201dAnd when owners use the property themselves, they may end up spending a lot of time with tenants on the brain. They may have to end their own visits emptying drawers, changing sheets, storing family photos and making trips to a storage unit with items they don\u2019t want renters to use, like bikes, kayaks or the family silver.So is buying a vacation rental a good idea? It can mean putting a lot of money at risk, more work than many buyers anticipate and headaches with renters. But those who have picked good properties in hot locations and have an ability to roll with the punches say they\u2019re happy.\u201cHaving a second home has been a dream come true and has also paid for itself,\u201d says Ms. Robinson, owner of the California vacation home.Mr. Brown is a writer in Livingston, Mont.

But companies are increasingly betting on another type of office perk for stressed-out employees: help with managing their financial lives.Some 59% of employers say they are very likely to focus on improving the financial well-being of their workers this year in ways that extend beyond retirement decisions, according to a recent survey by Aon Hewitt. That\u2019s a big jump from 30% of employers in 2014, the human-resources consulting firm says.A few years ago, employers mostly focused on encouraging employees to save in their 401(k)s and to select an appropriate asset allocation. Now, using a variety of approaches, from contests and cash incentives to offering apps for mobile devices, more employers are trying to teach employees financial basics such as debt reduction, and are offering more personalized coaching on financial matters.\u201cEmployers are broadening their scope and realizing that saving for retirement, while still very important, is only part of their workers\u2019 financial picture,\u201d says Rob Austin, director of research at Alight Solutions, the former benefits administration and human-resources outsourcing business of             Aon                   PLC.Several factors are fueling corporate interest in this concept, which is often presented to workers as \u201cfinancial wellness,\u201d experts say. Baby boomers are frequently looking for advice on how to make their money last in retirement; Generation X members can feel burdened by their financial obligations and added commitments to their parents and children; millennials, meanwhile, may be struggling to pay off their student loans.Such issues can leave workers distracted, stressed and less-productive. Employees with money worries may also be more hesitant to retire, have higher health-care costs and be more likely to leave for a competitor who offers them even slightly more money.More companies are seeing a connection between financial and physical health, says       Sarah Newcomb,        behavioral economist at HelloWallet, a             Morningstar Inc.       subsidiary that helps employees manage their paychecks and workplace benefits. Such companies fear that an employee who is stressed about money may be more likely to have high blood pressure or ulcers, and hence be distracted and have higher medical bills, Ms. Newcomb says.In light of such issues, employers are deciding that creating or expanding financial well-being programs is the \u201cright thing to do,\u201d according to the Aon Hewitt survey.Videogame company             Activision Blizzard Inc.       is taking steps to support the physical and financial health of its employees. The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company has a \u201chealthy incentive\u201d app that encourages its workers to track their physical activity and eat healthy. The app rewards employees for such behaviors by giving them cash for their health savings accounts, which can be spent on health-related expenses.The company also is piloting a program that offers a financial incentive for taking a mobile financial-wellness assessment. Additional benefits are earned when they engage with a financial-wellness coach and take steps such as refinancing a student loan at a lower interest rate, says       Milt Ezzard,        senior director of global benefits. In addition to earning cash toward their health savings accounts, employees can earn points that can be directed to raffles for prizes like a vacation, a wellness retreat or an annual gym membership.To help its employees reduce personal debt, Movement Mortgage LLC, a mortgage lender in Fort Mill, S.C., held a 90-day challenge during which it encouraged its roughly 3,100 employees to reduce their combined personal debt by $1 million. For each employee, the company provided a copy of author       Dave Ramsey\u2019s       \u201cThe Total Money Makeover\u201d and provided a free personal-financial assessment from Financial Finesse Inc., a firm that provides financial planning and education services in the workplace. Further training included six weeks of personal-finance education videos.After 90 days, 25% of the staff reported they had paid off a combined $2.8 million in consumer-credit debt and saved $1.4 million in emergency money. Ten employees got a $1,000 check payable to a creditor of choice.Some employers are extending financial-advice benefits to spouses and children as well. Some may give married employees an added financial benefit if both spouses meet with a financial planner, for example.John Hancock recently introduced a program called College Coach to help employees and their families navigate the college-admissions process.

Instead of sending a blanket message telling workers to save for retirement, employers may send high earners who are near retirement targeted messages about estate planning, says       Betsy Dill,        senior partner, financial wellness at consulting firm Mercer.\u201cFinancial wellness can be a highly customized experience,\u201d Ms. Dill says.Indeed, some apps are designed to link to the employee\u2019s checking account and can make observations based on the employee\u2019s spending. For example, if a worker has a large cellphone bill, the app may send him or her an email to remind them about the company\u2019s wireless discount program.To be sure, some employees may find such efforts by employers intrusive. They may also wish their employer would just give them a raise.But experts say they haven\u2019t seen employers mandate participation in these programs. They also say any data collected is typically managed by third parties and the employers have limited access to it.Workers\u2019 willingness to give their employers access to their personal financial information may vary by generation, some experts add.\u201cYounger people who may be more used to having the item they just searched for follow them around the internet may not find it creepy,\u201d says HelloWallet\u2019s Ms. Newcomb.Ms. Dagher is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York and host of the Watching Your Wealth podcast.

Many people are vulnerable to it. Are you? To find out, consider a few questions about a coin flip.Here\u2019s the first question, which the Nobel laureate       Paul Samuelson       first posed to one of his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: Would you accept a bet in which you win $200 if the coin lands on heads and lose $100 if lands on tails?Prof. Samuelson\u2019s colleague rejected this bet. Like many people, he felt that the potential pain of losing money wasn\u2019t worth the pleasure of the bigger gain.But here\u2019s a follow-up question: Do you want to play this same bet twice?When fellow behavioral economist       Richard Thaler       and I asked visitors to a coffee shop if they were interested in repeated plays of a similar bet, most people found the offer even less appealing. (The percentage of people accepting the wager dropped by 23 percentage points.) The logic is simple: They didn\u2019t really like the single bet, so why would they want to play it multiple times? It\u2019s like having an extra-large portion of a food you don\u2019t want to eat.Here\u2019s the last gambling question. You have a 25% chance of winning $400, a 50% chance of winning $100 and a 25% chance of losing $200. Would you accept this bet?If you\u2019re like most people, you find this wager more appealing.But here\u2019s the catch: This last gamble is the same as playing the coin flip twice. All I\u2019ve done is describe the overall odds. (There\u2019s a 25% chance of getting two heads, a 50% chance of getting one heads and one tails, and a 25% chance of getting two tails.) However, this new description more than doubles the number of coffee-shop visitors who wanted to take a similar gamble.What explains this preference reversal? Why does a new description make the same bet so much more appealing?This gets us back to the issue of narrow framing. If you initially rejected the bets, it\u2019s probably because you are still thinking about each coin flip independently, fixated on the 50% chance of losing money. However, when the overall odds are aggregated for you, it\u2019s much easier to see that the gamble is quite attractive.For investors, such narrow framing can lead to some serious mistakes and missed opportunities.The first mistake involves people taking too little risk, which often leads to lower investment returns. When we engage in narrow framing, we tend to focus on short-term losses, much like those people asked about coin flips. Instead of considering how the investment fits with our long-term goals\u2014for example, comfortable retirement\u2014we get scared by the daily swings of the market. As a result, we keep our money in a bank account earning just 0.15% or so a year. (If your money earns 0.15% a year, it will take almost 500 years to double.)The second mistake involves people taking on too much risk without realizing it. When we don\u2019t think about our entire portfolio, it\u2019s easy to overlook the fact that many of our different investments might fall or fail for similar reasons. It can be smart to have some risky investments in a portfolio, but you want to make sure that all of the risks are considered together. If a lot of your wealth is tied up in your house, then you probably want to think twice about investing your IRA in a local apartment building.The good news is that there are some simple steps you can take to minimize the potential problems caused by narrow framing.The easiest way to achieve your long-term goals, and avoid focusing on short-term losses, is to check your portfolio less often. While it\u2019s now possible to get instant updates on the latest swings of the market, this additional information can lead to narrow framing. For instance, if those subjects offered multiple coin flips were simply told about the outcome after all rounds, and not after every flip, they would find the wager more appealing. The same goes for the stock market: Less-frequent updates can lead to smarter choices.In the near future, I hope that our gadgets get smarter about how they deliver our financial information as a way to overcome narrow framing. For instance, if your wearable notices a correlation between market swings and reduced sleep, then perhaps it should adjust the frequency of feedback. Maybe the default setting on the stocks app should switch to monthly rather than real-time.Another important way to reduce narrow framing is to aggregate our financial accounts. Many American workers have multiple investment and retirement accounts, spread across different firms. (This is often a consequence of people changing jobs.) The problem with having so many different accounts is that it can make it harder for us to think holistically about our finances and properly assess our overall risk exposure.In the past, fixing this issue was extremely time consuming, and required people to manually merge all of their accounts. However, aggregation software can now make it easy to display the information from these different accounts in one place. The accounts themselves might still be held at different financial institutions, but the software encourages us to think more broadly about our investment decisions.The larger lesson is that aggregation can help us avoid the trap of narrow framing. Like those subjects given aggregated odds about the coin flips, one of the keys to making better financial decisions is to rely on information that reflects the biggest possible picture.This is what the best investors do: They seek out the big picture. And then, once they\u2019ve found it, they remember not to look at it too often.Dr. Benartzi, a frequent contributor to the Journal Reports, is a professor and co-head of the behavioral decision-making group at the UCLA Anderson School of Management and author of \u201cThe Smarter Screen\u201d about online behavior.

But some new programs\u2014from mortgage-market giant Fannie Mae, as well as from a handful of states\u2014aim to make that easier.College graduates with student debt are less likely to buy a home than graduates without debt, according to a recent study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For starters, paying off student loans can make it more difficult to save enough cash for a down payment. Then, even if potential home buyers have saved enough to put down, student loans affect their debt-to-income ratio, which can make it difficult for them to qualify for a mortgage.On top of that, many young people don\u2019t even want to think about taking on more debt, even if they could afford it.\u201cThere are definitely a group of consumers that haven\u2019t even tried to apply for a mortgage or figure out what they can afford because of the anxiety of their student-loan debt hanging over them,\u201d says       Betsy Mayotte,        director of consumer outreach and compliance for the Center for Consumer Advocacy at American Student Assistance, a nonprofit focused on helping students make better decisions about higher education and student debt.The new programs, and some that have been in place for years, can help. But       Mark Kantrowitz,        the publisher of Cappex.com, a college and scholarship search site, warns that they\u2019re not right for everyone. In many cases, these initiatives help borrowers who are at the edge of affordability, which means they should probably think twice before taking on a mortgage, he says. \u201cI know it\u2019s the American dream that everybody wants to own a house,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s going to tie you down both physically and financially\u201d and for some people \u201cit doesn\u2019t make good financial sense to take on so much debt.\u201dWith that caution in mind, here\u2019s a look at some of the programs that are available.Fannie Mae announced new policies in April aimed at helping student-loan borrowers manage their debt and, in some cases, qualify for a mortgage.\u201cWithout a doubt, when we asked our lenders where are you facing challenges with providing access to credit, the answer we always get back is people with student debt,\u201d says       Jonathan Lawless,        vice president for product development and affordable housing at Fannie Mae.The first initiative helps borrowers who already own a home to convert their student debt into housing debt that carries a lower interest rate. Borrowers can refinance their mortgage through lenders backed by Fannie Mae to pull some equity out of their home to pay off student loans. The rate on the refinancing is lower than what is typically available, Fannie Mae says, in part because borrowers don\u2019t have to pay the additional fees that lenders usually charge for such so-called cash-out refinancings.Anyone can take advantage of this program, even if they don\u2019t have student loans, as long as they\u2019re using the money to pay down student debt. For example, a parent, grandparent or even a stranger could pull equity out of their home to pay down someone else\u2019s student loans.Parent and grandparent assistance is rewarded in other ways, too, through Fannie Mae\u2019s new initiatives. The agency will no longer consider student loans, credit-card debt or car loans paid by someone other than the student over the past 12 months in the debt-to-income ratio of a borrower looking to qualify for a mortgage.Finally, a change that has the potential to affect a large and likely growing group of borrowers allows lenders to change the way they calculate consumers\u2019 debt-to-income ratios. Previously, lenders backed by Fannie Mae were required to assume mortgage applicants\u2019 monthly student-loan payments were at least 1% of their loan balance. Now, lenders can consider borrowers\u2019 actual student-loan payments\u2014which may be lower than 1% of the balance in many cases because of the rapid growth in the use of programs that allow people with federal student loans to make payments based on their income, rather than the standard 10-year repayment plan.Borrowers looking to swap their student debt for mortgage debt should shop around first, Mr. Kantrowitz says. If borrowers with federal student loans pay off that debt with a mortgage refinancing, they will be giving up protections guaranteed by the government such as the ability to pay off the debt according to income and to pause payments in times of economic distress. What\u2019s more, their home suddenly becomes collateral for the debt and can be taken away in the event of default. If borrowers are looking for a better interest rate than they have on their student loans and are willing to give up protections offered through the federal student-loan program, they may want to consider a private lender that refinances student loans instead, Mr. Kantrowitz says.The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development launched its Maryland SmartBuy program last fall. Through the program, the state provides a second mortgage up to 15% of a home\u2019s purchase price in the form of a zero-interest mortgage loan, with no monthly payments, to be put toward paying off the buyer\u2019s student debt.To qualify, borrowers must have at least $1,000 in student debt, be current on their student-loan payments and be able to pay off the debt entirely at the time of the home purchase. Borrowers also need to be able to afford to put down 5% of the home\u2019s purchase price, and the home must be one of the state-owned properties reserved for the program.The state forgives 20% of the mortgage loan each year the buyer remains in the home. That means buyers who stay in a home for five years have their student debt wiped out at no cost.As of June 7, 22 homes are either under contract or have sold through the program, officials say.By the time       Eric Harris       stumbled upon a listing for a SmartBuy house in November, he had already been looking for a house for five months and was struggling to close a deal in a competitive market where buyers would make all-cash offers in some cases. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can compete with that,\u201d says Mr. Harris.But because the eligibility requirements for the SmartBuy program narrowed the competition, he was quickly able to secure the home. \u201cThis program really made it easy for me to go in there and not have to worry about several other different offers and contracts potentially beating mine out,\u201d he says. Mr. Harris, a 25-year-old web developer, paid off $6,398 in student debt through the program.Craig Renner,        the special program administrator for SmartBuy, says it is an economic-development opportunity for the state. \u201cIt helps protect and foster property values in a given neighborhood\u201d and it \u201chelps make Maryland an attractive place for millennials to come start families and start businesses.\u201dNew York last month launched its Graduate to Homeownership program, which offers subsidized mortgages and up to $15,000 in down-payment assistance to recent graduates who buy homes in one of several upstate cities that are part of a statewide downtown-revitalization program.To qualify, potential home buyers need to have graduated with an associate\u2019s, bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s or doctoral degree within the past 48 months, have good credit and be steadily employed. The program also has income and home-price limits.The program, which is administered by the State of New York Mortgage Agency, builds on other efforts by the state to support college students and recent graduates, like the tuition-free program for some students at the state\u2019s public colleges, signed into law earlier this year, says       RuthAnne Visnauskas,        commissioner of New York State Homes and Community Renewal. It also serves to boost the communities and businesses in the areas where young people are encouraged to buy homes, she says.\u201cWe want to keep all these smart kids that are coming out of New York state colleges and universities in New York,\u201d says Ms. Visnauskas.Ohio has a more established program. The Ohio Housing Finance Agency launched an initiative in 2009 called Grants for Grads, which provides down-payment assistance and a discounted mortgage interest rate to recent college graduates who purchase homes in the state.To qualify, prospective buyers need to be a first-time home buyer, have graduated with an associate\u2019s, bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, doctoral or other postgraduate degree from an accredited college or university within the past two years and have a credit score of at least 640. The program also has income and home-price limits that vary by region. For example, residents looking to purchase a home in Franklin County, where Columbus is located, can\u2019t have an income of more than $83,000 for a family of one or two people and can\u2019t buy a home that costs more than $365,000, says       Molly Moses,        the finance agency\u2019s director of communications and marketing.These kinds of programs can help young adults get over the perception that they\u2019re not homebuying material, says Ms. Moses. \u201cWe think that a lot of people in this demographic may shy away from home buying or think it\u2019s not a possibility because they\u2019ve got so much of that debt and the payments are so high that they can\u2019t even save for a down payment,\u201d she says. \u201cHomeownership is not even on their radar.\u201dIt appears the program is helping address that problem. People used it to buy 408 homes in 2016, up from 159 in 2010. \u201cWe want people to understand that homeownership is not just for the elite or the wealthy,\u201d Ms. Moses says.Ms. Berman is a reporter for MarketWatch.

Chris Christie       moved to seize control of this cash-strapped coastal city, property taxes are down and municipal bankruptcy no longer poses an immediate threat.But the recent successes haven\u2019t alleviated many Atlantic City residents and officials\u2019 anger at the governor over the state\u2019s intervention, which has led to pay cuts for police and firefighters and deepened concerns about local control. The city\u2019s mild-mannered mayor, a Republican, refers to the governor\u2019s upcoming departure from office as \u201cliberation day.\u201d\u201cThis could have been done without all of this infighting,\u201d said Mayor Don Guardian. \u201cI don\u2019t think a takeover was necessary.\u201dOnce flush with casino cash from a longtime monopoly on East Coast gambling, Atlantic City has slipped into economic and fiscal crisis over the past decade. Five Atlantic City casinos have closed since 2014, largely due to competition from new gaming halls in neighboring states, decimating the local tax base and straining the city\u2019s bloated budget.Under the state\u2019s oversight, Atlantic City saved about $90 million by settling a huge property-tax appeal with its biggest casino, secured a commitment from Hard Rock International to open a location in the former Trump Taj Mahal and cut residents\u2019 property taxes by 5%.Mr. Christie, at a June 1 press conference in Trenton, said the state\u2019s intervention has encouraged investment from private business owners. \u201cThey want stability and sanity in local government,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had neither in Atlantic City, and now they do.\u201dA key component of the state\u2019s intervention involves significant changes to the city\u2019s police and fire collective-bargaining contracts. In March, the state unilaterally implemented salary, benefits and overtime cuts, elongated work schedules and reduced worker-compensation coverage. The changes are expected to save $34 million this year, a state spokeswoman said.The state also moved to lay off about 100 firefighters as well as 19 police officers. The unions sued, and a state Superior Court judge temporarily blocked the layoffs but allowed the other changes to proceed.The fire department\u2019s union has appealed the state\u2019s actions and is scheduled to appear in court again later this month. Union President Bill Dilorenzo said the pay cuts took effect four weeks ago.\u201cThe schedule change together with the pay cut, you\u2019re looking at your hourly rate being decreased by almost 50%,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating.\u201dA state spokeswoman said \u201cshared sacrifice by all stakeholders, including firefighters,\u201d is necessary to return the city to financial stability.Mr. Christie, who is prevented by term limits from running for re-election, has a complicated legacy in Atlantic City. After his initial plan to revitalize the city floundered, the governor appointed an emergency manager and eventually called for a full takeover of the city\u2019s finances and operations.Atlantic City officials have long resented what they saw as Mr. Christie\u2019s heavy-handed interventions, and they were backed by some state lawmakers as they resisted his takeover attempt last year. But the governor refused to sign legislation to deliver critically needed funding to the city unless state lawmakers gave him control of the city, sparking a bitter, monthslong standoff that the governor eventually won.In November, the state appointed       Jeffrey Chiesa,        the governor\u2019s friend and former chief counsel, to oversee the city.Atlantic City officials have criticized the cost of hiring with Mr. Chiesa, now a private attorney whose firm has so far billed the state more than $1 million for six months of work in the city. The New Jersey Department of Community Affairs declined to make Mr. Chiesa available for an interview.Atlantic City\u2019s future is still unsettled, with parts of the state\u2019s intervention tied up in court, the local economy still dependent on gaming and several new potentially costly tax appeals pending from casino owner       Carl Icahn.Linda Steele,        the former president of Atlantic City\u2019s NAACP chapter, said she would like to see the state publicly outline its future plans for the city, including when the intervention will end.\u201cThe people in Atlantic City are still against the takeover,\u201d Ms. Steele said.Marc Pfeiffer,        assistant director of the Bloustein Local Government Research Center at Rutgers University, said the state takeover was necessary.\u201cThings were not being resolved on their own,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would not see the improvements that we\u2019ve seen without the takeover.\u201dMoody\u2019s Investors Service issued a May report on Atlantic City that kept the city\u2019s general-obligation bond rating at Caa3 but revised the outlook to positive from negative. The ratings company believes the state intervention has had a positive effect on the city, but it remains concerned about the city\u2019s continued reliance on the casino industry and high debt burden.\u201cAlthough they\u2019ve taken some positive steps, they still have a great deal of work that remains to be done,\u201d said Douglas Goldmacher, a Moody\u2019s analyst.Mr. Guardian acknowledged that the city has received much-needed financial assistance from Mr. Christie\u2019s administration but said that many of the changes the state has implemented were in the works beforehand. He said he still believes the state takeover unconstitutionally violates local sovereignty.\u201cThey don\u2019t live here,\u201d Mr. Guardian said, referring to Mr. Chiesa and the state officials overseeing Atlantic City. \u201cThey don\u2019t hear the angst of the residents about losing their jobs, about the taxes, about the conditions of their families.

Didn\u2019t we just leave tax season a couple of months ago?That isn\u2019t a smart way to approach a subject as complex as taxes. Getting an early start now will save a lot of headaches later\u2014making it more likely that you\u2019ll reduce your chances of overlooking lucrative breaks, making careless errors or paying more than required.It won\u2019t be easy, though. Tax planning can be especially tricky right now because nobody knows what, if any, changes will be enacted this year, or what the effective dates will be. Although many lawmakers are talking about passing the biggest tax overhaul since 1986, opinion is sharply divided on what those changes might be\u2014or if Congress will pass anything, for that matter. \u201cThere are a lot of unknown moving parts,\u201d says       Greg Rosica,        a tax partner at Ernst & Young in Tampa, Fla., and a contributing author to the EY Tax Guide.Despite the difficulty of knowing what lies ahead, here are a few steps that tax experts say are likely to look smart even if Congress does nothing.Withholding: Many taxpayers may benefit by taking a fresh look at how much they pay this year through withholding, estimated taxes, or both. Most people pay too much and get refunds. Instead, consider trimming those payments and freeing up that money to spend, invest or reduce debt. One particularly smart move would be to pay down high-cost credit-card debt. (The next estimated-tax deadline is June 15.)Through June 2, the Internal Revenue Service reported about 104.9 million refunds, or just over three-quarters of all the returns processed by that date. Average refund: $2,769, up 1.2% from the comparable period last year.Some people look forward to getting a big refund each year because they view it as forced savings. One friend told me he deliberately arranged to get extra-large refunds for several years because he assumed his ex-spouse wouldn\u2019t find out and try to claim a share. Whatever the case, remember the Treasury doesn\u2019t pay interest on routine refunds.\u201cSit down now and do a projection of what your tax situation is going to look like for the year,\u201d says Mr. Rosica. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have too little withheld and get hit with penalties, or have way too much withheld and leave your money with the government earning nothing.\u201dYour withholding also may need altering because of major life changes, such as getting married or divorced, or a death in the family. Tax-preparation software can help with the number crunching. The IRS offers an online withholding calculator at irs.gov.Here\u2019s another reason to revisit this topic: Tax-ID theft, or tax-refund fraud, is still a major headache for many taxpayers. In a typical case, someone steals your Social Security number and files a tax return claiming a fraudulent refund. Victims typically don\u2019t discover the problem until later. \u201cYou may be unaware that this has happened until you efile your return and discover that a return already has been filed using your SSN,\u201d the IRS says on its website. \u201cOr, the IRS may send you a letter saying we have identified a suspicious return using your SSN.\u201dIt can take many months to fix the problem. That can be especially painful for victims counting on getting big refunds to pay urgent bills. As my colleague Laura Saunders wrote earlier this year: If you tweak your estimated tax payments, withholding, or both, in order to get a smaller refund or even a small tax-due amount, \u201cthere will be less pain if you\u2019re a victim.\u201dProcrastinators: Earlier this year, the IRS received about 13.7 million filing-extension forms, up 6.5% from the prior year. That extended the filing deadline for most of these people until Monday, Oct. 16\u2014although they had to pay any tax due by the April deadline to avoid interest and penalties. If you plan to claim deductions for charitable donations, make sure you have proper acknowledgments for those gifts. Some charities may need nudging\u2014and even some coaching. The record-keeping rules vary depending on the amount and type of donation.For example, if you gave a charity $250 or more, make sure the charity sent you a \u201ccontemporaneous written acknowledgment\u201d with all the required details. That includes whether or not you got something in return, such as sporting-event tickets. If you didn\u2019t get anything in return\u2014other than what IRS Publication 526 refers to as \u201ccertain token items and membership benefits\u201d\u2014be sure the acknowledgment specifically says so. Some charities seem unaware of this rule and neglect to include the required language. (However, if the only thing you got was an \u201cintangible religious benefit,\u201d such as admission to a religious ceremony, the statement should say so but doesn\u2019t need to estimate the value.)If you did get something significant in return, the receipt is supposed to describe it and estimate its value. You can\u2019t deduct the part of your gift representing that value. Be sure you have the required acknowledgments before filing your return, says       Martin Hall,        a tax lawyer at Ropes & Gray LLP in Boston.Philanthropy: Many taxpayers 70\u00bd or older should consider taking advantage of a law designed to encourage charitable giving. This law generally allows them to transfer as much as $100,000 a year to qualified charities directly from an individual retirement account without having to count any of that transfer as income. The transfer counts toward the taxpayer\u2019s required minimum distribution from the IRA for that year.Some friends have asked whether this provision expired. No, says Mr. Rosica: Congress has made this law \u201cpermanent, although we use that word a little loosely these days.\u201dWhile these transfers are tax-free, they aren\u2019t tax-deductible, but they can still be highly advantageous for many people. Some charities aren\u2019t eligible. \u201cFor example, donor-advised funds and supporting organizations are not eligible recipients,\u201d the IRS says on its website.Rent your home: If you are searching for some tax-free income, consider renting out your home for 14 days or less during the year. That may sound surprising, since the general rule is that rental income typically must be included in your income. But here is how the IRS explains this important exception in Publication 527: \u201cIf you rent property that you also use as your home and you rent it less than 15 days during the tax year, do not include the rent you receive in your income\u2026.\u201d Just be sure to have excellent documentation\u2014and don\u2019t exceed 14 days. If you rent your home for 15 days or more during the year, include all of that rental income in your income. See Publication 527 for more details.Natural Disasters: Logic would suggest that casualty losses are deductible for the year in which the event occurred. That\u2019s generally true. But there is a special option for taxpayers with casualty losses from hurricanes, severe storms, flooding and other catastrophes that occurred in a federally declared disaster area. They can claim those losses either on their return for the year in which the event actually occurred or on the return for the preceding tax year. IRS Publication 547 has more on this topic.Mr. Herman is a writer in New York City. He was formerly The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Tax Report columnist.

In The Wall Street Journal\u2019s last Wealth Management Report, I wrote about the realities of our itinerant life, the sacrifices involved, and some of the benefits we\u2019ve enjoyed.As I wrote in the piece: \u201cOur life is a choice like any other, with advantages and disadvantages. We\u2019ve sacrificed some things (like family, better-paying jobs, security and a sense of belonging) for others (like freedom of movement, and the chance to discover more about the world and our place in it). Now in our early 40s, we are privileged to be able to make this choice. But still, it is a choice, and it\u2019s one that I don\u2019t believe many people would make, even given the opportunity.\u201dHundreds of readers responded with their own inspiring stories, touching memories and practical advice.Below are edited excerpts of some of the comments and emails\u2014including arguments for the benefits of family and a more settled life, an anecdote about 1970s Yugoslavia, a proposal for a policy of \u201cmidlife retirement,\u201d and much more.My mantra has always been, \u201cIf we want world peace, we all have to go out and meet each other.\u201d \u2026I am an 84-year-old broad who has spent her life raising three wonderful children, learning all the hard lessons along the way. No one can ever understand the joy of conversing with an Arab bus driver with no common language; seeing with my own eyes rather than a paper photograph the Alps, the Greeks on the streets of Athens. My bed is firm in one spot now, and I enjoy the memories that no one else can understand. Keep going!\u2014Elsa MannYou sound like you are happy so good for you. Way too many of us are not and are tied to jobs we hate. I take a road trip every year with no rigid itinerary. I sleep most nights in the back of my 4x4 SUV and love it. It has enabled me to see North America\u2019s most hidden sights, and when the trips end, I feel totally deflated until the next one begins.\u2014John DillNice gig I suppose. But if one has a real, productive, responsible job, this would not be possible. And if all people took this to heart, where would we all be?\u2014Douglas BergIf you missed parts of Poland or Sweden, you can always go back in your early 60s. Not so if you decide to have children later.I can tell you that the joys of children and grandchildren cannot be explained in a 35,000,000-word article. Been to 42 amazing countries and many interesting experiences, but none that will ever match hearing the words \u201cThanks Dad\u201d or \u201cI love you pop pop!\u201d A little wisdom from an old guy in Virginia.\u2014Dennis ByrneYou two are just getting your toes in the water. I travel full time and am just finishing up year six.You can keep going forever, but my advice would be to lose the car. I\u2019m a Texan and it was easier to do without than I ever imagined. In most countries, autos are a burden. It cuts your costs quite nicely.Also, don\u2019t overlook Mexico and Colombia, good infrastructure and superb cultures. Asia as well. All quite economical. And hostels can be good finds too sometimes. Don\u2019t dismiss them out of hand.\u2014David HaglerI hope to take some time to live like this with my husband. To that end, I am slowly getting rid of stuff, unbeknownst to him. Maybe one day, when he comes home and there is nothing left in the house, he will be ready to leave!\u2014Katie ColburnMy wife and I chose a slightly different path: We worked hard and then \u201cretired\u201d at about 45. But as we were both consultants, our clients have doggedly refused to give us up and so we have a trickle of money working about eight hours a week that supplements our savings. Our current travel project is trying to see all of Italy via motor scooter.\u2014Joel SnyderSomeone decides how you\u2019ll live life; why not you? Choices are choices; the selected necessitates the unselected. Think of people we\u2019ve all known who can\u2019t choose, making life\u2019s worst choice, committing to nothing.An observation: I\u2019m aware of people, mostly military or diplomatic, who never rooted, never had to, and when retired, settling somewhere, struggled to adapt. There are disparate social skills. Surviving itinerantly demands some talent at presenting compelling enough explanations for oneself. If the Blackmans are ordinary people, they\u2019ve refined this skill. It risks becoming their Frodo\u2019s ring.When the inevitable comes and they must settle, they\u2019re in for some hard adjustments.\u2014Michael DonohoI have always dreamt of this type of travel but got caught up in life. Your article took me back to my childhood when all these dreams existed. As I read about your experiences and adventures, it touched my soul.\u2014Leslie DalyI totally understand why your lifestyle is attractive to you, and good for you and your wife for following your dreams. I personally could never sacrifice, nor would I feel comfortable asking my family to sacrifice the time lost on holidays and special occasions. Life is fleeting, and the people that you care about are gone way too soon.\u2014Catherine WilliamsI find myself questioning the ever-tiring corporate void on a daily basis. You\u2019re living life as so many of us should, with a zest for learning and seeing new places. You cannot replace the copious amounts of culture you\u2019ve encountered with a stash of cash.\u2014DaneYour words incurred a flare-up of my chronic bug and lent me some creative juices that I hope will bring some new flavor to my daydreams of traveling long-term again. Thank you for bringing an even approach to the article and not romanticizing a lifestyle. I agree with the cost of a wandering life, but for some such as Genie and yourself, it\u2019s clear the freedom has been worth it. I hope to one day follow in your path. Continue to trail blaze and be an ambassador not only for your culture but also to it; young people like myself could benefit to hear of choices in life beyond what their next career move should be.\u2014Cameron GriffinFor a lot of people, this sort of life just is not practical. But it does bring to mind an idea: Why can\u2019t there be some sort of \u201cmidlife retirement\u201d? What I am envisioning is that every American who has paid some certain minimum into Social Security for at least 15 years would be entitled to enjoy a two-year \u201cmidlife retirement\u201d to be taken some time between the ages of 40 and 49, during which he or she would enjoy full Social Security benefits. Afterward, they are guaranteed their job back in much the same way as the Family and Medical Leave Act. Then, their eventual \u201cfinal retirement\u201d is delayed by two years.\u2014Andrew KennellyIt is so exciting to read about the free spirits in the world who go against the common grain to seek adventure and experience in their lives. It is not a life my husband and I would entertain, but I find it so exhilarating to envision through your eyes the learning you have gone through.\u2014Channe MascoloTwo years ago, my husband and I quit our jobs in New York and traveled around the world. I learned I didn\u2019t need anything other than what was in my bag, and when I came back to my apartment in New York, I couldn\u2019t fathom what to do with everything I had in storage.Right now, finally getting my dream job and a nice salary are my consolation prize for being back in this world. But I am constantly thinking about when we\u2019ll next be on the road, without a plan, without a schedule, without a mortgage and furniture and a job and languages we understand and people we know.Your words brought me back to my happy place two years ago, driving on the back roads of New Zealand\u2019s South Island, sitting on my own private sandbar in Tonga, working on a sheep farm in Mallorca, living in our rented Paris apartment for a month, traveling across Bolivia in a dusty 4x4 with six strangers who soon became (and still are) friends.\u2014Denise RehrigMr. Blackman\u2019s article reminds me of a similar experience my then-husband and I had in 1972. We ordered a Fiat which we picked up in Geneva and loosely followed an itinerary which took us everywhere in Europe except Finland and Ireland. Friends sometimes met us for a week at a time. When we liked a place, we stayed.One miserably hot August day, we were sitting in an outdoor cafe in Vienna. A nearby group was headed for Yugoslavia, excited about the beaches. That day we \u201csplit for Split.\u201d The marriage did not last, but the memories are forever.\u2014Ann S. MacdonaldAt 59 and free to travel, I find it fun and exciting, but I always enjoy coming home\u2026even for a week.\u2014Mike StimolaMy wife and I have just embarked on a similar lifestyle; we sold our house in the U.S.A., placed all of our possessions in a storage unit, and now have no fixed address. We\u2019re currently in Medell\u00edn and in a few weeks will head for the U.K. It has been both exhilarating and daunting, a bit like jumping out of an airplane, hoping you\u2019ve packed your parachute correctly. We\u2019ve prepared thoroughly, yet I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019ve missed something really important.For me, the most difficult part has been simply getting my life in order: changing addresses, scanning important documents, updating all of our accounts, etc. Also we have to learn how to time our travels so as not to overstay our welcome (thanks, Schengen Group).\u2014Jeff HelminiakWhat is life about, if not experiences and connections with people, especially when they are new and outside of our normal circles? I hope I am able to do something similar after I quit my \u201ccorporate\u201d job but while my health is still good. To each his own, but to me, the saddest people are those who never leave their comfort zones and live a life of very little variety. And there are many of those out there.\u2014Kelly LonsberryIn the mid-1980s, when I was in my early 30s, my wife, 7-year-old daughter and I spent 18 months traveling throughout Europe in a VW bus. We later went to India for three months and then returned for more time in the U.K. and Crete.While I eventually returned to a more conventional life as a journalist, that period of my life stands out as one of unusual discovery and an opportunity to see life differently. Thanks for reminding me why it was so special.\u2014Ed SmithI am 71 years young and retired but think nothing of taking a trip across America or flying to Central America when I find great deals online. Always have friends ready to go with me. If I drive, many times I either find a deal to stay at night online or coupons from booklets located at interstate rest stops. You often meet great people that have a story to tell you. I often think that everyone on this Earth has a great story to tell and is in search of someone to listen.\u2014Jim StephensI thoroughly enjoyed your article describing what traveling for an extended period of time is really like. My husband and I are about to embark on a similar adventure\u2014quitting our jobs and traveling for 12-18 months.

Deposits in the Roth account are after-tax, so the savings grow tax-free. With traditional 401(k)s, by contrast, account holders get to deduct their contributions from their income, but taxes are due when those funds are withdrawn, usually during retirement and at a lower tax rate because the saver is no longer working.Both accounts have their advantages. But when researchers at Harvard Business School looked at Roth 401(k) accounts across a range of industries at companies with 10,000 or more employees, they found that savers using Roths ended up ahead. The reasons were surprising.We asked the lead author of the forthcoming study,       John Beshears,        a behavioral economist and assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, to explain. Edited excerpts of the interview follow.WSJ: What did you find for people who used the Roth 401(k) option, compared with those who used the traditional 401(k)?MR. BESHEARS: What we found is that people didn\u2019t save any differently, in the sense that they still had the same total contribution rate. But with the Roth 401(k), that actually translates into more purchasing power in retirement.WSJ: Why is that?MR. BESHEARS: The American tax system is extremely complicated. People very reasonably use rules of thumb to guide their financial decisions, especially in the face of complexity. Some common rules of thumb for saving in a 401(k) are to contribute the amount necessary to earn the maximum employer matching contribution, or to contribute the maximum amount allowed in the plan. Another ubiquitous suggestion is to save 10% of pretax income. If they switch over into a Roth and do not adjust their rule of thumb, they\u2019re in effect saving more.WSJ: Walk us through that.MR. BESHEARS: It feels like you\u2019re following the same rule\u2014I\u2019m saving 10%. But it makes a big difference if you\u2019re doing it in the traditional 401(k) or the Roth.In the case of the traditional 401(k), taxes are still due when you withdraw money in retirement. In fact, you are probably in a lower tax bracket in retirement, so you pay taxes at a lower rate than when you were working. In a sense, you could have put more money in the account back when you were working to cover future taxes, but you didn\u2019t because no one does that if they\u2019re following a rule of thumb.But in the case of the Roth 401(k), the whole amount is yours in retirement. You could have put in less money back then because you had to pay taxes due at that time, but you didn\u2019t, again because of the rule of thumb. The Roth fund is worth more because every single dollar in the account can be withdrawn tax-free.WSJ: So what kind of difference are we talking about, come retirement?MR. BESHEARS: If a worker saves $5,000 a year in a 401(k) for 40 years and earns 5% return a year, the final balance will be more than $600,000. If the 401(k) is a Roth, the full balance is available for retirement spending. If the 401(k) is a traditional one, taxes are due on the balance. Let\u2019s say the person\u2019s tax rate is 20% in retirement. That makes for a difference of $120,000 in spending power, which a life annuity will translate into about $700 a month in extra spending.WSJ: So investors are almost accidentally saving more on a Roth 401(k) by keeping round numbers to meet their rule-of-thumb goal.MR. BESHEARS: Indeed, it\u2019s just a difference of whether you\u2019re paying your taxes now or later. With the Roth 401(k), you\u2019re paying the taxes now. You\u2019re sacrificing today for more spending power in retirement.WSJ: Do you recommend the Roth 401(k) over the traditional pretax option?MR. BESHEARS: That\u2019s a more complicated question, whether people should use it. We studied what happened when they do use it. We\u2019re not recommending the Roth 401(k) necessarily, but it does seem conducive to increased savings.WSJ: Do your findings on Roth vs. traditional 401(k)s apply to Roth IRAs vs. traditional IRAs as well?MR. BESHEARS: They absolutely translate.If people have a rule of thumb for the number of dollars they put into these savings vehicles, the exact same implications follow.Ms. Gallegos is a news editor for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

But new research suggests that women have more to gain than men by postponing retirement and putting off Social Security claims.That\u2019s because women often have more years of low income\u2014or no income\u2014to make up for with higher earnings in their later years in order to boost their monthly Social Security payments.Social Security payments are based on workers\u2019 highest 35 years of wages, adjusted for inflation. A study by Boston College\u2019s Center for Retirement Research found women are about three times more likely than men to have a zero-earnings year at some point in those 35 years.Nearly half of all women are in this position. They may have chosen to extend their education, raise children or care for elders, according to the study\u2019s author,       Matthew S. Rutledge,        a research economist at Boston College. And the closer a woman is to retirement when her income drops, the bigger the impact may be, because the last years of a working life tend to be among the highest-earning years.Diane Doyle Strobel       left her job at age 61 after her husband, Dennis, was admitted to hospice care. After a long career in hospital administration in Louisville, Ky., she had just been promoted to a management position with statewide oversight.Ms. Doyle made a calculated gamble, thinking she\u2019d be sidelined for six to 10 months, weighing the financial loss against other income and savings. Three years later, her husband is still alive, in the final stages of a progressive dementia. Ms. Doyle hasn\u2019t returned to her hospital job.As a result, just as her earning power was hitting its highest level, Ms. Strobel\u2019s income took a plunge. For the past three years she has drawn only a minimal wage from a family-owned insurance business.In addition, Ms. Strobel began collecting Social Security two years ago when she turned 62\u2014much earlier than she had planned. So her payments were reduced both by the decline in her income and by her not waiting longer to start receiving benefits. She says she wishes she could have done more to protect her retirement security, including finding a less stressful job that would have given her the time to care for her husband and kept her income from falling so low.Women who don\u2019t have 35 strong earnings years, Mr. Rutledge says, should consider working longer, even part-time.It doesn\u2019t take much additional work to make a big difference in Social Security payments. The Boston College study found that working one additional year raises women\u2019s monthly benefits by 8.6% on average\u20147% from an actuarial adjustment and an additional 1.6% from late-career earnings. Men\u2019s benefits increase by less on average\u20147.8%\u2014because they tend to have fewer low-earnings years to replace.Overall, women who delay taking Social Security until 70 increase their monthly payment by 88% over their benefit at age 62, compared with 82% for men. This issue is important because women rely more on Social Security than men, says       Cathy Pareto,        founder of Cathy Pareto & Associates Inc., a wealth-management firm in Coral Gables, Fla.Since women live longer than men, and have earned less on average during their careers, she says, they are at greater risk of running out of retirement funds. Two-thirds of unmarried women, including widows, above age 65 rely on Social Security for more than half their income, Ms. Pareto says.She says women often fail to remember that by stepping out of the workplace for caregiving, they\u2019re sacrificing much more than their salaries. \u201cThis usually translates into a total cessation of retirement plan\u2014such as 401(k)\u2014contributions, and zero credits into the Social Security system for those years, both of which negatively impact their personal wealth and financial security,\u201d Ms. Pareto says. \u201cThe cumulative effect of this can spell hundreds of thousands of dollars.\u201dTo see a record of earnings the Social Security administration is using in its calculation, people can go to https://secure.ssa.gov/ and create an account or log in.

They can either sell the piece on consignment, through an auction or dealer, or they can sell it directly to a gallery.Each has advantages and disadvantages. Selling on consignment in a public auction typically offers the biggest potential financial reward. But auctions have costs and come with great risks as well.So, how to decide? Here is a look at the pros and cons of each approach.Auction houses, which only take items on consignment, hold public sales for certain objects at specific times. For instance, Christie\u2019s and             Sotheby\u2019s                   hold their postwar and contemporary art auctions in New York City in May and November. The art world sits up and takes notice when a painting or sculpture of particular note goes on the block, and record prices in such cases aren\u2019t unusual.However, despite the publicity, prices realized at these auctions often don\u2019t reach great heights. Prospective purchasers know the house will charge a buyer\u2019s premium, as high as 25%, and factor this into their bids. Sellers, meanwhile, are charged a variety of fees (for photography, insurance, storage and marketing), as well as a commission of as much as 20%, depending upon the selling price.Because they occur within a narrow window, auctions also are perilous affairs. A plunge in the stock market, the sudden illness of a likely bidder and other factors can significantly hurt a sale on any given day. Some 20% to 30% of all lots at major auctions don\u2019t sell, and this failure tends to rub off onto the artworks themselves. Indeed, falling short of expectations makes a piece less likely to sell at any time in the near future. Anyone subsequently researching the piece will learn that no one wanted it, which will depress both interest and prices.Transactions with dealers and galleries, by contrast, are private. No one needs to know if the owner of an artwork unsuccessfully offered it to a gallery, whether it is for sale by consignment or a direct sale.Sellers to dealers and galleries, however, must be prepared to accept substantially lower prices than what their piece may bring on the market.Robert Schwarz,        a gallery owner in Philadelphia, says he is often asked two questions by persons looking to sell him a piece: \u201c \u2018What price do you think you can sell it for?\u2019 and \u2018What would you buy it for?\u2019 \u201d Those are two very different prices, says Mr. Schwarz. If he believes he could sell a painting for $100,000, he will offer a price more akin to wholesale\u2014usually between 50% and 75%.Why, then, would anyone consider selling to a gallery or dealer, rather than putting a piece on consignment? Mostly, it is a matter of how long the artwork\u2019s owner can afford to wait before a sale is made.Robert Fishko,        owner of Forum Gallery in New York, says he is often asked by consignors, \u201c \u2018How long will it take to sell?\u2019 I always say, \u2018Five minutes after I show it to the client who wants it.\u2019 \u201dWhen a piece in a gallery on consignment doesn\u2019t sell, the owner has a few options. Consign the piece to another gallery or to an auction house. Hold on to the piece until something changes that improves its prospects. Or consider selling the piece directly\u2014though at a discount\u2014to an interested dealer or gallery. (Dealers and galleries, however, are very selective in what they will purchase.)A few more pointers are in order.Dealers of old masters and 19th century art are more apt to buy works than take them on consignment. Dealers of these pieces don\u2019t mind so much if they take a while to sell. A dealer will often use that time to have canvases cleaned, relined, reframed and researched, in an effort to maximize his or her profit.\u201cWith older art, the prices may fluctuate, but there is no question that people 100 years from now will still be interested in buying works by Corot or Homer or Inness or Whistler,\u201d says       Thomas Colville,        a New York-based private dealer of 19th century American and European art. Mr. Colville says he regularly buys paintings from collectors, paying 60% to 70% of their retail value.Contemporary art dealers, by contrast, tend not to buy works because prices for contemporary artworks can be a roller coaster, and dealers may be nervous about inventory that suddenly goes out of fashion.Janet Borden,        a New York gallery owner specializing in photography, says her gallery buys works by artists it represents only if the edition is sold out. \u201cOtherwise, I am in competition against my own artist,\u201d she says, \u201cand that\u2019s not a good thing.\u201dMr. Grant is a writer in Amherst, Mass.

Are they being realistic?Ms. Bohannan is a lawyer in New Orleans with her own private practice, specializing in divorce, custody and succession planning. She and Mr. Bohannan jointly own a 50% stake in two bars in the French Quarter and a music-publishing company. They also own commercial real estate.Their combined annual income is about $630,000, including net income of $300,000 from the law firm, $166,000 from the rental properties, $148,000 from the bars and $14,000 from music and book royalties. Ms. Bohannan has a published novel.Their retirement plan: Sell the businesses and live off the proceeds and income from their real-estate holdings. \u201cWe watched other people and realized the best way to build wealth was through real estate,\u201d says Mr. Bohannan.Their home is valued at $1.2 million, with a mortgage of $260,000. Their commercial real estate is collectively worth about $3.4 million, but has mortgages totaling about $1 million.The shares of the two bars they own, Turtle Bay and Spirits on Bourbon, are worth about $375,000 and $1 million, respectively. The law practice is worth about $350,000. The music-publishing company is valued at about $250,000. The royalties it pays fluctuate.They currently pay $6,000 monthly for their home mortgage; $50,000 annually for private-school tuition for their two children, in seventh and ninth grade. Their cars are paid off, but insurance is about $2,000 a year. They pay $1,100 per month for health insurance through a plan from one of their bars. Other annual expenditures, including groceries, clothing and entertainment, run about $50,000 a year.The couple want to help their children avoid some of the big risks they have taken. Ms. Bohannan says that on four separate occasions she and her husband spent their last penny to acquire a business or property.They hit a particularly rough financial patch after Hurricane Katrina hit.Still, the Bohannans say they weathered the storm thanks to a very good financial habit: They pay all their bills six months ahead of time.Mr. Bohannan recently sold a third bar. The buyer agreed to pay $400,000 over the next 18 months. The couple are using the proceeds, along with all of the income from their commercial properties, to pay down their commercial mortgages. Their goal is to have their three mortgages paid off before retirement.They have a total of $300,000 in a Simple IRA, a Roth IRA and a 401(k). The couple also has two 529 college-savings accounts, each holding about $45,000. They contribute $3,000 a year to the 529 accounts. They have about $400,000 in savings in addition to their retirement funds.\u201cWe live nicely but try not to spend too much money on stuff,\u201d says Ms. Bohannan.Advice from a pro: Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, says the couple should easily be able to retire on their schedule and cover their living costs for the next four decades.The Bohannans should continue repaying debt and prefunding expenses. If they pay off their mortgages before they retire and the 529 accounts cover what is left of tuition (the couple will likely pay for most of college out of pocket before retiring), they should expect to spend about $100,000 a year. That number is based on their current expenses (adjusted for inflation) and the estimated cost of private health insurance.But the Bohannans should keep a close eye on the cost of health insurance. Right now, plans on Louisiana\u2019s health-care exchange range from $15,000 to $21,000 annually, per couple, and $17,000 to $35,000 if the two children are included, Mr. Clemons says. The price could be substantially more when the couple retires, he adds.Still, the $250,000 of annual income from the commercial real estate alone should easily cover living expenses, assuming the mortgages are paid off, though some maintenance costs should be expected. If the couple sells their businesses for approximately $2 million, they should consider investing a portion in the financial markets, Mr. Clemons says.The couple should start making annual gifts to their children to provide them with a \u201cstartup package,\u201d Mr. Clemons says. Each parent can give $14,000 a year to each child without triggering the gift tax. That money can be used for graduate school, a down payment on a home or to start a business, Mr. Clemons adds.The Bohannans also should consider contributing the maximum amount to their IRA, Roth IRA and 401(k) retirement accounts, which will allow them to defer taxes on their investment returns until they retire. The couple could use some of their savings to fully fund these accounts, Mr. Clemons says.Mr. Clemons suggests they have their real-estate holdings appraised every three to five years, ensuring the income exceeds what they could earn in the market. He says the Bohannans should also revise their financial plan annually, determining whether their key assumptions still hold true, since a retirement of potentially four decades is a very long time.Ms. Ward is a writer in Mendham, N.J.

Mr. Roiland worked as a barista for the first year, received money through a grant the second year and then taught as an adjunct professor for the next five years, earning between $15,000 and $20,000 annually.His income failed to meet his living expenses, so he financed the shortfall through credit cards. He also used credit cards to finance trips to academic conferences where he tried to raise his academic profile by presenting his research and networking.\u201cThe trips absolutely paid off in terms of getting a job, but really sunk me financially,\u201d he says.In 2012, a year after earning his doctorate, Mr. Roiland was hired as a visiting assistant professor at the University of Notre Dame, earning $44,000. In 2014, the University of Maine offered him an assistant professorship in communication and journalism and a $52,000 salary. He took the job, but his income still isn\u2019t enough to meet expenses and service his debts.He currently has $222,692 in student-loan debt, and $46,000 in credit-card debt.\u201cI should have known there would be a day of reckoning,\u201d Mr. Roiland says. \u201cI just figured I would be a professor someday and it would work out.\u201dLast June, the 38-year-old put his student loans in forbearance\u2014that is, his lenders agreed to let him pause his payments. Interest still accrues, though, and has grown by $17,667 since the forbearance began.In September, Mr. Roiland consulted a bankruptcy firm to see whether he could reduce or eliminate his credit-card debt, for which he was paying about $1,110 a month, and possibly the $10,000 he still owes in car payments. He was advised to declare bankruptcy and stop paying his credit cards. Filing for bankruptcy won\u2019t affect his student-loan debt. He submitted the required paperwork to the bankruptcy lawyer in May. Now he needs to wait for his case to appear before bankruptcy court.He is considering getting a part-time job over the summer or supplementing his income as a freelance writer, but he also needs to publish several academic papers to secure tenure.He has about $21,615 in a 403b retirement account offered by the university, to which he contributes $176 a month, or about 4% of his base salary. The university contributes 10% of his annual base salary to the 403b, he says. Health insurance, totaling about $170 a month, is also deducted from each paycheck.His take-home pay is about $3,000 a month. His recurring expenses include $800 a month for rent; a $288 car payment; $80 for car insurance, $100 for gas; $175 for phone and internet; $500 for food and entertainment and $100 on utilities. He expects to pay $378 a month for his student loans once they come out of forbearance in October.Advice from a Pro:        Kelly Barrow,        a certified financial planner and a wealth-management adviser at TIAA, supports Mr. Roiland\u2019s idea of supplementing his income over the summer.She says he should review his expenses for the past six months, sorting them into categories to see where the money goes. Then he should build an emergency fund\u2014enough to cover three months of expenses\u2014which will let him pay for the unexpected, like car repairs, without taking on more debt. Mr. Roiland and his bankruptcy lawyer should discuss how building up his savings might affect the bankruptcy proceedings, she says.Regarding his student loans, the adviser suggests that someone in the university\u2019s financial-aid office should be able to help him choose the best repayment plan and identify all requirements and qualifications, so there are no surprises going forward, she says.Mr. Roiland should also discuss with his bankruptcy lawyer whether it makes sense to take his student loans out of forbearance before October to avoid accumulating more interest on the debt, she says.Once the bankruptcy settlement is completed, he should make sure he repays creditors and his student loans on time. That will help rebuild his credit, Ms. Barrow says. He then may want to consider using a secured credit card, for which he would deposit money up front, and which he should pay off each month. If he succeeds, it should further rebuild his credit, she says.As his earnings increase, Mr. Roiland should boost his contribution to his 403b plan as much as he can, Ms. Barrow says. He will need to step up his savings significantly to be on track to retire by the time he is 67 or 70.Ms. Ward is a writer in Mendham, N.J.

The center-right Les R\u00e9publicains and its allies came in second with 21.6% of the vote.The first-round vote puts Mr. Macron\u2019s party and MoDem on track to win a majority of 415 to 455 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly in the second-round vote a week from now, polling firm Ipsos Sopra-Steria said.The top two vote-getters in each district\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0advance to the second-round runoff, as well as candidates who garner support from more than 12.5% of registered voters, though reaching that threshold may be difficult given low turnout on Sunday. The Interior Ministry said 51.3% of registered voters didn\u2019t vote, which Ipsos Sopra-Steria said is the highest percentage of abstentions on record for a legislative election in France.More voters are expected to switch in the second round to candidates from La R\u00e9publique en Marche, as a centrist party, than to candidates from parties on the right or the left, polling firms said.Such a landslide would deliver a coup de grace to France\u2019s political establishment, giving Mr. Macron a strong mandate to implement policies he says are needed to stir the sluggish national economy and overhaul the European Union.\u201cIt\u2019s the end of a system that French people don\u2019t want to see any longer,\u201d said Mounir Mahjoubi, the 33-year-old digital economy minister who is running for Mr. Macron\u2019s party in a Paris district.In little more than a year, the 39-year-old Mr. Macron has founded his own political party; populated it mostly with political neophytes; and persuaded voters to hand him what is shaping up to be one of the largest Assembly majorities in French history.If the party and its ally win 415 to 455 seats, it would be the largest majority since the center-right won a 472-seat majority in 1993.A commanding legislative victory would also cement Mr. Macron\u2019s stature among European leaders. Mr. Macron and his party ran on a pro-Europe message rather than catering to nationalist constituencies.The French election has been closely watched in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking reelection in September. British Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       decision to call an early election in a bid to expand her parliamentary ranks and strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations badly backfired\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0when voters deprived her of a majority.The National Front of far-right leader Marine Le Pen could increase its number of seats in the Assembly from one to up to 5, according to projections by Ipsos Sopra-Steria. That is a far cry from the numbers her party was seeking to mount a robust opposition to Mr. Macron.The National Front needs a minimum of 15 seats to secure posts on parliamentary commissions and earn extra speaking slots at the Assembly. In past elections, voters have coalesced behind mainstream candidates opposing the National Front in the second round.\u201cPatriotic voters in districts where our candidates qualified for the second round must head to the polls in massive numbers next Sunday,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said.Ms. Le Pen said she had qualified for the runoff in a district in northern France.The Socialist Party, the outgoing majority at the Assembly, won only 7.4% of the vote, putting it and allies on track to win between 20 and 30 seats, according to the projections. Les R\u00e9publicains, which formed the largest opposition, was set to win between 70 and 110 seats with its allies, according to the projections.Fran\u00e7ois Baroin, leader of the campaign for Les R\u00e9publicains, said his party suffered from the low turnout and called on voters to \u201cwake up\u201d for the second round to elect a large opposition to Mr. Macron.\u201cOur country wants balanced powers that are not concentrated in one single party,\u201d Mr. Baroin said.Mr. Macron\u2019s first order of business is loosening France\u2019s rigid labor code. In July, his government will seek the backing of parliament to give companies more power to negotiate working conditions with employees and reduce uncertainty for employers making layoffs.The French president is betting that such overhauls will strengthen his hand to push Germany and other wealthy Northern European nations to share the burdens of weaker eurozone members.That kind of deal, Mr. Macron says, is key to \u201crefounding Europe\u201d as a bloc of countries that protects citizens rather than leaving them vulnerable to the competition of global markets.\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten used to managing Europe. If we continue just managing it, it will fall apart,\u201d Mr. Macron said in May on his first trip to Brussels as president.Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, has long been leery of French calls for more sharing of resources in the eurozone, seeing that as a veiled demand for German money. But Ms. Merkel has signaled she wants to work closely with Mr. Macron on deeper European integration, even though proposals that smack too clearly of fiscal transfers are likely to be off limits.Write to William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Macron\u2019s Party on Track for Big Majority.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 21:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/macrons-party-on-track-for-majority-in-french-vote-1497204520", "news_title": "Macron\u2019s Party on Track for Large Majority in French Vote ", "keywords": " eu, european union, france,french election, macron,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "U.S. sales of blockbuster prostate-cancer drugs have dropped sharply since the start of a federal investigation into charities that help patients pay for these drugs, as the manufacturers have reduced donations to the charities and instead given away the medicines for free.Drugmakers donate hundreds of millions of dollars a year to charities that help U.S. patients cover out-of-pocket costs for drugs. In turn, the drugmakers rely on the charities to effectively boost the sales of those drugs. The assistance ensures patients fill their prescriptions, and insurance pays the rest of the tab.Every $1 million donated to charities can lead to up to $21 million in sales for drug companies, according to Citi Research. Because very few companies make prostate-cancer drugs, they tend to donate proportionally more to these charities than manufacturers of other treatments do.Federal prosecutors in late 2015 started to investigate charities that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients, and at least six companies\u2014including the top two prostate-cancer drugmakers,             Johnson & Johnson        JNJ 0.56%       and             Pfizer Inc.        PFE 0.78%      \u2014have received federal subpoenas seeking information about their dealings with the charities, according to securities filings.It is unclear what the prosecutors are looking into, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Boston, which securities filings said sent the subpoenas, declined to comment.\u2018[Drugmakers] got scared and stopped funding the cancer-assistance programs.\u2019Donations to funds providing prostate-cancer drug assistance have fallen off since the investigation began, according to industry officials, analysts and charities.With the foundations less able to help patients, the drug companies decided to give away more of the drugs for free. Sales of the two top-selling prostate-cancer drugs, J&J\u2019s Zytiga and Pfizer\u2019s Xtandi dropped 14% and 11% respectively in the first quarter from a year earlier.The companies \u201cgot scared and stopped funding the cancer-assistance programs,\u201d said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Ronny Gal. \u201cSo instead, they gave the drug for free. When you give patients [a drug] for free, it comes off your sales number.\u201dThe sales drop offers a window into a Byzantine arrangement that has drawn criticism for increasing health-care costs by keeping patients on ever-costlier medicines.Patient-assistance charities help patients skirt some of the hurdles that insurers use to control spending: copays, coinsurance and high deductibles. Faced with the hurdles, patients who can\u2019t afford their share may seek a cheaper alternative, or not get their prescription filled at all. But once a foundation covers the patient\u2019s share, the prescription gets filled and the drug\u2019s manufacturer gets paid for the much larger balance of the cost by the patient\u2019s health plan.Zytiga lists for $9,400 a month and Xtandi for $9,900, according to wholesale-acquisition-cost data from Truven Health Analytics. Medicare drug plans vary widely, but out-of-pocket costs for cancer drugs like Zytiga can surpass $7,000 a year, according to a 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.For commercially insured patients, drug companies run their own foundations that assist low-income patients. But for Medicare patients, certain kinds of assistance from company-controlled foundations could run afoul of anti-kickback law that bars financial inducements in government-run programs.Around the time that Medicare\u2019s drug benefit, known as Part D, went into effect in 2006, many independent charities began to spring up. They include the Patient Access Network Foundation, which is among the leading providers of charitable financial assistance to prostate-cancer patients.To avoid crossing anti-kickback rules, the charities aren\u2019t supposed to use their aid to steer patients to any particular company\u2019s drug.The eight biggest charities got more than $1.1 billion in donations mostly from drug companies in 2014\u2014the latest available data\u2014to provide financial assistance to Medicare patients, according to Bernstein Research.Starting in late 2015, companies including J&J, Pfizer,             Biogen Inc.,Celgene Corp.      ,             Gilead Sciences                   and             Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.       received subpoenas or other requests for information about their relationships with these foundations, according to securities filings. Biogen, Celgene and Gilead declined to comment. Valeant said it is cooperating.A J&J spokesman said the company donated more than $47 million to various independent charities last year to help patients get treatment \u201cregardless of the medicine prescribed by the physician\u201d and J&J checks to make sure the foundations comply with all laws and regulations. J&J has said federal prosecutors from Massachusetts asked for records \u201cpertaining to payments to any\u201d charities that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients.Pfizer has said prosecutors asked for materials regarding the Patient Access Network Foundation and other charities.The PAN Foundation wouldn\u2019t say whether it has also received subpoenas.\u201cPAN has really always prided itself as being a trustworthy and compliant organization. We put a premium on operating within guidelines,\u201d PAN Foundation CEO       Daniel Klein       said.Pfizer CEO       Ian Read       said during a recent earnings conference call that government scrutiny of the charities has had a temporary \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the availability of the assistance. He said he expects the matter to be resolved this year, and Pfizer will keep making donations to the foundations to \u201chelp ensure that patients can afford medically necessary drugs.\u201dAmong the patients who wound up getting free drugs from a manufacturer because a charity wasn\u2019t accepting applications was       John Kleck.Mr. Kleck, 75 years old, a retired elementary-school teacher living in Pittsburgh, was prescribed Zytiga in late March. He couldn\u2019t afford the $2,900 he owed out of pocket for the first month of the prescription, said       Bethany Lyon,        the social worker at the UPMC CancerCenter who helped him secure assistance. Ms. Lyon said she checked with the PAN Foundation and other charities and couldn\u2019t find one making grants, so she sought J&J\u2019s help.Mr. Kleck met J&J\u2019s eligibility requirements, and the company is providing the drug free for the rest of the year.Mr. Klein, the CEO of PAN, said the charity received $582 million in drug-company donations last year. Health-department rules bar the charity from saying which companies made the donations, he said.Last year, the PAN Foundation gave out nearly 10,000 grants to prostate-cancer patients with incomes less than five times the federal poverty level, most of them insured by Medicare, according to Mr. Klein.But Mr. Klein said the foundation didn\u2019t get enough donations to its prostate-cancer fund to meet demand and therefore didn\u2019t take applications during the second half of last year. After a donation early this year, the fund reopened in March until running out of money a week later, after helping 1,500 patients.The Patient Advocate Foundation, another leading prostate-cancer charity, said it also was closed earlier this year but reopened in recent weeks. A third charity, Good Days, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Write to Jonathan D.

WMT -0.43%       and             Kroger Co.      , and a growing threat to traditional food retailers.Aldi said it is expected to have a total of 2,500 locations across the U.S. by 2022. Its plan comes as another German discounter, Lidl, is set to open its first 10 stores in the U.S. on Thursday as part of a multiyear expansion.Executives at Wal-Mart and Kroger have been preparing for the growth of the discounters for years. Wal-Mart has been sprucing up its stores and slashing prices on some products in select markets, while Kroger continues to drive down costs to compete.But the discounters could have a big impact on the U.S. grocery market as they did in Europe. Their market share there has steadily grown while traditional supermarkets have seen theirs fall.Deep discount chains in the U.S. are expected to grow by up to 10% a year through 2020, five times the rate of traditional grocers, according to a recent report by consulting firm Bain & Co.\u201cIt should absolutely be more than scary to traditional grocers and retailers,\u201d said Mikey Vu, a partner in Bain\u2019s retail practice.Many shoppers in the U.S. are unfamiliar with Aldi. The chain has been in the U.S. since 1976, but long has focused on lower-income shoppers by offering budget items. Aldi doesn\u2019t invest in big marketing campaigns as part of its strategy to keep prices low, grocery executives said.Aldi has improved its stores and products in recent years and is now having more success in attracting a larger mix of shoppers, Mr. Vu said.Officials at Aldi and Lidl, which is new in the U.S., said they are a step ahead of their competitors given their longstanding use of store brands to drive down price. About 90% of the goods carried at Aldi stores and the coming Lidl ones will be private label, they said.Traditional grocers say that direct comparisons with the discounters on price aren\u2019t possible given that they carry name-brand goods that Aldi and Lidl don\u2019t stock.A Wal-Mart spokeswoman said that the retailer remains committed to offering low-prices, but they are also focused on \u201cquality, freshness, assortment, experience and convenience.\u201dKroger declined to comment.European shoppers are much more accustomed to buying private-label products than Americans. But loyalty to brands in the U.S. is slowly eroding and could lead more shoppers to try Aldi or Lidl, especially millennials, said Mike Paglia, director at research firm Kantar Retail.\u201c[Millennials] are value oriented and don\u2019t hold the same stigmas about private-label items that older generations do,\u201d said Mr. Paglia, who has consulted with suppliers to Wal-Mart and other major retailers to help them prepare for the expansion of deep discounters.A recent Kantar Retail shopper survey found that 64% of respondents said they trusted store brands from big retailers, and 42% said that buying them made them feel like smart consumers. Scott Patton, an Aldi divisional vice president, said its private-label offerings makes the grocer stand out from competitors.\u201cMany of our competitors are trying to copy our blueprint,\u201d said Mr. Patton. \u201cWe have a tremendous head start on them.\u201dAldi said the new openings are also expected to create 25,000 jobs over the next five years.Lidl spokesman William Harwood\u2019s said: \u201cWe\u2019re building on the success we\u2019ve had all across Europe.\u201dWrite to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Pressure on U.S. Grocers Rises.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 21:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-discount-grocer-aldi-sets-u-s-expansion-plan-1497229200", "news_title": "German Discount Grocer Aldi Sets U.S. Expansion Plan ", "keywords": "aldi,expansion,grocery,wal-mart,Aldi,Lidl,Wal-Mart Stores,WMT,Kroger,KR,Mike Paglia,Mikey Vu,William Harwood,plans,strategy,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility openings,retail,wholesale,food retailing,supermarkets,grocery stores,specialty stores,mixed retailing,shopping malls,superstores"}, {"content": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate increases aren\u2019t having the desired effect of cooling off Wall Street\u2019s hot streak.While Fed officials meeting this week will likely decide to raise short-term interest rates for a fourth time since December 2015, much of that tightening effort has yet to be felt in financial markets, where stocks have rallied to records this year and bond yields have fallen, developments that tend to prompt more borrowing, faster economic growth and more market speculation.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite stock index, despite a drop Friday afternoon, is still up 15% as it nears the midyear mark and the S&P 500 index a robust 9% so far in 2017. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes have dropped to their lowest levels since November, meaning borrowing costs are falling for many households and businesses even as the Fed tries to raise them.Broad financial conditions are as accommodative now as they were in early 2015, the point of maximum Fed stimulus, according to a closely watched Goldman Sachs index, which measures the combined impact of movements in interest rates, stock prices and the value of the dollar.Easy financial conditions create a risk the market could overheat and then snap back, sending yields soaring and choking off lending, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. \u201cThe rubber band is stretching out here.\u201dIn theory, financial conditions should serve as the conduit between the Fed\u2019s monetary policy and the real economy. When the Fed lifts short-term rates, long-term rates should rise also and financial conditions should tighten.The fact that the central bank and Wall Street are moving in opposite directions suggests limits to the Fed\u2019s influence over the economy. If it persists, it could also prompt the Fed to shift its strategy. If your dance partner doesn\u2019t follow, you might hold that person tighter.\u201cIf we decide that we need to tighten financial conditions and we raise short-term interest rates and that doesn\u2019t accomplish our objective, then we\u2019re going to have to tighten short-term interest rates by more,\u201d New York Fed President       William Dudley       told The Wall Street Journal last year.It is still too early to say whether officials will raise rates more aggressively than planned. Still, Harvard University economist       Jeremy Stein,        a former Fed governor, said because financial conditions are so loose after three rate increases, the Fed is less likely to back away from its plan to keep raising rates, even in the face of low inflation.Markets could be underestimating the Fed\u2019s willingness to pursue its stated path of raising rates twice more this year. Officials are also working on a mechanism to unload some of the Treasury and mortgage securities they bought in the aftermath of the financial crisis and recession.Investors are broadly split over whether the Fed will manage more than one additional move in 2017, according to CME Group data.Fed officials note it takes time for their policy moves to translate through to markets and the broader economy. That lag makes it difficult for them to perfectly engineer financial conditions and raises the risk the Fed could overreact and significantly reduce credit.Today\u2019s disconnect is reminiscent of the 2004-2006 period, when financial conditions stayed loose even as the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by 4.25 percentage points. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan called it a \u201cconundrum.\u201dHis successor, Ben Bernanke, suggested long-term borrowing costs were kept down by rapidly developing countries in Asia pouring U.S. dollar holdings\u2014accumulated through large trade surpluses\u2014into Treasury securities, a phenomenon he called the \u201cglobal savings glut.\u201dThose loose financial conditions helped inflate the housing bubble that led to the financial crisis in 2007.Today, many economists and central bankers once again say the split between Fed policy and market conditions is due to developments over which the Fed has little control. Aggressive central bank stimulus in the eurozone and Japan has pushed down borrowing costs in those countries. That\u2019s prompted investors there to look to U.S. government debt for better returns, pushing up the price of long-term Treasury securities and driving down yields, said Mr. Stein.Meanwhile, expectations that the Trump administration would usher in a growth-boosting tax overhaul are waning, pushing Treasury yields down. The long-lagged effects of super easy monetary policy may also be accumulating in stock values.Moreover, the global economy has picked up this year, which boosts equity prices while weakening the dollar. China\u2019s efforts to stabilize its currency by selling U.S. assets have put added downward pressure on the dollar.Fed governor       Jerome Powell       told an audience this month he wasn\u2019t yet concerned about the similarities to the precrisis era.At least for now.\u201cIf something like that\u00a0does persist, then I think it\u2019s something you need to take into account in setting monetary policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s premature to be doing that today.\u201dWrite to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Fed Finds Foe in Financial Markets.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 20:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-effort-to-guide-markets-falls-short-1497182401", "news_title": "Fed\u2019s Effort to Guide Markets Falls Short", "keywords": " fed, federal reserve, interest rates, stock market,the outlook,Federal Reserve,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Puerto Rican voters endorsed a nonbinding referendum for statehood Sunday, but low turnout suggested that the island\u2019s more than three million inhabitants are split on the best path out of the territory\u2019s economic crisis.According to early results on a government website, statehood drew 97% of support with more than 90% of votes counted Sunday afternoon, but less than one in four voters participated in the plebiscite as opponents called for a boycott. Polls closed at 3 p.m. Sunday.The vote was spearheaded by the territory\u2019s governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, who has pushed for statehood as a way to help improve the island\u2019s economy, which is weighed down by debts of more than $73 billion. In May, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 declared what amounts to the largest-ever municipal bankruptcy in the U.S. that placed Puerto Rico under court protection.Congress would need to authorize a new state. Mr. Rossell\u00f3 recently signed into law a measure creating a commission to press U.S. lawmakers for admission. On Sunday evening, he said he would visit Washington, D.C. to formally notify Congress and the White House of the results.\u201cFrom today going forward, the federal government will no longer be able to ignore the voice of the majority of the American citizens in Puerto Rico,\u201d Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said.A hashtag supporting the boycott was active on Twitter on Sunday, with some island residents tweeting that the vote was pointless, given their view that the U.S. government wouldn\u2019t support statehood.\u201cI think that everyone knows that this is a waste of money and that it\u2019s just an ideological statement,\u201d said Charles Venator-Santiago, an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut who has been critical of the statehood movement and who had just returned from Puerto Rico.Voters on Sunday had three options: statehood, independence or a continuation of its current status as a territory.With a low turnout, political foes to statehood likely will say the vote isn\u2019t credible, which could further hurt Puerto Rico\u2019s already daunting chances of getting Congress to grant the island full admission to the U.S., said Christina Duffy Ponsa, an expert on constitutional law and Puerto Rican statehood at Columbia Law School. \u201cI think politically speaking, their argument could have traction,\u201d she said.Luis S\u00e1nchez, who works for a family food-distribution company with locations in Puerto Rico and Orlando, Fla., cast a ballot for statehood.Mr. S\u00e1nchez said a permanent union with the U.S. would separate Puerto Rico from other Latin American countries, like Cuba and Venezuela, in terms of quality of life and civil rights. He said the inability of the island\u2019s residents to elect voting members of Congress puts them at a disadvantage.\u201cThere are a lot of decisions being made in the high spheres of the U.S. government that pertain to Puerto Rico or have to do with the island and we don\u2019t have a say,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is kind of unfair because whatever happens in the U.S. directly affects us.\u201dSupporters of statehood say gaining full entry to the U.S. could help the island recover from a decadelong recession and shrink its debtload. Statehood would allow Puerto Rico to draw more investment and tap a larger share of federal funding, supporters say.The Popular Democratic Party\u2014which prefers to keep the island\u2019s current status, though with more autonomy\u2014urged voters to boycott the vote. The party said the referendum is rigged in support of statehood, in part because the governing party had initially sought to exclude the territorial option from the ballot.President       Donald Trump       and both U.S. national parties have said they support allowing Puerto Ricans to choose their status. But many analysts say a statehood bid could face strong opposition from a Republican-led Congress because Puerto Ricans in the U.S. vote heavily Democratic.U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D., Fla.) emphasized her support for statehood Sunday evening. \u201cGiven their contributions to our nation in times of war and peace for well over a century, they deserve to have the same rights and responsibilities as their fellow citizens living in Florida and every other state,\u201d Ms. Murphy said.Under the current status, Puerto Ricans are born U.S. citizens, but those living on the island can\u2019t vote for president and have only one representative in Congress, a resident commissioner who can\u2019t vote.Puerto Ricans don\u2019t pay federal income tax on income earned on the island, but income earned elsewhere is taxable. They also pay federal levies like the payroll tax. Federal employees such as judges do pay taxes on income earned in Puerto Rico.Sunday\u2019s vote is the fifth time since 1967 that the island\u2019s residents have gone to the polls to vote on the issue. In the 1967, 1993 and 1998 votes, statehood never won an outright majority.In the most recent plebiscite\u2014a two-part referendum in 2012\u2014voters rejected continuing the status quo in the first question, and then a majority opted for statehood over independence in the second question. But about 500,000 voters left the second question blank as a form of protest, which undermined the credibility of the endorsement for statehood.Hawaii was the last territory added, becoming the 50th state in 1959.Write to Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.com and Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Puerto Ricans Vote for Statehood.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 19:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-rican-voters-head-to-polls-in-statehood-vote-1497182403", "news_title": "Puerto Ricans Vote for Statehood ", "keywords": " 51st state, plebiscite, pr vote,puerto rico statehood,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify\u00a0Tuesday before the same Senate committee that heard from former FBI Director       James Comey       last week, keeping national attention on a Russia investigation that White House officials have been trying to push to the background.Mr. Sessions earlier this year was forced to recuse himself from the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 election after he belatedly disclosed two meetings with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Mr. Comey, during his testimony last week, raised the possibility of other concerns about Mr. Sessions\u2019s dealings with Russia during the campaign, saying Federal Bureau of Investigation leadership before the recusal was \u201caware of facts that I can\u2019t discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic.\u201dIn a weekend letter, Mr. Sessions canceled previously planned public testimony before House and Senate appropriations panels. He said that the testimony by Mr. Comey, whom       Mr. Trump       fired in early May, made it \u201cimportant that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum,\u201d which he said was the Senate Intelligence Committee.It is unclear whether the intelligence committee hearing will be held in public.The Comey appearance dominated a week in which the administration said it had hoped to highlight its stated goal to improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure. This week,\u00a0President Donald Trump will make expansion of apprenticeship programs the center of his labor policy, aimed at filling a\u00a0record level of open jobs\u00a0and drawing back Americans who have left the workforce.The president\u2019s schedule includes a visit to Wisconsin\u00a0on Tuesday, where he will stop by\u00a0a technical college\u2014the same day Mr. Sessions is on Capitol Hill.But Mr. Trump is helping to keep the Russia probe front and center. Last Friday, he blasted Mr. Comey in a joint news conference with the Romanian president.In a tweet Sunday\u00a0morning, Mr. Trump called Mr. Comey \u201ccowardly\u201d for asking a friend to tell reporters about conversations he had with the president. During those conversations, Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump had talked about the investigation of former national security adviser       Mike Flynn\u2019s       ties to Russia and had said, \u201cI hope you can let this go.\u201d The president denies having done that.\u201cI believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible,\u201d Mr. Trump said Sunday\u00a0morning. \u201cTotally illegal? Very \u2018cowardly!\u2019 \u201dMany legal experts say there was nothing illegal about Mr. Comey\u2019s actions, given that the material wasn\u2019t classified and that he was no longer a government employee. Mr. Comey testified last week that he asked his friend to share the content of the conversations so it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel, which it did, when former FBI Director Robert Mueller was named to the post.Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets are drawing rebukes even from people in his own party.\u201cI think the worst problem this president has in this instance is the president himself,\u201d former Rep. Mike Rogers (R., Mich.) said\u00a0Sunday\u00a0on CNN. \u201cIf he would stop talking about the small-ball individual tweets, attacking Director Comey personally, I think we could get beyond this.\u201dSen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.), speaking on             CBS,       said Mr. Trump was obstructing his own agenda.\u00a0Addressing Mr. Trump directly, Mr. Graham said: \u201cYou may be the first president in history to go down because you can\u2019t stop inappropriately talking about an investigation that if you just were quiet, would clear you.\u201dBut part of the Trump legal strategy is to call into question Mr. Comey\u2019s credibility. Jay Sekulow, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, pointed to statements regarding the FBI investigation of       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       use of a private email server while secretary of state.\u201cJames Comey\u2019s credibility has been brought into question on multiple occasions during the Clinton investigation, and here ultimately the special counsel has to weigh that as he does his investigation,\u201d Mr. Sekulow said\u00a0Sunday\u00a0on ABC. Mr. Comey has defended his handling of the Clinton email probe.Beyond his contacts with Russian officials, Mr. Sessions also may face questions about why he didn\u2019t do more to shield Mr. Comey, who worked for him, from Mr. Trump\u2019s private outreach.Mr. Comey told the Senate panel that the president had Mr. Sessions and others leave the room so he could talk to Mr. Comey alone, and that is when Mr. Trump allegedly pressured him on the Flynn investigation.Mr. Comey also said he later appealed to Mr. Sessions to ensure that he would not again be left alone with Mr. Trump, but that Mr. Sessions didn\u2019t respond.\u00a0A Justice Department spokesman rejected that characterization and said Mr. Sessions told Mr. Comey the agency needed to be careful about \u201cfollowing appropriate policies\u201d regarding such contacts.Mr. Sessions was a vocal advocate for Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, and his staffers and former aides have taken jobs in the White House and across the administration. Still, Mr. Trump was upset after Mr. Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe, one White House official said. The president, who has denied any involvement with Russia election hacking, viewed Mr. Sessions\u2019s decision as a sign of weakness, the official said.Mr. Sessions is also expected to face Senate questioning about why he was involved in firing Mr. Comey given that he had recused himself from questions related to Russia. As FBI director, Mr. Comey was overseeing that investigation.In an interview with NBC News last month, Mr. Trump said he was thinking about \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d when he decided to fire Mr. Comey, but the White House initially cited a recommendation for termination by Mr. Sessions and a deputy attorney general based on Mr. Comey\u2019s broader job performance.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said\u00a0Sunday\u00a0that this is one of several questions Mr. Sessions should be asked to answer and said it should be done in a public session.\u201cThe president said Comey was fired because of Russia.\u00a0How does that fit in with his recusal? It doesn\u2019t seem to stand up well to me,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on CBS.The attorney general also drew some criticism from Democrats for the en masse firings of U.S. attorneys, including Preet Bharara in Manhattan, earlier this year. Mr. Bharara said\u00a0Sunday\u00a0on ABC that Mr. Trump called him three times following his election and fired him less than a day after he refused to return the third call from the newly elected president.\u201cIt appeared to be that he was trying to cultivate some kind of relationship,\u201d Mr. Bharara said in the TV interview.The White House didn\u2019t comment on Mr. Bharara\u2019s account.\u2014Michael C.

The Domestic Emoluments Clause says the president may receive only a salary set by Congress and no other emolument from the states. An emolument is typically defined as a fee or salary.\u201cNeither the text nor the history of the Clauses shows that they were intended to reach benefits arising from a President\u2019s private business pursuits having nothing to do with his office or personal service to a foreign power,\u201d Justice Department lawyers wrote in a Friday filing asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit.The clauses apply \u201conly to the receipt of compensation for personal services and to the receipt of honors and gifts based on official position,\u201d the brief said.Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses places him in the company of past high-ranking U.S. officials who profited while in office, the lawyers said. Vice President       Nelson Rockefeller       had stockholdings in major oil companies and other corporations that conducted business globally, the brief said.Few courts have pondered the Foreign Emoluments Clause. Some legal experts say the clause was intended to prevent U.S. officials from entering the employ of foreign governments, making it inapplicable to Mr. Trump\u2019s situation. Foreign governments aren\u2019t hiring Mr. Trump by paying for their officials to stay in his hotels.The CREW complaint asks a federal judge to halt the alleged constitutional violations, including payments from foreign-government officials who patronize Mr. Trump\u2019s hotels and foreign-government-owned enterprises that lease space in Trump Tower or otherwise do business with the Trump Organization. The lawsuit also seeks to require Mr. Trump to release financial records to confirm that his businesses are steering clear of constitutional trouble.Mr. Trump has committed to donating to the U.S. Treasury all profits from foreign-government payments made to his hotels.Even if the lawsuit ultimately fails, it could force Mr. Trump to turn over more information about his businesses and finances, under rules that dictate the exchange of evidence in legal cases. Mr. Trump was the first president in 40 years to decline to release his federal tax returns.But the lawsuit would have to survive the motion filed Friday before Mr. Trump would be required to release the information. The immediate hurdle for CREW is showing Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to divest has injured the group, giving it standing to sue. CREW said in the lawsuit that Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct has forced it to \u201cdivert essential and limited resources\u201d away from its other matters.The group refiled the complaint in April and May with new plaintiffs, including the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United Inc., whose members include restaurants that compete with Mr. Trump\u2019s hotels. The lawsuit says his businesses have an unfair advantage over theirs now that he is president.Two other plaintiffs\u2014      Eric Goode       and       Jill Phaneuf      \u2014own or work with hotels that compete directly with Mr. Trump\u2019s and would lose income if foreign governments choose the president\u2019s businesses over theirs, the lawsuit says.Justice Department lawyers used the bulk of their 51-page brief to argue that plaintiffs have offered the court only a \u201cspeculative chain of possibilities\u201d rather than concrete injuries caused by the alleged violations.\u201cNo law of economics suggests that, in markets this diffuse and competitive, the restaurants and hotels affiliated with Plaintiffs will imminently lose business to the five restaurants and three hotels affiliated with the President,\u201d the brief says.Deepak Gupta,        a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said his clients have \u201ca very strong basis for standing to challenge the president\u2019s constitutional violations.\u201dMr. Trump faces other lawsuits that target his businesses or him personally.The owner of a Washington, D.C., wine bar sued Mr. Trump in March for unfair competition under local law, alleging that the Trump International Hotel has siphoned customers who \u201cbelieve it would be to their advantage in their dealings with President Donald J. Trump and others agencies of the United States Government if they patronized the hotel.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, calling the lawsuit meritless, have asked a federal court in Washington to dismiss the claims.\u201cA business\u2019s use of an individual\u2019s status in society, fame or even ability to \u2018open doors\u2019 simply does not constitute unfair competition,\u201d wrote       Rebecca Woods       of Seyfarth Shaw LLP, a lawyer for the hotel.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said he is immune from being sued in state court, after a defamation lawsuit in New York was filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Mr. Trump\u2019s reality show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d who alleges Mr. Trump groped her in a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007. Mr. Trump has called Ms. Zervos\u2019s account \u201ctotally false\u201d and accused her and other woman who came forward alleging sexual misconduct of seeking attention.The lawsuit says Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cfalse, disparaging statements\u201d subjected Ms. Zervos to threats of violence, reputational damage and economic harm. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have until July 7 to respond to the complaint, which asks for unspecified damages.Bill Clinton       unsuccessfully argued he was immune, as a sitting president, from a lawsuit\u200bfiled in federal court by a former Arkansas state employee who said she faced retaliation after rebuffing Mr. Clinton\u2019s sexual advances when he was governor.Mr. Trump also is facing a lawsuit in Kentucky from a group of protesters who allege they were attacked at a Trump campaign rally in Louisville and say the president is liable for it. A judge in March allowed much of the lawsuit to go forward, rejecting a request by Mr. Trump to dismiss it.While new cases are cropping up, some are fading away.That is true of two cases in Washington involving Mr. Trump\u2019s battles with celebrity chefs Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and Geoffrey Zakarian, who dropped plans to operate restaurants in the president\u2019s new downtown hotel, citing his campaign comments about Mexican immigrants. The parties announced settlements of the cases in April. The terms weren\u2019t disclosed.Write to Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.com and Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Administration Rebuts Claims on Foreign Payments.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 19:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-argues-trumps-businesses-can-accept-foreign-payments-1497053650", "news_title": "Justice Department Argues Trump\u2019s Businesses Can Accept Foreign Payments", "keywords": "donald trump, emoluments clause, trump lawsuits, trump organization,Trump Organization,Restaurant Opportunities Centers United,Trump International Hotel,Donald Trump,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "Microsoft Corp.        MSFT 0.76%       on Sunday said its next videogame console will go on sale Nov. 7 for $499, about $100 more than             Sony Corp.\u2019s       high-end PlayStation 4 Pro.The Xbox One X will be Microsoft\u2019s smallest gaming machine yet in size, though it packs in more power, speed and graphical fidelity than its predecessors, Xbox chief       Phil Spencer       said at a company event ahead of the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo, better known as E3.Microsoft highlighted several new games coming exclusively to the Xbox One platform, which includes the new Xbox One X as well as Windows 10 and the original Xbox One. But there won\u2019t be any games made solely for the Xbox One X.The Xbox One X also will be compatible with games developed for the original Xbox One and Xbox 360, many of which will play faster and look better, the company said.Microsoft first revealed that the Xbox One X was under development a year ago, giving it the code name Project Scorpio. Meanwhile, rival Sony released a beefier PlayStation 4 in November for $399. Sony has said all models of the PlayStation 4 combined have sold more than 60 million units world-wide to date. Microsoft stopped reporting Xbox unit sales in late 2014, though analysts estimate about 30 million have been sold to date.The timing of the new machines represents a departure from tradition, as companies traditionally had waited six to seven years in between introducing significant upgrades.Microsoft and Sony both introduced their previous generation consoles in late 2013.             Nintendo                   in March released the Switch for $299, in what so far has been a successful launch following poor sales of its predecessor, the Wii U, which first went on sale in 2012.Write to Sarah E.

SO 0.23%       and             Toshiba Corp.        TOSYY -2.51%       have reached a deal aimed at allowing the U.S. utility to finish a half-constructed nuclear plant in Georgia that was being built by the Japanese conglomerate\u2019s bankrupt Westinghouse Electric Co. unit.Under the agreement, Toshiba agreed to pay Southern $3.68 billion to help cover the costs of completing two reactors at the long-delayed nuclear plant, while Southern agreed not to ask for more, even if the project continues to run over budget.\u201cWe are happy to have Toshiba\u2019s cooperation in connection with this agreement which provides a strong foundation for the future of these nuclear power plants,\u201d       Thomas A. Fanning,        Southern\u2019s chairman and CEO, said in a statement late Friday. Mr. Fanning had previously said that without the payment, the nuclear plants\u00a0wouldn\u2019t be\u00a0finished.Started in 2008, the\u00a0project, known as the\u00a0Vogtle Electric Generating Plant,\u00a0is only 42% built, according to\u00a0a regulatory filing. It is several years behind schedule and billions of dollars\u00a0over\u00a0budget.Toshiba and Southern have been negotiating\u00a0the continuing costs and responsibilities since late March, when Westinghouse Electric filed for bankruptcy protection.\u00a0The U.S. unit was struggling financially due to billions of dollars in losses from the Vogtle facility in Georgia and another half-finished project, the V.C. Summer nuclear power plant in South Carolina.Toshiba said in a statement that it was working on a similar agreement to cap its liabilities with             Scana Corp.      , the owner of the unfinished South Carolina plant.The mounting losses from the U.S. nuclear projects have forced Toshiba\u00a0to take large write-downs and sell off divisions. In April, Toshiba\u00a0expressed doubt for the first time that it could survive in light of\u00a0the huge losses at its U.S. nuclear subsidiary\u00a0and said it would look to sell\u00a0its lucrative memory-chip business.Though\u00a0Friday\u2019s\u00a0agreement resolves some of the tension between Toshiba and Southern, it wasn\u2019t clear\u00a0if the Vogtle facility would be completed. In a separate development, a consultant to the Georgia Public Service Commission filed a report\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0that concluded that,\u00a0under several scenarios, it was \u201cnot economic\u201d to continue work on the Vogtle project.Staff of the state commission concluded\u00a0it made more sense to abandon construction of the facility and build an equivalent amount of natural gas-fired generation if natural gas prices remain low.\u00a0Even if gas prices rose, stopping work on the nuclear plant made economic sense under some scenarios.Southern didn\u2019t immediately respond to calls for comment\u00a0Friday.\u00a0The utility\u00a0and some of the state regulators have said they remain committed to completing the facility.After Westinghouse sought bankruptcy protection, Southern stepped in to continue paying the 6,000 workers working at the site. Westinghouse was building the plant for Southern on a fixed-cost contract, but after the bankruptcy filing the company said it wouldn\u2019t pay further costs. This triggered a parental guarantee from Toshiba.On Friday, Toshiba said it would pay Southern in installments starting later this year and running through January 2021.Regardless of the outcome,\u00a0building the\u00a0first new nuclear plant in the U.S. in three decades has proved considerably more difficult and expensive than originally expected. In 2011, Southern told Georgia regulators the project would cost a total of about $13 billion. In March, Mr. Fanning estimated the cost at $16 billion.Southern owns 45.7% of the project. The rest is split between Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and City of Dalton Utilities.Write to Russell Gold at russell.gold@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Deal Made on Southern Plant.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 19:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/toshiba-southern-reach-deal-on-troubled-u-s-nuclear-plant-1497067866", "news_title": "Toshiba to Cough Up $3.68 Billion to Finish Troubled U.S. Nuclear Plant ", "keywords": " cost overruns, nuclear power, nuclear reactors,southern, vogtle, westinghouse,Toshiba,6502.TO,Southern Co.,SO,Westinghouse Electric,Vogtle Electric Generating Plant,Thomas A.

The DUP said instead that talks centered on a so-called confidence-and-supply arrangement, a weaker and potentially more unstable partnership than a formal coalition.All the while, the clock has been counting down toward the start of divorce negotiations with the European Union slated for June 19, which European leaders say they expect will go ahead.\u201cWe\u2019re ready to roll,\u201d Irish Foreign Minister       Charlie Flanagan       said on Sunday in an interview with U.K. broadcaster ITV.Yet in Brussels, European officials preparing for talks on the timeline of the negotiations with their U.K. counterparts were wondering how meaningful talks can be. Mrs. May\u2019s failure to win an outright majority in a national election on Thursday has cast doubt on her future as prime minister.Boris Johnson,        the flamboyant, pro-Brexit foreign secretary beloved by party activists, on Saturday dismissed as \u201ctripe\u201d newspaper reports that he was already planning a bid to unseat Mrs. May. A survey of more than 1,000 U.K. adults by polling firm Survation published Sunday found 49% thought Mrs. May should quit.Jeremy Corbyn,        leader of the main opposition Labour Party, said he is ready to fight another election and expects one to be called this year or in early 2018.In broadcast interviews on Sunday, senior Conservative lawmakers said now isn\u2019t the right time for a leadership challenge, given the added uncertainty it would cause as Brexit talks get under way.\u201cThe last thing we need is further political upheaval,\u201d said Transport Secretary       Chris Grayling,        an ally of Mrs. May.But some said such a contest may need to happen soon.       Nicky Morgan,        a former education secretary who has clashed with Mrs. May, said she didn\u2019t think the prime minister should lead the party into another election and that a leadership contest should be considered this summer, or ahead of the party\u2019s annual conference in October.\u201cI think Theresa May is ultimately going to take responsibility,\u201d she said, referring to the election result. Mrs. Morgan said the party needs a proper contest to select a new leader rather than \u201ca coronation.\u201dDefense Secretary       Michael Fallon       on Sunday said that, meanwhile, Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet expects to have a greater say in government following the resignation of her two top aides, Nick Timothy and       Fiona Hill.       The two had played a central role in driving government policy and strategy and oversaw the botched election.\u201cWe are going to see I hope much more collective decision-making in government,\u201d he said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.George Osborne,        who served as Treasury chief in the administration of Conservative former Prime Minister       David Cameron,        was highly critical of Mrs. May. \u201cTheresa May is a dead woman walking\u2014it\u2019s just how long she\u2019s going to remain on death row,\u201d he said on the BBC.As well as calling into question Mrs. May\u2019s future, Thursday\u2019s election raises doubts about the party\u2019s ability to deliver on its legislative platform.The DUP\u2019s 10 seats in Parliament are enough to give the Conservatives, with 318, a slender majority in the 650-seat assembly. But the deal being discussed between the two sides falls short of a formal pact that would allow the Conservatives to rely on DUP support on every vote. That raises the prospect that Parliament could defeat or amend the Conservatives\u2019 plans on everything from Brexit to welfare and education.A confidence-and-supply arrangement means the DUP at a minimum would pledge to back the government in any future no-confidence motions in Parliament and to support its tax-and-spending plans, delivered in twice-yearly budgets debated by lawmakers. Governments in the U.K. must win such votes to stay in power. It isn\u2019t yet clear whether the arrangement will extend to other areas of policy as negotiations are continuing.A big question mark hangs over the government\u2019s Brexit strategy. The DUP says its priority is in preventing Brexit from causing any disruption to trade with EU member Ireland, a stance analysts say is incompatible with Mrs. May\u2019s pre-election position that she was prepared to walk away from talks without a deal.Mr. Corbyn said Conservative plans for a bill to alter or scrap EU legislation are probably also in tatters in the absence of the parliamentary majority needed to swiftly enact such a huge undertaking. He said his party plans to present its own alternative plan for government when Parliament reconvenes on June 19.Mrs. May on Sunday announced fresh appointments to her cabinet. She had been expected to make more-dramatic changes after the election but almost all senior officials remained in place, underscoring her limited room to maneuver.       Damian Green,        an ally, was named first secretary of state, her de facto deputy.       Michael Gove,        a leader of last year\u2019s Brexit campaign, was named environment secretary.Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'In U.K., Uncertainty Is the Only Sure Thing.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 18:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/theresa-may-faces-post-election-disquiet-1497191291", "news_title": "U.K. Faces Prolonged Political Uncertainty", "keywords": " boris johnson,brexit, conservatives, george osborne, may, theresa may, uk election, uk politics,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "In September, IEX Group Inc. threw a party at Manhattan\u2019s Bowery Hotel to celebrate becoming a full-fledged stock exchange.The party had guests from high-speed trading firms such as Citadel Securities LLC, Global Trading Systems LLC, IMC Financial Markets and             KCG Holdings Inc.,       people familiar with the situation said. They came even though IEX vaulted to fame by crusading against ultrafast traders who use computers to exploit slower investors.IEX could use their help. Nearly a year after winning approval to become an exchange, it is struggling to become more than a niche player.Made famous by       Michael Lewis\u2019s       2014 book \u201cFlash Boys,\u201d IEX hasn\u2019t made a dent in the businesses of the New York Stock Exchange,             Nasdaq Inc.       and Bats, each of which handles roughly one-fifth of U.S. equities volume. In May, it had a market share of 2.2%.IEX becoming an exchange \u201chas largely been a nonevent,\u201d said       Bryan Harkins,        head of U.S. equities and global FX at             CBOE Holdings Inc.,       which owns Bats.When IEX raised funds three years ago, it told backers it planned to reach more than 8% market share by 2017. That estimate was based on winning exchange approval in 2015, said an IEX spokesman, who declined to provide updated targets. IEX didn\u2019t get approved until June 2016 because opposition from other exchanges and trading firms dragged out the process.Since then, it has fought to gain traction against entrenched practices and powerful incumbents. Its representatives have also visited major high-speed trading firms to get them to trade more on IEX.       Rob Salman,        an IEX salesman, met with Citadel Securities as recently as Friday, two people familiar with the situation said.IEX says it doesn\u2019t offer special perks to high-frequency trading or HFT firms. \u201cWe are fair access, and willing to meet with all of our members,\u201d a spokesman said.Around half of U.S. equities volume comes from HFT firms, which buy and sell shares in the blink of an eye. Such firms do most of their trading on the major exchanges, which offer incentives to brokers and high-volume traders.IEX calls itself the best exchange for investors, citing data showing that trades on IEX have less impact on prices than at other exchanges. Other exchanges don\u2019t dispute the numbers but say IEX\u2019s analysis misses a key point of what an exchange does: providing public data on stock prices.Before becoming an exchange last year, IEX was a dark pool, where orders to buy and sell stocks aren\u2019t publicly broadcast. Today, about one-quarter of IEX\u2019s volume is displayed. That means the best posted price for a stock is more likely to be found elsewhere.In April, IEX\u2019s quotes for the most heavily traded stocks matched or beat other exchanges\u2019 prices 31% of the time, according to an analysis by advisory firm ViableMkts LLC and data provider MayStreet LLC. By comparison, Nasdaq\u2019s flagship exchange displayed the best price 89% of the time and NYSE\u2019s Arca exchange had it 78% of the time.IEX argues it shouldn\u2019t be judged by its displayed prices. It says it is more important to offer quality executions to long-term investors, a core group that IEX says other exchanges have forgotten.One of the biggest factors limiting IEX\u2019s market share is its refusal to pay rebates\u2014the incentives other exchanges pay for orders.NYSE, Nasdaq and Bats paid more than $2 billion last year in rebates, according to company filings. Defenders of the practice say it results in more competitive pricing. IEX says it encourages brokers to send orders to the exchange that pays the biggest rebate, rather than the one that is optimal for the customer.\u201cWe\u2019re unwilling to pay kickbacks,\u201d IEX Chief Executive Officer       Brad Katsuyama       said.But that makes it tough to boost volumes. \u201cThey\u2019re in a bit of a dilemma because they\u2019ve made not paying rebates a religious issue,\u201d said       Jamil Nazarali,        senior adviser to the CEO of Citadel Securities, which opposed IEX\u2019s exchange application.IEX, whose backers include venture-capital firm Spark Capital and buy-side firms such as the Capital Group and Brandes Investment Partners, is exploring other ways to grow.One of those is a big bet on corporate listings. If the plan wins approval, companies listed on NYSE or Nasdaq could switch to IEX as early as October.That would lift IEX\u2019s volumes, because the exchange that lists a stock runs its daily opening and closing auctions, which account for a significant chunk of trading. Listing fees also brought more than half a billion dollars last year in revenues to NYSE\u2019s parent company,             Intercontinental Exchange Inc.,       and Nasdaq.At least 10 companies, including some members of the S&P 500, have expressed interest in switching to IEX, The Wall Street Journal reported in November.Still, IEX faces an uphill battle. \u201cIt\u2019s a real challenge to build a successful listing operation,\u201d said       Eric Noll,        former CEO of brokerage Convergex and a member of an IEX outside advisory committee. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen overnight.\u201dCompetition is also heating up. Rivals have borrowed IEX\u2019s ideas, including its best-known feature\u2014the \u201cspeed bump\u201d, a delay of 350 microseconds imposed on each incoming trade. The delay ensures there isn\u2019t a better price on another exchange.In July, NYSE plans to introduce its own 350-microsecond speed bump to the smallest of its equities exchanges. Mr. Katsuyama dismisses the copycat threat, saying it is a \u201cdistraction\u201d from other NYSE practices that harm investors.This month Bats also introduced an IEX-style pricing model on one of its exchanges.IEX has worked to keep up with evolving HFT strategies. Several years ago, it observed that ultrafast traders were predicting price changes milliseconds before they happened. The strategy, which IEX calls \u201ccrumbling quote arbitrage,\u201d means slower traders will often sell a stock just before its price ticks up a penny, or buy just before it drops.\u201cIt ends up being a multibillion-dollar transference of wealth in a very, very small period of time,\u201d Mr. Katsuyama said.In response, IEX expanded its defensive arsenal, introducing a tool called the discretionary peg order type or the \u201cD-Peg.\u201dD-peg is an \u201ceffective tool\u201d to avoid getting picked off before price changes, said       Anthony Godonis,        head of trading for the Americas at             Aberdeen Asset Management,       which manages $385 billion.IEX \u201copened people\u2019s eyes to some of the improprieties that have occurred in the past,\u201d Mr. Godonis said. \u201cAnd that has been great for market structure.\u201dWhether it is great for IEX remains to be seen.Write to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'IEX Finds Tough Slog To Upend Status Quo.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 17:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/despite-hopes-flash-boys-heroes-are-far-from-reshaping-u-s-stock-market-1497178804", "news_title": "Despite Hopes, \u2018Flash Boys\u2019 Heroes Are Far From Reshaping U.S. Stock Market ", "keywords": " bats, brad katsuyama, cboe, exchange, flash boys,hft, high-frequency trading, high-speed trading,iex, iex group,intercontinental exchange, michael lewis, nasdaq, new york stock exchange, nyse, stock exchanges, stock markets, trading,trading volume,IEX Group,Aberdeen Asset Management,ADN.LN,Brandes Investment Partners,Intercontinental Exchange,ICE,New York Stock Exchange,NYSE,Global Trading Systems,CBOE Holdings,CBOE,Citadel Securities,KCG Holdings,KCG,Nasdaq,IMC Financial Markets,Bats,corporate,industrial news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,security brokering,dealing,online brokers,after hours trading,securities,commodity exchange activities,alternative investments,financial services,hedge funds,investing"}, {"content": "Donald Trump       has ordered a \u201cnational security\u201d review of steel imports with a goal of justifying a broad-based tariff. If his advisers look honestly at the evidence, they can\u2019t possibly find enough to justify such a job-killing, economically harmful policy.Start with the fact that U.S. steel prices are already higher than in the rest of the world, and the gap has significantly widened over the past five years amid increased import duties. In 2012 the average price of cold-rolled coil produced in the U.S. was 11.5% and 12.1% higher than the Chinese and Southern European equivalent. This year U.S.-made steel is 34% and 27% more expensive, respectively.American steel makers cry \u201cdumping,\u201d but is every foreign company in every country dumping? The Commerce Department has already imposed 152 antidumping or countervailing-duty orders on imports from 32 countries, and many more cases are pending. Commerce charged South Korea and Turkey with dumping welded line pipe in 2015 and last year slapped duties on imported cut-to-length steel plate from China, Brazil and Turkey. Antidumping duties contributed to a 25% decline in foreign imports between 2015 and 2016.Domestic steel makers have exploited these protectionist measures to raise prices and boost their bottom lines. Last year             Nucor                   posted an 11.9% profit before taxes, depreciation and amortization.             AK Steel\u2019s       margins have doubled in two years to 8.5% while             Steel Dynamics\u2019s       has increased by half to about 15%.Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross       nonetheless says that antidumping duties are \u201cnot able to resolve the broader structural economic harm to the U.S. steel industry caused by massive global overcapacity and unfair foreign competition.\u201d His beef is that China, which accounted for nearly half of the world\u2019s output last year, has driven down global prices and increased pressure on U.S. steel companies.The reality is that foreign competition forced the U.S. steel industry to become more efficient\u2014or at least it did before the tariff walls began going up. Over the past four decades, production has shifted from unionized integrated mills that use blast furnaces and iron ore to lower-cost mini-mills that employ electric arc furnaces, scrap metal and non-unionized labor. Steel from integrated mills makes up a third of domestic production, down from about three-quarters in 1980.Domestic manufacturers that were slow to adapt like Bethlehem Steel have gone out of business while leaner steel makers that have embraced new technologies are prospering. In April             U.S. Steel                   slashed its annual profit forecast to invest in retrofitting decades-old mills. Improvements in technology and workflow are the main reasons the U.S. steel workforce has shrunk\u2014and survived an onslaught of competition.Yet U.S. foundries are still running at only 71% capacity while imports make up a quarter of the U.S. market. One reason is that most advances in high-strength steel have occurred overseas. Many downstream consumers say domestic steel doesn\u2019t meet industry quality or safety standards. Mini-mills produce lower-grade metal that\u2019s suitable for roads and buildings, but not as much for automotive sheet or appliances.This excess capacity should moot natural security concerns. Defense consumes less than 3% of domestic steel, and U.S. foundries would have plenty of spare capacity to ramp up production in wartime. Canada, South Korea and Mexico accounted for 40% of imports last year, while China and Russia together provided 7%.The greatest harm from broad-based steel tariffs would be to the thousands of American businesses and workers that use steel. These would include the higher cost of American steel for construction (42% of steel shipments), automotive (27%) and machinery (9%). Public works and homes would cost more to build.Many U.S. companies that compete globally would risk losing business to overseas competitors. Some would turn to substitute materials such as plastic or aluminum, tweak their supply chains or move production overseas. Auto makers would likely utilize more high-strength aluminum and shift more production to Mexico and Canada. American steel workers could even be harmed if demand for steel drops as users adapt to higher prices.There are 16 times more workers employed today in U.S. steel-consuming industries than the 150,000 or so American steelworkers. A study by economists       Joseph Francois       and       Laura Baughman       found that more American workers lost jobs (200,000) after       George W. Bush       imposed steel tariffs in 2002 than were employed in the entire steel industry at the time (187,500). The result was $4 billion in lost wages.The case against steel tariffs is so overwhelming that it\u2019s hard to believe even Mr. Ross can find a way to justify it. The motivation could only be to assist the politically clamorous owners of a handful of steel companies that would exploit government favoritism to raise prices. The losers would be millions of the so-called forgotten men and women the President vowed to help during his campaign.Appeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Steel-Trapped Minds.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 17:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-steel-trapped-minds-1497215549", "news_title": "Trump\u2019s Steel-Trapped Minds", "keywords": "china,dumping,free trade,mexico,protectionism,russia,steel,steel industry,tariffs,marketing,markets,corporate,industry imports,industrial news,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,trade barriers,editorials,primary metals,iron,ferroalloys,basic materials,resources"}, {"content": "OAKLAND, Calif.\u2014      LeBron James       is stressed out. That\u2019s the easiest way to understand how good the Golden State Warriors are. They stress out the greatest basketball player of his generation.The Warriors once again have a 3-1 lead on the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals with a shot to win the championship in Game 5 on Monday night. The Cavs avoided a sweep and spoiled Golden State\u2019s bid for a perfect 16-0 postseason, but now they have to win three more games. That\u2019s as stressful as the NBA gets. It\u2019s enough for a weeklong trip to a day spa.But here\u2019s the thing: While the Warriors are beating the Cavaliers, they\u2019re not beating LeBron James. Cleveland has actually outscored Golden State with James on the court, and what makes that even wilder is that James has been on the court for almost the entire series.Golden State is winning not because it\u2019s stopped James, but rather because James hasn\u2019t played every minute of every game. The fact that he\u2019s not a known cyborg may be his only flaw in these Finals. James is averaging a triple-double of 31.8 points, 11.8 rebounds and 10.5 assists\u2014and it isn\u2019t even his most incomprehensible statistical accomplishment.That would be this one: James has played 166 minutes, and the Cavs have won those minutes by six points; James has rested for 26 minutes, and the Cavs have lost those minutes by 25 points. They outscore the Warriors by 1.1 points per 100 possessions with him. They\u2019re outscored by the Warriors by 47.9 points per 100 possessions without him.James is the only Cleveland player with a positive point differential against the Warriors. His incredible value is obvious. For some perspective, though, it helps to look at Kyrie Irving, who\u2019s played almost as much as James and has the worst plus-minus of anyone on either team in the Finals.Games 3 and 4 last week only confirmed how much they depend on James. The Cavs won the 46 minutes he played in Game 3 by seven points, but they lost because they lost the other two minutes by 12 points. James made sure that didn\u2019t happen in Game 4. The Cavaliers were 32 points better than the Warriors with James on the court\u2014which is why it didn\u2019t matter the Warriors were 11 points better when he was on the bench.So the existential question for the Cavs as they face three more elimination games is how long they can get away with not playing their only essential player.

The charges, announced last Thursday after the men were arrested June 1, show that Iran\u2019s terror proxies roam far beyond the Middle East.The FBI and New York Police Department carried out the investigation, which resulted in a raft of terror-related charges for naturalized citizens       Ali Kourani       of the Bronx and       Samer el Debek       of Dearborn, Mich. Prosecutors say Hezbollah recruited the men as \u201coperatives,\u201d provided them with \u201cmilitary-style training,\u201d then gave them a variety of ominous tasks.Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York say the 32-year-old Mr. Kourani conducted \u201cpre-operational surveillance\u201d of military and law-enforcement sites around New York as well as Kennedy Airport. The feds allege that Mr. Debek, age 37, staked out targets in Panama that included the American and Israeli embassies as well as the Panama Canal. Attorneys for the two men did not respond to media inquiries.Mr. Debek\u2019s alleged Panamanian operations are consistent with Hezbollah\u2019s presence across Latin America that goes back to the bombings of the Israeli embassy and a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, in 1992 and 1994 respectively, killing more than 100 people.In 2011 U.S. investigators foiled a plot to kill the Saudi ambassador at a Washington restaurant, leading to a guilty plea by the would-be assassin. Hezbollah was also behind a 2012 bus bombing in Bulgaria that killed five Israeli tourists and their local bus driver.Iran bankrolls Hezbollah to the tune of $200 million annually and provides most of the 80,000 missiles the group points at Israel.

If Democrats believe the lesson of ObamaCare is that the government should have even more control over health care, then why not show how it would work in the liberal paradise?The legislation guarantees free government-run health care for California\u2019s 39 million residents\u2014no co-pays, deductibles or insurance premiums\u2014as well as virtually unlimited benefits. Patients could see any specialist without a referral and receive any treatment that their provider says is medically appropriate. Democrats seem to believe this will have no effect on the incentive to use health care.A University of Massachusetts Amherst study commissioned by the California Nurses Association\u2014which favors government-run health care\u2014claims that single-payer would reduce health-care spending by $37.5 billion a year. This miracle would be achieved largely by slashing administrative costs as well as provider and drug reimbursement rates. According to the study, letting people get treated whenever and wherever they want would save money. We don\u2019t think       Jonathan Gruber       did this study, but he could have.The study also asserts that California could reallocate $225 billion a year in Medicaid, Medicare and ObamaCare spending for single-payer assuming a federal waiver. Thus the legislature would only have to come up with $107 billion.The Senate didn\u2019t pass the bill with a funding mechanism, leaving that to the Assembly. The Senate appropriations committee contemplated a 15% payroll tax, but the nurses\u2019 study suggests instead a 2.3-percentage point increase in the state sales tax (to 9.55%, not including local add-ons) and a 2.3% business gross receipts tax on revenue exceeding $2 million. The latter would be baked into the cost of everything from a taco to a Tesla.

For a year, the FBI has been looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and apparently there was not enough evidence to make Mr. Trump a target. That news should put to rest\u2014as the president had hoped\u2014an allegation that, if true, would undoubtedly have caused even Republicans in Congress to consider impeachment.But Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony has put another question on the table: whether the president attempted to obstruct justice. According to Mr. Comey, he met with Mr. Trump privately in the Oval Office while the FBI was investigating former national security adviser       Mike Flynn.       \u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this thing go,\u201d Mr. Comey says the president told him. The former FBI chief testified that the president also asked him for \u201cloyalty.\u201d Mr. Trump later fired Mr. Comey, possibly because he had not shown it.As this national obsession continues, there will be heated discussions about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s statements and actions, and the surrounding circumstances, were an effort to obstruct justice. The answer: Given what we know, there is very little chance Special Counsel       Robert Mueller       will bring an obstruction charge.For one thing, the facts are ambiguous. Yes, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey to abandon the investigation of Mr. Flynn, but he didn\u2019t order it\u2014something that, as president, he had the authority to do. As Mr. Comey remembered the president\u2019s request, it was couched as a wish: \u201cI hope you can see your way clear\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d Similarly, the president\u2019s desire for loyalty is not unusual. All presidents expect loyalty from those in their administrations. The executive branch cannot function if subordinates are not loyal to the president. Leaks are evidence of this.In addition, Mr. Comey reported Mr. Trump said several things that are inconsistent with an intent to disrupt the investigation generally. The most serious part of the inquiry relates to the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Russians\u2014clearly an impeachable offense if it occurred with Mr. Trump\u2019s knowledge or direction. Mr. Comey reports Mr. Trump as saying \u201cif there were some \u2018satellite\u2019 associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out.\u201d That clearly indicates Mr. Trump was not trying to keep the FBI from investigating the Russia collusion issue.These factual ambiguities alone make the case for obstruction of justice far less than clear-cut. Legal and political considerations militate in the same direction.There is a strong argument that, as a matter of law, the president cannot be criminally guilty of obstructing justice if he simply orders the FBI director not to investigate someone. All appointed officials are the president\u2019s subordinates, and he is responsible for, and has authority over, their actions.Under this conventional analysis of the executive branch, the president is authorized to direct or countermand investigations or prosecutions by the Justice Department, which acts on his authority alone. Thus, the president cannot be guilty of obstruction of justice unless he attempts to obstruct an investigation of himself, as in Watergate.We don\u2019t know how many times past presidents have instructed the Justice Department to prosecute, or not, a criminal case. When the House voted in 2012 to hold President       Obama\u2019s       attorney general,       Eric Holder,        in contempt for failing to turn over documents, who directed that he not be prosecuted? It is not publicly known how often this happens, but Mr. Mueller and the rest of the professionals in the Justice Department certainly know. That adds further ambiguity to Mr. Mueller\u2019s decision.The idea that on this limited evidence Mr. Mueller would find the president obstructed justice, and thus set in motion proceedings that could unseat the winner of a presidential election, is a dream of the \u201cresistance,\u201d but it is not credible. The smartest thing ever said about Mr. Comey\u2019s approach to the       Hillary Clinton       email issue\u2014shaming her in public but refusing to recommend prosecution of what was clearly a serious crime\u2014was that the FBI director did not want to make a decision that would determine the outcome of the 2016 election. Similarly, Mr. Mueller probably will scold Mr. Trump for his actions, which certainly violated normal Washington protocol, but say ultimately that prosecution is not warranted.There isn\u2019t even much for Mr. Mueller to investigate. Only two people are involved, Messrs. Trump and Comey, and the latter\u2019s testimony is the only evidence Mr. Mueller needs. He could make the decision promptly, allowing the president and Congress to turn to the important domestic and foreign issues America faces. Mr. Comey\u2019s failure before last week to acknowledge publicly that Mr. Trump was not a target of the Russia probe shows the damage unnecessary delay can do.What might have foreclosed this favorable outcome, however, is the president\u2019s unnecessary challenge Friday to Mr. Comey\u2019s account. Never one to leave well enough alone, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Comey of lying and offered to give his own testimony. That sets up a conflict that the media will treat as a test of Mr. Trump\u2019s honesty. Unless there are tapes\u2014which would raise even more questions\u2014this is a challenge the president will lose. His exculpatory recollections under oath, whatever they are, will not be more credible than Mr. Comey\u2019s contemporaneous memorandums.If that is Mr. Mueller\u2019s finding, the president will have given his enemies the priceless opportunity to claim he lied under oath, an impeachable offense\u2014at least in Republican eyes when President Clinton was in the dock.But the situation is not irretrievable. Mr. Mueller could still say the president\u2019s testimony would change nothing and need not be taken, since Mr. Comey\u2019s statements and memorandums simply do not make out a case of obstruction. Mr. Mueller would face merciless media and Democratic criticism for cutting this circus short. But if he is the man of integrity everyone has averred, he will follow this course for the good of the country.Mr. Wallison is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

Politico reports the leading contender is       Michael Pack,        a conservative filmmaker and president of the Claremont Institute. Whoever gets the job faces an uphill battle to reform an agency that has lost its sense of mission.To get a feel for the dysfunction, consider Radio Farda, the Persian-language component of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. With an annual budget of $117 million, RFE/RL is supposed to serve as a surrogate press in 23 countries across Europe and Asia that restrict media freedom. Farda is one of its most important broadcasters, intended to give Iranians a rigorous, fair and morally credible alternative to propaganda from Tehran.But Farda too often fails to deliver. Nowhere is this more apparent than in its treatment of Israel. Here\u2019s how it recounted a Palestinian attack that took place March 19, 2016, amid last year\u2019s stabbing intifada: \u201cIsraeli media, quoting security officials, claimed that       Abdullah Ajlouni,        a 20-year-old youth, had, as Israeli media put it, approached several Israeli soldiers in a \u2018suspicious manner,\u2019 and \u2018had tried to attack them.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn fact, Israeli forces didn\u2019t open fire on Ajlouni merely because he had acted suspicious. Ajlouni had pulled a knife and stabbed one of the soldiers before they opened fire.The story went on to claim that       Ahmad Dawabsheh,        a 6-year-old Palestinian boy who eight months earlier survived an arson attack by hard-line Israeli settlers, had been \u201ctransferred to Spain for treatment of wounds sustained in the flames, and Israel still hasn\u2019t arrested anyone on suspicion of carrying out the attack.\u201dAgain, incorrect. Israel had two months earlier indicted two Jews, charging one with murder over the attack, which killed Ahmad\u2019s parents and 18-month-old brother. Iranians relying on Farda to understand these events were given the false impression that Israel is a place where Jews kill Arabs with impunity.       Nenad Pejic,        a former Balkan correspondent who now serves as RFE/RL\u2019s Prague-based editor-in-chief, conceded in an email that the stabbing story that also discussed the Dawabsheh case had been \u201cinaccurate.\u201dHere\u2019s a Farda headline, from a March 10, 2016, news brief: \u201cThree Palestinians and One American Killed in Clashes in Israel.\u201d The implication of saying that Palestinians were killed in impersonal \u201cclashes\u201d is that unmentioned Israelis hover in the background as potential culprits. It is only in the second paragraph that the story identifies the attacker as a \u201cPalestinian man.\u201d Omitted altogether is that the \u201cclashes\u201d started after he began stabbing mainly Jewish civilians.Such obfuscation of assailants\u2019 and victims\u2019 identities reinforces the frame, familiar to Iranians from their own media, in which Israelis are always aggressors. Mr. Pejic acknowledged that this story was \u201cincomplete.\u201dStill another article, published in February 2017, concerned Israel\u2019s decision to deny a visa to a researcher with Human Rights Watch. The story failed to note that the researcher had participated in the movement to boycott the Jewish state\u2014context Iranians deserved to know.Mr. Pejic countered that a three-paragraph squib didn\u2019t allow room for elaboration. Yet Farda published a second, much longer story on this incident that still didn\u2019t divulge the researcher\u2019s anti-Israel views.Then there is Farda\u2019s coverage of President       Obama\u2019s       nuclear diplomacy. At least five stories, published between 2012 and 2017, described critics of Mr. Obama\u2019s engagement with Tehran as \u201cextremists\u201d and their views of Iranian realities as \u201camateurish.\u201dThe extremists in question included Sen.       John McCain,        congressional opponents of the deal generally, GOP aides on Capitol Hill, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.Mr. Pejic said the label \u201cextremist\u201d was \u201cmisused\u201d with respect to Mr. McCain in a 2012 article. But he said the other instances arose from quotes, or came from opinion pieces, or were otherwise \u201cin line with the kind of political observation frequently found in news analysis.\u201dYet RFE/RL couldn\u2019t point to any instances in which Democrats or supporters of the deal were labeled \u201cextremists\u201d\u2014or with other pejoratives like \u201cpeaceniks\u201d or \u201chippies.\u201d As a taxpayer-funded broadcaster, RFE/RL has a particular duty to refrain from partisanship when reporting on American politics.Perhaps most dismaying are the stories that seem to be borrowed wholesale from state-run Iranian media.An April 2016 Farda headline quoted President       Hassan Rouhani       to the effect that \u201cIf It Weren\u2019t for Iran\u2019s Assistance, ISIS would Have Captured Baghdad and Damascus.\u201d Another, from November 2016, read: \u201cIran\u2019s Deputy President Visits Shiite Festival in Iraq.\u201d Like any item that might appear in Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, these U.S.-funded stories deferentially quoted one Iranian official after another without offering context or any alternative view.

One reason       Bill Clinton       was able to make a name for himself decades ago was that previous candidates had the grace to get out of the way.       Jimmy Carter       and       Walter Mondale       and       Michael Dukakis       weren\u2019t trying to place themselves at center stage during the campaign of 1992.

Morale was low. Training was deficient. Weapons and equipment didn\u2019t work. Good people left the armed services in droves. At the same time the world was growing more dangerous, with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Iranian revolution and hostage crisis, and multiple nations falling to communism.A decade later the situation had turned around. How did America go from the hollow military of the 1970s to the strength that helped drive the Soviet Union out of existence? Are there lessons we could apply today?A few months ago the vice chiefs from each branch of the military appeared before the House Armed Services Committee, which I lead. Their testimony certainly got my attention. Only three of the Army\u2019s 58 Brigade Combat Teams are \u201cready to fight tonight.\u201d More than half the Navy\u2019s airplanes cannot fly because they are awaiting maintenance and spare parts. The Air Force is short 1,500 pilots and 3,000 mechanics, and its fleet is older and smaller than ever. All that is alarming enough, but what surprised me most was testimony that pilots today get fewer training hours in the cockpit than during the dire days of the 1970s.How did this happen? Since 2010 the defense budget has been cut by more than 20%, but the world has not become 20% safer. To get planes, ships and equipment ready to deploy to the Middle East or elsewhere, the military has had to take parts off other planes, ships and units. This cannibalization has diminished American readiness. The military is not prepared to carry out all the missions it may be asked to do in time of war.What is the answer? Rebuilding the military after the 1970s took serious and sustained effort. When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, the Carter administration raised defense spending by 12% in 1979 and 15% in 1980.Ronald Reagan       added even more: 17% in 1981 and 18% in 1982. After that the rate of growth slowed a bit, but in all there were five straight years of double-digit increases followed by three more of nearly 10%. At that point the defense budget was about 6% of America\u2019s gross domestic product. Today it is only 3.1%.Repairing the damage done to the military in our time will require a similar sort of response. It is wrong to send brave men and women out on missions for which they are not fully prepared or without the best equipment the nation can produce.President       Trump       has committed to rebuilding America\u2019s military, but his first budget proposal does not follow through on that promise. Admittedly, very few of his Pentagon appointees were in place to help write the budget. Still, the proposal he sent to Congress for next year adds to defense spending a mere 3% above President       Obama\u2019s       last budget. Although it may stop the bleeding, it won\u2019t do much to help the military get well.At the same time, the Pentagon needs to get better value for the money its spends. Outdated acquisition systems result in wasted dollars and delays in getting our troops the weapons and equipment they need. That is why defense reform has been, and will continue to be, such a high priority for the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.But fixing the military\u2019s planes and ships cannot wait until the budget is balanced. America\u2019s military personnel need those tools now. Few remember how fierce the opposition was to the defense buildup of the 1980s. But looking back President Reagan\u2019s policy was obviously the right one\u2014for those who served and for the good of mankind.I hope that 30 years from now they can say we did the right thing as well.Mr. Thornberry, a Texas Republican, is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.", "news_time": "2017-06-11 16:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-trump-budget-still-shortchanges-the-military-1497213634", "news_title": "The Trump Budget Still Shortchanges The Military", "keywords": " armed forces, budget, buildup,donald trump, military, pentagon, rebuild, ronald reagan,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Colombian President       Juan Manuel Santos       decreed a land reform on May 29 as part of the 2016 settlement he made with the narcoterrorist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in Havana. It parallels a similar project in Venezuela imposed by the late dictator Hugo       Ch\u00e1vez       that has caused dire food shortages. Both approaches are right out of Cuba\u2019s totalitarian playbook.The Castro dictatorship has been declared on the verge of collapse more than once since 1959, when it first began executing anyone it suspected of lacking revolutionary fervor. Not only has it survived, but since 1999 it has expanded its empire to include Venezuela. Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua have become Cuban satellite states. Now it\u2019s taking Colombia. Or more accurately, after more than six decades of Marxist-inspired terrorism, Colombia decided to surrender in Havana.The Obama administration was an accomplice. It was either too gullible or too leftist to object to an agreement that is almost certain to destroy Colombian liberty and impoverish the nation.The Colombian democracy is already wounded, as evidenced by Mr. Santos\u2019s decision to make the FARC agreement law even though the voters rejected it in a national plebiscite. He also placed it above the constitution. To implement it, the Santos-controlled Congress granted him rule-by-decree powers much like what Ch\u00e1vez got from his National Assembly.The land reform is the product of those powers and will advance the full FARC takeover of the country\u2019s institutions. As FARC leader       Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez       asserted in an October 2012 speech in Oslo, \u201cThe concept of land is inextricably linked to territory.\u201d They \u201care an indivisible whole that go beyond the mere agrarian aspect and touch vital strategic interests.\u201dThose interests are eventual iron-fisted control of the country. It is why the FARC demanded, in Havana, that the government claim arbitrary powers to expropriate land and redistribute it. Under Mr. Santos\u2019s decree the state will rule on whether there is an illegal concentration of land and local committees will decide when the use of private property is not meeting social or ecological interests. Courts are sidelined; property is taken administratively.In a May 17, 2007, story about Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s land reform, Journal reporter Jos\u00e9 de C\u00f3rdoba explained how a similar decision to break up large ranches produced an agricultural disaster in Venezuela.The rural areas where FARC has concentrated for transition to civilian life are also areas where there will be new property titling. Those same zones are slated to become congressional districts, where newly-minted FARC politicians, flush with weapons and cash, probably will be the only ones on the ballot.There is no reason to trust the FARC. It agreed to turn in its weapons, itemize its assets, and turn them over to the government to compensate its many victims. The terrorists were to account for the thousands of child soldiers they have recruited to use as sex slaves and cannon fodder. The \u201cpunishment\u201d for these atrocities is supposed to be restricted movement in rural areas for at least five years.But the FARC has missed the deadline for arms surrender, there is no mechanism to verify full disarmament and many FARC weapons are in Venezuela. The child soldiers are still unaccounted for.The war criminals have not been confined to designated areas as Mr. Santos promised. The Economist magazine reported in May that \u201c60 FARC leaders already have a license to roam the country, popping up at events in universities or at the Bogot\u00e1 book fair with an arrogant message of political victory.\u201d That arrogance was on display on June 3, when       Jes\u00fas Santrich       and another FARC honcho burst uninvited into Senate chambers during a session.The narcotrafficking leadership claims it is penniless. But in a June 4 interview with Noticias Caracol, Attorney General       N\u00e9stor Humberto Mart\u00ednez       said that his office has uncovered evidence of FARC assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars that he pledged to collect. \u201cThat legend of Franciscan poverty,\u201d he said referring to an image the FARC has long cultivated, \u201cis about to end.\u201dFARC leader Ivan M\u00e1rquez responded with a threat via             Twitter                  : Mr. Mart\u00ednez, he wrote, is \u201copenly and desperately seeking the failure of the peace process.\u201d He posted a Mart\u00ednez caricature sitting down to eat a dead dove of peace and asking the waiter to serve him a \u201cbloody quarter.\u201dFARC terrorists already call shots in Congress. Last month Sen.       Armando Benedetti       warned that if his candidate for an open seat on the constitutional court was not confirmed, the FARC would walk away from the agreement. The candidate was confirmed.Fidel Castro       gave up the armed struggle in the late 1990s and coached Ch\u00e1vez to gain and consolidate power via democratic institutions.

Last month the world\u2019s top-ranked player of Go, an abstract strategy board game, lost to Google\u2019s AlphaGo program. This marked a major achievement for machine learning, given the game\u2019s complexity.What might be more important, though, went less noticed: Around the same time, some of the world\u2019s top Go players began competing alongside the AlphaGo program in human-machine teams. The players learned new strategies by studying AlphaGo\u2019s previous games and said working with the program gave them new confidence. This suggests a different way to think about the coming era of artificial intelligence.Most computer scientists agree that predictions about robots stealing jobs are greatly exaggerated. Rather than worrying about an impending Singularity, consider instead what we might call Multiplicity: diverse groups of people and machines working together to solve problems.Multiplicity is not science fiction. A combination of machine learning, the wisdom of crowds, and cloud computing already underlies tasks Americans perform every day: searching for documents, filtering spam emails, translating between languages, finding news and movies, navigating maps, and organizing photos and videos.Consider Google\u2019s search engine. It runs on a set of algorithms with input from a large number of human users who share valuable feedback every time they click on or skip over a link. The same is true for spam filters. Every time someone marks an email as spam or overrides a filter, it helps fine-tune the system for determining what is relevant.Multiplicity allows Amazon to recommend books,             Netflix                   to suggest movies, and             Facebook                   to organize newsfeed posts. Millions of people show their preferences by clicking, and that data is used to build and maintain statistical models that predict what users want. The key is clustering people and products, which allows the algorithm to make recommendations under the assumption that similar people have similar tastes. A continuing stream of human interaction ensures that the system evolves as new items are introduced and as tastes change.While scientists still don\u2019t understand Multiplicity very well, they are discovering clear benefits to machine diversity. Researchers have developed a family of techniques known as \u201censemble learning,\u201d in which a set of specialized algorithms work together to produce a single result. One variant, known as \u201crandom forests,\u201d was developed by Leo Breiman and       Adele Cutler       at the University of California, Berkeley. They proved that in complex problems with noisy data, a group of \u201cdecision trees\u201d will always outperform a single tree\u2014so long as the trees are sufficiently diverse.By the same token, the benefits and challenges of human diversity have been recognized for centuries in political science, economics and sociology. Experiments on group problem-solving show that the diversity of the people involved is more important than their total IQ. Perhaps the most exciting area of machine learning is deep learning, in which millions of parameters are tuned based on diverse training examples of speech or images that have been labeled by people.In robotics, too, the exciting progress, especially in autonomous driving, can be characterized in terms of Multiplicity. Data from a varied group of human drivers is combined to demonstrate appropriate responses to varying conditions, and to train multiple statistical machine-learning algorithms that run on distributed hardware. The systems must be continuously updated and fine-tuned based on changes in road, weather and traffic conditions, and as human expectations evolve. All this requires a continuing feedback cycle with people at the core.Collective intelligence with AI enables many of the most sophisticated and effective systems in use today. If people stopped providing input, these systems would quickly become outdated and would deteriorate. Despite years of experience in human factors and human-machine interfaces, more research is needed on the best ways to combine diverse groups of people with diverse groups of machines. The important question is not when machines will surpass human intelligence, but how humans can work together with them in new ways.Multiplicity is collaborative instead of combative. Rather than discourage the human workers of the world, this new frontier has the potential to empower them.Mr. Goldberg, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, is director of the People and Robots Initiative.", "news_time": "2017-06-11 16:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-robot-human-alliance-1497213576", "news_title": "The Robot-Human Alliance", "keywords": " ai, artificial intelligence, human, jobs, machine, multiplicity,robot, singularity,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "The U.S. has long played favorites with Earth\u2019s planetary neighbors. It operates exploration rovers on Mars but has ignored Venus for years. Even       Barack Obama       and       Donald Trump       agree on the importance of a human mission to Mars, yet each has remained silent on Venus. Even though Mars is farther from Earth, why has it managed to push Venus off the radar screen?The American infatuation with Mars has a lot to do with its potential to support life. Mars is half the size of Earth and home to a flimsy atmosphere, a frigid climate and horrendous dust storms. But the red planet might have harbored microbes long ago, and it could play host to well-equipped astronauts in the not-too-distant future.Venus\u2019s inhospitability wasn\u2019t always a given. As recently as the 1960s, some scientists thought Venus would be like Earth because it is similar in size, mass and composition. The Soviet engineers who designed Venera-4, the first spacecraft to penetrate the Venusian haze 50 years ago, geared it for flotation in case of a water landing. But the probe perished before it reached the planet\u2019s surface, after encountering hellish temperatures, bone-crushing pressure, and sulfuric-acid clouds.Earth and Venus may have resembled each other long ago but diverged. Farther from the sun, Earth held on to much of its water, while early oceans on Venus boiled off into space. As carbon dioxide built up in the Venusian atmosphere, it trapped more heat, triggering a runaway greenhouse effect and present-day temperatures hot enough to melt lead.Even though conditions on Venus are uninviting, scientists searching for potentially habitable planets around other stars are keen to understand how two similar worlds turned out so differently. Researchers want to learn how its surface is rejuvenated geologically, and why Venus spins in the opposite direction to the other planets. Scientists aren\u2019t sure how active its volcanoes are or whether it has lightning. They are also puzzled as to why clouds whip around the planet every four Earth days, at super-hurricane speeds, but Venus itself rotates at a leisurely 243-day pace.Despite the lure of mysterious Venus, NASA hasn\u2019t dispatched a dedicated probe since the radar-mapping       Magellan       mission ended more than two decades ago. The European orbiter Venus Express kept watch for eight years until 2014, revealing a surprisingly cold region and a tenuous layer of ozone high in the atmosphere. In December 2015, a refrigerator-sized Japanese spacecraft named Akatsuki\u2014meaning \u201cdawn\u201d\u2014survived a near-fatal engine failure to reach Venus\u2019s midst after a five-year delay.NASA had a chance to make amends to Venus earlier this year. Among five mission concepts vying for a slot on the space agency\u2019s Discovery program, two proposed a visit to Venus. One aimed to drop a probe that would sample the air, and the other proposed mapping Venus\u2019s surface at high resolution from orbit. But NASA announced in January that neither had made the cut.Given all that scientists expect to learn from Venus, the planet does not deserve to remain in its sibling\u2019s shadow.Mr. Jayawardhana, an astrophysicist and dean of science at York University in Toronto, is the author of \u201cStrange New Worlds\u201d (Princeton University Press, 2011).", "news_time": "2017-06-11 16:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venus-shines-in-the-shadow-of-mars-1497213413", "news_title": "Venus Shines in the Shadow of Mars", "keywords": " earth, exploration, global warming, greenhouse, mars, mission, nasa, probe, space,venus,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,sciences,humanities,space exploration,travel,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "The drama of American cities spiraling into crises of crime, poverty and urban decay\u2014accompanied by endless and mostly failed efforts to reverse such trends\u2014played out repeatedly during the second half of the 20th century. New York\u2019s collapse toward bankruptcy in the 1970s, Atlantic City\u2019s spectacle of casinos and mobs, the hollowing out of Detroit as the auto industry went into cardiac arrest\u2014these were just the most cinematic versions.In \u201cCity on the Verge: Atlanta and the Fight for America\u2019s Urban Future,\u201d Mark Pendergrast, a freelance journalist and Atlanta native, offers up a variation on that pattern\u2014the tale of a Southern city that experienced a dramatic crash even as it emerged as the commercial capital of a booming region. He chronicles Atlanta\u2019s ordeal of decline, its fitful recovery and, now, its embrace of one of the most ambitious urban-redevelopment projects under way in the United States.That project, called the BeltLine, is a plan to spend up to $5 billion over the next 20 years to convert a loop of old railway lines circumnavigating Atlanta into a 22-mile \u201cnecklace\u201d of walking paths, bicycle trails, light-rail transit and public parks. Completion of the BeltLine, Mr. Pendergrast writes, is \u201ca matter of life or death\u201d for Atlanta. The project, he says, is a kind of \u201cpetri dish\u201d for how other cities should approach their own challenges.The project is reminiscent of Manhattan\u2019s celebrated High Line Park, built on an abandoned 1.5-mile section of an elevated railway. But Atlanta\u2019s version is exponentially larger. Only a few miles have been completed, but those sections have already triggered a rush of new housing, upscale restaurants, farmers\u2019 markets and entertainment venues. Mr. Pendergrast makes the case that the BeltLine can be even more: a concrete messiah of sorts, able to unify 45 disparate neighborhoods; bridge Atlanta\u2019s historic divides between rich and poor and black and white; reduce homelessness, air pollution and traffic jams; heal poverty, public health and poor nutrition\u2014even revitalize public schools. This is a lot to ask of a bike path. Even a really nice one.By Mark Pendergrast  Basic, 327 pages, $30Ever since Atlanta\u2019s burning in the Civil War, grand plans, unchecked boosterism, destruction and rebirth have been integral to its civic personality. The city motto is \u201cResurgens\u201d\u2014Rising Again. Its modern challenges are rooted in the 1960s, when as an economic center Atlanta was eclipsing its rivals across the South but at the same time registering the first seismic tremors of the civil-rights movement. Black student sit-ins were forcing the desegregation of businesses. The African-American middle class was confronting apartheid-style residential restrictions.White residents, who constituted more than 60% of Atlanta\u2019s population and held political control, became hysterical. To preserve racial boundaries, Mayor       Ivan Allen       in 1962 authorized barricades across two streets, hoping to stop the encroachment by blacks into all-white areas. It didn\u2019t work, of course. Facing the prospect of African-American neighbors and mixed-race classrooms, more than 160,000 whites fled over two decades. Almost 100,000 black residents moved in\u2014many of them displaced agricultural workers from impoverished rural areas.Atlanta\u2019s downtown business district\u2014once the most prestigious commercial address in the Southeast\u2014all but died. Poverty skyrocketed. Atlanta public schools lost half their enrollment. Murders quadrupled between 1960 and 1970. African-Americans suddenly became the political majority, and in 1973 Atlanta\u2019s first black mayor inherited a city that by many measures had already cratered. Through the succeeding decades, with many stops and starts, Atlanta\u2019s inner core climbed back from the precipice, and the city built the world\u2019s busiest airport, hosted the 1996 Olympic Games, hit the reset button on troubled schools and attracted new life to abandoned neighborhoods. It remains an unfinished work, however.\u201cCity on the Verge\u201d is a deeply researched effort to capture this history and, along the way, paint a portrait of Atlanta\u2019s neighborhoods, from the still elite area where the author spent his childhood to bustling zones of gentrification and immovable pockets of desperation. As for the BeltLine project, Mr. Pendergrast documents its genesis in a paper by a graduate student in 1999 and its gradual acceptance by civic leaders. He also conveys the contentious debates that surrounded its funding and anxieties over which areas or political constituencies would benefit most.Unfortunately, \u201cCity on the Verge\u201d eventually sags under the weight of its detail. The name of every player of even fleeting consequence is unnecessary. The enumeration of every street passed on the way to an interview is too much. More important, the deluge of information can obscure significant questions. Almost every American city, for instance, faces the paradox that \u201csuccess\u201d in attracting middle-class families to blighted neighborhoods almost inevitably means displacing poor people. A book like this also cannot lament on one page that segregation once denied African-Americans the benefits of buying homes in areas where property values might rise and, on another, lament that current \u201cgentrification\u201d is bringing higher real-estate prices to black neighborhoods. Complicated collisions of urban ambition such as those demand a more rigorous accounting.More broadly, \u201cCity on the Verge\u201d accepts a shaky proposition: that one great shining idea can transform a major urban center. Like most major American cities, Atlanta has experienced dramatic changes in recent years. Young new residents have poured in, reflecting a broad national shift in taste away from suburbia, and market forces have responded. The success of the BeltLine so far is the product of powerful cultural and economic trends, not the cause of them. If, for whatever reason, that great shining idea is never fully realized, Atlanta will surely find another one.Mr. Blackmon, formerly the Journal\u2019s Atlanta bureau chief, is a senior fellow at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center and the host of \u201cAmerican Forum,\u201d a weekly current-affairs program on most PBS stations.", "news_time": "2017-06-11 16:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/atlanta-rises-again-1497213306", "news_title": "Atlanta Rises Again", "keywords": "books,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,poverty,social issues,welfare,social services,reviews"}, {"content": "First it was Austria, then the Netherlands, France and now the U.K.: The outcome of last week\u2019s election in Britain should be seen as the latest installment of the anti-populist backlash that has been sweeping Europe this year. As in those other elections, voters turned against narrow nationalism.Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       misjudged gamble in calling a snap general election failed because liberal voters in many of the most dynamic parts of England turned against her hard-line Brexit agenda.She was only able to cling to power because of a similar backlash in Scotland, where tactical voting by opponents of the Scottish Nationalist Party\u2019s plans for a second independence referendum gifted Mrs. May\u2019s Conservatives 12 Scottish seats.Of course other factors were important. Mrs. May ran a dreadful campaign, her mirthless repetition of banal sound bites contrasting with the unexpected charisma of Labour\u2019s       Jeremy Corbyn.       Her manifesto also succeeded in alienating many of her target voters while Mr. Corbyn\u2019s extravagant promises to shower public money on popular causes appealed to voters tired of austerity.But what sealed Mrs. May\u2019s fate was an average 7% swing to Labour in constituencies that backed remaining in the European Union in last June\u2019s referendum by more than 55%. Thus was delivered to Labour previously unimaginable victories in areas such as the wealthy London neighborhood of Kensington and the university town of Canterbury. An expected landslide for Mrs. May turned into a net loss of 13 seats.What happens now to Brexit is anybody\u2019s guess.Although the Conservatives lack a parliamentary majority, Mrs. May has been able to stay in office thanks to the promise of support from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party. But it isn\u2019t clear whether this will be sufficient to deliver Brexit. Thanks to what now looks like a reckless decision to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty just days before calling the general election, the clock is now counting down on the two years allowed to negotiate an exit deal.Yet with negotiations due to begin next week, Mrs. May finds herself without a mandate for her Brexit plan, which would take the U.K. out of the EU\u2019s single market and customs union and end the right of EU citizens to live in the U.K. As a result, she may struggle to secure the parliamentary support to deliver the highly contentious legislation\u2014known as the Great Repeal Bill\u2014needed to put in place the legal and regulatory frameworks to ensure British businesses can trade post-Brexit.Even if Mrs. May no longer has a mandate to carry out her threat to crash out of the EU without an exit deal, there is still a risk that the U.K. ends up with a chaotic Brexit because it has been unable to negotiate a deal in what time remains or because it has been unable to put the necessary arrangements in place to cushion the impact. That has prompted some in the Conservative Party\u2014including Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davison who has emerged as a pivotal figure after the elections\u2014 to talk of the need to build a cross-party consensus around a softer form of Brexit. This could involve the U.K. remaining inside the EU\u2019s single market and customs union, perhaps as a member of the European Economic Area, a looser alliance that includes Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.Yet this EEA option would turn the U.K. from an EU rule-maker into a rule-taker, an unsatisfactory and likely unsustainable situation for an economy of the U.K.\u2019s significance. The U.K. would be effectively obliged to continue to allow the free movement of EU citizens, respect the judgments of the European Court of Justice and pay into the EU budget, crossing all Mrs. May\u2019s red lines. It would also require the consent of both the EU and other EEA countries, which can\u2019t be guaranteed.If this version of Brexit had been on the ballot, it would almost certainly have been rejected\u2014which is why it was rejected by the official Leave campaign. Yet it may now be the only version of Brexit that is deliverable in the time available. The best bet is that Brexit would go ahead, not least because both major parties committed to it in their manifestos. Still, it is possible for the first time since the referendum to imagine two scenarios in which Brexit doesn\u2019t happen.Under the first, the political turmoil in the Conservative Party\u2014caused by what appears to be an inevitable challenge to Mrs. May\u2019s leadership before the two years is up\u2014makes it impossible to negotiate a deal in the time available, prompting the U.K. to ask for a delay to the deadline. It is possible the EU might refuse under those circumstances, insisting instead that the U.K. withdraw its Article 50 notification. That would end the process until a new prime minister received a new mandate from Parliament and the voters to restart it.Under the second scenario, the Brexit process becomes so chaotic that the British political leaders conclude that the only way to hold the political parties together and secure the parliamentary support for the Great Repeal Bill is to agree to a second referendum on the terms of any Brexit deal. In today\u2019s political climate\u2014with the Tory Brexiters damaged, the economic consequences of Brexit becoming clearer as the U.K. economy slows and with the EU itself now debating wider reform\u2014it is just possible that a second vote would deliver a different result.Write to Simon Nixon at simon.nixon@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   An expected landslide for Mrs. May in last week\u2019s U.K. election turned into a net loss of 13 seats.

Since then, Treasury has been using extraordinary measures, such as redeeming certain investments in federal pensions programs and suspending new investments in those programs, to raise cash. At some point in the coming months, the Treasury will exhaust those measures and run too low on cash to make all of its payments in full and on time unless the debt limit is raised and it can once again sell bonds.Lack of clarity complicates the administration\u2019s efforts to convince\u00a0lawmakers to raise the debt limit sooner rather than later.\u201cCongress is going to need to know what the deadline is, because until they actually focus on a specific date, it\u2019s going to be hard to come up with a strategy to get the increase done,\u201d             Goldman Sachs                   political\u00a0economist Alec Phillips said.Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       urged lawmakers last month to deal with the debt ceiling before they leave for the summer on July 28, but stopped short of saying when the government will run out of cash. On Friday he told reporters \u201cwe will be fine\u201d if Congress doesn\u2019t raise the ceiling before August.\u201cThis is not an issue, but I don\u2019t want to leave any doubt we have plans, and backup plans, for funding the government,\u201d he said. Asked to elaborate, he said, \u201cThey are Treasury secretary super powers,\u201d a phrase he has used in the past to refer to the extraordinary measures.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s remarks Friday suggest Treasury doesn\u2019t see those measures running out before lawmakers return from their recess on Sept. 5. A Treasury spokesman didn\u2019t respond to a request seeking further clarification. The comments could be interpreted by Congress as a reason to delay action until then, despite Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s earlier\u00a0entreaties to act sooner.Lawmakers will likely try to pin him down this week when he testifies on Capitol Hill three separate times, starting Monday afternoon, on the president\u2019s budget.Typically, the Treasury secretary provides details about timing in a letter to Congress several months in advance of a potential debt-ceiling breach. In 2011, for example, Treasury Secretary       Tim Geithner       notified Congress on April 4 that Treasury expected to run out of room to meet obligations around July 8. In 2015, Secretary       Jacob Lew       told Congress on July 29 that extraordinary measures would last until the end of October or shortly thereafter.Mr. Mnuchin sent letters to lawmakers in March detailing the extraordinary measures Treasury had begun using, but didn\u2019t say when he expected to run out of room to pay the government\u2019s bills.The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank, is expected to release an updated analysis Monday showing Treasury will exhaust its extraordinary measures in October or November, unchanged from their earlier projections.One uncertainty surrounding forecasts is that government revenues have been lower in recent months than previously expected, possibly due to individuals and businesses delaying tax payments in anticipation of GOP tax cuts. If the trend continues, it could cause Treasury to run out of room sooner, analysts have said.The Congressional Budget Office said last week that federal government receipts fell short of expectations for the second month in a row.Although government receipts are up $29 billion during the first eight months of the fiscal year from the same period a year earlier, the CBO said they continue to be about $60 billion to $70 billion, or 3%, smaller than what CBO predicted at the beginning of 2017.The Treasury Department is expected to report similar results Monday.\u201cWe\u2019ll know a lot more in the first week of July when we get the next monthly update,\u201d said Wrightson ICAP chief economist Lou Crandall, who still sees extraordinary measures lasting until October.Adding to the confusion were comments from White House budget director       Mick Mulvaney,        who said last month the lower tax receipts could cause the government to run out of room to meet its obligations \u201ca couple weeks\u201d sooner than expected. Though Mr. Mnuchin has acknowledged\u00a0receipts are running low, he hasn\u2019t said Treasury\u2019s estimates of the deadline have changed.The two officials have also expressed different views on whether lawmakers should raise the ceiling with no conditions attached\u2014Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s preference\u2014or tie it to spending cuts or other legislative\u00a0changes, a strategy Mr. Mulvaney has pushed since he was a House lawmaker.The administration sought to dispel the confusion last week when President Donald Trump told GOP leaders Mr. Mnuchin is the point-person on the matter.GOP staffers have requested a point-forecast estimating when Treasury believes the government will hit its so-called \u201cx-date,\u201d according to a Senate aide.House Speaker       Paul Ryan       said Thursday it would be possible for the GOP to assemble a package of spending cuts to pair with a debt-ceiling increase before August to satisfy the party\u2019s more conservative members.\u201cCan we assemble a package before August? Sure. Do we have to before August? No, we don\u2019t have to,\u201d he said, adding that conversations about how to proceed are still ongoing.Meanwhile, House Minority Leader       Nancy Pelosi       said Friday she hoped lawmakers would pass a clean debt-limit increase by the end of July \u201cbecause this may come due in August.\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s September we want to be ready,\u201d she said.Investors see the risk of a debt-ceiling impasse rising, but are still fairly confident that Congress will raise the limit as it has several times in recent years, sometimes at the very last minute.There are still reasons to suggest this fight may be more complicated, including a lack of Senate-confirmed officials atop the Treasury Department. That means the bulk of the effort is falling on Mr. Mnuchin and his small band of counselors, none of whom has navigated a debt ceiling fight before.\u201cOur view remains that lawmakers will address the debt ceiling in advance of the deadline, but we caution that the path to a deal is murkier than previous iterations of the debt ceiling wars,\u201d       Isaac Boltansky,        an analyst with Compass Point Research and Trading, told clients in a note last week.Write to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Capitol Hill Lacks Clarity on Debt-Ceiling Timing.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 16:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/capitol-hill-lacks-clarity-on-debt-ceiling-date-1497193228", "news_title": "Capitol Hill Lacks Clarity on Debt-Ceiling Date ", "keywords": "congress,date,debt ceiling,debt limit,mnuchin,recess,treasury,Congressional Budget Office,Treasury,U.S. Treasury Department,Steven Mnuchin,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department"}, {"content": "Architecture and design firm CetraRuddy is planning to relocate its office to a lower Manhattan tower, joining the flow of firms that have diversified and revitalized the area over the last several years.CetraRuddy signed an 11-year lease to move its offices from the SoHo neighborhood to One Battery Park Plaza, which is across the street from Battery Park, according to the building\u2019s owners, a joint venture of the Rudin family and             Allianz Real Estate                   of America.\u201cYou are seeing the continued movement of architectural and design firms downtown,\u201d said Bill Rudin, chief executive of Rudin Management Co.Downtown Manhattan recently has been on an upswing, recording 2.3 million square feet of leasing in the first quarter this year and capturing five of the 10 largest Manhattan leases during the period, according to real estate services firm JLL.

His supporters consider him a freedom fighter and a former political prisoner, but his critics, including, New York Police Commissioner       James O\u2019Neill,        call him a terrorist.While Mr. L\u00f3pez Rivera wasn\u2019t officially honored at the 60th annual Puerto Rican Day Parade that made its way up Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, his attendance was widely noted. Parade marchers wore T-shirts decorated with his image and carried banners emblazoned with his name. One read in Spanish, \u201cIf it\u2019s Oscar, it has to be good.\u201dLuis Edgardo Martinez,        56 years old, said he was okay with Mr. L\u00f3pez Rivera marching in the parade, but said he should have shown remorse for his actions. \u201cHe never apologized to anyone,\u201d said Mr. Martinez, who lives in Boston. \u201cHe put people\u2019s lives in danger.\u201dJose Cruz,        60, said he considers Mr. L\u00f3pez Rivera to be a freedom fighter, adding that his presence in the parade \u201cgives us something to feel good about.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s my hero,\u201d said Mr. Cruz, who lives in Manhattan.Mr. L\u00f3pez Rivera has never been charged with carrying out violent acts, but the FALN claimed responsibility for dozens of bombings in New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C., including one attack in a lower Manhattan restaurant, Fraunces Tavern, in 1975 that killed four people and injured dozens.Former President       Barack Obama       earlier this year commuted Mr. L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2019s 55-year prison sentence after he had served 36 years.In May, parade officials said they would honor Mr. L\u00f3pez Rivera at the annual celebration. Soon after, several corporate sponsors pulled out and officials, including Mr. O\u2019Neill, Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       and Brooklyn District Attorney       Eric Gonzalez,        said they wouldn\u2019t attend.The New York Hispanic Society boycotted the parade, citing the police officers injured in FALN attacks, as did the New York Dominican Officers Organization and the Nassau County Police Hispanic Society.Later, Mr. L\u00f3pez Rivera said others should be honored in his place.Council Speaker       Melissa Mark-Viverito,        who has been among Mr. L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2019s biggest supporters, marched in the parade, as did along with Mayor       Bill de Blasio.The mayor who at first said he would march in the parade if Mr. L\u00f3pez Rivera was honored, changed his position last week when he told parade organizers he would skip the event if the former militant was honored.\u201cI think it\u2019s great\u201d that there were fewer politicians and corporate sponsors this year, said       Raphael Dobles,        19, from Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s the first parade that really feels like our own.\u201dNew York Police Department officials also said they had a robust law-enforcement presence on hand for the parade, but didn\u2019t receive any threats related to Mr. L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2019s participation.There was \u201cno increased security based on the controversy itself, but like every other major parade we\u2019ve had in the past year, we\u2019ve increased security,\u201d Chief       Terry Monahan       said.The parade was held during a critical juncture for the future of the island, as Puerto Ricans headed to the polls on Sunday to vote in a referendum on statehood.

The report couldn\u2019t be independently confirmed.Qatar\u2019s only land border is with Saudi Arabia, and it had relied on its larger neighbor for a significant portion of its food, raising concerns of a shortage. Residents initially emptied supermarket shelves of canned goods and other items after the rupture, but calm was restored after Qatari authorities pointed to the country\u2019s large food reserves and ability to import essentials from elsewhere.The four Arab countries that cut ties accused Qatar of meddling in their affairs and harboring terrorists, touching off the Persian Gulf region\u2019s biggest political crisis in years. They see entities that Qatar hosts and supports, including Islamist movements Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, as terrorist groups.\u201cThe Qatari government has been making deals and looking in the other direction for years, and one is responsible for decisions you make and for the commitments you give, and we\u2019re calling them out on that right now,\u201d said Reem al-Hashimi, the U.A.E.\u2019s minister of state for international cooperation.Qatari officials have rejected the four countries\u2019 accusations, saying they don\u2019t consider Islamist groups terrorists, and that the country has hosted them to act as a mediator.The split could present a rare opportunity for Iran, the region\u2019s main Shiite Muslim power, to drive a wedge between its usually tightly allied Sunni adversaries on the other side of the Persian Gulf, analysts said. Iran and the Gulf states are on opposing sides in a number of regional battlefields, including in Yemen and Syria.Qatar is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, along with Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman. Most of the GCC countries oppose Iran\u2019s regional aims, including its support for Shiite militia Hezbollah in Lebanon and its backing of Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad       against a long-running challenge by Sunni rebels.Qatar has supported Syrian rebel groups, but it has been more open than many Gulf neighbors to interaction with Iran, which those neighbors see as their main rival for power and influence. Qatar, which has some of the world\u2019s largest gas reserves, shares the gigantic South Pars gas field with Iran.\u201cI think Iran views this as a huge opportunity, despite Qatari support for rebels in Syria,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, the chairman of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. \u201cIran has chance to pick off, with Turkey, a GCC member. It doesn\u2019t get much better.\u201dTurkey is a close Qatari ally and supports some regional Islamist movements that Qatar has hosted, such as the Muslim Brotherhood. Turkish President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       has said Turkey would provide Qatar with food and medicine to address isolation caused by the diplomatic break. Turkey\u2019s parliament also recently approved the deployment of troops to a Turkish base in Qatar.The Trump administration, meanwhile, has sent mixed signals on the crisis. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       urged the four countries to cease their economic siege on Qatar, while President Donald Trump lashed out at Qatar on Twitter for allegedly supporting terror groups.The Iranian shipments of food went to Qatar from Tehran and the southern city of Shiraz aboard             Boeing                   747s, the Iran Air spokesman was quoted as saying, and the airline was ready to increase the volume of deliveries.About 100 tons of the food were going every day from Shiraz, the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency quoted agricultural official Ali Hemmati as saying Sunday. Another official said Iran\u2019s southern Fars province could send 45 tons of dairy products daily to Qatar, according to Iranian media.In another supportive move, Iran has opened its airspace for Qatari flights that used to use Saudi, Emirati and Bahraini airspace.

The Wall Street Journal couldn\u2019t independently verify Veja\u2019s report.Supreme Court Chief Justice C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia Rocha responded in a statement Saturday, saying that, if proved correct, the allegations would constitute a serious crime. She said the practice of spying on judges was \u201ctypical of dictatorships\u2026and absolutely unacceptable in a democratic republic.\u201dThe allegations came only hours after Mr. Temer was acquitted Friday on separate illegal campaign-finance charges in a trial that could have ousted him, and they sparked further calls from opposition politicians Sunday for him to step down.\u201cOut with Temer!\u201d wrote Senator Randolfe Rodrigues Sunday on Twitter from the opposition Rede party. \u201cIf people don\u2019t go to the streets to protest, he will continue as president\u2026the people have to protest!\u201d said Mr. Rodrigues in a video posted earlier on social media.Even as Mr. Temer\u2019s approval ratings have fallen to single digits in recent months, street protests against him have remained small as crisis-weary Brazilians fear causing further turmoil, especially as the country begins to emerge from recession.Mr. Temer has been battling to cling to power since executives from meatpacker JBS last month accused the president of taking bribes as part of the Car Wash matter, an alleged multi-billion-dollar bribery and kickback racket involving some of Brazil\u2019s largest companies. He has denied the accusations.Opposition politicians had hoped Brazil\u2019s top electoral court would vote to oust him this week over the separate case involving campaign funds for the 2014 elections. However, the court on Friday absolved him, citing the importance of maintaining stability in the country.Mr. Temer still faces the Supreme Court investigation and several impeachment requests by lawmakers, but both require the support of Congress to proceed. While unpopular among voters, Mr. Temer is considered a deft back-room negotiator.If street protests remain small, observers say his allies would have little reason to turn against him, lending him the support he needs to stay in power until presidential elections in 2018.Write to Samantha Pearson at samantha.pearson@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Brazilian Judge Notes Spy Report.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 15:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-brazilian-judge-cites-potentially-grave-crime-by-countrys-president-1497208629", "news_title": "Top Brazilian Judge Cites Potentially \u2018Grave Crime\u2019 by Country\u2019s President ", "keywords": "brazil,brazilian bribery case,brazilian corruption probe,brazilian politics,car wash corruption investigation,corruption,south american corruption ,Brazilian Intelligence Agency,Michel Temer,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,espionage,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "Wednesday will be busy in the U.S., with data on consumer prices and retail sales due, followed later in the day by a Federal Reserve monetary-policy decision. The Bank of England also meets to set policy this week, just days after the U.K. election caused new political turmoil.WEDNESDAY: Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect U.S. retail sales increased 0.1% in May from the prior month. The April report from the U.S. Commerce Department showed a 0.4% gain in consumer spending despite weak earnings at large brick-and-mortar retailers, as households boosted their spending in other areas.The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s consumer-price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in April from the prior month, but the annual increase slowed for the second straight month, to 2.2%. The lower trajectory for inflation has raised concerns for the Fed as it weighs further interest-rate increases this year. Economists surveyed by WSJ forecast CPI was unchanged in May from the prior month.May industrial production figures from China (release time is Tuesday evening in the U.S.) are forecast to show growth of 6.4% year on year. This compares with April\u2019s 6.5% expansion, which would signal that the world\u2019s second-largest economy is slowly losing steam. Still, economists expect fixed-asset investment, a gauge of construction activity that will be released at the same time, to show a rise of 9% on year for the January-May period\u2014compared with an 8.9% annual increase over the first four months of the year.Economists almost unanimously expect the Fed\u2019s interest-rate-setting committee to announce an increase in short-term interest rates, but they are split over when it will raise rates after that. Fed officials must weigh mixed economic signals, such as a strengthening labor market coupled with softening inflation.

Of the 20 Republicans who voted against the House bill, 16 represent states that saw significant increases in drug-overdose death rates in recent years.Two of those lawmakers hail from Ohio, which, through the state\u2019s ACA expansion, has enrolled more than 500,000 new Medicaid recipients who have behavioral-health needs, including\u00a0those with\u00a0drug addiction and different mental-health disorders.Now, the same concerns are emerging as a factor as the Senate takes up the House bill and ponders how to change it.Ohio Sen. Rob Portman said in an interview that there is a growing worry among fellow GOP senators that rolling back the Medicaid expansion without offering other affordable options would have an outsize effect on people seeking addiction treatment, who access medications and other treatments through their insurance.\u201cSo many people on Medicaid and expanded Medicaid rely on that funding for their treatment for substance abuse,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is clearly an issue where you don\u2019t want to make matters worse by reducing access to treatment.\u201dMr. Portman, along with other Republican senators from states that have expanded Medicaid such as Dean Heller of Nevada, are pushing to wind down the Medicaid expansion funding more slowly. They would have the rollback occur over a seven-year window beginning in 2020.Lawmakers are also looking at including a pot of money specifically\u00a0for\u00a0opioid\u00a0treatment, according to Republican senate aides.But more budget-hawkish lawmakers, led by Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, want to end the Medicaid expansion\u00a0in three years, by 2023. Both sides have dug in, aides say, making the prospect of an overall deal less likely.Years of loose prescription of addictive opiate painkillers, as well as a prolific supply of\u00a0opiates\u00a0from Mexico and China, fueled a surge in overdose deaths over the past two decades. They ballooned from about 8,000 in 1999 to more than 30,000 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a number comparable to those who died from car crashes in the U.S. that same year. Recent data suggest the pace of deaths has only quickened.While he was running for president,       Donald Trump       often referred to the crisis at appearances in New Hampshire, Ohio and Michigan, three swing states experiencing some of the highest overdose-death rates.\u201cWe will work hard to get all of those people that are hooked\u2014we\u2019ll get them off it. One way or another,\u201d he said during an August campaign stop.Ohio, with its double-digit percentage increases in\u00a0opioid-related deaths in 2014 and 2015, has slowly become the symbol of the\u00a0opioid\u00a0epidemic. The state\u2019s attorney general recently filed lawsuits against five drug companies, claiming each misrepresented the addictive risks of their painkillers.Over the past couple years, increasing federal funding to treat\u00a0opioid\u00a0addiction has become a rare bipartisan mission, with Republicans and Democrats authorizing more than $1 billion in new grant spending through the 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law in December.But Democrats now accuse the GOP of breaking that fragile bipartisan consensus through their ACA repeal efforts.Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat on the Senate Finance committee, which oversees much of health legislation, said her party believes the government should ensure that anyone with a need for addiction treatment gets it, either through open-ended Medicaid funding or a requirement that their private insurance offer it as a benefit.\u201cWhen someone has heart disease and needs open heart surgery, we don\u2019t say to them, \u2018Gee I\u2019m sorry, the grant funding ran out,\u2019 \u201d she said.Two Republicans are offering an alternative approach. In their own ACA repeal bill, Sens.       Susan Collins       of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana would allow states to decide whether to maintain or jettison ACA requirements and subsidies. But it would keep one benefit mandatory: coverage for mental-health and addiction treatment.\u201cThat seemed like the fiscally sound, conservative way to go\u2014because we\u2019ve got to pay for this somehow,\u201d Mr. Cassidy said in an interview.\u2014Michelle Hackman contributed to this article.Write to Sharon Nunn at sharon.nunn@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Opioid Crisis Poses Challenge for Bill.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 14:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/opioid-crisis-complicates-gops-health-law-push-1497207541", "news_title": "Opioid Crisis Complicates GOP\u2019s Health-Law Push", "keywords": "behavioral addictions,obsessions,political,general news,society,community,health,medical conditions,mental disorders,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,welfare,social services,pharmaceuticals,analgesics,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,specialized drugs,medications,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"}, {"content": "For decades, economics textbooks argued that suddenly weaker currencies are a boon to growth, because they make a country\u2019s exports more competitive or profitable on the global stage, which in turn boosts domestic production and employment.What if that theory no longer holds?Economists and government officials are increasingly wondering if that effect is diminishing, especially among advanced Western economies with shrinking manufacturing capacity and supply chains increasingly interwoven with the rest of the world. The new idea is that much of the benefit from a falling currency is offset by the higher prices paid for components imported from overseas.The U.K. is emerging as a test case for whether globalization has diminished the effect. Although its currency has been battered by the financial crisis, the Brexit vote to leave the European Union\u2014which took place a year ago June 23\u2014and the country\u2019s fresh bout of political uncertainty, its exporting power hasn\u2019t responded as textbooks might suggest.Chemicals made at Chemoxy International Ltd.\u2019s factory in Middlesbrough are worth about 20% more in the export market after last June\u2019s fall in sterling, given the beefed-up value of the currencies used to buy those goods overseas. Higher costs for imported materials, however, all but erased that advantage.\u201cWe have a huge interdependency on international markets,\u201d says Chemoxy Chief Executive       Ian Stark.       The company exports more than 60% of its products and imports about 85% of its chemical raw materials. A weaker\u00a0pound, he says, \u201cisn\u2019t revolutionary.\u201dBritish businesses ranging from car makers to food processors to lumber mills are discovering the same thing.Adam Posen,        president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and a member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee between 2009 and 2012, says the effects of currency moves on exports have faded over time. After the financial crisis in 2008, a big sterling depreciation didn\u2019t result in the pickup in exports \u201cwe would have expected,\u201d he says.\u201cYou just don\u2019t get as much bang for your pound as you used to,\u201d said Mr. Posen.Whether or how the relationship between a currency\u2019s strength and economic growth still holds has ramifications for international politics. In the U.S., manufacturers have long complained about the impact of a strong dollar. President       Donald Trump       has accused Japan and China of keeping their currencies artificially low, hampering U.S. exports.In 1992, the pound fell by around 11% between September and the end of that year after the U.K. crashed out of the European exchange rate mechanism\u2014a precursor to the euro that required a stronger pound than the government could sustain. The U.K. economy then went on an export tear, which turned a trade deficit into a five-year surplus and jump-started a recovery.The\u00a0pound\u00a0fell by nearly 25% against the currencies of its major trading partners between 2007 and 2010 and never recovered, sparking optimism in government that exports would rise. In 2012, then-U.K. Treasury chief       George Osborne       targeted an increase in exports to \u00a31 trillion by 2020, from \u00a3499 billion that year. By the end of 2016, exports had risen to just \u00a3547 billion.When the currency took another beating after the Brexit vote, the impact was similarly muted. Car maker Aston Martin, which exports 80% of its vehicles, helps show why. Before Brexit, when the pound traded at $1.50, sports cars sold in New York for $150,000 would bring home \u00a3100,000. With the pound now at $1.27, such sales bring an extra \u00a318,000. But over half the car\u2019s components must be bought from abroad, blunting the effect.\u201cDuring the past decade, a lot of auto suppliers have moved offshore,\u201d says Aston Martin Chief Executive       Andy Palmer.       \u201cIn consequence, you don\u2019t get the benefits.\u201dIn recent months, sterling has recovered from its post Brexit lows and is currently down 15% against the dollar and 13% against the euro. Analysts remain pessimistic about the currency as Britain heads for divorce from its largest trading partner, the European Union. The pound fell 1.7% on Friday after Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       ruling Conservative Party failed to secure enough seats in a snap general election to alone form a government.Global economists are debating how much exchange rates affect trade for developed nations. Two recent papers, from the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, found movements in exchange rates had a declining impact on trade in several advanced economies.The OECD paper said a plunge of sterling in 2008 and the yen\u2019s decline against the dollar in 2012 had little impact on trade. The study said evidence suggested companies had become more embedded in global supply chains. Between 1995 and 2011, the import content of exports rose from 14.9% to 24.3% among OECD nations.In\u00a0May, the Bank for International Settlements published new mathematical models\u00a0for estimating\u00a0real effective exchange rates, one measure of the strength of a currency. It said without taking into account deep global supply chains, standard exchange-rate models \u201care increasingly becoming obsolete.\u201dOther economists have resisted the idea, including a team at the International Monetary Fund, which came to a different conclusion and found \u201clittle evidence of a weakening in the effects of exchange rates over time.\u201dIn its analysis, the IMF suggests a significant currency depreciation\u2014where currencies weaken by at least 13% in advanced economies, or 20% in emerging ones\u2014results in a 10% rise in export volumes over five years.The IMF had some caveats. The paper argues the impact of a weaker currency is strongest when the economy isn\u2019t running at full capacity, for example following a recession. It also suggests that financial crises dent companies\u2019 ability to take advantage of a depreciation, because of the lack of available credit.\u201cIn general, however\u201d the authors conclude, \u201cthe role of flexible exchange rates in facilitating the resolution of trade imbalances remains significant.\u201dSince Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, consumers abroad have been buying more British products. In the six months through April, the most recent month for which the U.K.\u2019s Office for National Statistics has published data, goods export volumes increased 3.1% from the year-earlier period. Over that same period, import volumes rose even more, by 4.9%.\u201cWe are not yet seeing a notable narrowing of the [trade] deficit,\u201d the Office for National Statistics noted in its latest report.For some exporters such as Scotland\u2019s whisky industry, the pound\u2019s fall has been pure good news because most of what goes into a bottle of whisky is produced locally. The Scotch Whisky Association says exports increased 4% last year to over \u00a34 billion.Most U.K. manufacturing industries, however, can no longer rely on domestic supply chains. In 2015, manufacturing represented 9.8% of the U.K.\u2019s gross domestic product, down from 14.7% in 2000. In the U.S., by comparison, manufacturing represented 12.3% of the GDP in 2015, and 15.5% in 2000.As U.K. manufacturing declined, service industries grew and now are responsible for 79% of GDP. Those industries are less sensitive to changes in exchange rates. In the services sector, the U.K. runs a trade surplus that grew to 5.4% of GDP at the end of last year. For London\u2019s huge financial sector, sterling\u2019s tumble has little benefit because business is often denominated in other currencies and demand for service industries tends to be less price sensitive.Trade in goods, however, is an entirely different story. The U.K. deficit in that area has ballooned from 1.6% of GDP in 1995\u00a0to 6.4% last year. It has kept rising despite imports becoming more expensive and exports more competitive. This year\u2019s goods deficit, through April, is \u00a342.8 billion, excluding oil and particularly volatile items such as aircraft.Some economists have long been sceptical of the idea that trade can be shifted by currency depreciation in the longer term. As a currency weakens, the price of imported goods rises, raising inflation. Also, they say, structural problems, such as weak productivity and competitiveness, are often causes of trade deficits, which depreciation cannot address and may even prevent a country from tackling.\u201cDon\u2019t believe that Britain is going to depreciate itself out of its current account imbalances,\u201d says       Willem Buiter,        chief economist at             Citigroup Inc.       and a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting committee.To make matters worse, Britain, like other developed economies, has become so reliant on imports to stock its stores that a weaker pound has increased inflation, making life more expensive and curbing consumer spending.Britain now imports more than 60% of its fish. The\u00a0pound\u2019s fall triggered a 15% overnight jump in prices for the crates of cod and haddock that       Mike Woods       buys from the docks of Grimsby, in northern England. That cost his food processing company, Albert Darnell Ltd., an additional \u00a315,000 a week.Like other food manufacturers, Mr. Woods is passing on that increased cost to consumers. Fish and chips have become more expensive at the St. James Fish Restaurant in the center of Grimsby. \u201cWe get people complaining now,\u201d says waitress       Eve Barrow.Retail prices of cars, shoes and potato chips all have risen. Last October, an increase in the price of Marmite, a sticky yeast spread beloved by the British, triggered front-page headlines. Economic growth in the U.K. slowed in the first quarter of the year, with higher prices hurting consumer spending.While more expensive imports should present opportunities for British manufacturers and suppliers to step in, it will take time for industry to adjust.Around 80% of the timber used in U.K. construction is imported, mainly from Scandinavia, according to the Timber Trade Federation. It isn\u2019t easy for Britain\u2019s construction industry, which is responsible for around 7% of GDP, to shift quickly to domestic suppliers.Keith Ainslie       of James Jones & Sons Ltd, the U.K.\u2019s largest sawmill, says the company\u2019s main plant in Lockerbie, Scotland, is already \u201cworking full tilt.\u201d Processing more logs would mean building another sawmill, a roughly \u00a360 million project that would take around three years to get up and running.Nature also acts as a limit. \u201cWe\u2019re constrained by the availability of trees,\u201d says Mr. Ainslie. It takes 40 to 55 years to grow a crop of trees to maturity.Still, some companies see the\u00a0pound\u2019s fall as an opportunity to expand.       Mark Driver       is setting up Rathfinny Wine Estate on England\u2019s southeastern coast. The price of equipment he needs to import, such as wine presses and bottling machinery, has increased since Brexit.Nevertheless, the former hedge-fund manager thinks the pound\u2019s decline is good news. By 2025, he says, he aims to be producing around one million bottles of sparkling wine a year and sending half of that overseas.A \u201cweaker\u00a0pound\u00a0helps us,\u201d he says. \u201cLong term, I think it\u2019s really positive.\u201dAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Currency Declines Lose Export Punch.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 14:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-currencies-fall-export-growth-is-supposed-to-followuntil-now-1497207236", "news_title": "When Currencies Fall, Export Growth Is Supposed to Follow\u2014Until Now", "keywords": "brexit,british economy,british pound,british sterling,competitive devalutions,currency devaluations,currency wars,do currencies help exports?,exchange rate,import substitution,theresa may,u.k. economy,Aston Martin,James Jones & Sons,Albert Darnell,Chemoxy International,Ian Stark,Andy Palmer,marketing,markets,corporate,industry exports,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,society,community,globalization,global,world issues"}, {"content": "ParisIsn\u2019t this the perfect, pretty ending that tennis so wanted? Isn\u2019t this presumably why anybody watched? I mean, except for Stan Wawrinka\u2014though Stan had a really sublime view.There he was, once again: Rafael Nadal, flat on his back in Paris, caked in red clay, triumphant again at the French Open, for an astonishing 10th time.It\u2019s ridiculous, no? A Nadal victory at the French is as familiar and seemingly assured as anything in sports, even misery and a high draft pick for the Cleveland Browns. The 31-year-old from Spain and this precious ivy-covered clay-court major tournament are intertwined like no other athlete and event. It\u2019s become a beautiful romance in a city that owns a patent on them.And yet this one was more fragile than it looked. Just a year ago, Nadal had barely been able to bring himself to watch the French Open finale on TV. He\u2019d abandoned the 2016 tournament with a wrist injury he feared could be career-altering, glumly departing for the Spanish coast and his slick yacht called Beethoven, along with his girlfriend, Xisca Perello, and a worrisome blue cast over his left forearm.\u201cI was trying to forget a little bit about tennis,\u201d Nadal admitted the other day.Nadal had stared down crises like this before\u2014his physical, swashbuckling style of play had proven to be punishing to his body, and yet he\u2019d somehow clawed back. In 2013, he\u2019d returned from a long layoff to win both the French and U.S. Open, a revival he called the highlight of his career.But Nadal had now crossed into his 30s. Tennis, full of fearless new competition, would not wait. Nadal managed to return for the Summer Olympics in Rio and the U.S. Open, but the wrist was still a problem, and he was not himself. When Nadal hosted his rival       Roger Federer       at a benefit for Nadal\u2019s academy in Mallorca, the two were too banged up to play even a casual friendly, what pros call a hit & giggle.If they couldn\u2019t hit, how could they giggle? Aging is undefeated. It gets everyone, even legends.Now it is one year later, and the clock has been spun in reverse. A brilliant tennis geezer renaissance is at hand. In January, Federer prevailed over Nadal in five sets to win his first major in almost a half decade. And Sunday here on Court Philippe-Chatrier at Stade Roland Garros, Nadal won his historic 10th in spectacular fashion, routing Switzerland\u2019s Wawrinka in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3, 6-1.It is both surprising and it is not. It is not surprising because Nadal has been playing glorious tennis in 2017, especially on clay. But it is a stunner when you consider the sad man on the shiny boat a year ago, fretting over a wrist he said was \u201calmost destroyed.\u201d\u201cLast year was a really hard one for me,\u201d Nadal said.From that, to this\u2014a victorious Nadal, back on his butt in the brick-colored limestone. La Decima, Spain is calling this title, a nod to soccer\u2019s Real Madrid. You can call it anything. It\u2019s as dominant a grip as sports has ever seen.The numbers are cuckoo. Nadal has entered here 13 times, winning 10, losing twice, and then the withdrawal last year. He\u2019s 79-2 all time in this tournament, his two defeats a solid bar bet (Robin Soderling 2009, Novak Djokovic 2015). He did not surrender a set in this year\u2019s championship, and if you want to go crazy, he lost only 35 games\u201435 games!\u2014in seven matches. His 10 titles are from the most any singles player has collected from one major in tennis\u2019s Open era, and there\u2019s also this: Nadal now has 15 major tournament victories altogether\u2014second only to Federer\u2019s recently-added-upon 18.They\u2019ve put the band back together, Rafa and Roger. Who saw that coming?But let\u2019s stick to Rafa, because this was his day, and this is his tournament\u2014Federer passed on Roland Garros altogether, preferring to rest up for Wimbledon. This is the part of the story where I\u2019m supposed to tell you that age and injury have created a different Nadal, a less grinding and physical version who does not play with the aggressiveness of his muscle-shirted, Capri-panted youth.Ha! This isn\u2019t the case. Nadal is still a terrifying saw blade. Ask Wawrinka, a 30-something handful himself, a French winner in 2015 who closed out world No. 1 Andy Murray in Friday\u2019s semifinals. Wawrinka has some of tennis\u2019 beastliest strokes, and yet Nadal punished him from the start. Maybe Wawrinka had some fatigue from five sets from Murray, maybe not\u2014either way, Sunday was less a match than it was smothering. Nadal\u2019s long, lasso-like forehand was great, and his two-handed backhand was even better, the spin on each putting Wawrinka in the corners on the run, unable to turn on offense.Late in the second set, as doom approached, a frustrated Wawrinka cracked a racket across his leg. It was petulant, but understandable. Stan saw what we all saw: Nadal is back to being Nadal, and nothing less.\u201cYou were too good,\u201d a Wawrinka said to Nadal at the trophy presentation.In total, the final lasted 2 hours and 5 minutes. Two-oh-five! In men\u2019s Grand Slam tennis, that\u2019s barely an appetizer.Even before he got his mitts on the trophy, Nadal was asked to contextualize his victory, to declare if his 10th French title was the sweetest, better than his first as a teenager in 2005, or the third, or the sixth, or the eighth, or the whatever. He wasn\u2019t ready. He would cop to this: to Nadal, Roland Garros was special, singular, unto itself. \u201cThe most important event in my career, without a doubt,\u201d he said, underlining the obvious.Then they gave him the trophy, and he held it aloft, and he did that thing where he bites the wing of the trophy for the photographers. He took the stadium microphone and praised Wawrinka, as well as the tournament organizers, his coach and uncle Toni, and finally the magical city that embraces him as one of their own.\u201cYou\u2019re going to always be in my heart,\u201d Rafael Nadal said.It was the kind of blushing line that Paris has heard a zillion times, and yet it sounded passionate and true.Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Rafael Nadal\u2019s Perfect Match.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 14:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rafael-nadal-and-the-french-opens-perfect-romance-1497206415", "news_title": "Rafael Nadal and the French Open\u2019s Perfect Romance", "keywords": "french open,grand slam tennis,nadal,rafael nadal,tennis,sports,recreation,commentaries,opinions,routine general news"}, {"content": "On paper, it was just another factory demolition job.But when engineers at German utility             E.ON                   took a look inside the W\u00fcrgassen plant, they knew they had a problem. Looming over them were 320 tons of radioactive steel covered by a lid that was way bigger than any of the factory\u2019s doorways. \u201cWe were stumped,\u201d said engineer       Andreas Ehlert.       \u201cIf we got it in somehow, there had to be a way out.\u201dThe only way to get it out would be to use a robot to slice it up like a cake, releasing radioactive particles and gases.No pressure!E.ON\u2019s nuclear unit is one of the leading players in the industry of nuclear power-plant demolition, which is undergoing a boom. As the atomic age hits retirement age, more than half of the roughly 450 nuclear power plants world-wide are nearing the end of their planned lives.Unfortunately, the people who built these plants didn\u2019t leave instruction manuals for taking them down. And even when they did remember to pass on useful information, odds are it was stored on outdated computer programs or written in Russian.That makes powering down, decontaminating and dismantling these plants extremely difficult\u2014and costly. Expunging a nuclear power plant can cost $1.5 billion, experts say. In Europe alone, the cleanup bill for around 90 shut plants will top $100 billion.Only 17 nuclear plants have ever been decommissioned and completely cleaned up. Roughly 160 more sit idle, awaiting demolition, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.When Mr. Ehlert and his team of 15 engineers at E.ON\u2019s PreussenElektra GmbH donned their hard hats and filed into the W\u00fcrgassen plant in Beverungen, what they saw sent their minds racing.Perched atop a nuclear reactor pressure vessel was a 74-ton lid 20 feet in diameter. To maneuver it into the elevator shaft and down to ground level, Mr. Ehlert and his team would have to smooth the edges of the corridor leading to the elevator. But even if that worked, they wouldn\u2019t be able to move the lid through the hallway to the decontamination rooms because the path was blocked by concrete pillars.It turns out when the facility was erected, workers installed the hulking pressure vessel and lid first and built the plant around them.The team ordered a high-powered jet that shoots sand-laden water with enough force to cut through steel, convinced regulators it could slice cleanly through the thickest part of the lid, and went to work.First the engineers enveloped the vessel lid with a suction tent to keep any dangerous waste from escaping. Using a remote-controlled robot arm that was attached to the jet, they began carving up the lid \u201clike a cheesecake,\u201d Mr. Ehlert said. After each cut, the arm had to be recalibrated manually and the sand swept and removed. Chopping it up took six weeks.Once outside, workers used a sandblaster to clean the metal that had sat just 30 feet from the radioactive reactor. \u201cYou could have made normal frying pans out of it,\u201d says Mr. Ehlert.In all, the project took a year, he says, and\u200bhelped to prompt the company to change its approach to dismantling. \u200b\u201cWe now have a look inside the pressure vessel first,\u201d spokeswoman       Almut Zyweck       said.VIEW InteractiveMuch of the work demolishing a nuclear power plant is little different from destroying, say, a sugar refinery, since radiation is limited to a small portion of the facility. But because nothing is very far from dangerous radiation, potential hazards can crop up almost anywhere.Workers cleaning up the Maine Yankee nuclear plant outside Portland, Me., once discovered contamination on the carpeting of the visitors\u2019 center. It was irradiated by a piece of uranium ore used in demonstrations, according to an official decommissioning report. How the carpet was exposed remains unclear.\u201cTechnically, it\u2019s very exciting to dismantle a plant,\u201d says       Thomas Volmar,        project manager at Germany\u2019s closed M\u00fclheim-K\u00e4rlich plant. \u201cMy engineer\u2019s heart beats faster.\u201dInside the M\u00fclheim-K\u00e4rlich reactor, workers are gradually stripping the plant down to naked walls for precise contamination readings and cleaning in a process that is equal parts high- and low-tech.Staff each day don\u00a0protective clothing, hard hats and radiation dosimeters for safety.\u00a0In cleared areas, the walls have become scratchpads, covered with freehand schematic drawings and phone numbers scrawled in black marker. Silver duct tape Xs cover nail holes to prevent radiation from seeping into the walls. Concrete blocks painted in yellow and black\u00a0stripes\u00a0flag hazards.When teams from Siempelkamp Engineering and Services GmbH were hired to help dismantle the massive Zion nuclear plant near Chicago, some engineers wanted to slice the gargantuan steel pressure vessels enveloping the cores using a torch with a powerful vacuum system to suck up dust and gases. The company had used the tool in Germany, but it had never been used in the U.S.Other staff from Siempelkamp, a family-owned company founded in 1883 to make textile presses, questioned the speed of the instrument. Engineers\u00a0wagered on how long the cuts and other milestones would take. \u201cA few greenbacks changed hands among colleagues,\u201d recalls Siempelkamp Managing Director Christian Jurianz. The tool worked.Problems occasionally arise when engineers discover that early blueprints weren\u2019t updated, says       Ralf Borchardt,        director of project management\u00a0at EWN Entsorgungswerk f\u00fcr Nuklearanlagen GmbH, a company created by Germany\u2019s government to dismantle Soviet-built plants in former East Germany.At Germany\u2019s Obrigheim reactor south of Frankfurt, he had to improvise a tool to remove a neutron-density monitor because old schematics were useless.Most reactors were built before personal computer technology. That means files are often stored on archaic media like first-generation floppy disks, and conversion is \u201cfraught with things that can go awry and suck up lots of time,\u201d says       Larry Boing,        decommissioning expert at Argonne National Laboratory outside Chicago. He recalls colleagues trying to access a technical drawing from an old computer system. \u201cNo one had the password anymore,\u201d he says.Language can pose another problem, particularly in parts of the former East Bloc that shook off Soviet hegemony but never translated documents. Unlike earlier generations, \u201cyounger engineers may not speak or read Russian,\u201d says Mr. Boing.Waste that is too radioactive for treatment gets sealed for safekeeping, and the containers redefine strength. They must last at least 50 years and be able to survive a drop-test from three stories up.

EU officials are wary whether the\u00a0Monday\u00a0meeting will bring much clarity beyond the U.K.\u2019s wish to open talks soon.A spokesman for the U.K. government said that \u201cwe have been clear that we want to make a start on negotiations and we continue to engage with official counterparts in the EU and Brussels ahead of the talks commencing.\u201dWith a weakened prime minister in London, whose leadership could soon be open to challengers from within her Conservative party, EU officials wonder how meaningful the\u00a0talks can be, even if they were to start as planned.\u201cUncertainty about how long she will stay in power and whether she can deliver on a compromise is the key question,\u201d said one senior EU official dealing with Brexit.A second official said that while the EU had \u201cno choice\u201d but to negotiate with London, it wasn\u2019t under any illusions about the possibility that the entire exercise might be \u201ca waste of time\u201d if there is a change in government.\u201cThe civil servants will have to do the work. But I personally do not see May\u2019s signature under the final Article 50 deal,\u201d said the second official, in reference to the EU treaty article spelling out the conditions for leaving the bloc.Mrs. May\u2019s negotiating position ahead of the election was that Brexit talks should focus both on the divorce and on the future relationship with the bloc, which she defined as a broad free-trade agreement with provisions for cooperation on security and other issues.But the EU\u2019s position is that talks can turn to the future relationship only after \u201csufficient progress\u201d on the divorce matters, an assessment that needs the approval of all 27 EU leaders.While the initial talks are likely to focus on issues where both sides want a deal, such as on the rights of EU citizens living in the U.K. and the rights of British citizens in the EU, there will be considerable reluctance to hammer out final compromises on contentious matters. Why settle, for instance, on how much money the U.K. still owes the bloc, when a new British government might agree on a higher sum?And it is the EU that has the upper hand on the timing of negotiations: Under EU rules, the U.K. must have a Brexit deal signed and ratified by March 2019 or face a disorderly exit unless the EU countries agree to extend the deadline.Dutch foreign minister Bert Koenders said\u00a0Friday\u00a0in The Hague that the British election \u201ccreated uncertainty and uncertainty is not good seeing as the clock is ticking.

The established Manhattan location ranks as the 15th\u00a0highest-grossing independent restaurant in the country, according to Restaurant Business, a trade publication.It is something of a bold move for the 66-year-old company, whose restaurants, including its flagship location in downtown Brooklyn, have been beloved by generations of New Yorkers and visitors alike. The company largely is known for cheesecakes and diner and deli-style fare that Mr. Rosen calls \u201cBrooklyn comfort food.\u201dTypically, restaurant companies try to spread themselves throughout a city, so as not to cannibalize an individual location\u2019s business. But Mr. Rosen says he was so drawn to his new location\u2014a high-traffic area near theaters, hotels and office buildings\u2014that he didn\u2019t worry about the proximity to the other Junior\u2019s.\u201cHow could you say no to 49th\u00a0and Broadway?\u201d asked Mr. Rosen of the 8,700-square-foot spot, which previously housed the pan-Asian restaurant Ruby Foo\u2019s.It cost $9 million to create the new Junior\u2019s, which is decorated in an orange-hued retro theme, Mr. Rosen said.His bet could pay off, said       Stephen Zagor,        dean of culinary business and industry studies at the Institute of Culinary Education. The city is so densely packed that a restaurant company need not be bound by conventional rules concerning spacing out locations, he explained. \u201cIn New York, there are lots of micro markets,\u201d he noted.Either way, the new Junior\u2019s is part of an ambitious expansion plan. Mr. Rosen says his company hopes to open one to three new locations annually and is looking beyond New York. Last October, the company opened a Junior\u2019s Restaurant in Boca Raton, Fla.The company is on track to increase its annual sales by about 40% to $100 million in 2017, according to Mr. Rosen. The business has grown beyond restaurants: Junior\u2019s sells its cheesecakes through retailers and direct to consumers via its website.Still, some things never change when it comes to Junior\u2019s.

Chief Executive       Travis Kalanick       will discuss taking a possible leave of absence when the board of directors of the embattled ride-hailing company meets Sunday morning, according to a person familiar with the matter.Also on the agenda when the seven-person board convenes is a vote on a series of recommendations from a report prepared by former U.S. Attorney General       Eric Holder       regarding its workplace.It was uncertain whether Mr. Kalanick would ultimately take the leave or whether the board would approve of such a measure, which would require finding a temporary replacement in short order.\u200bUber officials and Mr. Kalanick didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Kalanick has been weakened by a perception that his leadership fostered a work culture that tolerated sexual harassment and sexism, which prompted the Holder investigation.Uber Chief Business Officer Emil Michael, one of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s closest confidants, is planning to resign as soon as Monday, according to people familiar with matter.Mr. Michael helped oversee broad strategy initiatives including mergers and acquisitions and fundraising. He joined Uber in 2013 from Klout Inc., which rates users\u2019 online reputation, and had worked as an adviser to technology companies.Mr. Michael didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Uber is also grappling with other scandals: a lawsuit from Google parent Alphabet Inc. over allegedly stolen self-driving car trade secrets; a federal probe into its business operations; and the company\u2019s admission that it erroneously withheld tens of millions of dollars from New York City drivers over more than two years.But Mr. Kalanick is also facing a personal crisis. His mother died late last month in a boating accident that also left his father seriously injured. He has been spending time with his father in the Los Angeles area.\u200bThe board is due to meet in the Los Angeles area instead of in San Francisco, where Uber is based, because of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s family needs. Mr. Holder plans to attend the board meeting to elaborate on the findings of his law firm Covington & Burling LLP, which was given to a board subcommittee last week, this person said.News of the board meeting was reported earlier by tech news site Recode.Mr. Holder\u2019s report includes recommendations for new human-resource processes and trainings and details allegations by current and former employees about inappropriate behavior at Uber including sexual harassment, retaliation, bullying and other matters, people familiar with the matter said.Uber hired Mr. Holder to lead the investigation after a former software engineer,       Susan Fowler       Rigetti, claimed in a February blog post that Uber management had ignored multiple complaints from her and other female workers of sexual harassment and sexism by their managers.In her blog post, Ms. Fowler Rigetti claimed a supervisor propositioned her for sex and human-resources officials transferred her to another team instead of addressing her complaints. She said she was told she could either work for another group at the company or risk getting a poor performance review.Ms. Fowler Rigetti also claimed the company discouraged her from making complaints to human-resources officials. Managers changed her positive performance review to a poor one to deny her a promotion, she wrote.Mr. Kalanick, 40 years old, condemned the behavior, which he said he was unaware of, and immediately called for a probe of Uber\u2019s practices, hiring Mr. Holder\u2019s firm and Perkins Coie LLP to investigate the specifics of Ms. Fowler Rigetti\u2019s claims, among others.This week, Uber told employees that more than 20 workers had been fired as a result of the Perkins Coie probe and that others were reprimanded or ordered \u200bto undergo additional training.Since Uber\u2019s wave of setbacks and scandals began earlier this year, many executives have left the company. Uber has been trying to hire a deputy for Mr. Kalanick after a leaked video in February showed Mr. Kalanick berating an Uber driver. Uber is also seeking a CFO.If the board approves Mr. Kalanick\u2019s leave, it will mark a huge shift for the embattled CEO who developed a reputation for sharp elbows, a relentless work ethic and a willingness to push the limits of legality to achieve success. Chief of the ride-hailing firm since 2010, Mr. Kalanick has been the face of Uber amid its ascent to the world\u2019s most valuable private company, pegged by investors at $68 billion.The seven-member board includes private-equity billionaire       David Bonderman      ; media mogul       Arianna Huffington      ; venture capitalist       Bill Gurley       of Benchmark; an official from a Saudi Arabian government investment fund; co-founder Garrett Camp, who is chairman; early employee       Ryan Graves      ; and Mr. Kalanick himself.Uber has been conducting its own workplace investigation, including so-called listening sessions and focus groups led by human-resources chief       Liane Hornsey       and Ms. Huffington. Employees have also been summoned to the law firms\u2019 offices for interviews.The ride-hailing company had planned to release an executive summary for Mr. Holder\u2019s findings to employees and the media, though some investors have called for a full version of the report to be made public.It has taken other actions to shore up its image, including last week hiring two prominent women, Harvard Business School professor       Frances Frei       and Apple Music executive Bozoma Saint John.Uber lost $708 million in the first quarter, narrower than the nearly $1 billion lost in the fourth quarter, amid an 18% sales gain.

Investors should resist the temptation to ignore it.On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions will explore how the American drug-delivery system affects what patients pay for their medications. This will be one for investors to watch. Taking action on high medical costs is often discussed, and historically has come with minimal action. Health-care companies are, of course, major donors to politicians on both sides of the aisle. Tuesday\u2019s hearing won\u2019t even feature company executives or industry lobby groups.There is, however, plenty for the committee to dig into because the drug-delivery and reimbursement system is notoriously opaque. How certain industry practices affect total drug spending\u2014such as rebates paid by drugmakers to pharmacy-benefit managers\u2014is hotly disputed.Meanwhile, political conditions that have supported the status quo on drug pricing are starting to shift. The increased usage of high deductible insurance plans means that more patients with employer-based insurance are now directly affected by the price of prescription medications. About 35% of patients with employer insurance were on a high deductible plan in 2016, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers. That is up from 24% in 2011.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.Out of pocket expenses are naturally growing in line with that trend. Mylan\u2019s EpiPen, which was at the epicenter of last summer\u2019s drug-pricing uproar, provides a handy example. Average annual out of pocket spending on EpiPen for patients with commercial insurance was $75.50 in 2014, according to a recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, more than double the 2007 tally after adjusting for inflation. \u201cSimultaneously,\u201d the article\u2019s authors write, \u201cthe annual rate of EpiPen prescription fills barely increased, suggesting that the increased financial burden on patients was not due to higher usage.\u201dThe aggregate market value of U.S. health-care companies extends well into the trillions of dollars. Those riches have come under a drug-delivery system that is now under fresh scrutiny.Any substantive changes to drug pricing will take time to materialize. As long as patients are feeling more of the burden of high drug prices, though, dismissing the latest rumblings from lawmakers could prove to be an expensive mistake for investors.Write to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Don\u2019t Ignore Drug-Price Hearing.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 11:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/drug-prices-this-time-is-different-1497193200", "news_title": "Drug Prices: This Time Is Different", "keywords": "drug price hearings,drug prices,health care,health care costs,health insurance,heard on the street,pharmaceutical prices,marketing,markets,pricing,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commodity,financial market news,pharmaceuticals,medical equipment,supplies,life sciences,drug delivery technology"}, {"content": "Financial markets are in fairy-tale land. Surprises like the U.K. election, the victory of President       Donald Trump       and Brexit show a deep unease with economic conditions. Yet easy money, relatively steady global growth and low inflation have encouraged talk of \u201cGoldilocks.\u201d\u201cGoldilocks has not left us yet,\u201d was how             J.P. Morgan                   strategists summed it up recently. They aren\u2019t alone: analysts and economists at             Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,       ING and             Citigroup                   also have rolled out the markets\u2019 favorite fairy-tale character. Growth isn\u2019t too hot, not too cold, and performance has been buoyant. Global stocks are up, with the MSCI World index gaining nearly 10% this year. Low inflation means bonds are supported too. Credit markets are strong, and U.S. high-yield bonds have returned 5%. Emerging-market stocks, bonds and currencies have gained.The metaphor bears examining closely. As a reading of a globally coordinated upturn in growth, coupled with the large amount of liquidity from central banks, and minimal wage and inflation pressures, it might not be a stretch.But the political shocks of the past two years, particularly in the U.S. and U.K., suggest that outside financial markets, it is a different story. People are fed up with the status quo. One key component of the Goldilocks situation is the absence of a pickup in wage inflation, which means central banks can keep policy loose. But continued poor real-wage growth may also stoke more political turmoil at the ballot box. That increases the risk of electoral shocks that investors may not welcome.The U.K. is a case in point. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist,       Andy Haldane,        last year gave a speech asking who had benefited from the recovery, noting that despite data pointing to growth, half of all U.K. households had seen no expansion in real disposable incomes since 2005. The latest rise in U.K. inflation pushed real-wage growth back below zero just in time for voting. Central bankers around the world are puzzling over the apparent failure of wage formation to respond to falling unemployment, whether in the U.S., Germany, the U.K. or Japan. Yet their easy-money policies also have helped deliver extraordinary returns in financial markets.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.And those past returns may yet cause an issue with the part of the Goldilocks metaphor that doesn\u2019t get mentioned: the porridge. While nutritious, it is hardly particularly appetizing. And the starting point for financial markets is similar, because bond yields are ultralow, credit spreads are very tight and developed-market equities are far from cheap. Future return prospects are thus skinny, although emerging markets offer a brighter outlook. That helps explain why an apparently benign situation feels uncomfortable. Even as markets rise, there are few easy trades.Goldilocks might stick around for a while, but fairy tales don\u2019t have to have happy endings.Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'As Politics Boil Over, Financial Markets Are in Dreamland.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 10:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-politics-boil-financial-markets-are-in-dream-land-1497189616", "news_title": "As Politics Boil, Financial Markets Are in Dream Land", "keywords": " bonds, brexit,central banks, elections,fairy tale, gold, goldilocks,heard,heard on the street, inflation, markets, political risk, politics, stocks, trump, uk election,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,money,currency markets,money markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Warren A. Stephens asks \u201cWhy Do the Young Reject Capitalism?\u201d (op-ed, June 1) despite all of its virtues. But he provides no answer. Part of the answer is obvious. Anticapitalism is what they have been taught. All of the humanities and the noneconomic social sciences in universities have a simple message. Business is in the business of making money, not helping the poor or the environment. Once adopting this position, such teachers ignore all the evidence behind Adam Smith\u2019s \u201cinvisible hand,\u201d evidence cited in part by Mr. Stephens. Such evidence makes them uncomfortable because it is contrary to their already established views on the horrors of greed. College students absorb these lessons as evidenced by their becoming more liberal the longer they have been in college.Em. Prof. Phillip NelsonBinghamton UniversityOwego, N.Y.Why shouldn\u2019t they reject capitalism? They have been on the dole since they were born, their helicopter parents have done most things for them, they are the generation of \u201ceveryone gets a trophy\u201d and when they finally get to college they are fed the socialist propaganda that most colleges seem to value more than truth itself. Why extend yourself and work hard for what you want when it is so much easier to rely on your fellow citizens to provide it?Sue CoppolaWinter Garden, Fla.Capitalism, as it was embraced by we college-bound baby boomers 55 or 60 years ago, included the opportunity to earn one\u2019s way through a prestigious university via summer and part-time jobs, and to graduate debt free. Annual tuition at Caltech when I enrolled in 1956 was $750, which wasn\u2019t a burden to self-finance with personal earnings. Such opportunities are long gone and will never return, at least for brick-and-mortar institutions.The blame for today\u2019s situation should of course not be placed on capitalism, but on those whose policies and actions have distorted its application to tertiary education, such an important part of a young person\u2019s life.Jim SorensenAllentown, Pa.Joseph Schumpeter offers an explanation of why capitalism is rejected by young Americans: The expansion of education produces an oversupply of the white-collar educated. Many of them have no marketable skills (arts and soft-science majors?) and become the unemployed educated, who then \u201cdrift into the vocations in which standards are least definite. . . . They swell the host of intellectuals . . .

But its rift with its OPEC allies has renewed worries that the cartel won\u2019t act together and cut enough oil supplies to raise prices.Oil prices have fallen almost 10% since OPEC renewed its supply-cutting agreement with Russia and other non-OPEC producers last month, with U.S. prices falling to less than $46 a barrel and Brent, the international benchmark, falling to about $48 a barrel.Oil markets have been also under pressure in part because Nigeria and Libya, who are exempt from the output cuts, were boosting production.OPEC delegates have said that the political dispute is unlikely to weaken the supply deal.\u00a0OPEC has previously managed to keep its production policies implemented even as its members fought\u00a0wars through the organization\u2019s 57-year history, including the conflict between Iran and Iraq in the 1980s and       Saddam Hussein\u2019s       invasion of Kuwait in 1990.Qatar has played an important role in brokering oil deals among OPEC members in the past.

This act rested on three pillars: strict workplace verification, enhanced border security and amnesty. Since only the last item came to pass, the act failed as a compromise among interest groups. The act succeeded in sending a loud and clear message to the world that the U.S. had thrown in the towel on the effective policing of illegal immigration.Instead, Mr. Galston mentions a decade-old commission of globalists, nominally from both political parties which wisely recommended a shift toward the Australian/Canadian skills-based immigration model and resumption of the Bracero program.

As always, remember I am just one man, and a man who enjoys eating Pringles alone in bed:1. If you come: Paris is not really an eating and drinking town, so be sure to stop off and load up at the airport Chili\u2019s for margaritas and chips before you come here. I\u2019d probably pack a couple of turkey and cheese foot-longs from Subway as well, and maybe ship some red wine from Trader Joe\u2019s to your Paris hotel.2. Kidding, of course. From breakfast through a late-night dinner, it is quite hard to have a bad dining experience in Paris\u2014even on the grounds of a major sporting event like the French Open. I\u2019m not saying the dining at Roland Garros should win a pair of Michelin stars\u2014it\u2019s still stadium food\u2014but any place where they\u2019ll whip you up a crepe with Nutella two minutes before match time is reasonably close to heaven.3. I did stop at             Starbucks                   on my way to the women\u2019s final. Is that a crime? Je t\u2019aime Starbucks! Are they going to detain me at the airport on Monday for this?4. You are going to be a slob here. I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t care if your friends all say you have great style. You know how at MIT, everyone is a valedictorian who got perfect scores on their SATs? That\u2019s what it\u2019s like here on the grounds of the French. The competition is intense. A solid 93% of the men are dressed like peak Vincent Cassel\u2014fitted shirts and pants, blazers, all cut narrow and sharp. (French men have mastered the suit without a tie, whereas American men always tend to look unraveled, like they\u2019re checking into a Hampton Inn at 3 a.m.) And the women? As chic as Marianne Cotillard. Really: the whole style vibe here makes Augusta National look like a Limp Bizkit concert. Even the little kids are dressed immaculately. I don\u2019t know how French parents do it. It takes me an hour to convince my children to put on socks.5. Even if you bring your absolute finest, it\u2019s probably not going to be enough. I\u2019m not trying to bring you down, people. I\u2019m being honest. For the men\u2019s semifinals, I tucked my finely-pressed dress shirt into my finely-pressed dress shorts\u2014the only time I tuck a dress shirt into my shorts is for Easter brunch, and that\u2019s just for 10 minutes. But even like that, the crowd at Roland Garros made me feel like I was walking around in Spider Man pajamas. Embarrassed, I debated going into the Lacoste boutique and giving myself a top-to-bottom makeover, but I had one look at the prices and realized I would have to sell my car and probably my kids.6. I know what you\u2019re thinking: shorts? As always, I turn to my male style mentor, designer Tom Ford\u2014who is, to be clear, a vicious critic of shorts. \u201cA man should never wear shorts in the city,\u201d Ford once said. \u201cFlip-flops and shorts in the city are never appropriate.\u201d And yet, Ford offered a caveat: shorts could be worn on a tennis court. And while I am technically not on the tennis court here in Paris, I am very close to it, close enough that I think Tom Ford would give me a shorts pass. Oh, who am I kidding: he\u2019d probably throw up.7. Hats! Hats are really a thing here. And I don\u2019t mean hats like my pre-distressed University of Wisconsin Bucky Badger baseball hat, which basically makes me look like I\u2019m wearing a pair of old red underpants on my head. I\u2019m talking about super-classy lightweight Panama and trilby hats you see on three out of every four heads here, which adds yet another layer of chic to the place. You know how you look at old photos of Yankee games and everyone\u2019s in a hat and you think: Dang, American sports crowds have really lost their ability to dress. I am having that feeling a lot here. By the way, most of the cheaper hats have sold out on the grounds, but there are still some Superfino Montecristi Panama hats around for just \u20ac549, so just Venmo it to me and I\u2019ll pick a few up for you\u2014you know, for your next Philadelphia Eagles game.8. The French Open merchandising may be expensive, but it is probably the best sports merch I\u2019ve seen at a sporting event, because it\u2019s not trying too hard. I don\u2019t know where we went wrong in the U.S., but 98% of our sports merchandizing is mortifying to wear outside a stadium. I actually feel bad for American athletes when they hand out those T-shirts and hats to championship teams\u2014they\u2019re over-designed and awful. I adore the U.S. Open in tennis, but they try to make merch for everybody\u2014Want a U.S. Open shirt in day-glo pink camouflage? They got it! The French, by contrast, gives you a handful of options, and that\u2019s it, buddy. This is fine! I bought my 2-year-old and 4-year-old official Roland Garros sweatshirts that say J\u2019PEUX PAS / JE SUIS A ROLAND (\u201cI can\u2019t, I\u2019m in Roland\u201d) and they\u2019re so adorable I don\u2019t want the kids to ever grow up. They did cost as much as a plane ticket to Miami, but whatever.9. The thing that really struck me upon arrival at Roland Garros: the scale. This place is a jewel box\u2014the entire grounds look like it could fit neatly into Arthur Ashe Stadium. Structures are handsomely old. Ivy abounds. Philippe Chatrier, the main court, fits 15,000 and yet it feels compact, intimate, more like a living room than a super structure. The U.S. is obsessed with making its sports stadia into modernist cathedrals\u2014we don\u2019t really build sports-watching environments anymore, but instead giant tuna cans that can be spotted from outer space. The French Open shows there\u2019s nothing wrong with staying small, with favoring detail over size, with focusing on the game-watching experience versus luxury corpo-entertainment. Don\u2019t get me wrong: Roland Garros has plenty of catering for the muckety-mucks, but it\u2019s quiet, not the lavish suite-shaming that happens in American arenas.10. But then there\u2019s this: much to the chagrin of neighboring botanical experts, Roland Garros is embarking on a major reconstruction and modernization project\u2014adding a roof atop Philippe-Chatrier, as well as a replacement for the beloved \u201cbullring\u201d Court 1. The facility wants to be a showcase piece in Paris\u2019s bid for the 2024 Olympic Games. Yes: this means there\u2019s a chance they\u2019re going to ruin everything I just raved about. Then again, they\u2019re claiming the reboot preserves RG\u2019s savoir-faire and includes lots of \u201cvegetal architecture,\u201d so maybe not.11. Is the French Open a \u201csports bucket list\u201d item? Mais oui, bien sur. I think it qualifies because it\u2019s thoroughly its own thing, unlike anything you\u2019ll encounter in the States. It\u2019s manicured, beautiful, fashionable, elegant, sophisticated\u2014basically the polar opposite of a Knicks game. I detest most \u201cin my day\u201d sports nostalgia, but it\u2019s absolutely true that you don\u2019t find many sporting scenes like this anymore, where the tiniest details are as memorable as the biggest. I haven\u2019t even gotten to the tennis\u2014and how clay is a genre of tennis unto itself, one that can reward the cunning as much as the powerful. I grew up watching this tournament on TV, and the first time I saw that red surface in person, sunlit in the early afternoon, it felt close to tennis church.

A few years ago, she stopped.At that time, the 32-year-old Los Angeles freelance copywriter says her job was in a casual office environment where she was allowed to wear leggings. She wasn\u2019t impressed with what denim makers were offering. \u201cI did have a lot of jeans, and the style for a while wasn\u2019t changing,\u201d she says.With the rise of leggings and athleisure styles, jeans have faded as the symbol of casual wear. Sales dropped 4.5% in 2014 and 3.4% in 2015, according to market researcher Euromonitor. Denim makers languished on innovation in design and function, industry experts say.But fashion momentum is shifting back to denim. Sales were up 1.7% in 2016 and are expected to rise 2.2% this year, according to Euromonitor, aided by emerging vintage trends and a push to add flexibility and comfort.Ms. Lacey says she now owns nine pairs of jeans, nearly all of them purchased in the past year\u2014and says new fits and finishes enticed her to buy again. She favors sailor-fit jeans, high-waisted and cropped with a wider leg, but she also has snapped up pairs with silhouettes she hadn\u2019t seen before inspired by 1980s and \u201990s style. \u201cIt feels really fresh,\u201d Ms. Lacey says. \u201cI want to have all of them.\u201dThat is welcome news for the $18 billion U.S. denim business, whose big players include Levi Strauss & Co. and             Gap Inc.\u2019s       Old Navy.Low-rise skinny jeans dominated shelves for too long, says NPD Group analyst Marshal Cohen. The styles grew stale, as people either didn\u2019t fit into them or didn\u2019t need to buy more of them.Meanwhile, they were starting to wear more-comfortable casual styles more often. \u201cWe saw this element of extreme casualization in play that made it acceptable to wear sports apparel beyond the intended purpose of playing sports,\u201d says       James Curleigh,        president of the Levi\u2019s brand for Levi Strauss & Co. \u201cWe saw women wearing yoga pants to dinner.\u201dBy 2014, headlines were declaring denim in danger. In 2015,       Tom Brady       was splayed out in the pages of GQ wearing a $375 sports jacket with $50             Under Armour                   sweatpants. In that same year, Levi\u2019s admitted there was a problem.\u201cThe market has moved to super-stretchy, supersoft fabric, and we\u2019re out there with more rigid fabric,\u201d Levi\u2019s Chief Executive Chip Bergh told analysts at the time. \u201cWe missed from a product standpoint, is kind of the real quick and dirty\u2026and so we\u2019re scrambling.\u201dAlison Partridge, vice president of women\u2019s merchandising at Gap Inc.\u2019s Old Navy, says athleisure\u2019s focus on comfort has pushed the denim industry to evolve and innovate. \u201cThe athleisure trend may be the best thing that has happened to denim,\u201d she says.Old Navy challenged itself to make denim that would fit and perform the way leggings do, but would look like a pair of jeans, Ms. Partridge says. Last year, the brand launched its \u201cBuilt-in Sculpt\u201d denim line that is almost twice as stretchy as its standard jeans. And it isn\u2019t just for women: Old Navy now includes stretch denim across men\u2019s and children\u2019s lines.Levi\u2019s began its pivot in 2014 by creating an athletic fit for men and relaunched its entire women\u2019s line in 2015. Last year, it altered an iconic product, introducing stretch into its 501 jeans, the first blue jean, created nearly a century and a half ago for the likes of cowboys and miners. The 2016 change was almost contradictory, adding softness to denim, which was historically built to be durable.VF Corp.\u2019s       Lee Jeans revamped its denim last year, with a campaign emphasizing stretch and fit. Its new \u201cDream Jean\u201d promised to \u201clook like a skinny jean outside and feel like a yoga pant inside.\u201dNow, while athleticwear sales are still growing at rates quadruple those of denim, growth has begun to slow: Sales of leggings\u201d were up 6.8% in 2016 versus 7.6% in 2015, and \u201csports-inspired apparel\u201d sales grew 6.3% versus 6.9%. Overabundance and a lack of innovation, some of the same reasons jeans washed out, may be factors.Mr. Cohen says he isn\u2019t convinced the denim goodwill will last: Much of jeans makers\u2019 comeback has been fueled by the vintage resurgence rather than their own style innovations.\u201cIt\u2019s in a reactive mode,\u201d Mr. Cohen says. \u201cIn 18 months, retailers will have to earn it on their own.\u201dAnd the competition isn\u2019t sitting back\u2014            Nike Inc.       recently scored a patent for \u201carchitecturally reinforced denim\u201d designed with athletic endeavors in mind.Write to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Blue Jeans Are Getting Their Game Back.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/blue-jeans-get-their-game-back-1497186001", "news_title": "Blue Jeans Get Their Game Back ", "keywords": "athleisure,built-in sculpt jean,dream jean,jeans with stretch,levi's 501 jeans,marshal cohen,most comfortable jeans,stretch jeans,Levi Strauss &,Gap,GPS,Alison Partridge,Chip Bergh,corporate,industrial news,clothing,cut,sew clothing,textiles,consumer goods"}, {"content": "You might\u2019ve heard that             Facebook Inc.        FB 0.79%       is working on a way for you to message your friends and update your news feed...telepathically.When the company announced this at its annual F8 conference in mid-April, it was pretty vague about how the feat would be accomplished. Turns out the plan includes building a technology that would, by itself, revolutionize how we study the human brain.Are the methods crazy? Yes. Do neuroscientists and engineers outside Facebook express extreme doubt this will succeed? Yes. Facebook doesn\u2019t care and is investing millions in research that could produce a consumer gadget.After I spoke with project members, based at Facebook\u2019s mysterious Building 8 incubator for moonshots, it became clear that the company\u2019s larger goal is to make a handful of long-term bets on technologies that could define the next era of computing.When your face is stuck inside a VR headset or you\u2019re out walking around wearing a pair of augmented-reality glasses, you can\u2019t exactly reach for a keyboard or mouse, says Mark Chevillet, a physicist and neuroscientist who is Facebook\u2019s technical lead on the as-yet-unnamed project.The initiative would give Facebook a way to control those systems hands-free. Messaging is just the beginning. Facebook isn\u2019t working on a brain implant\u2014though other Silicon Valley giants are. The answer could ultimately be as simple as a headband.To pull it off, Facebook has enlisted a small in-house team, supplemented by 60 scientists and engineers from research institutions across the U.S., all receiving funding from Facebook. Their goal is to update an obscure, largely abandoned technology known as \u201cfast optical scattering,\u201d aka \u201cevent-related optical signal.\u201d Basically, you shine a light through the head and into the brain, then measure the light reflected back.It sounds bonkers, but in one way or another, scientists have been using light to peer into the body for nearly a century.When this technique is used on lab animals, their brains are exposed and researchers can directly observe brain cells expanding and contracting as they fire. The challenge for Dr. Chevillet\u2019s team is to accomplish the same thing in intact humans, when there\u2019s a layer of skull, skin and hair in the way. It\u2019s a problem that to date has been impossible to surmount.If you\u2019ve ever pressed a flashlight into your hand and seen it glow, you know how light can make its way through human flesh. Facebook\u2019s researchers think they have a chance of success because they\u2019re developing sensors to identify the small number of photons that, after penetrating the skull and bouncing off a neuron, return to the detector instead of scattering in every direction.Sensor technology that could in theory accomplish this\u2014developed at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and funded almost exclusively by the U.S. Department of Defense\u2014has to date benefited things like sonars, space exploration and observing the ground from the air through dense foliage. Thus far, the technology hasn\u2019t been pressed against anyone\u2019s head.Krishna Shenoy,        a pioneering neuroprosthetics researcher at Stanford University, says if there\u2019s any evidence Facebook\u2019s team could sense brain activity from outside the skull nearly as accurately as with implants, he hasn\u2019t seen it. Dr. Shenoy and his team have experimented with having humans type eight words a minute by moving a cursor on a virtual keyboard through thought alone\u2014but even that required a brain implant.And repurposing U.S. military technology to observe the machinery of thought is only half of the Facebook research team\u2019s problem. The other challenge is transforming brain readings into actual words.Alexander Huth,        of the University of California, Berkeley, isn\u2019t connected to Facebook\u2019s project but has been working on how brains process language for eight years. His research revealed that words\u2014and the concepts that underlie them\u2014are spread across the surface of our brains. By observing which parts of a brain are active, you might be able to determine the word, or at least concept, that someone is thinking.Dr. Huth argues that the greatest challenge in \u201creading\u201d minds is that we still know so little about how language works.At Building 8, they\u2019re approaching this in a quintessentially Facebook way: by throwing artificial intelligence at it. Dr. Chevillet says that if he and his team can get enough data from the right parts of the brain, they could train a machine-learning algorithm that correlates neural activity with language to extract words from our heads. The method would be similar to how scientists train computers to understand spoken language.I explained Facebook\u2019s plan to       Richard Barbour,        managing vice president of NIRx Medical Technologies, a pioneer of a related (but distinct) light-based brain-imaging tech used in laboratories all over the world. His response was a long pause.\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t be my approach.\u201dAs risky as all this sounds, Facebook isn\u2019t just shooting in the dark. The research program at Building 8 is managed by       Regina Dugan,        who comes from the DOD\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency by way of Google. The sizable project budgets come with strict two-year deadlines. Still, none of the tech giants who hire academics to research topics in their skunkworks have, to date, yielded much in the way of out-of-the-box breakthroughs.\u201cWe accept that this problem is high risk, high reward,\u201d says Dr. Chevillet.Write to Christopher Mims at christopher.mims@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-11 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-facebooks-telepathic-texting-is-supposed-to-work-1497182402", "news_title": "How Facebook\u2019s Telepathic Texting Is Supposed to Work ", "keywords": "ai,artificial intelligence,augmented-reality,facebook,facebook building 8,facebook telepathic texting,future of computing,future of texting,human brain,johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory ,krishna shenoy,mark chevillet,neuroscience,sensor technology,telepathic texting, virtual keyboard,vr,Facebook,FB,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,research,development,information technology,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,computer science,living,lifestyle,personal technology,sciences,humanities,artificial intelligence technologies,internet,online,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "A church and a developer have teamed up to use passive-construction standards for a 174-apartment building in Jamaica, Queens, joining a growing list of larger-scale New York City developments embracing\u00a0these ultra-energy-efficient building methods.Passive-design principles focus on creating airtight buildings and maintaining comfortable temperatures while dramatically reducing the use of mechanical heating or cooling systems. Proponents say the process, which relies on high-quality materials and components such as windows and doors as well as advanced ventilation systems, can reduce energy use for heating and cooling by as much as 90%.\u201cThere is definitely a push toward passive-house or at least more energy-efficient design,\u201d said       Eric Bluestone,        a partner at the Bluestone Organization, which was tapped by First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica as its partner for the Queens project. He noted, \u201cWhat has become our standard construction method is very close to passive house design.\u201dIn 2010, the New York region had about 50,000 square feet of passive-design building projects planned, said       Ken Levenson,        founding board member of New York Passive House, a nonprofit organization that provides education and promotes passive-design methods and principles. Today he estimates well over 3.5 million square feet of passive-design projects are in the pipeline.Until the last few years, buildings in New York City incorporating passive design standards tended to fall in the smaller size range. But that has been changing as developers of bigger projects, especially affordable-housing builders, have been aiming to reduce operating costs and boost energy-efficiency levels.Called Tree of Life, the 174-apartment project, which was expected to break ground on Friday, will also house First Presbyterian\u2019s community-services center and a health clinic at 89-48 164th St. in Jamaica. The $74 million development includes a solar-power system on its roof. The church tapped Bluestone as its partner because of its experience in energy-efficient construction, said Rev. Patrick O\u2019Connor, First Presbyterian\u2019s senior pastor. Bluestone is about to complete a passive-design, affordable building with 101 units in the Rockaways.Building to passive standards can raise costs between 3% and 6% \u00a0above the expenses for typical construction, but building owners save down the road on lower operating costs, proponents said.Earlier this year, the city selected a team of developers led by Jonathan Rose Cos. for an East Harlem affordable development that will include about 650 apartments in three buildings, a YMCA, a school and a community health center. Building to passive standards was a requirement.\u201cIt\u2019s a large enough scale that we hope we will learn a lot about how you can build affordable housing that meets very aspirational standards for efficiency in a way that adds no costs or reasonable costs,\u201d said       Fred Harris,        managing director of development for Jonathan Rose Cos.In 2012, there were only about 10 certified residential units in North America, said       Katrin Klingenberg,        executive director of Passive House US, non-profit that provides passive-house certification and training and has established standards for North American climates. By 2016, there were 1,000 certified units, she said.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good growth rate,\u201d Ms. Klingenberg said. \u201cMost of the growth is driven by affordable-housing developers.\u201dPerhaps the city\u2019s most prominent passive-design project is the House at Cornell Tech. The 26-story residence for students and faculty on Roosevelt Island, one of the world\u2019s tallest residential high-rises under construction, will open at Cornell University\u2019s new technology campus in August. The university and the tower\u2019s developer, a partnership of the Hudson Cos. and Related Cos., were aiming to be \u201cas thought-provoking and innovative and energy-conscious as possible,\u201d said       Jennifer Klein,        assistant director of strategic-capital partnerships at Cornell Tech.Such projects have encouraged other developers to learn about passive standards, proponents of passive design said. And they are hoping eventually the concept will be more routine.\u201cI honestly believe it will become normal within 10 years in New York,\u201d said Mr. Levenson.", "news_time": "2017-06-11 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/striving-for-energy-efficiency-in-new-york-1497182400", "news_title": "Striving for Energy-Efficiency in New York", "keywords": "Eric Bluestone,Fred Harris,Jennifer Klein,Katrin Klingenberg,Ken Levenson,building construction,residential building construction,construction,real estate"}, {"content": "Relatively few people in history\u2014even musical virtuosos\u2014have been known to possess perfect pitch, the ability to identify or reproduce any musical note without having another note with which to compare it. Mozart was said to be one of those people. Ella Fitzgerald was another. The trait is so rare, it is estimated that only 1 in 10,000 people can tell an F-sharp from a B-flat in Western cultures, where the gift has been widely studied.But can perfect pitch, also known as absolute pitch, be learned?It\u2019s complicated. One expert, Joseph P. Bradley, an otolaryngologist and assistant professor at the Washington University Voice & Airway Center, sounds out the question, with a look at neuroplasticity and the upside of speaking Mandarin.Everyone hears the same sounds, but not with the same acuity. What differs is how a person\u2019s auditory cortex of the brain processes that sound after it moves from the inner ear, Dr. Bradley says. People with perfect pitch can identify as little as a 6% difference in frequency.Being able to distinguish an out-of-tune note or a subtle shift in tone can help professional musicians improvise better and compose complicated pieces more easily, or even play or sing in two different keys simultaneously. For the rest of us, having a \u201cgreat ear\u201d might make music sound more beautiful and allow us to more strongly connect sounds to experiences.But while many people believe they have a good ear, few actually do. The professor himself is a trained singer, and took a test online to check his pitch\u2014\u201cwhich was worse than I thought, given my music background,\u201d he says.Studies have shown that perfect pitch is at least in part linked to genetics, Dr. Bradley says. Early exposure to music and musical training are known to help tune the ear to hear subtle tonal shifts, especially if they occur around age 3 or 4 through about age 7, a period of extreme neuroplasticity when the brain is particularly pliable.Most parents might not even pick up on signs that their child is born with perfect pitch, though the clues are there. \u201cYou might have a child that will say, \u2018Oh, that part of the piece sounded out of tune,\u2019 but it sounded normal to you,\u201d says Dr. Bradley, who works with singers facing voice and upper-airway issues. Music teachers may remark that a child needs very little coaching to play an instrument or sing in tune.Until recently, no evidence of an adult acquiring perfect pitch had been documented. But a 2013 study published in Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience showed adults could gain the trait with the help of valproic acid, a drug used to treat seizures and migraines.\u201cThe evidence suggests the medication restores the brain\u2019s plasticity to that of a child, and then adults can train to learn perfect pitch,\u201d says Dr. Bradley. It is unknown whether the effects are lasting once people come off the drug, he adds, \u201cand the medicine has its fair share of side effects,\u201d such as hair loss and dizziness.Even with years of training, not everyone can learn to identify an A4 note from a G4, says Dr. Bradley, \u201cbut almost anyone can learn to hear if a note is in or out of tune.\u201dSome people seem to be at an advantage. At least one study has shown that native speakers of tonal languages\u2014such as Mandarin or Vietnamese, in which changing pitch alters the meaning of the same sounds\u2014who also train in music at a young age, can translate the precision they hear in spoken sounds to musical ones.In that study, published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America in 2006, 60% of Beijing natives who began taking music lessons before age 5 passed a test for perfect pitch, while only 14% of Americans did. But because all the participants were ethnically Asian, says Dr. Bradley, \u201cthe evidence doesn\u2019t clearly point one way or another whether the trait is genetic or learned.\u201dIt might be both. \u201cThe fact that these native Chinese speakers learned to recognize tonal nuances at the same time as they were learning music and going through a period of extreme neuroplasticity may all be related,\u201d he says.Whether learning a tonal language as an adult can lead to acquiring absolute pitch has yet to be proven. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating idea,\u201d he says, \u201cbut even if you don\u2019t have perfect pitch, you can still enjoy music.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-11 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-perfect-pitch-be-learned-1497178800", "news_title": "Can Perfect Pitch Be Learned?", "keywords": "political,general news,health"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014China\u2019s government is working to keep climate-change cooperation with the U.S. alive after President       Donald Trump\u2019s       decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, even if that means sidestepping the White House to seek closer ties with U.S. states.Meetings in Beijing during the past week showed the competing agendas in U.S. energy politics and deep frustration inside China\u2019s government over Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to abandon what had been a rare platform for unity in the U.S.-China relationship.China rolled out the red carpet for California Gov.       Jerry Brown,        a critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision who arrived in China last weekend to take part in an international clean-energy forum and meet provincial officials. It was Mr. Brown that President       Xi Jinping       later welcomed to Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People; U.S. Energy Secretary       Rick Perry,        also in town for the forum, was received by a vice premier.Chinese officials expressed dismay with Mr. Trump\u2019s decision. \u201cI am so deeply disappointed,\u201d said Xie Zhenhua, China\u2019s special envoy for climate change, during a gathering with Mr. Brown.Since Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, a coalition of a dozen U.S. states, including California, have committed to uphold America\u2019s pledge to cut emissions 26% to 28% compared with 2005 levels.For Beijing, working with U.S. states could burnish the image the country has sought to cultivate as an emerging global leader on climate issues. Some states can also share emissions-cutting expertise that leaders here are eager to acquire.Mr. Xi sent perhaps the strongest signal that he hopes to see more local-level cooperation by meeting Gov. Brown.Among the agreements Mr. Brown\u2019s office announced during the week included plans to coordinate emission-reduction programs with China\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology and to set up a joint climate research institute between California and China\u2019s Tsinghua University.China is encouraging \u201call relevant parties to implement the Paris agreement,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Friday when asked about Mr. Brown\u2019s visit.Local U.S.-China cooperation has limits: National governments are needed to negotiate deals keeping world leaders marching in the same direction. Lacking a U.S. commitment, Mr. Xie, the Chinese climate envoy, used a gathering at Tsinghua University to urge U.S. and Chinese scientists and business leaders to step up cooperation.Mr. Brown said he hopes more states and cities will join him in opposing Mr. Trump\u2019s stance. \u201cWith Trump saying no, it\u2019s up to states and localities to say yes\u2014and they\u2019re doing that,\u201d he said.Mr. Perry said he supported the rights of states to choose their own paths. \u201cMy hat\u2019s off to Gov. Brown for the work that he does to promote California,\u201d he said in Beijing on Friday. He said he faced no pressure from those he met for the U.S. to change its mind about leaving the Paris deal.Mr. Perry\u2019s arrival in China early in the week was preceded by the surprise announcement on Monday by the top U.S. diplomat in China, David Rank, that he was quitting to protest against Mr. Trump\u2019s climate position. Mr. Rank, who was charg\u00e9 d\u2019affairs, had been expected to accompany Mr. Perry in meetings with Chinese officials.Mr. Perry explained the Trump administration\u2019s position on energy as an effort to balance economic growth with cleaning up the environment. He expressed support for fossil fuels, including coal and natural gas\u2014both of which are abundant in the U.S. and could be sold to China in greater quantities.The Trump administration says the U.S. has done more to reduce emissions than other top emitters, including China, outside agreements under the Paris accord. The White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the China-California talks.During the Obama administration, China and the U.S. looked to broad agreement on climate change as a chance to showcase joint purpose in an often fraught relationship. Without the cooperation between the two biggest emitters, the Paris accord is unlikely to have gotten off the ground.China and other major emitters said they would follow through on their commitments despite Mr. Trump\u2019s decision.How aggressively Beijing moves to cut emission levels after they peak by about 2030\u2014as China has pledged to do\u2014may depend on whether the U.S. is also on board. Reaching the global goal of limiting the increase in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels would require significant cuts by China.The dueling messages from Messrs. Perry and Brown contrasted with the united front Chinese officials present on major policy moves.Zhou Dadi,        vice president of the Beijing-backed Energy Research Institute, said China recognizes that the U.S. system allows states and cities to shape their own positions on the Paris commitments.\u201cIn the United States, local governments can play a more important role,\u201d Mr. Zhou said, drawing a distinction with China\u2019s more centralized decision-making.China\u2019s president alluded to that difference in his meeting Tuesday with Mr. Brown, the governor said. Mr. Xi\u2019s message, he said: \u201cWhen we set our minds to something we mobilize our society and make it happen.\u201dWrite to Brian Spegele at brian.spegele@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'China Sidesteps Trump on Climate.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-engages-california-on-climate-after-trumps-paris-snub-1497178806", "news_title": "China Engages California on Climate After Trump\u2019s Paris Snub ", "keywords": "global warming,paris accord,paris agreement,paris climate agreement,Xi Jinping,Donald Trump,Jerry Brown,Rick Perry,political,general news,climate change,international relations,natural environment,global,world issues,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "ROCKFORD, Ill.\u2014Illinois Rep.\u00a0      Cheri\u00a0Bustos      \u00a0is the only member of Democratic Party leadership from the Midwest, and now she has a new job: tutoring her fellow House Democrats on talking to the rural voters that her party has lost to Republicans.As one of just 12 Democratic House lawmakers representing a district carried by President       Donald Trump       in last year\u2019s election, the future of Ms.\u00a0Bustos\u2019s party may depend on her instruction.\u201cIf Democrats can\u2019t do a better job of reaching out to rural voters and getting more of their votes, they\u2019re going to be consigned a permanent minority status in Washington and state legislatures,\u201d said       Robin Johnson,        a part-time professor at Monmouth College in Illinois.Last August, as Democrats sent lawmakers home for recess, leadership encouraged them to use the summer break to talk about the economy, national security and to attack GOP counterparts for not acting on legislation to curb Zika, the mosquito-borne illness that was then the current public health crisis.\u201cIt was like \u2018what?\u2019 \u201d 55-year-old Ms.\u00a0Bustos\u00a0said of her first reaction to the emphasis on what was then an isolated East Coast issue. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not Florida.

Some 23 House Republicans represent districts that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won in November, suggesting that those seats could be in play next year.But Democrats will also need to win areas of the map they have struggled with, and Ms.\u00a0Bustos\u00a0is recruiting potential candidates and helping create a game plan.Her guidance is \u201cdon\u2019t write off small towns,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t write off the counties in your district that have gone Republican for the last several elections. Don\u2019t talk down to anybody. Whether they voted for Donald Trump or voted for       Bernie Sanders,        talk to people, listen to people.\u201dMs. Bustos, drinking coffee on an all-but-abandoned Main Street, said she knows why Mr. Trump\u2019s message resonated in Rockford, Ill., what used to be known as \u201cScrew City\u201d until the factories once located here mostly moved overseas. The president\u2019s promise of bringing jobs back hit home, she said.\u201cI certainly don\u2019t argue with people about voting for Donald Trump, but we do talk about some of the promises he made and where he\u2019s falling short right now,\u201d Ms.\u00a0Bustos\u00a0said. She said she keeps\u00a0track of how often she visits the 14 counties in her district, ensuring that no corner, or grocery store, is ignored.Wandering through a Schnucks supermarket\u00a0on June 1, Ms. Bustos paused in the egg aisle to introduce herself to       Phyllis Jensen,        64, and       Keith Nielsen,        52, and asked of their biggest concern.Their answer: pending health-care legislation, specifically the impact it may have to the couple\u2019s mounting medical bills because of Mr. Nielsen\u2019s disability. The Democratic lawmaker asked how the couple paid for the care, where they worked, how much each treatment cost.It is part of the lawmaker\u2019s district-focused approach that helped her win her election by about 20 percentage points in 2016. Mr. Trump narrowly defeated Mrs. Clinton in the district by seven-tenths of a percentage point.While Democratic leadership spent much of 2016 and the time after the election focused on being anti-Trump, it is shifting advice to encourage lawmakers to \u201cexplain what you are doing to help people improve life,\u201d instead of talking about the probe of Russia meddling in the presidential and any Trump campaign ties to it, said Rep.       Joe Crowley       (D., N.Y.), the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. \u201cAs much as Trump is still the top of the headlines, it\u2019s also about what\u2019s happening in your districts.\u201dMs.\u00a0Bustos\u00a0teamed up with fellow Democratic Rep.       Ron Kind      \u00a0last month\u00a0for listening sessions in southern Wisconsin. Mr. Kind, who also represents a district that Mr. Trump won, said he has seen a rise in energy from the left since the election, and called the president\u2019s first budget \u201calmost a declaration of war to rural America\u201d because of the cuts to federal programs that help agricultural areas and said it was a sign he was \u201ccompletely oblivious to where his political support came from.\u201dRep.       Dave Loebsack       (D., Iowa), who also represents a Trump district, said he has focused on expanding broadband access in rural areas and economic development.\u201cI go to where people, work, live and play,\u201d Mr. Loebsack said. \u201cI\u2019ll go out to a farm and we may not agree on all the issues, but I\u2019ll go there and hear them out.\u201dWhen asked by a constituent recently\u00a0at a local rotary club in Knoxville, Iowa, if Mr. Trump would be impeached as a result the way he has managed a probe into his presidential campaign\u2019s alleged ties to Russia, Mr. Loebsack stuck to neutral ground. The investigations into collusion with Russia should continue to unfold, he said, adding that he had his own concerns.Mr. Trump or the tensions in his administration aren\u2019t typically issues that Ms.\u00a0Bustos\u00a0brings up with her constituents, and she doesn\u2019t go out of her way to mention gay marriage or gun control. Her party must tie itself to supportive economic policies and not social issues, she said.\u201cWhen somebody sees a \u2018D\u2019 by somebody\u2019s name, we want them to think about \u2018yeah, they\u2019re the ones fighting for us,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to work on, is to change that overall view, when somebody is labeled a Democrat, and I think we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in that area.\u201dWrite to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-11 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-look-to-cheri-bustos-to-map-path-to-rural-votes-1497178805", "news_title": "Democrats Look to Cheri Bustos to Map Path to Rural Votes", "keywords": "democratic party,democrats,donald trump,heartland,house democrats,house majority,rural voters,rural votes,swing states,Donald Trump,Cheri\u00a0Bustos,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Call it the post-\u201cHamilton\u201d Tony Awards.This year\u2019s edition of Broadway\u2019s big night won\u2019t have a blockbuster musical to honor and celebrate. But as a result, it could be all the more interesting. The competition is much more intense in certain award categories.And there is a sense that Broadway is now stronger than ever, in large part because its success is predicated on far more than one show. The grosses this past season\u2014a record $1.45 billion\u2014speak to that.The show kicks off from New York City\u2019s Radio City Music Hall on Sunday at 8 p.m. ET on             CBS.       What can viewers expect? Here are five things to look for\u20261. A real race for best musical. Early in the season, it seemed as if \u201cDear       Evan Hansen,       \u201d the show that chronicles a socially awkward teen\u2019s rise to fame via social media, was going to be the clear Tony favorite. But now, the picture is a bit murkier. For starters, \u201cNatasha,       Pierre       & the Great Comet of 1812,\u201d the Russian-inspired romp starring       Josh Groban,        earned the most nominations (12) of all shows, including a best musical nod.There\u2019s also the category\u2019s upstart contender: \u201cCome From Away,\u201d which tells the true story of how a Canadian town helped stranded travelers in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. Some Broadway insiders say \u201cCome From Away,\u201d which opened later in the season, could walk away with the honor because it\u2019s a feel-good show that plays well with a broader audience.2. A real race for best play. It would appear that       Lynn Nottage\u2019s       \u201cSweat,\u201d an emotionally charged look at the struggles of the American working class, would have the edge in the category. It\u2019s already received the Pulitzer Prize. But there is also much support for       J.T. Rogers\u2019s       \u201cOslo,\u201d a deep dive into a critical moment in Mideast relations.And don\u2019t forget       Lucas Hnath\u2019s       breakout hit \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2,\u201d which continues the story of the       Ibsen       classic in decidedly quirky fashion. \u201cDoll\u2019s House\u201d has seen its box-office numbers surge in recent weeks. Plus, all four of its cast members have been nominated for acting awards. In short, the best play category is about as wide-open as you can get.3. All bets are on Bette. There isn\u2019t much debate over who\u2019s going to win the award for best lead actress in a musical. Most prognosticators say       Bette Midler       has the category sewn up for her star turn in the revival of \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d So the question is more about how outrageous the Divine Miss M, never one to shy away from making salty or strong remarks, will be in her acceptance speech.When Ms. Midler won a special Tony back in 1974, she was certainly not shy: \u201cI always wanted one of these and I\u2019m glad I got it, cause I really worked my little fanny off for it, you understand?\u201d she said at the time.4. Will \u201cGreat Comet\u201d prove so great? A dozen nominations for \u201cGreat Comet\u201ddon\u2019t guarantee that it will walk away with many, if any, awards. Handicappers see it being shut out of the major categories beyond best musical. As critically acclaimed as Mr. Groban was as Pierre, the show\u2019s male principal, he is probably not going to beat       Ben Platt,        the star of \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201d.Still, don\u2019t be surprised if \u201cGreat Comet\u201d creator       Dave Malloy       picks up at least one trophy\u2014say, for best orchestrations.5. And don\u2019t forget the host\u2026In 2016, the Tony Awards telecast earned its highest ratings in 15 years with host       James Corden.       It is probably a tall order for       Kevin Spacey,        this year\u2019s pick, to continue that success.Despite his current popularity thanks to the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d series, Mr. Spacey is not seen as being as garrulous and goofy as his predecessor. (Don\u2019t expect any carpool karaoke-style bits.)But Mr. Spacey is a Tony winner and has shown himself to be a song-and-dance man in the       Bobby Darin       biopic, \u201cBeyond the Sea.\u201d As he told the Journal about the hosting gig, \u201cEveryone brings their own personality to it.\u201dWrite to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-11 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-things-to-watch-at-the-2017-tony-awards-1497178802", "news_title": "Five Things to Watch at the 2017 Tony Awards", "keywords": "a doll's house part 2,come from away,dear evan hansen,hello dolly,host,natasha,oslo, pierre & the great comet of 1812,sweat,tony awards,tonys,awards,political,general news,arts,entertainment,theater,reviews"}, {"content": "WATFORD CITY, N.D.\u2014Radio stations here are again running ads from\u00a0oil-field\u00a0companies seeking drivers and mechanics. A store\u00a0is\u00a0serving up an alligator-and-crawfish lunch to welcome workers\u00a0from the Gulf Coast. New rigs are rising across the sprawling prairie.Drillers are inching back to action in North Dakota\u2019s Bakken shale region, a sign the recovery of the American oil and gas sector is spreading beyond the Texas and Oklahoma fields, where production is cheaper because there is more oil that is easier to tap.The revival after a nearly three-year bust is welcomed by local industry leaders, officials and merchants, who are grateful to see new signs of life in places such as Watford City, a community of about 6,400 people that was booming just a few years ago. The area is expected to get a boost from the June 1 start-up of the Dakota Access Pipeline, another conduit for oil out of the region. But some are concerned that too much too soon could send oil prices plunging once again.\u201cIt\u2019s a nice level of production that we hope will be sustainable,\u201d said Kari Cutting, vice president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council.Hess Corp.      ,             Continental Resources Inc.       and             Oasis Petroleum Inc.       are drilling new wells here or finishing ones earlier left uncompleted. Yet despite\u00a0technological improvements and cost cutting, only some producers can afford to drill in the Bakken at today\u2019s oil prices.And while shale companies are slowly recovering, prices remain volatile\u2014crude has declined 9% in the past three weeks, moving decisively below $50 a barrel.While some Bakken producers can break even at $40 oil, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie, most need upwards of $50 and wouldn\u2019t significantly increase activity until oil approached $60.Locals believe\u00a0$60 or $70 oil would be enough to keep the Bakken humming at a reasonable pace. Anything more,\u00a0they\u00a0fear, might bring back the chaos of the boom, when a huge influx of people and oilfield traffic overwhelmed\u00a0parts of North Dakota.As oil climbed over $100 in 2014, North Dakota\u2019s unemployment rate\u2014already consistently the lowest in the nation\u2014fell as low as 2.6%. The population grew more than 2% annually from\u00a02012 to 2015, adding 55,000 residents, a big influx for a state that even now has only about 758,000 people, federal estimates show.Some workers were making six-figure salaries\u00a0and regularly dropping hundreds of dollars on shots of\u00a0Louis\u00a0XIII\u00a0cognac in restaurants like the Williston Brewing\u00a0Company.\u00a0But skyrocketing rents forced many to live in trailers, tents and boxy, no-frills \u201cman camps.\u201dIn Watford, residents remembered traffic so heavy that some people couldn\u2019t make left turns out of their driveways. Things are calmer now, though many of the returning rigs are in surrounding McKenzie County.\u201cThe man camps around here still have people in them,\u201d said Stephen Stenehjem, chief executive of First International Bank\u00a0&\u00a0Trust,\u00a0based in Watford. \u201cThere\u2019s more traffic\u2026more rigs in the county, more frack crews in the county, more pipeline\u00a0getting\u00a0laid.\u201dIt is far from the peak of\u00a0218 rigs five years\u00a0ago, but\u00a0North Dakota\u2019s rig count has rebounded from a low of 27\u00a0in May 2016\u00a0to 51 today, state data show. Oil output has again topped 1 million barrels a day, after wobbling below that point\u00a0at the start of this year and for a few months in late 2016.A recent job fair in nearby Williston, a city of about 26,400 people, boasted 60 booths for employers with 1,500 openings, more than twice the number of job seekers that attended, said Cindy Sanford, a manager with the local branch of Job Service North Dakota,\u00a0a state employment agency.\u201cTons of jobs, not enough people,\u201d she said.The increasing activity was apparent at a site about an hour east of Williston, where Hess began operating a rig known as the B04 in March.\u00a0A\u00a0crew worked on one of five wells planned for the site, as a trio of pump jacks nodded nearby.Hess\u00a0has four Bakken rigs in place\u00a0and plans to have six by year-end.\u00a0It says it has\u00a0nearly 3,000 locations left to drill in the area\u2014half of which generate a 15% rate of return at $50 oil.\u201cWe compete very well with the Permian,\u201d\u00a0said       Mike Turner,        senior vice president of global production at Hess, referring to the region of Texas and New Mexico where much shale drilling has concentrated during the downturn in prices.Daniel Stenberg, McKenzie County\u2019s economic-development coordinator, said Watford is ready for any additional workers that arrive as a result of the Bakken\u2019s recovery. The city has a new high school next to its new sports and convention complex, and several newer housing developments.Williston is more developed, too, though declining sales-tax revenue\u00a0after oil went bust\u00a0caused the city to take on more than $200 million in debt to finish necessary infrastructure projects. While residents are happy about the amenities\u00a0sudden\u00a0oil money brought, including\u00a0newly paved roads and a fancy recreation center, few want to see the boom return full force.\u201cIt\u2019s a nice place right now,\u201d said Todd Williams, chief executive of S.I.R.

So Britain could be back to the polls in relatively little time. Likewise, if the Conservatives fail to get enough votes, it may have to turn to Labour, not least for the country\u2019s divorce from the European Union.Labour\u2019s\u00a0flagship economic policies\u00a0included increased taxes on corporations and the top 5% of earners, as well as increasing the minimum wage to an hourly \u00a310 (about $12.74) from its current \u00a36.70.The party has promised to nationalize utilities, rail companies and the             Royal Mail                   postal system. It also said it would launch a consultation on breaking up the banks and has pledged to take a \u201cnew approach\u201d to the publicly owned             Royal Bank of Scotland.The U.K\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit record highs this year, but investors have differentiated between those stocks exposed to Britain and those whose revenues come mainly from abroad.The FTSE 100, which makes more than two-thirds of its revenue outside of the U.K., is up 18.6% since last year\u2019s EU referendum. Meanwhile, the FTSE Local UK, which includes only stocks which make 30% or less of their revenue abroad, is up by just 0.7%.\u201cA number of stocks that could be vulnerable under a more interventionist government have been weak for some time,\u201d said Richard Colwell, head of U.K. equities at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, naming transport and utility stocks.The prospect of state intervention in companies is unlikely to endear many British stocks to international investors.\u201cThe U.K. market has been out of favor with international investors for some time,\u201d Mr. Colwell added. Asset allocation to U.K. equities is as low now as it was in 2008 at the height of the banking crisis, he said.Not all of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s positions are viewed negatively by investors.Indeed, many investors believe Mr. Corbyn\u2019s increased standing could in the long run help British markets, in particular the pound.Though the Labour Party says that it believes Brexit should go ahead, it is expected to push for\u00a0a so-called soft Brexit\u00a0and argue for less restraints in immigration, both of which many investors would welcome.Many analysts expected the sterling to rise if Mr. Corbyn was able to establish a minority government or exert influence on national policy.To be sure, many analysts believe it is too early to begin pricing in any potential effects of Mr. Corbyn.Market action on Friday suggests that most investors agree.             J.P. Morgan                   named six utility companies likely to be negatively impacted by Mr. Corbyn\u2019s nationalization policies, including National Grid and Centrica, but two closed up on the day and none of the others fell by more than 1%.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a pretty modest response\u2014if you didn\u2019t know there was an election this morning and just saw the share prices, you probably wouldn\u2019t infer it,\u201d said Matthew Jennings, investment director for U.K. equities at Fidelity International.\u201cThere are many more important things to think about when you buy these companies than politics,\u201d he added.Larry Hatheway,        portfolio manager at GAM Holdings said it was too early for Mr. Corbyn to be impacting share prices. The U.K. election, as whole, left investors pondering a host of variables and potential outcomes.\u201cWe watch these things, but I think right now the market sees it as political rhetoric rather than economic reality,\u201d Mr. Hatheway said. \u201cIf it does become reality then markets will react.\u201dWrite to Mike Bird at Mike.Bird@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Investors Takes New Look at Labour.'", "news_time": "2017-06-11 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-ask-what-labours-showing-means-for-british-investments-1497173401", "news_title": "Investors Contemplate the Corbyn Effect", "keywords": "brexit,british pound,immigration,jeremy corbyn,labour party,london shares,nationalization,royal bank of scotland,royal mail,sterling,taxes,uk election,Royal Bank of Scotland Group,UK:RBS,National Grid,UK:NG.,Centrica,UK:CNA,Jeremy Corbyn,David Docherty,Matthew Jennings,Richard Colwell,economic performance,indicators,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is still in talks with Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party over a deal that would provide her Conservative Party with the necessary votes to govern as a minority administration, her office said early Sunday, despite earlier saying an agreement had been reached.Downing Street didn\u2019t provide an explanation for the shift in tone.The DUP said in a statement that it had held positive discussions with the Conservatives that would continue over the next week.The news follows Thursday\u2019s U.K. national election, in which Mrs. May drew far fewer votes than anticipated and fell short of an overall majority in Parliament. She was forced to seek the help of the DUP\u2014which secured 10 of the 650 seats in Parliament\u2014to form an alliance that would see the small party back the government on critical Parliamentary votes to keep the Conservatives in power.Mrs. May had called the election in April in a bid to strengthen her hand ahead of negotiations with European Union members on the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc, due to start June 19. But the opposite played out.The talks are over a so-called confidence-and-supply deal between the two parties\u2014a rarity in Britain, where the political system tends to deliver simple majority governments. It would mean the DUP would effectively pledge to back the government in any future no-confidence motions in Parliament and to support its tax-and-spending plans, delivered in twice-yearly budgets debated by lawmakers. Governments in the U.K. must win such votes to stay in office.It would fall short of a formal coalition, meaning Mrs. May would have to fight for Parliamentary support for the bulk of her legislative platform.On Saturday, Mrs. May\u2019s two closest aides, joint chiefs of staff Nick Timothy and       Fiona Hill,        resigned in the wake of Thursday\u2019s election result.\u201cClearly, the general election result was a huge disappointment,\u201d Mr. Timothy said in a letter on the political website Conservative Home. He called Britain a divided country but said Mrs. May is \u201cthe one political leader who understands this.\u201dThe weaker-than-expected result for Mrs. May could prompt her to pursue a softer Brexit path than she had hoped. Ahead of the election, she was unequivocal on her plans to pull Britain out of the EU\u2019s single market and customs union, which require free movement of people from the bloc\u2014a key demand of many supporters of Brexit.But that now appears to be in question.EU officials said the political uncertainty brought about by the U.K. election wouldn\u2019t affect the two-year timetable for Britain and the EU to negotiate an exit.German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       on Friday said she didn\u2019t expect any delay in the divorce negotiation.\u201cWe said that, of course, we will wait until after the election in Great Britain,\u201d Ms. Merkel said Friday evening during a visit to Mexico. \u201cBut these talks will begin in the next days.\u201dMs. Merkel said she and the leaders of the other 26 counties committed to remaining in the bloc want to negotiate Brexit \u201cbriskly\u201d and \u201cwithin the timetable.\u201d\u201cWe want to remain a good partner of Great Britain,\u201d Ms. Merkel added.Mrs. May faced criticism from within her Conservative Party on Friday after a campaign that was dogged by missteps, including a key policy reversal.\u201cOur own campaign was hijacked by ourselves,\u201d Conservative lawmaker       Nigel Evans       told the British Broadcasting Corp. \u201cIt was an amazing own goal. We didn\u2019t shoot ourselves in the foot. We shot ourselves in the head.\u201dShe also faced criticism over her decision to pursue an alliance with the DUP, which has a socially conservative approach to issues including gay marriage and abortion.The key positions in Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet were unaffected by the election, with       Philip Hammond       staying on as Treasury chief and       Boris Johnson       remaining foreign secretary.U.S. President       Donald Trump       called Mrs. May to offer his congratulations on her election victory, a U.K. government spokesperson said late Friday. Both sides agreed that they look forward to continuing their close cooperation, the spokesperson said.Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-11 02:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-leader-loses-key-aides-after-poll-setback-1497100701", "news_title": "U.K. Prime Minister\u2019s Office Says DUP Deal Not Yet Done", "keywords": " chiefs of staff, coalition government, conservative party, dup, hung parliament,northern ireland, theresa may,uk election,U.K. government,Democratic Unionist Party,Conservative Party,Theresa May,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections"}]
