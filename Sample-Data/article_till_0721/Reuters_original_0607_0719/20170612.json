The proposed reappointments for the six-member board include Chairman Shigehisa Takada. The Takada family commands a stake of around 60 percent in the auto parts maker, which is facing bankruptcy over the crisis.  The target of widespread criticism over the firm's handling of the multi-billion dollar recall, Takada had said at last year's shareholders' meeting that he would resign after a  new management regime  was found. In a letter to shareholders on Monday, the company said  Takada had been nominated for reappointment as he needs to finish important management issues such as recall measures and work relating to the firm's business revival plans. U.S. auto components maker Key Safety Systems (KSS) and partner private equity firm Bain Capital are the frontrunners among potential suitors. They are seeking to strike a rescue deal worth around 200 billion yen with Takata's steering committee and its automaker customers. Talks have dragged on since February 2016 as potential bidders try to identify and ring-fence Takata's liabilities. Takata's airbag inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. They have been blamed for at least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide.

The intensive raids and bombing strikes mainly pounded the southern part of Deraa, strategically located on the border with Jordan and where the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad erupted six years ago.  The Syrian army has recently intensified dropping barrel bombs, drums or cylinders packed with shrapnel, and has fired hundreds of so-called elephant rockets on Deraa's old quarter and a former refugee camp nearby, rebels and residents said. The army has not commented on its troop build-up in Deraa or the escalating aerial bombing. State media has long branded the rebels as foreign-backed  terrorists .     More reinforcements from the army and its allies, the Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah and Shi'ite Muslim Iraqi militias, are also being rushed to the city from several locations near the capital, Damascus. Troops were using the Damascus-Deraa highway, a major supply route where well-fortified trenches on both sides of the road have made it more difficult for rebels to mount attacks.  The regime has brought large columns of troops from the elite 4th Armoured Division, and also Hezbollah forces,  said Major Issam al Rayes, spokesman of the so-called Southern Front grouping of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels, who are supported by an Arab-Western coalition. The troops being sent as reinforcements are considered to be the Syrian army's elite division, which has the best training and equipment. Rebels say the troop build-up and relentless aerial bombing in recent weeks pointed to a major campaign for what the FSA rebels see as a decisive battle.  Everything indicates the regime is preparing for a large-scale military campaign in Deraa in which they plan to encircle the city and reach the Jordanian border,  Rayes said. Adham al-Karad, the commander of the missile brigade in the FSA's Southern Front, said:  Our surveillance shows troop carriers and heavy armor ... if it continues at this same level of reinforcements, this will be very large.  The army had stepped up its campaign to regain the Manshiya neighborhood, a strategic district that almost completely fell into rebel hands after four months of street battles. Rebels stormed Manshiya, the last army foothold in Deraa's rebel-held old quarter, in February to ward off any army attempt to capture a strategic crossing with Jordan. The army's control of the crossing, a once-thriving passenger and commercial gateway with Jordan, would sever the rebel link between the eastern and western parts of the province they control, dealing a major blow to their cause in the south. The Syrian government's strategic goal is to open a direct route from Damascus to the Jordanian border.

With more than half the year still to go, US dollar offerings from non-financial issuers this year have reached $8.76 billion, ahead of 2013's annual record of $7.95 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data for Asia Pacific, including Australia but excluding Japan. Power Construction Corporation of China, which printed a $500 million perpetual non-call five note, and Sinochem-backed Far East Horizon, which sold $300 million of perpetual non-call five notes, joined the fray last week, becoming the latest corporate issuers to take advantage of strong market conditions. Financial issuers have also been active, with insurance provider FWD selling $500 million of zero-coupon perpetual non-call five bonds and asset manager and boutique investment bank AMTD Group printing $200 million of perpetual non-call three notes on Thursday. The rush of deals shows investors are willing to take on duration risk in return for higher returns. “Some issuers’ senior debt may be too tight for a lot of people, so they can either go down the credit spectrum or go down the capital structure to get more yield,” said Jake Gearhart, head of debt syndicate and origination for Asia Pacific at Deutsche Bank. Perpetual bonds may be treated as equity for accounting purposes, helping companies to keep their gearing low. “A lot of Asian issuers are more reliant on bank debt than capital markets, so that flexibility is valuable to them,” said Gearhart. Some market participants complained that perps, especially those with a yield that is fixed for life, are sold mainly to private wealth investors, who may buy them on leverage to amplify returns. However, institutional investors have been supporting the recent flow of deals, too. Neeraj Seth, head of Asian credit at BlackRock, said he was  selectively positive  on perpetuals, but warned that investors needed to examine both the credit and the structure of undated bonds.  A lot of times these bonds get sold by the name of the issuer and the headline yield of the bond,  said Seth. After initial enthusiasm for perps earlier this year, there was a slight sell-off last month, as investors complained of over-supply. Nan Fung Group's perp non-call three bonds traded down half a point on May 23, their first day of trading, while even hugely oversubscribed deals like Cheung Kong Property's perp dipped below reoffer. The slump was thought to be due in part to the weight of issuance hitting the market this year. Rate Views Perpetual bonds are sensitive to rising interest rates, and their rising popularity suggests investors are unconcerned about further US rate increases later this year. Unusually, the flood of perpetual offerings has coincided with a spike in the number of Asian offshore floating-rate bond issues - two conflicting trends. “Perps are booming, but floaters are booming too,” said Deutsche's Gearhart. “That shows there is a divided view of how the market is going. Step-up perp buyers and FRN buyers are in the same camp, but fixed-for-life buyers are more focused on rates not going up too much.” Despite the huge supply of perps, appetite has been so strong that the premium they offer over dated senior bonds has narrowed.  I would say the spreads between corporate perpetual and senior bonds are slightly shrinking, but it depends on the structure,  said Annisa Lee, head of Asia ex-Japan flow credit analysis at Nomura.  The multiple could be 1.2x or 1.3x for senior perp with high step-up - one cannot compare a fixed-for-life perp by Company A to a senior perp with a high step-up issued by Company B. But the multiple (versus senior bonds) for fixed-for-life is lower compared to previous deals.  Fixed-for-life structures, which lack the usual step-up if not called, and therefore give issuers less incentive to redeem, have also grown in popularity this year, with seven such deals, totalling $4.0 billion, all from issuers in Greater China. Investors have tended to assume that Asian issuers will call their perps at the first opportunity. However, issuers are not punished with higher coupon payments if they do not redeem fixed-for-life notes at the call date, and some structures allow them to defer coupon payments indefinitely. While such structures have continued to find healthy demand this year as investors hunt for yield, not everyone is a fan.  Senior step-up perps are okay,  said a fund manager.  Fixed-for-life perps are f***ed up.  (Reporting by Daniel Stanton; Editing by Steve Garton)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/asia-debt-bonds-idUSL3N1J91I8"},

The Reserve Bank of India last Wednesday brought the Masala bond market in line with existing rules on external commercial borrowings in other currencies. As a result, Masala bonds must have a minimum original maturity of three years, rising to at least five years for deals over $50 million, and coupon rates must be no more than 300 basis points over the government curve. The changes temper earlier efforts to stimulate the growth of the offshore rupee market, which allows Indian companies to borrow overseas without taking currency risk, and have not gone down well with market participants.  The central bank is clipping the wings when the market was just starting to take off,  said a fixed income trader from a foreign bank. In the past three months, Housing Development Finance Corporation, National Highways Authority of India and power generation company NTPC have all sold Masala bonds, raising interest in the format. While NHAI and NTPC sold five-year debt, the three-year tenor has been popular for non-banking finance companies such as HDFC, Shriram Transport Finance and Indiabulls Housing Finance. Retrograde Step  The new guidelines will affect the plans for housing finance companies which were keen on raising Masala bonds above $50 million for three years,  said another DCM banker. Most bankers feel the move will stall a market that was already struggling to gain traction.  It is a retrograde step for sure; it will kill the Masala market further,  said an executive director from a foreign bank.  It will de facto rule out credit (corporate) borrowers, non-sovereign and non-quasi-sovereign issuers.  The RBI said that the all-in-cost ceiling for Masala bonds will be set at 300bp over the prevailing yield of the government securities of corresponding maturity, in line with ECB rules. None of the major Masala offerings have yet crossed that threshold, but some smaller private placements had offered higher yields, according to two DCM bankers. RBI said that the Foreign Exchange Department will examine all proposed Masala issues in future. The central bank also said that investors should not be related to the issuer, raising questions over some innovative structures that had allowed Indian companies to access the global high-yield bond market. For example, ReNew Power Ventures in February sold Masala bonds to a Mauritius-based funding vehicle, Neerg Energy, which used the notes as collateral for a $475 million offshore bond. However, not all agree that the new RBI guidelines will have a negative impact on the Masala market. “There has been a decent appetite, and good issuers will continue to tap the market,” said Ajay Manglunia, head of fixed income at Edelweiss Capital. “Masala bonds will be well received for the five-year maturity as well.” (Reporting by Krishna Merchant; Editing by Steve Garton and Daniel Stanton)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/india-debt-bonds-idUSL3N1J91GR"},

The Nikkei dropped 0.8 percent to 19,848.60 in midmorning trade. Semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers and Apple suppliers led the declines, with Tokyo Electron tumbling 3.5 percent, Advantest Corp dropping 3.4 percent, TDK Corp shedding 3.0 percent and Taiyo Yuden declining 3.1 percent. On Friday, Apple Inc shares fell 3.9 percent in their biggest daily percentage decline since April 2016 after a report that iPhones to be launched later this year will use modem chips with slower download speeds than some rival smartphones.  Since Japanese tech shares had chased strong performances on the Nasdaq, they will likely see a correction for now,  said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities. Meanwhile, a key focus for markets this week is the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting that ends on Wednesday in which it is expected to raise interest rates. Investors will focus on any fresh hints on the pace of further tightening in the near term and also next year, and any details on its plans to trim its balance sheet.

MORENA party members will have to ratify Lopez Obrador's recommendation. Lopez Obrador, a divisive figure with nationalist leanings who has led a number of early polls for the 2018 presidential vote, added that he would not align MORENA with the smaller Green, Citizens Movement, New Alliance and Encuentro Social parties.

Young teenagers wearing face masks and throwing rocks are a common sight at anti-government protests that have roiled the capital, Caracas, since April. At least six of the 67 people killed in the protests were under 18. Maduro said opposition parties were  training children for terrorist groups,  using his preferred terminology for the protesters he says are intent on overthrowing the government of the oil-producing nation.   I am going to ask Pope Francis to help us so the opposition end the violence, but more than anything to stop looking for children to involve in violent acts,  he said on a weekly television broadcast. Demanding that delayed elections be held and angry at shortages of food and medicine, thousands of mostly peaceful protesters have been on the streets since April. Smaller groups throwing rocks and petrol bombs have been met with tear gas grenades, water cannons and other riot-control methods. Both sides have turned to the Vatican to mediate a solution, but church-mediated talks late last year quickly broke down in acrimony.  Relations with Venezuela's Catholic hierarchy and the government have become increasingly strained this year, with a spate of violent incidents at churches and other religious institutions.  Venezuela's bishops' conference delivered a letter on Thursday to the pope that accused the government of being a dictatorship.  The bishops also sided with the opposition view that Maduro's plan for a new legislative body charged with rewriting the constitution after elections on July 30 is a plot aimed at changing the rules of the game to consolidate power.  Maduro says the new constitution will resolve the political crisis.  Human rights groups have criticized the government's response to the protests, saying its  excessive use of force  and militarization have escalated the violence, while government officials say the world is turning a blind eye to opposition brutality including shootings of security officials and some burnings of people. Opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, who has been held in a military prison for three years, called on Venezuelan soldiers on Sunday to rebel to enforce the constitution and oppose government orders to act against protesters.  You have the right and duty to rebel,  he said in a video posted on Twitter apparently recorded in his prison cell.  Another opposition leader, Henrique Capriles, said recently that 150 armored vehicles bought from Chinese defense conglomerate China North Industries Group Corp, or Norinco, had arrived at Venezuela's Puerto Cabello and were expected to be quickly transported to Caracas for what he called  repression.   A document seen by Reuters on Sunday showed that Norinco recently shipped 165 vehicles to Venezuela. It did not say what type of vehicles. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the document. Norinco was not immediately available for comment outside Chinese office hours. The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Reporting by Eyanir Chinea and Girish Gupta; Editing by Peter Cooney","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKBN19304Y"},

The Converse shoes were said to be used by the NBA legend in the gold medal game against Spain in the 1984 Olympics, according to ESPN.  The record-shattering price proves that Michael Jordan has no equal in the marketplace for game-used basketball memorabilia,  said Dan Imler, vice president of SCP Auctions, which sold the shoes. Jordan's shoes from the 1984 Olympics -- the game was played at The Forum in Inglewood, a suburb of Los Angeles -- are autographed and include his orthotic inserts. They are considered the last pair Jordan wore in a game as an amateur and also the last time he wore Converse in an official game. Jordan scored 20 points in the 96-65 win over Spain on Aug. 10, 1984. He was drafted by the Chicago Bulls three weeks before he played his first game for the United States in the 1984 Games and signed his deal with the Bulls in September, followed by a Nike deal in October 1984. According to ESPN, the previous record for a pair of game-used sneakers sold at auction was for the ones Jordan wore in Game Five of the 1997 NBA Finals, also known as the  Flu Game.  Those sneakers sold for $104,765 in 2013. That game was played 20 years ago Sunday, with Jordan battling through flu-like symptoms to score 38 points in the Bulls' win over the Jazz.

The 3.1 percent fall in the core orders from a month earlier was much bigger than the 1.3 percent decline expected by economists in a Reuters poll, potentially dragging on economic growth in the current quarter. It also marked the first drop in three months, following a 1.4 percent increase in March, the Cabinet Office data showed. Though the machinery order data, which excludes ships and orders from the electric power utilities, is highly volatile, it is regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months. The reading follows a surprisingly sharp downward revision to first-quarter economic growth, as a reduction in inventories put annualized growth at 1.0 percent, much slower than the initially estimated 2.2 percent. More recently, a run of indicators and business activity surveys have pointed to still solid exports and factory output, although wage growth and household spending remain stubbornly sluggish despite a tightening job market. Policymakers are hoping that Japanese firms will tap their hefty profits to spur investment and boost wages to stoke a  sustainable growth cycle.  Capital expenditure will likely remain lackluster in the current quarter,  said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.  Exports and factory output are performing well on the back of global economic recovery and a weak yen, but uncertainty over U.S. President (Donald) Trump's trade policy makes Japanese firms hesitant about domestic investment.  By sector, core orders from manufacturers rose 2.5 percent in April, up for a third straight month. The gains were led by orders from electrical machinery companies for semiconductor production equipment and computers, and all-purpose industrial machinery firms. Orders from the services sector fell 5.0 percent, dragged down by orders from financial and insurance firms for computer systems, down for a second consecutive month.  The 3.1 percent may appear a big drop, but overall core orders held firm, centering on manufacturers,  said a senior Cabinet Office official. Orders from manufacturers would have logged a double-digit gain if a one-off pullback in orders from nonferrous metal firms for nuclear-powered motors was excluded. Orders from abroad, which were not counted as core orders, jumped 17.4 percent in April, up for the first time in three months. The Cabinet Office stuck to its assessment of machinery orders, saying the pick-up was stalling, using the same assessment for an eighth straight month. Still, the Bank of Japan is set to upgrade its economic assessment as early as this week to signal its growing conviction the recovery is gathering momentum, people familiar with its thinking told Reuters last week. Such an upgrade would reinforce expectations that the BOJ's next move would be to tighten monetary policy, though analysts do not expect it will begin to do so anytime soon.

Gas shortages are increasingly hitting households during the chilly winter months, often when people are trying to prepare dinner or need to heat their homes in the evenings. “What else can one do other than burning fuelwood, when one does not get gas supplied at his home?” grumbled Muhammad Razzaq, a 50-year-old government employee, as he recently collected a load of firewood. Last winter, he said, he needed to buy firewood for cooking and heating water for bathing and dishwashing when no gas was available at his rented home on the outskirts of Islamabad. Summer temperatures have now reduced the need for heating, but environmentalists worry that worsening gas shortages are fueling a new surge of deforestation in the country – and could derail ambitious efforts to plant trees and reverse the country’s large-scale forest losses. “We and our environment will be completely deprived of the environmental and health gains of these afforestation programs by 2030,  said Riffat Naseem Malik of the Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management at the University of Haripur in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, which is working to replant a billion new trees  People will be chopping down these trees even more rapidly to meet their domestic energy needs as long as the government fails to stave off the huge gas supply shortfall,” he said. Turn on the Gas Gas consumption in Pakistan has grown by more than 80 percent over the last 20 years. As the country’s population grows rapidly, the number of domestic gas connections has more than doubled, from around 4 million to 8.4 million, according to the Pakistan Economic Survey 2016-17. Although the government reports that just under 30 percent of households have access to gas, the state-owned Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority estimates domestic gas demand to be 5.8 billion cubic feet per day, compared to production of around 4.1 billion cubic feet – a shortfall of 1.7 billion cubic feet. The authority warned in April this year that by 2030 the gap will rise to as much as 3.9 billion cubic feet per day. The country is unable to meet demand in part because of inadequate investment in gas exploration in Pakistan, due in part to the country’s poor security situation. But experts point to other factors behind the gas shortfall as well, including inadequate maintenance of existing gas pipeline networks, the diversion of large quantities of gas from supplying households to fuelling power plants in order to cut oil import expenses, and a steep rise in the conversion of vehicles to compressed natural gas as a cheap fuel source. Mukhtar Ahmed, a former energy adviser to the prime minister, estimates that by 2030 Pakistan’s overall demand for energy will increase 350 percent, while the proportion of the country’s total energy needs met from domestic sources will fall from 72 percent to 38 percent. Less Gas, Fewer Trees? The gas shortfall has alarmed forest and environment experts in a country where 27,000 hectares (67,000 acres) of forest are chopped down each year, according to the government’s National Forest Policy, published in 2015. A report by the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization says that deforestation has averaged 42,000 hectares annually since 1990, reducing the country’s forested area by more than 40 percent between 1990 and 2015. Forests now cover less than 2 percent of Pakistan’s land area, one of the lowest levels in the region, the report said. Conservationists fear worsening gas shortages could reverse recent forest gains from projects such as the ambitious Billion Tree Tsunami project in the northwest province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and the prime minister’s Green Pakistan Program, which aims to plant 100 million trees nationally over a five-year period. The architect of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa project, Malik Amin Aslam, said that the provincial government is working on plans to reduce people’s reliance on fuel wood. Solar and Hydropower Push The province is supporting the installation of more than 350 community-based micro-hydropower projects, at a cost of 5 billion Pakistani rupees ($48 million), to electrify millions of off-grid rural households, he said.  The small hydropower plants will generate 35 megawatts of electricity, he said. “The project is already 70 percent completed and, in fact, the ambition has recently been expanded to take it to 1,000 micro-hydro units by 2018. As these remote locations are close to or in the middle of pristine natural forests, this provides a carbon-free alternative to cutting trees,” Amin Aslam said. Solar energy projects similarly are being put in place to reduce the need for fuel wood, he said, including a plan to provide solar cooking stoves and water heaters in the forest areas around Chitral district. The aim, he said, is that “the trees being planted today in the province will remain intact, as by the time they grow fully mature people will have solar-powered and electricity-run efficient domestic stoves in their kitchens and rooms for cooking and health as well as solar and electric geysers in their bathrooms for bathing in winter”. With domestic oil and gas supplies forecast to be exhausted by 2025 and 2030 respectively, according a report by the U.S.-based National Bureau of Asian Research, the Pakistani government has also expedited efforts to import gas. The federal minister for petroleum and natural resources, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, said work had begun to fast-track gas import projects, including the Iran-Pakistan pipeline, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline and the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In February the government signed a 15-year agreement with Qatar to import up to 3.75 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year. “Pakistan is well on track to have 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of LNG in the system by end of 2017, which will halve the country’s current total gas shortfall,” Abbasi said in an interview.

The 3.1 percent fall in the core orders from a month earlier was much bigger than the 1.3 percent decline expected by economists in a Reuters poll, potentially dragging on economic growth in the current quarter. It also marked the first drop in three months, following a 1.4 percent increase in March, the Cabinet Office data showed. Though the machinery order data, which excludes ships and orders from the electric power utilities, is highly volatile, it is regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months. The reading follows a surprisingly sharp downward revision to first-quarter economic growth, as a reduction in inventories put annualized growth at 1.0 percent, much slower than the initially estimated 2.2 percent. More recently, a run of indicators and business activity surveys have pointed to still solid exports and factory output, although wage growth and household spending remain stubbornly sluggish despite a tightening job market. Policymakers are hoping that Japanese firms will tap their hefty profits to spur investment and boost wages to stoke a  sustainable growth cycle.  Capital expenditure will likely remain lackluster in the current quarter,  said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.  Exports and factory output are performing well on the back of global economic recovery and a weak yen, but uncertainty over U.S. President (Donald) Trump's trade policy makes Japanese firms hesitant about domestic investment.  By sector, core orders from manufacturers rose 2.5 percent in April, up for a third straight month. The gains were led by orders from electrical machinery companies for semiconductor production equipment and computers, and all-purpose industrial machinery firms. Orders from the services sector fell 5.0 percent, dragged down by orders from financial and insurance firms for computer systems, down for a second consecutive month.  The 3.1 percent may appear a big drop, but overall core orders held firm, centering on manufacturers,  said a senior Cabinet Office official. Orders from manufacturers would have logged a double-digit gain if a one-off pullback in orders from nonferrous metal firms for nuclear-powered motors was excluded. Orders from abroad, which were not counted as core orders, jumped 17.4 percent in April, up for the first time in three months. The Cabinet Office stuck to its assessment of machinery orders, saying the pick-up was stalling, using the same assessment for an eighth straight month. Still, the Bank of Japan is set to upgrade its economic assessment as early as this week to signal its growing conviction the recovery is gathering momentum, people familiar with its thinking told Reuters last week. Such an upgrade would reinforce expectations that the BOJ's next move would be to tighten monetary policy, though analysts do not expect it will begin to do so anytime soon.

Now another such difficult-to-defeat duo is emerging in Arizona: Greinke and Robbie Ray. Ray outdueled Chase Anderson in a matchup of two of the majors' hottest pitchers before Arizona's long-ball offense put away its latest home victory, an 11-1 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Sunday. The Diamondbacks hit four homers against the Milwaukee bullpen while scoring five runs in both the seventh and eighth innings as they took two of three in the weekend series. Brandon Drury, Chris Herrmann and David Peralta homered during a five-run seventh inning against relievers Carlos Torres and Neftali Feliz. Paul Goldschmidt's grand slam in the eighth against Rob Scahill helped secure what for six innings was a tightly played game. The surprising Diamondbacks won for the 11th time in their past 12 games at Chase Field, where they are 26-9 this season. They have won five of six overall.  All of my pitches were working ... and the bats came alive at the end there. That was impressive,  Ray said. Related CoverageArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchSo was the starting pitcher. Ray (7-3) struck out 12, gave up three hits and walked four over 6 2/3 scoreless innings. He won his fifth start in a row, a streak in which he has allowed only one run in 37 innings (0.24 ERA). The left-hander is the first Arizona pitcher since Randy Johnson in 2004 to strike out at least 10 in three consecutive starts, and he is doing it in Johnson-like fashion with an overpowering-at-times fastball and an assortment of breaking pitches. Match that with Greinke's current streak of seven wins in his past eight decisions, and the Diamondbacks are becoming one of the few staffs with two certifiable aces.  It's been great, we're feeding off each other,  Ray said.  It's just (trying) to outdo the next guy. If a guy goes seven innings, you want to go eight. If a guy punches out 10, you want to punch out 12. It's a good healthy competition.  Following a stretch of six strikeouts in a span of seven batters, Ray was lifted after hitting Orlando Arcia with a pitch and walking pinch hitter Jesus Aguilar with two outs in the seventh. Reliever J.J. Hoover then walked Lewis Brinson, who played in his first major league game, to load the bases, but Jorge De La Rosa came on to strike out Eric Thames on three pitches to end the threat. Thames is 1-for-24 against Arizona this season. Drury, whose two-run homer carried the D-backs to a 3-2 victory Saturday night, then greeted Torres in the bottom of the seventh with his seventh homer -- a drive into the swimming pool in right field. After Daniel Descalso singled, Herrmann -- who is becoming Ray's designated catcher -- hit a drive over the right field wall for his sixth homer, just after a similar drive to left went foul at the last instant. Feliz came on with two outs and walked Gregor Blanco before Peralta homered off the right field foul pole on a 2-2 pitch, his fifth homer of the season. The Diamondbacks have an NL-leading 58 homers at home, where they have homered in 15 consecutive games.  We scored a bunch of runs the last three innings, and that's what we've been doing,  Peralta said. Goldschmidt said that, all season, the D-backs' pitching has picked up the offense,  And we've been able to have some big innings. Guys are confident, but we know there's a long way to go.  Anderson (5-2) was nearly as effective as Ray, giving up one run on four hits and a walk while striking out eight over six innings, but the former Diamondbacks right-hander saw his three-game winning streak stopped. The game really got out of hand after the bullpen came on, with four Brewers relievers combining to allow 10 runs and nine hits over Arizona's last two offensive innings.  We've got more than one guy who is struggling right now, but they've got to pitch,  Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said.  The only way to get untracked is to pitch, and they've got to figure it out. Making changes certainly is an option, but we're limited there.  Anderson's run of 21 consecutive scoreless innings also was halted, and quickly, as Peralta singled ahead of Goldschmidt's one-out double down the left field line in the first. Jake Lamb, who leads the majors with 57 RBIs, scored Peralta with a grounder to short that deflected off Anderson.  I tried to keep the game close ...(and) it was a pitchers' duel,  Anderson said.  (But) that one run was the difference there, and they just opened it up in the seventh, which was unfortunate.  Milwaukee didn't score until Keon Broxton homered in the ninth off Silvino Bracho. NOTES: Arizona 1B Paul Goldschmidt's grand slam was the fourth of his career and his 14th homer of the season. Goldschmidt has reached base in 38 consecutive home games, a franchise record.... Diamondbacks LHP Robbie Ray has nine career games with at least 10 strikeouts, including five in 13 starts this season. ... Arizona RHP Zack Greinke was reinstated from the paternity list and RHP Tom Wilhelmsen was designated for assignment, a move that manager Torey Lovullo said was extremely difficult to make because of how valuable the 33-year-old has been to the younger Diamondbacks relievers. ... Brewers RHP Jimmy Nelson, who starts Tuesday against St. Louis, is 0-8 in his career against the Cardinals. ... Brewers OF Lewis Brinson, considered the team's top prospect, made his major league debut by going 0-for-2 with two walks and a stolen base. He was robbed of a base hit by Arizona SS Nick Ahmed's diving stop of a hard-hit grounder in the first inning.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-diamondbacks-brewers-writethru-idUSMTZED6CEQWKUT"},

Mike Moustakas hit two, driving in four runs. Eric Hosmer hit his second in as many games for two of his three RBIs. Alex Gordon added a solo shot. Seven of the Royals' runs in the 8-3, rubber-match victory over the Padres came on home runs. Kansas City hit 10 home runs in the three-game, interleague set to account for 18 of its 23 runs. Even so, the first player Royals manager Ned Yost acknowledged in his postgame analysis was rookie starting pitcher Jake Junis, who got the win.  Jake gave us exactly what we needed,  said Yost.  It was exactly what the doctor ordered, seven innings from Jake and an off day tomorrow. The offense gave us a big lead, and Junis pitched on the attack. He executed pitches and had a really good slider.  He held the fort for us.  Related CoverageKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchAlthough Junis and Padres starter Dinelson Lamet each surrendered three homers, Junis carried the matchup of rookie right-handers. Junis (2-0) allowed three runs on six hits and a walk with six strikeouts in seven-plus innings. Cory Spangenberg hit two of the three homers off Junis, who departed after Jose Pirela opened the eighth with a homer. Lamet (2-2) allowed seven runs on six hits and a walk in five innings. He struck out six. After going 2-0 with a 2.70 ERA in his first two starts, Lamet is 0-2 and has allowed 16 runs (14 earned) on 11 hits and six walks over eight innings in his two most recent outings. The Royals, who belted five home runs Saturday, resumed their homer barrage in the first inning Sunday. Moustakas connected on a three-run blast that capped a four-run burst, accentuating another recent San Diego problem. Lamet retired the first two hitters he faced ... then found himself down 4-0 before he got out of the first. It marked the fifth time in five games that a Padres pitcher retired the first two hitters in an inning before multiple runs were scored ahead of the final out. Lorenzo Cain drew a two-out walk in the first, and he advanced to third on two wild pitches before scoring on a Hosmer single. Salvador Perez followed with a single ahead of Moustakas' 405-foot drive into the right field seats.  Lamet struggled with his command,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  When you can't command your fastball, it's tough to pitch in this league. And he struggled out of the stretch.  Moustakas hit his second homer of the game -- and 17th of the season -- off left-handed reliever Jose Torres in the ninth. It was the third baseman's fifth multi-homer game of his career and first of the season.  Moose is really locked in,  Yost said.  He is really putting together a great season this year power-wise. He is really seeing the ball well and driving it to all fields with power.  Moustakas said,  I'm still missing mistakes. I've been fortunate this year that things are going out of the park. It's been pretty good to this point.  Spangenberg's first homer cut the Royals' lead to 5-1. The second came when the Royals led 7-1. Pirela's drive into the left field seats leading off the eighth -- making him 11-for-22 with three doubles, two homers and five RBIs since he was promoted from Triple-A El Paso last Tuesday -- ended Junis' third major league start.  I knew the bullpen had been getting used a little,  Junis said.  I wanted to give them a break going into the off day. I felt my off-speed was a little sharper today and I was locating my fastball better. I was getting ahead and staying ahead.  NOTES: Royals C Salvador Perez departed in the fifth inning due to tightness on the left side of his rib cage. It is not considered a serious injury.  He just took a swing and felt a little tightness,  manager Ned Yost said of Perez.  We're not taking any chances with him.  ... The Padres promoted RHP Phil Maton from Triple-A El Paso, and he debuted with a 1-2-3 inning. Maton had a 2.84 ERA in Triple-A and was tied for the Pacific Coast League lead in saves with 13. ...

Brent crude futures were trading at $48.44 per barrel at 0101 GMT, up 29 cents, or 0.6, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $46.09 per barrel, up 26 cents, or 0.6 percent. Traders said that the price rises came on the back of speculative traders upping their investment into crude futures, by taking on large volumes of long positions, which would profit from a further price rise. The rise in new long positions comes after Brent and WTI crude futures have fallen by around 10 percent below their opening levels on May 25, when an OPEC-led policy to cut oil output was extended to cover the first quarter of 2018 instead of expiring this June. While the financial market seems to have some confidence that prices may have bottomed out, the physical market remains bloated, especially due to a rise in U.S. drilling for new oil production. U.S. energy firms added eight oil rigs in the week to June 9, bringing the total count up to 741, the most since April 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N said on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI This ongoing drive to find new oil has driven up U.S. output by more than 10 percent since mid-2016, to over 9.3 million bpd, a figure the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) says will likely rise above 10 million bpd by next year, challenging top exporter Saudi Arabia. Soaring U.S. output threatens to undermine an effort led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut almost 1.8 million bpd of production until the first quarter of 2018 in order to tighten markets and prop up prices.

Chanting against  ruling mafia  and carrying portraits of detained activists, protesters packed Rabat's Bab El Hed area and marched toward the parliament, with most from the Adl Wal Ihsan (Justice and Spirituality) Islamist movement. Political unrest is rare in the North African kingdom but protests around northern city Al-Hoceima since October have been the largest since the 2011  Arab Spring -inspired rallies that prompted the king to cede some powers. The participation of Justice and Spirituality is significant. A major player in the 2011 protests, the movement is banned from formal politics, but is the only opposition group able to mobilize on a massive scale.  We came out to protest about the social reality in Morocco,  said Lamia, a school teacher who came from the northern city of Tetouan to the Rabat rally.  We're here in solidarity with Al-Hoceima, to demand dignity.  Police estimated the rally was more than 10,000 strong, though Justice and Spirituality said it was much larger. It was the most significant political rally in Rabat since the 2011 unrest and smaller leftist groups and labor unions, as well as some parliamentary opposition parties, also participated.

Some of the anger in the Al-Hoceima protests has been directed at  Makhzen , the royal governing establishment, but the unrest has not been aimed at the king. Morocco has a deeply rooted monarchy, the Muslim world's longest-serving dynasty. But tensions in Al-Hoceima and the Rif region, long a hotbed of anti-government dissent, have been rising since the arrest of the protest movement's leader Nasser Zefzafi on charges of threatening national security.  The unrest is testing nerves in a kingdom that presents itself as a model for stability and gradual reform, as well as a safe haven for foreign investment in a region affected by militant violence.

Aldi operates 1,600 U.S. stores and earlier this year said it would add another 400 by the end of 2018 and spend $1.6 billion to remodel 1,300 of them. The investment, which raises Aldi's capital expenditure to at least $5 billion so far this year, comes at a time of intense competition and disruption in the industry. German rival Lidl will open the first of its 100 U.S. stores on June 15. In May, Lidl said it would price products up to 50 percent lower than rivals. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the largest U.S. grocer, is testing lower prices in 11 U.S. states and pushing vendors to undercut rivals by 15 percent. Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader, analysts said. A sign directing shoppers to an ALDI Sued grocery store in Unterhaching, Germany May 18, 2017.Michael DalderThe furious pace of expansion by Aldi and Lidl is likely to further disrupt the U.S. grocery market, which has seen 18 bankruptcies since 2014. The two chains are also upending established UK grocers like Tesco Plc (TSCO.L) and Wal-Mart's UK arm, ASDA. In May, Aldi Chief Executive Jason Hart told Reuters the chain intended to have prices at least 21 percent lower than rivals and would focus on adding in-house brands to win over price-sensitive customers.    We're growing at a time when other retailers are struggling,  Hart said in a statement. Hart added that Aldi's prices were also up to 50 percent lower than traditional grocery chains, a move that appeared to follow rival Lidl's announcement on prices. The latest store expansion will create 25,000 U.S. jobs and make Aldi the third-largest grocery chain operator in the country behind Wal-Mart and Kroger Co (KR.N), the German chain said in a statement. Aldi's 2,500 stores would equal about 53 percent of Wal-Mart's U.S. outlets.

Sterling last traded at $1.2743, little changed on the day, after sliding 1.7 percent on Friday, its biggest one-day drop in about eight months. The pound had tumbled by as much as 2.5 percent in the previous session to its lowest since mid-April after no single party won a clear claim to power in the UK election on Thursday -- a result flagged by some analysts as the worst possible election outcome due to uncertainty. May is now trying to unite a disillusioned party around her to not only support her in the Brexit talks but also to strike a deal with a small Northern Irish party that will enable her to stay in power. Negotiations on Britain's exit from the European Union are due to start next Monday.  There is still heightened uncertainty surrounding issues, including how the (British government's) stance toward Brexit talks might change,  said Shinichiro Kadota, senior FX strategist for Barclays in Tokyo.  The lack of moves (in sterling) is more because the market is waiting for fresh information, rather than a sign that it is settling down,  he added. Some market participants say sterling's slump has been tempered by expectations from some investors that the government may pursue a softer stance on Brexit and even increase spending to assuage an austerity-weary electorate. The pound's drop late last week has helped bolster the dollar, which last stood at 97.190 against a basket of six major rivals. The dollar index had risen to as high as 97.500 on Friday, its strongest level since May 30, and up from its June 7 trough of 96.511, which was its lowest level in nearly seven months. A key focus for markets this week is the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting that ends on Wednesday. With the Fed widely expected to raise interest rates, investors' focus will be on any fresh hints on the pace of further tightening in the months to come and next year, and any details on its plans for trimming its balance sheet. The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1207, staying below a seven-month high of $1.1285 set in early June. Projections after the first round of French parliamentary elections on Sunday showed that President Emmanuel Macron's fledgling party is set to trounce France's traditional main parties and secure a huge majority to push through his pro-business reforms. The projections were in line with expectations, and the euro showed little immediate reaction.

Happ the Toronto Blue Jays expected to see this season. The veteran left-hander pitched six scoreless innings to earn his first victory of 2017 as the Blue Jays defeated the Seattle Mariners 4-0 Sunday afternoon at Safeco Field.  He looked like the old guy, really, a jumping fastball and much better command,  Toronto manager John Gibbons said of Happ, who was a 20-game winner last year.  He didn't use a whole lot of other (pitches), he normally doesn't anyways. I think that was a step in the right direction, and it answered a lot of questions for me.  Happ (1-4) spent six weeks on the disabled list this season due to left elbow soreness. The outing at Safeco Field was his third start since returning to action.  I felt more like myself today,  Happ said.  I had more life on my fastball than in the first two outings.  The Mariners put runners in scoring position in each of the first four innings against Happ, but he got out of the jams unscathed. Related CoverageToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch I felt like we had (Happ) on the edge the first couple of innings, but just didn't push him over the edge,  said Mariners manager Scott Servais, whose club went 0-for-10 with runners in scoring position and stranded 11 on base. Happ retired the side in order his final two innings. He allowed six hits, walked one and struck out eight.  A couple of times he got out of the zone, but boom, he was able to make adjustments,  said Blue Jays third baseman Josh Donaldson, who homered and drove in three runs. Six Blue Jays relievers combined for three scoreless innings to complete the shutout, allowing three hits. Roberto Osuna got the final out for his 16th save of the season. Mariners starter James Paxton took his first loss of the year. Paxton (5-1), a left-hander from Ladner, British Columbia, allowed four runs on eight hits in four innings. Paxton was also making his third start since coming off the disabled list, as he was out most of May with a left forearm strain. The Blue Jays got to Paxton in the first inning. Kevin Pillar led off with a double down the left field line, and Donaldson followed with a two-run homer to right field, his eighth of the season. The Blue Jays struck again in the fourth, as Pillar doubled with two outs and Donaldson drove him home with a single to right. Donaldson advanced to second on a walk and scored on Morales' single to left, making it 4-0.  They really grinded through some at-bats to get Paxton's pitch count up,  Servais said.  Donaldson was on him all day, geared up for him.  Seattle got another runner into scoring position in the seventh against the Toronto bullpen, as Ben Gamel led off with a single off Jeff Beliveau and stole second. Ryan Tepera struck out Taylor Motter and pinch hitter Jarrod Dyson, then got Mitch Haniger to fly out to right field to end the inning. Robinson Cano led off the eighth with a single off Aaron Loup. Joe Smith came on to get back-to-back groundouts as Cano advanced to third, and Danny Valencia struck out to end the threat. The Mariners put two runners on in the ninth with two outs, forcing Gibbons to turn to Osuna. The closer got Haniger to fly out to right field to cap the victory. Mariners right-hander Emilio Pagan pitched four hitless innings of relief, allowing one walk and striking out five. NOTES: Mariners RF Mitch Haniger returned after being on the disabled list since April 26 with a strained right oblique. Haniger went 0-for-4 with a walk. To make room on the roster, Seattle optioned OF Boog Powell to Triple-A Tacoma. ... The Blue Jays are off Monday before starting a two-game series Tuesday at home against Tampa Bay.

The contemporary staging of William Shakespeare's tragedy, by the nonprofit Public Theater, portrays Julius Caesar as a blond-haired, powerful man wearing a business suit with an American flag pin, while his wife, Calpurnia, has a Slavic accent and dresses in designer fashions. Shakespeare's play focuses on the fatal stabbing of Caesar by former associates, and the subsequent fate of democratic institutions. Delta said in a statement on Sunday that the Public Theater's  artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste.  In announcing the production in New York's Central Park earlier this year, the Public Theater said the play had  never felt more contemporary,  and described the Roman leader as  magnetic, populist, irreverent, he seems bent on absolute power.  The New York Times review on Friday said the  depiction of a petulant, blondish Caesar in a blue suit, complete with gold bathtub and a pouty Slavic wife, takes onstage Trump-trolling to a startling new level.  The New York Daily News said the production  imagines the Roman ruler as a blond, swaggering, egotist who's a dead ringer for the current occupant of the Oval Office. And he gets murdered for his hubris and hunger for power.  The Public Theater and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday. The play opened May 23 in previews and runs through June 18 with an opening on Monday. It is the first time in 17 years the play has been staged at Central Park's Delacorte Theater. Thousands of people line up every summer for free tickets for Shakespeare in the Park. More than 5 million have attended plays in Manhattan's largest park in the festival's 60-year-history. Other Public Theater sponsors, which include American Express and Bank of America, could not immediately be reached for comment.

ACT for America, a self-described grassroots organization focusing on national security, staged rallies in New York, Chicago, Boston, Denver and Seattle, as well as many smaller cities. Hundreds of people pledged on social media to attend an event that ACT billed as  March against Sharia.  On the steps of the Pennsylvania state capitol in  Harrisburg, barricades and a heavy police presence, including officers mounted on horses, separated about 60 anti-sharia demonstrators from an equal number of counter-protesters. Many of the latter were dressed in black masks and hoods and chanting  No Trump, no KKK, no Fascist USA.   The atmosphere was tense but the protest went off with no violence and only one arrest, police said.  More than a dozen men belonging to the anti-government Oath Keepers were on hand, invited by ACT to provide security. Most of them carried handguns. Chris Achey, 47, of Allentown, Pennsylvania, said he did not hate Muslims but believes that much of Islam is incompatible with Western culture.  The Constitution is the law of the land,  he said.  We have to be careful with who we let in the country.  On its website, ACT described sharia, which covers many aspects of Muslim life including religious obligations and financial dealings, as incompatible with human rights. It said sharia justifies the oppression of women and homosexuality, and advocates female genital mutilation. But critics say the organization vilifies Muslims and has repeatedly equated Islam with extremism. In their view, the rallies are part of a wave of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment fueled by President Donald Trump, who called for a ban on Muslims entering the country during his election campaign. Molly Freiburg, 33, of Philadelphia, was one of the counter-protesters but not part of the larger group clad in black.

This manifestation at the Capitol is actually a way to make our Muslim neighbors feel uncomfortable.  A representative for ACT for America could not be reached for comment. In Seattle, about 75 anti-sharia protesters were outnumbered by counter-protesters at a rally that was moved from Portland, Oregon. Tensions are running high in Portland after a man yelling religious and racial slurs at two teenage girls on a commuter train fatally stabbed two men who tried to stop him.     Talbot Sleater, a 62-year-old construction foreman, said that the Seattle protest was the first of the kind that he had attended. A Briton who moved to the United States, he said he had decided to go after recent attacks in his home country. Slideshow (13 Images) People are being run over in the street with trucks and little kids are being blown up,  Sleater said, referring to recent attacks in London and Manchester.  I don't want that to happen here.  The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the country's largest Muslim advocacy group, urged Americans to participate in one of several local educational events being organized in  a peaceful challenge to Saturday's hate rallies.   It also warned Muslims to take extra precautions against potential violence over the weekend. Anti-Muslim incidents rose 57 percent last year, including a 44 percent jump in anti-Islamic hate crimes, CAIR said in a report released in early May. Oath Keepers said on its website that it was  answering the call to defend free speech against those who would use terrorist violence or the threat of violence to shut it down.  The Southern Poverty Law Center says Oath Keepers is  one of the largest radical antigovernment groups in the United States,  organized around a  set of baseless conspiracy theories.  Refuse Fascism, a coalition of activists advocating confrontational tactics to oppose what it calls the Trump  regime,  said it would show up at the rallies  to counter the xenophobic hatred and lies, defy intimidation and drown it out.”  Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles and Frank McGurty in New York; Writing by Frank McGurty; Editing by Marguerita Choy, Mary Milliken and Chizu Nomiyama","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-islam-protests-idUSKBN1910RC"},

The 3-mile (4.8km) walk began in Hollywood and culminated with a rally in gay-friendly West Hollywood featuring Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of U.S. House of Representatives, the city's liberal Mayor Eric Garcetti and drag queen icon RuPaul.  We're people,  said Mary Demasters, 29, who wore a rainbow cape draped over her shoulders and a rainbow sticker on cheek.  We deserve to be treated like people, all of us, no matter what our differences are. We're all people.  Reflecting this year's emphasis on the common ground of liberal causes, including LGBT rights, Demasters carried a placard that read:  When you come for one of us, you come for all of us.  The event brought together a range of groups at the forefront of the country's most contentious political issues, including Planned Parenthood, Black Lives Matter, the American Civil Liberties Union and GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy organization.   This was not the year for parades. This was the year to take to the streets and march,  said Stephen Macias, a spokesman for the organizers, highlighting the wave of protests across the country since Trump's election in November.  The march is still about celebrating our community but it's also about recognizing the climate we live in and the delicate balance around civil rights,  Macias said.  The decision to shift the event's emphasis drew criticism from some in Southern California's lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and  queer  community, who say the one day of the year set aside to celebrate their LGBTQ identities should not be given over to other political causes. It marks the second year in a row that Los Angeles Pride organizers have faced dissension. In 2016, some activists boycotted pride events on the grounds that they had lost their focus on the larger gay community to become a music festival catering largely younger people. People participate in a Resist March that replaced the annual Pride Parade in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 11, 2017.Andrew CullenMacias said the complaints about this year's Resist March reflected a misunderstanding about the intentions of the organizers. The weekend would still feature gay pride festivities across the Los Angeles area, he said.  The march is still about celebrating our community but it's also about recognizing the climate we live in and the delicate balance around civil rights,  he said. The march this year was staged a day after anti-corporate protesters briefly blocked the route of a Washington, D.C., pride parade, in part to voice their opposition to such backers as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N).

In response, Ryan Bos, executive director of Capital Pride Alliance, released a statement on Sunday acknowledging the importance of considering differing points of view.  We encourage a robust, civil, and healthy conversation within the community about all of the issues that impact us and look forward to having a mutually respectful conversation in the days, weeks, and months ahead,  Bos said.  Gay pride events are scheduled for major cities across the United States this month, some of them this weekend. In San Francisco, pride organizers have not dropped their parade in favor of a protest but the SF Weekly newspaper reported that the event would include a  resistance contingent  and an immigrant rights speaker.

Finishing ninth, the 18-year-old Williams driver became the first Canadian not named Villeneuve to score in a grand prix and also the second youngest F1 driver of all time on the scoresheet. It had not been shaping up before then as a very memorable home-coming for the youngster, who grew up in Montreal watching races at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and dreaming of one day being on the grid. A string of uninspiring results in his first six races followed by a disappointing qualifying effort that had him starting 17th for Sunday's race had dampened excitement around Stroll's home debut. But with veteran team mate Felipe Massa crashing out on the opening lap through no fault of his own, Stroll delivered the controlled and clinical drive that his team and fans had been waiting for. He became the second youngest driver to score a point behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who was 17 when he finished seventh in Malaysia for Toro Rosso in 2015.  It feels so good in so many ways,  said Stroll.  Words can’t really describe it. It’s been a tricky beginning of the season.  As I was saying at the beginning of the weekend, it’s just about having a clean Sunday and it will come to us. That’s exactly what happened today.  The milestone 50th Canadian Grand Prix, at a circuit named after Quebec motor racing icon Gilles Villeneuve who won the Canadian Grand Prix in 1978, provided the perfect backdrop for the breakthrough. Gilles's son Jacques never won on the track but did win the drivers' title in 1997.  The most important thing for us today was Lance,  said Williams deputy principal Claire Williams.  He’s had a tough start to the year, hasn’t he? And to have a race like today, scored his first points, every rookie wants to do that and that’s what he did today.   For it to happen in his home grand prix, it couldn’t be better. It’s just a dream come true for him.  The son of one of Canada's richest men, Stroll has had a tepid welcome to Formula One in some quarters with the focus on his father's fortune. But Sunday's race-winner and triple world champion Lewis Hamilton gave Stroll a positive grade for his work so far and preached patience.  I know he’s had such a difficult season,  said Hamilton, who gave the youngster a wave when Stroll was about to be lapped and let him past without fuss.  He’s been dropped in the deep end, critics, all those different things you have when you’re 18-years-old and you’re experiencing your first time in Formula One and one of the most difficult seasons.   I thought he looked like he was doing a good job.  Editing by Alan Baldwin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-f1-canada-stroll-idUSKBN19300B"},

Fernando Alonso, whose Indianapolis 500 hopes had been cruelly let down by a Honda engine failure last month, returned to the Formula One fold and was running in 10th place until, again, the Honda power unit packed up. The once great former champions, the second most successful team in the sport in terms of race wins, remain adrift at the bottom of the constructors' standings without a point after seven races.  For the first time this season, running in 10th place within spitting distance of the flag, we dared to hope,  said Racing Director Eric Boullier in the team's post race press release.  OK, what we were daring to hope for were hardly rich pickings: a solitary world championship point for Fernando, who had driven superbly all afternoon, as he's driven superbly every race-day afternoon for the past two-and-a-half years.  Related CoverageGrowing up fast, Stroll scores first points But, after so much toil and heartache, even that single point would have felt like a victory. And then came yet another gut-wrenching failure.  It's difficult to find the right words to express our disappointment, our frustration and, yes, our sadness. So I'll say only this: it's simply, and absolutely, not good enough,  concluded the Frenchman. McLaren executive director Zak Brown, who has ramped up criticism of the team's engine partner this week, reiterated that.  It should have been a point. It just let go without any warning,  he told Sky Sports television.  It feels like you could probably replay this interview at a lot of races this year. Very frustrating.  This just kind of reinforces that we can't just kind of sit around and wait for things to come good. We need to be proactive in that.   Honda's F1 head Yusuke Hasegawa said the power unit had lost oil pressure due to a mechanical issue and would be taken back to Japan for further inspection. Alonso brought his car to a halt and clambered into the nearby grandstands to join the fans.  I thought to give the gloves to the grandstands but it was a little bit too far so I thought I would go a little bit closer,  said the Spaniard. The double world champion's season has been littered with engine failures and grid penalties and he could see little sign of that changing.  We will start last probably in Baku,  he said, referring to the next race in Azerbaijan.  It's a tough time.

Gas shortages are increasingly hitting households during the chilly winter months, often when people are trying to prepare dinner or need to heat their homes in the evenings. “What else can one do other than burning fuelwood, when one does not get gas supplied at his home?” grumbled Muhammad Razzaq, a 50-year-old government employee, as he recently collected a load of firewood. Last winter, he said, he needed to buy firewood for cooking and heating water for bathing and dishwashing when no gas was available at his rented home on the outskirts of Islamabad. Summer temperatures have now reduced the need for heating, but environmentalists worry that worsening gas shortages are fueling a new surge of deforestation in the country – and could derail ambitious efforts to plant trees and reverse the country’s large-scale forest losses. “We and our environment will be completely deprived of the environmental and health gains of these afforestation programs by 2030,  said Riffat Naseem Malik of the Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management at the University of Haripur in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, which is working to replant a billion new trees  People will be chopping down these trees even more rapidly to meet their domestic energy needs as long as the government fails to stave off the huge gas supply shortfall,” he said. Turn on the Gas Gas consumption in Pakistan has grown by more than 80 percent over the last 20 years. As the country’s population grows rapidly, the number of domestic gas connections has more than doubled, from around 4 million to 8.4 million, according to the Pakistan Economic Survey 2016-17. Although the government reports that just under 30 percent of households have access to gas, the state-owned Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority estimates domestic gas demand to be 5.8 billion cubic feet per day, compared to production of around 4.1 billion cubic feet – a shortfall of 1.7 billion cubic feet. The authority warned in April this year that by 2030 the gap will rise to as much as 3.9 billion cubic feet per day. The country is unable to meet demand in part because of inadequate investment in gas exploration in Pakistan, due in part to the country’s poor security situation. But experts point to other factors behind the gas shortfall as well, including inadequate maintenance of existing gas pipeline networks, the diversion of large quantities of gas from supplying households to fuelling power plants in order to cut oil import expenses, and a steep rise in the conversion of vehicles to compressed natural gas as a cheap fuel source. Mukhtar Ahmed, a former energy adviser to the prime minister, estimates that by 2030 Pakistan’s overall demand for energy will increase 350 percent, while the proportion of the country’s total energy needs met from domestic sources will fall from 72 percent to 38 percent. Less Gas, Fewer Trees? The gas shortfall has alarmed forest and environment experts in a country where 27,000 hectares (67,000 acres) of forest are chopped down each year, according to the government’s National Forest Policy, published in 2015. A report by the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization says that deforestation has averaged 42,000 hectares annually since 1990, reducing the country’s forested area by more than 40 percent between 1990 and 2015. Forests now cover less than 2 percent of Pakistan’s land area, one of the lowest levels in the region, the report said. Conservationists fear worsening gas shortages could reverse recent forest gains from projects such as the ambitious Billion Tree Tsunami project in the northwest province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and the prime minister’s Green Pakistan Program, which aims to plant 100 million trees nationally over a five-year period. The architect of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa project, Malik Amin Aslam, said that the provincial government is working on plans to reduce people’s reliance on fuel wood. Solar and Hydropower Push The province is supporting the installation of more than 350 community-based micro-hydropower projects, at a cost of 5 billion Pakistani rupees ($48 million), to electrify millions of off-grid rural households, he said.  The small hydropower plants will generate 35 megawatts of electricity, he said. “The project is already 70 percent completed and, in fact, the ambition has recently been expanded to take it to 1,000 micro-hydro units by 2018. As these remote locations are close to or in the middle of pristine natural forests, this provides a carbon-free alternative to cutting trees,” Amin Aslam said. Solar energy projects similarly are being put in place to reduce the need for fuel wood, he said, including a plan to provide solar cooking stoves and water heaters in the forest areas around Chitral district. The aim, he said, is that “the trees being planted today in the province will remain intact, as by the time they grow fully mature people will have solar-powered and electricity-run efficient domestic stoves in their kitchens and rooms for cooking and health as well as solar and electric geysers in their bathrooms for bathing in winter”. With domestic oil and gas supplies forecast to be exhausted by 2025 and 2030 respectively, according a report by the U.S.-based National Bureau of Asian Research, the Pakistani government has also expedited efforts to import gas. The federal minister for petroleum and natural resources, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, said work had begun to fast-track gas import projects, including the Iran-Pakistan pipeline, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline and the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In February the government signed a 15-year agreement with Qatar to import up to 3.75 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year. “Pakistan is well on track to have 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of LNG in the system by end of 2017, which will halve the country’s current total gas shortfall,” Abbasi said in an interview.

Consumer spending in May was 0.8 percent lower than in the same month in 2016 after adjusting for inflation, the first year-on-year fall since September 2013, Visa said on Monday. Sales fell by a hefty 1.9 percent in monthly terms.      Our index clearly shows that with rising prices and stalling wage growth, more of us are starting to feel the squeeze,  Visa managing director Kevin Jenkins said. Britain's economy has shown signs that it is stagnating and confidence among businesses and consumers it expected to take a further hit after Prime Minister Theresa May failed to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election.  She now plans to lead a minority government with support from Northern Ireland's main unionist party, raising questions about how Britain will progress in Brexit talks and whether another election might be called soon. After shrugging off the initial impact of last year's vote to leave the European Union, the effects of sterling's more than 10 percent fall is catching up with Britons in the form of higher inflation, which is its strongest since September 2013. Sterling weakened again after last week's inconclusive election result and businesses have said the election result risks paralyzing the government at a time when it is meant to be negotiating a smooth exit from the European Union. [nL8N1J631M] Retail sales in the first three months of 2017 suffered their biggest fall since 2010. Data published on Friday showed industrial output and construction faltered again in April. Britain's overall economy was the weakest performer among the Group of Seven rich nations in the first quarter of 2017. Visa said bricks-and-mortar retailers suffered their biggest fall in sales in five years, which was only partly offset by strong growth in online sales. Growth in spending at hotels and restaurants - which has risen much faster than at retailers in recent quarters - slowed to an annual 3.3 percent. Spending on transport and clothing were the categories with the biggest falls.  The outlook for consumer spending continues to look relatively bleak, with households facing faster increases in living costs and muted wage growth,  said Annabel Fiddes, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the data for Visa.  The squeeze on household finances is likely to get worse as the Bank of England forecasts faster increases in consumer prices in the coming months,  she added. The Visa figures strip out seasonal and inflation effects, and are adjusted to take account of the growing share of spending on cards rather than cash.

The fund is focused on lending to companies in healthcare, financial services and software, and will provide growth capital and financing for leveraged buyouts and dividend recapitalizations, Chris Flynn, Co-CEO of THL Credit Advisors LLC, told Reuters in an interview.  If you think of our clients, who are private-equity sponsors, anytime we increase our capital base, they're pleased because we have more potential financing solutions to meet their capital needs,  said Flynn. The fund targets companies with between $5 million and $50 million in 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The new fund will work on financings with partners of up to $100 million, holding on to as much as $50 million for its own books across its platform, according to Flynn. The financings will be provided across companies' capital structures, as first-lien or other loans backed by collateral, the company said. THL Credit has five offices in the United States.

Fernando Alonso, whose Indianapolis 500 hopes had been cruelly let down by a Honda engine failure last month, returned to the Formula One fold and was running in 10th place until, again, the Honda power unit packed up. The once great former champions, the second most successful team in the sport in terms of race wins, remain adrift at the bottom of the constructors' standings without a point after seven races.  For the first time this season, running in 10th place within spitting distance of the flag, we dared to hope,  said Racing Director Eric Boullier in the team's post race press release.  OK, what we were daring to hope for were hardly rich pickings: a solitary world championship point for Fernando, who had driven superbly all afternoon, as he's driven superbly every race-day afternoon for the past two-and-a-half years.  Related CoverageGrowing up fast, Stroll scores first points But, after so much toil and heartache, even that single point would have felt like a victory. And then came yet another gut-wrenching failure.  It's difficult to find the right words to express our disappointment, our frustration and, yes, our sadness. So I'll say only this: it's simply, and absolutely, not good enough,  concluded the Frenchman. McLaren executive director Zak Brown, who has ramped up criticism of the team's engine partner this week, reiterated that.  It should have been a point. It just let go without any warning,  he told Sky Sports television.  It feels like you could probably replay this interview at a lot of races this year. Very frustrating.  This just kind of reinforces that we can't just kind of sit around and wait for things to come good. We need to be proactive in that.   Honda's F1 head Yusuke Hasegawa said the power unit had lost oil pressure due to a mechanical issue and would be taken back to Japan for further inspection. Alonso brought his car to a halt and clambered into the nearby grandstands to join the fans.  I thought to give the gloves to the grandstands but it was a little bit too far so I thought I would go a little bit closer,  said the Spaniard. The double world champion's season has been littered with engine failures and grid penalties and he could see little sign of that changing.  We will start last probably in Baku,  he said, referring to the next race in Azerbaijan.  It's a tough time.

A government website for the non-binding referendum, Puerto Rico's fifth such plebiscite since 1967, showed 97 percent supported statehood. Only 23 percent of the 2.2 million eligible voters participated in the vote. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello campaigned for statehood as the best avenue to boost future growth for the island, which has $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate, woefully underperforming schools and near-insolvent pension and health systems.  From today going forward, the Federal government will no longer be able to ignore the voice of the majority of the American citizens in Puerto Rico,  Rossello said in a statement.  It would be highly contradictory for Washington to demand democracy in other parts of the world, and NOT respond to the legitimate right to self-determination that was exercised today in the American territory of Puerto Rico,  he added. Puerto Rico's hazy political status, dating back to its 1898 acquisition by the United States from Spain, has contributed to the economic crisis that pushed it last month into the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.  I voted for statehood,  Armando Abreu, a 74-year-old retiree, said after voting.  Even if it's still a long way off in the distance, it's our only hope.  Those in favor of statehood for the mainly Spanish-speaking Caribbean island hope the new status would put the territory on equal standing with the 50 U.S. states, giving them more access to federal funds and the right to vote for U.S. president. FILE PHOTO: The flags of the U.S. and Puerto Rico fly outside the Capitol building in San Juan, Puerto Rico May 4, 2017.Alvin BaezUnder the current system, Puerto Rico's 3.5 million American citizens do not pay federal taxes, vote in presidential elections or receive proportionate federal funding on programs like the Medicaid health insurance system for the poor. The U.S. government oversees policy and financial areas such as infrastructure, defense and trade. Rossello will ask Congress to respect the result, but Puerto Rico is seen as a low priority in Washington.    'Bogus Plebiscite' Slideshow (11 Images)The island's two main opposition parties boycotted the vote, which gave Puerto Ricans three options: becoming a U.S. state; remaining a territory; or becoming an independent nation, with or without some continuing political association with the United States. Puerto Rico's former governor, Rafael Hernandez Colon, said in a statement:  A contrived plebiscite fabricated an artificial majority for statehood by disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of Commonwealth supporters.  Rather than heading to the polls, some 500 Puerto Ricans marched on the streets of San Juan, waving Puerto Rico's flag and burning the American flag while chanting in support of independence.    This is a bogus plebiscite. Our future is independence. We need to be able to decide our own fate,  said Liliana Laboy, one of the organizers of the protest. Boycotters were also angry about the costly referendum at a time when over 400 schools have closed and many Puerto Ricans are struggling to make ends meet. Schools where voting took place were in poor condition, with cracked paint and bare-bones playgrounds. Puerto Rico spent an estimated $8 million on the campaign and election process, according to a government spokesman.

He shot a bogey-free four-under-par 66 to emerge top of a crowded leaderboard for a one-shot victory over South African Charl Schwartzel (66) and South Korean Kim Meen-whee (67). On a day when Phil Mickelson was tied for the lead until a triple-bogey at the 12th, Berger finished at 10-under 270 at TPC Southwind in Tennessee, joining Dave Hill, Lee Trevino and David Toms as back-to-back winners of an event that started in 1958. “I’m one-for-one defending titles, so that’s a pretty good stat,” Berger joked after securing his second PGA Tour victory at the age of 24. “I can’t believe I won again. It’s been a battle. I’m extremely proud.” Berger revealed that he had cracked his driver pre-tournament, but found a more than adequate replacement club.  “I hit it phenomenally,” he said, adding that by spooky coincidence his hotel room number had been the same as last week. He will head with renewed confidence to the U.S. Open starting at Erin Hills in Wisconsin on Thursday, while Schwartzel will also have a spring in his step after his near miss. “I putted better today. I stroked the ball well,” said Schwartzel, the 2011 U.S. Masters champion, whose putting does not always match the quality of his long game. Mickelson, meanwhile, admitted he had become unusually flustered after seeing a leaderboard on the 11th hole that showed him tied for the lead. “It shook me to be honest,” said the five-times major champion. “I didn’t expect to be there. It was as if I’d never won before, as if I was a rookie.” He promptly dropped three strokes at the par-four 12th and shot 68, finishing three shots behind Berger. Mickelson, 46, still looks like missing the U.S. Open, the only major he needs to complete the career grand slam of all four modern majors. He thinks he needs a four-hour weather delay in the first round on Thursday to make it for his tee time after he attends his daughter’s high school graduation ceremony in southern California. “I am going to keep my game sharp the next couple of days but it’s not looking good,” he said regarding his chances of playing in the U.S. Open.

Nick Gordon, 28, had bail set at $15,500 and was required to wear a GPS monitor by a judge at the Circuit Court of Seminole County in Sanford, according to video of the hearing posted online by WKMG-TV. He faces charges of battery and false imprisonment after an altercation early Saturday with Laura Leal, with whom Gordon has shared a residence, said Sanford Police spokesman Ronny Neal. Gordon argued with Leal after he became upset because he thought she was trying to  hook up  with one of his friends, a police report said. Gordon punched and hit her, and he refused to let her leave, it said.  He denied hitting the woman. It was not immediately clear if an attorney was representing him. Last fall, a Georgia judge entered the financial judgment against Gordon after he was held legally responsible for Bobbi Kristina Brown's 2015 death. Brown, the only child of R&B; singers Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, was discovered face down in the bathtub of her north Atlanta home and died about six months later without coming out of a coma. An autopsy found drug intoxication and the immersion of her face in the water contributed to her death. Brown's estate, which brought the lawsuit, accused Gordon of causing her death by giving her a  toxic mixture.  He was also accused of stealing from her bank account while she was comatose. Gordon has denied the allegations and said he tried to save Brown's life.

I had my first pole here, I had my first win here 10 years ago and to repeat it this weekend is incredibly special,  said Hamilton, who also started from pole for the sixth time in Canada.  I really have to thank my team for making this possible. The guys back at the factory have worked so hard to really fix what we had in the last race, bring it here and really give it to the Ferraris. I'm over the moon.  The Briton might have cut Vettel's lead further if not for an inspired charge by the German who fought his way to fourth after a damaged front wing forced a pitstop and dropped him to the back of the field early on. Red Bull's Australian Daniel Ricciardo came home third, for the third race in a row, to complete the podium. That gave his team something to cheer after young Dutchman Max Verstappen had his race come to a premature end with mechanical problems while running second and challenging Hamilton for the lead. Related CoverageNo underdog talk at Mercedes after Canada one-twoForce India enjoyed a great weekend in Canada with Mexican Sergio Perez taking fifth ahead of French team mate Esteban Ocon, who was not happy at the finish.  Obviously, we’re not the quickest car on the track at the moment but we’re managing to put it together on a Sunday,  said Ricciardo.  It’s nice obviously. Max had his problems today, I’m sure he would have been up there as well.   We’ll try to get both cars on the podium soon.  Clean Start Formula One - F1 - Canadian Grand Prix - Montreal, Quebec, Canada - 11/06/2017 - Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton (L) celebrates winning the race with teammate Valtteri Bottas.Chris WattieHamilton, starting from pole for a sixth time, got off to a clean start but behind him there was the usual Montreal first lap chaos. Vettel, starting alongside, got caught in a sandwich as Bottas shot past him on one side and Verstappen on the other, clipping the German's front wing.  I think it was clear that today we could have been better than fourth, but that's how we finished and what is done is done,  said Vettel.  Looking back at the start, Bottas and I were trying to go from the inside when Max came around but these things can happen.   Then, with the safety car on track I did not realize that the damage to the front wing was as bad as it actually was, we only noticed it at full speed.  Canadian teenage rookie Lance Stroll answered some of his critics by scoring his first points in Formula One for Williams, crossing the line in ninth place to the cheers of a sell-out home crowd. It has been a difficult debut for Stroll, the son of one of Canada's richest men, who has had some sharp criticism for his modest results. But the 18-year-old showed his skill to become the first Canadian not named Villeneuve to score points in a Formula One race. Ferrari's late great Gilles Villeneuve, after whom the Montreal circuit is named after, won the Canadian Grand Prix in 1978 while his son Jacques was the 1997 world champion.  It’s just special. It feels so good in so many ways,  said Stroll.  It’s been a tricky beginning of the season, we’ve known that we’re capable of doing it but there’s just been so much stuff in the way of being able to just get points.  There was yet more disappointment for Fernando Alonso and McLaren when the double world champion's engine gave up yet again two laps from the finish. McLaren remain the only team yet to score a point. Editing by Clare Fallon and Alan Baldwin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-f1-canada-idUSKBN19215C"},

As the world champions returned to the top of the constructors' championship, eight points ahead of their Italian rivals, they served notice that they are still the team to beat. Hamilton claimed his sixth Canadian victory, and third in a row at the sun-bathed but windswept Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, cruising home 19.7 seconds clear of his Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas.  A cruise like we had today was something we didn’t have for a long time so I’ll take that,  said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff, who had spoken in Monaco two weeks ago of them being underdogs now.  You can see the relief in the team that we’ve bounced back after such a difficult weekend, it’s just what the doctor ordered.  The mood was not nearly as upbeat when Mercedes arrived in Montreal on the back of a miserable Monaco where triple world champion Hamilton qualified 13th and finished seventh, with Bottas fourth. Ferrari, with championship leader Sebastian Vettel chalking up his third win in six races, had just scored their first one-two finish since 2010. The situation was reversed on Sunday, with Vettel dropping well down the field after having to stop and replace a damaged front wing before charging back to fourth. His team mate Kimi Raikkonen was seventh. Despite coming to one of his favourite circuits, Hamilton went into the weekend with more questions than answers about the Monaco meltdown but Sunday provided plenty of comfort.  I don't think in the five years I've been with the team that I've seen them pull so well together and really work towards the same cause...and then come here and deliver what we’ve delivered -- a great blow to the Ferraris,  said Hamilton. While Mercedes quickly rediscovered their mojo, they will need to keep it with Vettel leading Hamilton in the drivers' championship by 12 points.  We came here, the car’s back to where it should be. It doesn’t mean it’s going to be like that every time, but I think we learned a lot,  said Hamilton.  I think it should put us in a strong position from here moving forwards. We know which direction we need to be developing the car from now on.  Reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-f1-canada-mercedes-idUSKBN19218C"},

Japan's defence ministry has invited Southeast Asian military representatives from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam to a separate military technology seminar, aiming to ensure attendance for the three-day Maritime Air Systems and Technologies Asia (MAST) show near Tokyo, two sources said.  The Ministry of Defence is hosting the seminar right after MAST closes,  said one of the sources with knowledge of the plan. Abe's government wants to make arms sales and military technology collaboration a new plank of Japanese diplomacy in Southeast Asia as it counters China's growing influence in the South China Sea. About $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes through the strategic waterway each year, much of it to and from Japan. In 2014, Abe ended a decades-old arms export ban, partly to cut procurement costs by widening arms production, but also, for the first time since World War Two, to allow Japan to offer arms technology as a lure for closer military ties. The small Southeast Asian arms market is growing as economic growth boosts defense spending. Japan is likely push to back against China's offers to supply military equipment to the region.  The only thing that really matters in Southeast Asia is cost and China will offer at low cost,  said Paul Burton, director of aerospace, defence and security at IHS Markit in Singapore.  They will quite happily give away the family jewels in terms of enabling indigenous production, training the local workforce and offset into other sectors.  Less Reluctant In their first outing at MAST Asia in 2015 Japanese firms were still reluctant to advertise their defence work to a public wary of any return to militarism. Only NEC Corp exhibited alone, with other firms clustering together in a single display. That hesitation seems to have eased. At least 16 Japanese firms are exhibiting alone, from leading arms maker Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , to the maker of the sub-hunting P-1 patrol jet, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and ShinMaywa Industries, which builds the US-2 amphibious plane.  We intend to showcase our wide range of products and technologies to event participants,  said a spokesman for Mitsubishi Heavy. Showcased items include a guided missile destroyer display, a prototype amphibious vehicle model, minehunting technology and demonstrations of a laser radar surveillance system. The three-day show will include overseas exhibitors, such as F-35 stealth fighter maker Lockheed Martin Corp and France's Thales SA, and will have double the floor space of the 2015 event, a spokeswoman for the organiser said.

The 3-mile (4.8km) walk began in Hollywood and culminated with a rally in gay-friendly West Hollywood featuring Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of U.S. House of Representatives, the city's liberal Mayor Eric Garcetti and drag queen icon RuPaul.  We're people,  said Mary Demasters, 29, who wore a rainbow cape draped over her shoulders and a rainbow sticker on cheek.  We deserve to be treated like people, all of us, no matter what our differences are. We're all people.  Reflecting this year's emphasis on the common ground of liberal causes, including LGBT rights, Demasters carried a placard that read:  When you come for one of us, you come for all of us.  The event brought together a range of groups at the forefront of the country's most contentious political issues, including Planned Parenthood, Black Lives Matter, the American Civil Liberties Union and GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy organization.   This was not the year for parades. This was the year to take to the streets and march,  said Stephen Macias, a spokesman for the organizers, highlighting the wave of protests across the country since Trump's election in November.  The march is still about celebrating our community but it's also about recognizing the climate we live in and the delicate balance around civil rights,  Macias said.  The decision to shift the event's emphasis drew criticism from some in Southern California's lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and  queer  community, who say the one day of the year set aside to celebrate their LGBTQ identities should not be given over to other political causes. It marks the second year in a row that Los Angeles Pride organizers have faced dissension. In 2016, some activists boycotted pride events on the grounds that they had lost their focus on the larger gay community to become a music festival catering largely younger people. People participate in a Resist March that replaced the annual Pride Parade in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 11, 2017.Andrew CullenMacias said the complaints about this year's Resist March reflected a misunderstanding about the intentions of the organizers. The weekend would still feature gay pride festivities across the Los Angeles area, he said.  The march is still about celebrating our community but it's also about recognizing the climate we live in and the delicate balance around civil rights,  he said. The march this year was staged a day after anti-corporate protesters briefly blocked the route of a Washington, D.C., pride parade, in part to voice their opposition to such backers as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N). Miguel Luevano of Pasadena holds a Donald Trump pinata during the Resist March that replaced the annual Pride Parade in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 11, 2017.Andrew CullenThe Washington protesters also demanded the addition of a transgender minority woman to the board of organizer Capital Pride Alliance, and that the parade bar police officers from marching. In response, Ryan Bos, executive director of Capital Pride Alliance, released a statement on Sunday acknowledging the importance of considering differing points of view.  We encourage a robust, civil, and healthy conversation within the community about all of the issues that impact us and look forward to having a mutually respectful conversation in the days, weeks, and months ahead,  Bos said.  Gay pride events are scheduled for major cities across the United States this month, some of them this weekend. In San Francisco, pride organizers have not dropped their parade in favor of a protest but the SF Weekly newspaper reported that the event would include a  resistance contingent  and an immigrant rights speaker.

Ariya put her right hand to her mouth in disbelief and then burst into tears after holing a 30-footer at the first extra hole to outlast American Lexi Thompson and South Korean Chun In-gee in Cambridge, Ontario. Ariya’s joy stood in stark contrast to the disappointment felt by Thompson, who frittered away a two-shot lead in regulation by three-putting the final two holes for two bogeys. “I just can’t believe I've won the tournament because when I got here I didn’t feel comfortable hitting the golf ball,” an emotional Ariya told Golf Channel. “I was scared to hit my tee shot. (Now) I feel better.” Ariya carded a closing three-under-par 69 in breezy conditions at Whistle Bear, while Thompson shot 72 and Chun 70. They all finished at 17-under 271. Ariya is almost certain to take over from Lydia Ko as the world number one when the rankings are updated on Monday.  Ariya was set to take over last Monday, but ended up staying at number two after the ranking projections were bungled. The 21-year-old from Bangkok has now had six LPGA victories, all since the start of last season. Ariya would not have had a chance to win on Sunday if Thompson had not suffered a meltdown, her jangled nerves betraying her when under pressure with the putter. Thompson lipped out a five-foot putt at the penultimate hole and had a chance to make amends with a four-footer to win it at the last but hit a poor putt to fall back into the playoff.

The state election commission put the turnout at 41.5 percent, the lowest since 2008, with many Kosovars frustrated over the lack of economic progress and a deep level of corruption. In 2010 and 2014, it was 48 and 43 percent, respectively.  The biggest surprise was the opposition Vetevendosje party, which was poised to finish second.   Vetevendosje won these votes because they want to punish the governing parties,  said Ismet Kryeziu, the head of Democracy in Action.   It has to do with the high level of corruption and how the state is run,  he said.

They want to stay because they have created a lot of privileges for themselves,  said Hasan Visoka, 62, after voting in a school in the capital, Pristina.  Nothing will change. It doesn't matter who comes to power, we'll continue to be poor, without a future,  Arta Kelmendi, 28, said after voting.  But if Haradinaj does become prime minister, it will probably complicate relations with Serbia, which has issued an international warrant for his arrest on war crimes charges. The new government will also have to try to strike a border demarcation deal with Montenegro, which is the last condition for the European Union to grant visa-free travel for Kosovars.  Kosovo's neighbors Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia have all already secured visa-free travel to EU member states. Kosovo's economy has been growing steadily and is forecast to expand by about 4 percent in 2017, but the growth is mainly down to remittances from a million or so Kosovars living abroad. Kosovo declared independence in 2008, nine years after NATO bombing drove out Serbian forces accused of killing and expelling Kosovo Albanian civilians as Serbia tried to put down an ethnic Albanian insurgency.

Even so, Oscar Lopez Rivera still wanted to march in the annual celebration of Puerto Rican heritage, said Louis Maldonado, a member of the parade's board. This year was the first opportunity he had to do so since being released from prison after serving 35 years on sedition charges.  “The reality is we did not convince him to do that. This was his decision. His decision alone,  Maldonado told WABC-TV when asked if organizers bowed to political pressure by dropping plans to give Lopez Rivera a  National Freedom Hero  award.  He did so because he saw the level of divisiveness that was happening in our community,  Maldonado said. As the parade marched up Fifth Avenue on Sunday morning, there was little sign of the firestorm of criticism that has surrounded the event since organizers announced their plans.       Thousands of cheering spectators lined the route, many of them waving small Puerto Rican flags. The crowd applauded wildly as Lopez Rivera, 74, rode past on a colorful float decorated with leaping fish. He gave a  thumbs up  and thrust a clenched fist in the air. Organizers expected 1.5 million to watch Sunday's event, held the same day as the U.S. territory holds a referendum on statehood. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was among the public figures who decided against marching in the parade once it was known Lopez Rivera was being considered as the honoree. New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the nation's largest police union, called for a boycott of the annual celebration by Americans with roots on the Caribbean island, home to 3.5 million residents.  JetBlue Airways Corp, AT&T; Inc and other major advertisers pulled their sponsorships over Lopez Rivera's participation.  I think it's good that he declined it because it was entirely distracting from the issue at hand, which is Puerto Rico,  Mayor Bill de Blasio, who planned to march all along, said last week.  That’s the only thing this parade should have been about.  In 1981, Lopez Rivera was convicted of sedition and other charges, along with other members of the Armed Forces of National Liberation, known by its Spanish-language acronym as FALN. U.S. authorities said the group was responsible for dozens of bombings in the 1970s and 1980s in a campaign to secure Puerto Rico's independence.  Lopez Rivera, who was sentenced to 55 years in prison, plus 15 additional years for a foiled escape plot, was freed in January during President Barack Obama's final days in office.   Lopez Rivera's supporters, including  Hamilton  playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and other celebrities, view him as a symbol of Puerto Rican nationalism and the campaign to end what they see as the colonial status of the U.S. territory, acquired by the United States after the Spanish-American War. Critics of the decision to honor Rivera say he is a convicted criminal who helped carry out the 1975 bombing of New York's Fraunces Tavern and other deadly attacks. No one was ever charged in connection with that bombing. After Lopez Rivera declined the award, City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito said publicly she would find a way to honor him at the parade. Currently, Puerto Rico is struggling with $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and critically underfunded healthcare and pension systems. A federal oversight board appointed by U.S. Congress is managing its finances.  Against that backdrop, Puerto Ricans on Sunday will cast votes on whether their struggling island should become the 51st U.S. state. Even if islanders vote in favor of statehood in the referendum, Puerto Rico's fifth since 1967, statehood would require an act of the U.S. Congress.

His party, La Republique En Marche!, pulled off a stunning coup on Sunday by topping the first round of polls little more than a year after it was founded. It looks set to win a big parliamentary majority after the second-round vote on June 18. But this is not quite the ringing endorsement of his economic reform proposals that it appears.  Macron has been straight with voters about his reform plans and unveiled proposed changes to labour laws before the first round of elections for the 577-seat National Assembly. That’s a contrast with his predecessor Francois Hollande. The Socialist declared the world of finance was his enemy during the 2012 campaign but changed course part-way through his tenure, embracing labour reforms that were opposed by some within his own party, let alone trade unions. Macron’s government is therefore likely to have a stronger hand when it comes to negotiating contentious changes to the labour code, such as expanding the range of issues that can be decided at company level rather than sector by sector, or limiting compensation awards in unfair dismissal cases.  But there’s no easy ride ahead. The surest indication of this is the abstention rate in the first round, which was more than half, according to Interior Ministry figures based on a partial count of votes. That’s partly because of a lack of real mainstream alternatives. The mainstream Socialists and the centre-right Les Republicains have been in disarray since their candidates were knocked out in the first round of the presidential elections in April. Chaos in the two parties was compounded after Macron raided their ranks to form his government. Adding to the electoral confusion, some candidates are running in the legislatives under the banner of a mainstream party but say they are willing to cooperate with the new one. This may explain why so many people abstained and leaves Macron with a potential problem. Those who stayed away from the ballot box may be more willing to express their views on the streets once he starts rolling out his reforms. That is when he will discover how many of his new allies are really fair-weather friends.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

[nL8N1J8039] She is seeking a deal with a small Northern Irish party so that she can stay in power. Below are a list of key dates faced by May in the coming week. Monday, June 12 - Northern Ireland talks The DUP and Irish nationalists Sinn Fein are due to restart talks to form a new power-sharing government in Northern Ireland and avoid devolved power reverting to the British parliament in London for the first time in a decade.  The sides have until June 29 to secure a deal, but observers fear any concessions to the DUP by May's Conservatives could complicate the talks, deepening the region's political crisis. - May's top team of ministers to meet May has confirmed five of her most senior ministers will remain in their pre-election roles. She has kept in place her broader team of ministers too, with only a few changes. Defense Minister Michael Fallon said on Sunday the cabinet would meet  early next week . Cabinet meetings usually take place on a Tuesday but British media have reported it could meet on Monday. - May meeting with Conservative lawmakers May is due to meet with Conservative lawmakers in parliament. The chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative lawmakers Graham Brady has told BBC radio's Westminster Hour program that the meeting has been brought forward to Monday. British media have reported that moves were afoot within May's party to dislodge her after her election gamble - aimed at increasing her party's majority in parliament ahead of Brexit talks - backfired. A leadership contest can be triggered if 15 percent of the Conservative's 318 lawmakers write to Brady saying they no longer have confidence in May. Tuesday, June 13 - May to meet with DUP leader Arlene Foster Discussions were held between May's Conservatives and the DUP over the weekend with a view to the Northern Irish party supporting May's minority government on key votes in parliament. Foster is due to travel to London on Tuesday to meet May to discuss the details of a possible arrangement.  - May to travel to France to meet President Emmanuel Macron - Parliament returns to elect speaker Parliament reconvenes following the national election to elect a speaker for the lower house, the House of Commons. Swearing in of lawmakers will then begin, and continue for the rest of the week. Thursday, June 15 - Bank of England's Mark Carney and Finance Minister Philip Hammond speak The two men in charge of Britain's economy deliver their annual Mansion House speech on Thursday when they are likely to try to calm businesses and investors worried by May's precarious grip on power and the uncertain outlook for the UK economy which has lost a lot of its momentum of 2016. Monday, June 19 - Brexit talks begin Talks on Britain's exit from the European Union are due to begin. May has said her government will go ahead with these discussions as planned. - State opening of parliament and Queen's Speech Parliament is due to be formally reopened. Queen Elizabeth will deliver the  Queen's Speech , setting out the government's plans for the new parliamentary session. The debate on the Queen's Speech usually lasts about five or six days. The vote at the end of this debate is considered an important symbolic test of the ability of a government to command the confidence of the House of Commons. If May can get through this vote with the help of the DUP she can continue in government. If not, the opposition Labour Party would expect to have an opportunity to put forward an alternative Queen's Speech and see if it could win the support of a majority in parliament. If neither party can command a majority in parliament for their Queen's Speech, it is likely a fresh election would be called.

It was not clear what triggered the armed clashes between rival rebel groups who hold sway in the city since it was seized last February from Islamic State militants. Turkey sent warplanes, tanks and artillery into Syria last year in support of the Arab Sunni rebels, an operation dubbed  Euphrates Shield  which was aimed at driving both Islamic State and Kurdish militia forces away from its border. Checkpoints were spread by the Turkish-controlled military council that runs the city where thousands of people have been returning in recent months with the gradual resumption of basic services, a resident who was contacted in the city said. The heavy clashes left several dead and scores injured, another rebel source said. Rebel infighting has been a major weakness of the revolt against President Bashar al Assad's rule since its earliest days, with rebel factions divided by both ideology and local power struggles.

The person briefed on the matter said the board will discuss Kalanick taking time off from the company. The discussion involved the possibility that Kalanick might return in a role  with less authority, this person said, either in a position other than CEO or as CEO with narrower responsibilities and subject to stronger oversight. The source said it is not clear that the board will make any decision to change Kalanick’s role. The board is expected to adopt a number of internal policy and management changes recommended by outside attorneys hired to investigate sexual harassment and the firm's broader culture. The outside lawyers made no recommendation about Kalanick.  An Uber spokesman had no comment. Kalanick did not immediately respond to requests for comment late on Saturday.  The meeting, which Uber has not publicized, could be a pivotal moment for the world's most valuable venture-backed private company, which has upended the tightly regulated taxi industry in many countries but has run into legal trouble with a rough-and-tumble approach to local regulations and the way it handles employees and drivers.  At the Sunday meeting, according to two people familiar with the matter, the seven voting members of Uber's board, including Kalanick, are expected to vote on recommendations made by the law firm of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, which conducted a review of the company's policies and culture. The review was launched in February after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published a blog post detailing what she described as sexual harassment and the lack of a suitable response by senior managers. Fowler now works for digital payments company Stripe.  Uber's board will likely tell employees and the public of its decisions by Tuesday, one of the sources said.  Kalanick has developed a reputation as an abrasive leader, and his approach has rubbed off on his company. The 40-year-old executive was captured on video in February berating an Uber driver.   I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,  Kalanick said in a statement following the video's release.  Uber board member Arianna Huffington said in March that Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a  scrappy entrepreneur  to be more like a  leader of a major global company.  The board has been looking for a chief operating officer to help Kalanick run the company since March. The report was prepared by Holder and partner Tammy Albarrán at Covington & Burling, which did not respond to requests for comment. It comes shortly after another law firm, Perkins Coie, submitted a separate report on sexual harassment and other employee concerns at the company.  On Tuesday, Uber responded to that report's findings by saying it had fired 20 employees for a variety of reasons, and was increasing training and adopting new policies. Uber said that report considered 215 cases encompassing sexual harassment, discrimination, unprofessional behavior, bullying and other employee complaints. Recommendations for Tighter Controls San Francisco-based Uber is valued at nearly $70 billion but has yet to turn a profit. Some of the recommendations in Holder's firm's report would force greater controls on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Kalanick have had a surprising amount of autonomy for a company with more than 12,000 employees, one person familiar with the matter said. Uber's more than 1.5 million drivers worldwide are classified as independent contractors rather than employees. Kalanick, along with two close allies, has voting control of the company.  The board's discussions come at a moment when Kalanick is facing a personal trauma: his mother died last month in a boating accident, in which his father was also badly injured. Employees and former employees interviewed by Holder's team complained about sexual and racial bias, bullying and retaliation, according to people familiar with their accounts. They said that Kalanick and his lieutenants had favorites who played by different rules than other employees, and that even those favorites were nervous that they could fall from grace, which they sometimes did. Uber declined comment on that characterization.  One of the issues that came to Holder’s team's attention, according to two people familiar with the matter, was the company’s handling of a crisis in India after one of its drivers was arrested for raping a customer. Though the man was convicted in 2015, Kalanick and other executives became convinced that the crime was a set up by a local competitor, former employees said. Eric Alexander, the head of Asian business, shared medical records internally that he argued showed that the woman had been assaulted but not raped, people who spoke to him said. Alexander was fired this week; he did not return messages seeking comment. Uber confirmed Alexander had left the company but declined to discuss the matter further.

This is the biggest testimony to U.S. failure in the Gulf,  the diplomat told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.  (It) gives others the impression the U.S. does not know how to manage the relationship with its allies or is incapable.  On Friday Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt tightened their squeeze on Qatar by putting dozens of figures and charities they link to the country on terrorism blacklists. Qatar's official overseer of charities denied on Sunday that philanthropic groups in the country backed terrorism, saying it deplored the accusation. Slideshow (2 Images)Iran Flights A peninsular nation of 2.5 million people, Qatar has for years punched well above its weight in world affairs by parleying its vast gas wealth into influence across the region, irking many with its maverick stances and support for Islamists. But it was importing 80 percent of its food from bigger Gulf Arab neighbors before they cut ties and is now in talks with Iran and Turkey to secure food and water supplies. Iran - the main regional rival of Saudi Arabia - sent four cargo planes of food to Qatar and plans to provide 100 tonnes of fruit and vegetables every day, Iranian officials said on Sunday, amid concerns of shortages. Senior officials from the countries opposed to Qatar have warned it that appealing for foreign assistance will not advance a reconciliation. Qatar's energy minister said on Sunday Doha remained committed to an oil output cut deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC producers last month. Mohammed al-Sada said in a statement:  circumstances in the region shall not prevent the state of Qatar from honoring its international commitment of cutting its oil production . In a sign Gulf states were seeking to lessen the human impact of their June 5 severing of ties, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE said on Sunday they had set up hotlines to help families with Qatari members, without elaborating.

While some investors see bargains in lower valuations of regional banks' shares, few can point with any confidence to near-term catalysts for a turnaround in their fortunes. After outperforming larger banks in the wake of the Nov. 8 U.S. Presidential election, the S&P; 600 index of small cap banks are down 8.1 percent so far this year, data through Thursday showed, while the S&P; 500 index of the biggest U.S. banks is unchanged. The full S&P; 500, meanwhile, is up 8.7 percent. Last year, investors bet heavily that smaller, entirely U.S.-focused banks would benefit most from Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts, deregulation and economic stimulus. But those hopes dwindled dramatically as it became clear that President Trump would have difficulty gaining enough support to deliver on any of his pro-growth proposals.  I  would expect (smaller banks) to continue to underperform as long as we don't get some of these policy decisions to move through,  said Stephen Scouten, banking analyst for Sandler O’Neill in Atlanta. Fading hopes for an economic boost from Trump's agenda has compressed the gap between short- and long-term interest rates, putting pressure on bank loan profit margins. This is a bigger issue for regionals which have a greater dependence on lending for their profits than bigger, more diversified banks. Also, commercial and industrial loan growth has slowed this year after climbing steadily since late 2010. The Federal Reserve's latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, released May 8, showed domestic banks reporting weaker commercial and industrial loan demand from firms of all sizes in the first quarter. Waiting for Clarity Part of the problem is that companies are waiting for clarity on economic growth prospects and tax rates before making borrowing decisions, according to investors and analysts.  Eventually, for the smaller banks to outperform, concerns about the overall economy need to dissipate. Better economic growth usually leads to better lending growth and in that environment the yield curve steepens as well,  said Brian Kleinhanzl, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. Short selling has decreased in most regional and diversified banking sectors so far this year. But short interest in both the SPDR S&P; Bank Exchange Traded Fund and SPDR S&P; Regional Banking ETF increased as short sellers may be replacing exposure to individual banks with short bets on the sector. Short interest in the S&P; bank ETF is up 36 percent for the year while it is up 23 percent in the regional banking ETF. While tax cuts are viewed as one of the biggest boosts for regional banks of all Trump's policy proposals, investors are skeptical it will come any time soon. JPMorgan analysts on Thursday scaled back their forecast on the size of possible U.S. tax cuts and pushed out the timing to the second quarter of 2018 from the third quarter of 2017. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn has said he expects U.S. Congress to get tax reform done this year. But investors say 2018 would likely be the earliest this could happen. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected this month to unveil plans for regulating the U.S. banking sector including a relaxation of regulations for community banks, which have struggled with rules imposed after the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. While investors expect the administration to have trouble winning congressional support for legislative changes to regulations such as Dodd-Frank, some are hoping Trump will be able to appoint people to key regulatory positions. If Trump can replace the Federal Reserve's head of banking supervision, this might at least help slow the pace of regulation, said investment managers. Trump is expected to nominate Carnegie Mellon University professor Marvin Goodfriend and former Treasury Department staffer Randal Quarles to fill two of three open seats at the Fed, according to a New York Times report.  If they do get traction and get some of these (policy changes) done, even if they're more watered-down versions of what they had proposed, that's probably very good for sentiment and good for the fundamentals,  said Miles Lewis, portfolio manager for American Century Investments' Small Cap Value fund.

The global soccer body also confirmed that it had replaced a Qatari refereeing team who were due to officiate at a World Cup qualifying match involving the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday. In an interview published in Swiss newspapers Le Matin Dimanche and Sonntagszeitung, Infantino said he expected the diplomatic situation to be back to normal by the time the tournament is played in five-and-a-half years' time. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut links with Qatar last Monday, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism. Qatar says the allegations are based on lies. Asked if he believed that Qatar's hosting was in danger, Infantino replied:  No. In any case, I am not in the habit of speculating and I'm not going to this time either.  Infantino said that FIFA was watching the situation and was in regular contact with the Qatari authorities.  The essential role of FIFA, as I understand it, is to deal with football and not to interfere in geopolitics,  he said.   We are indeed facing a diplomatic crisis.   But on the other hand, I am confident that the region will return to a normalised situation. The World Cup is in 2022. In five years.  Obviously, if football can make a small contribution, in any way, to an improvement, I will not hesitate to offer my help.  FIFA confirmed in an emailed statement to Reuters that the UAE's match away to Thailand on Tuesday would no longer be refereed by Qatari officials.  We can confirm that FIFA has replaced the match officials originally appointed for the... game,  it said.  The decision has been taken for sporting reasons and in view of the current geopolitical situation.  FIFA added that it had changed the officials of its own accord and denied it had responded to a UAE request. The UAE federation said on Twitter that the match referee would now be Muhammad Taqi from Singapore.

The Athletics (27-35) gained a split in the doubleheader and snapped the Rays' four-game win streak. Healy hit a solo homer to left field off Rays reliever Ryne Stanek to give the Athletics a 4-2 lead and Pinder added a two-run opposite-field shot, also off Stanek. That was plenty of run support for Manaea (6-3), who gave up two runs and six hits in seven innings. He struck out five and threw 103 pitches, 67 for strikes.

Tampa Bay (33-32) made the score 3-2 in the bottom of the sixth when Evan Longoria hit a solo shot, the 250th homer of his career.  There aren't many players in this game who can say 250 and Evan is not anywhere close to stopping,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  We are fortunate to have him, a player who has performed as well as he has over his eight or nine years in the big leagues.  Brugman added his second RBI of the game in the ninth, a sacrifice fly that scored Davis. The Athletics got on the board quickly against Rays starter Matt Andriese with an RBI single from Yonder Alonso that scored Healy for a 1-0 lead. Alonso was 7-for-10 in the doubleheader.  That's a lot of hits,  Athletics manager Bob Melvin said.  A month's worth of hits for some people.  Tampa Bay answered in the bottom of the first with an RBI single from Longoria that scored Peter Bourjos. Andriese was removed after the first inning with a strained right groin, the same injury he that forced him on the 10-day DL late last month. He was replaced by Chih-Wei Hu.  It was the last pitch of the first inning,  Andriese said.  It was the same feeling. I hadn't felt it all week. We went through the rehab process and all good. Nothing. Was going at it 100 percent and didn't feel it at warmups. And then the last pitch on the changeup. I felt it walking off the mound.  In the second inning, Josh Phegley hit a solo homer off Hu to give the Athletics a 2-1 lead. Hu went four innings and gave up one run and two hits. He struck out five. Andriese threw just 21 pitches and gave up a run and three hits. Longoria's RBI single off Liam Hendriks in the bottom of the 10th inning lifted the Rays to a 6-5 win in the first game of a doubleheader. Longoria worked a full count and roped Hendriks' offering down the left-field line to score Bourjos and extend the Rays' win streak to four games.  It's been quite a while since I got a walk-off hit so it felt good,  Longoria said.  I was just thinking 'keep it simple.' I saw the ball pretty well in that at-bat. I got a mistake.

Speaking on ABC News'  This Week  in his first televised interview since Trump fired him in March as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, Bharara said he believed Trump's calls to him violated the usual boundaries between the executive branch and independent criminal investigators.  It's a very weird and peculiar thing for a one-on-one conversation without the attorney general, without warning between the president and me or any United States attorney who has been asked to investigate various things and is in a position hypothetically to investigate business interests and associates of the president,  Bharara said. He added that during President Barack Obama's tenure, Obama never called him directly. Bharara's comments came just a few days after former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey testified at a congressional panel that Trump had asked him to drop an investigation into former Trump aide Michael Flynn and his alleged ties to Russia. Comey also said he believed he was subsequently fired in an effort to undermine the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied allegations of collusion between his campaign and Russia and said he never directed Comey to drop the Flynn probe. A White House spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment. Bharara said on Sunday that Trump called him twice after the November election  ostensibly just to shoot the breeze.   It was a little bit uncomfortable, but he was not the president. He was only the president-elect,  Bharara said. The third call, however, came two days after Trump's inauguration. That time, he said, he refused to call back.  The call came in. I got a message. We deliberated over it, thought it was inappropriate to return the call. And 22 hours later I was asked to resign along with 45 other people,  he said. Bharara stopped short of saying whether he thought Trump had obstructed justice in his conversations and subsequent firing of Comey. However, he said he thought there was  absolutely evidence to begin a case  into the matter. Reporting by Sarah N.

Atlanta starter Matt Wisler (0-1) was added as the 26th man to pitch on Saturday. He pitched six innings and allowed four runs on six hits with three walks and seven strikeouts. One of those walks came with two outs in the fifth inning and started New York's opening three-run salvo.  He was good,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  I liked what I saw there. He's making some progress. Early on it was really good.  The Mets added a run in the sixth when Wilmer Flores tripled and scored on a Travis d'Arnaud sacrifice fly. Flores was 4-for-5 in the nightcap and 6-for-9 in the doubleheader to up his average to .333. The Braves scored their only run in the seventh when Dansby Swanson doubled and scored on Johan Camargo's single. The run ended a streak of 23 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings by New York starters. The Mets made it 6-1 in the eighth inning when Rivera connected for his second homer of the season, a two-run shot, against reliever Eric O'Flaherty. It was Rivera's first home run since May 5 against Miami. The Mets took a 3-0 lead in the fifth inning when Bruce hit a three-run shot, his 16th homer of the season. It was the second time Bruce went deep against Wisler this season, earlier touching him for a three-run shot.  Had a hard time keeping it rolling and keeping the game in check because the kid (Matz) was really good,  Snitker said.  I saw on his rehab he was up to 90 pitches and so he was ready to go and he's a tough ride anyway. We couldn't get anything going.  New York won the first game 6-1. Robert Gsellman pitched 6 2/3 scoreless innings and left fielder Yoenis Cespedes hit a grand slam, the fifth of his career, in his return from the disabled list. Gsellman (5-3) allowed only three hits, with two walks and four strikeouts. It was the first time in 11 starts this season that he has not given up a run. Sean Newcomb, considered Atlanta's top pitching prospect, made his major league debut. The left-hander (0-1) took the loss, despite allowing only one unearned run and four hits in 6 1/3 innings. He struck out seven and walked two. NOTES: The Mets activated LF Yoenis Cespedes from the disabled list. He had been sidelined since April 28 because of a left hamstring strain. Cespedes admitted he was not 100 percent, but said,  I feel that I am ready to play.  He started the first game, but not the nightcap. ... New York activated LHP Steven Matz for the second game of the doubleheader and sent INF Matt Reynolds to Triple-A Las Vegas. Matz has been on the disabled list all season because of left elbow inflammation. He was 0-1 with a 6.06 ERA in four rehab appearances. ...

That drama has led to gut-wrenching losses crippled by late-inning collapses this season. On Saturday, it was just the opposite. The Pirates scored three runs in the seventh inning to defeat the Miami Marlins 7-6 at PNC Park. With the Marlins leading 6-4 in the bottom of the seventh, Jordy Mercer sent a ball deep to center field. It seemed center fielder Christian Yelich had it tracked before the ball popped out of his glove, allowing Mercer to cruise into third with Andrew McCutchen and Elias Diaz scoring easily to tie it 6-6. John Jaso pinch-hit for right-hander Daniel Hudson (1-2), who got the win, and quickly lobbed a double off right-hander David Phelps (2-3) to right field, scoring Mercer and giving the Pirates an improbable 7-6 lead.  Mercer and those guys who got on base in the seventh, they did all the heavy lifting, really,  Jaso said.  My job was probably the easiest out of all of those guys.  Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at PiratesMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchPirates manager Clint Hurdle gave Jaso a bit more credit.  Sometimes you just have to give a man a chance to work,  Hurdle said regarding pinch-hitting Jaso.  He's been in a good place. Those are big swings. They're late in the game, too.  Pittsburgh (27-35) ended its four-game losing streak. Left-hander Felipe Rivero got the final four outs, including three strikeouts, to pick up his first save of the season.  It feels awesome,  Rivero said.  When you have months without coming out in the ninth, it feels like something new for you.  What would have been a somewhat disappointing win for the Marlins (27-34) suddenly turned into an even worse loss. Miami lost right fielder Giancarlo Stanton after Pirates right-hander Trevor Williams hit him in the first inning. Stanton was diagnosed with a right wrist contusion after undergoing X-rays, which came back negative. Stanton is day to day. Marlins manager Don Mattingly was cautiously optimistic.  It seems like it was OK. Nothing fractured or anything like that,  Mattingly said.  So we're just going to see where we're at. ... It was swelling. It ballooned up pretty quick.  The fact that there are no fractures just means basically there's going to be some swelling. It's going to be sore. How long's that going to be? It could be a few days. He could be walking in here tomorrow and thinking he could play.  After Stanton was hit, the Marlins took a 3-0 lead on two doubles in the first inning, with the second coming from J.T. Realmuto. Realmuto had three extra-base hits (one home run, two doubles) and three RBIs in his first three plate appearances. His second double gave Miami a 6-4 lead in the top of the fifth, one inning after he and Derek Dietrich hit back-to-back home runs to put the Marlins ahead 5-3. McCutchen doubled to drive in Josh Bell and cut Miami's lead to 3-1 in the second inning. He doubled again to tie it 3-3 in the third with his 500th career extra-base hit. Marlins right-hander Dan Straily was disappointed with his start. He allowed four runs and nine hits in four innings.  Watching back, I just didn't have it,  Straily said.  I didn't have the good stuff today. I kept us in the game as long as I could. It just happened to be four innings. It's very frustrating.  It's not at all what you envision your day being like when you come to the ballpark. Just have to get back to work and be ready to go next time.  NOTES: Pirates OF Andrew McCutchen became the eighth player in team history to hit 500 career extra-base hits. ...

And Saturday night Holmberg won his first game for the team that originally drafted him -- the Chicago White Sox. Jose Abreu and Melky Cabrera each had three hits and an RBI, and Holmberg pitched five solid innings to lead the White Sox to a 5-3 victory over the Cleveland Indians at Progressive Field. The win halted Chicago's three-game losing streak. The White Sox scored three runs in the first inning, an unearned run in the second, and an insurance run in the eighth, and Holmberg and four relievers made it stand up. Holmberg (1-0) gave up two runs and three hits with four strikeouts and one walk. David Robertson pitched the eighth and ninth innings to pick up his 10th save. Holmberg's long and winding road to his first win for the White Sox began in 2009, when the Sox selected him in the second round of the June draft. He was subsequently traded to Arizona, then traded to Cincinnati, granted free agency, signed with Atlanta, was released by Atlanta and, in 2016, signed again with the White Sox. Holmberg won four major league games during his travels, but Saturday was his first win for the White Sox. Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at IndiansChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatch It's kind of cool,  Holmberg said.  It's been a long time since I was drafted here, but I'm happy to finally get my first win for the White Sox.  Cleveland starter Josh Tomlin (3-8) gave up four runs (three earned) and nine hits in 2 2/3 innings.  He had traffic right from the first inning, and he couldn't find the feel for his breaking ball,  Indians manager Terry Francona said.  He didn't walk anyone, but there were a lot of hits.  Edwin Encarnacion and Carlos Santana homered for Cleveland. Santana's homer, a solo shot off reliever Dan Jennings in the sixth inning, cut Chicago's lead to 4-3. But the White Sox got that run back on a sacrifice fly by Kevan Smith in the eighth. Holmberg and the relivers took it from there.  It was nice to have that early cushion. I just tried to attack the hitters,  said Holmberg, who was moved into the rotation after starting the season in the bullpen.  We were hoping he could give us five (innings),  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said.  He did his job. He minimized the damage, and he did what he does, kept the ball down and gave us a chance.  The win was Holmberg's first since July 30, 2015, when he was with Cincinnati. The White Sox didn't waste any time driving Tomlin out of the game. Chicago sent seven men to the plate in the first inning, and three of them scored. Tim Anderson led off with a single to right field and went to second on a single to center by Cabrera. Abreu made it three singles in a row, scoring Anderson with the first run and moving Cabrera to third. Avisail Garcia got hit by a pitch to load the bases. Todd Frazier's grounder to third baseman Jose Ramirez was turned into a forceout at home, retiring Cabrera. Matt Davidson singled to left field, scoring Abreu and Garcia. In the second inning, Leury Garcia hit a fly ball into the left field corner that Michael Brantley dropped for a three-base error. Garcia scored on a single by Cabrera to make it 4-0. Holmberg held Cleveland scoreless on one hit through the first three innings. In the fourth, Brantley led off with a double. One out later, Encarnacion hit his second two-run homer in as many nights, a line drive over the left field wall for his 12th homer of the season to cut the Chicago lead to 4-2.  We didn't get much going, other than the home runs,  Francona said. Renteria brought Robertson into the game in the eighth to pitch to the top of the Cleveland lineup, then allowed the closer to pitch the ninth inning as well.  I wanted to put our best guy out there,  said Renteria, whose team had lost eight of its last nine games, and desperately needed a win. It was the second two-inning save of Robertson's career, the other coming Sept. 3, 2011, as a member of the Yankees.

Group of Seven (G7) environment ministers and officials are meeting in Bologna on Sunday and Monday to discuss issues ranging from climate change to sustainable development and litter at sea. But earlier this month U.S. President Donald Trump said he would withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, drawing condemnation from other world leaders.  Positions over the Paris accord are far apart ... and will remain that way,  Italian Environment Minister Gian Luca Galletti said on the sidelines of the meeting.  Italy holds the G7 presidency for 2017. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni have said the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, urging their allies to speed up efforts to combat global warming. German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks said all seven countries had agreed on the need to take action but disappointment had been expressed at the U.S. decision to leave the Paris Accord.  There will be a final comuniqué tomorrow that will differentiate opinions,  she said, without providing details. Trump has said the Paris accord would undermine the U.S. economy, cost jobs, and put the country at a permanent disadvantage compared with its competitors.

I believe engaging in international discussion is of the utmost importance to the United States when it comes to environmental issues,  he said in the statement. According to Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Pruitt told delegates in the opening session that the United States wanted to continue making efforts in combating climate change.

Trump said when he announced he was pulling out of the Paris accord that his administration would begin negotiations either to re-enter the deal or set up a new agreement on  terms that are fair to the United States . Italy's Galletti said the United States was looking to take the climate change debate forward on a voluntary basis while Paris was a multilateral accord requiring monitoring, deadlines and transparency.  That's a substantial difference,  he said. The United States is the world's second biggest carbon emitter behind China.

Cheering spectators packed sidewalks as floats with rainbow balloons and papier mache rainbows snaked 1.5 miles (2.4 km) through residential neighborhoods several blocks north of the White House. In almost 90 Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) heat, some men went shirtless or donned feather boas. Protesters who oppose the Capital Pride parade's corporate backing, which includes bank Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), briefly blocked the parade route and forced it to be rerouted. The protest group, No Justice No Pride, said in a statement that Capital Pride also needed to add a transgender minority woman to its board and bar police from marching in the parade. The Capital Pride parade was among a bevy of gay pride events this weekend scheduled for cities across the United States, including Boston, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. “We need to be out here to tell people that God loves them for who they are and who they love,” said the Rev. Alex Dyer, 38, an Episcopal priest from Washington who marched in the parade with his husband and 2-year-old daughter.

Speaking on ABC News'  This Week  in his first televised interview since Trump fired him in March as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, Bharara said he believed Trump's calls to him violated the usual boundaries between the executive branch and independent criminal investigators.  It's a very weird and peculiar thing for a one-on-one conversation without the attorney general, without warning between the president and me or any United States attorney who has been asked to investigate various things and is in a position hypothetically to investigate business interests and associates of the president,  Bharara said. He added that during President Barack Obama's tenure, Obama never called him directly. Bharara's comments came just a few days after former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey testified at a congressional panel that Trump had asked him to drop an investigation into former Trump aide Michael Flynn and his alleged ties to Russia. Comey also said he believed he was subsequently fired in an effort to undermine the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied allegations of collusion between his campaign and Russia and said he never directed Comey to drop the Flynn probe. A White House spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment. Bharara said on Sunday that Trump called him twice after the November election  ostensibly just to shoot the breeze.   It was a little bit uncomfortable, but he was not the president. He was only the president-elect,  Bharara said. The third call, however, came two days after Trump's inauguration. That time, he said, he refused to call back.  The call came in. I got a message. We deliberated over it, thought it was inappropriate to return the call. And 22 hours later I was asked to resign along with 45 other people,  he said. Bharara stopped short of saying whether he thought Trump had obstructed justice in his conversations and subsequent firing of Comey. However, he said he thought there was  absolutely evidence to begin a case  into the matter. Reporting by Sarah N.

Even so, Oscar Lopez Rivera still wanted to march in the annual celebration of Puerto Rican heritage, said Louis Maldonado, a member of the parade's board. This year was the first opportunity he had to do so since being released from prison after serving 35 years on sedition charges.  “The reality is we did not convince him to do that. This was his decision. His decision alone,  Maldonado told WABC-TV when asked if organizers bowed to political pressure by dropping plans to give Lopez Rivera a  National Freedom Hero  award.  He did so because he saw the level of divisiveness that was happening in our community,  Maldonado said. As the parade marched up Fifth Avenue on Sunday morning, there was little sign of the firestorm of criticism that has surrounded the event since organizers announced their plans.       Thousands of cheering spectators lined the route, many of them waving small Puerto Rican flags. The crowd applauded wildly as Lopez Rivera, 74, rode past on a colorful float decorated with leaping fish. He gave a  thumbs up  and thrust a clenched fist in the air. Organizers expected 1.5 million to watch Sunday's event, held the same day as the U.S. territory holds a referendum on statehood. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was among the public figures who decided against marching in the parade once it was known Lopez Rivera was being considered as the honoree. New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the nation's largest police union, called for a boycott of the annual celebration by Americans with roots on the Caribbean island, home to 3.5 million residents.  JetBlue Airways Corp, AT&T; Inc and other major advertisers pulled their sponsorships over Lopez Rivera's participation.  I think it's good that he declined it because it was entirely distracting from the issue at hand, which is Puerto Rico,  Mayor Bill de Blasio, who planned to march all along, said last week.  That’s the only thing this parade should have been about.  In 1981, Lopez Rivera was convicted of sedition and other charges, along with other members of the Armed Forces of National Liberation, known by its Spanish-language acronym as FALN. U.S. authorities said the group was responsible for dozens of bombings in the 1970s and 1980s in a campaign to secure Puerto Rico's independence.  Lopez Rivera, who was sentenced to 55 years in prison, plus 15 additional years for a foiled escape plot, was freed in January during President Barack Obama's final days in office.   Lopez Rivera's supporters, including  Hamilton  playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and other celebrities, view him as a symbol of Puerto Rican nationalism and the campaign to end what they see as the colonial status of the U.S. territory, acquired by the United States after the Spanish-American War. Critics of the decision to honor Rivera say he is a convicted criminal who helped carry out the 1975 bombing of New York's Fraunces Tavern and other deadly attacks. No one was ever charged in connection with that bombing. After Lopez Rivera declined the award, City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito said publicly she would find a way to honor him at the parade. Currently, Puerto Rico is struggling with $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and critically underfunded healthcare and pension systems. A federal oversight board appointed by U.S. Congress is managing its finances.  Against that backdrop, Puerto Ricans on Sunday will cast votes on whether their struggling island should become the 51st U.S. state. Even if islanders vote in favor of statehood in the referendum, Puerto Rico's fifth since 1967, statehood would require an act of the U.S. Congress.

Judge started a six-run bottom of the first inning and came within a triple of the cycle as the Yankees rolled to a 16-3 rout of the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday night. The towering right fielder started New York's most prolific scoring output since April 6, 2016 against Houston by hitting his major league-leading 19th homer with two outs in the first off Chris Tillman.

Every starter had at least a hit and six starters recorded multi-hit games for the Yankees, who have scored 41 runs in their last four games and have hit at least three homers in four straight games, upping their season total to 98.  A win is a win because it's good when you're swinging the bats like we are because it takes some pressure off your pitching staff and you feel like you always have an opportunity to win games when you're scoring runs but you don't get more points for it,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  But it's great to see everyone swinging the bat and we want it to continue.  The offense almost became somewhat of an afterthought as Luis Severino (5-2) retired the first 12 hitters and pitched 4 1/3 hitless innings. He lost his perfect game bid by walking Mark Trumbo to start the fifth and lost the no-hit bid by allowing a single to Trey Mancini two batters later. Chris Davis and Joey Rickard homered for the Orioles, who lost for the 13th time in 19 games. Pinch-hitter Caleb Joseph added a ninth-inning RBI single that ended an 0-for-45 stretch for opponents with runners in scoring position against New York.  I'm not going to fault our guys, especially when you get down,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  It knocks a lot of air out of your sails.  Severino allowed one run and two hits in seven innings. He struck out eight and won his third straight decision. Tillman was tagged for a career-high nine runs and seven hits in 1 1/3 innings. It was his shortest start since also lasting 1 1/3 innings June 21, 2015 at Toronto and he has a 31.50 ERA in two starts against New York this season.  Bad execution, real poor execution,  Tillman said.  It felt like we got two quick outs and we were in such a hurry to get the breaking stuff going that it kind of snowballed real quick. It was bad execution.  After Judge's latest homer, Sanchez made it 3-0 with a single to left field, and Gregorius extended the lead to 5-0 by hitting a first-pitch fastball into the right-field seats. After a walk to Chase Headley and a wild pitch, Carter capped the inning with a single to left. The Yankees saw 11 straight pitches out of the strike zone in the second before adding to their lead. After walks to Judge and Holliday, Castro made it 9-0 by driving a 3-0 fastball into the left-center field bleachers. New York made it 12-0 before an out was recorded in the fourth. After Aaron Hicks walked and Judge singled, Holliday hit a 1-0 pitch from Stefan Crichton into the right-field seats. The Yankees extended the lead to 14-0 with one out in the fifth when Judge lined a double to left field off Edwin Jackson and added their final runs in the eighth when Sanchez homered off Mike Wright. NOTES: Baltimore 3B Manny Machado missed his third straight game with a sore left wrist, but manager Buck Showalter said he is feeling better and it appears Machado avoided going on the DL. ... New York LHP Aroldis Chapman threw 18 pitches in a one-inning simulated game and manager Joe Girardi said he will make at least two rehab appearances next week. ... LHP Zach Britton (strained left forearm) threw a 25-pitch bullpen session Saturday. He will increase it to 35 pitches Monday and throw live batting practice Thursday. ... New York 1B Greg Bird (bruised right ankle) was 2-for-5 in a rehab game with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre. ... After the game, the Yankees announced RHP Chad Green will start Sunday's game. Green said he found out he was getting the start during the ninth inning. After the game, the Yankees announced LHP Tommy Layne was designated for assignment and RHP Domingo German will be recalled from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre on Sunday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-orioles-yankees-writethru-idUSMTZED6BDZHND8"},

G7 environment ministers and officials are meeting in Bologna on Sunday and Monday to discuss issues including climate change, sustainable development and litter at sea.  Positions over the Paris accord are far apart ... and will remain like that,  Galletti said on the sidelines of a meeting of G7 environment ministers from the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Britain. Italy holds the G7 presidency for 2017. Scott Pruitt, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief, was called back to Washington from the G7 to attend President Donald Trump's first full cabinet meeting on Monday. Pruitt said in March he did not believe carbon dioxide was a primary contributor to global warming, Trump said this month he would withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, drawing condemnation from other world leaders. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni have said the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, urging their allies to speed up efforts to combat climate change.  There's a willingness to find a common thread. ... We're looking to mend things,  Galletti told reporters, without providing details. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, has said the Paris accord would undermine the U.S. economy, cost jobs, and put the country at a permanent disadvantage compared to its competitors. Pruitt said in a statement later on Sunday that the United States had always been a world leader on environmental stewardship and  that was demonstrated on a global stage today.  According to Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Pruitt told delegates that Washington wanted to continue making efforts in combating climate change.  He also mentioned he wants to engage with the (UN's) Climate Change secretariat,  she said. Trump has said that his administration would begin negotiations either to re-enter the Paris deal or set up a new agreement on  terms that are fair to the United States,  which is the world's second biggest carbon emitter behind China. Supporters of the Paris accord have called Trump's move a blow to international efforts to tackle dangers of global warming.

While now world number one Johnson won in 2016 and then world number one Jordan Spieth triumphed in 2015, it would hardly surprise if this year threw up a more unlikely champion at Erin Hills in Wisconsin. Making a prediction even more fraught with danger is that most of the favourites have at least a question mark hovering over them, while other players have claimed most of the recent victories on the PGA Tour. Consider that American Johnson, who missed the U.S. Masters after hurting his back on tournament eve, failed to make the halfway at the Memorial tournament last week. Or that world number two Rory McIlroy has not played in nearly a month, since reporting back problems at the Players Championship. And the next two players in the rankings, Australian Jason Day and Japanese Hideki Matsuyama, have been quiet of late, which taken in combination is just about enough to make a professional gambler decide to throw a dart at the entry list to find a prospective winner. Erin Hills, at 7,800 yards and with four par-fives, is likely to favour power hitters, but that hardly narrows the list of prospective winners in the year's second major championship. And while good putting never goes astray, look for a great ball-striker to emerge on top. U.S. Masters champion Sergio Garcia could be tough to beat, while Spieth seems to be back in form after missing the cut at the Players Championship. Masters runner-up Justin Rose drives the ball just about as well as anyone, as does Australian Adam Scott, while South Africans Charl Schwartzel and Louis Oosthuizen are always a threat. The American threat, if not led by Johnson or Spieth, could emerge from the likes of Rickie Fowler or Kevin Kisner, while Garcia’s Spanish compatriot Jon Rahm has all the makings of a champion. Day said his game plan would be the same as ever at the U.S. Open -- eliminate single-hole disasters by avoiding unnecessary risks, find the fairway off the tee and stay in emotional control. “Get your birdies when you can. Always try and stay positive, and never think you're out of it,” he said. Those are hardly state secrets but knowing them and having the discipline to abide by them are two different things.    Patience, as much as shot execution, will be key. Those who do best at managing both will at least have a chance.

In the age of the Internet, sports fans increasingly expect to have personal insights into the lives of favourite players, especially in individual sports such as golf where competitors cannot hide behind bigger personalities on their team. Many of the players are as gifted on the links as they are on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, where they post often to build their brands, promote their sponsors and charities, and to goof off during downtime. Bubba Watson may have the most entertaining social media presence at this year's U.S. Open, where he can be expected to bolster his everyman bona fides with his hilarious posts. When the two-times Masters winner is not fulfilling every kid's childhood dream of buying the famous car from the Dukes of Hazard TV show, he is attending sporting events and geeking out in the same manner as would any fan with great seats. At the NBA Finals Game Three on Wednesday, Watson used Twitter to remind fellow golfer Jason Day to pick him up at the airport and later posted a fan photo that he took of Cleveland star LeBron James. After the game he managed to interrupt the Warriors’ Stephen Curry during the point guard's on-court TV interview, prompting the golf-loving Curry to say he would be watching Watson at the Open. The clip went viral and became social media gold. Rory McIlroy's active online presence underscores the 28-year-old witty, self-effacing sense of humour.  I hit a little white ball around a field sometimes,  he says dryly in his Twitter account bio. He also uses his account to promote the Rory Foundation, which supports children's charities, and this week posted a video asking fans to submit their best trick shot videos for a chance to play in the pro-am at the Irish Open in July. Rickie Fowler's Instagram gives fans a glimpse into the good life of the rich and famous, including photos of private planes, expensive cars and selfies with Tiger Woods. Fowler and fellow American Jordan Spieth did not look too upset about not winning the Masters this year, posting photos and videos to Snapchat enjoying themselves on a yacht in the Bahamas with fellow golfers Justin Thomas and Smylie Kaufman after the tournament. Justin Rose, the 2013 U.S. Open champion from England, uses his Twitter account to promote his sponsors to his more than 800,000 followers. Not everyone's personality translates online, of course. Defending champion Dustin Johnson can be electric on the course but his online posts tend to underwhelm.  Had a good couple of practice rounds at Erin Hills and really like the course,  Johnson tweeted on Monday.  Looking forward to defending next week.

(Reuters) - A high-flying science experiment may color the skies above the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast with bluish green and red clouds on Sunday evening, as NASA seeks to learn more about charged particles at the top of Earth's atmosphere. A small rocket carrying 10 canisters of barium and other chemicals is due to lift off from Wallops Island, Virginia between 9:04 and 9:19 p.m. EDT. About five minutes after launch the canisters, which are about the size of soda cans, will release blue-green and red vapors that will gather into artificial clouds potentially visible from New York to North Carolina.  The luminescent colors are due to sunlight interacting with the chemicals barium, strontium and cupric-oxide, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration said on its website. Although the flight will last about eight minutes, the colorful clouds could linger for 20 minutes, depending on atmospheric conditions. NASA ground stations at Wallops Island and Duck, N.C., will track the clouds so scientists can learn more Earth's ionosphere, a layer at the top of the atmosphere of charged particles that shoot out into space, creating effects including auroral displays over the planet's polar regions. Scientists want to learn more about how the ionosphere interacts with other layers of the atmosphere.  The ionosphere is both shaped by waves from the atmosphere below and uniquely responsive to the changing conditions in space,  NASA said. Sunday's launch will be delayed if skies are not clear over at least one of the tracking sites, NASA said. The launch could be rescheduled for any time between this week and June 18.

The move comes as Canyon Bridge seeks to get the deal approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel which reviews corporate acquisitions for potential national security risks. The standard CFIUS review lasts for up to 75 days. Canyon Bridge submitted the deal for CFIUS review in January and refiled it in March. Refiling with CFIUS resets the clock and provides up to another 75 days for review.  Canyon Bridge has been seeking to convince CFIUS that it will run Lattice without influence from the Chinese state, the sources said. Several U.S. lawmakers expressed concerns about the deal after Reuters reported last year that Canyon Bridge is funded by cash originating from China's central government, and also has indirect links to its space program.  Few deals have ever filed for CFIUS review three times. However, vacancies left in senior positions at several government agencies, almost five months after the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, have reduced CFIUS' capacity to review cases expeditiously, and are weighing on its decision-making ability, the sources said. Canyon Bridge and Lattice are hoping that some key government appointments in the coming weeks, such as that of Heath Tarbert, who has been nominated as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international markets and development, will help resolve the impasse with CFIUS, one of the sources added.  The sources asked not to be identified because the CFIUS review process is confidential. Portland, Oregon-based Lattice declined to comment, while Canyon Bridge and a CFIUS spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lattice shares closed at $6.86 on Friday, about 17 percent below the $8.30 per share in cash that Lattice shareholders stand to receive if the company's sale goes through, underscoring the uncertainty over the deal's prospects. Time is running out to complete the deal. Canyon Bridge's and Lattice's agreement has an Aug. 1 deadline for the deal to close, and the acquisition cannot be completed without CFIUS clearance. The two companies would have to negotiate an extension to the deal deadline if the CFIUS review has not been completed by then. Cfius Delays In a further sign of strains in the CFIUS system, U.S. electronics maker Inseego Corp (INSG.O) said earlier this month it had scrapped a $50-million deal, clinched last September, to sell its MiFi mobile hotspot business to Chinese smartphone maker TCL Industries Holdings, citing  delays and uncertainty in securing (CFIUS) approval.  Like Canyon Bridge is about to do, TCL had refiled for CFIUS review twice. Proponents of U.S. openness to foreign investment fret that CFIUS may become a tool of economic protectionism as a result of Trump's  America first  policy agenda. However, it is not yet clear what broader stance CFIUS will take towards Chinese acquirers under Trump, who has criticized Chinese trade practices but is also looking for Chinese cooperation in tackling North Korea's nuclear ambitions.  There are some technical issues and some technical changes that we are working on legislative fixes for CFIUS, but I would say fundamentally we want to keep CFIUS as a national security review, and we want to deal with economic issues separately,  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at forum on China in Washington, D.C. earlier this month.  The semiconductor industry has long been seen as one of the most sensitive sectors from a U.S. national security perspective, because it provides chips for a plethora of applications and devices, from smartphones and satellites to missiles and power grids.  Lattice, whose chips are used in smartphones, laptops and televisions, has said it does not design or manufacture military-grade products, and that its small sales to the military pertain to general-purpose parts without advanced applications. It has also stressed that it does not have any factories that can be compromised, because all of its manufacturing is outsourced. To help launch Canyon Bridge as a U.S.-based fund, its founder Benjamin Chow last year tapped Cypress Semiconductor Corp (CY.O) executive chairman Ray Bingham as his partner. Bingham now faces a shareholder campaign to remove him from the board of Cypress over potential conflicts of interest associated with his participation in Canyon Bridge, which he has denied. Another important test case for China's ability to acquire U.S. semiconductor companies will be Xcerra Corp (XCRA.O). China-based semiconductor investment fund Unic Capital Management agreed to acquire Xcerra Corp for $580 million in cash in April. Norwood, Massachusetts-based Xcerra does not make chips like Lattice, but designs and manufactures equipment to test semiconductors and circuit boards. Were CFIUS to block the deal, it would illustrate how high the U.S. regulatory bar is for Chinese acquirers. Reporting by Liana B.

The Rainguard Water Sealers 600 ended under caution with only nine cars running. Tony Kanaan finished second and Simon Pagenaud was third. The race ended under caution after Indianapolis 500 champion Takuma Sato made contact with Scott Dixon. There was one big crash earlier in the race as the cars ran in one pack. Three cars were side by side approaching Turn 3 when it appeared Kanaan, who was on the bottom, moved up and made contact with James Hinchcliffe. Hinchcliffe's car then bounced off Mikhail Aleshin's and that started a chain reaction that collected Tristan Vautier, rookie Ed Jones, Ed Carpenter, JR Hildebrand, Carlos Munoz and Ryan Hunter-Reay. No one was injured. Kanaan was penalized for blocking and avoidable contact. In serving the penalty, Kanaan fell two laps off the pace, but he made them up because of several mandatory cautions as IndyCar tried to manage increased tire wear. On Lap 37, Alexander Rossi found himself in the middle of Dixon and Kanaan approaching Turn 3. Rossi lost control, spinning relatively slowly toward the outside wall. Contact ensued, knocking last year's Indianapolis 500 winner out of the race. He was not injured. More action followed on the pit stop under caution. Hinchcliffe spun near the exit of pit road, forcing contact with Helio Castroneves and Sato. Neither Castroneves nor Sato suffered much car damage and were able to make repairs without losing a lap. Hinchcliffe wasn't so fortunate. He was flagged for avoidable contact, necessitating a drive-through pit road as his penalty. That cost him a lap to the field. After serving the penalty, Hinchcliffe came storming through the field, getting to the back of the lead car. It was then that the caution came out for Castroneves' crash in Turn 2, and in the cycle of stops that ensued Hinchcliffe got his lap back. Castroneves wasn't injured. On the restart, Carpenter had light contact with Vautier on the front straightaway. Carpenter made a long spin toward Turn 1 and saved it. All cars trailing him avoided contact. On Lap 200, Josef Newgarden tried to go three-wide in Turn 4, and that didn't work. He lost control and somehow kept the car close to the wall and those trailing avoided hitting him. NOTES: Charlie Kimball won the first pole of his IndyCar Series career, edging Ganassi Racing teammate Scott Dixon, but his run at the top lasted only 28 laps. Soon after relinquishing the lead to Tristan Vautier, Kimball's Honda began leaking oil. During the pit stop after Alexander Rossi's crash, a significant amount of oil dropped in the pit box and the crew was forced to push the car behind the wall. Vautier was subbing for the injured Sebastien Bourdais, who crashed last month in qualifying at Indy. ... After five consecutive weeks of competition, including three weeks at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, IndyCar is due for an off weekend. The next race is June 25 at the Road America circuit in Elkhart Lake, Wis.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/car-nascar-grandnational-writethru-idUSMTZED6BDZJNF3"},

He was released in the town of Zintan under an amnesty law passed by a parliament based in eastern Libya, lawyer Khaled al-Zaidi said on Sunday, adding that Saif was headed to another Libyan city that he could not name for security reasons. Saif, 44, is the most prominent of the late leader's children, and was touted by some as a reformist successor before the uprising six years ago in which Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed. It is unclear what, if any, role the younger Gaddafi could play in Libya, where a complex array of armed groups and competing governments are vying for control.  But Gaddafi loyalists outside Libya as well as some in the east of the country, where military commander Khalifa Haftar has been building power, have been pressing for Saif's release amid a push from former regime figures to reassert influence.  Saif's lawyer Zaidi said Saif could play an important part in national reconciliation efforts because he was popular in Libya:  He will play a pivotal and detailed role in this stage.  Zaidi told Reuters in an interview in Cairo that Saif would make a statement at some point and would not be turning himself in to the International Criminal Court, which is seeking his arrest. Earlier reports that Saif had been freed from Zintan turned out to be false and there have long been conflicting rumors about his status. No physical evidence of his whereabouts has been offered. Saif was last seen by an independent international observer in June 2014. Zintan's Abubaker Sadiq brigade, which was responsible for guarding Saif, said it had chosen to release him following requests from the justice ministry of a government based in eastern Libya that is a rival to the U.N.-backed one in the capital, Tripoli.

Sentenced to Death A Tripoli court sentenced Saif to death in absentia in 2015 for war crimes, including killing protesters during the revolution. A statement posted by the attorney general's office in Tripoli on Sunday said he was still wanted under that conviction and that an investigation had been launched into his reported release.  Slideshow (4 Images)Libya slid into turmoil after Muammar Gaddafi's overthrow, with rival governments and armed alliances competing for power. A U.N.-backed government in Tripoli has struggled to impose its authority and has been rejected by factions in the east. Zintan, which gained military importance through its role in the 2011 uprising and has been at odds with authorities in Tripoli, had refused to hand Saif over. He is also sought by the International Criminal Court, which says his trial in Libya did not meet international standards. It was unclear what terms Saif's captors might have set for his release, and why they would have freed a prisoner seen as a major bargaining chip. Zintan, about 145 km (90 miles) southwest of Tripoli, has its own divisions, but has been broadly aligned with the government and armed forces based in eastern Libya. However, a statement from Zintan's military and municipal councils strongly condemned the Abubaker Sadiq brigade's decision to release Saif. It said the move had  nothing to do with legal procedures, but is collusion and betrayal of the blood of the martyrs and the military institution that they claim to belong to . The defense and security committee of the eastern parliament criticized the move as well, showing that opinion among officials in the east is also split.

The shooting occurred in the Achin district of Nangarhar province, where U.S. special forces have been fighting alongside Afghan troops against Islamic State and Taliban militants, said Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the Nangarhar provincial governor. The Afghan soldier was killed in the incident, Khogyani said.    The cause of the shooting is not clear. An investigation has already begun,  he said. A Pentagon statement confirmed that three U.S. soldiers had been killed in eastern Afghanistan and one wounded soldier had been evacuated for medical treatment. The statement provided no further details of the incident but said it was under investigation.  Related CoverageThree U.S. soldiers killed in eastern Afghanistan attack: U.S. officialsOne U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that the incident was a  green-on-blue  attack by a member of the Afghan security forces in Nangarhar province.  So-called  green-on-blue  insider attacks by Afghan soldiers on international service members were a major problem several years ago, but now occur less frequently after security measures were improved and the number of foreign troops in the country fell sharply. In March, three U.S. soldiers were wounded when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them. The attack comes as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration weighs an increase in troops in the war-torn country.  Reuters reported in late April that Trump's administration was carrying out a review of Afghanistan and conversations are revolving around sending between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. and coalition troops to Afghanistan. Deliberations include giving more authority to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters. This could allow U.S. advisers to work with Afghan troops below the corps level, potentially putting them closer to fighting, a U.S. official said. Earlier this year, the top U.S. intelligence official said the security situation in Afghanistan will further deteriorate even if there is a modest increase in U.S. military support for Afghanistan. In some cases Afghan troops have been forced to abandon more scattered and rural bases, and the government can claim to control or influence only 57 percent of the country, according to U.S. military estimates from earlier this year. U.S. and Afghan troops have been battling militants in the Nangarhar province for months. Islamic State, or Daesh as it is generally known in Afghanistan, has established a stronghold in the region, which borders Pakistan. U.S. military officials estimate there are about 600 to 800 Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan, mostly in Nangarhar, but also in the neighboring province of Kunar. A White House spokesman said Trump was  following the emerging situation in Afghanistan  where the soldiers were killed.   Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the shooter was a member of the militant group and had killed four Americans and wounded several more.

The Warner Bros. and DC Comics standalone will have earned $57.2 million from 4,165 theaters by the end of its second weekend, putting it solidly in first place. That's only a 45% drop from its opening weekend, giving the film an estimated $205 million domestically in two weekends. The Gal Gadot-starrer will also make more during its second frame than did both  Suicide Squad  and  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,  despite those films having larger opening weekends than  Wonder Woman  ($133.7 million for  Suicide Squad  and $166 million for  Batman v Superman ). Unlike those two films, Patty Jenkins' has critical support -- a current 93% on Rotten Tomatoes. Universal's  The Mummy,  meanwhile is counting on a strong overseas total to make up for less impressive domestic earnings. As of Sunday morning, the film is eyeing $32.2 million from 4,035 locations. That's a slow start for the film intended to launch an extended universe of monster-related titles. Overseas it looks to fare better with $141.8 million, lifting its anticipated global take to $174 million.  We would love to see more gross domestically,  said Nick Carpou, Universal's president of domestic distribution, who asserted that  a lot of the attention that 'The Mummy' garnered here, aggregated to the international total.  Carpou cited the 75-foot-tall sarcophagus unveiled at the intersection of Hollywood and Highland, and the movie's VR experience as potential buzz generators. Alex Kurtzman directed  The Mummy,  a revival of the franchise spawned by Universal's 1932 original and re-popularized by Stephen Sommers' 1999 fright-fest starring Brendan Fraser, and the three other Mummy films that followed. In the 2017 update, Cruise plays a freelance treasure hunter who resurrects a princess (Sofia Boutella). Annabelle Wallis, Jake Johnson, Courtney B. Vance, and Russell Crowe are also in the mix.  The Mummy  was announced as the kick-off to a  Dark Universe  of monster movies. 2014's  Dracula Untold,  it turns out, is not canon. The studio that was built on classics including  Dracula,   The Wolf Man,  and  Frankenstein  has already slated a  Bride of Frankenstein  movie for 2019 with half a dozen or so others in the works.  Every movie is it's own DNA,  Duncan Clark, Universal's president of international distribution commented about the  Dark Universe.   It's not about which one went first.  Clark said  Bride of Frankenstein  is on deck, and there are  others in place.  Cruise mostly recently opened  Jack Reacher: Never Go Back  to a $22.9 million domestic opening,  Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation  to $55.5 million, and  Edge of Tomorrow  to $28.9 million. Cruise with reunite with  Edge  director Doug Liman for Universal's  American Made.  The studio dropped the trailer for the crime-centric action biopic on Monday, presumably a strategic move to get audiences excited about its star. But that couldn't save  The Mummy  from having the lowest domestic opening of any in the recent iteration of the franchise -- 1999's  The Mummy,  ($43.3 million); 2001's  The Mummy Returns,  ($68.1 million); 2002's  The Scorpion King,  ($36.1 million); 2008's  The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,  ($40.5 million). Rotten Tomatoes was blamed for  Baywatch's  Memorial Day weekend flop, but it wasn't enough to save two new wide releases this weekend in A24's  It Comes At Night  and Bleecker Street's  Megan Leavey.  Both films won over the critical consensus --  It Comes At Night  at 86% fresh, and  Megan Leavey  at 80% -- but are lacking so far in box office receipts. A24's horror release will scare up $6 million from 2,533, which is fine for the low price tag, but below expectations.  Leavey,  meanwhile, is earning a mere $1.9 million from 1,956, making it a complete dud. In limited release,  My Cousin Rachel  is tracking to break $1 million from 523 locations. And  Beatriz at Dinner  from Roadside Attractions is gobbling up $139,000 from only five spots. Landing in third overall,  Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie  from Fox should take in an additional $12.3 million from 3,529 locations -- that's only a 48% drop from last weekend. Disney's  Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales  will sail to fourth with an additional $10.7 million from 3,679 theaters. The franchise's fifth starring Johnny Depp now has over $600 million worldwide.  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2  will round out the top five for the weekend with $6.2 million from 2,911 locations. The studio is scaling back on domestic locations for both  Pirates  and  Guardians  by about 500 apiece.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-boxoffice-idUSKBN1920WU"},

The 50th anniversary of that conflict has rekindled memories of the event, when the flattened district's 650 Palestinians residents, mostly poor migrants, were urged to move to Shuafat, a refugee camp, or fled further, to camps in Lebanon and Jordan. But some stayed and a half-century later are determined to retain their presence in the Old City.  Israel brought buses to Damascus Gate and said people can take free rides if they wanted to quit Jerusalem,  recalls Mohammad Assawaf, now 90, who was running a bakery in the neighborhood when the Six-Day War broke out on June 5, 1967.  All those who left regretted it.  Assawaf's bakery was in the Jewish Quarter, which had been cleared of its Jewish residents by Jordanian forces when they seized the Old City and the rest of East Jerusalem in 1948, during the war that followed Israel's creation. Israel's sweeping victory nearly two decades later allowed Jews back into the Old City for the first time, and fueled the desire to reclaim all of the Jewish Quarter, including the area where the razed Arab neighborhood had taken root over the centuries. Assawaf, a father of 15 children, was forced to leave his house, which was one of those bulldozed on June 10 and 11 to make space for the marbled Western Wall plaza. But he refused to give up his nearby bakery, despite large offers of cash from Israel. FILE PHOTO: Youth hold their prayer shawls as they stand in front of the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest prayers site in Jerusalem's Old City May 17, 2017.Ronen Zvulun/File Photo I stayed in the bakery and continued to work there. They offered me 250,000 Jordanian dinars, but I refused,  he said, mentioning a sum that would have been vast at the time. Eventually Assawaf gave up the bakery, following a court battle in the 1980s, but he is still living in the Jewish Quarter, one of the few Arab residents to do so, and is determined to stay put in the place where he was born.  Jerusalem as a place did not change, but the people changed,  he said, referring to the return of Jews to the neighborhood.  Now there is occupation, life before was easier.  In Shuafat, a camp of high-rise buildings rife with poverty and unemployment, there are regrets among Palestinians who took the decision to leave the Old City. Shuafat is only around eight km (five miles) to the north, on the outskirts of Jerusalem, but it feels a world away.  Mohammad Ali, 77, grew up in the Jewish Quarter when it was empty of Jewish residents. But in the immediate aftermath of the 1967 war, he decided to leave, thinking life would improve.  I left my heart and my life in the Old City,  he said. Mohammad Abu Znaid was 10 years old when the 1967 war erupted. When Israeli troops seized the Old City, he and his family were forced to flee the Jewish Quarter, he said. They walked barefoot to Shuafat, a journey he regrets.  We are today living in a refugee camp, you can say fatherless and motherless,  he said, using a term to suggest that there is no support or sense of belonging.

The Warner Bros. and DC Comics standalone will have earned $57.2 million from 4,165 theaters by the end of its second weekend, putting it solidly in first place. That's only a 45% drop from its opening weekend, giving the film an estimated $205 million domestically in two weekends. The Gal Gadot-starrer will also make more during its second frame than did both  Suicide Squad  and  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,  despite those films having larger opening weekends than  Wonder Woman  ($133.7 million for  Suicide Squad  and $166 million for  Batman v Superman ). Unlike those two films, Patty Jenkins' has critical support -- a current 93% on Rotten Tomatoes. Universal's  The Mummy,  meanwhile is counting on a strong overseas total to make up for less impressive domestic earnings. As of Sunday morning, the film is eyeing $32.2 million from 4,035 locations. That's a slow start for the film intended to launch an extended universe of monster-related titles. Overseas it looks to fare better with $141.8 million, lifting its anticipated global take to $174 million.  We would love to see more gross domestically,  said Nick Carpou, Universal's president of domestic distribution, who asserted that  a lot of the attention that 'The Mummy' garnered here, aggregated to the international total.  Carpou cited the 75-foot-tall sarcophagus unveiled at the intersection of Hollywood and Highland, and the movie's VR experience as potential buzz generators. Alex Kurtzman directed  The Mummy,  a revival of the franchise spawned by Universal's 1932 original and re-popularized by Stephen Sommers' 1999 fright-fest starring Brendan Fraser, and the three other Mummy films that followed. In the 2017 update, Cruise plays a freelance treasure hunter who resurrects a princess (Sofia Boutella). Annabelle Wallis, Jake Johnson, Courtney B. Vance, and Russell Crowe are also in the mix.  The Mummy  was announced as the kick-off to a  Dark Universe  of monster movies. 2014's  Dracula Untold,  it turns out, is not canon. The studio that was built on classics including  Dracula,   The Wolf Man,  and  Frankenstein  has already slated a  Bride of Frankenstein  movie for 2019 with half a dozen or so others in the works.  Every movie is it's own DNA,  Duncan Clark, Universal's president of international distribution commented about the  Dark Universe.   It's not about which one went first.  Clark said  Bride of Frankenstein  is on deck, and there are  others in place.  Cruise mostly recently opened  Jack Reacher: Never Go Back  to a $22.9 million domestic opening,  Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation  to $55.5 million, and  Edge of Tomorrow  to $28.9 million. Cruise with reunite with  Edge  director Doug Liman for Universal's  American Made.  The studio dropped the trailer for the crime-centric action biopic on Monday, presumably a strategic move to get audiences excited about its star. But that couldn't save  The Mummy  from having the lowest domestic opening of any in the recent iteration of the franchise -- 1999's  The Mummy,  ($43.3 million); 2001's  The Mummy Returns,  ($68.1 million); 2002's  The Scorpion King,  ($36.1 million); 2008's  The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,  ($40.5 million). Rotten Tomatoes was blamed for  Baywatch's  Memorial Day weekend flop, but it wasn't enough to save two new wide releases this weekend in A24's  It Comes At Night  and Bleecker Street's  Megan Leavey.  Both films won over the critical consensus --  It Comes At Night  at 86% fresh, and  Megan Leavey  at 80% -- but are lacking so far in box office receipts. A24's horror release will scare up $6 million from 2,533, which is fine for the low price tag, but below expectations.  Leavey,  meanwhile, is earning a mere $1.9 million from 1,956, making it a complete dud. In limited release,  My Cousin Rachel  is tracking to break $1 million from 523 locations. And  Beatriz at Dinner  from Roadside Attractions is gobbling up $139,000 from only five spots. Landing in third overall,  Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie  from Fox should take in an additional $12.3 million from 3,529 locations -- that's only a 48% drop from last weekend. Disney's  Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales  will sail to fourth with an additional $10.7 million from 3,679 theaters. The franchise's fifth starring Johnny Depp now has over $600 million worldwide.  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2  will round out the top five for the weekend with $6.2 million from 2,911 locations. The studio is scaling back on domestic locations for both  Pirates  and  Guardians  by about 500 apiece.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-boxoffice-idUSL1N1J808C"},

With the mainstream left Social Democrats (SPD) part of a grand coalition with Angela Merkel's conservatives, the Linke is currently Germany's biggest opposition party and is on 8-11 percent in the latest polls. The party is hoping for a Corbyn-style surge to help boost its share of the vote and make it a potential player in an alternative coalition after the national election on Sept. 24. Party co-leader Katja Kipping told Reuters she was encouraged by Corbyn's  magnificent catch-up race  after he entered the campaign far behind the Conservatives, especially as his ideas such as redistributing wealth mirrored Linke themes.  He showed you can score a lot of points with a modern election campaign, doorstep visits and a social program that's very similar to ours,  the 39-year-old said in an interview at a party congress in the northern city of Hanover. Corbyn, whose party denied the Conservatives an outright victory, struck a chord with young voters and made clever use of social media in a campaign that had echoes of Democrat Bernie Sanders' bid to run for the U.S. presidency last year. Linke co-chairman Bernd Riexinger, a 61-year-old former trade union leader, whipped up around 580 delegates with a speech saying Corbyn showed the unexpected could happen despite polls showing Merkel as the clear favorite to win another term.  The election isn't over yet unless we believe the prophets who say so. Merkel and her politics can be ousted!  he said to thunderous applause at a conference taking place under the slogan  Social. Fair. For Everyone . Troubled Relationship With Spd The Linke, which campaigns for wealth to be redistributed, wants NATO replaced with a new body including Russia and opposes German military combat missions, is aiming for at least 10 percent of the vote. But Manfred Guellner, head of Forsa polling institute, said its support had leveled off at around 8 percent and  its potential is not much bigger than that . Top candidates of Germany's left-wing party Die Linke Sahra Wagenknecht and Dietmar Bartsch and party co-leaders Katja Kipping and Bernd Riexinger receive applause during a party congress in Hanover, Germany, June 11, 2017.Michelle MartinAn anti-Communist tradition in post-war western Germany makes it hard for the Linke -- formed in 2007 from SPD defectors and the successor party to East Germany's Communists -- to gain ground in the West. Older people nostalgic for the Communist days in East Germany are dying out, Guellner said. With Merkel still popular and the German economy faring well, voters are likely to be reluctant to support the Linke and its social justice message - a problem also faced by the SPD, which has slumped in recent polls, he added. The Linke is dependent on the SPD, with which it has a troubled relationship, if it wants to get into power. The SPD has not ruled out a three-way alliance also involving the Greens, a change from 2013 when the constellation was mathematically possible but the political will was absent. Slideshow (4 Images)Kipping urged the Linke not to limit itself to being in opposition, which some members favor. The party takes reassurance from the interest shown by young voters in left-wing policies. It says it has gained 3,000 new members this year and of those 58 percent are under age 35.  That's not comparable with Sanders and Corbyn but it is at least a small plant that we should water,  Dietmar Bartsch, a 59-year-old economist from the former Communist East who is one of the Linke's two lead candidates, said in an interview. Sahra Wagenknecht, the party's 47-year-old firebrand co-lead candidate, said a sharp rise in support for the SPD earlier this year when it began focusing on social justice under new leader Martin Schulz showed people wanted a change in policy but Schulz's proposals had since disappointed his supporters. She told Reuters the Linke plans to win young voters over by launching a  very rebellious campaign . But Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University, said it was hard to see the Linke enjoying the same success as Corbyn, France's Jean-Luc Melenchon or Sanders as it does not have a charismatic figurehead. Linke members shrug off the skeptics.  We shouldn't let people who try to tell us it's unrealistic drive us crazy,  said Bartsch.

The pro-European ruling coalition has been seeking to change the voting system in time for a parliamentary election next year, when its parties will be in a tough fight with pro-Moscow rivals who reject closer integration with Europe. Chanting  We will not surrender! , some 4,000 protesters gathered in central Chisinau, appealing to the Venice Commission, the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and the United States to prevent the changes coming into force.  On June 16, the Venice Commission, a body that rules on rights and democracy disputes in Europe, is due to consider whether to accept a study by external experts which says the new system could be susceptible to undue influence by political or business interests, according to a draft opinion seen by Reuters. [nL8N1J30Q0] European member states of the commission are committed to respecting the commission's decisions.  At the moment, Moldova elects its parliament under a proportional representation system. The Democratic Party, to which the prime minister belongs, wants a mixed system, with some lawmakers elected, as now, on party lists, and others running in first-past-the-post constituency races. Supporters of the change say having legislators represent particular constituencies would enhance the link between parliament and voters. Opponents say it is an attempt to skew the electoral system in favor of the ruling Democratic Party. Smaller protests were held in favor of the electoral changes in northern and southern cities of the ex-Soviet nation. Moldova has seen three governments fall since 2015, after the disappearance of $1 billion from the banking system plunged the country, Europe's poorest, into political and economic chaos. Like neighboring Ukraine, Moldova has become the subject of a tug of war for influence between Russia and the West. It has a trade pact with the European Union and its government says it wants even closer integration, but President Igor Dodon, a frequent visitor to Russia, has said Moldova should focus instead on building ties with Moscow.

The report is the first indication Egypt intends to maintain some control over the uninhabited islands, whose transfer to Saudi Arabia sparked fury among many Egyptians and was declared illegal by an Egyptian court. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's government announced last year a maritime demarcation accord with Saudi Arabia, which has given billions of dollars of aid to Egypt, ceding control of the Tiran and Sanafir islands to the Gulf kingdom. Parliament on Sunday began discussions about the accord ahead of a vote, whose timing has not yet been announced.  The government submitted the report to parliament to answer questions from lawmakers who had objected to the transfer, with some arguing that ceding territory amounted to treason.  The agreement only ends (Egyptian) sovereignty and does not end the necessity of Egypt protecting this area for reasons of Egyptian and Saudi Arabian national security,  the report said. It said Egyptians would not need visas to visit and Cairo would maintain administrative control but not sovereignty over the islands, which are situated in the narrow entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba leading to Jordan and Israel. The transfer plan sparked rare street protests last year from many Egyptians, who say their country's sovereignty over the islands dates back to a treaty in 1906, before Saudi Arabia was founded.  The plan was referred to the courts - irritating Riyadh and raising tensions between two major Arab states and traditional allies.

The person briefed on the matter said the board will discuss Kalanick taking time off from the company. The discussion involved the possibility that Kalanick might return in a role  with less authority, this person said, either in a position other than CEO or as CEO with narrower responsibilities and subject to stronger oversight. The source said it is not clear that the board will make any decision to change Kalanick’s role. The board is expected to adopt a number of internal policy and management changes recommended by outside attorneys hired to investigate sexual harassment and the firm's broader culture. The outside lawyers made no recommendation about Kalanick.  An Uber spokesman had no comment. Kalanick did not immediately respond to requests for comment late on Saturday.  The meeting, which Uber has not publicized, could be a pivotal moment for the world's most valuable venture-backed private company, which has upended the tightly regulated taxi industry in many countries but has run into legal trouble with a rough-and-tumble approach to local regulations and the way it handles employees and drivers.  At the Sunday meeting, according to two people familiar with the matter, the seven voting members of Uber's board, including Kalanick, are expected to vote on recommendations made by the law firm of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, which conducted a review of the company's policies and culture. The review was launched in February after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published a blog post detailing what she described as sexual harassment and the lack of a suitable response by senior managers. Fowler now works for digital payments company Stripe.  Uber's board will likely tell employees and the public of its decisions by Tuesday, one of the sources said.  Kalanick has developed a reputation as an abrasive leader, and his approach has rubbed off on his company. The 40-year-old executive was captured on video in February berating an Uber driver.   I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,  Kalanick said in a statement following the video's release.  Uber board member Arianna Huffington said in March that Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a  scrappy entrepreneur  to be more like a  leader of a major global company.  The board has been looking for a chief operating officer to help Kalanick run the company since March. The report was prepared by Holder and partner Tammy Albarrán at Covington & Burling, which did not respond to requests for comment. It comes shortly after another law firm, Perkins Coie, submitted a separate report on sexual harassment and other employee concerns at the company.  On Tuesday, Uber responded to that report's findings by saying it had fired 20 employees for a variety of reasons, and was increasing training and adopting new policies. Uber said that report considered 215 cases encompassing sexual harassment, discrimination, unprofessional behavior, bullying and other employee complaints. Recommendations for Tighter Controls San Francisco-based Uber is valued at nearly $70 billion but has yet to turn a profit. Some of the recommendations in Holder's firm's report would force greater controls on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Kalanick have had a surprising amount of autonomy for a company with more than 12,000 employees, one person familiar with the matter said. Uber's more than 1.5 million drivers worldwide are classified as independent contractors rather than employees. Kalanick, along with two close allies, has voting control of the company.  The board's discussions come at a moment when Kalanick is facing a personal trauma: his mother died last month in a boating accident, in which his father was also badly injured. Employees and former employees interviewed by Holder's team complained about sexual and racial bias, bullying and retaliation, according to people familiar with their accounts. They said that Kalanick and his lieutenants had favorites who played by different rules than other employees, and that even those favorites were nervous that they could fall from grace, which they sometimes did. Uber declined comment on that characterization.  One of the issues that came to Holder’s team's attention, according to two people familiar with the matter, was the company’s handling of a crisis in India after one of its drivers was arrested for raping a customer. Though the man was convicted in 2015, Kalanick and other executives became convinced that the crime was a set up by a local competitor, former employees said.

The arrests come a week after diplomats condemned violence against Muslims in Sri Lanka and urged the government to uphold minority rights and freedom of religion. Earlier, legislators blamed the government for failing to stop a spate of attacks on minority Muslims. More than 20 attacks on Muslims have been recorded since April 17, including arson at Muslim-owned businesses and petrol-bomb attacks on mosques while the police said at least 16 such cases had been reported since April. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe have ordered police to uphold the law, but the violence against Muslims has not ended. Muslims, who account for around 9 percent of Sri Lanka's population of 21 million, have blamed the attacks on Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) or the  Buddhist Power Force , an organization that says the spread of Islam is a threat to Buddhism as the dominant religion. It denies any involvement.  The police was able to arrest a 32-year-old person who is directly related to four (arson) attacks,  police spokesman Priyantha Jayakody told reporters adding that all four businesses were owned by Muslims.  This person has direct links with Bodu Bala Sena organization. Since 2014, he has been associating with the Bodu Bala Sena.  Bodu Bala Sena in a statement denied its links with the recent attacks and said the organization has no membership.  We have ability to unleash terrorism, extremism and violence, but not behind (latest anti-Muslim) attacks,  CEO of the BBS Dilanthe Withanage said in a statement. Jayakody also said the police had arrested four more people including a Muslim who posted a Facebook post against Buddhism and a Tamil national who attacked a mosque. Buddhists make up about 70 percent of the population, and analysts say some hardline Buddhist organizations have been spreading hate speech against Muslims and encouraging people to boycott Muslim shops. The Buddhist groups accuse some Muslim organizations of radicalising the community and forcefully converting people to Islam and vandalizing Buddhist archaeological sites. Muslim leaders have denied the claim. In 2014, three Muslims were killed in riots stirred up hardline Buddhist groups. President Maithripala Sirisena was elected the following year after a campaign in which he promised to solve the issues faced by ethnic minority Tamils and Muslims. Churches also have faced similar attacks in the past. The government ended a full-blown 26-year civil war by defeating Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009.

Below are a list of key dates faced by May in the coming week. Monday, June 12 - Northern Ireland talks The DUP and Irish nationalists Sinn Fein are due to restart talks to form a new power-sharing government in Northern Ireland and avoid devolved power reverting to the British parliament in London for the first time in a decade.  The sides have until June 29 to secure a deal, but observers fear any concessions to the DUP by May's Conservatives could complicate the talks, deepening the region’s political crisis. - May's top team of ministers to meet May has confirmed five of her most senior ministers will remain in their pre-election roles, but has yet to announce whether there will be any changes to other jobs within her top team of ministers, known as the cabinet.  Defence Minister Michael Fallon said on Sunday the cabinet would meet  early next week . Cabinet meetings usually take place on a Tuesday but British media have reported it could meet on Monday. Tuesday, June 13 - May to meet with DUP leader Arlene Foster Discussions were held between May's Conservatives and the DUP over the weekend with a view to the Northern Irish party supporting May's minority government on key votes in parliament. Foster is due to travel to London on Tuesday to meet May to discuss the details of a possible arrangement.  - May meeting with Conservative lawmakers May is due to meet with Conservative lawmakers in parliament. The chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative lawmakers Graham Brady has said the meeting is due to take place on Tuesday but could be brought forward to Monday. British media have reported that moves were afoot within May's party to dislodge her after her election gamble - aimed at increasing her party's majority in parliament ahead of Brexit talks - backfired. A leadership contest can be triggered if 15 percent of the Conservative's 318 lawmakers write to Brady saying they no longer have confidence in May. - Parliament returns to elect speaker Parliament reconvenes following the national election to elect a speaker for the lower house, the House of Commons. Swearing in of lawmakers will then begin, and continue for the rest of the week. Thursday, June 15 - Bank of England's Mark Carney and finance minister Philip Hammond speak The two men in charge of Britain's economy deliver their annual Mansion House speech on Thursday when they are likely to try to calm businesses and investors worried by May's precarious grip on power and the uncertain outlook for the UK economy which has lost a lot of its momentum of 2016. Monday, June 19 - Brexit talks begin Talks on Britain's exit from the European Union are due to begin. May has said her government will go ahead with these discussions as planned. - State opening of parliament and Queen's Speech Parliament is due to be formally reopened. Queen Elizabeth will deliver the  Queen's Speech , setting out the government's plans for the new parliamentary session. The debate on the Queen's Speech usually lasts about five or six days. The vote at the end of this debate is considered an important symbolic test of the ability of a government to command the confidence of the House of Commons. If May can get through this vote with the help of the DUP she can continue in government. If not, the opposition Labour Party would expect to have an opportunity to put forward an alternative Queen's Speech and see if it could win the support of a majority in parliament. If neither party can command a majority in parliament for their Queen's Speech, it is likely a fresh election would be called.

However, in the year since Britain voted to leave the European Union, the other 27 EU states have hardened their common position and narrowed British options for avoiding a  hard Brexit . The following scenarios touch on what may happen now voters have dashed May's hopes for a bigger majority to negotiate and left her dependent on pro-Brexit Ulster Protestants and on political rivals reportedly eyeing their moment to oust her. 1. Hard, Smooth Brexit May, a former supporter of EU membership, filed for divorce in March, meaning Britain would leave the single market and customs union and end EU court oversight, EU budget payments and free migration from the EU to Britain. After a transition period, May wants an EU-UK free trade pact. Under Article 50 of the EU treaty, Britain will no longer be a member on March 30, 2019, whether or not the two sides agree a deal to avoid leaving businesses and citizens in a legal limbo. The EU priority is  damage control  by limiting the economic disruption and saving the Union. That would curb discord and any further breakaways by showing Britain was no better off out. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has instructions to seek a deal that preserves the rights of 3 million EU citizens in Britain, recovers money owed by London (possibly $65 billion) and limits any damage to Irish peace from a  hard  EU-UK land border. If  significant progress  is made on that, EU leaders may then open talks on a transition to a free trade agreement. In this ideal scenario for Brussels, the outline divorce is set by the end of this year, agreed in full by late 2018 and ratified by lawmakers by March 2019. There would then be several years of transition to a new treaty, even deeper than a trade pact with Canada, plus close cooperation on security and science. BUT...Brussels hoped May would win a big majority to help her sell compromises needed for this scenario. Some EU officials now doubt she can remain in power if she accepts too many European demands. 2. Hard Brexit With No Deal May has said  no deal is better than a bad deal . BUT...EU leaders think she is bluffing because no deal would spell economic and legal chaos. Yet EU officials have grown increasingly worried that both sides may box themselves in, with little time left. Before the election, May and her ministers said they would not pay the EU billions on leaving and want trade talks now. Barnier, meanwhile, cannot stray from his mandate without a new, unanimous agreement of the 27. While neither side of the negotiations wants potentially chaotic limbo, a breakdown could leave both with a messy and unpopular last-minute fix. 3. No Brexit A year ago, 48 percent of Britons voted to stay in the EU, including most lawmakers from the main parties, most Scots and most in Northern Ireland. Some still cling to the hope of the Brexit process being reversed. FILE PHOTO: Euro and Pound banknotes are seen in front of BREXIT letters in this picture illustration taken April 28, 2017.Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File PhotoBUT...That hope seems forlorn now that both big British parties now accept Brexit, as does Brussels. First, Britain would need a new government which wants to stop it. Neither a Conservative party coup against May nor a left-wing coalition led by Jeremy Corbyn's Labour, possibly after a new election, seems likely to deliver that. Second, it would have to overturn a British legal opinion that the request to leave under Article 50 cannot be revoked. Third, it would need the EU to agree, most likely by unanimous vote of all 27. And it might mean taking time for another British referendum. Formally, EU leaders insist they would rather Britain not leave. But the prevailing view in private is that the Union is safer without a big member that has always been lukewarm on the project and is now so divided as to be unreliable. 4. Late Brexit Political chaos in Britain has prompted calls for more time to negotiate, possibly on different terms from those May has sought. Article 50 allows for an extension to the two-year deadline if the other states unanimously agree. BUT...EU leaders will hesitate to open a divisive issue among them and want Britain out before European Parliament elections in May 2019. The two-year deadline is designed to weaken the leavers' hand. 5. English Brexit Scotland's government wants a special deal to stay in the single market or, if not, to secede and stay in or rejoin the EU. Ireland's EU commissioner has espoused the idea of keeping Northern Ireland in the EU customs union. May's unionist allies in the province also want to avoid a hard border. BUT...On Scotland, May and the EU doubt a  differentiated deal  on trade and migration can work, while Spain, battling Catalan separatists, may block it. Electoral losses for the Scottish nationalists have also weakened their hand to threaten a new independence vote. On Ireland, such a scenario appears hugely complicated without raising some form of trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. That would be anathema to the hardline Protestant DUP. 6. Soft Brexit This could be the key battleground in the coming months. Many Brexit opponents suggest that, if it goes ahead, Britain should at least stay in the single market for the sake of jobs and trade. BUT...While EU leaders do not rule that out, they have set tough conditions similar to those imposed on Norway, which can access EU markets in return for cash contributions, taking EU migrants as well as refugees and observing rules overseen by EU courts. Such terms are far from what Brexit supporters want and also rob Britain of its big say on EU policy. And Europeans, as well as May, rule out  cherry picking  deals that give Britain access to certain EU markets, like banking. EU leaders say that would risk undermining the whole single market. British proponents of soft Brexit say the EU, especially big exporters to Britain, could be persuaded. But the bloc seems for now committed to not breaking ranks. So talks on  soft Brexit  could be a waste of time. In October, EU summit chair Donald Tusk said:  The only real alternative to a 'hard Brexit' is 'no Brexit'.  Pushing soft Brexit over hard is seen increasing the risk of replacing a smooth Brexit with rough.

LOUIS -- There was a school of thought that St. Louis Cardinals starter Carlos Martinez wasn't capable of crafting a successful outing if he didn't have Yadier Molina to call his pitches. As of Saturday, consider that theory to be a shattered myth. With Eric Fryer catching for the second straight game after Molina had to sit out, Martinez authored the first shutout of his major league career, checking the Philadelphia Phillies on four hits in a 7-0 triumph at Busch Stadium. Martinez (5-5) fanned 11 and walked just one in his 107-pitch gem. His last strikeout was on a 100 mph fastball to Howie Kendrick on his 101st pitch of the game. With the crowd of 43,911 standing and cheering for the 27th out, Martinez induced a game-ending groundout from Maikel Franco. After the out, Martinez walked off the mound, patted his chest three times and hugged Fryer as fireworks went off.  It's been one of my goals,  Martinez said through an interpreter.  I just feel happy. I'm living out my dream. The next goal is a perfect game.  Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at CardinalsPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchWith a triple-digit fastball, two wipeout secondary pitches (slider, changeup) and an improving slow curve, Martinez possesses the arsenal to confound any lineup. He was certainly too much for a Philadelphia nine that has scored just seven runs in its last five games, losing four straight. But doing what he did with Fryer calling pitches displayed the increased maturity in Martinez's approach. It was the first time Fryer had caught Martinez this year, but there were few, if any shake-offs, and definitely a good pace from the outset.  He's always got the stuff,  Fryer said.  It's just a matter of if he can control it the whole game. The focus was there from the outset. You could see guys getting frustrated. They'd get fastball counts and he'd slip a slider in there.  Martinez picked up a strikeout in every inning but the seventh. He whiffed Aaron Altherr three times, all looking. Only twice in 32 hitters did he go to three-ball counts, so precise were his pitches. The closest the Phillies (21-39) got to chasing him was with an inaccurate fastball from reliever Jeanmar Gomez in the bottom of the seventh. Martinez squared around to bunt and then ducked a pitch headed for his noggin. Martinez was awarded first base when plate umpire Chris Conroy said the pitch conked him on the hand, although replays showed the ball appeared to hit nothing but the bat.  I thought he broke his wrist or something and he was fine,  Philadelphia manager Pete Mackanin said.  That surprised me.  Less surprising was that Phillies starter Nick Pivetta (1-3) struggled with command, giving up four walks in his five innings to give him 16 walks in 29 1/3 innings. Saturday's third free pass, a leadoff four-pitch job to Dexter Fowler in the fourth, kick-started the inning which decided the game. Stephen Piscotty doubled Fowler to third. Jedd Gyorko rifled a double off the wall in right-center that plated both runners. Pivetta later balked Gyorko home and Fryer capped the outburst with an RBI single. Pivetta allowed four hits and four runs, picking up a pair of strikeouts. The rookie right-hander has failed to surpass five innings in any of his first six big league starts, although he did pick off runners to end the first two innings. Matt Carpenter added a two-run double in the seventh for St. Louis (28-32). Gyorko finished the scoring with a sacrifice fly to right for his third RBI of the day. Martinez badly wanted to finish what he started. He looked at manager Mike Matheny after the eighth and asked him for the ninth. Mindful of an off-day that will give Martinez five days before his next start, Matheny gave him the chance. Martinez rode it all the way to a personal goal.  It's important for these young guys,  Matheny said of the shutout.  It's a big goal for all of them.  NOTES: St. Louis C Yadier Molina (lower back stiffness) was scratched for a second straight game, with Eric Fryer taking his place. It's just the ninth time in 60 games that Molina hasn't started this year. ... Philadelphia RHP Casey Fien made his first appearance for the team Friday night with two scoreless inning. It also marked a milestone of sorts for Fien, as it was his 300th major league game. ... The Cardinals' 1-2 hitters, 1B Matt Carpenter and CF Dexter Fowler, each had two hits on Friday night.

But with the wind blowing out at Wrigley Field on Saturday afternoon, Reynolds did not mind belting a home run out of the ballpark and on to Waveland Avenue. Teammate Charlie Blackmon also hit a home run that cleared the bleachers as the Rockies cruised to a 9-1 win over the Chicago Cubs.  That's the first time in my life I ever played here with the wind blowing out like it was today,  Reynolds said with a grin.  I keep finding myself in the lineup, so I'm just trying to do my job.  Reynolds' home run traveled an estimated 447 feet, and Blackmon's blast covered an estimated 439 feet. The offensive outburst powered Colorado (41-23) to its seventh consecutive victory, which marks the franchise's longest winning streak since April 9-15, 2011.  The two (home runs) today were really well struck,  Rockies manager Bud Black said.  If the wind was blowing the other way, I think they both would have went out.  Reynolds went 4-for-5 to notch his fourth career four-hit performance. He drove in two runs to give him 53 RBIs on the season, which matches his total from 2016.

As the Rockies enjoyed loud music in the clubhouse after the win, the Cubs quietly searched for answers. Chicago (30-31) did not record an extra-base hit as its losing streak reached four games. Willson Contreras finished 1-for-4 with an RBI to lead the Cubs.  It's a tough moment,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  I get it. But these are young hitters, really young hitters that are going through a tough moment. You've got to stay with them.  Despite a strong wind blowing toward the outfield, Rockies right-hander Jeff Hoffman (4-0) limited the Cubs to one run on four hits in 6 1/3 innings. He walked one and struck out eight, which matched a career high. He went 19 batters without allowing a hit between the first and seventh innings.  I was just trusting my stuff,  Hoffman said.  I felt great. I executed a bunch of pitches, and the defense played great behind me. That's really all I can do is go out there and let them hit it to my Gold Glovers behind me, and let them do the work for me.  Cubs right-hander Eddie Butler (3-2) allowed three runs in five innings to draw the loss. Colorado opened the scoring with two runs in the first inning. DJ LeMahieu slammed a double off the base of the wall in right-center field to drive in Blackmon. Two batters later, Reynolds doubled to the gap in left-center field to score LeMahieu. Reynolds increased the Rockies' lead to 3-0 with a solo shot to lead off the fourth. His blast down the left-field line marked his team-leading 17th home run. Blackmon made it 4-0 in the seventh when he turned on a pitch from Cubs left-hander Brian Duensing for his 15th home run. The ball landed on Sheffield Avenue beyond the right-field bleachers. Chicago cut the deficit to 4-1 on Contreras' run-scoring single in the seventh. Nolan Arenado put the game out of reach with a three-run double in the ninth inning. With two outs and the bases loaded, Arenado hammered a line drive down the left-field line to clear the bases. Arenado scored on a wild pitch later in the ninth to make it 8-1. Ian Desmond added a run-scoring single to complete the rout.  A lot of contributors today -- we had 14 hits,  Black said.  All of the starters had a knock. That's spreading it around. A team win.

Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at MarinersToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch It's not the same when you're on the (Mariners) side,  said Morales, who used to play for Seattle, as did Smoak.  When you play on the other side and for the Blue Jays (the crowd) gives you a lot of energy.  Carrera led off the top of the eighth inning with a home run off Seattle reliever Tony Zych (2-2) to break a 2-2 tie. Smoak led off the ninth with his homer off Steve Cishek to give the Blue Jays an insurance run. Toronto's first hit of the game off Miranda was Morales' two-run shot in the fourth inning that cleared the out-of-town scoreboard in left-center field. All four of the Blue Jays' runs scored via the long ball.  We love home runs. We've scored a lot of runs off of home runs,  Toronto manager John Gibbons said.  I don't know if it will work forever, but right now it's working.  Miranda, who was coming off his first career complete-game victory, allowed only two runs on two hits in 6 1/3 innings. He walked five and struck out two. He retired the first seven Blue Jays in order before running into control problems.  Miranda wasn't as sharp as the last time out,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  He walked a lot.  Trailing 3-2, the Mariners threatened in the bottom off the eighth against reliever Joe Smith. Guillermo Heredia and Robinson Cano led off with singles to put runners at first and second. Nelson Cruz hit a hard one-hopper to the left side of the infield that third baseman Josh Donaldson made a diving stop on and appeared to turn a double play. A video review showed Cruz, who has been nursing a right calf injury, beat the throw to first. But Smith struck out Kyle Seager and got Taylor Motter to ground into a fielder's choice to end the inning. The Mariners tied the score in the bottom of the seventh inning, as Jarrod Dyson scored from first on a stolen base. Dyson led off with a line-drive single to center off Stroman. With Carlos Ruiz at the plate, Dyson took off for second. Catcher Russell Martin's throw was low and skipped into center field, allowing Dyson to take third. When center fielder Kevin Pillar overran the ball, Dyson came home to make it 2-2. Seattle opened the scoring in the second inning. Cruz led off by grounding a single up the middle, moved to second on a wild pitch and scored on Seager's single to right field. NOTES: Blue Jays RF Jose Bautista took two bases on a walk in the eighth inning, as Seattle reliever Tony Zych held the ball behind the mound while glaring at home-plate umpire Jeff Kellogg over his ball-four call. ...

Despite the loss, the Mariners are 40-25 against the Blue Jays at Safeco Field since it opened in 1999, their best home winning percentage against any AL opponent.

Apparently I'm not very good at it. It took me 20 years to get one,  Seager said. Seager's walk-off double with two outs in the ninth inning lifted the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-4 victory over the Cincinnati Reds at Dodger Stadium. Yasiel Puig and pinch hitter Justin Turner singled with one out in the ninth off Reds reliever Drew Storen (1-2). Tony Cingrani replaced Storen and struck out pinch hitter Franklin Gutierrez. Seager, who went 2-for-4 with two RBIs with two doubles, followed with the game-winning hit to left beyond the diving Scooter Gennett.  It's always fun to end with a win, so that was nice,  said Seager, who has reached base in seven of his nine career games against the Reds, batting .400 with a home run, two doubles and seven RBIs. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at DodgersCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchKenley Jansen (4-0) worked a 1-2-3 ninth as the Dodgers (38-25) beat the Reds (29-32) for the eighth straight time at Dodger Stadium. Cody Bellinger homered and Chase Utley went 3-for-4 for Los Angeles. The Dodgers were clinging to a 4-1 lead when manager Dave Roberts lifted starter Alex Wood for reliever Josh Fields with two on and two out in the sixth. Fields promptly served up a three-run homer to Devin Mesoraco, tying the score at 4. For Mesoraco, it was his fourth long ball of the season. Wood was charged with three runs on five hits in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out seven and walked none on 87 pitches (61 strikes). Wood said fatigue set in before working the sixth inning, largely because it was his first start coming off the disabled list due to a shoulder injury.  I felt good and I thought my stuff was good,  said Wood, who was activated off the DL before the game after sustaining inflammation in his SC joint and pitched for the first time since May 26.  But I was pretty gassed there that last inning. But I felt good overall.  Reds starter Asher Wojciechowski allowed a season-high four runs on six hits in five innings. Three of those runs scored in the first.  The first inning, giving up that three-spot really hurt,  Wojciechowski said.  I was able to settle in after that and we were able to battle back like our offense does. For me, it was just that first inning not executing a couple of pitches and them putting up those three runs really hurt.  Seager's RBI double with no outs in the first scored Utley, who led off with a single. Seager came home on Adrian Gonzalez's sacrifice fly with two outs in the inning to make it 2-0. Bellinger followed by cranking a 1-2 Wojciechowski pitch over the wall in right for a 3-0 edge. It was Bellinger's club-high 13th home run this season. It was his third home run off a right-hander. Wood had his scoreless innings streak halted at 28 when Jose Peraza, a former Dodger, drove in Gennett, who reached with an inning-opening double, to cut the Dodgers lead to 3-1 in the third.  Pitched a helluva ball game. Really was great, dominating, tired in the sixth,  Roberts said of Wood.  He got tired and stuff started to fall short.  In the fifth, Puig opened with a double and advanced to third on Wood's sacrifice before scoring on Utley's two-bagger for a 4-1 advantage.  Things that could have happened didn't,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  We took some good at-bats. (But) they played a good game. They scored one off the bullpen in the ninth to beat us but we didn't beat ourselves in that ballgame. I thought we played a pretty good ballgame.

They did it again Saturday night as Brandon Drury hit a two-run homer, allowing the Diamondbacks to eke out a 3-2 win over the Milwaukee Brewers. The D-backs (38-26) have 22 comeback wins, tied with the Los Angeles Angels for most in MLB.  This team can impact the game at any time, any batter, at any moment. And they know it,  manager Torey Lovullo said.  We feel we're never out of any ballgame until the final out.  There's a lot of focus inside of the dugout during the game. They're handing off information. They're looking for that one moment to create a big inning.  We play for big innings. There's no mystery here. We want to score more than one run per inning. It's been translating.  The key moment came with the Brewers leading 2-1 and two out in the sixth. That's when Chris Owings singled and then seemed to distract pitcher Junior Guerra at first base. Guerra got ahead of Drury 0-2 but ended up throwing the ball away on a pickoff attempt, allowing Owings to get to second base. Then Drury worked the count to 3-2 before hitting a two-run homer to left field. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at DiamondbacksMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatch CO obviously creates a little bit of a disturbance on the bases,  Lovullo said.  He (Guerra) lost a little bit of focus. It was the difference in the game.  Drury said,  I know with CO being on the bases, you've got to worry about more things than who's in the box. I definitely think that affected the at bat, for sure.  On the 3-2 pitch,  I kind of thought he was going to come with his split finger. and he did,  Drury said.  I just put a good swing on it.  Zack Godley (2-1) allowed two hits and two runs in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out four and walked one. Though Godley, who has a 2.44 ERA, continues to impress, he doesn't know when he will take the mound again. Godley has already been sent down to the minors once because the D-backs needed arms in the bullpen, and he's one of the few pitchers who have options available. He could be sent down again shortly.  What they decide to do with me has nothing to do with me,  Godley said.  I can't control any of that. All I can do is go out on the mound and pitch and, hopefully, do well enough to stay.  All I can do is control what I can control, and that's to make pitches.  Hernan Perez hit a two-run homer and Guerra (1-1) allowed three runs and five hits in six innings for Milwaukee (33-30).  I thought he pitched well,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said of Guerra.  He battled like he always does. He pitched himself out of jams. A solid outing for sure.  Counsell said he thought Guerra was  cruising  until the sudden turn of events in the sixth.  But give Drury credit.  Andrew Chafin got the last out in the seventh inning and Archie Bradley retired the side in order on seven pitches in the eighth. Closer Fernando Rodney picked up his 16th save. The Brewers opened the scoring in the fourth inning when Godley hit Jesus Aguilar with a pitch and Perez followed with a line-drive homer over the left-field wall. Meanwhile, the D-backs got nothing going early against Guerra. Paul Goldschmidt walked in the first inning, extending a personal best by reaching base for the 37th straight game at Chase Field, a feat that ties Stephen Drew's 2009 club record. Goldschmidt reached second on a wild pitch but was promptly picked off by catcher Manny Pina (with the help of a successful video challenge by the Brewers). In the fifth, Arizona's Rey Fuentes hit a sinking line drive to left that the Brewers' Eric Thames misplayed into a triple. Then Godley hit a roller to shortstop that allowed Fuentes, who got a late start from third base, to barely beat the throw to the plate. Home plate umpire Tripp Gibson called Fuentes out but was overruled after a D-backs' replay challenge, cutting the Brewers' lead to 2-1. NOTES: Brewers 2B Jonathan Villar was placed on the 10-day disabled list Saturday after suffering a lower back strain Friday night while making a spectacular defensive play. Said manager Craig Counsell:  He's young, he's durable. Hopefully, he'll recover quickly.  X-rays were negative. ... To replace Villar, the Brewers called up OF Lewis Brinson, considered the Brewers' top prospect, from Triple-A Colorado Springs.

Mitch Moreland's hit proved to be the timeliest. Moreland smacked a go-ahead two-run double in Boston's three-run seventh and the Red Sox broke the game open with a five-run eighth in an 11-3 rout of Detroit on Saturday night at Fenway Park.  All night long we did a very good job with long at-bats, staying within the strike zone, really being relentless at the plate which is what we try to instill, try to take pride in,  Boston manager John Farrell said. Moreland and Andrew Benintendi each had three RBIs for the Red Sox. Sale (8-2) allowed three runs, nine hits and no walks while striking out seven in seven innings.

Nicholas Castellanos, Miguel Cabrera and Mikie Mahtook each drove in a run for the Tigers, who have dropped three in a row and four of their last five. Verlander, who left Sunday's start against the Chicago White Sox with a groin injury, gave up three runs, five hits and four walks with three strikeouts in a five-inning no-decision.  I was cognizant of (my groin) but (I) made it through about as good as I could have hoped for,  Verlander said.  I was just ... aware of it and not trying to overdo anything.  Warwick Saupold (1-1) took the loss after giving up three runs in an inning of relief. Rutledge made it 6-3 after Moreland's decisive hit in the seventh with an RBI single. Boston put the game out of reach with a five-run eighth. Mahtook's single to shallow center field with one out in the sixth inning tied the score 3-3. Pedroia opened the scoring with a sacrifice fly to right field after Rutledge and Leon singled and Mookie Betts walked to load the bases with nobody out in the Red Sox's third. After Verlander struck out Bogaerts for the second out, Moreland drove an RBI single to right to make it 2-0. Castellanos ripped an RBI double just past the reach of the lunging Rutledge at third base to put the Tigers on the board with one out in the fifth. Cabrera tied it on a soft 4-3 groundout in the next at-bat. Verlander loaded the bases again in the fifth and Benintendi gave Boston a 3-2 lead with a sacrifice fly to center for the inning's second out. The former American League MVP and Cy Young Award winner needed 108 pitches to get through five innings.

Trying not to do too much, he found a flair for the dramatic in the Kansas City Royals' 12-6 win over the San Diego Padres on Saturday afternoon.  I was looking for a pitch to drive and get into the outfield, that was the main goal,  Cain said.  It was a two-seamer inside. I pulled my hands inside and it got out for me. It was huge.  Cain's grand slam was among his two home runs and led to five RBIs as Kansas City evened the series. The Royals had five home runs, their most since July 23, 2003, at the Minnesota Twins. Salvador Perez hit the go-ahead homer in the eighth inning, right after Eric Hosmer's two-run tying blast, as Kansas City scored nine runs in the inning. Cain's second career grand slam, off reliever Jose Valdez, was the first of the year for the Royals and his third hit of the game. Perez's 100th career homer was his third in three straight games in San Diego, including last summer's All-Star Game. Hosmer, who was the All-Star Game MVP and had a big homer here in March during the World Baseball Classic for the USA, added his sixth homer of the season.  It's a fun place to play,  said Hosmer, who homered in the same inning as Perez, just like they did in the All-Star Game.  The weather here doesn't get any better, it's a beautiful field and a great atmosphere. I've had some great moments and I don't really know what the cause of it is.

Travis Wood (1-2) got the win. Jose Pirela had a homer and three RBIs for San Diego, finishing a triple shy of the cycle. Pirela and Cory Spangenberg had three hits. The Padres used six relievers after Miguel Diaz's starting debut fizzled. Diaz lasted two-plus innings, allowing a hit and three walks with a strikeout.  Probably a little bit over-amped starting for the first time,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  The way he was coming out with guns blazing it was going to be hard to get into the fourth inning with him today.  Diaz said,  It was definitely a case of me being a little too quick with my delivery.  Kansas City right-hander Ian Kennedy ran his winless streak to 15 starts. He worked six innings and was charged with four runs and six hits. He walked two and struck out five.  All in all, his command was much better than it has been,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  He got us through six innings and we needed it. Our bullpen is on fumes right now.  The Royals scored single runs in the sixth and seventh to pull within 4-3. Cain homered and Whit Merrifield had a run-scoring single. San Diego forged ahead 4-1 with a three-run fifth inning. Pirela had a two-run double and Yangervis Solarte knocked him in with a sharp single. The Royals tied the score at 1 in the fifth on Alcides Escobar's first homer. Diaz struggled with his control and wasn't around long enough to fix it. He walked a runner in the second, then was bailed out by a double play. But in the third, Alex Gordon opened with a single and consecutive walks to Kennedy and Whit Merrifield ended Diaz's day. The Royals were poised for a big inning but fell short. Craig Stammen entered and was asked to maneuver around the heart of the Royals' lineup. He struck out Jorge Bonifacio and got Cain to hit into a double play, which was started by a nifty play by shortstop Erick Aybar. The Padres struck quickly when Pirela scorched his second homer in the majors and his first since playing with the New York Yankees in 2015. The leadoff batter smacked Kennedy's 93 mph fastball 409 feet for a 1-0 lead. NOTES: Royals LHP Danny Duffy (oblique) isn't with the club as he stayed in Kansas City to continue his rehabilitation.

Both bills were drawn up before the dispute between Qatar and others erupted. Turkey has also pledged to provide food and water supplies to Qatar.  Turkey has maintained good relations with Qatar as well as several of its Gulf Arab neighbors. Turkey and Qatar have both provided support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and backed rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Turkey and fellow NATO member the United States have also been at loggerheads regarding U.S. support the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade-long insurgency on its soil. The United States said last week it had started supplying arms to the YPG for an assault on the Syrian town of Raqqa, deepening Turkey's anger. The YPG's role in the Raqqa campaign has strained ties between the United States and Turkey, which fears growing Kurdish ascendancy along its border.

The conviction of Taimoor Raza, 30, follows a high-profile crackdown against blasphemy on social media by the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Blasphemy is a highly sensitive topic in Muslim-majority Pakistan, where insulting the Prophet Mohammad is a capital crime for which dozens are sitting on death row. Even mere accusations are enough to spark mass uproar and mob justice. Shafiq Qureshi, public prosecutor in Bahawalpur, about 500km (300 miles) south of provincial capital Lahore, said Raza was convicted for allegedly making derogatory remarks against Prophet Mohammad, his wives and companions.  An anti terrorism court of Bahawalpur has awarded him the death sentence,  Qureshi told Reuters.  It is the first ever death sentence in a case that involves social media.  It is rare for a counter-terrorism court to hear blasphemy cases but Raza's trial fell under this category because his charge sheet included counter-terrorism offences linked to hate speech. Qureshi said Raza was arrested after playing blasphemous and hate speech material on his phone on a bus stop in Bahawalpur, where a counter-terrorism officer arrested him and confiscated his phone. The material obtained from the phone led to Raza's conviction, he added.  The trial was conducted in Bahawapur jail in tight security,  Qureshi said Qureshi added that Raza belongs to the minority Shia community and in court he accused of spreading  hate speech  against the Deobani sect, which adheres to a strict school of Sunni Islam. Relations between Shia and majority Sunni communities have flared up at times in Pakistan, with some extremist Sunni groups such as Lashkhar-e-Janghvi trying to exploit sectarian tensions. Several other violent incidents linked to blasphemy accusations have alarmed human rights groups and activists in recent months. Police are currently investigating over 20 students and some faculty members in connection with the killing of Mashal Khan, a student who was beaten to death on April following a dorm debate about religion -- an attack that shocked the country. Since then, parliament has discussed adding safeguards to the blasphemy laws, a move seen as groundbreaking in Pakistan where political leaders have been assassinated for even discussing changes. As Raza's blasphemy conviction was under the counter-terrorism court, he will be able to appeal his sentence in the High Court and later in the Supreme Court. There have been at least 67 murders over unproven allegations since 1990, according to figures from a research center and independent records kept by Reuters.

Qatar has been in talks with Iran and Turkey to secure food and water supplies after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut links, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism. Qatar says the allegations are based on lies.  Following the sanctions ... on Qatar, IranAir has so far transported food and vegetables to this country by four flights,  Shahrokh Noushabadi, head of public relations at Iran's national airline, was quoted as saying by Fars news agency.

In a letter seen by Reuters, Sessions told Senator Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, that the intelligence committee is the  most appropriate  place to address matters that came up during Comey's hearing on Thursday. The letter did not say whether Sessions planned to give public testimony or to appear before the panel behind closed doors.  In light of reports regarding Mr. Comey's recent testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it is important that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum,  Sessions said in the letter. The committee  is the most appropriate forum for such matters, as it has been conducting an investigation and has access to relevant, classified information,  he added. The Senate panel is investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In March, Sessions removed himself from any probe into alleged Russian meddling in the elections, but maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose that he met last year with Russia's ambassador. In testimony to the Senate panel on Thursday, Comey accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine the FBI's investigation of possible collusion by people in Trump's campaign with Russia's alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Comey's appearance raised new questions about the attorney general's relationship with Russian officials and others with ties to President Vladimir Putin. One question is whether Sessions had any undisclosed meetings with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak or other Russians during the campaign or after Trump's inauguration. In the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years, Comey told lawmakers the Trump administration had lied and defamed him and the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the president dismissed him on May 9.

We have no dollars because there is no shipment or transportation from the United Arab Emirates. There is no stock,  said a dealer at the Qatar-UAE Exchange House in Doha's City Center mall.  The shipment is blocked from the UAE.  Several other exchange houses in Doha also told Reuters they had no supplies of dollars. At Qatar-UAE Exchange, dozens of people - some of the foreigners who comprise nearly 90 percent of the population of 2.6 million - waited quietly in line to change money or make remittances to their home countries.  I spoke with my wife this morning. She said, 'Send your savings to me now.' I am not panicked but my family are scared,  said John Vincent, an air-conditioning repairman from the Philippines.   I sent 2,000 riyals ($550) home but I have some more savings left here in Qatar. I will see what the situation is in coming days before I decide what to do.  The dollar shortages do not mean Qatar, which is one of the richest states in the world per capita and has huge foreign reserves, is running out of money. But they show how the diplomatic crisis is disrupting parts of the financial system. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahraini and Egyptian banks began scaling back business with Qatar last week after their governments cut diplomatic and transport ties, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism.  Then at the weekend, the UAE told its banks to exercise  enhanced due diligence  towards six Qatari banks which, it alleged, might have done business with people or entities on a terrorism blacklist. That stopped short of a complete ban on business with Qatar but the effect may turn out to be much the same. UAE banks were absent from Qatar's foreign exchange and money markets on Sunday, causing both those markets to slow down, because they feared any deals could expose them to legal risk, bankers said. Some Western banks with a presence in Qatar continued business as normal, partly because they did not want to lose out on billions of dollars of building projects which Qatar plans before it hosts the soccer World Cup in 2022. But other Western banks have halted new Qatar business including interbank and syndicated lending, while continuing to service existing business, banking sources said, declining to be named because of political sensitivities. People stand outside Qatar-UAE Exchange House money exchange office in Doha, Qatar, June 11, 2017.Tom Finn Everybody is shocked - they're not worried about Qatar's credit, they're worried about compliance and the risk that the local sanctions could be escalated to an international level,  said one foreign banker in the region. Dollars Exchange house dealers in Qatar said the dollar shortage was partly a seasonal phenomenon, because the Gulf's hot summer and the holy month of Ramadan had begun, periods when there was traditionally high demand for travel abroad. Sudhir Kumar Shetty, president of UAE Exchange, which has eight branches in Qatar, said his firm was continuing to handle remittances and currency buying as usual in that country. He said the firm hadn't seen any major change in remittance volumes due to the diplomatic tension. But he added that dollar supply was not meeting demand in Qatar and attributed this partly to flows of the U.S. currency from other Gulf countries being disrupted.  Everywhere, all the banks and exchange houses, there are no dollars. All the exchange houses are trying to get currencies from other countries,  the dealer at Qatar-UAE Exchange said, adding that his firm was hoping for a shipment from Hong Kong. The six Qatari banks named by the UAE - Qatar National Bank QNBK.QA (QNB), Qatar Islamic Bank QISB.QA, Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB.QA), Masraf Al Rayan MARK.QA, Doha Bank (DOBK.QA) and unlisted Barwa Bank IPO-BABK.QA - did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. The share prices of all five of the listed banks fell on Sunday, with QNB losing 0.5 percent, as investors reacted to the prospect of the banks facing funding difficulties because of reduced ability to borrow from foreign institutions. Qatari banks have around 60 billion riyals ($16.5 billion) in funding in the form of customer and interbank deposits from other Gulf states, SICO Bahrain estimated. Most of this could eventually be withdrawn if the crisis continues. Bankers expect Qatari banks to borrow from the central bank's repo facility if they become short of funds. The repo rate is currently at 2.25 percent and the cost of borrowing three-month money among Qatari banks QAQAR3MD= rose near that level on Sunday, to 2.20 percent, the highest in many years. Central bank rules limit the size of the repos to 2 percent of each bank's private sector deposits. Bankers speculate the central bank may lift this cap; the central bank did not respond to requests for comment.

As the diplomatic crisis in the region continued, the UAE told its banks to stop dealing with 59 individuals and 12 entities with alleged links to Qatar, and advised its banks to conduct  enhanced due diligence  towards the six Qatari lenders. Five of the six are listed on the market: Qatar National Bank, Qatar Islamic Bank, Qatar International Islamic Bank, Masraf Al Rayan and Doha Bank. All of them fell on Sunday with Islamic lender Masraf Al Rayan, the biggest loser, down 4.0 percent.

Last week, it shed 7.1 percent because of the crisis.

Ethylene maker National Petrochemical lost 3.5 percent to close at its lowest price since November. Shares of companies that might benefit from index compiler MSCI upgrading Riyadh to emerging market status were relatively resilient; dairy producer Almarai rose 0.9 percent to 82.90 riyals, a fresh all-time high.

It has rocketed 46 percent this month on news that it has received a portion of its overdue payments from Egypt and on hopes for its legal efforts to recover money from Iraqi Kurdistan. A 0.9 percent rise by shares in the second largest bank in the region by assets after QNB, First Abu Dhabi Bank, also carried the Abu Dhabi index 0.5 percent higher. In Dubai, builder Drake & Scull rose 1.2 percent to 0.422 dirham; it has risen 5.5 percent since Thursday in unusually large volumes. Former chief executive Khaldoun Tabari has sold his stake in the company to Tabarak Investment, a source told Zawya, a Thomson Reuters publication. Tabarak Investment's stake stands at around 18 to 20 percent after the sale, making it the largest shareholder, Zawya said. In April, DSI said it would sell 500 million dirhams ($136 million) of shares to Tabarak as part of its capital restructuring programme, subject to regulatory approval. The company's business environment still looks tough, according to analysts.  Project tendering seems to be muted in 2017, we do not expect any foreseeable significant operational improvements.

We have no dollars because there is no shipment or transportation from the United Arab Emirates. There is no stock,  said a dealer at the Qatar-UAE Exchange House in Doha's City Center mall.  The shipment is blocked from the UAE.  Several other exchange houses in Doha also told Reuters they had no supplies of dollars. At Qatar-UAE Exchange, dozens of people - some of the foreigners who comprise nearly 90 percent of the population of 2.6 million - waited quietly in line to change money or make remittances to their home countries.  I spoke with my wife this morning. She said, 'Send your savings to me now.' I am not panicked but my family are scared,  said John Vincent, an air-conditioning repairman from the Philippines.  I sent 2,000 riyals ($550) home but I have some more savings left here in Qatar. I will see what the situation is in coming days before I decide what to do.  The dollar shortages do not mean Qatar, which is one of the richest states in the world per capita and has huge foreign reserves, is running out of money. But they show how the diplomatic crisis is disrupting parts of the financial system. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahraini and Egyptian banks began scaling back business with Qatar last week after their governments cut diplomatic and transport ties, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism. Then at the weekend, the UAE told its banks to exercise  enhanced due diligence  towards six Qatari banks which, it alleged, might have done business with people or entities on a terrorism blacklist. That stopped short of a complete ban on business with Qatar but the effect may turn out to be much the same. UAE banks were absent from Qatar's foreign exchange and money markets on Sunday, causing both those markets to slow down, because they feared any deals could expose them to legal risk, bankers said. Some Western banks with a presence in Qatar continued business as normal, partly because they did not want to lose out on billions of dollars of building projects which Qatar plans before it hosts the soccer World Cup in 2022. But other Western banks have halted new Qatar business including interbank and syndicated lending, while continuing to service existing business, banking sources said, declining to be named because of political sensitivities.  Everybody is shocked - they're not worried about Qatar's credit, they're worried about compliance and the risk that the local sanctions could be escalated to an international level,  said one foreign banker in the region. Dollars Exchange house dealers in Qatar said the dollar shortage was partly a seasonal phenomenon, because the Gulf's hot summer and the holy month of Ramadan had begun, periods when there was traditionally high demand for travel abroad. Sudhir Kumar Shetty, president of UAE Exchange, which has eight branches in Qatar, said his firm was continuing to handle remittances and currency buying as usual in that country. He said the firm hadn't seen any major change in remittance volumes due to the diplomatic tension. But he added that dollar supply was not meeting demand in Qatar and attributed this partly to flows of the U.S. currency from other Gulf countries being disrupted.  Everywhere, all the banks and exchange houses, there are no dollars. All the exchange houses are trying to get currencies from other countries,  the dealer at Qatar-UAE Exchange said, adding that his firm was hoping for a shipment from Hong Kong. The six Qatari banks named by the UAE - Qatar National Bank (QNB), Qatar Islamic Bank, Qatar International Islamic Bank, Masraf Al Rayan, Doha Bank and unlisted Barwa Bank IPO-BABK.QA - did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. The share prices of all five of the listed banks fell on Sunday, with QNB losing 0.5 percent, as investors reacted to the prospect of the banks facing funding difficulties because of reduced ability to borrow from foreign institutions. Qatari banks have around 60 billion riyals ($16.5 billion) in funding in the form of customer and interbank deposits from other Gulf states, SICO Bahrain estimated. Most of this could eventually be withdrawn if the crisis continues. Bankers expect Qatari banks to borrow from the central bank's repo facility if they become short of funds. The repo rate is currently at 2.25 percent and the cost of borrowing three-month money among Qatari banks rose near that level on Sunday, to 2.20 percent, the highest in many years. Central bank rules limit the size of the repos to 2 percent of each bank's private sector deposits. Bankers speculate the central bank may lift this cap; the central bank did not respond to requests for comment.

They have been working extra shifts since Monday when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and other nations cut ties and severed all transport links with Qatar, prompting fears of food shortages in the import-dependent country. The Saudi-led push to isolate Qatar by cutting diplomatic and trade ties over its alleged support for terrorism has choked food imports from key transit points in Saudi and the UAE and caused panic buying at shops early in the week. The spat has forced the tiny, gas-rich state to turn to other foreign exporters including Turkey and Iran but also to its own local food companies to keep supermarket shelves stacked. In the meat plant on Saturday, workers hurried about feeding frozen chicken breasts imported from Brazil through shiny metal grinders and pushing them in trolleys into an adjacent room to be packaged.  We've put two shifts instead of one and stopped exporting to concentrate production for the local market ... There are plans to treble production,  said Ahmed al-Khalaf, chairman of International Projects Development Co., the parent company of Qatar Meat, in his office adjoining the plant. Qatar Meat has been working to double its output of chicken, beef and lamb to 40 tonnes per day. Khalaf says this is proof Qatar can survive without having to rely on neighbors who have shunned it. Still Dependent? Khalaf's food businesses, which include the meat plant run by one of his sons and a farm that grows root vegetables, both felt the pinch when the UAE and Saudi shut their borders. Up to 30 shipping containers of Khalaf's remain stranded at the Jebel Ali port in Dubai, a major business and transit hub for the region. But by flying in goods directly from countries such as Turkey and using other ports in the Gulf including Salalah in Oman, the factory can cover its demand for raw material. Workers work in a meat processing plant in Doha, Qatar, June 10, 2017.Naseem Zeitoon Some equipment is coming by aeroplane from abroad to double the capacity of the production line,  Khalaf said. Qatar, a small desert country, relies heavily on imports to feed its 2.7 million mostly foreign population and nearly half of Qatar's food comes across the border from Saudi Arabia. Like many local businesses, Qatar Meat imports all the meat that it processes and packages.  The raw material - we bring it from outside,  Khalaf said. Slideshow (8 Images)'We Can Supply Qatar' Other Qatari companies are also sensing opportunity. In his dairy factory, Mohammed al-Kuwari, 30, is working weekends during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan to oversee production.      The situation is great! As you can see, there's lots of production and we have a big share in the market,  he said as employees packaged yoghurts with the Rawa brand of his Gulf Food Production company. The factory is producing 20,000 liters of dairy products per day, up from 15,000 liters, he said. Gulf Food Production also relies heavily on import, including milk from France.  It normally comes in by ship but soon maybe it will all come in by air for the same price,  thanks to government support, he said. As for relations with Gulf neighbors, Khalaf says he is already looking elsewhere.  I'm leaving next week to make some other arrangements to bring from other countries  including Turkey, Azerbaijan and Ukraine, he said.

Saudi Arabia and allies Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) severed ties with Qatar last week, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and arch-foe Iran - charges Doha denies. The rift has disrupted travel, separated families, severed commercial links and sown confusion among banks and businesses while deepening divisions between their respective allies fighting in wars and political struggles from Libya to Yemen.  (Kuwait) affirms the readiness of the brothers in Qatar to understand the reality of the qualms and concerns of their brothers and to heed the noble endeavours to enhance security and stability,  Kuwait's state news agency KUNA quoted Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid al-Sabah as saying. Kuwait, which has retained ties with Qatar and has often acted as a mediator in regional disputes, said it wanted to resolve the dispute  within the unified Gulf house . A previous mediation effort by Kuwait in which the Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah shuttled between Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha, failed to achieve an immediate breakthrough.  Is this the beginning of wisdom and reasonable thinking? I hope so,  UAE minister of state for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on Twitter in reaction to Kuwait saying Qatar was ready to listen to the grievances. U.S. President Donald Trump at first offered to host Qatar and its adversaries - all U.S. allies - at the White House, but on Friday said Qatar has been a high-level sponsor of terrorism and backed the Gulf pressure. Saudi Arabia's powerful Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed efforts to  counter terrorism and extremism  in a telephone call with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Sunday, state news agency SPA said. But a Qatari diplomat said the crisis reflected a lack of U.S. leadership.  This is the biggest testimony to U.S. failure in the Gulf,  the diplomat told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.  (It) gives others the impression the U.S. does not know how to manage the relationship with its allies or is incapable.  On Friday Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt tightened their squeeze on Qatar by putting dozens of figures and charities they link to the country on terrorism blacklists. Qatar's official overseer of charities denied on Sunday that philanthropic groups in the country backed terrorism, saying it deplored the accusation. Iran Flights A peninsular nation of 2.5 million people, Qatar has for years punched well above its weight in world affairs by parleying its vast gas wealth into influence across the region, irking many with its maverick stances and support for Islamists. But it was importing 80 percent of its food from bigger Gulf Arab neighbours before they cut ties and is now in talks with Iran and Turkey to secure food and water supplies. Iran - the main regional rival of Saudi Arabia - sent four cargo planes of food to Qatar and plans to provide 100 tonnes of fruit and vegetables every day, Iranian officials said on Sunday, amid concerns of shortages. Senior officials from the countries opposed to Qatar have warned it that appealing for foreign assistance will not advance a reconciliation. Qatar's energy minister said on Sunday Doha remained committed to an oil output cut deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC producers last month. Mohammed al-Sada said in a statement:  circumstances in the region shall not prevent the state of Qatar from honouring its international commitment of cutting its oil production . In a sign Gulf states were seeking to lessen the human impact of their June 5 severing of ties, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE said on Sunday they had set up hotlines to help families with Qatari members, without elaborating.

But with no pop cultural juggernauts like rap history musical  Hamilton  this year, the awards show, which caps a record-breaking season, is also looking to a musicals and top celebrities to stoke interest.  There's never been so much diversity of product on Broadway in subject matter, in (production) size, in casting,  said Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League, which organizes the Tonys along with the American Theatre Wing.  The stories of our lives, of what's going on in the streets of our country are coming to our stages, and people are flocking to see them,  she said, noting Broadway's record year with $1.45 billion in box office receipts. While a hit revival of  Hello, Dolly!  starring Bette Midler, and shows boasting Kevin Kline and Glenn Close have helped drive business, teen-angst driven  Dear Evan Hansen,  a musical with no stars which is set in motion by a suicide, is the favorite for the top prize at Sunday's awards show. Dark horse musical  Come from Away,  set in tiny Gander, Newfoundland where dozens of jets were forced to land after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington D.C., stranding thousands who were taken in by the locals, has been packing houses and gaining momentum in the Tonys race. Among plays, four American playwrights making their Broadway debuts are vying for best play.  Oslo,  J.T. Rogers' behind-the-scenes look at the 1993 Middle East peace accords, and Lynn Nottage's Pulitzer Prize-winner  Sweat,  about factory life, racial tension and down-sizing, are seen as the top contenders. Citing  the times we're living in,  American Theatre Wing president Heather Hitchens reflected that  people are finding ways to respond to that and grapple with that. It's a rich time for people to be creating.  But traditional shows with spectacular sets and costumes and big stars will also be front and center on Sunday. Midler, 71, is all-but-assured of winning her first competitive Tony for her star turn in  Hello Dolly,  which scored 10 nominations. Musical  Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812  leads the Tonys contenders with 12 nods. But the lavish, unconventional spectacle based on a snippet of  War and Peace  which stars Josh Groban may see its best shot at a major prize for directing, awards watchers say. Kevin Kline is considered a shoo-in for his turn as the egocentric actor in Noel Cowards'  Present Laughter,  while Laurie Metcalf is heavily favored as best actress for  A Doll's Life, Part 2,  a sequel to the Ibsen classic. The Tonys, hosted for the first time by Kevin Spacey, will be televised live by CBS on Sunday from New York's Radio City Music Hall.

UNRWA was established by the U.N. General Assembly in 1949 after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war that followed Israel's creation.

Chris Gunness, UNRWA's chief spokesman, said in an email to Reuters that only the General Assembly, by a majority vote, could change the agency's mandate. Slideshow (3 Images) In December 2016, UNRWA's mandate was extended for three years by the General Assembly by a large majority,  he added. Netanyahu made his comments two days after UNRWA said it had discovered part of a tunnel running under two of its schools in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. UNRWA said it had protested to Hamas, the Islamist group that rules the enclave and which had used a network of cross-border tunnels to launch attacks inside Israel in a 2014 war. UNRWA condemned the tunnel as a violation of neutrality. Hamas denied it was responsible for building it. Abu Hasna, speaking in Hebrew on Israel Radio, cautioned that if  UNRWA is gone  in the Gaza Strip, where its food, educational and health services are crucial,  two million people will turn into IS (Islamic State) supporters.

This is despite previous delays in payments from the Saudi government, which could have pushed the company to default on a syndicated loan, he said. Aster, which operates hospitals, clinics and pharmacies in the Gulf and India, is attracted to Saudi Arabia because of the size of the market compared with other Gulf states, and also because of ownership rules, which would let Aster own up to 100 percent of a business, said Azad Moopen.  We consider Saudi a good market despite payment difficulties which we had there,  he said. Aster obtained a $295 million loan from India's Axis Bank in April. The loan replaced and repaid $155 million of a $295 million facility which the firm raised in 2015. Aster replaced the facility to obtain better terms, such as a longer maturity and looser financial requirements for its debt-to-equity ratio. The decision to look for better terms was triggered by delays in payments of about $150 million from Saudi Arabia's ministry of health. Many companies in the Saudi market, especially construction firms, have suffered such delays as government finances are squeezed by low oil prices.  Payments were overdue for nearly 1-1/2 to two years,  said Moopen, and were not made for the whole of 2016.  By early 2017, with $150 million pending,  we were not sure when we were going to get this money, and we didn't want to default, that's why we wanted better terms from the banks.  Aster's new loan facility is being syndicated by Axis, though no bank has joined the loan yet. It has a 10-year tenor, while the previous facility was for five years.  Almost half of the amount due from Saudi Arabia has been repaid in 2017. The ministry of health asked for a discount on the total debt and the company agreed, Moopen said without elaborating. The payment delays were related to Aster's 250-bed Sanad Hospital in Riyadh, Aster's only facility in the kingdom. The ministry of health did not respond to a request for comment. Aster also has a hospital in Qatar.  The Aster Qatar Hospital has been approved by authorities and has started functioning, even though the official inauguration has not been done,  Moopen said.   We shall be waiting for the prevailing situation to crystallize for the official launch,  he said when asked about the diplomatic crisis that erupted this week between Qatar and neighboring states. The company filed a prospectus for an initial public offer (IPO) of shares in India in June last year. The IPO is now expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2017, with Axis Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Kotak Mahindra Bank as lead banks, said Moopen.

Footage of the late Saturday protests shared on social media showed hundreds of demonstrators holding placards and shouting slogans while marching along Nanjing Road, a glitzy shopping strip in the city center. One video seen by Reuters showed police setting up blockades and dragging a demonstrator away. Media carried no reports of the demonstrations, while mentions of the protests on social media were scrubbed by internet censors. Shanghai police did not respond to requests for comment. Two witnesses told Reuters that about 10 of the protesters who were hoisting banners and appeared to be leading the demonstrations were taken away by police.  One whole side of the street in front of the Apple store was filled with people,  said one nearby stall owner who declined to be identified, adding that the crowd gathered around 8 p.m. and dispersed by 10 p.m.  The police came and took the leaders away.  Protesters were angry about measures announced on May 17 by Shanghai's housing bureau to  clean-up and rectify  commercial office projects that had been converted into apartments to cater for residential needs, in a gray area property developers previously exploited by acquiring land at cheaper prices than residential-zoned land.  The government measures, part of a bid to keep property speculation and soaring real estate prices in check, required developers and buyers to rectify violations such as separately installed toilets and kitchens before they are able to be sold on, effectively rendering them uninhabitable and worth a fraction of the purchase price. Some homeowners felt aggrieved because they bought the apartments from developers off the plan, secured finance and locked themselves into a contract before being left stranded when the changes were announced. Amid soaring prices, real estate purchases across Chinese cities often follow years of penny-pinching and the contribution of life savings from parents and grandparents. New property prices on average rose 26.5 per cent in Shanghai last year.  They are shouting for their only home in Shanghai, bought by their whole family's savings through legal means,  one person said of the protests in a Weibo post, which was later deleted. A total of 17 million square meters of projects are targeted by the campaign, the Shanghai government said on its social media account, of which 5 million square meters have been delivered to buyers. A list of developments affected by the campaign published by the Shanghai government on May 18 included property giant Greenland's Fengshanghui development among four  typical  projects that needed rectification. Protests, while still relatively rare in China, increasingly break out over contentious issues including the construction of garbage incinerators or pollution from factories near homes.

Footage of the late Saturday protests shared on social media showed hundreds of demonstrators holding placards and shouting slogans while marching along Nanjing Road, a glitzy shopping strip in the city center. One video seen by Reuters showed police setting up blockades and dragging a demonstrator away. Media carried no reports of the demonstrations, while mentions of the protests on social media were scrubbed by internet censors. Shanghai police did not respond to requests for comment. Two witnesses told Reuters that about 10 of the protesters who were hoisting banners and appeared to be leading the demonstrations were taken away by police.  One whole side of the street in front of the Apple store was filled with people,  said one nearby stall owner who declined to be identified, adding that the crowd gathered around 8 p.m. and dispersed by 10 p.m.  The police came and took the leaders away.  Protesters were angry about measures announced on May 17 by Shanghai's housing bureau to  clean-up and rectify  commercial office projects that had been converted into apartments to cater for residential needs, in a gray area property developers previously exploited by acquiring land at cheaper prices than residential-zoned land.  The government measures, part of a bid to keep property speculation and soaring real estate prices in check, required developers and buyers to rectify violations such as separately installed toilets and kitchens before they are able to be sold on, effectively rendering them uninhabitable and worth a fraction of the purchase price. Some homeowners felt aggrieved because they bought the apartments from developers off the plan, secured finance and locked themselves into a contract before being left stranded when the changes were announced. Amid soaring prices, real estate purchases across Chinese cities often follow years of penny-pinching and the contribution of life savings from parents and grandparents. New property prices on average rose 26.5 per cent in Shanghai last year.  They are shouting for their only home in Shanghai, bought by their whole family's savings through legal means,  one person said of the protests in a Weibo post, which was later deleted. A total of 17 million square meters of projects are targeted by the campaign, the Shanghai government said on its social media account, of which 5 million square meters have been delivered to buyers. A list of developments affected by the campaign published by the Shanghai government on May 18 included property giant Greenland's Fengshanghui development among four  typical  projects that needed rectification. Protests, while still relatively rare in China, increasingly break out over contentious issues including the construction of garbage incinerators or pollution from factories near homes.

The 60-year-old leader said she had tapped experience across the  whole of the Conservative Party  when she appointed Michael Gove, a long-serving cabinet minister who had clashed with May when she was home secretary, as agriculture minister. It was a surprise move - Gove was sacked as justice minister by May last year after his bid to become party leader forced now-foreign minister Boris Johnson from the race, amid accusations of treachery and political backstabbing. But after gambling away a majority in parliament in an election she did not need to call, May needs to unite a disillusioned party around her to not only support her in the Brexit talks but also to strike a deal with a small Northern Irish party that will enable her to stay in power.  What I'm doing now is actually getting on with the immediate job. And I think that's what's important, I think that's what the public would expect. They want to see government providing that certainty and stability,  she said.  What I've done today is see people from across the party accepting the invitation to be in my cabinet, and crucially I've brought in talent from across the whole of the Conservative Party. I believe that's important.  Weakened Stature May formed her cabinet despite failing to win a majority in Thursday's parliamentary election, when her Conservatives won 318 House of Commons seats. Labour, the main opposition party, won 262. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he could still be prime minister, although his party has no obvious way to build a majority coalition. He said a new election might be necessary later this year or early in 2018. Apart from Gove and her close ally Damian Green, promoted to Cabinet Office minister to oversee the day-to-day running of the government, May confirmed most of the ministers from her previous cabinet. Related CoverageFACTBOX: Key dates for UK PM May as she seeks deal to stay in powerUK Conservatives must rally behind PM May, says trade minister FoxBrexit campaigner Gove says surprised PM May asked him to join cabinetThis marked an apparent reversal of plans to turf out those considered less than loyal - a sign of her weakened stature in a party that traditionally craves strong leaders. In return, she won effusive pledges of loyalty, but she will have to sell her premiership to Conservative lawmakers at a meeting on Monday.  I am going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her too,  said Johnson, who had been touted as a possible successor to May. Liam Fox, trade minister, also said that May was the only person to take Britain out of the European Union. Keeping Enemies Close The political turmoil comes a week before Britain is due to start negotiating the terms of its exit from the European Union in talks of unprecedented complexity that are supposed to wrap up by the end of March 2019, when Britain actually leaves. That timeline now looks even more ambitious than before, not least because May's electoral debacle has emboldened those within her own party who object to her  hard Brexit  approach of leaving the European single market and customs union. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves after a church service in Sonning, Britain June 11, 2017.Stefan WermuthA Conservative source said the move to include Gove in her cabinet may suggest she has learnt a lesson after firing George Osborne, the former finance minister who as editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper, has become a vocal critic.  Theresa May is a dead woman walking. It's just how long she's going to remain on death row,  Osborne told the BBC. The move might offer hope to Conservative lawmakers who have criticized her style of government. Several have said that she seeks to concentrate too much power in her immediate circle, leaving her cabinet and parliament powerless. Two of her closest aides, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, who had been the focus of some criticism, resigned on Saturday.  We are going to see, I hope, more collective decision-making in the cabinet. I and other senior colleagues have made that clear to her,  said defense minister Michael Fallon. Slideshow (18 Images)Dup Deal May's only hope of forming a government now is to win support from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which won 10 seats. She is seeking a so-called confidence and supply deal, which would involve the DUP supporting the Conservatives on key votes but not joining a formal coalition. The DUP does not work or negotiate on Sundays for religious reasons, but officials from both sides are due to meet on Monday, and DUP leader Arlene Foster told Sky News she would meet May on Tuesday. Senior Conservative lawmaker Graham Brady said the prospect of being propped up by the socially conservative DUP, which is strongly focused on Northern Ireland's specific political complexities, was causing concern in his party.  I think there is concern about the policies of the DUP, the domestic policies in Northern Ireland, but I think it's pretty clear that any arrangement that is reached is not going to be a full coalition,  he told BBC Radio. The DUP is strongly opposed to single-sex marriage and abortion, at odds with Conservative policies. There are also concerns about the potential impact of the proposed arrangement on Northern Ireland's peace agreement, which relies in part on London being an impartial arbiter between those, such as the DUP, who want the province to remain in the United Kingdom and those who want it to be part of Ireland. Even if a deal is struck, May could struggle to get backing from parliament for her Brexit stance. Fallon told the BBC the government would be able to muster parliamentary support for its Brexit plans, adding:  Our view of Brexit I don't think has changed.  But Anna Soubry, a Conservative member of parliament who campaigned ahead of last year's referendum for Britain to stay in the EU, disagreed.  I don't think she does have a majority in the House of Commons for leaving the single market,  she told Sky News.

The comments followed a report in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper which said the German government was examining a possible reduction in the tax, a step recommended by several economists. A ministry spokeswoman did not deny the report but cautioned that such a move would  have only very limited effect on the current account balance,  and it would be more important and sensible to increase investment in Germany. The government continually reviewed economists' recommendations and examined ways to reduce the surpluses, she added. Germany faces a national election in September, making immediate changes to taxation policy unlikely.  German officials say the country's current account surplus stems from a variety of factors, including some beyond the government's control, such as the price of oil or the euro exchange rate, as well as high demand for German products. Chancellor Angela Merkel last month pushed back against renewed U.S. criticism of German surpluses by Trump, who told EU officials that Germany was  very bad  on trade. [nL8N1IS2SF] She said she and Trump agreed to set up a working group to exchange information on bilateral economic ties. Peter Navarro, a Trump trade adviser, has repeatedly criticised Germany and suggested it is deliberately pushing down the value of the euro, an argument the Germans reject, noting that the currency's strength is largely determined by policies of the independent European Central Bank.

China has often urged Pakistan to improve security after pledging around $57 billion to build power plants, railways, and roads that will cross the Himalayas to connect western China with Pakistan's Arabian Sea port of Gwadar. Pakistani officials have outlined to Reuters extensive security plans that include thousands-strong police protection forces, tighter monitoring of Chinese nationals, and in the province of Baluchistan - where the two teachers were kidnapped on May 24 - a review of security arrangements. The protection forces will buttress a 15,000-strong army division set up specifically to safeguard projects in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative, which has been credited with rejuvenating Pakistan's $300 billion economy.  We are already alert, but this incident has made us extra vigilant over Chinese security,  said Amin Yousafzai, deputy inspector general of police for the southern province of Sindh, which is home to about 50 million people. Sindh is raising a protection unit of about 2,600 police officers to help safeguard 4,000 Chinese working on CPEC projects, and another 1,000 working in other businesses. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which signed billions of dollars in contracts with Chinese companies, is also conducting a census of Chinese nationals and raising a force of about 4,200 officers to protect foreigners. Baluchistan would  review the whole security arrangement  and Chinese nationals who come in a private capacity should inform the authorities about their activities, said Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, spokesman for the provincial government. The number of militant attacks in Pakistan has fallen sharply in recent years, but violent Islamist groups still pose a threat, and in Baluchistan separatists opposed to CPEC also carry out attacks. The Islamic State killings were a rare attack on Chinese nationals in Pakistan, but the incident has unnerved Islamabad and the growing Chinese community.  Miftah Ismail, a state minister involved in CPEC planning, said Pakistan had devoted huge resources to improving security and Chinese investors should not be put off by a one-off attack.  The country's security situation has improved,  Ismail said. The scale of the task facing security agencies is increasing by the day as more Chinese entrepreneurs arrive to set up businesses. Most stay in big cities, but some venture into riskier areas. The challenge for authorities will increase in 2018, when the corridor is due to become operational and trucks ferrying goods to and from China cross more than 1,000 km (620 miles) of road in remote Baluchistan areas currently off-limits to foreigners. Protection Force The two Chinese-language teachers were kidnapped by gunmen  pretending to be police, but little else is known about how the they ended up in Baluchistan's provincial capital, Quetta. Baluchistan's government afterwards evacuated 11 other Chinese nationals based in the city.  There are no more Chinese living in Quetta , said Ahsan Mehboob, Baluchistan's inspector general of police. It was not clear why the 11 were there.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide bombings and gun attacks on parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on Wednesday. Iran's intelligence minister Mahmoud Alavi said on Saturday night that 43 suspects had been arrested and operations to identify and crush more  terrorists cells  were under way.  On Sunday, the head of the justice department in Kordestan province in western Iran announced more arrests.  Six people who were certainly connected to Wednesday's terrorist attacks in Tehran were identified and arrested,  Aliakbar Garousi was quoted as saying by the Fars news agency. Iran also said its security forces killed the mastermind of the attacks on Saturday.  The commander of this terrorist group was based in the border regions, but after the attacks left the country,  Alavi was quoted as saying by state broadcaster IRIB on Sunday.  However, with cooperation of (intelligence) services that are close to Iran, he paid the price of his crimes on Saturday and was killed by Iran's security forces and our friends in the other intelligence services,  he said. Iran's intelligence ministry said on Thursday that five of the gunmen and bombers were Iranian members of Islamic State who had fought in the militants' strongholds in Syria and Iraq.  Questions in Parliament  The attacks were the first claimed by Islamic State inside tightly controlled Shi'ite Iran, one of the powers leading the fight against the Sunni militants in the region. The Iranian lawmakers invited the intelligence minister, interior minister and also the deputy head of the Revolutionary Guards to the parliament to report on Sunday about the biggest security breach in the country in more than two decades.  The ministers should explain how terrorists managed to reach the capital and hit two sensitive targets. We are not satisfied with the answers given so far,  Asadullah Abbasi, a lawmaker was quoted as saying by judiciary's news agency, Mizan. Abbasi said the attacks were unprecedented since the killing of Iranian lawmakers in 1980s. In 1981, a bomb planted by an Iranian opposition group in Tehran killed 27 Iranian members of parliament and dozens of other officials. In Wednesday's attacks no member of the parliament was killed as the attackers were unable to reach the main building. Iranian lawmakers said the intelligence minister had assured them that  all Islamic state elements have been eliminated  in the country.

On June 20, global equity index compiler MSCI will announce whether it is putting Saudi Arabia on a list for possible upgrade to emerging market status. Index firm FTSE will decide in September whether to make Riyadh a secondary emerging market. Then in late 2018, authorities aim to list national oil giant Saudi Aramco in Riyadh, selling about 5 percent in what is likely to be the world's biggest initial public offer of shares. All three events promise to draw large flows of passive funds - money that benchmarks itself against international indexes - to Saudi Arabia, and by raising the kingdom's profile among global investors, attract a volume of active funds that could be even larger over the next couple of years. “Saudi Arabia will become tied to significant global capital flows. The market could be larger than Turkey, larger than Thailand, possibly larger than Mexico,” said Asha Mehta, portfolio manager at U.S. based-Acadian Asset Management, which manages over $77 billion of assets globally. Only about 60 institutions have become Qualified Foreign Investors in the Saudi bourse since it opened to direct foreign investment in mid 2015; the index changes and Aramco's listing could increase that number.  The process is gradual, but the boost to liquidity and market capitalisation in Saudi will make some institutions which have been hesitating decide to enter,  said Sandeep Srinivas, senior analyst at FIM Partners in Dubai. But there are signs the inflow of foreign money into Saudi Arabia may be slower than some investors are hoping, and that it may not trigger a strong rise in the Saudi market. Low oil prices are keeping buyers wary, while austerity steps planned by the government, as it confronts a huge budget deficit, will dampen corporate profits. Local regulations mean there may be little room left for foreigners to raise their stakes in some firms.  There are a wide range of factors that will dictate the market's direction over the next couple of years, not all of them necessarily positive,  said Simon Kitchen, head of macro strategy at regional investment bank EFG Hermes. Reflecting this, the Saudi stock index has dropped in the run-up to this month's MSCI decision; it is down 5 percent since the start of 2017. Flows After the exchange began in April to settle trades within two days of execution - the key remaining reform demanded by MSCI - most fund managers think the index compiler is likely to put Riyadh on its review list on June 20. The actual decision on whether to include Saudi Arabia in MSCI's emerging market index would then occur in mid 2018, and if MSCI follows past procedures, inclusion would occur in mid 2019. Kitchen estimated MSCI inclusion, not taking into account Aramco's listing, would bring $7.1 billion of passive inflows into Saudi stocks in mid 2019. So some analysts think a positive announcement by MSCI on June 20 will trigger an immediate inflow of active foreign funds.  We expect foreign funds to enter the Saudi market as soon as MSCI announces the watch list inclusion, and to gradually increase as we get closer to a potential implementation date,  said analysts at regional firm Arqaam Capital. If FTSE decides in September to upgrade Riyadh, changes in its indexes would probably occur in September 2018; this could bring $3.5 billion of passive funds. Aramco's listing would magnify MSCI- and FTSE-related passive inflows. Kitchen estimated the extra money at $4.8-9.6 billion, depending on whether Aramco achieved a valuation of $2 trillion as the government hopes, or about half that as some analysts believe possible. In addition, $12-31 billion of active funds could flow in if the index changes and Aramco's listing boost foreign ownership of Saudi stocks to the levels of neighbouring Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, Kitchen calculated. About 4.2 percent of the $432 billion Saudi market is currently owned by foreigners. The result could be inflows totalling over $50 billion in the next two or three years as Saudi Arabia's bourse becomes more international. But that could be offset by cash-strapped local institutions selling stocks. At about 14 times forward earnings, Saudi Arabia is not cheap compared with MSCI's group of global emerging market stocks, at 12.9 times. And the success of Riyadh's economic reforms, designed to restore growth to an economy shell-shocked by low oil prices, may not be clear for years.  Will global emerging market funds be underweight or overweight Saudi Arabia? We think an overweight on Saudi Arabia will depend on the successful implementation of the reform programme and will be gradual, hence active flow estimates should err on the side of caution,  Kitchen said.

British Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in an election on Thursday and is in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for support to form a new government.  Hogan, who is also a senior member of Ireland's ruling Fine Gael party, said the British election  clearly indicates that the notion of a hard Brexit has been rejected,  Ireland's Sunday Business Post newspaper reported.  He added, however, that anti-EU elements of May's Conservative Party might resist attempts to soften the party's tone. The DUP has shown signs of supporting Britain's place in the customs union, which allows industrial goods to move freely without customs duties or other restrictions, and a deal with the Northern Irish party would imply  a much more positive tone towards a soft Brexit,  he said.     I think there’s a strong possibility that the British government and the EU will make an agreement that will be as close as possible to what is presently there in the context of the Customs Union because I think they will see the implications [of not being in it].  Leaving the customs union would be  economic suicide  for the United Kingdom, he said.  The British government is reluctant to maintain full membership of the customs union, however, as that would prevent Britain from being able to strike separate trade pacts with countries such as the United States, Australia and China.  Hogan said another British election might be needed to give a government a mandate to make the difficult decisions required to secure a Brexit deal, as May was  very damaged  as a result of the poll.   It's very difficult to see how you can strike a reasonable outcome without another election and a stronger mandate for the negotiating team in Britain, whoever that may be,  he said.

He was released in the town of Zintan under an amnesty law passed by a parliament based in eastern Libya, lawyer Khaled al-Zaidi said on Sunday, adding that Saif was headed to another Libyan city that he could not name for security reasons. Saif, 44, is the most prominent of the late leader's children, and was touted by some as a reformist successor before the uprising six years ago in which Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed. It is unclear what, if any, role the younger Gaddafi could play in Libya, where a complex array of armed groups and competing governments are vying for control.  But Gaddafi loyalists outside Libya as well as some in the east of the country, where military commander Khalifa Haftar has been building power, have been pressing for Saif's release amid a push from former regime figures to reassert influence.  Saif's lawyer Zaidi said Saif could play an important part in national reconciliation efforts because he was popular in Libya:  He will play a pivotal and detailed role in this stage.  Zaidi told Reuters in an interview in Cairo that Saif would make a statement at some point and would not be turning himself in to the International Criminal Court, which is seeking his arrest. Earlier reports that Saif had been freed from Zintan turned out to be false and there have long been conflicting rumors about his status. No physical evidence of his whereabouts has been offered. Saif was last seen by an independent international observer in June 2014. Zintan's Abubaker Sadiq brigade, which was responsible for guarding Saif, said it had chosen to release him following requests from the justice ministry of a government based in eastern Libya that is a rival to the U.N.-backed one in the capital, Tripoli.

Sentenced to Death A Tripoli court sentenced Saif to death in absentia in 2015 for war crimes, including killing protesters during the revolution. A statement posted by the attorney general's office in Tripoli on Sunday said he was still wanted under that conviction and that an investigation had been launched into his reported release.  Slideshow (4 Images)Libya slid into turmoil after Muammar Gaddafi's overthrow, with rival governments and armed alliances competing for power. A U.N.-backed government in Tripoli has struggled to impose its authority and has been rejected by factions in the east. Zintan, which gained military importance through its role in the 2011 uprising and has been at odds with authorities in Tripoli, had refused to hand Saif over. He is also sought by the International Criminal Court, which says his trial in Libya did not meet international standards. It was unclear what terms Saif's captors might have set for his release, and why they would have freed a prisoner seen as a major bargaining chip. Zintan, about 145 km (90 miles) southwest of Tripoli, has its own divisions, but has been broadly aligned with the government and armed forces based in eastern Libya. However, a statement from Zintan's military and municipal councils strongly condemned the Abubaker Sadiq brigade's decision to release Saif. It said the move had  nothing to do with legal procedures, but is collusion and betrayal of the blood of the martyrs and the military institution that they claim to belong to . The defense and security committee of the eastern parliament criticized the move as well, showing that opinion among officials in the east is also split.

Organizers of the Resist March say the 3-mile (4.8km) walk will begin in Hollywood at 8 a.m. PDT (1500 GMT) and culminate with a rally in gay-friendly West Hollywood featuring U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and groups such as GLAAD, Planned Parenthood, Black Lives Matter and the American Civil Liberties Union.  This was not the year for parades. This was the year to take to the streets and march,  said Stephen Macias, a spokesman for the organizers.  The march is still about celebrating our community but its also about recognizing the climate we live in and the delicate balance around civil rights,  Macias said. The move has brought criticism from some in the Southern California gay community, who say the one day of the year set aside to celebrate their lives should not be given over to other political causes. It marks the second year in a row that Los Angeles Pride organizers have faced dissension. In 2016, some activists boycotted pride events on the grounds that they had lost their focus on the larger gay community to become a music festival catering largely younger people. Macias said the complaints about this year's Resist March were due largely to a misunderstanding about its intentions and that the weekend still would feature gay pride festivities across the Los Angeles area.  The march is still about celebrating our community but it's also about recognizing the climate we live in and the delicate balance around civil rights,  he said. Gay pride events are scheduled for major cities across the United States this month, some of them this weekend. In San Francisco, pride organizers have not dropped their parade in favor of a protest but the SF Weekly newspaper reported the event will include a  resistance contingent  and an immigrant rights speaker.

A decision by organizers to present a  National Freedom Hero  award to Oscar Lopez Rivera triggered a firestorm of criticism from politicians and police unions, and led a host of sponsors to pull out of the annual parade up Fifth Avenue. In the days following the announcement, the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the nation's largest police union, called for a boycott of the parade, an annual celebration by Americans with roots on the Caribbean island. Organizers expect 1.5 million to watch the Sunday's event in New York, the same day as the island holds a referendum on statehood for the U.S. territory. Some of the parade's major advertisers, including JetBlue Airways Corp and AT&T; Inc, pulled their sponsorships over Lopez Rivera's participation. Some said the conflict over the former FALN leader made them uncomfortable. With the controversy festering, the 74-year-old Lopez Rivera said earlier this month he would forgo the award.

Behind the scenes, de Blasio's office pushed Lopez Rivera to say he would not accept the hero's honor, according to the New York Times, reflecting the political pressure the mayor was under because of his decision to participate. The mayor's stance put him out of step with other prominent New York politicians, including Governor Andrew Cuomo, who said he would not march. In 1981, Lopez Rivera was convicted of sedition and other charges, along with other members of the Armed Forces of National Liberation, known by its Spanish-language acronym as FALN. U.S. authorities said the group was responsible for dozens of bombings in the 1970s and 1980s in a campaign to secure Puerto Rico's independence from the United States. Lopez Rivera, who was sentenced to 55 years in prison, plus 15 additional years for a foiled escape plot, was freed in January during President Barack Obama's final days in office. Lopez Rivera's supporters view him as a symbol of Puerto Rican nationalism and the campaign to end what they see as colonial status. Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory with 3.5 million residents, was acquired by the United States after the Spanish-American War. Lopez Rivera had been championed as a political prisoner by  Hamilton  playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and other celebrities. But critics of the decision to honor Rivera say he is a convicted criminal who helped carry out attacks on U.S. citizens and property, including the deadly 1975 bombing of New York's Fraunces Tavern. No one was ever charged in connection with that bombing. After Lopez Rivera declined the award, City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito said publicly she would find a way to honor him at the parade. Currently, a bankrupt Puerto Rico is struggling with $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and critically underfunded healthcare and pension systems. A federal oversight board appointed by U.S. Congress is managing its finances. Against that backdrop, Puerto Ricans on Sunday will cast votes on whether their struggling island should become the 51st U.S. state. Even if islanders vote in favor of the status referendum, Puerto Rico's fifth since 1967, statehood would require an act of the U.S. Congress.

Trial results released last week showed mixing Perjeta with Roche's established Herceptin treatment gave patients only a slight benefit.     The results hit Roche shares, and analysts said they increased the chance of the company's revenues suffering when its $7 billion-a-year blockbuster Herceptin, which was approved in 1998, is exposed to competition from cheaper rivals. When asked whether he had been too optimistic on Perjeta and misled investors in an update on the drug in March, Roche CEO Severin Schwan said:  No.   We are convinced that Perjeta will also play a significant role at an early breast cancer stage, where healing is possible,  he told Swiss weekly Sonntagszeitung.  The risk of suffering a relapse is reduced by nearly 20 percent by Perjeta, on patients with a high risk of relapse even more.      Schwan said Roche's business was performing well and he was confident the group would reach its full year targets. Roche has a 2017 target for a low- to mid-single-digit increase in sales, with similar growth in core earnings per share.

Finance Minister Michael Noonan, who is to step down once Varadkar is confirmed as Ireland's new prime minister by parliament next week, announced the creation of the contingency fund last year, with the first 1 billion euros to be put aside in 2019. The aim was to build up a fund that could be used to cushion against any future economic shock. Ireland's economy has posted the fastest growth in the European Union for the past three years, but economists have warned that a failure to invest in housing, transport and other infrastructure could damage the economy. Varadkar said a contingency fund had merit  in the longer term  once a planned capital investment plan had started to take effect, the newspaper reported.   We are a young country with a growing economy and we need room to expand,  Varadkar was quoted as saying by the newspaper.  Varadkar's office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Varadkar last month said he wanted to lower an ambitious debt reduction target set last year, in order to free up more funding for infrastructure projects. Noonan pledged last October to cut the state's debt as a proportion of gross domestic product to 45 percent by the mid-2020s or later, but Varadkar said he would amend the target to 55 percent of GDP to allow for greater capital investment. Ireland's debt-to-GDP fell below 80 percent from 94 percent at the stroke of a pen last year when GDP growth for 2015 was adjusted up to 26 percent after a massive revision to the stock of capital assets. The national debt remains among the highest in the euro zone by most other measures.

In Dubai, the largest listed property developer, Emaar Properties, rose 0.9 percent as investors continued to react positively to its plan to distribute funds from a listing of its local real estate developer to shareholders. The UAE, as part of its response to the diplomatic rift in the region, told local banks to apply  enhanced due diligence  to the Qatari institutions and instructed banks to stop dealing with 59 individuals and 12 entities with alleged links to Qatar. Five of the six Doha-based banks named are listed on the stock market: Qatar National Bank, Qatar Islamic Bank , Qatar International Islamic Bank, Masraf Al Rayan and Doha Bank. Shares in all of them fell on Sunday with the largest, QNB, down 1.0 percent. Qatari banks have about 60 billion riyals ($16.5 billion) in funding in the form of customer and interbank deposits from other Gulf states, SICO Bahrain estimated, and the banks account for just over half the Qatari stock market's value. Although the UAE stopped short of a blanket ban on dealings with Qatar, its move could have much the same effect if UAE banks - and perhaps those in other countries - reduce their exposure to Qatari institutions for fear of getting caught in the diplomatic crisis. Shares in Barwa Real Estate were down 4.9 percent and the Qatari stock index fell 1.3 percent on Sunday morning. Last week, the Doha index shed 7.1 percent. In Abu Dhabi, the banking sector helped carry the index 0.5 percent higher. First Abu Dhabi Bank - the second largest bank in the region by assets after QNB - was 0.9 percent higher. The Dubai index was almost flat, however, as nine shares rose along with Emaar but 15 declined. The Riyadh index was flat, weighed down by the petrochemical sector as Brent oil stayed near a one- month low. Propylene maker Yanbu National Petrochemicals was down 0.4 percent.

The IAAF president watched Bolt cruise to victory in the 100 meters at the national stadium in Kingston on Saturday, the 30-year-old bidding farewell to more than 30,000 spectators at his last meeting on home soil. Coe, who won back-to-back 1,500 meters golds among four Olympic medals, said no other sprinter could compare to the eight-times Olympic champion, who will bow out at the world championships in London.  When you're sitting in the pub and you’re having the discussion: who is the greatest footballer? Nobody will agree on that,  Coe told Reuters in an interview.  If you have the same discussion around golf or tennis, everybody will have different views.  It’s a slam dunk. (Bolt) is the greatest sprinter the world has ever seen.  If you look at the records he set, if you look at the Olympic championships he’s had -- three in a row -- I’m not sure I’m ever going to see that in my lifetime.

Coe said the 100 and 200 meters world record holder would have a bigger challenge in life after competition.  The second leg of his journey, the biggest challenge athletics has, the biggest challenge the Olympic movement has, is for young people to feel what we offer is relevant to their lives,  the 60-year-old Briton said.

Coe was thrilled to see Bolt make his last run on home soil. “There’s nowhere else on this planet that I would rather be tonight, than here, this was the must see moment and I’m not just saying that as the president of the world sport, I’m saying this as a fan,” he added. “This guy has transformed our sport, he’s connected with young people, he’s connected with people that didn’t even think they liked track and field, he’s turned them into lifelong fans and every single plaudit that he receives tonight, he’s deserving of every syllable of it.

Trump,James Comey,N. R. Narayana Murthy,Theresa May,INDIA,MARKETS,WEEKAHEAD","sector":"","content":"REUTERS - Some of the most awaited events of month took place in the past week but they failed to meaningfully sway the stock markets. The RBI maintained status quo as expected while the UK election threw up an unexpected outcome. The main indexes ended flat as a result. A dramatic general election in Britain resulted in voters stripping the ruling Conservatives of their parliamentary majority. Prime Minister Theresa May managed to secure a deal on Saturday to prop up her minority government, tentatively pacifying concerns over the immediate future of UK politics and the looming start of Brexit negotiations with the European Union.  In the U.S., the testimony of former FBI Director James Comey regarding his interactions with President Donald Trump failed to provide any new or substantive information. U.S. markets shrugged off the event and the Dow touched new record highs. In India, the RBI kept its key repo rate unchanged at 6.25 percent and lowered its inflation forecast. The Monetary Policy Committee also revised downwards the FY18 GVA growth rate by 10 bps to 7.3 percent. The relatively dovish stance renews the possibility of rate cuts in future.  Meanwhile, Fitch ratings said Indian banks' exposure to troubled telecom companies is not large enough to pose a systemic threat, but defaults could add to problems at banks with weak balance sheets.  Total debt owed by telcos to banks stands at 913 billion rupees, accounting for just 1.4 percent of all bank loans. However, the rollout of 5G in the next 2-3 years may further add to their woes. Infosys was buzzing with action on media reports that co-founder Narayana Murthy and other promoters are exploring a sale of their entire 12.75 percent stake in the company worth about 280 billion rupees.  The move is said to have been triggered by their unhappiness over how the company is being managed since their exit three years ago. Murthy denied any plans to sell his stake but the company’s stocks corrected sharply. ONGC was also in the limelight on reports that it may buy the government’s entire stake in HPCL, in line with the oil ministry’s proposal of creating a domestic oil giant. The acquisition is likely to make ONGC a much more integrated player with presence in the downstream segment. In other stock- and sector-specific news, IRDA has denied permission to the proposed merger of Max Life and HDFC Standard Life.  SBI successfully raised 150 billion rupees by selling 522 million shares through QIP, which is India’s largest till date. PSU banks’ stocks were in focus after reports that the government was examining the possibility of further consolidation in the space without waiting for their finances to improve.  On the macro front, the Nikkei India Services PMI rose to 52.2 in May from 50.2 in April, which was the fastest increase in four months. The state weather department has upgraded its monsoon forecast to 98 percent of its long term average from an earlier 96 percent, a huge boost to India’s rain-dependent economy.  Globally, the ECB left interest rates unchanged and continued to expect interest rates “to remain at present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon” of its asset-buying programme, which is set to run at least through December.  The U.S. non-farm payrolls data was lower than expected, suggesting that the labour market was losing momentum. In the coming week, India’s IIP data for April along with CPI data for May is expected to be announced on Monday. WPI data for May is expected to be released on Wednesday.  Globally, investors will react to the fallout from the UK election and the ongoing Trump-Comey saga in the U.S.  On the macro data front, China's IIP data for May and Japan and the euro zone's IIP data for April will be released Wednesday.  The U.S. Fed will also make its highly anticipated rate decision on Wednesday. Markets are expecting a rate hike despite a weaker-than-expected jobs report a few days back. The big reform rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) is about three weeks away. Though murmurs of possible disruptions due to a new tax regime are getting louder, stock investors are yet to take cognizance of the same.  However, markets seem to be getting tired at the present levels and are failing to gain momentum. This puts a question on how stocks will behave the moment we get negative new flows. With the GST implementation on the horizon, it would be prudent to maintain liquidity and wait for the upcoming disruption-led correction in markets to accumulate at lower levels.

The nominee, Song Young-moo, was well suited to deal with North Korea's nuclear and missile threat, the presidential Blue House office said.  Under third-generation leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has been conducting missile tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the mainland United States.  The North test-launched a new type of its cruise anti-ship missiles on Thursday, its fourth missile test since the South's Moon took office on May 10, pledging to engage in dialogue with Pyongyang. Song, who served in the navy for more than three decades, was Moon's main security adviser during his presidential campaign, reprising his role in Moon's 2012 presidential campaign.  A decorated veteran, Song took part in a 2009 skirmish between North and South Korean naval vessels off the western coast of the Korean peninsula. Song's appointment does not need parliament's approval, but he must attend a hearing and answer questions from lawmakers. The Blue House said Song admitted to having falsely registered his residence information in the past, a criminal offense in South Korea. Many of Moon's ministerial choices have faced an uphill battle in parliament on this and other ethical issues, and lawmakers are likely to grill Song the same way. He is expected to cooperate with the United States, the country's major military ally, to respond to the North's growing missile threat. The government has said it will not change a pact with the United States for the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea, despite its decision to put on hold the full installation pending an environmental impact review. Moon also tapped a human rights expert as justice minister tasked with reforming the prosecutors' office, the president's office said. Ahn Kyong-whan, the former chairman of South Korea's Human Rights Commission, now heads a non-profit legal foundation, but has no background as a prosecutor, unusual in a candidate for  the ministerial role.

May's Downing Street office said on Sunday she had spoken with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), to discuss finalising a deal when parliament is reconvened next week.  We will welcome any such deal being agreed, as it will provide the stability and certainty the whole country requires as we embark on Brexit and beyond,  Downing Street said in a statement.  As and when details are finalised both parties will put them forward,  it said, referring to May's Conservative Party and the DUP. The Conservatives won 318 House of Commons seats in the election, eight short of an outright majority. The DUP won 10 seats. May had called the snap election with a view to increasing the narrow majority she had inherited from her predecessor David Cameron. At the start of the campaign, she was enjoying poll leads of 20 points or more over the main opposition Labour Party. But after a poor campaign and an unexpectedly stiff challenge from the opposition Labour Party under leader Jeremy Corbyn, her plan went disastrously wrong, leaving her unable to form a sustainable government without DUP support. The timing is challenging, with Britain due to start negotiating the terms of its exit from the European Union with the bloc's 27 other members on June 19. The Conservatives now plan to reach a so-called confidence and supply agreement with the DUP, which would involve it supporting a Conservative minority government on key votes in parliament but not forming a formal coalition. After an initial round of discussions, Downing Street had said on Saturday that the  principles of an outline agreement  had been agreed with the DUP. The DUP itself later issued a statement saying the talks had been positive, but stopped short of confirming a deal had been sealed.  The DUP today (Saturday) held discussions with representatives of the Conservative Party in line with Arlene Foster's commitment to explore how we might bring stability to the nation at this time of great challenge,  the party said.  The talks so far have been positive. Discussions will continue next week to work on the details and to reach agreement on arrangements for the new parliament.

Her Conservatives struck an outline deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for support on key legislation. It was a humiliating outcome after an election that May had intended to strengthen her ahead of the Brexit push. Instead, voters stripped the Conservatives of their parliamentary majority. As May struggled to contain the fallout, her two closest aides resigned.  Newspapers said foreign minister Boris Johnson and other leading party members were weighing leadership challenges. But Johnson said he backed May. May called the early election in April, when opinion polls suggested she was set for a sweeping win. May's aides, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill quit on Saturday following sustained criticism within the party of the campaign.  Gavin Barwell was named new chief of staff. The Conservative lawmaker who lost his seat on Thursday and has experience working as a party enforcer in parliament. The change was unlikely to significantly quell unrest within the party. Most of May's cabinet members have kept quiet on the issue of her future, adding to speculation that her days as prime minister are numbered. A YouGov poll for the Sunday Times newspaper found 48 percent of people felt May should quit while 38 percent thought she should stay. More Complicated The DUP, whose 10 seats in the new parliament give May just enough support to pass legislation, agreed in principle to a  confidence and supply  arrangement, Downing Street said. That means it will support a Conservative minority government on key votes in parliament without a formal coalition deal. Related CoverageNorthern Ireland's DUP says still to reach agreement on supporting UK PM May's governmentA source close to the DUP said the party was seeking more funding for the province and concessions for former British soldiers in exchange for supporting May. Still the deal with the DUP risks upsetting the political balance in Northern Ireland. It aligns London more closely with the pro-British side in the divided province, where a power-sharing government with Irish nationalists is suspended. The Observer newspaper said the DUP arrangement fell short of a full coalition agreement because of concerns among some Conservative lawmakers about the socially conservative DUP's positions on gay rights, abortion and climate change. The turmoil engulfing May has increased the chance that Britain will fall out of the EU in 2019 without a deal. Previously, she said she wanted to take Britain out of the EU's single market and customs union in order to cut immigration.     Her party is deeply divided over what it wants from Brexit. The election result means businesses still have no idea what trading rules they can expect in the coming years.   EU Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said it may now be possible to discuss closer ties between Britain and the EU than May had initially planned, given her election flop.  Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May addresses the country after Britain's election at Downing Street in London, Britain June 9, 2017.Stefan Wermuth For instance, if London were to stay in the customs union, then it would not have to renegotiate all trade agreements,  he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.  The pound on Friday fell 1.7 percent against the U.S. dollar and 1.4 percent against the euro. After confirming on Friday that her top five ministers, including finance minister Philip Hammond, would keep their jobs, May must name the rest of her team, who will take on one of the most demanding jobs in recent British political history.  May has said Brexit talks will begin on June 19 as scheduled, the same day as the formal reopening of parliament. She confirmed this to German leader Angela Merkel in a phone call on Saturday.  She also reiterated that she would seek a reciprocal agreement early in the talks on rights of EU and British citizens, Downing Street said.      Elmar Brok, a German conservative and the European Parliament's top Brexit expert, told the Ruhr Nachrichten newspaper that the two-year talks would now be more complicated.  Slideshow (5 Images) May won't be able to make any compromises because she lacks a broad parliamentary majority,  he said.  She's Staying - for Now   Britain's largely pro-Conservative press questioned whether May could remain in power.  The Sun newspaper said senior members of the party had vowed to get rid of May, but would wait at least six months because they feared a leadership contest could propel the Labour party into power under Jeremy Corbyn, who supports renationalization of key industries and higher taxes for business and top earners. Survation, the opinion polling firm that came closest to predicting correctly the election's outcome, said a new poll it conducted for the Mail on Sunday newspaper showed support for Labour now 6 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives.     She's staying, for now,  one Conservative Party source told Reuters. Former Conservative cabinet minister Owen Paterson, asked about her future, said:  Let's see how it pans out.  May had repeatedly ruled out the need for a new election before changing her mind. Labour stunned even its own supporters by taking enough seats from the Conservatives to deny them a majority. The Times newspaper's front page declared that Britain was  effectively leaderless  and the country  all but ungovernable .  The Conservatives have not yet broken the British system of democracy, but through their hubris and incompetence they have managed to make a mockery of it,  it said in an editorial.  If May is to honor the wish of the 52 percent of voters who opted last year to take Britain out of the EU, she must find a way to bridge the differences within her party. Its eurosceptic wing has long been a thorn in the side of Conservative prime ministers. On the other hand, pro-Europe Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said she wanted to be involved in  looking again  at Britain's aims for Brexit. Davidson was one of the few Conservative success stories in the election as the Scottish wing of the party won 13 seats.  She has said she favors retaining the greatest possible level of access to Europe's single market. Davidson also said she had received reassurances from May that the party's deal with the DUP would not involve a rollback of gay rights.

The order came as the UAE told local banks to stop dealing with 59 individuals and 12 entities with alleged links to Qatar and to freeze all their assets. The six Qatari banks - Qatar National Bank, Qatar Islamic Bank, Qatar International Islamic Bank , Barwa Bank (IPO-BABK.QA), Masraf Al Rayan and Doha Bank - did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Although the UAE stopped short of imposing a blanket ban on bank dealings with Qatar, its move could have much the same effect if UAE banks - and perhaps those in other countries - cut back their exposure to Qatari institutions for fear of getting caught up in the region's diplomatic crisis. Qatari banks have around 60 billion riyals ($16.5 billion) in funding in the form of customer and interbank deposits from other Gulf states, according to SICO Bahrain, and they account for a little over half of the Qatari stock market's value. Qatari banks are expected to be able to obtain funds from their central bank if needed, but any pull-out of deposits could still be awkward for them.  Last week some investors saw the sharp falls in share prices as an opportunity to buy some banks because valuations are good, but the weekend news developments put banks in a tough spot,  said one regional portfolio manager. He said he expected foreign funds to be sellers in Qatar on Sunday. Last week the Doha index shed 7.1 percent.

Footage of the late Saturday protests shared on social media showed hundreds, if not thousands, of demonstrators holding placards and shouting slogans while marching along Nanjing Road, a glitzy shopping strip in the city centre. One video seen by Reuters showed police setting up blockades and dragging a demonstrator away. Media carried no reports of the demonstrations, while mentions of the protests on social media were scrubbed by internet censors. Shanghai police did not respond to requests for comment. Two witnesses told Reuters about 10 of the protesters who were hoisting banners and appeared to be leading the demonstrations were taken away by police.  One whole side of the street in front of the Apple store was filled with people,  said one nearby stall owner who declined to be identified, adding the crowd gathered around 8 p.m. and dispersed by 10 p.m.  The police came and took the leaders away.  Protesters were angry about measures announced on May 17 by Shanghai's housing bureau to  clean-up and rectify  commercial office projects that had been converted into apartments to cater for residential needs, in a grey area property developers previously exploited by acquiring land at cheaper prices than residential-zoned land. The government measures, part of a bid to keep property speculation and soaring real estate prices in check, required developers and buyers to rectify violations such as separately installed toilets and kitchens before they are able to be sold on, effectively rendering them uninhabitable and worth a fraction of the purchase price. A total of 17 million square metres of such projects are targeted by the campaign, the Shanghai government said on its social media account, of which 5 million square metres have been delivered to buyers.  They are shouting for their only home in Shanghai, bought by their whole family's savings through legal means,  one person said in a Weibo social media post, which was later deleted.  This year the government suddenly changed policies, saying it's not allowed to live in there, leaving hundreds of thousands of ordinary homeowners unable to normally sell their homes.

The coordinated move suggests the Gulf states are seeking to lessen the humanitarian impact of their June 5 severing of ties with Qatar, in retaliation for what they call its support for terrorism and their regional foe Iran. Qatar has called the accusations baseless and have described the measures as a  siege  harmful to ordinary people there. The three countries' news agencies did not make clear what services the hotline would provide. Amnesty International on June 9 criticized the measures against Qatar as sweeping and arbitrary and said they had split up families and destroyed peoples' livelihoods and education. Until the political dispute, which has cut air links and banned Qataris from visiting the three countries, Gulf societies enjoyed close travel ties and many families are intermarried. But authorities in the UAE and Bahrain have made praise for  Qatar's government a criminal offense carrying possible jail time, and some Gulf citizens have worried that the strong rhetoric on Qatar's foreign policy would divide their peoples.

The source said it is not clear that the board will make any decision to change Kalanick’s role. The board is expected to adopt a number of internal policy and management changes recommended by outside attorneys hired to investigate sexual harassment and the firm's broader culture. The outside lawyers made no recommendation about Kalanick. The meeting, which Uber has not publicized, could be a pivotal moment for the world's most valuable venture-backed private company, which has upended the tightly regulated taxi industry in many countries but has run into legal trouble with a rough-and-tumble approach to local regulations and the way it handles employees and drivers. At the Sunday meeting, according to two people familiar with the matter, the seven voting members of Uber's board, including Kalanick, are expected to vote on recommendations made by the law firm of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, which conducted a review of the company's policies and culture. The review was launched in February after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published a blog post detailing what she described as sexual harassment and the lack of a suitable response by senior managers. Fowler now works for digital payments company Stripe. Uber's board will likely tell employees and the public of its decisions by Tuesday, one of the sources said. An Uber spokesman had no comment. Neither Kalanick nor Holder's law firm, Covington & Burling, immediately responded to requests for comment late Saturday. Kalanick has developed a reputation as an abrasive leader, and his approach has rubbed off on his company. The 40-year-old executive was captured on video in February berating an Uber driver. Uber board member Arianna Huffington said in March that Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a  scrappy entrepreneur  to be more like a  leader of a major global company.  The board has been looking for a chief operating officer to help Kalanick run the company since March. The report was prepared by Holder and partner Tammy Albarrán at Covington & Burling. It comes shortly after another law firm, Perkins Coie, submitted a separate report on sexual harassment and other employee concerns at the company. On Tuesday, Uber responded to that report's findings by saying it had fired 20 employees for a variety of reasons, and was increasing training and adopting new policies. Uber said that report considered 215 cases encompassing sexual harassment, discrimination, unprofessional behavior, bullying and other employee complaints. More Oversight on Ceo? San Francisco-based Uber is valued at nearly $70 billion but has yet to turn a profit. Some of the recommendations in Holder's firm's report would force greater controls on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Kalanick have had a surprising amount of autonomy for a company with more than 12,000 employees, one person familiar with the matter said. Uber's more than 1.5 million drivers worldwide are classified as independent contractors rather than employees. Less clear is the fate of Kalanick, who with close allies has voting control of the company. The person briefed on the matter said the board will discuss Kalanick taking time off from the company. The discussion involved the possibility that Kalanick might return in a role with less authority, this person said, either in a position other than CEO or as CEO with narrower responsibilities and subject to stronger oversight. Kalanick is also facing a personal trauma: his mother died last month in a boating accident, in which his father was also badly injured. Holder Interviews Employees and former employees interviewed by Holder's team complained about sexual and racial bias, bullying and retaliation, according to people familiar with their accounts. They said that Kalanick and his lieutenants had favorites who played by different rules than other employees, and that even those favorites were nervous that they could fall from grace, which they sometimes did. Uber declined comment on that characterization. One of the issues that came to Holder’s team's attention, according to two people familiar with the matter, was the company’s handling of a crisis in India after one of its drivers was arrested for raping a customer. Though the man was convicted in 2015, Kalanick and other executives became convinced that the crime was a set up by a local competitor, former employees said. Eric Alexander, the head of Asian business, shared medical records internally that he argued showed that the woman had been assaulted but not raped, people who spoke to him said. Alexander was fired this week; he did not return messages seeking comment. Uber confirmed Alexander had left the company but declined to discuss the matter further.

The unit will be within a maximum-security prison and have capacity for 54 inmates, who will be isolated and intensely monitored, said the state's Premier Gladys Berejiklian   We'll be giving $47 million over the next three years to have the extra capacity to isolate those prisoners who are likely to try a spread radicalization through the prison network,  Berejiklian told reporters. There are 33 people within the New South Wales’ prison system who have been jailed for terrorist offences, the state government said. Australia has seen a series of “lone wolf” Islamist-inspired attacks recently, prompting a review of police tactics and the powers of state and federal authorities.  We’re a government taking nothing to chance, we'll be making sure we continue to have the toughest position in the nation in relation to reducing and eliminating terrorism activity,  Berejiklian said. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last week signaled a drive to reform parole laws, including a ban on parole for violent offenders with links to militancy, following a deadly siege claimed by the Islamic State group on Monday. Police shot dead gunman Yacqub Khayre, who was on parole for a violent home invasion, in the city of Melbourne after he killed a man in an apartment block and held a woman hostage for several hours. Turnbull and Attorney-General George Brandis both launched stinging criticism of state governments, which are responsible for parole laws, after the Melbourne attack. Australia passed laws last year allowing the indefinite detention of anyone convicted of terror-related offences if authorities believed that person posed a threat after their release. On Thursday, police in New South Wales were granted the authority to shoot suspects in terrorist-related incidents even if the attacker does not pose an imminent threat. Currently, police have to wait until a suspect demonstrates an imminent threat to others. The change comes after questions were raised about the police strategy of  contain and negotiate  in hostage situations. A coroner said last month police had failed to act quickly enough to tackle a 2014 siege in a Sydney cafe. Three people including the hostage-taker were killed in the incident, Australia's most deadly violence inspired by Islamist militants.

Trump,Hillary Clinton,James Comey,John Cusack,Naomi Klein.Still,Nick Brana,US,USA,PROGRESSIVES,General News,Illinois,Health / Medicine,US Government News,Government / Politics,Corporate Events,United States","sector":"Politics","content":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Buoyed by the British Labour Party election gains this week, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday urged a summit of progressive activists who propelled his presidential candidacy to ramp up efforts to win elections and help remake a Democratic Party he deemed a failure.  They won those seats by standing up to the ruling class,  he said, referring to the British elections and citing wins by progressive U.S. candidates in several state and local races while writing off losses as evidence liberal progressives could still be competitive even in conservative states. But Sanders, who lost the Democratic nomination nearly a year ago to Hillary Clinton, showed little interest in a push by  Draft Bernie  activists who want him to start his own  People's Party.  Many activists blame establishment Democrats for losing to President Donald Trump by failing to embrace a more populist left-leaning agenda. Sanders headlined the three-day  People's Summit  in Chicago, attended by celebrity activists including actors Danny Glover and John Cusack, which brought together main progressive groups such as National Nurses United, Democratic Socialists of America and People for Bernie.  Many activists said they hoped to transform the momentum from recent protests such as January's Women's March in Washington into concrete plans to support a growing wave of grassroots candidates to secure electoral power. People attend a speech by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at the  People's Summit , an annual gathering of influential progressive groups, in Chicago, Illionois, U.S. June 10, 2017.Chris Kenning We could have 10,000 people marching, but if we don't have some means of translating that into winning political office and enacting a legislative progressive agenda, at the end of the day, what does it amount to?  said Nick Brana, the former staffer for the Sanders campaign leading the  Draft Bernie  group. With Trump mired in controversy over incidents such as the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, and Democrats having lost ground in statehouses and in Congress, RoseAnn Demoro, head of the nurses union, said the movement Sanders began was at a  tipping point  of broadening its support. Leaders with the Democratic Socialists of America said their membership has bloomed from 6,000 before the election to 22,000. Others warned that progressives don’t have the fundraising firepower they need or that gains were still fledgling.  We're closer but we're not yet winning,  said activist and writer Naomi Klein. Still, Sanders credited progressives with increasing public acceptance of proposals such as a $15 minimum wage, renegotiating trade policies and offering free college tuition. He got a standing ovation when he said the California Senate recently passed a single-payer health care plan.

The vote comes at a time of economic hardship for the island, hamstrung by $70 billion in debt, a 45-percent poverty rate, woefully underperforming schools, and near-insolvent pension and health systems. Puerto Rico's hazy political status, dating back to its 1898 acquisition by the United States from Spain, has contributed to the economic crisis that pushed it last month into the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.  Statehood hasn't come in the past 120 years. Why would Donald Trump want to make this bankrupt island a state now? It will be another 120 years before that happens,  said Miriam Gonzalez, a 66-year-old retiree in San Juan. Heading into the plebiscite, Puerto Ricans mingling on the quaint and narrow streets of old San Juan were divided over the three options they will face on Sunday's ballot: becoming a U.S. state; remaining a territory; or becoming an independent nation, with or without some continuing political association with the United States. Under the current system, Puerto Rico's 3.5 million American citizens do not pay federal taxes, vote for U.S. presidents or receive proportionate federal funding on programs like Medicaid, though the U.S. government oversees policy and financial areas such as infrastructure, defense and trade. Puerto Rico's recently elected governor Ricardo Rossello campaigned last year on holding a referendum. Rossello's New Progressive Party (PNP) party, which controls Puerto Rico's government, is premised on a pro-statehood stance, while the opposition Popular Democratic Party (PPD) supports versions of the current territory status and a third party, the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP), supports independence. A spokesman for the governor told Reuters he will push Congress to respect a result in favor of statehood, but Puerto Rico is seen as a low priority in Washington. The status referendum is Puerto Rico's fifth since 1967. Statehood won in the last referendum in 2012, though PPD leaders instructed constituents to leave blank hundreds of thousands of ballots, calling the result into question.  Statehood isn't going to happen and the status quo is a trap,  said 23-year-old engineering and economics student Daniel Montalvo.  At this point, I think gradual independence is the best option.
