Doctors at the Cincinnati hospital who began treating Mr. Warmbier six days ago, said he suffered extensive loss of brain tissue and was in a state of \u201cunresponsive wakefulness.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, the awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured that no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today,\u201d his family said in the statement, released by the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.\u201cWe hold North Korea accountable for Otto Warmbier\u2019s unjust imprisonment, and demand the release of three other Americans who have been illegally detained,\u201d Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       said in a statement Monday.North Korea\u2019s office at the United Nations didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death. North Korea said through its state media that it released Mr. Warmbier on humanitarian grounds. A North Korean official said at a forum in Mongolia last week that he was punished because he sought to overthrow the North Korean regime.South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who took office last month, is set to visit the White House next week. He and President       Donald Trump       are expected to discuss economic issues and \u201ccoordinate on North Korea-related issues, including countering the growing North Korean nuclear and missile threats,\u201d the White House said last week.Mr. Trump said in a statement: \u201cOtto\u2019s fate deepens my administration\u2019s determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency. The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim.\u201dThe U.S. has few new options, but officials have said it could turn to so-called secondary sanctions, which would target companies that do business with North Korea in a no-holds-barred effort to economically isolate the country. Washington often has warned it could take such steps, but has held back in the face of Chinese opposition.While U.S. laws block virtually all trade with North Korea, United Nations resolutions don\u2019t go nearly as far. China, which is North Korea\u2019s largest trading partner, has said it would only follow these international statutes.Another last-resort move would be to eliminate travel by Americans to North Korea, a step U.S. officials previously have considered but set aside, although the State Department strongly discourages people from traveling there. A bipartisan bill in the House of Representatives would block U.S. citizens from traveling to North Korea for tourism, and Rep.       Ed Royce       (R., Calif.), the chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, called Monday for the ban to be enacted.Mr. Tillerson told lawmakers last week that the State Department is examining such a ban, an extremely rare measure, but hasn\u2019t made a final decision.The North Koreans detained the University of Virginia student at the Pyongyang airport in January 2016 as he was preparing to leave, and sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly defacing a political poster while on tour there.On Monday, Young Pioneer Tours, the China-based company offering \u201cbudget tours\u201d to North Korea that organized Mr. Warmbier\u2019s trip to Pyongyang, said Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death had \u201cled us to reconsider our position on accepting American tourists.\u201dThough North Korea is isolated, roughly 5,000 Western tourists visit the reclusive nation each year.Mr. Warmbier\u2019s family had no information about their son for over a year until learning this month that he was in a coma, his father, Fred Warmbier, said last week. At a secret meeting, North Koreans told U.S. officials that Mr. Warmbier lost consciousness after contracting botulism and taking a sleeping pill, U.S. officials and family members have said.Sen. Ed Markey (D., Mass.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said \u201cthe North Korean authorities must account for exactly what happened to Mr. Warmbier while he was in their custody and ensure that anyone who is responsible for his death is brought to justice.\u201d\u200bSen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the U.S. \u201ccannot and should not tolerate the murder of its citizens by hostile powers.\u201dDoctors treating Mr. Warmbier said they couldn\u2019t firmly say what caused Mr. Warmbier\u2019s brain injury, citing the limited information about his condition from North Korea. Speaking at a press conference last week, his physicians said it appeared he suffered the brain injury at least 14 months ago, and that the damage was consistent with cardiopulmonary arrest. Intoxication or trauma might cause cardiopulmonary arrest in someone as young as the University of Virginia student, his doctors said.Mr. Warmbier\u2019s family said that when their son returned to Cincinnati he was unable to speak, see or react to verbal commands.\u201cHe looked very uncomfortable\u2014almost anguished,\u201d the family said. \u201cAlthough we would never hear his voice again, within a day the countenance of his face changed\u2014he was at peace. He was home and we believe he could sense that.\u201dRaised near Cincinnati, Mr. Warmbier graduated in 2013 near the top of his class at Wyoming High School in Wyoming, Ohio. At the University of Virginia, he double-majored in economics and commerce with a concentration in finance, and minored in global sustainability, according to the website of a student-run group last year.His social media accounts at the time of his capture showed that Mr. Warmbier was into vintage clothing, running and rap music. A             Facebook                   page that appeared to be his shows him mugging casually with friends; in one image he is nose-to-snout with a cow. The Facebook page was taken down Jan. 22, 2016, the day North Korea announced it had arrested and was detaining him.Mr. Warmbier was on track to graduate from UVA this May, had he not been detained. The school \u201cwill not forget one of our own,\u201d school president Teresa Sullivan said in a tweet Monday.Mr. Warmbier ventured abroad to Europe and London before his trip to North Korea.\u201cI am proud of Otto and the courage he showed by going to North Korea and having that adventurous side to him,\u201d Mr. Warmbier\u2019s father said in a press conference last week. \u201cAnd so the fact that he was taken and treated this way is horrible and it is tough to process.\u201d\u2014Jonathan Cheng contributed to this article.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com and Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Ex-Prisoner Warmbier Dies.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 23:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/otto-warmbier-american-detainee-released-by-north-korea-has-died-1497905282", "news_title": "Otto Warmbier, American Detainee Released by North Korea, Has Died ", "keywords": "brain damaged,brain dead,cincinnati hospital,coma,north korea detainee,north korea sanctions,otto warmbier,political prisoner,pyongyang,returned home,University of Virginia,University of Cincinnati,Otto Warmbier,political,general news,international relations,education,politics,university,college,internet,online,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "The calm that has descended on U.S. financial markets is stretching around the world.Based on one commonly used measure, Asian equities are near their least volatile this century\u2014a byproduct of improving corporate earnings, stabilizing economic growth and the diminishing impact of geopolitical events on markets.In the U.S., Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d is near all-time lows, and in Europe, volatility has also largely subsided.\u201cThis is a global dynamic,\u201d said       Michael Parker,        head of strategy, Asia-Pacific at Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. \u201cYou see low volatility everywhere.\u201dBy contrast, sharp gyrations in Chinese markets early last year caused a spike in volatility around the globe.In Asia, Mr. Parker cites the MSCI Asia ex-Japan stock index, a broad measure of regional performance\u2014weighted most heavily to China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and India\u2014that has risen 19% this year. The index\u2019s 90-day realized volatility, a measure of historical moves over that period, has fallen to 8.2%, near its lowest since at least 2000, according to Mr. Parker, and down by nearly half from a year ago. Only in summer 2014 was this volatility gauge lower.Realized volatility is a measure of how much share prices move around. At this percentage, it shows that the market has moved by about 0.5% a day on average over the measured time frame.Another sign of calm is the lack of major daily declines: Since January 2016, the index has fallen more than 3% in one day just once. By comparison, in the prior two bull markets\u2014September 2001-October 2007 and March 2009-May 2011\u2014there were 3% daily declines on average every two to three months.Mr. Parker reckons that investors haven\u2019t had to contend with as many \u201cbinary events,\u201d such as China\u2019s surprise devaluation of August 2015, which sent shock waves through global markets. Signs of healthier consumer demand and strengthening industrial profits regionally have helped bolster equities. \u201cBroad fears around China imploding and capital fleeing have abated,\u201d he said.Global index provider MSCI is expected to decide this week whether to include China\u2019s domestically traded A-shares in its indexes. In prior years, MSCI said mainland stocks weren\u2019t accessible or transparent enough to warrant inclusion. A different decision this time would increase the China exposure of the many global investors who invest based on MSCI indexes.Low volatility has swept across asset classes globally. In the U.S., the             CBOE                   Volatility Index, or VIX, closed Friday at 10.38, near its lowest level since 1993. The VSTOXX index of eurozone equity volatility, a European variation of the VIX, was also near a record low.For now, few see any reason for the low volatility to end.Investors will likely continue to watch China closely, analysts at             Goldman Sachs                   said in a note last week. Policy makers there have recently been trying to tamp down leverage in the country\u2019s financial system, and any \u201cover-tightening\u2026could exacerbate the mild growth slowdown so far,\u201d Goldman said.As for U.S. prospects, the Federal Reserve\u2019s failure to raise rates as fast as it earlier forecast has made investors skeptical about the pace of increases it forecasts now. That could leave markets open to \u201chawkish surprises\u201d later this year if U.S. growth doesn\u2019t disappoint, Goldman said.Write to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 23:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-volatility-has-vanished-around-the-world-1497860894", "news_title": "Market Volatility Has Vanished Around the World", "keywords": "fear index,market calm,market volatility,stock-market volatility,volatility,political,general news,risk news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "Meal delivery startup Freshly Inc. has raised new funding amidst large changes in the meal delivery sector.Roughly a year after its last funding, Freshly has closed a $77 million Series C round led by new investor Nestl\u00e9 USA, which is part of the transnational food and beverage company.Existing investors including Highland Capital Partners, Insight Venture Partners, and White Star Capital also participated in the round, which increased the company\u2019s valuation.The latest round brings the company\u2019s total funding to $107 million.Meal-kit company Blue Apron Inc. has filed to go public amid questions about its long term profitability. And prepared meal delivery services like Sprig Inc. and Maple Food Co. have shut down. Also, grocery delivery startup Instacart Inc. faces big questions after Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s recently announced plans to acquire Whole Foods Market Inc.Freshly sends ready-to-eat meals weekly to subscribers in refrigerated packaging via             Federal Express                   from its facility in Phoenix as a way to keep costs down. It aims to differentiate itself from competitors with meals that are delivered pre-made and fresh--not frozen--in recyclable packaging.Getting a strategic investor like             Nestl\u00e9                   was \u201cnot about raising capital but about raising at the right time with the right opportunity,\u201d said Freshly\u2019s chief executive and co-founder Michael Wystrach.Nestl\u00e9 views Freshly as \u201ca great investment,\u201d said Jeff Hamilton, president of Nestl\u00e9 foods division.Mr. Hamilton added that the two companies have much to learn from each other: Freshly can learn more about how to scale a business and manufacturing, while Nestl\u00e9 can discover more about running a healthy meal delivery service.The financial services firm Raymond James estimated that prepared food delivery companies are targeting the takeout market yielding $245 billion from independent restaurants and chains.The firm\u2019s recent survey showed that only 5% of respondents use an online meal delivery service today, with 33% indicating that they are likely to use one in the future, giving opportunity for companies like Freshly.The brand is currently available for delivery in 28 states, including Texas, Arizona and California. The new funding round will help with the plans to expand the service nationwide in the coming months, Mr. Wystrach said.To expand to the East Coast and beyond, the company plans to open a kitchen and distribution facility in Savage, Maryland in 2018, he said.With nearly 400 employees in New York and Phoenix, Freshly plans to also hire more staff and open a new office in Phoenix.\u201cMore companies in the food tech arena are not going to succeed this year,\u201d Mr. Wystrach said commenting on the state of food tech. He views this as a natural selection process in an industry that has attracted strong attention from investors.\u201cFood is fundamentally changing,\u201d he said, \u201cand not everybody is going to figure it out.\u201dWrite to Olga Razumovskaya at olga.razumovskaya@wsj.com.

Mr. Altman left the board more than a year ago, he said.Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.The company, which once had over 300 employees, has done multiple rounds of layoffs since 2016 but now has 229 full-time employees, according to the company.\u201cRestructuring the company was a difficult decision, however making these changes enables us to run a healthy and profitable business moving forward,\u201d said Chris Lamontagne, a vice president at Teespring.Teespring didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about its recapitalization.\ufeff      The company ran into troubles when the field became more competitive and its Facebook advertising strategy was blunted.Under the recapitalization, Teespring is raising $5 million, part of which has closed, in new funding, according to a person familiar with the matter. The new investors would get paid back before any other investors in the event of a company sale or IPO.As a result, investors\u2019 stakes from previous rounds get reduced to just a fraction of what they owned before. In such cases, the employee option pool is often a casualty of common shares getting squeezed in an extreme recapitalization.A recapitalization is a measure that Silicon Valley startups avoid at all costs, as they are loath to drastically cut the value of their company and the value of their venture investors\u2019 stock. But in a struggling startup, a recap can be the only option to raise new capital and continue operating.Teespring\u2019s financing underscores how Silicon Valley startups can raise capital at aggressively high valuations, and then only later find their company\u2019s stock worth pennies on the dollar.As an indication of how much existing investors were affected, each Series A Teespring share was converted into about 3% of new shares in the deal. Each Series B share was converted into about 16% of new shares in the deal.Investors were paying $1 per share in the new round. When the company raised money in 2014, investors paid $43.98 per share, according to PitchBook.People using Teespring\u2019s site can sell custom designs, which the company manufactures and ships, giving sellers a cut of the profits. It gained notoriety in 2013 when it emerged from startup accelerator Y Combinator and its marketplace business was growing rapidly.Until late 2015 Teespring displayed figures like its daily gross sales, often around $75,000 to $100,000, onto screens in its Providence, R.I., headquarters, said a person familiar with the matter. The company removed these screens around December 2015, the person said.Much of Teespring\u2019s sales came through targeted advertising on Facebook. After Facebook changed the rules on how it could target users, sales suffered, according to this person.Its business became more competitive when Amazon\u2019s Merch launched in September 2015, joining a crowded field of competitors such as CustomInk, Zazzle and TeeTurtle.\u201cWe had challenges with some channels, like with the Facebook channel,\u201d said       Mr. Lamontagne.       \u201cAcross the board, sellers have found it much more difficult to target groups.\u201dTeespring has paid out $300 million to sellers over the course of the company\u2019s life, but declined to provide more specific sales or revenue figures, Mr. Lamontagne said.The company, originally founded in Providence, closed its Providence office in a round of layoffs last year.

Chief Executive John Mackey said         Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s       pursuit of the health food chain began with \u201ca blind date\u201d more than six weeks ago, a whirlwind courtship that culminated in Amazon\u2019s largest acquisition by far.In a town hall meeting at Whole Foods\u2019 Austin, Texas, headquarters on Friday, the day the deal was announced, Mr. Mackey and other executives applauded the \u201chistorical moment\u201d for Whole Foods, saying that the two companies hit it off right away, according to a security filing transcript.\u201cWe just fell in love,\u201d Mr. Mackey said, according to the transcript. \u201cIt was truly love at first sight,\u201dNew details emerged Monday regarding the timeline of events leading up to the $13.7 billion deal, showing that it was a somewhat spontaneous decision. The deal came together so rapidly\u2014the companies signed a confidentiality agreement April 27\u2014that Amazon\u2019s strategy for the acquisition is still largely in the air, according to people familiar with the matter.Even so, Mr. Mackey said at the town hall that, as part of Amazon, other store formats might emerge under a different name that don\u2019t necessarily meet the brand\u2019s high standards for natural and organic foods.The acquisition is \u201cgonna change our culture. I mean, it\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s inevitable. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d he said.Amazon has shed little light on its plans for the chain of stores since it announced the deal. \u201cWe admire the quality standards of Whole Foods. And I think it would be crazy to change them,\u201d said       Jeff Wilke,        chief executive of world-wide consumer at Amazon, at the Whole Foods town hall.An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on the town hall. Whole Foods also declined to comment.Mr. Mackey told his employees Friday that a year and a half ago he had a vision about the deal. \u201cI dreamed that we merged with Amazon,\u201d he said. \u201cI woke up. I told my wife about it. And she said, \u2019That\u2019s crazy.\u2019\u201dIn reality, Amazon informally looked at acquiring Whole Foods last year, according to people familiar with the matter. At the time, Amazon wasn\u2019t certain Whole Foods had enough stores to move groceries on the scale the e-commerce giant wanted.Albertsons Companies Inc., the nation\u2019s No. 2 grocery-chain behind         Kroger Co.      , began talking to Whole Foods earlier this year, after activist investor Jana Partners LLC began a campaign in February urging Whole Foods to sell. Mr. Mackey, though, wasn\u2019t interested in selling. Albertsons declined to comment.About a month and a half ago, a consultant connected Amazon Chief Executive       Jeff Bezos       and Mr. Mackey, after the two companies had started talking about a potential deal, according to people familiar with the matter.The deal came together after Mr. Mackey flew to Seattle with a group of Whole Foods executives. \u201cWe talked for 2\u00bd hours. I think we could have talked for 10 hours,\u201d Mr. Mackey said at the town hall.Mr. Mackey appeared to jab at the investor pressure Whole Foods has been facing from activist investors including Jana.Amazon has \u201chad the courage...to resist the drumbeat of short-term, quarterly earnings that have had us trapped here for a couple of years, as our same-store sales came down,\u201d he said.Mr. Mackey likened Friday\u2019s deal announcement to an engagement, and \u201clike an old traditional marriage, where there are all kinds of rules and chaperones, we can\u2019t consummate the marriage, until we\u2019re actually officially hooked up.\u201d\u201cThis is not a Tinder relationship,\u201d he clarified. \u201cI got a feeling I\u2019m off script.

They view the prison as a historic landmark that could draw visitors, particularly from New York City, who would then eat, shop and explore other attractions in Westchester County.Capitalizing on broad interest in incarceration and so-called dark tourism\u2014or visits to historic sites of death and punishment\u2014Sing Sing Prison Museum would tell the story of Sing Sing\u2019s past and its present, and host criminal-justice events, officials say.Local officials believe it would be one of the few prison museums in the U.S. on the grounds of an active prison. Most prison museums operate in decommissioned facilities.\u201cIt\u2019s an untold story in a facility with amazing name recognition,\u201d said       Jerry Faiella,        executive director of Historic Hudson River Towns, a regional-tourism nonprofit leading the project.Brent Glass,        director emeritus of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History, said Sing Sing\u2019s history illustrates that of criminal justice in the U.S. \u201cEvery chapter in the history of criminal justice in America has a few pages written at Sing Sing prison,\u201d said Mr. Glass, an adviser to the project.The idea of a museum at Sing Sing has been floated intermittently since the 1980s and ultimately came to a halt during the financial crisis of 2008. But local officials say this time, the former pipe dream has made meaningful steps toward reality.Late last year, the projected $50 million project won a $500,000 state economic-development grant. Last month, it selected board officers and the state approved the museum\u2019s charter, a step toward becoming a nonprofit.Studies by consulting firms estimate the museum would draw just over 100,000 visitors each year and increase tourism spending by $12 million statewide.Under the current plan, the museum would consist of two prison buildings. One, the so-called 1936 Powerhouse, is a former coal-powered plant now used as a maintenance garage for prison vehicles. The facility would hold exhibits and artifacts, including one of the series of electric chairs, nicknamed \u201cOld Sparky,\u201d which were used to execute 614 inmates.The other, the 1825 Cellblock, is the oldest building in the complex. Built by prisoners, the 1,200-cell limestone structure housed cells just larger than a yoga mat, with no running water and no toilets.In those years, the prison was ruled by fear and brutality, said Dana White, the Ossining Village Historian. \u201cIn the first few decades, they were whipped, wore striped suits, had to not speak and were also punished with the cat o\u2019 nine tails,\u201d she said of the inmates.In the 1980s, a fire destroyed much of the building\u2019s interior. Last week, ravens soared around the nearly 500-foot-long crumbling limestone walls. A raccoon carcass hung in barbed wire.The two buildings would be connected by a walkway. In the Powerhouse, windows overlooking prison areas would be opaque to prevent visitors from gawking at inmates, officials said.State prison officials have embraced the plan, which would include security features designed to keep prisoners and museum visitors separated.Michael Capra,        the prison\u2019s superintendent, noted that Sing Sing had \u201ca lot of notoriety for a number of different things.\u201dFor the state, the museum offers a chance to showcase the prison\u2019s rehabilitative side, including college classes and arts programs, and make an argument for an evolving view of punishment.\u201cThe museum is an avenue in which we can show the public that prison isn\u2019t a       Jimmy Cagney       movie,\u201d Mr. Capra said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a barbaric place where we put people in holes in the ground.\u201dMajor hurdles remain, however, including raising nearly $50 million, Mr. Faiella said. But he hopes the initial phase, which includes $3.8 million toward preservation and creating an event space in the Powerhouse, would open within the next two years, and the entire project would be completed by 2025, the 200th anniversary of the cellblock.\u201cIn museum time,\u201d Mr. Glass said, \u201cthat\u2019s very soon.\u201dAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Prison Capitalizes on Past.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 20:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sing-sing-prison-museum-seeks-to-capitalize-on-notorious-past-1497917651", "news_title": "Sing Sing Prison Museum Seeks to Capitalize on Notorious Past", "keywords": "new york prisons,prison museums,sing sing prison,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,law enforcement,prisons,prisoners,theaters,entertainment venues,museums,historical sites,gardens,leisure,hospitality"}, {"content": "Technology stocks in the S&P 500 posted their biggest gain of the year Monday, leading the broader index to a fresh high.The gains followed a three-session slump for the sector, which is up 19% this year and the best-performing group in the index.Apple                   was the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday, after falling in six of the past seven sessions.

The push for a quick vote before the weeklong July 4 recess could backfire, however, as some conservative and centrist Republicans have expressed concern about the emerging shape of the legislation.\u201cI expect us to vote on it next week,\u201d Sen.       Richard Burr       (R., N.C.) said Monday evening of the health bill. \u201cI believe the majority leader when he says he\u2019s going to take it up.\u201dCapital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.Mr. McConnell could pull back if he calculates that a little extra time could get him the votes needed to cross the finish line. He can lose no more than two GOP votes for a bill to pass. All Democrats are expected to oppose it.Still, Mr. McConnell has reasons to try for a quick health-care vote. The pressure could force lawmakers to reach a consensus on sticking points that have divided them. And GOP leaders in both chambers want to move on to other legislative items.Failure to take a vote before either the July 4 recess or the longer break later in the summer also could open Republican lawmakers up to pressure from constituents either concerned about losing their health coverage or expecting Republicans to follow through on pledges to repeal the law known as Obamacare. Some town-hall meetings during the spring, when the House was considering its legislation, saw lawmakers greeted by boisterous crowds.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the House bill passed in May would leave 23 million fewer Americans with health coverage in 2026 versus current law.GOP aides and others familiar with the negotiations said they anticipate the Senate bill\u2019s text will be released later this week. The CBO is expected to release its estimate of the Senate bill\u2019s impact on the federal budget and insurance coverage early next week, and a vote could potentially be held next Thursday, before lawmakers scatter.Democrats and consumer groups have criticized Senate Republicans for crafting the bill in closed-door sessions without any hearings or other input. As a form of protest, Senate Democrats are planning procedural maneuvers to try to delay legislation or nominees.Democrats are planning to \u201cembarrass the heck out of Republicans, who are as much in the dark as we are about their own leadership\u2019s plans on the bill,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.). \u201cOur tools are limited, but we\u2019re going to use every one of them.\u201dFor their part, many Senate Republicans have said they have yet to see their bill and want to make sure they are given enough time to review it.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a bill yet\u2014nobody has seen any language,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said Monday. Sen. Dan Sullivan (R., Alaska) said he wanted \u201csignificant time\u201d to review the bill\u2014\u201ccertainly days\u201d rather than hours, he said.Mr. McConnell has said all 52 Senate Republicans have been involved in the negotiations on issues the party has been talking about since the ACA passed in 2010.Meanwhile, provisions in the GOP bill that had proved vexing , including the fate of Medicaid expansion and tax credits to consumers, appear close to being resolved, people familiar with the negotiations said.Under an option being strongly considered, the bill would exact steeper financial cuts to Medicaid than under the House-passed legislation, the people said, a move likely to draw criticism from a number of Republican governors who want to preserve Medicaid open-entitlement funding and the ACA\u2019s expansion of the program.The entire funding system for the state-federal program for low-income and disabled people would be changed to a per capita cap, which would limit federal spending to states. That is the approach that also passed in the House bill, which would cut federal spending on Medicaid by $834 billion over 10 years.Under one proposal, the Senate bill would lower Medicaid\u2019s spending growth to a rate set in the House bill until 2025, when it would then be more sharply curtailed, according to people familiar with the discussions. The bill would slow the growth of federal spending on Medicaid by tying its growth rate to a lower price index, a change sought by Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.).That is likely to draw opposition from Republicans in states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, including Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Dean Heller of Nevada and       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia.\u201cRob does not support a growth rate that is lower than the House bill,\u201d Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Portman, said Monday.The bill is expected to start phasing down enhanced federal funding to the 31 states that expanded Medicaid, people familiar with the deliberations said. States could get a lower amount of federal funding for new enrollees in 2020, and the amount would fully phase down by 2023.The bill would also provide assistance to people who don\u2019t get health insurance on the job. But unlike the House version that set up tax credits based largely on income, the Senate version could provide subsidies that are larger for people who are low-income or in areas with high health-costs, a person familiar with the proposal said.Those tax credits are likely to be structured in ways similar to the ACA subsidies as a way to preserve restrictions on abortion funding, according to Senate GOP aides. Provisions restricting the use of the House bill\u2019s tax credits to pay for abortion hit procedural hurdles in the Senate.The ACA subsidies, which are advance tax credits paid to insurance companies to lower the cost of health-insurance premiums, currently can\u2019t be used to cover the cost of abortions.A senior White House official said they expected to have a stronger sense of how the votes were lining up by the end of the week and that they were confident the tally was heading in the right direction.The White House is set to continue emphasizing insurance-market woes this week as a reason to get health legislation done fast, an argument that President       Donald Trump       has made for weeks and that is taking on additional force as state insurance deadlines pass and insurers\u2019 rates and withdrawals from the marketplace become public. Democrats argue that Republicans are hurting the marketplaces by threatening to halt payments that are used to reduce out-of-pocket costs for lower-income patients and by raising questions about enforcement of the ACA\u2019s coverage mandate.Wednesday is a federal filing deadline for insurance companies to decide whether they will participate in the ACA\u2019s exchanges and the rates they want to charge.\u2014Louise Radnofsky and Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Senate Planning Health Vote.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 19:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-gop-plans-health-care-vote-next-week-1497905453", "news_title": "Senate GOP Plans Health-Care Vote Next Week", "keywords": "political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services"}, {"content": "Investors want       Michael Corbat       to change the narrative at             Citigroup Inc.        C -0.28%Since taking the bank\u2019s helm in October 2012,\u00a0Mr. Corbat\u2019s Citigroup\u00a0has played defense.\u00a0It\u00a0has scaled back businesses, shrunk the firm\u2019s global retail-banking footprint and wound down crisis-era assets that dragged on returns.For shareholders, it has been a slog. Citigroup\u2019s total return has underperformed those of its biggest rivals, save for             Wells Fargo                   & Co., since Mr. Corbat arrived on the scene. The bank has yet to show it can consistently generate returns that exceed its cost of capital; in the first quarter the bank\u2019s return on common equity was a tepid 7.4%. And the stock trades at just 85% of book value, the lowest valuation of the big\u00a0U.S.\u00a0banks.Now, investors, analysts and even top executives within the bank say it is time for Mr. Corbat, a former Harvard football star, to shift to offense. That means boosting growth and profitability in areas such as credit cards,\u00a0Wall Street stock trading and retail banking.\u201cWhat investors want now is to understand what\u2019s next in the story,\u201d said       Conor Muldoon,        fundamental portfolio manager at Causeway Capital Management LLC. \u201cWhat can you do to make the valuation better over time?\u201dCitigroup\u00a0is\u00a0among the largest holdings\u00a0in the firm\u2019s Global Value fund.The first test comes this week and next with the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual bank stress tests. A key indicator will be the bank\u2019s so-called payout ratio under the tests, a measure of whether it is given a green light to return more capital to shareholders than it is expected to earn in coming quarters.Citigroup shareholders want to see the payout ratio top 100%, meaning the bank would begin drawing down its capital pile rather than continue adding to it. If it can\u2019t do this, gains in its business won\u2019t accrue to shareholders.Assuming that won\u2019t be the case, investors want\u00a0Mr. Corbat to boost returns over the long term by generating more profit on lagging businesses, notably the bank\u2019s consumer-lending and retail-banking arm.In anticipation of this, Mr. Corbat has been honing the bank\u2019s focus, a notable change for a firm that was once a sprawling global behemoth.\u00a0He and his veteran management team have done things like exit nearly two dozen retail markets globally and slash the number of corporate clients to 14,000 from 30,000.The idea is to emphasize areas with the strongest growth prospects, particularly ones in which Citigroup has a dominant share with multinational consumers and corporations. In this vein, the bank has already said it would invest a further $1 billion to upgrade its Mexican retail bank.The biggest\u00a0recent\u00a0bet, though, is on credit cards, particularly for U.S. shoppers. Over the past two years, Citigroup has taken on more than $10 billion in card loans for             Costco Wholesale Corp.      , and made other investments, such as in Citigroup\u2019s proprietary reward-card offerings.As a result, Citigroup has the biggest global card lending portfolio of any U.S. bank. Card lending now makes up 24% of Citigroup\u2019s total loans, nearly double that of rivals such as             Bank of America Corp.       and             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co., according to analysts at Sanford Bernstein.Underscoring the importance of cards and the Costco business, which the bank\u00a0took over from\u00a0            American Express Corp.      , Mr. Corbat personally made surprise trips in December to call centers in Florence, Ky., Jacksonville, Fla., and Tucson, Ariz., according to people familiar with the trips.A key\u00a0point was to emphasize how critical customer service will be to get\u00a0new Costco-card\u00a0customers, who in many cases were offered\u00a0introductory rates that would expire, to become loyal users of their\u00a0cards.Those rates and other investment in cards were a drag on the bank\u2019s retail performance of late. While corporate and investment banking was at or near return targets last year, consumer banking generated a roughly 13% return against a 20% target, Mr. Corbat said recently.Citigroup is counting on the profitability of the card business to pick up meaningfully in the second half of this year as the initial investment period winds down.Mr. Corbat\u00a0and other executives are\u00a0expected to provide greater detail for these plans when the bank in July holds an investor day\u2014its first in nearly a decade. At this, he also will have to fight the view among some investors and analysts that Citigroup lacks a unifying strategy.The bank\u2019s consumer and corporate businesses\u00a0are like\u00a0\u201ctwo boats\u00a0floating in the ocean, not tied to each other,\u201d said KBW analyst       Brian Kleinhanzl.       In the past, he has called for the bank\u2019s breakup, though Mr. Kleinhanzl says he is now waiting to see how Citigroup fares amid rising interest rates.The investor day will give Mr. Corbat \u201cthe chance to lay out the new strategy,\u201d he added.Write to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Citigroup Looks to Go on Offense.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 19:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-test-for-citigroups-corbat-show-investors-the-money-1497891178", "news_title": "Citigroup\u2019s Plan to Revive Its Lagging Stock", "keywords": "ceo,chief executive,commercial-banking,credit cards,investor day,investors,retail-banking,stock trading,Citigroup,C,Wells Fargo &,WFC,Michael Corbat,Brian Kleinhanzl,Conor Muldoon,corporate,industrial news,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Supreme Court on Monday dealt a blow to consumer plaintiffs by limiting where lawsuits against companies with business in multiple states can be heard.By an 8-1 vote, the court said California courts could hear only claims by Californians against             Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.      , whose blood thinner Plavix allegedly created a substantial risk of heart attack, stroke and other injuries.The ruling was one of a series this term limiting so-called forum shopping, where plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys file suit in a state or federal court they believe will be sympathetic to their claims.An attorney for the plaintiffs declined to comment.\u201cWe are hopeful that this decision will provide litigants more certainty regarding where lawsuits can be heard,\u201d Bristol said in a statement. \u201cAt its core, this decision was about basic principles of federalism and fairness in our legal system.\u201dThe Plavix suit involved nearly 700 plaintiffs, including 86 Californians, alleging product liability and other claims under California state law. There was no dispute over the Californians\u2019 ability to sue in their own state courts, but Bristol, which is incorporated in Delaware and conducted its Plavix business from New York and New Jersey, argued the nonresidents were a different story.The California Supreme Court allowed the suit to proceed in state court, observing the plaintiffs had similar claims, that the drug was marketed nationwide and that Bristol had sold more than 180 million Plavix pills in the state, generating more than $900 million in sales.Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the high court, said that wasn\u2019t enough.Companies have long complained that plaintiffs in certain cases seek out venues where they believe they are most likely to receive favorable rulings, even when the cases involved may have only a tenuous connection to the area.Monday\u2019s ruling could provide a boost to companies by limiting the opportunities for such forum-shopping, as the tactic is known. It could limit plaintiffs\u2019 ability to stray far from a jurisdiction where the company does business or where the plaintiffs have a relatively direct interaction with the company or its product.Consumers groups, however,have warned that cutting back too sharply on plaintiffs\u2019 ability to sue could give big companies more ways to avoid responsibility for harm they cause.At issue was the definition of jurisdiction, which refers to a court\u2019s legal authority over a claim or party. Courts have \u201cgeneral jurisdiction\u201d over certain parties, such as companies based in their state, which allows them to hear any claim. They also may have \u201cspecific jurisdiction\u201d to hear particular claims, such as those arising over an incident within their state.In 2014, the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of general jurisdiction against corporate defendants, but the California court found specific jurisdiction based on Bristol\u2019s unrelated operations in its state.Justice Alito called that \u201ca loose and spurious form of general jurisdiction\u201d that fell outside the high court\u2019s precedent.\u201cThe nonresidents were\u00a0not prescribed Plavix in California, did not purchase Plavix in\u00a0California, did not ingest Plavix in California, and were not injured by Plavix in California,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe mere\u00a0fact that other plaintiffs were prescribed, obtained, and ingested Plavix in California\u2014and allegedly sustained the same injuries as did the nonresidents\u2014does not allow the state to assert specific jurisdiction over\u00a0the nonresidents\u2019 claims.\u201dOnly Justice       Sonia Sotomayor       dissented.\u201cThere is\u00a0nothing unfair\u00a0about subjecting\u00a0a massive corporation to suit in a state for a nationwide course of conduct that injures both forum residents and nonresidents alike,\u201d she wrote.In May, the court ruled that Montana state courts couldn\u2019t hear employee-injury claims against the BNSF Railway unit of the Omaha, Neb.-based             Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,       because the plaintiffs were neither residents of the state nor injured there, and the company itself, with headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, was based out of state. The Montana Supreme Court had found jurisdiction because the railway runs through the state and employs thousands of people there.Also last month, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowed the number of places patent-infringement suits could be brought, holding unanimously that a corporation is deemed to reside only in the state in which it is incorporated.Appeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Drug Suits Suffer Setback.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 19:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-further-curbs-plaintiffs-venue-shopping-with-bristol-myers-ruling-1497913350", "news_title": "Supreme Court Further Curbs Plaintiffs\u2019 Venue Shopping With Bristol-Myers Ruling ", "keywords": " bristol-myers squibb,california lawsuit, heart and stroke risks, jurisdiction, plaintiffs, plavix, product-liability lawsuit,supreme court,Bristol-Myers Squibb,BMY,U.S. Supreme Court,Samuel Alito,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch,pharmaceuticals,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "A\u00a0ros\u00e9 is a\u00a0ros\u00e9 is a\u00a0ros\u00e9\u2014until it\u2019s frozen.Frozen ros\u00e9\u2014or fros\u00e9, as it is sometimes called\u2014is fast becoming the cocktail of choice in drinking spots throughout New York City, say bar and restaurant professionals.Demand is so strong, especially with the weather turning hot and muggy in recent weeks, that some establishments say they can barely keep pace.Take Beaubourg Brasserie, a restaurant in Le District, the French-themed food hall in lower Manhattan\u2019s Brookfield Place. It says it sells up to 500 servings a day of its \u201cFros\u00e9 All Day\u201d $15 cocktail, a slushy combination of ros\u00e9, peach liqueur and melon-flavored vodka, among other ingredients, that is prepared in a frozen-drink machine.\u201cWe have a lot of regulars get here early\u201d for it, said Beaubourg general manager       Derek O\u2019Connor.The reason for the rush? The restaurant sometimes runs out of the drink, which means fros\u00e9-seekers will have to patiently wait until a new batch is frozen to the proper consistency and ready to pour.Others establishments report a similar fros\u00e9 frenzy, with the boom starting to extend beyond the city.The Parlor, an Italian restaurant and pizzeria in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., says it sells about 100 servings a week of its recently introduced $10 Blushing Slush cocktail, a version of the drink that uses an Italian version of ros\u00e9\u2014or rosato, as it is called.The rush for frozen ros\u00e9 is simply an extension of the rush for ros\u00e9, say food and drink experts: In the U.S., sales for the pink wine have surged in recent years, rising by 55% to $217 million in the 52-week period ending in late May alone, according to market researcher Nielsen.By most industry accounts, fros\u00e9 first began popping up on New York City drink lists about a year ago. But this summer has brought a new level of interest, with many establishments adding their own creative touches to the drink.At Dante, a drinking spot in Manhattan\u2019s Greenwich Village, the cocktail is made using a sorbet, flavored with sparkling ros\u00e9 and the bitter Italian spirit Aperol, as its base. Then, sparkling ros\u00e9 is poured atop, creating the right slushy texture.\u201cPeople are loving it,\u201d said Dante beverage director Linden Pride of the $13 cocktail, which is dubbed the Sgroppino Spritz.Drinking spots also are having fun with how they serve their fros\u00e9. At the Vine, a restaurant in Chelsea\u2019s Kimpton Hotel Eventi in Manhattan, the $16 Fros\u00e9 cocktail is offered in a stylish stainless-steel cup.But the choice of glass isn\u2019t just about the looks, says the restaurant.

Chris Christie announced that thousands of commuters on NJ Transit\u2019s Morris and Essex Lines Midtown Direct trains, who will be diverted to Hoboken through\u00a0Sept. 1, will be offered monthly tickets discounted by up to 63%.The MTA initially dismissed offering discounted tickets. On June 12, Ms. Hakim said that the MTA was focused instead on \u201cproviding service.\u201dUp to 20% of the LIRR rush-hour trains into and out of Penn Station will be canceled or diverted during the disruption, affecting an estimated 9,600 commuters.In the mornings, many trains will be diverted to stations in Brooklyn and Queens where passengers will be provided a free transfer to the subway. The MTA hasn\u2019t offered free subway transfers to LIRR passengers during the commute home.The LIRR will also add 36 cars to trains at Penn Station to increase capacity. And it will offer bus services from eight park-and-ride locations and two ferry services to 34th Street.Mr. Cuomo, who controls the MTA, said diverted riders \u201cdeserve a discounted fare for enduring the inconvenience of a disrupted commute.\u201dIn a statement issued\u00a0Monday\u00a0afternoon, Ms. Hakim agreed. \u201cWe intend to follow the governor\u2019s lead and make sure our riders are fairly compensated,\u201d Ms. Hakim said.Such a discount would have to be approved by the MTA\u2019s board, which meets\u00a0on Wednesday.Mitchell Pally,        chairman of the MTA\u2019s Long Island Rail Road committee, said\u00a0on Monday\u00a0afternoon that he strongly supports a discount.

That means Wisconsin officials for now won\u2019t have to put a remedial redistricting map in place.The stay suggests the court is proceeding with some trepidation as it wades into a highly political issue that has bedeviled justices in the past. The court\u2019s four liberal justices would have denied the stay and left in place the lower court\u2019s order requiring a new map by Nov. 1.Political gerrymanders are as old as the republic, though they have become more sophisticated as the technological possibilities of mapping have expanded with time. Both Republicans and Democrats have been accused of engaging in excessively partisan line-drawing in states where they hold power.Critics say the tactic creates too many uncontested districts, encourages overly partisan candidates and enables the party in power to skew voting results in its favor.Other cases are pending in court, including ones challenging Republican-backed lines drawn in North Carolina and map-making by Democrats in Maryland. Any rules announced by the high court would almost certainly affect districts drawn by state lawmakers both for Congress and for state legislatures.Justin Levitt,        a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said the timing of the case was particularly important with a new census on the horizon in 2020. States traditionally redraw their congressional and legislative districts after each decennial census.\u201cWe are on the brink of drawing new districts everywhere, for everything,\u201d Mr. Levitt said. \u201cA ruling here will undoubtedly change the landscape. It could give legislators more flexibility to draw lines, or less flexibility, or change how they use what flexibility they have.\u201dA minority of states use commissions to draw district lines, but the overwhelming majority leave the task to lawmakers, and if one party is in power, it has a good deal of control over the process. Courts can and have drawn voting lines in states where lawmakers deadlocked on how to do so.Because the GOP currently controls a majority of state legislatures, in the near term it potentially has more to lose if the court adopts new limits.The lower court in Wisconsin said lawmakers redrew the state\u2019s legislative districts after the 2010 census to unlawfully maximize the number of Republicans elected and dilute the power of Democratic voters. Election results since then have shown the redistricting had that effect, with the GOP winning a larger majority in the state Assembly, even as the statewide tally of votes was nearly even between Republicans and Democrats, the lower court said.Some Supreme Court justices have previously expressed concern about partisan gerrymandering, but a majority of the court has been hesitant to intervene so directly in the American political process and to say how much partisanship is too much. On the other hand, gerrymandering that discriminates against minority voters long has been held unconstitutional, and both the Supreme Court and lower courts frequently have invalidated such maps.Critics of gerrymandering, including retired Justice John Paul Stevens, say both racial and partisan gerrymandering often overlap, because party affiliation in the U.S. frequently correlates with race.The court took up a major case on partisan gerrymandering 13 years ago involving a challenge by Democratic voters to a Republican drawing of Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional districts. The ruling produced a 5-4 vote that threw out the lawsuit, but the court\u2019s reasoning was splintered and left the issue unsettled.Four conservative justices in that case said courts couldn\u2019t referee partisan gerrymandering claims because there was no workable standard for deciding when partisan line-drawing crossed a constitutional line, and because there wasn\u2019t a good way for a court to fix a violation if one did exist.The court\u2019s fifth conservative, Justice       Anthony Kennedy,        agreed that the specific Pennsylvania lawsuit should be thrown out, but he left open the possibility that the court in a future case could declare that the use of partisan favoritism in drawing districts was unconstitutional.Justice Kennedy\u2019s middle-ground position in the 2004 case makes him a focal point this time around. Moreover, one of the justices who allowed the Pennsylvania map, Antonin Scalia, has since died, and his successor, Justice Neil Gorsuch, hasn\u2019t weighed in on the topic.David Wasserman       of the Cook Political Report said he remained skeptical the high court would act to curb partisan gerrymandering, in large part because of the trouble with crafting legal rules that would work in the real world.\u201cHypothetical standards would run into geographic realities,\u201d Mr. Wasserman said, pointing to California as an example. The GOP wins a third of the vote in the state, but it\u2019s hard to point to heavily Republican areas of California, he said.In a 2-1 ruling in the Wisconsin case, a special three-judge court said state Republicans drew district lines \u201cto make it more difficult for Democrats, compared to Republicans, to translate their votes into seats.\u201d For example, Wisconsin Democrats in 2012 received 51.4% of the statewide vote, but only 39 of 99 state Assembly seats, according to the court opinion.The dissenting judge said Wisconsin\u2019s map complied with traditional redistricting principles, adding that Republicans likely would have won control of the state Legislature in 2012 and 2014 even without the alleged gerrymandering.State officials appealed the case to the Supreme Court, saying the lower court ruling was erroneous and unprecedented. The officials said recent election results were similar to those before the Republican-drawn map, citing among other things the advantages enjoyed by incumbents.They also argued recent results reflected the state\u2019s political geography, because Democrats are heavily concentrated in urban areas, making them less efficiently dispersed in districts statewide.Democratic challengers argued that the state\u2019s Republicans had an \u201cobsessive focus on partisan advantage\u201d when they drew the map. They said the GOP gave itself not only a large advantage but a durable one, with fewer overall seats subject to competitive contests.\u201cWisconsin\u2019s Assembly\u2026bears no resemblance to its evenly split electorate,\u201d they wrote in their initial papers submitted to the high court.The court will hear arguments in the case, Gill v. Whitford, during its new term, which begins in October.\u2014Jess Bravin contributed to this article.Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'High Court Weighs Gerrymanders.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 19:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-to-consider-limits-on-partisan-drawing-of-election-maps-1497881169", "news_title": "Supreme Court to Consider Limits on Partisan Drawing of Election Maps ", "keywords": " elections, electoral districts, gerrymandering, supco,supreme court,John Paul Stevens,Neil Gorsuch,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,elections,judicial branch"}, {"content": "A bipartisan conceit has been that the U.S. can defeat Islamic State by ducking the larger conflict in Syria, and now we\u2019re finding out that may not be possible. A U.S. F-18 jet shot down a Syrian bomber on Sunday to protect U.S. allies fighting Islamic State, and on Monday Russia and Iran threatened to target U.S. planes in response.A U.S. fighter shot down the Syrian SU-22 plane after Syrian aircraft made their second bombing run against Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) allied with the U.S. near Taqba. The regime was clearly testing whether the U.S. would assist its allies on the ground. The U.S. needed to send a deterrent message or Syrian President       Bashar Assad       will continue to press his offensive across SDF-held territory.The risk of escalation is real, but this isn\u2019t a skirmish the U.S. can easily avoid. Mr. Assad and his allies in Moscow and Tehran know that ISIS\u2019s days controlling Raqqa in Syria are numbered. They want to assert control over as much territory as possible in the interim, and that means crushing the SDF.The Russian threat on Monday to target with anti-aircraft missiles any U.S. aircraft flying west of the Euphrates River in Syria is part of the same intimidation strategy. Russia also suspended a hotline between the two armed forces designed to reduce the risk of a military mistake. Iran, which arms and assists Mr. Assad on the ground, vowed further Syrian regime attacks against SDF, all but daring U.S. planes to respond amid the Russian threat.The White House and Pentagon reacted with restraint on Monday, calling for a de-escalation and open lines of communication. But if Syria and its allies are determined to escalate, the U.S. will either have to back down or prepare a more concerted effort to protect its allies and now U.S. aircraft.This is the predicament President       Obama       put the U.S. in when his Syrian abdication created an opening for       Vladimir Putin       to intervene. Had the U.S. established a no-fly or other safe zone to protect refugees, the Kremlin might have been more cautious. Mr. Putin took the measure of Mr. Obama and gambled the former U.S. President would protest and do nothing. He was right. Now the Russian is testing President       Trump       as everyone maneuvers for post-ISIS advantage.As a candidate, Mr. Trump supported \u201csafe zones\u201d for refugees and opposition forces. But he\u2019s also shown no interest in a larger strategic goal than defeating ISIS. Now is the time for thinking through such a strategy because Syria, Russia and Iran know what they want.Mr. Assad wants to reassert control over all of Syria, not a country divided into Alawite, Sunni and Kurdish parts. Iran wants a Shiite arc of influence from Tehran to Beirut. Mr. Putin will settle for a Mediterranean port and a demonstration that Russia can be trusted to stand by its allies, while America is unreliable. None of this is in the U.S. national interest.The alternative would be to demonstrate that Mr. Assad, Iran and Russia will pay a higher price for their ambitions. This means refusing to back down from defending U.S. allies on the ground and responding if Russian aircraft or missiles attempt to take down U.S. planes. Our guess is that Russia doesn\u2019t want a military engagement with the U.S. any more than the U.S. wants one with Russia, but Russia will keep pressing for advantage unless President Trump shows more firmness than his predecessor.Appeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-19 19:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/skirmishing-over-syria-1497914427", "news_title": "Skirmishing Over Syria", "keywords": "Bashar Assad,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,risk news,terrorism,military action,editorials"}, {"content": "United Parcel Service Inc.       plans to charge retailers extra fees to deliver packages during the busiest weeks before Christmas, creating a new challenge for an industry already coping with a shift away from traditional stores.The surcharges, announced Monday, are a shot across the bow for retailers, including giants such as             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.        WMT -0.43%       and             Macy\u2019s Inc.,        M 1.37%       that have been ramping up their e-commerce businesses as they seek to offset declining foot traffic to shopping centers. It also adds to the costs of             Amazon.com Inc.        AMZN 0.24%       and other online players, which rely on UPS and rival             FedEx Corp.       to handle a surge in holiday shipments.The fees will force retailers to decide over the next few months whether to raise shipping prices\u2014something that is difficult to do when online shoppers are reluctant to pay shipping fees\u2014increase the prices of goods or eat the extra costs themselves. Some may seek to avoid the surcharges by spreading holiday deals to other weeks during the season.Patrick Gill, chief executive of the high-end fishing gear site TackleDirect.com, said news of the surcharge was frustrating since it is going to be applied when his site needs lower rates to compete against             Amazon.com, Wal-Mart Stores                   and others.\u201cThis will add up to be another unaccounted for expense during the holiday season,\u201d Mr. Gill said. \u201cIt will force us to push some product away from UPS in some cases.\u201dFor UPS, the move signifies a need to get paid for a service that has become an integral cog in the holiday shopping period, when it must add planes, trucks and thousands of staffers.While Amazon and countless other websites are the front door to millions of products on the web, UPS, FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service do the heavy lifting that eliminates trips to stores and delivers packages to homes.UPS said it had to impose the charge to offset the additional cost of delivering packages.The company is \u201ctrying to make sure they are, at the margin, getting compensated for stretching their network,\u201d said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst       David Vernon,        adding that the carriers have the power to raise prices given how critical they have become to the period. \u201cWithout them, Christmas kind of doesn\u2019t happen.\u201dSome analysts expect FedEx to follow in some way, as the two rivals often take pricing cues from each other. A FedEx spokesman declined to comment. The company reports its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday.The surcharges unveiled by UPS will hit its customers during the busiest shipping weeks and on the most popular products during that time. Between Nov. 19 and Dec. 2\u2014the weeks encapsulating Black Friday and Cyber Monday\u2014UPS is adding a 27-cent charge on all ground packages sent to homes.Ground orders typically arrive within five days and are a heavily used shipping option during that time since shoppers don\u2019t necessarily need the items quickly.Last year, UPS collected on average $7.97 in revenue per item shipped in its U.S. ground network.The peak surcharges won\u2019t be in effect for the following two weeks, when shoppers typically take a pause, but they will return for the final holiday rush. From Dec. 17 to Dec. 23, UPS will charge an extra 27 cents for each ground shipment, 81 cents for next-day air and 97 cents for two- or three-day delivery.In a twist, the UPS surcharge includes an element that gives stores an advantage.The charges apply only to residential deliveries, so retailers and shoppers may be able to avoid the charges by getting orders shipped to stores, an option retailers have been pushing for the past few years with varying success.UPS Chief Commercial Officer       Alan Gershenhorn       said the per-package cost will only \u201cmarginally increase\u201d during the holiday period. As an example, UPS said a five-pound next-day air package from Atlanta to Philadelphia will cost 1% more to ship. Another example offered by UPS showed a 2% increase with the added fee.UPS daily volume swells to more than 30 million in the weeks before Christmas versus more than 19 million on a normal day. Citi Research estimates the new surcharges will add $50 million in revenue and profit at UPS this year.The carrier declined to provide a projection on the revenue impact from the surcharges, but said it already was factored into its outlook. The company had more than $60 billion in revenue last year.Shippers may try to avoid the surcharge by offering more deals in October and early November, or by negotiating a discount. \u201cThe real objective for the surcharge is to motivate shippers to do their part in avoiding such volume increases,\u201d said       Satish Jindel,        president of ShipMatrix Inc., a software provider that analyzes shipping data.UPS, FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service are all looking to recoup massive investments they are making in their delivery infrastructure to accommodate the surge of packages flowing into their networks in recent years as more people shop online.UPS is spending $4 billion this year alone as it automates more package-sorting hubs and opens new warehouses.UPS is looking at other ways to recoup costs during peak periods, so it isn\u2019t left holding the bag for the additional investments. Last month, UPS CEO       David Abney       said the carrier is negotiating with retailers to help them pay for the any additional investments, even the capacity goes unused.On Monday, UPS said will also impose surcharges on all large packages above a certain threshold, which cost more to ship and sort, throughout the entire period. Those surcharges will be more onerous, tacking an additional $24 fee to an existing surcharge of $70 for a package weighing more than 150 pounds and over a certain size.UPS also will charge a peak surcharge of $249 per package on the largest packages, on top of a $150 fee for such \u201covermax\u201d packages. A UPS spokesman said that such items only represent a small sliver of packages, since most are shipped through its freight business.The company is encouraging shippers to instead send such packages through its freight network, where it recently imposed a second 4.9% increase in shipping rates the past year.Write to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'UPS to Add Surcharge to Cost of Holiday Shipments.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 19:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ups-to-add-delivery-surcharges-for-black-friday-christmas-orders-1497883509", "news_title": "UPS to Add Delivery Surcharges for Black Friday, Christmas Orders ", "keywords": "black friday,christmas,costs,holiday pricing,package delivery,surcharge,ups ,Amazon.com,AMZN,Macy's,M,United Parcel Service ,UPS,Wal-Mart Stores,WMT,United States Postal Service,FedEx,FDX,United Parcel Service Cl B,Satish Jindel,Alan Gershenhorn,David Abney,David Vernon,plans,strategy,marketing,markets,pricing,sales promotions,corporate,industrial news,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,department stores,shopping malls,superstores,couriers,messengers,freight transport,logistics,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,transportation"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Saying the federal government is lagging behind the \u201ctechnology revolution,\u201d President       Donald Trump       called for more than $1 trillion in savings during the next 10 years by overhauling outdated computer systems and improving information technology.\u201cOur goal is to lead a sweeping transformation of the federal government\u2019s technology that will deliver dramatically better services for citizens, stronger protection from cyberattacks,\u201d Mr. Trump said\u00a0Monday\u00a0at the White House during a meeting with more than a dozen executives from some of the nation\u2019s top technology companies.\u201cThat\u2019s a big problem, no question about it,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be working on it, and we\u2019re going to solve the problem.\u201dMr. Trump didn\u2019t lay out specific plans to reach those savings, instead pointing to a recent announcement that the Veterans Affairs Department would be updating its electronic health records.

For instance,             Centene Corp.       has said it is planning to grow its exchange offerings, including in Ohio, Washington and Missouri, though it said it isn\u2019t yet clear which precise counties it will cover.Earlier,\u00a0another region at risk of having no exchange plans next year, around Knoxville, Tenn., was able to avoid a coverage gap when\u00a0BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, after talks with the state\u2019s insurance regulator,\u00a0agreed to re-enter the area for 2018.In Iowa, state officials are seeking federal approval for a plan that would make big changes to the state\u2019s individual insurance market in a bid to retain insurers. Monday, the state\u2019s insurance commissioner, Doug Ommen, said, \u201cWe appreciate and understand Medica\u2019s desire to provide coverage in all of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties. That is our goal as well.\u201d But he said that the large requested rate increase may risk driving younger, healthier consumers out of the market, and he will continue to press for the state\u2019s overhaul proposal.Geoff Bartsh, a vice president at Medica, said in a statement that \u201dthe individual market still needs reform. We will continue to work with federal and state officials to provide the certainty and stability needed for markets to succeed long-term.\u201dIowa\u2019s largest insurer, Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield, had said in early April that it would stop selling ACA plans in Iowa next year after losses, and it said Monday it didn\u2019t make a 2018 rate filing for ACA plans with Iowa regulators. But the company Monday reiterated that it will return to selling individual plans in all counties of Iowa if the state\u2019s proposal wins federal approval.In pulling out, and also in seeking significant rate increases in many places, insurers are citing a combination of business factors and uncertainty at the federal level as Republicans try to pass a major health overhaul through Congress.In particular, insurers have focused on the\u00a0future of federal cost-sharing payments that help reduce costs for low-income ACA enrollees, which the       Trump       administration has threatened to halt. Insurers have said that there will likely be further pullbacks and sharp rate increases if they aren\u2019t given certainty about the cost-sharing payments.However, when Premera earlier announced its limited pullback\u2014which still left it offering exchange plans in many parts of Washington state\u2014the insurer pointed to cost issues in its coverage area and said the move would \u201chelp us moderate rising costs for our members while allowing us to continue to offer coverage to more counties in the state than any other carrier.\u201d At the time, Premera said that uncertainty around the cost-sharing payments wasn\u2019t a factor in its decision.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Insurer Reverses Plan to Stop ACA Offerings in County.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 19:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurer-reverses-aca-exit-plan-in-one-of-two-washington-state-counties-1497908249", "news_title": "Insurer Reverses ACA Exit Plan in One of Two Washington State Counties  ", "keywords": " aca insurance exchanges, aca marketplaces, affordable care act, affordable care act exchanges, grays harbor county, health insurance exchanges, klickitat county, mike kreidler, premera blue cross,washington state, washington state insurance exchanges,Premera Blue Cross,Mike Kreidler,plans,strategy,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,health,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,health maintenance organizations,private health insurance"}, {"content": "France has for years been the sick democracy of Europe that can\u2019t reform itself. But suddenly the French have surprised the world, and maybe themselves, by handing new President       Emmanuel Macron       a legislative majority and a mandate to restore Gallic vitality.In Sunday\u2019s runoff election for the National Assembly, Mr. Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique en Marche party and its centrist ally Modem clinched 350 of 577 seats. A 60% majority in the Assembly looked impossible a few weeks ago, and the smart money thought Mr. Macron would be forced to cobble a legislative coalition with the center-right Republicans or the center-left Socialists.Instead voters handed the new President and his upstart party a decisive mandate to act alone. The Republicans and their center-right allies won 137 seats, down 88 from the previous Assembly. The previously ruling Socialists were humiliated with 45 seats, down 283. The party of       L\u00e9on Blum       and       Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand       is now a minor opposition group. The hard-right National Front secured eight seats, short of the 15 that would have allowed       Marine Le Pen       to shape some of the legislative agenda.Credit Mr. Macron for seizing the political moment and pursuing the unorthodox strategy of recruiting newcomers and political outsiders as En Marche candidates. They arrive unburdened by a voting history, which means they can be more flexible than traditional politicians. On the other hand, they presumably don\u2019t have firm convictions beyond loyalties to Mr. Macron\u2019s call to revive French confidence and economic growth.How will the 39-year-old use this malleable majority? European Union grandees are patting themselves on the back for checking the growth of insurgent political movements on the Continent. They see Mr. Macron as putting a fresh face on the familiar European \u201csocial model\u201d of burdensome regulation, high taxes and bureaucratic hauteur. German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       exemplified this attitude when she congratulated Mr. Macron for defeating \u201cpopulism.\u201dIf Mr. Macron takes that advice, he\u2019ll fail like the last three French Presidents did. At its best Mr. Macron marshaled his own version of populism and even nationalism. This wasn\u2019t cramped or ethnocentric nationalism \u00e0 la Ms. Le Pen. Instead it emphasized inclusive French pride. Married to a reform agenda, Mr. Macron\u2019s mode of populism could see France take its rightful place next to Germany and revive French influence in Europe.Mr. Macron says he wants to start by loosening the 35-hour workweek, which will be a crucial test of his political will, but there\u2019s much more to do. As Economy Minister in the Socialist government, Mr. Macron tried limited privatization, but now he can make the case that taxpayers shouldn\u2019t have to subsidize bloated state-run enterprises.His proposal to cut corporate taxes to 25% from 33% is welcome, but French workers should get a tax cut, too, and the wealth tax that has been the terror of entrepreneurs should be scrapped. As a candidate he shied away from pension reform, but it\u2019s hard to see how France can prosper long-term with a current retirement age of 60. Some want to diminish the reform mandate because voter turnout fell to 43%. But Mr. Macron\u2019s duty is to those who showed their reform hope by voting.Mr. Macron\u2019s big test will come when labor unions and the left hit the streets to paralyze the country as he moves his reform agenda in the assembly. Recent Presidents have wilted under that assault, and if Mr. Macron does the same he will fail too. Reform opportunities like Mr. Macron\u2019s come once in a generation.

Last July the Feds went after more than $1 billion in financial assets, real estate, artwork, film rights and a private jet. Now the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, as Justice calls it, is targeting $540 million in assets owned by relatives and associates of Prime Minister       Najib Razak.The most striking item on the list is a necklace worth $27.3 million featuring a 22-carat pink diamond. The lawsuit alleges that 1MDB funds were used to buy it and other jewelry for the wife of \u201cMalaysian Official No. 1.\u201d U.S. officials told the Journal that Official No. 1 is Mr. Najib.The 1MDB fund denies that money is missing, Mr. Najib denies any wrongdoing, and Attorney General       Mohamed Apandi Ali       cleared Mr. Najib in January 2016. Mr. Apandi Ali said in a statement Friday, \u201cWe also note that there has been no evidence from any investigation conducted by any law enforcement agencies in various jurisdictions that shows that money has been misappropriated from 1MDB.\u201dYet the U.S. Justice Department has provided considerable evidence that $3.5 billion went missing, while the Swiss Attorney General puts the figure at $4 billion. Singapore and Switzerland have already punished financial institutions for breaking money-laundering rules in moving 1MDB funds.Justice last week released new information allegedly showing that about $850 million that             Deutsche Bank                   loaned to 1MDB was diverted to accounts controlled by Mr. Najib and his associates. One lawsuit alleges that proceeds from a $3 billion 1MDB bond offering in 2013 were diverted to help purchase Coastal Energy, a Houston-based oil firm. The Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund International Petroleum Investment Co. says that 1MDB owes it about $6.5 billion for defaulted debt that IPIC guaranteed.The Malaysian government accuses the U.S. of pursuing a political vendetta. But       Barack Obama       pursued closer ties with Mr. Najib, even inviting him to play golf in Hawaii in December 2014, right up to when the Journal broke the 1MDB story in July 2015.Defense Minister       Hishammuddin Hussein,        who is Mr. Najib\u2019s cousin, on Sunday urged the U.S. to press criminal charges so the accused can clear their names. The Journal has reported that U.S. investigators are preparing to charge at least one of Mr. Najib\u2019s associates. Since Malaysian authorities have concluded that there\u2019s nothing worth investigating in the 1MDB matter, civil and criminal cases in other jurisdictions are the best hope Malaysians have of finding out whether their country has become a kleptocracy.", "news_time": "2017-06-19 19:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-malaysia-a-kleptocracy-1497914171", "news_title": "Is Malaysia a Kleptocracy?", "keywords": " 1mdb, corruption, embezzlement, kleptocracy,malaysia, najib razak,U.S. Justice Department,corporate crime,legal action,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,physical asset transactions,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,embezzlement,financial crime,fraud,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,editorials,financial investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "The Supreme Court has done some of its best work in recent years on the First Amendment, and that continued with an 8-0 decision Monday protecting unpopular speech. The Justices ruled that an Asian-American rock band called The Slants can\u2019t be denied a federal trademark because the government fears the name might offend someone.Simon Tam,        front man for The Slants, sought to register the name with the Patent and Trademark Office as a rebuke to those who use it as a pejorative. The government denied the trademark, citing a Lanham Act provision that bans trademarks that \u201cmay disparage . . . persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols.\u201d The Court ruled that this clause is unconstitutional (Matal v. Tam).The idea that the government has an interest in suppressing viewpoints that offend \u201cstrikes at the heart of the First Amendment,\u201d Justice       Samuel Alito       wrote. \u201cSpeech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express \u2018the thought that we hate.\u2019\u201dThe government claimed trademark registration is a form of government free speech, but that was also dismissed by Justice Alito. \u201cIf a trademark qualifies as government speech,\u201d he wrote, the government \u201cis babbling prodigiously and incoherently,\u201d endorsing competing products and making contradictory statements.The effort to \u201ccleanse\u201d commercial speech of any offense is also a nonstarter since there are many kinds of merchandise that \u201cdisparages prominent figures or groups and the line between commercial and non-commercial speech is not always clear.\u201d Think anti-Trump T-shirts.Justice       Anthony Kennedy       wrote a concurrence making a useful point about how government could abuse such leverage over speech. \u201cA law that can be directed against speech found offensive to some portion of the public can be turned against minority and dissenting views to the detriment of all,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote. \u201cThe First Amendment does not entrust that power to the government\u2019s benevolence.\u201dIn other good news, the Justices on Monday continued to police legal forum shopping. In Bristol-Myers Squibb                   v. Superior Court of California, the Justice ruled 8-1 that California courts don\u2019t have jurisdiction to decide injury claims for some 592 out-of-state plaintiffs when the defendant company isn\u2019t based there and the injuries didn\u2019t occur there.This is the third time this term the Justices have ruled against lawyers who file injury cases in so-called judicial hellholes known for jackpot verdicts regardless of an actual connection to the locale. Justice Alito\u2019s majority opinion called it a \u201cstraightforward application\u201d of \u201csettled principles of personal jurisdiction.\u201dThe sole dissenter was Justice       Sonia Sotomayor,        who frets that the decision will increase the burden on injured plaintiffs and prevent nationwide class actions, but suits with merit can always be filed in federal court.Appeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-19 19:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/victory-for-the-slants-1497914141", "news_title": "Victory for The Slants", "keywords": "corporate,industrial news,intellectual property rights,industrial property rights,trademarks,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch,editorials"}, {"content": "Three art dealers were indicted on accusations of selling fake       Damien Hirst       works, Manhattan prosecutors said Monday.The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said       Vincent Lopreto,        52 years old of New Orleans;       Marco Saverino,        34 of Cottonwood, Ariz.; and       Paul Motta,        50 of Sedona, Ariz., had stolen $400,000 from dozens of buyers by selling counterfeit art. They are accused of grand larceny, scheme to defraud and other crimes.In January 2014, Mr. Lopreto pleaded guilty to identity theft and scheme to defraud for selling forged art advertised as Damien Hirst prints, prosecutors said. Mr. Lopreto was in a New York state prison from May 2014 until October 2015, records show.\u201cVincent Lopreto is charged with resuming the same scheme to knock off Damien Hirst artworks that sent him to prison just 15 days after being released,\u201d Manhattan District Attorney       Cyrus Vance Jr.       said in a statement.A lawyer for Mr. Lopreto declined to comment. Lawyers for the other men couldn\u2019t be reached. Mr. Lopreto pleaded not guilty in state Supreme Court in Manhattan\u00a0on Monday. The other two men haven\u2019t yet appeared in court.Prosecutors said that from October 2015 through February 2017, Mr. Lopreto used a printer, stamp and other tools to make fake prints, then worked with Messrs. Saverino and Motta to advertise the art online. They also used fake purchase receipts and certificates of authenticity, according to prosecutors.The district attorney\u2019s office said the sales were made to people in the U.S., United Kingdom, Italy, South Africa and other countries. The defendants made four sales to Manhattan residents and two to an undercover investigator, they added.Among the counterfeit works is a 2012 print called \u201cEsculetin,\u201d prosecutors said. The counterfeit print, which consists of 20 colorful dots, is stamped with \u201cHirst\u201d on the back.Howard Rosenbaum,        co-owner of a Florida gallery that has an authentic \u201cEsculetin\u201d print, said his print, which is framed, is priced at $14,000. It is part of an edition of 55, he added.Mr. Hirst, a contemporary British artist, is perhaps best known for works such as a shark in a tank of formaldehyde.

On Monday, in a hot case that involved immigration, the Supreme Court protected the constitutional separation of powers and confirmed that courts are supposed to interpret laws, not make them.After the 9/11 attacks, hundreds of illegal aliens were detained and some were held for months without trial while law enforcement investigated their potential terror connections. The confinement conditions were harsh for some of these detainees, such as small cells and little exercise time, and they sued then Attorney General       John Ashcroft       and other high-ranking federal officials under a 1971 precedent known as Bivens.That opinion allows people who have suffered from unreasonable searches and seizures to sue prosecutors or police for money damages, but it belongs to another judicial era. The       Warren BurgerCo      urt \u201cinferred\u201d a private cause of action into an 1871 statute\u2014a style of jurisprudence that was already in retreat by the 1980s on both the legal left and right. The High Court has since been more cautious about recognizing such \u201cimplied\u201d rights, unless Congress explicitly creates them by passing statutes.In Ziglar v. Abbasi, the detainees asked to expand Bivens in order to challenge policy decisions that they claim resulted in violations of their Fifth Amendment due process rights. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals complied, but the Supreme Court was more modest about judicial power. In a 4-2 decision (with two recusals), the majority held that, absent legislative instruction, the prisoners lack the standing to sue.The question when applying the Bivens relic to new circumstances, wrote Justice       Anthony Kennedy,        \u201cis \u2018who should decide\u2019 whether to provide for a damages remedy, Congress or the courts? The answer will most often be Congress.\u201d The legislature accountable to voters is better positioned than judges to balance the equities and protect the public interest.This is especially true because the foreign nationals could still have challenged their detention and remedied any constitutional violations under habeas corpus. The real purpose of their suit wasn\u2019t financial compensation for injuries but to second-guess the executive branch\u2019s response to 9/11 and the national security choices made by Mr. Ashcroft and others acting in their official capacities amid an emergency.Justice       Stephen Breyer       read his overwrought dissent from the bench, invoking Japanese internment in World War II, the Alien and Sedition Acts and even Civil War prison camps. But our guess is that Ziglar would be unexceptional in more conventional political times.The       Trump       Presidency has inspired some judges to be more confrontational, even if they exceed their Article III powers to send a message to Article II. Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban is in our view legal and constitutional, if unwise, yet two appellate circuits have discovered pretexts to strike it down. The danger is growing of an ends-justify-the-means cascade with the Constitution as an afterthought.Justice Kennedy ends his opinion with a pledge of fidelity to \u201cthe idea of the rule of law that must inspire us even in times of crisis.\u201d Ziglar is a model for good judicial behavior when a real crisis inevitably arrives.Appeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-19 19:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-justices-act-like-grown-ups-1497913890", "news_title": "The Justices Act Like Grown-Ups", "keywords": "political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch,editorials"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The head of Ukraine\u2019s state energy company cheered the U.S. Senate\u2019s decision to take aim at a Russian gas pipeline to Germany in sanctions legislation last week and urged the Trump administration to penalize companies helping Russia execute the project.Andriy Kobolyev,        chief executive of Ukrainian state energy firm Naftogaz, said the Nord Stream 2 project\u2014which would double the existing capacity of a natural gas link that runs from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea\u2014goes against both U.S. and Ukrainian interests.\u201cWe would urge (the U.S.) to extend sanctions as soon as possible on all companies that would potentially be involved in that project,\u201d Mr. Kobolyev said in an interview in Washington. He said the pipeline, which would further allow Russia to bypass Ukraine when sending gas supplies to Europe, poses risks to Ukraine, rewards Russia and threatens European unity.The Nord Stream 2 pipeline project has highlighted an uncomfortable reality for a Europe that has been working to counter Russian activities in Ukraine but also relies in part on Russian energy imports. About a third of Europe\u2019s gas comes from Russian state energy giant Gazprom.A consortium of five European energy companies\u2014            Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC,             Engie SA,Uniper SE,OMV AG       and Wintershall Holding GmbH\u2014agreed in April to provide up to \u20ac4.75 billion in long-term financing for the Nord Stream 2 project, which is owned by Russian state PAO Gazprom and slated for completion in late 2019.The U.S. Senate took aim at the project last week in a new Russian sanctions bill that passed 98-2. The bill reiterated U.S. opposition to Nord Stream 2 and authorized the president to sanction companies investing in Russian energy export pipelines on a certain scale.The bill still must pass in the House of Representatives to become law. Because the pipeline stipulation isn\u2019t mandatory, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration also would need to authorize sanctions against companies involved in the pipeline project.The provision angered Germany and Austria. \u201cWe cannot accept a threat of extraterritorial sanctions, illegal under international law, against European companies that participate in developing European energy supplies,\u201d the German and Austrian foreign ministers said. \u201cEurope\u2019s energy supply is Europe\u2019s business, not that of the United States of America.\u201dBut other European Union countries, such as Poland, have opposed the Nord Stream 2 project, making the pipeline a divisive project within the European bloc.Ukraine also stands to lose from the pipeline. The country collects from 2% to 4% of its gross domestic product a year from energy transit fees, or $2 billion to $4 billion, Mr. Kobolyev says, which Nord Stream 2 would reduce. Most of the Russian gas that transits Ukraine goes to Italy, he said.The Naftogaz chief characterized the issue not only as a financial concern for Ukraine but also a national security matter. \u201cWe are convinced that one of the reasons the Russians have not launched a full-scale offensive against Ukraine, one of the reasons is the transit route,\u201d he said.Mr. Kobolyev said the project would increase Gazprom\u2019s ability to \u201cabuse its dominant position in the European gas market,\u201d divide Europe and cause risks and negative consequences that the European Union so far has failed to recognize.\u201cAny independent assessment shows that this pipeline is against U.S. interests. It is against the principle of solidarity in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no excuse not to use sanctions against it.\u201dMr. Kobolyev said he has been holding talks with U.S. officials about getting American liquefied natural gas shipments into Ukraine. So far, the most viable route is through the Bosporus Strait, but Turkey isn\u2019t allowing LNG tankers through the waterway, he said, expressing hope for a new U.S. diplomatic effort to solve the problem.\u201cAll market participants should be prepared for commercial competition based on a level playing-field, rather than lobbying for Nord Stream 2 to become subject to other rules than all comparable projects,\u201d Sebastian Sass, Nord Stream 2\u2019s representative to the EU, said in a statement. \u201cAt Nord Stream 2, we do actually rely on our commercial competitiveness, rather than calling for political intervention. Importantly, competitiveness also requires ongoing maintenance investments.\u201dMr. Sass said the pipeline would diversify Europe\u2019s gas supply by offering another piece of infrastructure for future gas demand of European customers. \u201cOur project is based on commercial competitiveness and full compliance with international laws,\u201d he said.\u2014Emre Peker in Brussels contributed to this article.Write to Paul Sonne at paul.sonne@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 19:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-state-energy-chief-praises-senate-measure-on-russian-pipeline-1497913659", "news_title": "Ukraine State Energy Chief Praises Senate Measure on Russian Pipeline ", "keywords": "energy,european union,natural gas,nord stream 2,pipeline,russia,ukraine,Nord Stream 2,U.S. Senate,Andriy Kobolyev,Sebastian Sass,Donald Trump,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,pipeline transportation,oil,natural gas midstream operations"}, {"content": "Canadian authorities have arrested six individuals indicted in the U.S. in 2015 in connection with Canada Drugs, a Winnipeg, Manitoba-based online pharmacy that allegedly sold illegal and counterfeit cancer medications in the U.S.The individuals were arrested on June 14 and 15 under extradition warrants stemming from an extradition request from the U.S., a spokesman for Canada\u2019s Department of Justice said. The individuals, arrested in Manitoba and British Columbia, have been released on bail and are scheduled to appear in Canadian court on July 12, the spokesman said.The Canadian court system must decide whether the individuals should be extradited. Those hearings haven\u2019t yet been scheduled, the spokesman said.The Canadian Justice Department said the individuals are \u201cwanted for prosecution by the United States for offences relating to the illegal importation and sale of prescription and clinical drugs in the U.S.\u201dA spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Montana, which filed the 2015 indictment, declined to comment.The six arrested include Kristjan Thorkelson, founder of Canada Drugs, and       Thomas Haughton,        who was president of two Canada Drugs subsidiaries, according to the indictment.

The business is illegal in the U.S. because the drugs weren\u2019t made for U.S. sale at facilities inspected by the Food and Drug Administration, according to the indictment.Weaknesses in Canada Drugs\u2019 supply chain led the company to ship counterfeit copies of the cancer drug Avastin to U.S. doctors in 2011, according to the indictment. The company\u2019s ties to the counterfeit drug shipments were reported in 2012 by The Wall Street Journal.The discovery of the counterfeit cancer drugs caused alarm among patients and doctors when the FDA first issued warnings about them in 2012 and led to a crackdown on the trade that resulted in the imprisonment of several doctors who bought foreign-made drugs. The drugs\u2014typically infusions or injections administered at a doctor\u2019s office\u2014were attractive to doctors because they were often cheaper than the equivalent U.S. brands.An earlier charge in the indictment accusing an Illinois man, Ram Kamath, of aiding Canada Drugs was dismissed by the federal court in Montana in 2015 after Mr. Kamath entered a deferred prosecution agreement with prosecutors, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney in Montana said.Write to Jeanne Whalen at jeanne.whalen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 19:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/six-people-connected-to-online-pharmacy-arrested-in-canada-1497913583", "news_title": "Six People Connected to Online Pharmacy Arrested in Canada", "keywords": "arrests,bail,canada drugs,canadadrugs.com,charges,doj,extradition,fda,hearing,kris thorkelson,money laundering,online pharmacy,Canada Drugs,Canada's Department of Justice,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,legal action,drug trafficking,dealing,politics,international relations,domestic politics,trafficking,smuggling,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing"}, {"content": "Over the past eight years, high-stakes negotiations in Congress over the federal debt limit have repeatedly brought Washington to the verge of default. We were on opposite sides of these debates, as senior policy advisers to President       Obama       and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, and we continue to disagree about taxes and the proper size of government. Yet we both believe that the statutory debt limit has outlived its usefulness as a mechanism for restraining the size of the national debt. Or, put more precisely, we think that whatever residual value the debt limit may have is far outweighed by the risk that a potential U.S. default poses to the global economic order.Now the debate is heating up again: The Treasury Department is already taking \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to avoid going above the debt ceiling, but that can last only a matter of months. Congress will have to act. But this time instead of merely raising the debt limit, lawmakers should abolish it altogether\u2014for the good of President       Trump,        all his successors and the American people.The Constitution assigns Congress the power to tax and spend, which determines the annual budget deficit and, therefore, the debt. Separately, the Constitution authorizes Congress to \u201cborrow Money on the credit of the United States.\u201d But what if lawmakers approve spending, and then later refuse to borrow the money needed to satisfy the obligation? The result would be a default: Washington either would stop paying bondholders or would fall short on its other commitments\u2014for example, to disabled veterans or defense contractors or even taxpayers who are owed refunds.Fortunately, this has never happened. Congress has always met its responsibility to authorize the borrowing needed to pay America\u2019s bills. Over the past several decades, however, lawmakers have made an increasingly regular practice of using the debt limit as leverage, flirting with default as a way to get concessions from the other side.Until World War I, Congress authorized debt on a case-by-case basis, approving individual bond issues or allowing borrowing for a specific purpose. In 1917, in an effort to make the process more efficient, Congress granted the Treasury the authority to borrow up to a certain limit.For decades, this system worked effectively. But skirmishes over the debt limit began as early as 1953, when President Eisenhower asked lawmakers to raise the figure. Sen.       Harry F. Byrd Sr.      , a Democrat from Virginia, led the upper chamber\u2019s Finance Committee to reject the president\u2019s request. Then in 1967 the House, controlled by Democrats, rejected in a floor vote a debt-ceiling increase requested by President Lyndon Johnson.The challenge of raising the debt limit became even more difficult over the following decades. In 1985 Treasury Secretary       James Baker       became the first to use \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to prevent borrowing from hitting the cap. An expanding set of such measures were deployed in 1995-96, 2002, 2003, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2017. Now that these measures are used almost annually, it is hard to justify calling them \u201cextraordinary.\u201dAlthough the measures mostly involve inconsequential reshuffling in the federal ledger, they can have real-world costs. For example, Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin,        like several of his predecessors, has suspended the sale of state and local government series bonds. This allows the Treasury to stay below the debt ceiling for longer but can make it more costly for states and cities to manage their finances.As the debt limit nears, costs mount. In the past, the Treasury has operated with a smaller cash cushion against unforeseen contingencies, has rejiggered bond maturities in ways that interfere with liquidity in the financial system, and has paid higher yields to borrowers worried about timely repayment. At the same time, brinkmanship over the debt limit erodes consumer and business confidence and increases market volatility.Note that these costs are incurred simply by approaching the debt limit without actually reaching it. In a 1985 letter, President Reagan discussed what would happen if the government did someday teeter over the edge: \u201cThe full consequences of a default\u2014or even the serious prospect of default\u2014by the United States are impossible to predict and awesome to contemplate.\u201d During the debt negotiations of 2011, President Obama similarly warned that hitting the limit \u201cwould risk sparking a deep economic crisis\u2014this one caused almost entirely by Washington.\u201dWhile many countries have limits on the policies that drive debts and deficits, none of them have a history of using the threat of default as a negotiating tool once spending and taxing decisions have been made. Denmark is the only other country with a debt limit on the books, but it is set so high as to be irrelevant.To meet the obligations set out by Congress, the U.S. will have to raise the debt limit by about $3 trillion over the next four years\u2014and another projected $1 trillion, give or take, each year thereafter. At this pace, the risk is high that negotiations to raise the debt ceiling may fail, with unimaginably severe consequences.Lawmakers are right to be concerned about steep increases in the debt. But those worries should be expressed when the policies that actually increase the debt are voted on. Once new policies become law, defaulting on interest payments or veterans\u2019 benefits is hardly productive. A new mechanism is necessary to tackle the debt issue\u2014and it must be one that does not prejudge the question of revenue increases versus spending cuts, which is for future Congresses to resolve.For now, the right move is to eliminate the debt limit permanently. That would let the Treasury focus on the most efficient and effective ways to manage the federal government\u2019s cash flow, giving future presidents, both Democratic and Republican, a freer hand. No matter which party holds the White House, all Americans would benefit from taking the threat of a U.S. default off the table.Mr. Furman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, was chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, 2013-17.

The average Major League Baseball player earns an annual salary of more than $4 million (plus $100 a day in meal money)\u2014far more than it takes to lead a comfortable, well-appointed life. Let\u2019s say the team owners cut those salaries by half, to $2 million or so. Putting aside the union protections that the players enjoy, surely they would continue showing up to work. Almost certainly fans would continue to enjoy the same quality of play on the field.Now consider the parallel to top-selling pharmaceuticals. The high price tags on popular drugs allow pharmaceutical companies to earn revenue far in excess of the cost of developing those drugs. Even if prices were cut drastically, these drugs would continue to sell. The question, both in the ballpark and the drug lab, is what happens next season, and the season after that.For every successful Major Leaguer, there are hundreds of disappointed players whose careers end before they ever reach the big leagues. The promise of a big-league payoff must remain strong enough to continue to attract players to a career path with a high rate of failure. For the players of tomorrow, a drastic cut in the potential rewards of playing would encourage them to consider other sports, or even other careers. The 2014 Super Bowl-winning Seattle Seahawks quarterback,       Russell Wilson,        chose to enter the 2012 National Football League draft over spring training with the Colorado Rockies.In the same way, the return on capital invested in successful drugs must be enough to compensate for all the lost bets on failed drugs. The typical investor\u2014even a professional\u2014places both winning and losing bets; as in baseball, no one goes undefeated. Thus, the winning bets must produce enough \u201cexcess\u201d wealth to offset the losses from betting on the losers.In baseball, the issue of player salaries faded long ago. The talent pool is deep, stadiums are full, beer and hot dog sales are brisk, and lucrative TV contracts keep owners flush. Equilibrium has been achieved. In drug pricing, the debate remains at full throttle. The big question: How much do we need to pay today to attract the investment that will keep drug discovery alive tomorrow?Economists have tried to answer from a variety of angles. In all cases, price reductions are associated with less innovation, although the magnitude varies. A 1% reduction in price reduces innovation\u2014meaning the number of new drugs launched\u2014by as little as 0.25% or as much as 4%. A 2015 study published in the RAND Journal of Economics found that it takes about $2.5 billion of additional expected pharmaceutical revenue to generate one additional new drug launch.This research demonstrates that prices matter, but it doesn\u2019t answer the big question: What is the \u201cright\u201d price to guarantee innovation? Innovators should be able to share in the value they create for society, but how much?Economists       Anupam Jena       and       Tomas Philipson       have found that the manufacturers of new medical technologies have historically captured about 15% of the surplus they generated for society. Drugs and devices allowing companies to exceed this threshold tend to face the greatest pushback. For example, the biopharmaceutical company             Gilead Sciences                   earns 20% to 40% of the total social value created by sales of Sovaldi, which is used to treat late-stage hepatitis-C patients. Insurers, politicians and advocates raised a ruckus in 2013 at Sovaldi\u2019s hefty $1,000 per pill price tag.The pharmaceutical industry might find itself on safer ground politically if it remained closer to historical norms for the harvesting of social value. Such self-restraint may already be too late, given calls from President       Trump       and Sen.       Bernie Sanders       for a crackdown on drug prices. The levers they could reach for\u2014increased importation, regulation of advertising and competition, even price controls\u2014have broad popular support.Economists agree that higher drug prices spur more drug discovery, but they still don\u2019t know how much discovery is enough or how high prices need to be. What is clear, however, is that if pharmaceutical prices only covered R&D costs\u2014with no surplus left over\u2014then no one would want to play ball.Mr. Goldman is director of the Leonard D.

The Supreme Court, however, has been reluctant to extend the Bivens doctrine to additional abuses by officials. The majority concluded that permitting the suit against senior officials would entail extending the Bivens doctrine.In dissent, Justice       Stephen Breyer       said the allegations fell well within the scope authorized by the Bivens doctrine.\u201cHistory tells us of far too many instances where the executive or legislative branch took actions during time of war that, on later examination, turned out unnecessarily and unreasonably to have deprived\u00a0American citizens of basic constitutional rights,\u201d Justice Breyer wrote, joined by Justice       Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Justice Breyer read his dissent from the bench, a signal at the Supreme Court of deep distress among the minority over a case\u2019s disposition. It was the first time any justice had taken the step during the current term.The 4-2 decision, which potentially gives Trump administration officials a freer hand when responding to emergencies, was rendered by a short-handed court.       Justices Sonia Sotomayor       and       Elena Kagan       were recused because of contact with the case before joining the high court, while President Donald Trump\u2019s appointee, Justice       Neil Gorsuch,        hadn\u2019t been seated when the case was argued in January.The court, however, didn\u2019t extinguish claims against the jail\u2019s warden, Dennis Hasty, who was accused of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d toward the inmates\u2019 mistreatment.

The measure will sunset on\u00a0July 1\u00a0unless lawmakers act. The city would return to a system of one central board, plus local school boards, that many say was inefficient and overtly political.\u201cThere was corruption, it was rampant, it was obvious. There was patronage everywhere, unqualified people got hired all the time, and nothing could stop it,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at City Hall\u00a0on Monday at a rally urging lawmakers to renew the measure.\u00a0Letting it lapse would \u201cset us back years.\u201dSenate Republicans have said they aren\u2019t opposed to mayoral control, but some have questioned Mr. de Blasio\u2019s stewardship of city schools and sought more financial information before renewing the measure. Mr. de Blasio has cited improved graduation rates and test scores, and said he provided them with all the information they have requested. Former Mayor       Michael Bloomberg       was granted mayoral control for a seven-year stretch, and then again for six years.While asking for the law\u2019s extension has become an annual\u00a0ritual\u00a0for Mr. de Blasio, the effort has taken on greater urgency this year, with Albany lawmakers deadlocked just three days before the end of the legislative session\u00a0on Wednesday.New York City Comptroller       Scott Stringer,        a Democrat, said at\u00a0Monday\u2019s\u00a0rally that Senate Majority Leader\u00a0      John Flanagan,        a Republican, \u201cand his crew want to get their grubby hands on our kids.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Flanagan responded,\u00a0\u201cIf Mayor de Blasio\u2019s cronies want to engage in cheap political attacks and call it leadership, that\u2019s their prerogative.\u201dAlbany lawmakers in recent years have used the measure to eke concessions out of Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who is unpopular among many state lawmakers. The mayor helped lead an unsuccessful push to flip the Senate to Democratic control in 2014.In exchange for approving mayoral control, Senate Republicans have sought\u00a0concessions from Mr. de Blasio on charter schools, for example.\u00a0He has said charter school expansion should be considered separately from mayoral control.Some people familiar with the matter said Assembly Speaker       Carl Heastie,        a Democrat, feels he has had to give up too much in recent years to secure mayoral control, and has put less effort into the push this year.Mr. Heastie told reporters\u00a0Monday\u00a0he plans to leave Albany\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0when the session is over and he isn\u2019t coming back to handle any outstanding issues. The Legislature already passed more aid to charters in the state budget earlier this year and didn\u2019t need to do more for them, he said. \u201cThe issue is not about the merits of charter schools.\u201dEducators, and current and former city officials from the administrations of both Messrs. de Blasio and Bloomberg say the measure was critical in helping them improve the city\u2019s schools.The issue has \u201ccome to symbolize the dysfunction that can gridlock Albany,\u201d       Howard Wolfson,        a former deputy mayor under Mr. Bloomberg, said in a phone interview. \u201cYou basically have something that all sides agree on which is mayoral control. And yet there is an inability to get this done.\u201dMr. Wolfson said failing to renew the measure would be a \u201cterrible, terrible error.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that Bill de Blasio has done with the schools that I disagree with,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I feel very strongly that he should have the ability to run them, and voters should be able to hold him accountable.\u201dUnder the current system, which began in 2002, the mayor picks the schools chancellor and most members of the so-called Panel for Educational Policy.If mayoral control isn\u2019t extended, the city will revert to its previous system of a seven-member central board of education. Each borough president would pick one member, and the mayor would pick two. This board would choose a chancellor, and each of the 32 community districts would hold an election to fill its own board.While backers of that system said it gave more authority to local parents, critics said it was rife with patronage and dysfunction.Harold Levy,        the last city schools chancellor under the old system, called it a \u201cnightmare.\u201d Reverting to it would mean local board elections controlled by \u201ccronies and local despots and people who can get their minions out to the polling place,\u201d he said.The last-minute scramble has stoked frustrations among the city\u2019s business and good government groups who say mayoral control has worked, and shouldn\u2019t be subject to the horse-trading of state and city politics.\u201cAll the evidence shows that mayoral control has proven to be a superior governance system,\u201d said       Kathryn Wylde,        president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group. \u201cFor it to fall apart for partisan, political reasons makes no sense.\u201d\u2014Mike Vilensky contributed to this article.Write to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.com and Leslie Brody at leslie.brody@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 18:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/politics-at-play-in-mayors-bid-to-keep-control-of-new-york-city-schools-1497912765", "news_title": "Politics at Play in Mayor\u2019s Bid to Keep Control of New York City Schools ", "keywords": "albany lawmakers,bill de blasio,carl heastie,charter schools,education,john flanagan,mayoral control,new york city,new york city schools,new york state legislature,politics,scott stringer,political,general news,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,school,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house"}, {"content": "Solitude has been instrumental to the effectiveness of leaders throughout history, but now they (along with everyone else) are losing it with hardly any awareness of the fact. Before the Information Age\u2014which one could also call the Input Age\u2014leaders naturally found solitude anytime they were physically alone, or walking from one place to another, or standing in line.Like a great wave that saturates everything in its path, hand-held devices deliver immeasurable quantities of information and entertainment that now have virtually all of us instead staring down at our phones. Society did not make a considered choice to surrender the bulk of its time for reflection in favor of time spent reading tweets or texts.Yet with an awareness of what we have lost, each of us can choose to reclaim it. And leaders in particular\u2014whose actions by definition affect not only themselves\u2014have more than a choice. They have an obligation. A leader has a responsibility to seek out periods of solitude.The assumption, unless the leader says otherwise, is that he is constantly accessible\u2014if not in person, then electronically. But the task of changing that assumption requires only an act of will. A leader can designate a certain number of workdays each month as no-meeting days, as Endgame CEO       Nate Fick       does. A leader can mark off 60 or 90 minutes each day for time to think. A leader can make it known that he does not text, and checks his email only intermittently or at certain points in the day. (One has to wonder what leaders who make a point of responding to emails within minutes are otherwise doing with their time.) A leader can declare weekends off-limits for work emails, as       Wendy Kopp       did at Teach for America.There is a price to be paid for changes like these. Emails will go unanswered for hours rather than minutes, subordinates might have to wait 60 minutes to speak to the boss, and meetings might get pushed back a day.So be it. Scheduling a leader\u2019s time is a zero-sum game, and fundamentally a manager must decide whether reflection and hard analytical work are important enough to warrant perhaps a third of his time.There is another price for changes like these, namely the usual social levy upon nonconformity. Left unexplained, these changes will lead others to say the leader is arrogant, aloof, unapproachable. But there is no reason to leave the reasons for solitude unexplained. The leader can simply make clear, in as much or as little detail as he sees fit, that doing the organization\u2019s work requires time to think.And he can bear out that explanation during the times when he is accessible\u2014by providing subordinates with clear comments on their work rather than vague ones, thoughtful answers rather than platitudes, and otherwise performing like a leader who has thought through his guiding principles rather than made them up on the fly.Judge Kethledge sits on the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Not anymore. In the past three weeks, the Saudis have launched a coordinated diplomatic offensive against neighboring Qatar, hinted at new ties with Israel, scolded Pakistan, turned up the heat in their confrontation with Iran, and carried on a war of words with Turkey. Meanwhile, they continue to bomb Yemen to support their local allies in that country\u2019s increasingly bitter civil war.The Saudis are also bringing new gusto to domestic policy: The 2030 plan backed by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is the most far-reaching and ambitious program for Saudi reform and restructuring ever seriously proposed. Privatizing the state oil giant Aramco (or at least part of it) and using the money to diversify the economy is, by Saudi standards, a revolutionary idea.The jury is out on whether the Saudis\u2019 new foreign and domestic policies will work, but no doubt something fundamental has changed in what used to be one of the world\u2019s most cautious and slow-moving countries. The question is why. Some look to the deputy crown prince, a 31-year-old reformer elevated to his current role in 2015. But his rise is more a sign of the times than the main force driving change. After all, in the old Saudi Arabia, a mere 30-something never would have been allowed anywhere near the reins of power.So what is behind the new Saudi activism? Fear. It\u2019s an emotion that comes naturally to an oil-rich kingdom with a relatively small population in a neighborhood full of predatory rivals. For years fear made the Saudis cautious, since they felt they could take shelter behind a strong and confident America. Now they aren\u2019t so sure.In Riyadh, the Age of Insecurity began during President       Obama\u2019s       tenure. Mr. Obama\u2019s outreach to Iran\u2014and his willingness to overlook its unprecedented regional aggression in his quest for a nuclear deal\u2014left the Saudis feeling isolated and betrayed. As Iranian power spread across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, Saudis concluded that the U.S. no longer saw Saudi security as part of its core national interest.The       Trump       administration has sought to reassure the Saudis that the \u201ctilt to Iran\u201d has ended, but their insecurity runs deep. From Riyadh, and from many other world capitals, the erratic shifts in American foreign policy\u2014from Bush to Obama to Trump\u2014raise disturbing questions about the future. Who comes after Mr. Trump?       Elizabeth Warren      ?       Sean Hannity      ? As American politics becomes less predictable and more extreme, countries that have grounded their national strategy on the stability of an American alliance must reassess their options.Then there is oil, an issue on which Saudis and Americans once saw eye to eye. With their enormous reserves, the Saudis believed that they were in the oil business for the long term. Unlike more aggressive players, who wanted to push oil prices as high as possible, the Saudis used their position as a \u201cswing producer\u201d to keep markets reasonably stable\u2014something the U.S. appreciated. The Saudi goal was to keep their customers committed to oil long term and forestall heavy investment in alternative fuels.The shale revolution is shifting this balance. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia are no longer allies in the oil market. American frackers, who can quickly increase or decrease output as prices change, are challenging Saudi Arabia\u2019s role as the global swing producer.Worse, from a Saudi point of view, the long-term dynamics of the oil market seem to be changing. There is much less talk of \u201cpeak oil\u201d in the sense of peak production, and more talk of \u201cpeak demand.\u201d Advances in energy efficiency and alternative power-generation are shifting the long-term demand curve for hydrocarbons. At the same time, Saudi Arabia\u2019s rapidly growing population will place increasing demands on its economy. Riyadh worries that if oil becomes less profitable, it will be unable to keep its people happy.All this suggests that the current turbulence in the Gulf is here to stay. If the Trump administration wants to restore tranquillity, it should think holistically about Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic and security problems\u2014and creatively about how this American alliance, a pillar of Middle East stability since World War II, can be renewed.Mr. Mead is a fellow at the Hudson Institute, a professor of foreign affairs at Bard College, and editor at large of the American Interest.Appeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-19 18:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fear-is-what-changed-saudi-arabia-1497912337", "news_title": "Fear Is What Changed Saudi Arabia", "keywords": "aramco, iran,mohammed bin salman, obama,riyadh,saudi arabia, trump,political,general news,national,public security,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,military action,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Get ready for an outbreak of headlines tomorrow about how       Donald Trump       portends the crackup of the Republican Party. Many of the stories have already been written. They await only a successful effort by Democrat       Jon Ossoff       to take the seat for Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District that Republicans have held since       Newt Gingrich       won it back in 1978.In a special election that has spawned a thousand lessons for our politics, the most obvious goes unmentioned: You can make any House seat competitive if you\u2019re willing to make the race for it the most expensive in American history. Yet somehow the scolds who are always moaning about the corrosive effect of money in politics have gone silent about the $23 million Mr. Ossoff raised\u2014most of it from donors outside the state.Certainly a Democratic capture of a seat held by a Republican,       Tom Price,        who now serves in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, would lift Democratic spirits. Still, the race has been overhyped. While it does offer lessons for both Republicans and Democrats, in general these are not the ones getting all the ink.Start with the Republicans. Back in April,       Karen Handel       beat 10 other Republican candidates (all but one of them men) in the initial April 18 election. Mrs. Handel is a fairly standard-issue Southern conservative well known in the district from her prior runs, including unsuccessful recent bids in GOP senate and gubernatorial primaries.Against Mr. Ossoff her greatest liability has less to do with her than with President Trump. Special elections frequently become referendums on the incumbent party. That\u2019s exactly what Mrs. Handel is now facing from a Democratic rival who got his initial boost from an online campaign based on the pitch \u201cMake Trump Furious.\u201dMrs. Handel has tried to steer a middle course on Mr. Trump. Unlike some of her GOP rivals, who fully embraced him in the April contest (and lost handily), she\u2019s been more measured. Although Mr. Trump held a fundraiser for her and recently tweeted his support for her campaign, she tries to avoid mentioning his name on the stump. During a debate with her opponent earlier this month, she insisted she isn\u2019t \u201can extension of the White House.\u201dWith all this Mrs. Handel\u2019s biggest disadvantage isn\u2019t Mr. Trump but the lack of GOP legislative accomplishments in Washington. The result is that she hasn\u2019t been able to point to legislation as a way of contrasting her agenda with her opponent\u2019s. That leaves her tied to President Trump the Personality rather than President Trump the Leader pushing through a GOP agenda making life better for the American people.Mr. Trump inadvertently alluded to this dynamic in his own tweet on Monday supporting Mrs. Handel: \u201cThe Dems want to stop tax cuts, good health care and Border Security. Their ObamaCare is dead with 100% increases in P\u2019s. Vote now for Karen H.\u201d In fairness, Mr. Trump has been in office only five months, so it\u2019s early days. But if Republicans do not make good on promises like the ones Mr. Trump put in his tweet, in 2018 they will find themselves in a fix worse than Mrs. Handel\u2019s.But Democrats have their issues too. For one thing, Mr. Ossoff doesn\u2019t even live in the Sixth District. For another, the redness of this district is more complicated than has been presented. In November,       Hillary Clinton       came within 1.5 percentage points of Mr. Trump. Mr. Ossoff himself came within 1.9 points of winning 50% of the vote in April, which would have spared him a runoff.The 30-year-old Mr. Ossoff has been changing his tune as well. Making life hell for Mr. Trump may be an excellent slogan for riling up the Democratic base and attracting notice from the national press. But in affluent Republican suburbs where the Democrat will need some GOP votes to push him over the top, the full Bernie probably won\u2019t do it.So more recently Mr. Ossoff has been playing down the anti-Trump resistance in favor of a more centrist campaign that emphasizes bipartisanship and fiscal restraint. His advantage here is that he\u2019s never held office, so he doesn\u2019t have a record that can be used against him. Meanwhile, the Handel camp is running ads claiming that however moderate Mr. Ossoff may sound in Atlanta, once in Washington he\u2019d be a       Nancy Pelosi       Democrat.Plainly the voters are impassioned. Early voting has set a record. In an election hinging on turnout, and at a time when anti-Trump sentiment is at fever pitch, this would appear to be an advantage for Mr. Ossoff.If he pulls it out on Tuesday, Mr. Ossoff\u2019s victory will no doubt be celebrated from coast to coast as the first clear sign that Republicans are in real danger of losing their House majority in 2018.But if Mr. Ossoff\u2014with all his millions, with all his volunteers, with all the free media\u2014still manages to lose, will all those telling us the race is a harbinger of things to come ask what that means for the Democratic Party?Write to mcgurn@wsj.com.Appeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-19 18:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-march-on-georgia-1497912225", "news_title": "Democrats March on Georgia", "keywords": "congress,ga-6,georgia,handel,ossoff,trump,white house,Jon Ossoff,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "The presidential election of 1960, coming on the heels of eight years of Republican power under America\u2019s great war hero,       Dwight D. Eisenhower,        carried for Democrats a hope of return to the 20-year period of party hegemony they had enjoyed under       Franklin Roosevelt       and       Harry Truman.       But it also posed the possibility that Eisenhower had reshaped American politics, bringing the Republicans to parity with their opponents. The sense that the United States was entering a new political era was heightened by the relative youth of the two candidates.       John Kennedy       was 43;       Richard Nixon,        47. In \u201cThe Road to Camelot,\u201d       Thomas Oliphant       and       Curtis Wilkie,        both veteran political journalists, retell the story of this momentous campaign, reminding us of now-forgotten details of Kennedy\u2019s path to the White House. The authors are clearly admirers of Kennedy\u2019s but not hagiographers.The contrasts between the candidates are by now legendary. Born to a lower-middle-class family, Nixon had worked his way through college and served in the Navy during World War II. Elected to the House in 1946, he had pursued the issue of communist infiltration in the government, won election to the Senate in 1950 and, two years later, become Eisenhower\u2019s vice president. A natural successor despite Ike\u2019s seeming lack of enthusiasm, Nixon turned back a challenge from New York Gov.       Nelson Rockefeller,        who was strong in the Northeast but too liberal for the GOP heartland.Kennedy, by contrast, was the son of a self-made multi-millionaire and had been educated at an expensive prep school and Harvard. Like Nixon, he enlisted when war came, commanding a PT boat that was wrecked in a collision with a Japanese war ship. His older brother, Joe Jr., a Navy pilot, was killed, leaving Jack as the bearer of the family standard. Like Nixon again, he was elected to the House in 1946. A successful Senate race followed in 1952.Kennedy\u2019s debut in presidential politics came at the 1956 Democratic convention, just after he had received national attention for \u201cProfiles in Courage,\u201d a Pulitzer Prize-winning book that saluted figures who had taken principled but unpopular stands. When the nominee,       Adlai Stevenson,        threw the vice-presidential selection open, Kennedy was barely edged out by Tennessee Sen.       Estes Kefauver,        famous for leading an investigation of organized crime. The loss, such as it was, ensured that Kennedy would receive none of the blame for Stevenson\u2019s second trouncing by Eisenhower.By Thomas Oliphant and Curtis Wilkie  Simon & Schuster, 433 pages, $28By 1960 the race for the Democratic nomination was a confusing melee, with Kennedy as one of several candidates, among them, Missouri Sen.       Stuart Symington,        Minnesota Sen.       Hubert Humphrey       and Senate Democratic leader       Lyndon Johnson.       Stevenson stood aloof, hoping for a deadlock.Kennedy\u2019s money, strong showings in state primaries and organization all prevailed, giving him the delegates for a first-ballot victory at the convention. For vice president, Kennedy passed over the early favorite, Symington, and reluctantly offered the job to Johnson, who could be more helpful to him in the South and West and exercise more influence in Congress if the ticket won.In the rural areas of the South and West, anti-Catholicism remained alive and well and constituted a problem for Kennedy\u2019s campaign. Some important Protestant churchmen\u2014including       Billy Graham       and       Norman Vincent Peale      \u2014charged that Kennedy would be obliged to follow the orders of the pope in matters of public policy. In large electoral-vote urban states, however, anti-Catholicism could generate a backlash in Kennedy\u2019s favor.Kennedy attacked the problem head-on in a speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association, where he stated that if, as president, he found himself forced to choose between violating his conscience and violating the national interest, he \u201cwould resign the office.\u201d Messrs. Oliphant and Wilkie note that, in the question-and-answer session after the speech, the ministers\u2019 \u201cconvoluted questions . . . served as foils for Kennedy\u2019s concise answers\u201d and ended up providing great \u201ctheater.\u201d When asked lengthily whether he would seek approval from the Vatican, Kennedy replied simply: \u201cI don\u2019t have to have approval.\u201d The answer, the authors say, \u201celicited applause.\u201dThe campaign began a new tradition\u2014the televised presidential debate. One especially portentous exchange involved policy toward Cuba and the emerging Castro dictatorship. Here Kennedy seemed more militant than Nixon\u2014though Nixon knew that the Eisenhower administration was training Cuban exiles for a probable invasion. By holding his own with Nixon, Kennedy came out ahead.A final dramatic event marked the campaign\u2014the arrest of       Martin Luther King Jr.       in Georgia and his imprisonment in the state penitentiary. Kennedy\u2019s intervention to secure the civil-rights leader\u2019s release cemented a strong black preference for him in the election. In the end, Kennedy\u2019s narrow victory depended on razor-thin margins in key states\u2014notably in Illinois, where the Chicago machine produced a dubious margin of victory. Some recriminations were inevitable, but the result was irreversible.\u201cThe Road to Camelot\u201d succeeds nicely in recounting a political campaign yet does not quite capture the appeal of its major character. Kennedy made several campaign appearances in New York. As a Columbia University graduate student, I went down to lower Manhattan to see him speak on the steps of City Hall. Many local dignitaries\u2014among them, Mayor       Robert Wagner       and former Gov.       Averell Harriman      \u2014arrived to polite applause. After a brief wait, an open car came down the street with the candidate and his beautiful wife. As it passed, the crowd surged powerfully. Kennedy\u2019s words that day were not particularly memorable, but his tone of determination and the urgency of his manner were stirring. He was, at his best, charisma in action.Mr. Hamby is the author, most recently, of \u201cMan of Destiny:       FDR       and the Making of the American Century.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-19 18:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-kennedys-charisma-won-the-white-house-1497912111", "news_title": "How Kennedy\u2019s Charisma Won the White House", "keywords": "book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,elections,reviews"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Supreme Court on Monday said Alabama violated a murder defendant\u2019s rights, finding that the state failed to provide him with a psychiatric expert who could contribute adequately to his defense.The 5-4 decision, dividing largely along ideological lines, stopped short of declaring that defendants have a constitutional right to place such experts on their legal teams, the issue the court initially agreed to decide, leaving dissenters fuming that the majority flouted court rules to reach its consensus.James E. McWilliams       was convicted of having raped, robbed and murdered Patricia Vallery Reynolds, a Tuscaloosa, Ala., convenience store clerk, in 1986. On appeal, he contended Alabama violated his rights by rejecting his attorney\u2019s pleas for a psychiatric expert to evaluate his medical record and potentially challenge the pretriafinding by a state \u201clunacy commission\u201d that he suffered from no mental illness.The justices ordered an appeals court to review whether the failure to provide the expert assistance was so substantial an error as to void the death sentence.At issue in the decision was the meaning of a 1985 precedent, Ake v. Oklahoma, where the court said an indigent defendant must \u201chave access to the psychiatric examination and assistance necessary to prepare an effective defense based on his mental condition when his sanity\u201d at the time of the crime in question.Some legal authorities have said the decision was unclear in whether it required that trial courts place a psychiatrist on the defense team, or simply make a neutral expert available to the defense, potentially shared with the prosecution.Monday\u2019s opinion, by Justice       Stephen Breyer,        said it was unnecessary to decide whether the Ake precedent guaranteed Mr. McWilliams a dedicated expert.\u201cThat is because Alabama here did not meet even Ake\u2019s most basic requirements,\u201d Justice Breyer wrote, joined by       Justices Anthony Kennedy,       Ruth Bader Ginsburg,       Sonia Sotomayor       and       Elena Kagan.Justice Breyer observed that the defense didn\u2019t receive Mr. McWilliams\u2019s mental health records from prison until hours or days before sentencing hearings. When, on the morning of sentencing, a defense attorney protested that he needed more time and expert assistance to interpret the records, the judge gave him until 2 p.m.When the hearing resumed, the judge ruled that Mr. McWilliams had been \u201cfeigning, faking and manipulative\u201d in an attempt to show he was psychotic, and then sentenced him to death.Without saying the Constitution required a dedicated expert for the defense, Justice Breyer wrote that \u201cas a practical matter, the simplest way for a state to meet [the] standard may be to provide a qualified expert retained specifically for the defense team,\u201d a practice that the \u201coverwhelming majority of jurisdictions\u201d follow.Under a 1996 federal law intended to hasten executions, state sentences under review in federal court through a secondary process known as habeas corpus may be reversed if found to be \u201ccontrary to\u201d or \u201can unreasonable application of\u201d clearly established federal law as determined by the U.S. Supreme Court.The court\u2019s majority Monday was unwilling to find that Mr. McWilliams\u2019s sentence met that qualification, possibly because lower courts and legal commentators have found ambiguity in the Ake decision.Justice       Samuel Alito\u2019s       dissent accused the majority of a \u201cmost unseemly maneuver\u201d to correct what it saw as an error in the McWilliams case without declaring it contrary to precedent.Justice Alito observed that in accepting the case, the court specifically took the broad question presented and declined to consider the narrower issue of whether Mr. McWilliams\u2019s trial met the Ake standard.\u201cIt is certainly true that there is language in Ake that points toward the position that a defense-team psychiatrist should be provided,\u201d Justice Alito wrote, joined by Chief Justice       John Roberts,        Justice       Clarence Thomas       and the court\u2019s newest member, Donald Trump appointee       Neil Gorsuch.       \u201cOther language in Ake, however, points at least as strongly in the opposite direction.\u201dAlabama Attorney General Steve Marshall was also dissatisfied.\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision to resolve this case on a question that was not under review and was never briefed by the parties is an affront to the rule of law and, especially, deprives crime victims the opportunity to be heard,\u201d Mr. Marshall said.Stephen Bright,        the lawyer who argued Mr. McWilliams\u2019s case, applauded the ruling.\u201cToday\u2019s decision is about fairness,\u201d Mr. Bright said. \u201cJames McWilliams could not have a fair trial without a mental health expert to assess his brain damage and other mental impairments and to help his counsel present that information to the sentencing court.

Initial auctions, which focused on less-profitable shallow water and onshore blocks, failed to attract the world\u2019s biggest oil companies. But a December auction of deep-water drilling rights attracted a handful of global energy giants including             Exxon Mobil Corp.      ,             Chevron Corp.      ,             Total SA,       Statoil Corp.,             BP                   PLC and others.Juan Carlos Zepeda,        president of the National Hydrocarbons Commission\u2014Mexico\u2019s energy regulator and organizer of the auctions\u2014said the availability of geological information and the low prices of natural gas and heavy crude in the U.S. were two major factors determining which blocks attracted the most competition Monday. The areas thought to contain primarily light crude attracted the most bids.Mr. Zepeda said the first barrels of oil from the fields could be produced by the end of 2018 or early 2019.\u201cLight oil is where we are seeing the most competition and interest,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s more difficulty in the blocks where there is a lot of gas.\u201dMexican state oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos won stakes in two of the blocks up for grabs, one in partnership with Germany\u2019s DEA Deutsche Erdoel and another with Colombia\u2019s             Ecopetrol SA      . In a statement following the auction, Pemex said the two areas it won are close to fields it has already been assigned, which will make it easier to share infrastructure for exploration and development.\u201cPemex is maximizing the resources of the country and demonstrating that it\u2019s a competitive company and a highly attractive and trustworthy partner,\u201d the statement said.Italy\u2019s             Eni                   SpA was the day\u2019s biggest winner, serving as partner in groups that won three blocks. In March, the company said one of its exploratory wells in the Gulf of Mexico, won at an earlier auction, had uncovered reserves that were much higher than previously expected. Mr. Coldwell said representatives of the company had visited with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico in recent months to discuss plans to accelerate its production plans in Mexico.\u201cEni has basically created a beachhead in Mexico and made it clear that Mexico is a strategic destination for their capital,\u201d said       Pablo Medina,        an analyst with Wood Mackenzie who covers Mexico.

A key question about the disaster was what role exterior cladding played in spreading the fire. Footage appeared to show the fire quickly spreading along the outside of the 24-floor tower.Philip Hammond,        the U.K.\u2019s Treasury chief, told the British Broadcasting Corp. on Sunday that the type of cladding used in the building was banned, while the U.K. Department of Communities and Local Government has said its use wasn\u2019t compliant with building regulations.That triggered a detailed rebuttal on Monday from CEP Architectural Facades Ltd., the company that supplied the cladding material to a separate contractor, Harley Facades Ltd., which installed the cladding on the building as part of a refurbishment last year.The cladding, called Reynobond PE, is essentially a sandwich of metal panels around a filling of common plastic known as polyethylene. The plastic can be flammable. The cladding is made by             Arconic                   Architectural Products Europe. Its parent company, Arconic Inc., was formed late last year after aluminum giant             Alcoa                   split in two.A similar product, Reynobond FR, uses a fire-retardant filling. It wasn\u2019t used in the Grenfell Tower refurbishment.In the U.S., the use of the PE variety is generally restricted to lower buildings, according to building groups there.CEP Architectural, citing technical guidance from the Building Control Alliance, a U.K. industry body that provides guidance and recommendations for building-code compliance, said the material is compliant with building regulations in England and Wales, rules that would apply to the tower.Key to the Grenfell Tower fire is whether building rules allow for the use of flammable filling like that used in Reynobond PE.Arnold Tarling, a chartered surveyor and fire-safety expert, said the U.K. building regulations did allow for cladding to contain flammable material, as long as it was \u201cfully bonded\u201d to a noncombustible material like aluminum, as is the case with Reynobond PE.The cladding used in Grenfell Tower is like \u201ca sandwich with two sheets of bread that won\u2019t burn, but innards of candle wax that will come out at [certain] temperatures and burn furiously,\u201d he said. He said U.K. building regulations disregard the sandwich filling.He said a separate regulation maintains that any insulation material used in external wall construction for buildings taller than 18 meters, or about 59 feet, should be of \u201climited combustibility\u201d but said that cladding wasn\u2019t generally viewed as insulation and even if it were then bonding aluminum sheets to both faces would make it compliant.CEP Architectural said the material would also be compliant if the system as a whole was subjected to a fire assessment that showed it was safe. It was unclear if any such assessment had been made.\u201cThe key question now is whether the overall design of the building\u2019s complete exterior was properly tested and subsequently signed off by the relevant authorities,\u201d CEP Architectural\u2019s managing director, John Cowley, said.A spokesman for the U.K. Department of Communities and Local Government repeated late Monday it maintained its position that aluminum cladding with a polyethylene core isn\u2019t compliant with regulations for buildings taller than 18 meters.The British government has asked all local authorities to check whether any high-rise housing in their areas use a similar type of cladding to that used in Grenfell Tower. It said it would test any cladding that fit the description to determine its combustibility.Prime Minister       Theresa May       has ordered an inquiry into the fire and police are conducting a criminal investigation.\u201cWe will be looking at all criminal offenses that may have been committed,\u201d police commander       Stuart Cundy       said.Over the weekend, the British government sought to defend itself from accusations it hadn\u2019t done enough to prevent the deadly fire.The Conservative government also came under sharp criticism for not having concluded a review of fire-safety standards prompted by a 2009 fire in a high-rise in south London, which killed six people. Mr. Hammond denied an accusation that the government \u201csat\u201d on the review, which has yet to be published.The mounting pressure on the government follows a major setback in elections this month, when the ruling Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority days before the start of Brexit talks with the European Union.Write to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 18:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/death-toll-rises-to-79-in-londons-grenfell-tower-fire-1497867220", "news_title": "Death Toll Mounts in London\u2019s Grenfell Tower Fire ", "keywords": "aluminum cladding,banned in the u.k.,construction flaws,grenfell tower, london high rise fire, london tower block fire,British Broadcasting Corp.,U.K. Department of Communities and Local Government,Theresa May,Philip Hammond,political,general news,national,public security,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,law enforcement,man-made disasters,broadcasting,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "Employees are ready to return to work at a 110-bed private residential addiction-treatment center in New Jersey after voting to ratify their first union contract, ending a labor dispute that had closed the facility for more than three weeks.The contract addresses some of the staffing and security concerns that Sunrise House\u2019s 120 union members said were their main reasons for voting to go on strike after nearly a year of negotiations with Sunrise House owner, AAC Holdings.

BA 1.27%       is doubling down on a profitable parts and services business that could bring the plane maker into competition with its own suppliers.Boeing has complained for years that other companies profit more selling spare parts and services for its jets and military systems than Boeing makes building them. Boeing says it has just 8% of the business servicing the 10,000 Boeing jetliners and thousands of military jets in service.Now the Chicago-based aerospace giant plans to more than double annual sales in its services business to $50 billion in five years. A new unit overseeing combined commercial and military services will open in Plano, Texas, on July 1. The push is central to Chief Executive       Dennis Muilenburg\u2019s       efforts to cut costs and push up Boeing\u2019s profit margins to the midteens from around 10% now.\u201cI expect them to be accretive to that target,\u201d Mr. Muilenburg said of the new Boeing Global Services business in a recent interview.Aircraft engine makers provide a model. They sell engines for little or no profit, but generate earnings from maintenance and new services that parse reams of data to find ways for airlines to fly more efficiently.             General Electric Co.       has branched into other services such as storing aircraft maintenance records and airline crew data.Boeing hired the head of GE\u2019s services business last year to run its own commercial airplanes arm and wants to take some business from GE and other suppliers.\u201cThere is always going to be this healthy tension,\u201d       Stan Deal,        president of Boeing Global Services, said in an interview.Suppliers are already eyeing Boeing\u2019s move warily.       Eric Schulz,        head of the civil aerospace unit at             Rolls-Royce Holdings                   PLC, said the sector will invest less in the technology needed for Boeing\u2019s next generation of jetliners if the plane maker encroaches too deeply in its turf.Boeing and rival Airbus SE typically make about a third of a commercial jet and rely on suppliers for the rest of the parts. The suppliers in turn make the bulk of their earnings repairing and replacing parts for the airlines, leasing companies and governments that buy the planes from Boeing and Airbus.The plane makers largely ignored the spare parts business, licensing the rights to make them to others, but that is starting to change.\u201cThere are negotiations going on between the suppliers and [plane makers] to give up intellectual property to go down this path,\u201d said Robin Lineberger, head of the aerospace and defense practice at consultant Deloitte.Boeing has already tightened licensing of its own intellectual property of plane parts made by others and is making more parts itself. Mr. Deal, the head of the new services unit, said Boeing wants to drive a cultural shift to generate more money from its products.The company aims to boost annual service product launches from 17 last year to 100 over the next several years, taking on more work from carriers eager to cut their own fixed costs and capital spending.Boeing aims to use data from aircraft and airline operations to price its planned offerings more competitively.\u201cWe\u2019ve got very comfortable with taking more operational risk,\u201d Mr. Deal said.Boeing also wants to service rivals\u2019 planes, said Mr., Deal.Fabrice Br\u0117gier,        president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said at the Paris air show this week that he admired Boeing\u2019s chutzpah.\u201cI am very pleased to know that Boeing without the knowledge of Airbus aircraft knows how to maintain Airbus aircraft,\u201d he told reporters ahead of the Paris Air show.He joked that the move made sense because Airbus planes are so easy to maintain, adding Airbus will remain focused on selling and servicing its own planes.\u2014Robert Wall contributed to this article.Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Boeing Aims to Expand Parts Unit.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 17:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-eyes-higher-sales-in-parts-and-services-1497909517", "news_title": "Boeing Eyes Higher Sales in Parts and Services ", "keywords": "boeing, boeing parts, boeing services, boeing strategy,Boeing,BA,Boeing Global Services,General Electric,GE,Rolls-Royce Holdings,UK:RR.,Airbus SE,FR:AIR,Dennis Muilenburg,Stan Deal,Eric Schulz,Robin Lineberger,Fabrice Br\u0117gier,plans,strategy,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,machinery,aerospace products,parts,civil aircraft,aerospace,defense,industrial goods,packaging"}, {"content": "Republican mayoral candidate       Paul Massey       says he has the solution to New York City\u2019s transit woes.Amid a rise in delays on subway lines and commuter railroads, Mr. Massey, a former real-estate executive, said his campaign would roll out \u201cfive transformative projects\u201d in the coming weeks to ease commutes and improve infrastructure.One Massey proposal promises \u201can immediate solution\u201d to the planned closure of the subway\u2019s L line, which is slated to shut down for 15 months beginning in 2019 to undergo critical repairs.

Security Council resolutions that have been developed to address North Korea\u2019s illicit weapons programs, and we are trying to get all countries to take actions to increase the pressure on North Korea through sanctions implementation and other measures.\u201dWednesday\u2019s meetings are the latest iteration of bilateral talks between Washington and Beijing that began under the Bush administration. During the Obama administration, economic, diplomatic and security issues were handled on a single track. The Trump administration has altered the format, so that economic ties have their own session.

Instinctively, she said, she jumped from her bed to check on her 4-year-old daughter.\u201cI just knew in my bones it was another horror,\u201d said Ms. Ali, a 27-year-old university student.Police had flooded into Ms. Ali\u2019s north London neighborhood in response to the fourth terror attack in Britain since March\u2014this time by an assailant who plowed a rented van into a crowd of Muslims leaving Ramadan prayers. One man died and eight others were rushed to the hospital.It was the latest in a troubling litany of events this year that has exposed divisions in the U.K. along lines of religion, ethnicity and class, fraying a nation, and particularly a capital, that prides itself on keeping calm and carrying on.\u201cThese have been a terrible few weeks for London, unprecedented in recent times,\u201d the city\u2019s mayor,       Sadiq Khan,        said Monday, before urging citizens to stay strong.Monday\u2019s violence came days after a fire in a public-housing complex that left at least 79 people dead and missing, according to the latest official tally. That disaster has focused attention on the wide disparities between London\u2019s rich and poor and led to protests by critics who blame government spending cuts and lax enforcement of safety rules for the blaze and the shockingly high death toll.Earlier in June, three Islamist extremists rammed pedestrians with a van on London Bridge and stabbed others, killing eight people and injuring dozens before they were shot and killed by police. In March, another Islamist terrorist\u2014also using a vehicle and a knife\u2014killed five, including a policeman guarding Parliament.In between those two attacks, a suicide bomber in May killed 22 people at a pop concert in the northwestern British city of Manchester.That string of violence, sustained by Monday\u2019s assault on Muslims, raised fears for some of further copycat and revenge attacks. London\u2019s police force, already stretched as it provides heightened security in the capital, on Monday said it would step up protection at mosques.Britain and its government are grappling with all this amid great political uncertainty. Prime Minister       Theresa May       suffered a serious setback in national elections this month and was weakened after her Conservative Party lost its majority in Parliament.At the same time, on Monday, formal talks began on Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union\u2014a process that will redefine the country\u2019s place in the world after decades as a member of the bloc.\u2018It could possibly be\u2014I don\u2019t really want to say it\u2014but London is falling at the moment.\u2019Ali Ibrahim,        a 23-year-old graduate student who witnessed Monday\u2019s attack, said hatred and divisions within society feel palpable after so much violence in such a short period of time.\u201cIf we\u2019re united, we can overcome,\u201d Mr. Ibrahim said. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s a lot of turmoil, with this Brexit, a hung Parliament.

Tourists throng the city\u2019s attractions. And the vast majority of people are going on about their lives as usual. But there is an undercurrent of unease.Michael Biggs,        a University of Oxford sociologist, said the climate today feels different from the frustration that erupted in August 2011, when four nights of rioting led to more than 1,000 arrests and more than $300 million in damages. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything really that would give an indication\u201d that the recent events would lead to public disorder, he said.Unlike in 2011, he said, Britons are expressing a shared sense of injustice over the plight of those affected by the apartment-building fire. He likened that event to the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist fire in New York, which killed 146 immigrant workers and became a watershed moment for workers\u2019 rights.The impact of the latest terror attack was still raw on Monday. Anger mixed with despair as armed police blocked off streets and paramedics gave first aid to the injured. The weather was unusually hot for London, with daytime temperatures in recent days in the 80s.Some witnesses of the crime sat or paced alone nearby. Others loudly voiced their frustration with the government and media.\u201cHe\u2019s a white terrorist,\u201d shouted one man. \u201cTomorrow they will say he is mentally ill,\u201d said another.Mohamed Abdulle,        a 20-year-old who delivers takeaway meals on a motorbike, said he no longer feels safe in London out of feat a similar attack would happen again. He said he was driving just behind the van used in the attack and saw the driver mow down worshipers.\u201cI don\u2019t think I will go to the mosque after what happened last night,\u201d said Mr. Abdulle, who moved to London six months ago from Bristol in southwest England. \u201cAll religions live in London,\u201d he added. \u201cThis should not be happening.\u201d\u2018There has\u00a0been a cycle of violence recently.

Adrian Newman,        the Anglican bishop of Stepney, condemned Monday\u2019s violence as appalling. \u201cAn attack on any faith is an attack on us all,\u201d he said.Mrs. May tried to assuage Muslims\u2019 fears and called for a crackdown on extremism of all kinds, saying Monday\u2019s\u00a0assault was \u201cevery bit as sickening\u201d as the ones that came before.\u201cIt was an attack that once again targeted the ordinary and the innocent going about their daily lives\u2014this time British Muslims as they left a Mosque having broken their fast and prayed together at this sacred time of year.\u201dFearing further backlash against the Muslim community, Ms. Ali, the university student, said she wouldn\u2019t be taking her daughter to school for at least two weeks.

You ask rhetorically, \u201cAre you paying attention, Illinois and Connecticut?\u201d The clear implication is that Illinois hasn\u2019t acted to reduce the future costs of its pension plans.In 2010 Illinois was one of the first states to drastically reduce future pension benefits for new teachers and public workers to cut costs. The Illinois plan was more extreme than the changes implemented in Pennsylvania.The Tier II benefit structure in Illinois essentially reduced by 30% the value of a public pension for new hires after 2011. Tier II members will pay for the entire cost of their pensions while subsidizing the pensions of older Tier I colleagues. Tier II members must work seven years longer to be eligible for a pension and will receive smaller cost-of-living adjustments in retirement.Illinois currently has an unfunded pension liability of $130 billion because the state hasn\u2019t once in 78 years fully funded its pension systems. As a result, this year $3.6 billion of the state\u2019s $9.4 billion pension contribution covers the actual cost of benefits. The remaining $5.8 billion is for the unfunded liability.The truth is Illinois has been paying attention.

IngramExecutive DirectorTeachers\u2019 Retirement System of the State of IllinoisSpringfield, Ill.You have often detailed the fiscal problems of Illinois and Connecticut. The Illinois and Connecticut budget deficits and public-employee pension liabilities have been attributed to Democratic governors, legislatures and their public-employee union allies.Until 2000 Pennsylvania had a public-pension system that was overfunded. In May 2001, Republican Gov.       Tom Ridge       and a Republican legislature engineered a 25% increase in state-employee pensions for the future and retroactively. It gave lawmakers a 50% pension boost. Soon after, 9/11 sent financial markets tumbling and state-employee pension funding became a state crisis.The Pennsylvania legislature has been dominated by Republicans since then and movement to correct this problem has been slow. Democrats and public-employee unions aren\u2019t always at fault for these public-pension problems.John SchenkelLancaster, Pa.The employer (Pennsylvania taxpayers) contributions will remain above 30% for years to come. No business could survive mandatory payments at these levels, but state agencies can.Pennsylvania\u2019s 500 school districts, for example, with the power of direct taxation, have raised property taxes every year to cover these outrageous expenses, while ironically amassing $4.4 billion in their fund balances. In the last 10 years employer contributions have increased from 6.46% to 30.3% of salary; the rate in the 2017-18 school year is 32.57% and will increase to 36.4% by the 2021-22 school year.These unsustainable payments won\u2019t shave one dollar from the unfunded pension liability as they push school property taxes through the roof and more residents to other states.Are you paying attention, Pennsylvania?Joel SearsYork, Pa.", "news_time": "2017-06-19 16:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-state-solution-to-pension-underfunding-1497904791", "news_title": "Two-State Solution to Pension Underfunding?", "keywords": "pension reforms,pension underfunding,political,general news,education,letters,routine general news"}, {"content": "Peter Wallison is right in \u201cThe Filibuster Is Not a Suicide Pact\u201d (op-ed, June 2).

Those decisions helped prompt him to sell all his Venezuelan bonds. \u201cPersonally, it\u2019s not the policy I would be choosing at this time,\u201d Mr. House said. \u201cIt feels very uncomfortable\u2026on many levels.\u201dA crisis of conscience is rippling through emerging markets, where portfolio managers are asking: Dare we hold on to Venezuelan bonds, let alone buy new ones, knowing that the authoritarian government of President       Nicol\u00e1s Maduro       is choosing to pay lenders rather than feed its people?After borrowing tens of billions from global investors in recent years, the country is spiraling into a humanitarian crisis. Venezuela\u2019s $56 billion of outstanding debt makes up 3.5% of a widely followed emerging-market debt benchmark. Adding to the dilemma for investors, the 24% yield on some Venezuela bonds places them among the highest-yielding investments in the sector, and the debt has been one of the biggest winners on Wall Street over the past year.While other countries, such as Turkey, also have poor human-rights records, the street protests and widespread hunger that are unfolding in Venezuela, the third-largest oil supplier to the U.S., feel more acute for many U.S. investors.\u201cIn my memory, there\u2019s never been this kind of case for the emerging bond markets,\u201d said       Mohamed El-Erian,        a founding figure in the market who is now chief economist for             Allianz Group.The issue came to the fore in recent weeks when The Wall Street Journal reported that             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s       investment arm bought bonds held by the country\u2019s central bank and that the government is trying to sell $5 billion more debt, at a steep discount.The integration of socially responsible rules into investment decisions has been around in stock funds for decades, but it is virtually absent in the bond world.The last great divestment controversy\u2014South Africa under apartheid\u2014predates the development of modern emerging-market bond trading in the late 1980s. Countries with controversial governments like Iraq, Nigeria and Mozambique have issued international bonds, but the three together make up less than 1% of the market.The moral calculus can grow complicated. Some investors say providing new funding to the Maduro government, as Goldman Sachs did, is unacceptable but that buying from other funds does no harm. Others say owning any Venezuelan bond is unethical because the money the country uses to service debt would be better spent feeding its populace.Investors are also divided over the impact of divestiture. Bond yields would likely rise further, making it even harder for the government to borrow and perhaps accelerating political change. But creditors could also seize oil shipments in the case of default, cutting off the nation\u2019s primary source of dollars and further curtailing imports.\u201cOur goal is to lend money to a government, helping grow its economy and improve people\u2019s living standards, and eventually we hope to get paid,\u201d said       Yong Zhu,        senior portfolio manager at DuPont Capital Management, which owns Venezuelan debt.Russ Dallen,        a managing partner at Caracas Capital Markets, said that Venezuela\u2019s problem was the result of \u201ca breakdown in democracy.\u201d Venezuela is set to hold voting for a new constituent assembly in July. \u201cWall Street does not function like a moral place. It\u2019s a sad truth,\u201d he said.Venezuela\u2019s bonds have paid remarkably well, returning 54% in the year through May. That accounted for one-fifth of the             J.P. Morgan                   Emerging Markets Bond Index Global\u2019s return over the period. Many fund managers are reluctant to divest because they fear lagging behind rivals who hold on. Others are betting that recoveries in a default would exceed market prices. With its bonds trading at an average price around 50 cents on the dollar, a default by Venezuela is considered nearly inevitable in the near future.\u201cWe have a fiduciary duty to represent the interests of our shareholders in our Emerging Markets Debt fund,\u201d said a spokesman for MFS Investment management, which owns Venezuelan bonds worth about $142 million, according to data from             Morningstar Inc.U.S. mutual funds in May owned about $2.5 billion of Venezuelan government bonds, according to Morningstar. Fidelity Investments own bonds worth about $790 million and             T. Rowe Price Group Inc.       owns about $407 million. Representatives for Fidelity and T. Rowe declined to comment.But the tide is starting to turn. Nearly 41% of the 81 U.S.-based emerging-market debt funds have zero exposure to Venezuela, up from 34% a year ago, according to Morningstar Inc.Eaton Vance Corp.       portfolio manager       John Baur       sold his Venezuelan bonds in the fall of 2016 because he expected recoveries in a default to be below market prices. Political and ethical concerns played no part in the decision, he said, but selling out was still a relief.\u201cNow I don\u2019t have to worry about the ethics anymore,\u201d Mr. Baur said.Some in the U.S. government are turning up the pressure on investors. Senator       Marco Rubio       (R., Fla.) \u201cis privately encouraging financial institutions to respect the will of the Venezuelan people and not to give a lifeline to the imploding Maduro regime,\u201d a spokeswoman for Mr. Rubio said. The U.S. has placed sanctions on members of the Maduro administration but not on the country as a whole.The Oppenheimer International Bond Fund, which invests about half of its $5.2 billion in assets in emerging markets, hasn\u2019t owned Venezuela for at least two years, said       Hemant Baijal,        co-head of the global debt team at OppenheimerFunds.\u201cThere are so many other investments that have had very high returns,\u201d Mr. Baijal said.Corrections & Amplifications   Venezuela is set to hold voting for a new constituent assembly in July.

It has been fighting a legal battle to save its trademarks after the Patent and Trademark Office canceled them in 2014 on the grounds that they disparaged Native Americans.Similarly, the office declined to register a trademark for the Slants after finding that people of Asian descent would likely find the band\u2019s name derogatory.Band leader       Simon Tam       argued the government\u2019s refusal to register certain trademarks because of their content infringed on the free speech of those expressing disfavored or negative viewpoints.The Supreme Court agreed, in an opinion written by Justice       Samuel Alito.\u201cThis provision violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.

But one group of four justices, in a concurring opinion by Justice       Anthony Kennedy,        offered additional views on why the Patent Office should lose.\u201cA law that can be directed against speech found offensive to some portion of the public can be turned against minority and dissenting views to the detriment of all,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote. \u201cThe First Amendment does not entrust that power to the government\u2019s benevolence.\u201dThe court\u2019s new justice,       Neil Gorsuch,        didn\u2019t participate in the case, which was argued before he joined the court.Mr. Tam said his band was fighting racial stereotypes, with the name following a tradition in which members of minority groups have reclaimed derogatory terms and turned them into badges of pride.\u201cThe Supreme Court has vindicated First Amendment rights not only for our The Slants, but all Americans who are fighting against paternal government policies that ultimately lead to viewpoint discrimination,\u201d Mr. Tam said in a statement posted on his             Facebook                   page.Lisa Blatt,        a lawyer for the Redskins football club, said the team was \u201cthrilled\u201d with the ruling, \u201cas it resolves the Redskins\u2019 longstanding dispute with the government. The Supreme Court vindicated the team\u2019s position that the First Amendment blocks the government from denying or canceling a trademark registration based on the government\u2019s opinion.\u201dThe team had filed a brief with the high court supporting Mr. Tam\u2019s case.The court\u2019s ruling invalidated part of the 1946 Lanham Act that barred the registration of trademarks \u201cwhich may disparage\u2026persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols.\u201dEven without a registered federal trademark, companies, groups and individuals can claim some trademark rights to protect a name, logo and other distinctive features.Those rights, however, become stronger once the government registers a mark. Holders of such registered marks enjoy better nationwide legal protections and can seek assistance from U.S. Customs and Border Protection to stop the importation of counterfeit or infringing goods.The Patent Office had warned a win for the Slants would clear the way for the registration of trademarks on even vile racial epithets.An appeals court acknowledged as much when it ruled for the Slants in 2015 but said that the First Amendment protected speech even when it inflicted great pain on others.\u201cWe plan to issue further guidance following a careful review of the Court\u2019s decision,\u201d a Patent Office spokesman said.Lisa Simpson, an intellectual property lawyer with the Orrick law firm, said the decision could lead to a flood of applications for potentially offensive marks, while shifting more responsibility to consumers.\u201cWhile it seems much damage can be done in the interim, it does seem that this is how the First Amendment was intended to work\u2014by fostering and supporting public debate and empowering the public to tell companies and other entities what is acceptable commercial activity and what is not,\u201d Ms. Simpson said.Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Supreme Court Rejects Curbs on Trademarks.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 16:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-government-cant-reject-disparaging-trademarks-1497883992", "news_title": "Supreme Court Rules Government Can\u2019t Reject Disparaging Trademarks ", "keywords": " band, first amendment,free speech, government,justices,offensive,patent and trademark office,patent office,redskins,simon tam,slants,supreme court,the slants,trademarks, washington redskins ,U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,Lisa Blatt,Neil Gorsuch,Samuel Alito,Simon Tam,patents,corporate,industrial news,intellectual property rights,industrial property rights,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch,media,sound publishing,sound,music recording,publishing"}, {"content": "Monterey, Calif.Held June 16-18, 1967, the Monterey International Pop Music Festival is often mistakenly cited as the first rock festival. That honor likely belongs to the Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival, which took place a week earlier in Northern California at Mount Tamalpais. But Monterey established a model for future festivals, much as did D.A. Pennebaker\u2019s documentary \u201cMonterey Pop\u201d for rock-concert films. Intended to position rock as a musical form as important as folk and jazz, which had their own festivals, Monterey Pop\u2019s lineup included       Buffalo Springfield,        the Byrds, the Grateful Dead, the       Jimi Hendrix       Experience, Jefferson Airplane, the Mamas & the Papas,       Laura Nyro,       Lou Rawls,       Otis Redding,        Simon & Garfunkel and the Who.This past weekend, the 50th anniversary of Monterey Pop was celebrated at the same fairgrounds that hosted the original event. Comparing lineups is a fool\u2019s errand: It\u2019s too soon to tell whose reputation will be as burnished as the big names of a half-century ago, but       Leon Bridges,       Gary Clark Jr.      , Father John Misty,       Jim James,       Jack Johnson,        Norah Jones, Regina Spektor and Kurt Vile are among the two-dozen artists who appeared here who have cachet with 21st-century audiences. Remember, in \u201967 few Americans knew Hendrix, Nyro and the Who; and also on that year\u2019s bill were not-so-memorable acts like Beverley, the Group With No Name and the Paupers.Well-organized by producer       Lou Adler,        the Mamas and the Papas\u2019       John Phillips       and others, Monterey Pop \u201967 was also considered the unofficial beginning of the Summer of Love and may have been the counterculture\u2019s high point in live music. There was none of the soppy, mud-soaked anarchy of Woodstock or the violence at the Altamont Speedway Free Festival, held respectively in August and December 1969. As confirmed by Mr. Pennebaker\u2019s films and several Monterey Pop boxed sets released across the years, attendees were served memorable music by many artists, most notably Hendrix,       Janis Joplin,        Redding and       Ravi Shankar.       If the Summer of Love was soon marred by overindulgence in which the use of marijuana and psychedelics went from an amuse-bouche to a gluttonous buffet of life-consuming hard drugs, and if San Francisco\u2019s Haight-Ashbury, the hippie epicenter, devolved into a social cesspool, it wasn\u2019t the fault of Monterey Pop.Fifty years later, musicians performed here unencumbered by outsize social responsibilities to promote peace, love and understanding; and there was something quaint about the way the festival unfolded: With one stage and thus one artist performing at a time\u2014as opposed to as many as six stages in use at major festivals like Bonnaroo and Coachella\u2014the days and nights flowed easily and stress-free. Largely organic and traceable to rock\u2019s past and its predecessors, the music was conveyed with minimal use of synthesizers\u2014the predominant keyboard was the Hammond B-3 organ. Horn sections provided the boost and colors in soul- and R&B-informed sets by       Charles Bradley       and His Extraordinaires,       Nathaniel Rateliff       & the Night Sweats and       Booker T. Jones\u2019s       Stax Revue, among others. There was no punk, post-punk, rap or electronic dance music\u2014apr\u00e8s \u201967 inventions. At age 83, Mr. Adler roamed the fairgrounds and willingly reminisced.The past was present on stage too. Performing on the same date he had 50 years earlier,       Eric Burdon,        his voice worse for wear, sang his \u201cMonterey\u201d\u2014\u201cDo you want to find truth in life? Don\u2019t pass music by\u201d\u2014as well as ancient hits by the Animals. Mr. Jones and his M.G.\u2019s backed Redding here 50 years ago; on Sunday, his new revue honored him by playing \u201cRespect\u201d and \u201c(Sittin\u2019 On) The Dock of the Bay,\u201d the latter prompting a whistle-a-long from the audience. Grateful Dead bassist       Phil Lesh       closed out the festival with his project, the Terrapin Family Band. A less obvious link to Monterey Pop \u201967 was an appearance by Ms. Jones, who is Shankar\u2019s daughter. In a deeply satisfying set, she hopscotched her still-blossoming career, opening with jazz tunes informed by New Orleans before leaving the piano and picking up a guitar to play country, accompanied by a pining pedal steel.Others excelled too. Sparked by a tasty performance by guitarist       Josh Kaufman,       M.C. Taylor\u2019s       Hiss Golden Messenger played country rock with admirable ease. Mr. Clark, a Hendrix fan, eschewed his predecessor\u2019s histrionics to deliver a Sunday evening set of punishing blues and feathery soul. Exploring his solo catalog, Mr. James (most famously of My Morning Jacket) married hip-hop rhythms to psychedelia for his weighty tales of a frayed society. As for Father John Misty, the stage name of       Josh Tillman,        the sardonic character he plays was in full flower, exploiting his fascinating 2017 orchestral folk-pop album, \u201cPure Comedy.\u201d Their sets were at least comparable in quality to most played a half-century ago.Which wasn\u2019t the point. If Monterey Pop 1967 set out to rocket rock and pop toward the cultural touchstone it became, Monterey Pop 2017\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t so ambitious. It presented music that draws from the past, shines in the present and promises a fine future. Having achieved and at times exceeded that modest goal, the festival was a thoroughly enjoyable success.\u2014Mr. Fusilli is the Journal\u2019s rock and pop music critic.

The yield marked the highest close since March 14 when it settled at 1.380%, the highest close since June 2009. Yields rise as bond prices fall.The yield on the benchmark 10-year note was 2.188%, compared with 2.157% Friday.Investors sold Treasury debt after New York Federal Reserve President       William Dudley      held an upbeat assessment over the economy, suggesting that reports of slowing inflation haven\u2019t caused any worries.Mr. Dudley said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that there is \u201cquite a long ways to go\u201d in the economic expansion, already the third-longest in U.S. history.His remarks followed the Fed\u2019s decision last week to raise short-term interest rates. Fed officials stuck to their projections of an additional rate increase in 2017 and three more in 2018, even as some investors expect slowing inflation to derail the Fed\u2019s plan.\u201cDudley\u2019s message to the bond market is that the Fed sticks to its rate-hike plan,\u201d said       Edward Fitzpatrick,        portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Mr. Fitzpatrick said he expects the two-year yield to climb to between 1.625% and 2% at the end of this year if the Fed raises rates again later this year.In the years past, Mr. Dudley and Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       were considered by investors as strong doves in the Fed circle as they had been leading advocates that the U.S. economy needs support of ultraloose monetary stimulus. Their stance on monetary policy appeared to be less dovish than before. Ms. Yellen surprised many investors last week when she didn\u2019t blink on the soft inflation data.But the selling pressure following last week\u2019s Fed meeting has been mild in the bond market. The 10-year yield remains near its 2017 closing low of 2.138%, set last Wednesday. For the year, the yield has been down from 2.446% at the end of 2016.The decline of long-term bond yields, with its yield premium relative to the two-year note last week falling to the lowest since last September, reflects some investors\u2019 concerns that the Fed\u2019s pace of rate increases may uncut the economic growth momentum. Anxiety has been rising lately over whether the Fed may make a policy error by tightening policy with inflation readings falling below the central bank\u2019s 2% target again.\u201cIt is a fairly significant vote of no confidence in the Fed\u2019s policy and inflation forecast,\u201d said       Ethan Harris,        head of global economics research at             Bank of America                   Merrill Lynch.Mr. Dudley argued that lower long-term bond yields and a shrinking yield premium have been driven by global money flows due to more appealing yields in the U.S. relative to those offered by many other developed countries. He downplays the notion that the bond market signals the economy is losing momentum.Derivatives markets linked to the Fed\u2019s policy are showing skepticism toward the Fed. Fed-fund futures, a popular derivative market for hedge funds and money managers to bet on the Fed\u2019s policy outlook, suggested chances of 46% that the Fed would raise rates again by its December 2017 meeting, according to             CME Group.       The probability was measured at 41% on Friday.The New York Fed\u2019s model projected Friday a 1.9% growth rate for the world\u2019s largest economy during the second quarter, down from 2.3% in an earlier forecast.Some investors say the Fed may be forced to stand pat later this year if further data show disappointing growth or more deceleration in inflation. Ms. Yellen said last week that monetary policy isn\u2019t on a preset course, signaling her flexibility in the tightening plan.Bond buyers may be vulnerable if the Fed gets it right on their assessment over growth and inflation, say some traders. In this case, selling may hit the bond market as investors readjust their expectations over the Fed\u2019s tightening pace.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 15:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-dudley-pushes-two-year-yield-to-near-a-2017-high-1497882395", "news_title": "Fed\u2019s Dudley Pushes Two-Year Yield to Near a 2017 High", "keywords": "bond yields,federal reserve,interest rates,monetary policy,treasurys,treasury yields,u.s. bonds,Federal Reserve,Edward Fitzpatrick,William Dudley,Ethan Harris,Janet Yellen,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,routine market,financial news,treasury bond prices,commentary,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Oil prices turned lower Monday, failing to hold on to earlier gains as the stubborn glut of oil in storage continued to weigh on the market.U.S. crude futures settled down 54 cents, or 1.21%, at $44.20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Iran received a 12-month reprieve from sanctions at last year\u2019s FATF meeting following the nuclear deal. It was an opportunity for Tehran to prove its commitments to fiscal propriety and to distance itself from funding acts of terror.That reprieve has been for naught. One year later, Iran remains the world\u2019s leading state-sponsor of terrorism. It has done little to enact the anti-money laundering policies requested by the FATF. With no proof of tangible results, the FATF must call on its members to bring back the sanctions against Iran.Iran\u2019s duplicity stems from the power dynamic between President       Hassan Rouhani       and the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Politics and policy are controlled by Ayatollah Khamenei and enforced via the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Mr. Rouhani doesn\u2019t have much of an independent policy legacy to speak of, despite his efforts to project a moderate and more democratic veneer. Even agreeing to the nuclear deal was ultimately Mr. Khamenei\u2019s decision.The powers in control in Tehran loathe what it considers to be the West\u2019s meddling in its domestic affairs, and often lashes out in response to external pressure. We see this with every joint Iranian-North Korean missile test that violates United Nations Resolution 2231. And it has been much the same for the FATF, with no change in either Iran\u2019s money-laundering policies or in winding down its terror funding over the past year.Some countries still wish to give Iran a free pass, even though the FATF recommends that \u201ccountries should criminalise terrorist financing on the basis of the Terrorist Financing Convention, and should criminalise not only the financing of terrorist acts but also the financing of terrorist organisations and individual terrorists even in the absence of a link to a specific terrorist act or acts.\u201dOver the past year, Iran has continued to provide money, weapons, training and troops to the cause of terrorism throughout the Middle East. From the Houthis in Yemen to propping up       Bashar Assad\u2019s       forces in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon and supporting Shiite militias in Iraq, there\u2019s no shortage of examples of Iranian influence over some of the most violent groups in the world.When it comes to its role in funding terrorism, Iran has gone so far as to dub organizations such as Hezbollah a \u201cliberation movement\u201d to create a loophole in its 2015 terrorist-financing legislation. This is unacceptable. The FATF should reinstate sanctions against Tehran until it adopts a credible legal architecture to combat the financing of terrorism. Reinstating this global label would warn the financial community to avoid business with Iran.Money laundering poses its own business risks and is a threat to the safety and soundness of Western financial institutions. The Iranian regime uses its network of ostensibly legitimate business supporters to conceal the origins of illegally obtained money. This potentially makes financial institutions unwitting participants in a money-laundering operation, tarnishing their reputation and increasing their liability for massive fines and penalties.The FATF is primed to provide a thorough and just assessment of Iran\u2019s efforts in the past year. We hope it does so. The nuclear deal provided the space and opportunity for Iran to demonstrate its commitment to stopping the flow of funds to terror groups and rolling back its money-laundering operations. But Iran squandered this opportunity.We encourage the FATF to not only call on its members to reinstate sanctions against Iran, but that they implement more-stringent resolutions as the organization itself recommends for every jurisdiction that poses a threat to the global financial system.Mr. Lieberman, the former U.S. senator from Connecticut and 2000 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, is chairman of United Against Nuclear Iran.

Anything goes during the Venetian Carnival season, and the humor of this historically informed production reflects the opera\u2019s spirit, in which everything is open for teasing and nothing is serious. As the final chorus declares, \u201cLet\u2019s sing, let\u2019s dance, let\u2019s make the most of the these fine days; they won\u2019t last forever.\u201dThe slimmest of plots features two lovers and two jealous rivals. It\u2019s a device for a five-act celebration that includes lots of dancing, fabulously and variously choreographed in period style by       Caroline Copeland      ; an appearance by the goddess Minerva; genre scenes with exotic ethnic types, gondoliers, onstage musicians and even a dancing bear; a grand ball; and, best of all, an Italian opera\u2014a condensed and ridiculous version of the Orpheus story, the most talismanic of all opera plots.Both the music and the show were lively and colorful, dizzying in their quick switches from plot to festivity. Mr. Blin, who also designed the sets, and       Anna Watkins,        who created the spectacular costumes, kept raising the stakes. The funny little directorial touches, like characters appearing to slip on the iced-over Venetian canal and the elaborate disguises of three bumbling assassins, paved the way for big ones, like the painted curtain that instantly turned the Grand Canal into the interior of an opera house, and, of course, the whole opera-within-an-opera. In an evening with numerous high points, this was the most delightful, with its egomaniacal lead tenor, dancing demons in fiery red and orange, and an onstage \u201caudience\u201d interacting, often inappropriately, with the \u201cperformers.\u201dThe splendid cast of more than three-dozen singers and dancers was ablaze with energy.       Jesse Blumberg       (Leandre) and       Amanda Forsythe       (Isabelle) were charming as the lovers; their finest moment was an exquisite Italian serenade.       Douglas Williams       raged amusingly as the jealous Rodolphe; he and       Karina Gauvin       (Leonore) were especially funny in their argument over who is responsible for the assassination that they don\u2019t yet know was botched (the onstage theorbo player was targeted by mistake).       Aaron Sheehan       was superbly funny as the white-wigged, dulcet-voiced but clueless Orfeo; other standouts included       Mireille Lebel,       Teresa Wakim,       Molly Netter,        Christian Immler and       Jason McStoots,        all in multiple roles.

Even then, the battle for insurance approval of PCSK9 inhibitors is successful less than half the time, according to several recent studies.Ms. Cirrincione hasn\u2019t yet been approved despite her and her doctor\u2019s numerous applications and efforts. She was diagnosed four years ago with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic disorder that causes high cholesterol because the liver is unable to remove excess LDL. Her cholesterol at the time of her diagnosis was off the charts, with a total of 387 mg/dL and an LDL level more than four times what doctors recommend for FH patients, at 297 mg/dL.High levels of cholesterol, a fatlike substance, can build up in the arteries and slow down or block blood flow to the heart, causing heart disease and heart attacks, and to the brain, causing strokes. Doctors typically recommend LDL levels no higher than 100 mg/dL for healthy individuals and less than 70 mg/dL for those with heart disease.Most people with high cholesterol try to bring it down with a combination of healthy diet, exercise and drugs known as statins, such as atorvastatin (brand name Lipitor) and rosuvastatin (Crestor). But these drugs can\u2019t always get LDL levels low enough for FH patients. And for some, like Ms. Cirrincione, statins aren\u2019t an option because they cause severe muscular aches.Some doctors believe PCSK9 inhibitors could be a lifesaving solution for millions of heart-disease patients and could transform treatment for the most difficult cases\u2014patients with FH, as well as those with a history of heart disease or stroke for whom statins and other therapies are inadequate. Drug companies estimated the target population to be 11 million patients.But other doctors say that until drug companies can prove PCSK9 inhibitors will reduce the number of deaths caused by heart disease, not just their ability to reduce heart attacks and strokes, the drugs aren\u2019t worth the high price.The two PCSK9 inhibitors currently on the market were approved in 2015.             Amgen Inc.       makes the drug Repatha (evolocumab), which has a list price of about $14,536 a year.             Sanofi SA       and             Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.       makes Praluent (alirocumab), which has a list price of $14,600 a year. The medicines are new entrants in a group of extremely costly drugs that have cropped up in recent years.Doctors, consumers and lawmakers have spoken out against escalating drug prices. The criticism has triggered hearings in Congress. A public furor over the high cost of EpiPen allergic-reaction treatments also led manufacturer, Mylan NV, to began selling a generic version of the devices that sells for half the $609 list price.Doctors and researchers say part of the reason PCSK9 inhibitors are priced so high is because they are a fully human monoclonal antibody, which is harder to manufacture than a normal pill. Patients inject them into their bodies every two to four weeks.Sanofi and Regeneron remain concerned about restrictive access to PCSK9 inhibitors but are starting to see more approvals for Praluent and more confidence from prescribers in preparing the necessary documentation, said       Ashleigh Koss,        a Sanofi spokeswoman.       Kristen Neese,        a spokeswoman for Amgen, said while Repatha isn\u2019t a replacement for statins, \u201cmany patients are not adequately treated by statins and are at high risk for cardiovascular events like heart attack or stroke.\u201d She noted that payers don\u2019t pay the list price for the drug, and the price is supported by \u201crobust\u201d data from its clinical trial. The company is offering support, such as a $5 copay card for eligible patients.For people who are approved by their insurers, high copays can pose an additional barrier to obtaining the drugs. One recent analysis of all PCSK9 inhibitor prescription claims in the first year the drugs were approved found that 27% of claims had a monthly copay of more than $400. The mean copay amount was $107 for patients with commercial insurance plans and $213 for those with government-funded Medicare. Another recent analysis from Duke researchers found that 35% of approved patients never picked up the medication.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this kind of advance for quite a long time,\u201d said       Seth Baum,        president of the American Society for Preventive Cardiology. \u201cWe finally have it, and now we need to be able to use it.\u201dHealth insurers and their consultants say PCSK9 inhibitors have less-expensive alternatives in statin drugs. They also say that the PCSK9 drugs are a lifelong prescription at a high cost.Insurance companies are also mindful of setting a precedent, said       Helen Leis,        a partner in the health and life sciences practice of consulting firm Oliver Wyman, a division of             Marsh & McLennan Co      s. Approving one set of pricey drugs could set a precedent when it comes to other expensive drugs that treat a larger population, such as cancer drugs.In 2016, 88.4% of patients with a commercial insurance plan were rejected when trying to get a new prescription for a PCSK9 inhibitor, according to data from Symphony Health Solutions. That number declined to 72.8% after 14 days, likely due to patient appeals.Doctors have had mixed reactions to results of Amgen\u2019s clinical trial for its drug, Repatha, announced in March. The study followed 27,564 patients over 2.2 years and found that Repatha reduced the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 20% compared with the standard treatment with statins.For Dr. Baum, the trial was proof that that PCSK9 inhibitors are very effective, showing they could lower LDL by 60%. \u201cWe do know unequivocally that a lower LDL equals a lower risk of heart attack, stroke and death,\u201d said Dr. Baum, who has been paid as a consultant and scientific board member for Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron.But some doctors say the study would have been more convincing if the drug had lowered the heart attack risk more and caused a decline in deaths. The lower LDL \u201cdidn\u2019t translate into a mortality benefit,\u201d said       Sanjay Kaul,        a cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.Some health plans have entered into \u201cvalue-based\u201d contracts with drug companies, in which the drug company gives the insurer discounts on the drugs if the medicines don\u2019t help patients lower their cholesterol levels as much as expected.For the highest-risk patients, such as       Scott Sayers,        these drugs seem essential.The 48-year-old homicide detective was diagnosed with high cholesterol when he was 12 years old, tested after his father had bypass surgery at the age of 39. His doctors tried statins for decades, though they eventually wound up causing muscle tears.       Mr. Sayer      s later had his own double-bypass heart surgery at 39 and a mild heart attack at 45. He remembers crying in his hospital bed, fearful that he was going down the same path as his dad.He was diagnosed with FH last year after a genetic test showed he had two mutated genes, though he had been clinically diagnosed more than a decade before. Mr. Sayers\u2019s 13-year-old daughter was also diagnosed when she was 9. In 2015 he and his doctors applied for Repatha.Getting approval was time-consuming but ultimately worked. His cardiologist, Dr.       Melissa Carry,        says the results of the genetic test helped in getting approval from his insurer.He gets deliveries of the drug every three months, so every time he\u2019s coming up on three months he starts calling. \u201cA lot of people will just give up and just quit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve had such massive results.\u201d By November of 2016 his total cholesterol was 120 mg/dL. His LDL, 60 mg/dL, the lowest it has ever been. At one point his LDL levels reached 348 mg/dL.FH is a genetic disorder that causes high cholesterol from birth because the liver is unable to remove excess LDL, which is known as bad cholesterol from the blood stream. High levels of cholesterol lead to heart disease and stroke, among other health problems. FH is usually inherited from one parent with a dominant gene. It is estimated that about one in 250 people have FH, which translates into 1.3 million patients in the U.S. and 30 million world-wide. Experts say that only about 10% of patients in the U.S. that have FH have been diagnosed. Most doctors view it as a rare disorder, and even though the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal cholesterol screening for children between the ages of 9 and 11, it isn\u2019t always done.FH patients have a 50% chance of passing on the disorder to each of their children. LDL levels of 190 mg/dL or more in adults, or over 160 mg/dL in children, and a family history of early heart disease are red flags for doctors to consider FH may be present. Untreated, FH patients have a 2.5- to 10-fold increased risk of having heart disease. Men who aren\u2019t treated have a 50% risk of having a heart attack by age 50, while untreated women have a 30% risk for having one by age 60.FH is diagnosed using a series of clinical criteria based on personal and family history, blood cholesterol and potentially genetic testing, although genetic testing is rarely done in the U.S.Sources: FH Foundation; Joshua Knowles, Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease; Seth Baum, American Society for Preventive Cardiology.PCSK9 inhibitors are \u201cvery expensive drugs\u201d and less expensive generic drugs, like statins, effectively treat most patients with high cholesterol, says       Christine Cramer,        senior director of corporate communications for             CVS Health,       the parent of Mr. Sayer\u2019s drug-benefit manager Caremark. CVS Caremark has processes in place to ensure that such patients have access to these drugs, said Ms. Cramer.The approval process for PCSK9 inhibitors, which requires different criteria depending on the insurer, has become so cumbersome and time-consuming that some doctors have completely stopped or cut back on even prescribing them even though the doctors fully believe in their potential.Andres Ruiz,        an interventional cardiologist in Florida, is one.\u201cAt the end of the day, you would like to do what is best for the patient. But you really don\u2019t have the time to play the insurance games,\u201d he said.\u2018The estimated number of people who could benefit from PCSK9 inhibitor drugs: 11 million. \u2019Doctors say many rejections affect patients with heart disease and FH patients, such as Carlyn Cirrincione, who stopped taking statins because of side effects.Her mom, Tracey, had never heard of FH until four years ago, when the 45-year-old Gibsonia, Pa., resident learned that all three of her children have the genetic disorder. Her husband also has FH.Mrs. Cirrincione\u2019s sons\u2014now 18 and 20\u2014take statins, which have also been effective for her husband. But Carlyn, who recently graduated from Clarion University of Pennsylvania with a graduate degree in speech pathology, can\u2019t take statins, which after several tries caused debilitating muscular pain.In 2015 her cardiologist told the family that PCSK9 inhibitors were approved for FH, and Carlyn started samples of Repatha. By April of last year her LDL was down to 82 mg/dL.Ms. Cirrincione\u2019s cardiologist has now filed three applications for Repatha. All three have been denied.A spokeswoman for UPMC Health Plan, the family\u2019s current insurance plan, said it doesn\u2019t discuss individual members\u2019 cases.While the most recent application is on appeal, Ms. Cirrincione continues to receive samples of Repatha from her cardiologist. \u201cThe samples will run out. Then what do I do?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have open heart surgery when I\u2019m 40 or 50 when I have something I can take to prevent it.\u201dFor       Nancy Harris,        a 66-year-old resident of Pataskala, Ohio, it took 18 months and half-a-dozen applications and appeals to get her insurance plan,             Cigna,       to finally cover a PCSK9 inhibitor last month.Her doctor,       Scott Merryman       at Ohio Health in Columbus, diagnosed her with FH in June 2016, after she\u2019d been on and off statins for years. His office applied for coverage of Repatha with Cigna even though she had been rejected in the past when a previous doctor had applied. Cigna rejected the request initially and then again on appeal.Dr. Merryman applied for coverage again in March. His office received a rejection on March 22 and he sent in another appeal. On May 23, four days after a Wall Street Journal reporter had submitted a request to discuss its denials of Ms. Harris\u2019s applications, Cigna approved coverage of Repatha for her.Cigna\u2019s repeated rejections of applications for Ms. Harris were because it didn\u2019t have documentation of an FH diagnosis and unsuccessful prior treatment with statins, said Mark Slitt, a spokesman. Mr. Slitt noted that Cigna\u2019s coverage denial was upheld by an external reviewer. On May 23, Cigna received the additional requested information, Mr. Slitt said.Dr. Merryman said he had previously provided that information.Ms. Harris said she\u2019s relieved to finally have been approved, but worried about the renewal process.\u201cI am a little worried,\u201d she said. \u201cAre we going to have to go through this every year?\u201dWrite to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'A Cholesterol Drug Tug-of-War DRUG.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 14:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-cholesterol-drugs-cost-14-000-an-insurance-tug-of-war-1497889667", "news_title": "When Cholesterol Drugs Cost $14,000, an Insurance Tug-of-War", "keywords": "bad cholesterol,crestor,familial hypercholesterolemia,heart disease,heart drugs,heart medicine,high cholesterol,ldl cholesterol,lipitor,pcsk9 inhibitors,repatha ,statins,zetia,heart,cardiac disease,political,general news,health,living,lifestyle,medical conditions,pharmaceuticals,insurance,health care,life sciences,cholesterol lowering drugs,specialized drugs,medications,financial services"}, {"content": "EQT Corp.        EQT 2.24%       agreed to buy             Rice Energy Inc.        RICE 1.63%       for $6.7 billion in the latest proposed tie-up between energy producers suffering from low oil and gas prices.EQT said the deal was driven by the opportunity to drill longer horizontal wells by adding Rice\u2019s acreage to its own footprint. Rice\u2019s pipeline assets will also allow EQT to get more of its natural gas to markets including the Gulf, and to benefit from benchmark pricing at Henry Hub in Louisiana.Rice shares were up 26% to $24.73 in midafternoon trading Monday, while EQT\u2019s stock fell around 8.5% to below $54. Rice shares had closed Friday at $19.69; they had highs above $33 during a big discovery in 2014.As of Monday morning, Rice had a market value of $4 billion and EQT had a $10.4 billion value. Both have significant amounts of debt and have suffered from the glut of natural gas that has caused gas prices to fall 60% from June 2014.EQT Chief Executive       Steve Schlotterbeck       told an analyst call Monday morning that the deal will create the country\u2019s biggest natural gas producer.       Tim Rezvan,        a managing director at Mizuho Securities, said the combined output would top 3.5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas.Rice shareholders are to receive slightly more than one-third of a share of EQT stock and $5.30 a share in cash, the companies said. The deal is expected to close toward the end of the year.Rice, which focused on the Marcellus Shale in southwestern Pennsylvania and the Utica Shale just across the border in Ohio, drilled a 2014 gas well called Bigfoot 9H that by one measure ranks among the most successful in U.S. history. It hit an initial production of 41.7 million cubic feet a day, enough to power every home in Pittsburgh for 36 hours.Even after a year of other gushers in the Utica Shale, Bigfoot still ranked fifth among the most successful in that area at the end of 2015, putting it among the biggest onshore gushers in U.S. history at the time, according to             Morgan Stanley.But both Rice and EQT at times have been victims of their own success. The monster wells and rich reserves they\u2019ve found in both the Utica and the overlapping Marcellus added to a glut that was already severe, helping push prices to record lows as recently as last year.EQT is based in Pittsburgh and focused on Appalachian-area natural gas production, gathering, and transmission, but it hasn\u2019t been able to move all the gas produced there for lack of pipeline capacity and has struggled with low prices for that output.Rice\u2019s network will enable EQT to ship gas to markets in the Midwest and the Gulf, where it can fetch better prices.The Wall Street Journal had reported earlier Monday that a deal was imminent.Rice made its stock-market debut in January 2014 in an initial public offering that valued the stake of its controlling Rice family at $900 million.The stock\u2019s strong start fizzled that summer when oil prices began to fall, prompting a broad selloff in energy stocks, including those of U.S. gas producers.Chief Executive       Daniel Rice IV       runs the company alongside younger brothers Toby and Derek, the company\u2019s chief operating officer and exploration head, respectively. A fourth brother, Ryan, joined in 2014 as a petroleum engineer.The patriarch, Daniel Rice III, left BlackRock in 2012 after it failed to disclose Rice Energy\u2019s partnership with a coal producer that was one of the biggest holdings in Mr. Rice\u2019s BlackRock funds.BlackRock in April 2015 agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $12 million to settle claims that it failed to tell clients about a conflict between Mr. Rice\u2019s private holdings and portfolios he supervised for BlackRock clients. Rice Energy had formed a joint venture with publicly traded coal firm             Alpha Natural Resources Inc.,       and by 2011 Alpha was the largest holding in Mr. Rice\u2019s BlackRock Energy & Resources Portfolio.As for the deal Monday,             Citigroup                   acted as financial adviser to EQT and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as legal adviser.

The \u201cmanagers\u201d of winning teams that amass the best statistics take home cash prizes. The companies make money through entry fees.The five-member FTC is currently short-handed, with only two sitting commissioners, one Republican and one Democrat. Both supported the lawsuit. The state of California and the District of Columbia are joining with the FTC to challenge the merger.The commission argues the merger would deprive customers of substantial benefits that are produced by DraftKings and FanDuel competing against one another for business.\u201cWe are disappointed by this decision and continue to believe that a merger is in the best interests of our players, our companies, our employees and the fantasy sports industry,\u201d the companies said in a joint statement. \u201cWe are considering all our options at this time.\u201dWhen they announced the merger in November, the CEOs of the two privately held companies, DraftKings\u2019       Jason Robins       and FanDuel\u2019s       Nigel Eccles,        said combining the companies would allow them to innovate more by freeing up money. That, they said, would further efforts to entice more of players of season-long fantasy sports leagues, and more fans in general, to play on their sites.A few years ago, daily fantasy sports was one of the country\u2019s hottest businesses. It allows players to draft virtual teams that typically compete against one another in a single day, rather than over an entire season as with traditional fantasy leagues. The industry was once forecast to hit $18 billion in revenue by 2021. But that forecast has been slashed\u2014as of late last year standing at around $5.3 billion by 2021\u2014reflecting in part greater-than-expected user burnout and the loss of entire markets because of state regulations.Several state attorneys general have launched regulatory and legal probes, saying the sites violate state gambling laws. The companies, which deny any wrongdoing, have also faced civil lawsuits from consumers, as well as investigations by the Justice Department. The companies have lobbied heavily to try to convince state legislatures to explicitly legalize the activity.DraftKings and FanDuel account for the vast majority of daily fantasy sports players, which they estimate to number around five million. An attorney for FanDuel said when the deal was announced that he expected it to undergo an antitrust review. But he argued that daily sites are one part of a broader fantasy sports universe that includes season-long leagues.The FTC said Monday that season-long sports leagues wouldn\u2019t adequately preserve competition because consumers of paid daily fantasy sports are unlikely to view the season-long contests as a meaningful substitute.DraftKings and FanDuel don\u2019t disclose their valuation, which has likely dropped in the wake of regulatory and legal challenges. Even combined, the companies are relatively small, with FanDuel taking in around $100 million in revenue in 2015.They have had an outsize profile due to heavy advertising and financial backing from major media and sports companies. FanDuel is backed by             Comcast Corp.      , while DraftKings has investments from             21st Century Fox Inc.

The San Jose Mercury News reports that one of the party\u2019s congressional candidates is setting fundraising records. In just two months, this rookie candidate reported receiving more than $450,000 from a total of more than 7,000 California supporters. It\u2019s a remarkable donor base for a first-timer, and it\u2019s even more remarkable considering that the candidate isn\u2019t appearing on any California ballots.His Golden State donors couldn\u2019t care less. Nationwide, progressive leftists have decided that       Jon Ossoff,        who is technically running to fill the U.S. House seat in Georgia vacated by Tom Price, is the perfect vehicle for the anti-Trump \u201cresistance.\u201d Mr. Price is now Mr. Trump\u2019s health secretary.The Boston Globe says that California contributions to Mr. Ossoff over the course of his campaign total at least $1.8 million, more than the $1.3 million the paper estimates he\u2019s collected from New Yorkers, which in turn is more than he appears to have collected from donors in Georgia, where the election actually occurs on Tuesday.Mr. Ossoff is setting fundraising records for a House race, with more than $23 million in total reported contributions. But as the Globe notes, it\u2019s not easy to determine the sources of all the money because campaigns don\u2019t need to collect detailed data on donations of less than $200.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on June 8:While the Boston Globe relies on a ProPublica analysis to say that Massachusetts contributions total at least $500,000, Mother Jones says that the Bay State is also home to critical machinery driving donations to the Democratic candidate. In an article entitled, \u201cThe $2 Billion Powerhouse Behind Jon Ossoff,\u201d the leftist magazine describes how an organization called Act Blue, based outside Boston, channels nationwide progressive rage into money that Mr. Ossoff can spend in Georgia.Armed with roughly five times as much campaign money as GOP opponent Karen Handel, Mr. Ossoff is now clinging to a razor-thin lead, assuming recent polls are to be believed. If elected, will he primarily serve the interests of the moderate suburbanites near Atlanta who vote, or the blue-state leftists who fund his campaign?Mr. Ossoff doesn\u2019t seem to want to answer that question, at least until the polls close on Tuesday night. The estimable Kyle Wingfield, a former Journal colleague and now a columnist for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, describes a recent television debate between the candidates. When asked by the moderator how he would remain independent of the national Democratic party on which he relies for campaign support, Mr. Ossoff managed to entirely avoid answering the question.The Washington Post reports:Can this possibly be true? Nancy Pelosi was elected to Congress the year Mr. Ossoff was born and has been the leader of House Democrats for his entire adult life, including the period when he worked for...a House Democrat. Ms. Pelosi routinely shows up in polls as the best known Member of Congress and according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted earlier this year, a full 82% of Americans have formed an opinion of her. But Georgia voters are now asked to believe not only that Democratic candidate and former congressional aide Jon Ossoff is among the 18% of Americans who don\u2019t have an opinion about Ms. Pelosi; he claims he hasn\u2019t even considered the question.By now Georgia voters may have a sneaking suspicion that just maybe they aren\u2019t getting the straight story from Mr. Ossoff.

Some pushed for carbon subsidies to help plug national shortcomings, while others warned such measures would undermine the bloc\u2019s Paris Agreement commitments.The EU\u2019s internal squabbles come less than three weeks after President       Donald Trump       decided to pull the U.S. out of the global accord to halt climate change, providing an opening for Brussels to become the Paris deal\u2019s cheerleader.Yet so far EU leaders have failed to match words with actions. Delays to two bills that will codify EU efforts to cut emissions threaten the bloc\u2019s ability to finalize its position before November, when the international community aims to clinch guidelines to implement the Paris deal.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s announcement to withdraw from the Paris Agreement put us all face to face with our responsibilities,\u201d       Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete,        European commissioner for climate action and energy, told the bloc\u2019s environment ministers\u00a0Monday. \u201cMore than ever, there is a need for a strong signal from the European Union that we are ready to lead the way.\u201dThe EU over recent months aligned itself with China, the world\u2019s top emitter of greenhouse gasses and the U.S.\u2019s top partner in securing the global agreement, as it became evident Mr. Trump would nix the 2015 accord.Beijing and Brussels agreed to deepen cooperation on implementing the Paris deal during a summit that coincided with Mr. Trump announcing the U.S. exit. But because of longstanding disagreements over trade, EU and Chinese leaders killed a joint declaration on countering climate change, not presenting a strongly united front against Mr. Trump\u2019s stance.Now, EU governments and the European Parliament are debating bills that lay out how the bloc will cut emissions from buildings, agriculture, waste management, transport and the use of soil. They are also deliberating how to account for forests, and timber use for fuel. Brussels\u2019 goal is to reduce releases across all those areas by 30% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels.\u201cWe have to be able to show that we can rise to the challenge,\u201d Luxembourg Environment Minister       Carole Dieschbourg       said, calling the lack of consensus \u201cregrettable.\u201dThe EU ministers\u2019 next formal meeting is in October.

He brought home an upbeat message on the progress of a U.S.-China 100-day plan to reduce trade friction.The security dialogue that is opening with a high-level meeting in Washington on Wednesday was proposed by Presidents       Donald Trump       and       Xi Jinping       earlier this year. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson,        who will run Wednesday\u2019s one-day meeting alongside Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi, has said the U.S. intends to focus on limiting North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.Washington and Beijing have hit an impasse over North Korea, which has pushed forward with its nuclear-weapons and missile program despite U.N. sanctions. Chinese officials say they are doing everything they can under existing sanctions to pressure Pyongyang. U.S. officials say China, as North Korea\u2019s lone major ally, can do more.Trade, by contrast, has seen some progress. Aside from the beef deal, China also approved the import of two new varieties of genetically modified crops, expanding the market for U.S. agricultural companies.In addition, several Chinese companies, including e-commerce giant             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.      , have pledged investment they say will bring new jobs to U.S. workers. Alibaba founder       Jack Ma       said in January that he would use his company\u2019s platform to help small and medium-size American companies gain access to the Chinese market, pledging to create one million jobs in the process.Mr. Ma plans to try to sell that vision at a conference in Detroit this week. The billionaire\u2019s keynote speech is scheduled to coincide with Wednesday\u2019s meeting in Washington.\u201cI think he will be successful. I hope he\u2019s successful, because it\u2019s in the interests of both sides,\u201d said Mr. Wei, who is now a senior figure at a state-supported think tank. He predicted Alibaba would help promote development of the U.S. logistics industry in addition to adding jobs in retail.Officials who traveled with Mr. Wei had positive words for Mr. Trump, who had threatened a trade war with China over its currency and other issues.\u201cHis attitudes on China have changed a lot,\u201d said       Zhao Qizheng,        former head of the information office of China\u2019s State Council, speaking at a press briefing with Mr. Wei and other officials.For China, challenges to the trade relationship remain, Mr. Wei said. He pointed to U.S. rules barring the export to China of high-tech products with potential military applications, and U.S. security reviews that have restricted Chinese investment in sensitive U.S. industries.He also acknowledged frustrations among U.S. companies with China\u2019s own foreign-investment restrictions in certain areas. Foreign trade groups have complained about obstacles to entry in information technology, finance and other sectors.Mr. Wei said he saw no risk of a U.S.-China trade war in the coming year.

GM 0.11%       will eliminate a shift at a sedan plant in Kansas City, Kan., laying off about 1,000 people as the nation\u2019s largest auto maker continues to shed thousands of factory jobs amid a sharp downturn in demand for passenger cars.GM\u00a0on Friday\u00a0notified workers that the factory\u2019s third shift will be eliminated in late September, the company confirmed in a statement\u00a0Monday. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that GM was extending the plant\u2019s traditional summer shutdown and that permanent job cuts were likely.\u201cLower demand for passenger cars across the industry has caused us to adjust production of some models,\u201d GM said in a statement. The company said it is launching a \u201crecord number\u201d of crossover SUVs to retain customers who are defecting from sedans.The Kansas City factory makes just one model, the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan, a market segment that is shrinking rapidly as consumers flock to crossovers amid tame gas prices and many new entries from auto makers. Malibu sales fell 30% this year through May, while midsize cars over all were down 14%, according to Autodata Corp.The auto giant\u2019s sales are off 1.1% in the U.S. through five months compared with the same period in 2016. Its performance is slightly better than the industry\u2019s overall decline of 2% over the same span.GM over the past seven months has announced plans for more than 5,000 layoffs across a half-dozen U.S. factories \u00a0in response to slow passenger-car demand. A GM spokesman said the actual number of workers out of a job is smaller because some have been able to transfer to other GM factories, though he couldn\u2019t cite a specific number.Meanwhile, GM is in growth mode at factories that make pickup trucks and SUVs. Last week the auto maker said it would open a large supplier park near its plant in Arlington, Texas, to support its next generation of large SUVs. Employees at GM\u2019s three U.S. pickup-truck factories also are working around the clock.GM executives have said the company will adjust production schedules to avoid overproducing vehicles, a practice that helped nudge the auto maker into bankruptcy in 2009.

A single power plant could have one or several units.Many of these plants were built near the source in Appalachia and western states. But generators built in far-away places like New England have also turned off.The shutdowns can cost communities both high-paying jobs and important sources of tax revenue. Natural-gas-fired plants have quickly mushroomed up across the U.S. to replace the retiring coal generators, but those plants need far fewer workers\u2014one for every five that worked at a coal plant, by some estimates.A 54-year-old coal-fired plant here stopped operating three weeks ago, and local officials started raising property taxes several years back to compensate for lower revenue from the town\u2019s largest taxpayer as production slowed.In Adams County, Ohio, where Dayton Power & Light has said it will shut two coal-fired plants, county auditor David Gifford sees a host of knock-on effects including layoffs for public employees, program cuts for seniors, libraries and schools, as well as a steep hike in property taxes. The plants contributed more than 30% of the county\u2019s $27 million in total tax revenue.\u201cIf the power company shuts their doors, then John Doe on the street is going to have to pay for it,\u201d Mr. Gifford said.A DP&L spokeswoman said the company decided the plants wouldn\u2019t be economically viable beyond mid-2018, and \u201cwe faced an important and difficult outcome.\u201dIt is a scenario being played out elsewhere as more coal-fired power plants retire, squeezed out in part by new, cheaper-to-run natural gas-fired plants.Two entire plants in New Jersey also closed in June, and more coal units are scheduled to close in places like Tennessee and Michigan. Carbon County, Utah, is still smarting from the loss of a small coal-fired plant two years ago, said Seth Oveson, the county clerk and auditor.Cassville, Wis., lost 55% of its tax revenue when two former coal plants on either side of town, including one that was converted to burning biomass, shut within four months of each other in 2015, said Keevin Williams, president of the village of 950 people.Mr. Williams himself worked at one plant for 31 years before retiring. Others moved away to find work. The village on the Mississippi River has cut staff and put off projects, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re a small community. When you lose 90 jobs, that\u2019s 10% of your population,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s made things very tough.\u201dLast year, natural gas surpassed coal for the first time in U.S. electricity generation, providing 34% of the nation\u2019s power, versus 30% for coal, according to the EIA. As recently as 2011, coal provided roughly 43% of generation.The reduction in coal-fired power underscores the challenge for President       Donald Trump       in fulfilling his promise to aid a flagging coal-mining industry because power plants are by far the main consumers of American coal.Mr. Trump\u2019s moves to undo environmental regulations, and the recent withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, are unlikely to reverse the closure of coal-fired plants, according to Adele Morris, policy director for the Climate and Energy Economics Project at the Brookings Institution. Ms. Morris said their closure is driven mainly by cheap gas and a federal rule limiting mercury and other pollutants.\u201cThere\u2019s an increasing awareness that coal will not return to its former glory,\u201d said       Charles Patton,        head of external affairs at             American Electric Power Co.      , a Columbus, Ohio, utility that has shut nine coal-fired power plants since 2011.Neither the EIA nor the Bureau of Labor Statistics track how this shift has affected coal-fired-plant workers. Coal-fired plants require more staff than typically newer and simpler gas-fired units, according to workers and utilities. A spokesman for the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has also been retiring coal units, said a coal plant could employ roughly 150 to 250 while a new gas plant might need 35 workers.In Ohio\u2019s Adams County, where 25% of the 28,000 residents live below the poverty line, the prospect of losing the two plants is devastating.Mr. Gifford, the auditor for the county, said that if the power plants close, the county could be forced to raise the property-tax rate at least 500% in order to maintain school-district debt payments.Joel Hanson, a veteran at one plant, said he had thought he would be able to work through to retirement at the power plant. Now he may uproot his wife and two young children from the nearby town of Manchester. \u201cIt\u2019s like having the rug pulled out from under you,\u201d Mr. Hanson, 43, said. The Utility Workers Union of America, which represents workers at the plants, is trying to find investors to buy them, according to the union.In Somerset, Brayton Point was the last coal-fired power plant in Massachusetts, and one of just four left in New England. Prior plant owner Energy Capital Partners decided in 2014 to shut the plant due to competition from cheap gas, and current owner             Dynegy Inc.       followed through.The plant paid more than $13 million in taxes as recently as five years ago, but payments have declined alongside power production since then, and the town of about 18,000 people has had to shift the burden to other taxpayers, town Finance Director Joe Bolton said. Somerset already lost a smaller coal-fired plant in 2010.Electrician David Kutz, a 32-year Brayton Point veteran and area homeowner, will receive severance, but said he plans to find new work to help cover medical insurance.\u201cThis plant put so many kids through college, bought so many houses, paid so many taxes,\u201d said Mr. Kutz, who is 59 years old. \u201cIt\u2019s hard now seeing people go.\u201dWrite to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.com and Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 13:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/coals-decline-spreads-far-beyond-appalachia-1497870003", "news_title": "Coal\u2019s Decline Spreads Far Beyond Appalachia", "keywords": "capacity,facilities,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,facility closures,lay-offs,redundancies,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,energy,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,fossil fuel power generation,electric utilities,utilities"}, {"content": "American homes are brimming with products made in China. This week, Alibaba Group Holding chairman Jack Ma will put on a show to help U.S. entrepreneurs flip the script.In a two-day event starting Tuesday in Detroit, the e-commerce giant will offer an expected 3,000 U.S. small-business owners tips on how to market and ship their wares to Chinese consumers. There is also a \u201cfireside chat\u201d with Martha Stewart, and Mr. Ma will be interviewed by TV news personality Charlie Rose.The event, to be held at Detroit\u2019s Cobo Center, is being staged partly to show that Mr. Ma is making good on his pledge to President Donald Trump to help create one million new American jobs. But Alibaba, which is credited with starting China\u2019s online shopping binge, could use some new Western goods to sell, analysts say.Chinese rival JD.com Inc. said Monday that it generated $17.7 billion in sales during its 18-day \u201c6.18\u201d sales event in China this month, buoyed by tie-ups with U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Chinese social-media giant Tencent Holdings. Niche e-commerce providers are also starting to lure buyers away from the big sites.\u201cExpanding U.S. connections will help Alibaba attract more merchants and more products to its platform,\u201d said       Tian Hou,        founder of equity research firm TH Capital in Beijing.Alibaba President Michael Evans said China\u2019s swelling ranks of middle-class consumers are looking for U.S. brands, \u201cwhich the consumers in China find enormously appealing.\u201dStill, merchants and industry consultants say Mr. Ma has work to do.One continuing issue is the presence of counterfeits on Alibaba\u2019s Taobao site, which features products primarily sold by small businesses and consumers. Its other shopping site, Tmall, is used by brands themselves.The U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s Office reinstated Taobao on a list of \u201cnotorious\u201d marketplaces for fakes last year, citing \u201cthe challenges right holders experience in removing and preventing illicit sales and offers of such goods.\u201dCyndi Zlotow has been selling women\u2019s and men\u2019s fashion on             eBay Inc.       for 15 years. She says she will continue to sell there, and on Amazon.com, partly out of fear that if she sells on other channels, knockoffs will quickly show up and undercut her on price.\u201cIf Alibaba was this great marketplace where I could sell my products at the prices I need to be at, yeah, I would sell on it,\u201d said Ms. Zlotow, who lives in the Chicago area. \u201cBut we can\u2019t sell against the fake products, and the price still matters. Even in middle-class China.\u201dAlibaba executives say they have worked tirelessly to police their site, and Mr. Evans said Alibaba will have experts on hand in Detroit to help merchants learn how to protect their goods from counterfeiters.Even without the threat of fake goods, however, China has emerged as an online retailing behemoth. China will post an estimated $771 billion in annual online retail sales this year, compared with $446 billion in the U.S.\u201cU.S. brands aren\u2019t blind to the fact that China has surpassed the U.S. to become the largest e-commerce marketplace globally,\u201d said Lily Varon, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based analyst with Forrester, adding that they are also familiar with stories of brands that have tried and failed to crack China.Some question whether Mr. Ma\u2019s initiative, should it succeed, actually would create new jobs since the sellers are already marketing their products on Amazon.com and eBay.com.Selling on Alibaba \u201cwill merely extend the range of what sellers are doing,\u201d said Ben Cavender, an analyst at China Market Research Group in Shanghai. \u201cRealistically this is not going to result in a lot of job creation as most of the increased labor needs are going into logistics or manufacturing\u2014that are already highly automated.\u201dAlibaba can\u2019t hope to put all those concerns to rest in a two-day conference, said Duncan Clark, author of the book \u201cAlibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built.\u201d Its goals are likely more modest, he said.\u201cThe U.S. impression of China is more like China equals cheap, not yet China as a destination market so much,\u201d said Beijing-based Mr. Clark. \u201cThat is what Alibaba is attempting to change. To change perceptions of China as a consumer, not just a producer.\u201dJanice Ungar, a Detroit-area seller of European and American puzzles on Amazon and eBay, says she is eager to hear what Mr. Ma and company have to say. Despite her concerns about potentially competing against fakes, she has signed up to attend Gateway 17.\u201cI\u2019m always looking for the next angle, the next place to sell,\u201d said Ms. Ungar. \u201cIf I can tap the Chinese market, it\u2019s a win-win.\u201dAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Alibaba\u2019s Ma to Offer Tips to U.S. Merchants.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 13:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibabas-jack-ma-heads-to-detroit-to-impress-entrepreneursand-trump-1497894811", "news_title": "Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma Heads to Detroit to Impress Entrepreneurs\u2014and Trump ", "keywords": "alibaba,alibaba counterfeit,china e-commerce,jack ma,jack ma jobs pledge,jobs creation,trump jack ma,Alibaba Group,BABA,JD.com,JD,Wal-Mart Stores,WMT,Alibaba Group Holding,Tencent Holdings,HK:0700,Amazon.com,AMZN,eBay.com,Jack Ma,Martha Stewart,Charlie Rose,Donald Trump,Michael Evans,Cyndi Zlotow,Lily Varon,Ben Cavender,Duncan Clark,Janice Ungar,corporate,industrial news,entrepreneurs,printing,publishing,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,etailing,shopping malls,superstores,legal services,business,consumer services,e-commerce,internet,online,media,entertainment,technology"}, {"content": "Fox Networks Group is preparing a new six-second ad format for digital platforms and eventually traditional TV, mirroring an ad format recently adopted by Google\u2019s YouTube, the company said.TV ads are typically longer than 15 seconds, but as viewing shifts online, where people are skipping or blocking ads, advertisers and media companies have experimented with new ad formats and strategies.\u201cWe\u2019re getting to a place where there\u2019s just too much noise and people are seeking environments where there is a lot less clutter,\u201d said       David Levy,        executive vice president of nonlinear revenue at Fox Networks Group. \u201cHow do we get more efficient with consumers\u2019 time and attention? Everything you see us invest in has that as a backdrop and premise.\u201dThe ad format should be ready by October for shows and content viewed through digital and on-demand platforms, said Mr. Levy. For example, he envisions the format working well for a \u201cpre-roll\u201d ad that appears before long-form episodes viewed on-demand, or premium sports content that could have more of a \u201cviral effect\u201d with a shorter ad intro.After a few months of testing, Fox could start selling the six-second inventory to traditional TV advertisers, he said.Fox, among other media companies, has experimented with formats that encourage a consumer to interact with an ad, and has tried reducing the number of ads it sells per show. For example, FX has reduced commercial time from the previous year by 75%, said Mr. Levy. Networks have also invested in technology and data that offers advertisers more precise audience targeting across TV and digital platforms.The company, through its ad studio, will likely help advertisers create content in the new format, as it does for its interactive ads. About 85% of the Fox\u2019s interactive ads are produced by its studio, while 15% are produced by agencies and advertisers, said Mr. Levy. Fox said it\u2019s currently working through the pricing for the shorter ad format.While he\u2019s expecting advertisers to embrace the shorter ads, given consumers\u2019 growing frustration with interruptions, Mr. Levy doesn\u2019t expect six-second ads to replace longer, 15- or 30-second ads common in TV.\u201cThe best marketing we\u2019ve seen, and we now are able to measure, is when we\u2019re delivering multiple ad formats with different time lengths,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest thing will be making sure that we understand, and advertisers understand, the true value of what this kind of ad format can deliver.\u201dFox Networks Group includes the Fox broadcast network, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Cable Networks, among other groups.21st Century Fox,        FOX 0.96%       parent of the Fox Networks Group, shares common ownership with Wall Street Journal-owner             News Corp.Write to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 13:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fox-to-launch-new-six-second-ad-format-for-digital-content-and-tv-1497894316", "news_title": "Fox to Launch New Six-Second Ad Format for Digital Content and TV ", "keywords": "cannescmo,fox,21st Century Fox,FOX,FOXA,Fox Networks Group,new products,services,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,network television (discontinued from 11th july 2017),television,radio,film production,cinema film production,broadcasting,television broadcasting,media"}, {"content": "NBC News anchor       Megyn Kelly\u2019s       Sunday evening interview with controversial radio personality and Infowars founder       Alex Jones       drew 3.5 million viewers, according to preliminary Nielsen ratings, falling short of the hype over the broadcast in the preceding days.Despite facing off against reruns of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on             CBS                   and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Funniest Home Videos\u201d on ABC in the 7 p.m hour, \u201cSunday Night with Megyn Kelly\u201d finished fourth in total viewers and narrowly scraped out a third-place finish in the demographic of adults aged 25 to 54 that news programs target. Fox\u2019s coverage of golf\u2019s U.S. Open won the 7 p.m. hour in viewers and demographics.In the three weeks since Ms. Kelly\u2019s new Sunday news magazine premiered, ratings have steadily declined. In week one, which included an interview with Russian President       Vladimir Putin,        the show attracted 6.2 million viewers. Last week\u2019s broadcast featuring an interview with sports reporter       Erin Andrews       averaged 3.6 million viewers.The show is launching in June, when TV audiences typically begin to drop somewhat, but the week-to-week declines are notable. NBC News earlier this year hired Ms. Kelly away from Fox News, where she had become a star. In addition to the Sunday night program, she will also host a daily morning show starting in the fall.NBC said in a statement that \u201cSunday Night with Megyn Kelly\u201d did beat \u201c60 Minutes\u201d among adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54. Both wins were by fewer than 50,000 viewers and it was a new episode versus a rerun.The Alex Jones interview had turned into a public-relations nightmare for Ms. Kelly and NBC News. The network and Ms. Kelly were criticized for giving a platform to Mr. Jones, who has questioned whether the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax and has called the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks a government conspiracy.Some families who lost children in the Sandy Hook shooting publicly chastised the network. The show also scared off some advertisers.NBC News ended up tweaking the story and including a Sandy Hook family member in its profile.       Tom Brokaw,        the former NBC News anchor and the network\u2019s last link to the golden age of broadcast news, also read an essay on Sunday\u2019s show saying, \u201cwe cannot allow the agents of hate to go unchallenged and become the imprint of our time.\u201dMedia critics mostly gave Ms. Kelly positive marks for the interview, although the Los Angeles Times said, \u201cinstead of exposing Jones, the Sunday show afforded a puff piece to the dangerous propagandist.\u201dWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 13:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/megyn-kellys-interview-with-alex-jones-attracts-3-5-million-viewers-1497894023", "news_title": "Megyn Kelly\u2019s Interview With Alex Jones Attracts 3.5 Million Viewers ", "keywords": "nbc news,nielsen ratings,Megyn Kelly,marketing,markets,market share,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,television,radio,interviews,broadcasting,television broadcasting,media"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014A car rammed into a police van before bursting into flames on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es Monday afternoon, in an assault authorities are investigating as a possible terror attack.The driver died at the scene, but no one else was injured, said police.Fire arms and explosive materials were found in the car, French Interior Minister       G\u00e9rard Collomb       said, without disclosing further details.\u201cThis shows that the terror threat remains extremely high in the country,\u201d Mr. Collomb said speaking on national TV.Prosecutors have opened a terror probe into the attack, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said Monday.A string of attacks\u2014including the Nov. 13, 2015, assault by Islamic State militants that killed 130 in Paris and the truck attack in Nice that killed 86 people on Bastille Day last July\u2014has put France on edge.

It was bold of Boston to deal the top pick to a team in its own division. Whether it was also brilliant depends on how good that pick turns out to be.That pick almost certainly will be Fultz, the University of Washington guard whose shooting makes him the perfect complement for Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. Philly is betting that Fultz is a transformational star at the league\u2019s most important position. Former general manager Sam Hinkie isn\u2019t around to reap the rewards of his strategy, but this was exactly the plan behind the Sixers\u2019 process: to have the resources to acquire a potentially generational talent when the time was right.The optimistic Philly fan sees Fultz, Embiid and Simmons as the promising core of an exciting team that can make the playoffs as soon as next season and maybe even compete for titles before anyone reasonably expected. The result of four years of tanking could be a decade of success. Or, as Embiid wrote underneath an Instagram photo over the weekend, \u201cthis should be legendary if it happens.\u201dBut that\u2019s a big if. Before the legendary dynasty begins, the Sixers\u2019 young players actually have to play, which has been surprisingly problematic. Embiid has played only 31 games since being drafted in 2014, due to foot and knee injuries. Simmons, the top pick last year, still hasn\u2019t played because of his own foot injuries. Fultz obviously hasn\u2019t played, either, and the Celtics just decided they didn\u2019t want him.Boston\u2019s risky move here is even more intriguing than Philly\u2019s. It\u2019s unusual for a team to deal the No. 1 pick before the draft. It\u2019s even more unusual for a team that deals the No. 1 pick not to get an established star in return.What the Celtics got instead was flexibility. By moving back two spots\u2014likely because they wanted someone other than Fultz or Lonzo Ball who could be available at No. 3 anyway\u2014Boston added what it called \u201cthe favorably protected rights to a future first-round pick.\u201d For those who don\u2019t speak NBA, that means one more high lottery pick in another draft. They\u2019ve become a good team with the assets of a bad team.Next year\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers pick gets sent to Boston if that selection is No. 2 through No. 5, and the odds of that happening could be as high as 80% if the Lakers lose as much as most people expect. Boston still has the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 pick next year, too, as the result of a 2014 trade that turned out to be the most lopsided deal in NBA history. Which means the Celtics could have the No. 1 and No. 2 picks in 2018. But it might be preferable if they don\u2019t get that Lakers pick. Boston would then get the higher pick of the Sixers or Sacramento Kings\u2019 in 2019 as long as it\u2019s not the top pick. It doesn\u2019t seem likely the Kings will be any better by then.Here\u2019s the upshot: Boston has shorted the Nets, Lakers and Kings. The Celtics win if those teams lose.They have gambled against three of the NBA\u2019s worst teams at a time when the Celtics are one of the NBA\u2019s best teams. They had the top record in the Eastern Conference this season and should be even better next season, especially if they land a big fish in free agency. They\u2019re the rare NBA team built for the present and the future.That\u2019s what makes this weekend\u2019s blockbuster deal so uncertain. The Celtics\u2019 stiffest competition for years to come\u2014especially if LeBron James ever gets worse at basketball\u2014could be the Sixers, the team they helped create. They\u2019re now linked with the player they\u2019re not drafting.

Less foreseen was the degree to which Beijing\u2019s\u00a0investment in poorer parts of Europe appears to have bought silence on China\u2019s human-rights record, according to analysts, diplomats and human-rights organizations.On Thursday, Greece was\u00a0alone\u00a0among the 28 EU members in objecting\u00a0to criticism of China by the bloc, which sought to challenge Beijing\u2019s crackdown on political activists and dissidents.\u201cGreece\u2019s position is that unproductive and in many cases selective criticism against specific countries doesn\u2019t facilitate the promotion of human rights in these states, nor the development of their relation with the EU,\u201d a Greek foreign ministry official said.EU officials played down the rift.\u201cThe global human-rights agenda is best served when the EU speaks with one voice,\u201d said a spokeswoman for\u00a0EU Foreign Affairs\u00a0chief       Federica Mogherini.      \u00a0\u201cWe will continue our work to bring all 28 together.\u201dChina has helped fund major infrastructure projects in Europe\u2019s south and east, offering billions of euros in finance for railways, power lines, roads and bridges across such economically squeezed countries as Greece, Hungary, Croatia and Portugal.\u2018Those countries are in a weak situation economically and they want those investments.\u2019For Greece, under pressure from its international creditors to slash public spending, Chinese cash has been vital. It helped refurbish Greece\u2019s largest port and propped up its wheezing state-owned power-grid operator.China\u2019s investment has bought influence in Athens, human-rights groups said after Greece told fellow EU members it was uneasy about criticism of China\u2019s human-rights record before blocking the statement\u00a0on Thursday.Chinese President       Xi Jinping       has called Greece China\u2019s \u201cmost reliable friend in the EU.\u201d Hungary and Croatia have also blocked EU statements chastising Beijing.\u00a0The three countries last year repeatedly thwarted a statement from the 28 member states taking issue with China\u2019s aggressive stance in the South China Sea.\u201cThose countries are in a weak situation economically and they want those investments,\u201d said       Nad\u00e8ge Rolland,        a senior China analyst at the National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington.\u2018We oppose politicizing the human-rights issue\u2019Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman       Geng Shuang       said while Beijing didn\u2019t know specifics of internal EU discussions on the issue, China wanted to commend \u201cthe relevant country\u201d for taking the right position on the matter.\u201cWe oppose politicizing the human-rights issue\u201d and using it to interfere with countries\u2019 sovereignty, Mr. Geng said.Greek officials have acknowledged\u00a0Europe\u2019s\u00a0concerns about the political and economic effects of Chinese investment.Chinese officials say they use infrastructure loans\u2014particularly for transport projects\u2014to buy diplomatic influence in Europe, a strategy dubbed \u201chigh-speed rail diplomacy\u201d by one\u00a0Chinese government-backed university.China\u2019s European investments mirror the country\u2019s moves in Asia, where it is building roads, railways and power plants as part of its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative\u201d to link Europe and Central Asia to China.High-speed rail investment has been a key part of China\u2019s push to gain diplomatic leverage in parts of Europe. Beijing in 2013 said it would finance 85% of a $2-billion project to build a high-speed railway between the capitals of Serbia and Hungary.Hungarian politicians have lauded Chinese investment and moved to shield China from criticism. Prime Minister       Viktor Orban       said in Beijing last month that developed countries lecturing on human rights has become \u201cincreasingly offensive.\u201dChina has also lent money for the construction of a bridge in Serbia, a power station in Bosnia and new roads in Macedonia. Further west,\u00a0Portugal and Spain have\u00a0received Chinese investment in energy-production networks.China has been one of\u00a0the few investors debt-laden Greece\u00a0has attracted\u00a0in recent years. Greece\u2019s left-wing Prime Minister       Alexis Tsipras       has visited China twice\u2014most recently last month\u2014during the last two years in an effort to lure investors to his economically struggling country.During his last trip, Greek telecommunications company         Forthnet               and Chinese telecom equipment maker         ZTE Corp       teamed up with two other Chinese firms to finance a fiber-optic network in Greece in a \u20ac500-million ($560-million) investment. China\u2019s state coal producer         Shenhua Corp.       teamed up with Greece\u2019s Copelouzos Group on green energy projects in an investment valued at \u20ac3 billion, with many more promised to follow.China says its investment promotes EU integration by addressing the uneven development among the bloc\u2019s member states. But European policy makers worry Beijing\u2019s investments also work to lure financially stressed eurozone countries into its sphere of influence.\u201cIf every single government enters a dog race over attracting more Chinese investment than their next-door neighbors, then that\u2019s inviting a divide-and-conquer approach,\u201d said       Reinhard B\u00fctikofer,        a member of the European Parliament and co-chair of the European Green Party.\u2014Josh Chin and Brian Spegele in Beijing contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'China\u2019s Cash Blunts Europe\u2019s Criticism.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 13:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-cash-blunts-europes-criticism-of-beijings-human-rights-record-1497892018", "news_title": "Chinese Cash Blunts Europe\u2019s Criticism of Beijing\u2019s Human-Rights Record ", "keywords": " china european investment,china human rights, china investment, eu china policy, piraeus ,European Union,Greek foreign ministry,Forthnet S.A.,GR:FORTH,ZTE,ZTCOY,China Shenhua Energy,CUAEF,Copelouzos Group,political,general news,society,community,international relations,human rights,civil liberties,politics,transport,heavy construction,railway construction,construction,real estate"}, {"content": "There are two things investors should keep in mind about the Federal Reserve: One, it is in a tightening cycle. Two, tightening cycles almost always end badly.The Fed raised rates for a third time in six months last week, and signaled there are more to come. After all the fits and starts of the past several years, the Fed is finally, unambiguously in a tightening cycle -- a fact underscored by its plans to start reducing the amount of bonds it holds on its balance sheet, a legacy of its efforts to restart the economy after the financial crisis \u201crelatively soon,\u201d according to Chairwoman Janet Yellen.The Fed\u2019s aim here is to guide the economy to a soft landing. To do that, it foresees continuing to raise rates in order to slow growth, ease the pace of hiring, and nudge the unemployment rate little higher. That way, it reckons it will be able to prevent the job market from overheating while getting the inflation rate to settle at 2%.But executing a soft landing is notoriously difficult to pull off. The Fed can only guess at what the economy\u2019s just-right levels of growth and employment are, and at what level of interest rates is consistent with hitting those marks. The process of running down its balance sheet introduces new complications, points out J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli, as does a likely change in leadership at the Fed.Moreover, the Fed\u2019s track record with soft landings is incredibly poor. It has had, with the benefit of hindsight, a tendency to overtighten in its efforts to tame inflation and other excesses. Rates suddenly go from looking as if they are too low to too high, and the economy suffers as a result.By the time it stopped raising rates in 2006, for example, the housing bust that would drag the economy into recession and set off the financial crisis was under way.The only time the Fed really succeeded in executing a soft landing, according to most economists, was when it raised rates through 1994. In the mid-1960s and mid-1980s it had a couple of qualified successes. Its other tightening cycles over the past 60 years were followed by recessions, though in some cases a recession was necessary to wipe out inflation.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.A recession seems far from imminent at the moment. Hiring appears to have slowed, but is still running fast to keep the unemployment rate slipping lower. Inflation has been stubbornly low, allowing the Fed to raise rates slowly, which might prevent the bank from tightening too much. And while stock valuations are running high, the types of financial market excess that got the economy in trouble during the dot-com and housing bubbles haven\u2019t presented themselves.Still, with the Fed trying to pull off a maneuver it has had little success with, investors should pay attention.

In all, NATO has positioned some 4,500 troops in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland.Allied and Russian forces have both been building up in the Baltic region. The deployments have raised the risk of miscalculation, some analysts said, but both sides have said they are necessary defensive initiatives.The U.S. has deployed a tank brigade to Central and Eastern Europe and is conducting exercises in the Baltic Sea region. This month, the U.S. flew B-2 stealth bombers to Europe for what American military officials called a demonstration of reassurance for allies. The U.S. has also deployed other bombers and Army units for exercises in the Baltic Sea area.Russia, too, is enlarging its forces. It is creating a larger permanent military presence in the region, including missiles and new army units, moves it says counter the NATO deployments. Russia and Belarus are also preparing for a large military exercise in September.NATO Secretary-General       Jens Stoltenberg       said he didn\u2019t see any \u201cimminent threat\u201d to NATO forces or the Baltic states. He also said he hoped to convene a meeting between NATO ambassadors and their Russian counterpart so the two sides could brief each other on coming exercises.\u201cWe see increased military presence in this region,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said in an interview. \u201cThe increased military presence underlines the importance of transparency, predictability. and risk reduction.\u201dRussia has said the NATO deployment violates an agreement with Moscow not to permanently station significant combat forces on Russia\u2019s borders.Russian officials have consistently said the NATO force is undermining, not improving, security.       Alexander Grushko,        the Russian ambassador to NATO, recently said the alliance should focus on fighting terrorism, not defending against Moscow.Mr. Grushko also said NATO\u2019s buildup risked an arms race. \u201cThe situation is dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know from our previous experience when there is a military dynamic\u2026it will reproduce the logic of having additional assets, additional assets, additional assets.\u201dMr. Stoltenberg said the alliance hadn\u2019t violated agreements with Russia. Canadian Defense Minister       Harjit Sajjan      \u00a0said the NATO arrangements were clearly defensive. He said it was Russia that had committed aggression by annexing Crimea, prompting Canada to deploy its largest force to Europe since the Cold War.\u201cYou really have to ask Russia that question: Who is the aggressor here,\u201d Mr. Sajjan said in an interview. \u201cWe, with NATO, are sending an important message for our alliance, we stand together.\u2026This is not an aggressive message.\u201dIn recent months, the alliance has had to deal with political sensitivities as U.S. President       Donald Trump       has said European powers don\u2019t spend enough on their militaries, and questions have been raised about whether the U.S. would live up to its commitment to defend allies.Mr. Trump said in May that current spending was inadequate and raised the prospect of increasing the NATO target from 2% of economic output to 3%, allied officials said.With most allies spending well below 2%, there is little appetite to raise the target, they said. Mr. Stoltenberg said he has urged countries to abide by the 2014 Wales pledge to move toward spending 2%.\u201cI know that President Trump has recognized the progress we see across Europe and Canada,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said. \u201cHe has actually said the money is pouring in.\u201dWrite to Julian E.

It isn\u2019t working, at least when it comes to the world\u2019s second-biggest equity market, China.MSCI will decide on Tuesday whether to include Chinese domestic stocks in the benchmark emerging markets index, a decision that could lead to hundreds of billions of dollars eventually being invested there.It might seem obvious that the $7.8 trillion of A shares in China ought to be in the benchmark, given they make up more than 10% of the value of the world\u2019s stocks and more than 60% of the value of emerging markets.The difficulty of the decision is due to the conflicting nature of modern indexes as both measures of performance and the basis for investment. A measure of stock prices that excludes China is obviously flawed. Yet, tracking an index that includes China exposes investors to strict capital controls and arbitrary suspensions.Investors in mutual- and exchange-traded funds tracking indexes often think they\u2019re making a simple decision to follow what the market\u2019s doing. In reality the indexes have mutated from measures of the market into primitive investing algorithms, with sometimes odd effects.Consider the latest plan by MSCI for China, watered down to cater to the needs of index trackers. China\u2019s $7.8 trillion domestically listed A shares are bigger than London and Frankfurt combined. But MSCI has suggested adding only 169 of China\u2019s 3,261 A shares, giving them a weight of just 0.5% of the EM index, in line with the ability of investors to get money in and out of China via Hong Kong\u2019s Stock Connect mechanism.For an investing algo, this makes perfect sense. Computer-driven investing has to follow rules, and has to have some chance of being able to follow the rules. If it is difficult to invest more in China, there is no point in giving China a higher weight, however big the Chinese market may be.However, the result is that the supposed benchmark is neither a sensible measure of what\u2019s happening in emerging markets, because China\u2019s weight is too small, nor a useful tool for big investors who have secured preferential access to the market.Other algos can follow different rules. Vanguard runs $70 billion in the biggest EM ETF following a FTSE index that includes almost 5% in Chinese A shares, 10 times what MSCI is proposing, based on quotas allocated to large foreign investors. They may be simpler than the usual computer-driven trader, but the big decisions still matter: Vanguard\u2019s EM ETF is up 14.1% this year against 17.7% for Blackrock\u2019s iShares MSCI-driven ETF because of weak A-share performance and MSCI\u2019s inclusion of star performer South Korea in EM. Active fund managers often have narrower gaps in performance.The index\u2019s role as an investment tool means something ostensibly designed as a measure can end up with a big influence on the market itself. Goldman Sachs analysts think including China could prompt $210 billion of index money to flow into the country in the next five years, as MSCI increases China\u2019s weighting. Such big money flows can lead to strange price outcomes, as Pakistan experienced last month. Its promotion to the EM index led shares to soar, then plummet, as traders bought stocks in the hope of selling them on to index funds forced to buy at any price.The same conflict between measurement and investing is at work in corporate governance. When measuring stock performance, it doesn\u2019t really matter how a company is run. But investors\u2014rightly\u2014care a lot. MSCI is consulting index users on whether to exclude companies such as             Snap Inc.,        SNAP 1.63%       owner of Snapchat, that issue nonvoting shares. The FTSE 100, the British benchmark, goes much further, only including London-listed companies incorporated elsewhere if they meet a range of different standards.In theory, index investing has three big advantages. It is cheap, it takes away the need to assess the skills of active managers, and it is simple, just buying everything in proportion to its value.In practice index investing is indeed very cheap, with the             iShares Core S&P 500 ETF                   charging only 0.04% a year. But the plethora of options mean investors now need to assess the skills of index designers, while increasingly complex rules take most indexes well away from a simple weighting by market capitalization.Investors who just want to buy the entire market, or try to measure what\u2019s going on with stocks, shouldn\u2019t be fooled into thinking these index algos are truly passive.Write to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Your ETF Isn\u2019t What You Might Think It Is.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 12:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-etf-isnt-what-you-think-it-is-1497889558", "news_title": "Your ETF Isn\u2019t What You Think It Is ", "keywords": " algo, chinese stocks,etf, exchange traded funds, msci emerging markets,Snap,SNAP,MSCI,BlackRock,BLK,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,retail,wholesale,motor vehicle dealing,specialty stores,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,exchange traded funds,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "HoustonFor the first five years of general manager Jeff Luhnow\u2019s tenure, the Houston Astros did one thing better than all of their peers: fail to make contact with the ball.From 2012 through 2016, the Astros whiffed nearly 400 times more than their closest rival, appearing to epitomize the growing view that strikeouts are a necessary concession in the pursuit of power production.But even as the once-embarrassing punch-out lost its stigma, the constant stream of hitters slinking back to the dugout bothered Luhnow, the architect of perhaps the sport\u2019s most data-driven organization.\u201cI saw firsthand the second-order effect of the high-strikeout world, which is the killing [of] the rallies, the not being able to produce those extra runs from guys getting on base,\u201d Luhnow said in a recent interview at Minute Maid Park. \u201cWe hit a lot home runs, but it didn\u2019t necessarily help us win that many more ballgames.\u201dSo this winter, Luhnow fought back, and the numbers speak for themselves. More than 40% of the way through the season, the Astros own the best record in the majors, blitzing the competition with a lineup that defies all logic.They still hit homers\u2014boatloads of them, entering Monday\u2019s action just one behind the New York Yankees for the league lead. But even when they don\u2019t, they put the ball in play at a rate practically unheard of for a group with so much thump, striking out in just 17.7% of their plate appearances, a MLB low.If they continue their pace, the Astros could join the 1995 American League-champion Cleveland Indians as the only teams since 1913 to rank first in the majors in home runs and last in strikeouts.\u201cWe do prefer a model where contact is made,\u201d Luhnow said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the results of that.\u201dLuhnow isn\u2019t asserting that the Astros have discovered a secret formula to mashing home runs without a hefty helping of strikeouts. But he did seek to build a roster with more emphasis on contact this off-season. He acquired Nori Aoki, Josh Reddick and Carlos Beltran\u2014three players with lifetime strikeout rates under 17%, far below the league average of 21.5%.That trio complements an offensive unit loaded with young talent, from established stars Carlos Correa, to burgeoning ones like George Springer and Alex Bregman. All three of those players have seen their strikeout rates drop in 2017 from a year ago. All told, the Astros lead the majors in batting average and on-base-plus-slugging percentage, to go along with their barrage of home runs.\u201cContact is your friend in this game. There are a lot of good things that can happen when you make contact,\u201d manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve developed is a lineup that has quality at-bats.\u201dThey have accomplished this by preaching an approach at the plate that seems to go against modern baseball wisdom. Reddick said that with the Boston Red Sox and Oakland Athletics, his employers from 2009 until last August, \u201cWe were taught to work counts and tire out the pitchers.\u201d They preached patience and the value of walks, even if it led to more strikeouts.The Astros don\u2019t subscribe to that notion, empowering their players to hack away at the first hittable strike the pitcher offers them. As a result, they see just 3.8 pitches per plate appearance, fifth fewest in baseball. Hinch calls it a \u201cswing-first\u201d attitude, rather than the \u201ctake-first\u201d mind-set that some other teams espouse.To Hinch, the ultra-patient style once so prevalent is an outdated model, and the Astros are at the forefront of a smarter way. Many teams have striven to drive the starter\u2019s pitch count up and force their opponent to turn to the bullpen. Now, with relievers becoming more dominant, \u201cStarters are taken out early, anyway,\u201d Hinch said.In most cases, the Astros believe, facing an opposing bullpen can be a death sentence.\u201cThe notion that the manager is going to wait 100 pitches to take the starter out is not how it\u2019s handled,\u201d Hinch added. \u201cThe danger of going up trying to take pitches is you might miss a lot of pitches that you can drive.\u201dIt looks as if the players have bought in, even ones not exactly known for contact.Catcher Brian McCann struck out in 19% of his plate appearances for the New York Yankees over the past two seasons. A left-handed swinger, he said he \u201chad gotten into some bad habits\u201d by aiming for the short right-field porch at Yankee Stadium.Since arriving in Houston in a November trade, McCann has retooled his swing, focusing on keeping his front shoulder closed and working the middle of the field. His strikeout rate has plummeted to 14%. He is homering every 16.6 at-bats, the best mark of his career.\u201cI hit rock bottom,\u201d McCann said. \u201cI know I\u2019m not a .230, .240 hitter, so I needed to make a change.\u201dSuccess stories like that have come to define the 2017 Astros, as they chase the first World Series championship in the franchise\u2019s 55-year history. In his first season with Houston, Reddick\u2019s strikeout rate is four percentage points lower than his career average. Utility man Marwin Gonzalez is on pace to hit 28 home runs, while his strikeout rate has dropped from 23% to 19.7%. In his first full season, Bregman\u2019s strikeout rate has fallen from 24% last year to 18% this year.All of this, the Astros players say, stems from the fact that at a fundamental level, they disagree with the idea that strikeouts are just like any other out, that they don\u2019t matter.\u201cFor me, it matters,\u201d said the 40-year-old Beltran, a 20-year veteran and clubhouse leader. \u201cI hate to strike out. Honestly, I do.\u201dAt that moment, he turned to Reddick, his neighbor at the next locker.\u201cDo you hate to strike out?\u201d he asked.\u201cI hate it,\u201d Reddick responded. \u201cWe all hate it.\u201dWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 12:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-astros-hit-on-a-winning-formula-lots-of-home-runs-no-strikeouts-1497888821", "news_title": "The Astros Hit on a Winning Formula: Lots of Home Runs, No Strikeouts ", "keywords": "astros,baseball,houston astros,mlb,Houston Astros,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "An activist investor is pushing the parent of Saks Fifth Avenue to consider strategic alternatives, including possibly taking the company private or redeveloping its vast real estate holdings, in the latest sign of the challenges facing the department-store industry.Land & Buildings Investment Management LLC, which has accumulated a stake of roughly 4.3% in             Hudson\u2019s Bay Co.        HBC -2.74%      , said in a letter delivered to the company\u2019s board Monday that its real estate is worth four times the stock price. The Wall Street Journal viewed a copy of the letter.The multiple Land & Buildings cited in its letter was before the shares of Hudson\u2019s Bay rose 15% in Monday afternoon trading in Toronto to 10.20 Canadian dollars (US$7.72).\u201cThis drastic public markets mispricing is why Hudson\u2019s Bay should evaluate all strategic options to maximize value for shareholders,\u201d       Jonathan Litt,        founder and chief investment officer of Land & Buildings, wrote in the letter.He noted that over the past several months, as Hudson\u2019s Bay has taken abortive looks at acquiring             Macy\u2019s Inc.       and then at Neiman Marcus Group\u2014as reported by the Journal, the company\u2019s stock has fallen 25%.The Macy\u2019s talks were preliminary and never progressed far, and the discussions with Neiman Marcus fell apart over price, people familiar with the situation have said. Last week, Neiman Marcus confirmed that any conversations it had been having about selling itself had terminated and it planned to remain independent.Hudson\u2019s Bay on Monday confirmed receipt of the letter Land & Buildings sent its board, and said it will respond in due course.Land & Buildings could face an uphill battle since insiders own a large chunk of the company\u2019s stock, possibly making it difficult to force their hand.This month, Mr. Litt lost a shareholder vote to force change at mall owner             Taubman Centers Inc.      \u2014largely because of the controlling family\u2019s large voting block. He continues to push for change there. Mr. Litt has also been urging change at real-estate empire         Forest City Realty Trust               Inc. and             Brookdale Senior Living Inc.Either way, the campaign is the latest sign of the upheaval roiling the department-store and broader retail industry as shopping habits evolve. Hudson\u2019s Bay recently said it would eliminate 2,000 jobs in North America, part of an effort to\u00a0save $350 million annually.Hudson\u2019s Bay Chairman       Richard Baker       is a real estate executive who grew up building shopping centers with his father Robert, founder of National Realty & Development Corp.He began stitching together a department-store conglomerate a decade ago with the acquisition of Lord & Taylor, followed by Saks Fifth Avenue in 2013. The company also owns the Hudson\u2019s Bay chain in Canada, and Galeria Kaufhof in Germany.To highlight the value of Hudson\u2019s Bay\u2019s real estate, Mr. Baker has formed joint ventures with several mall owners and obtained an independent appraisal of the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship in Manhattan that values the store at more than the $2.9 billion Hudson\u2019s Bay paid for the whole company.\u201cRetail and department stores are at a crossroads,\u201d Mr. Baker told shareholders gathered for the company\u2019s annual meeting earlier this month. But he added that the retailer is taking decisive actions to position the company to adapt, including cost reductions, a relocation of capital spending and bolstering the balance sheet.Mr. Litt, a well-known real estate investor, wants Hudson\u2019s Bay to go further, arguing that it could generate better returns for shareholders by redeveloping its prime department-store space into office towers, hotels or boutiques. Alternatively, Hudson\u2019s Bay could go private, given its modest market capitalization of roughly $1.2 billion and insider ownership of roughly 20%, Mr. Litt argues.Nordstrom                   Inc. recently said it was considering going private as a way to wait out the changes roiling the retail industry as more shoppers migrate online.\u00a0On Friday,             Amazon.com Inc.       said it was buying             Whole Foods Market Inc.       as the online juggernaut ramps up its grocery business.As the share prices of large retail companies have plummeted, investors are eyeing their real estate as a way to unlock value from the chains.

The conflict in the southern Philippines, now entering its fifth week, is raising concerns in Jakarta that militants could flee to neighboring Indonesian islands.The joint patrols were first agreed to more than a year ago, but were delayed over disputes such as overlapping territorial claims, said Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. The continuing battle between Philippine troops and Islamic State-linked militants in the southern Philippine town of Marawi pushed officials to move forward with the plan, Mr. Storey said.\u201cThe Marawi siege, and the recognition that terrorism poses a major security threat to all three countries, has concentrated minds and made this breakthrough possible,\u201d Mr. Storey said. Still, given the vast area of the waters, \u201cchallenges of interoperability and lingering political sensitivities over sovereignty, it remains to be seen how effective these patrols will be.\u201dU.S. Special Forces have been supporting Philippine troops with technical support and intelligence, including providing surveillance planes over Marawi to monitor militant positions. But that support has been limited. U.S. Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       last week cited the Marawi conflict in telling Congress that the U.S. had too quickly decided to end a special-operations task force in the southern Philippines three years ago.The southern Philippines has been under martial law since late May as troops battled local militants in Marawi, a town of about 200,000 people on Mindanao Island, where Philippine extremists have been seeking to create an Islamic caliphate. More than 300 militants, security personnel and civilians have been killed and 180,000 people displaced in a conflict that has included dozens of foreign fighters from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Morocco, officials have said.On Monday, Philippine military officials said militant numbers in Marawi had dwindled, but that some fighters have escaped along with evacuees.Philippine officials also announced the seizure of as much as $5 million worth of crystal methamphetamine from a house in Marawi, along with a cache of advanced firearms.\u201cThey are not ordinary firearms at all but high-powered firearms that can fire from afar,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla, spokesman for the Philippine armed forces. \u201cThis is indicative of the length of planning that went to this operation of these rebels.\u201dIndonesian officials said they are on alert in northern Sulawesi island, Indonesia\u2019s major population base closest to the southern Philippines, about 400 miles from Marawi. Indonesian officials have also said they are beefing up security in northern areas of nearby Borneo, sending three Sukhoi jet fighters to a base there, state media reported.Write to Ben Otto at ben.otto@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 11:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-linked-militants-targeted-in-southeast-asian-sea-patrols-1497870181", "news_title": "Islamic State-Linked Militants Targeted in Southeast Asian Sea Patrols ", "keywords": " celebes sea, conflict, isis, islamic state, marawi, maritime patrols, maute,philippines, sulu sea,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,terrorism"}, {"content": "When CNN acquired Casey Neistat\u2019s social app Beme last fall, the news organization said that by this summer, the pair would have a stand-alone media company focused on \u201ctimely and topical video and empowering content creators to use technology to find their voice.\u201dThey\u2019re still \u201cweeks away\u201d from a fine-tuned programming announcement, but       Mr. Neistat       and CNN Worldwide President       Jeff Zucker       dropped some hints on what\u2019s to come during a panel at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity on Monday.Mr. Neistat said a new show, called Beme, will air four days a week, with the aim of ultimately airing seven days a week. The show \u201cwill talk about the news, but isn\u2019t the news,\u201d he said. Every day, he wants to tell you something you missed, something \u201cyou don\u2019t know.\u201d He\u2019s also \u201cdying to do an investigative reporting series.\u201d He didn\u2019t reveal more specific details on content or timing, only saying that it\u2019ll launch when he deems it \u201cvery good.\u201dThe show will air on YouTube, where Mr. Neistat has been a sensation.For CNN, it\u2019s about creating something new with Beme, versus just taking video reporting and putting it on \u201ca platform where young people go,\u201d said Mr. Zucker.However, rethinking news content for a much younger audience is indeed the objective with Beme, as well as other CNN ventures like the 2015 launch of millennial-oriented digital media brand Great Big Story.The average age of a CNN viewer is 59 years old, which is more than twice the average age of a Great Big Story viewer, said Mr. Zucker. \u201cCasey is someone I knew through my children,\u201d he said. \u201c[Beme] is a way to attract an even younger audience than Great Big Story.\u201dStill, old media and new media mashups aren\u2019t so simple, and Mr. Zucker and Mr. Neistat have had to work through their differences.Mr. Neistat described news shows with talking heads, much like those on CNN, as boring. \u201cI don\u2019t know who those people are,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a relationship with them. They\u2019re old.\u201d He\u2019d rather feature opinions from a \u201cdiversified cross-section of the world,\u201d through an app, he said.Also, a big media organization like CNN might handle a new show or product launch with a large ad campaign.Mr. Neistat said he would prefer to roll out his new show without an ad and public relations blitz, when he\u2019s ready. When he built his YouTube brand, he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a big sexy ad or reel\u201d that said, \u201cthis is the Casey blog, and it\u2019s coming,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to emulate that [here] with the tremendous resources of CNN.\u201dAt one point, Mr. Zucker expressed his frustration that Beme had not yet rolled out its new content, but he also acknowledged the importance of letting Mr. Neistat handle things his way.\u201cI\u2019d like you to launch last week,\u201d said Mr. Zucker. \u201cA thing we\u2019ve learned in this process is we can\u2019t rush that.

The company announced Monday that its late-stage clinical trial for cancer treatment Rubraca was a success in patients with ovarian cancer. Shares ripped more than 46% higher Monday. After the trading session, the company announced it would issue about $250 million in shares.That celebratory mood didn\u2019t spread to every corner of the industry, however.

Elizabeth Warren       (D, Mass.) is urging the Federal Reserve to remove a dozen             Wells Fargo        WFC 0.26%       board directors who served during the bank\u2019s sales-practices scandal, according to a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.In the letter sent to Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       on Monday, Sen. Warren urged the Fed to invoke its authority under a rule that allows it to remove certain people associated with depository institutions under specific circumstances.Sen. Warren pointed to 12 directors who served on the San Francisco bank\u2019s board between May 2011 and July 2015, a period in which Wells Fargo fired 5,300 employees for the bad behavior. The bank settled with two regulators and a city official in September for $185 million over the practices. Its chief executive later abruptly retired and the bank continues to face state and federal investigations, which it has said it is cooperating with.A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the board and its management team have \u201ctaken many actions in response to its retail sales practices issues, including changes in senior leadership, executive accountability actions and numerous steps to ensure we make things right with any customer affected by unacceptable sales practices.\u201d She added that the work is ongoing.The bank\u2019s board has also endured harsh criticism and faced opposition during a contentious shareholder meeting in late April. Several directors were re-elected to their roles by just a slim margin.Sen. Warren has been a sharp critic of Wells Fargo\u2019s management and handling of the sales-practices scandal. When former CEO       John Stumpf       appeared before the Senate Banking Committee to explain the problems, Sen. Warren lambasted him and said he should resign and be criminally investigated.In her eight-page letter to the Fed, Sen. Warren wrote that the sales-practices scandal \u201crevealed severe problems with the bank\u2019s risk management practices\u2013\u2013problems that justify the Federal Reserve\u2019s removal of all responsible Board members.\u201dIn the wake of the scandal, Wells Fargo\u2019s board conducted an investigation of the bank, but largely didn\u2019t fault directors. On a call with media after the report was disclosed in April, Chairman Stephen Sanger said \u201cthe findings of the investigation showed the board took the appropriate actions with the information it had, when it had it\u201d and that it hired a law firm to do the investigation to get \u201can independent and objective assessment of our performance.\u201dSen. Warren\u2019s letter cited the Fed\u2019s ability to remove board members including if they \u201cengaged or participated in any unsafe or unsound practice\u201d that caused certain depository institutions to \u201csuffer financial loss\u201d and that demonstrated \u201ccontinuing disregard\u2026for the safety and soundness\u201d of the institution.\u201cI urge the Federal Reserve to use the tools Congress has given it to remove the responsible Board members and protect the continued safety and soundness of one of the country\u2019s largest banks,\u201d the senator\u2019s letter said.The 12 board directors mentioned in the letter are:       John D. Baker II,       John S. Chen,       Lloyd H. Dean,       Elizabeth A. Duke,       Enrique Hernandez, Jr.      ,       Donald M. James,       Cynthia H. Milligan,       Federico F.

Vautrinot.Among those directors, Ms. Duke, who is now the board\u2019s vice chair, is a former Fed governor.Sen. Warren wrote to the Fed that the board \u201cfailed to create an adequate risk management framework that would have alerted it to systemic problems with retail sales practices. It also caused long-lasting reputational damage to the bank that has eroded the bank\u2019s customer base.\u201dThe board\u2019s own report about the sales scandal, according to the letter, showed its \u201ccontinuing disregard\u201d for the bank\u2019s safety and soundness and failure to seriously address the sales-practices issues despite years of concerns.The board\u2019s April report largely placed blame on Mr. Stumpf and former retail-banking head       Carrie Tolstedt.       The board clawed back an additional $75 million in compensation from them both.The company was slow to stamp out the issues, the report said, in part because its decentralized structure gave Ms. Tolstedt too much power and officials from other units, such as risk management, human resources and legal, either couldn\u2019t connect the dots on problems or weren\u2019t powerful enough to do anything about it.In late 2015, board members, including then-lead independent director Mr. Sanger, pushed Mr. Stumpf to remove Ms. Tolstedt from her role. But Mr. Stumpf declined, saying that Ms. Tolstedt, while at times controlling, was \u201cthe best banker in America,\u201d the report said.The report also highlighted how the bank\u2019s push to boost revenue and profit trickled down to thousands of employees who felt pressured to meet unrealistic sales goals.Write to Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Warren Keeps Pressure on Wells.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 11:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sen-warren-calls-for-removal-of-12-wells-fargo-directors-1497879475", "news_title": "Sen.

And chief gorilla habituator Robert Mulimbi did have to slog through the heavy undergrowth in a makeshift white-guy mask cut from a manila envelope to bring Mpungwe around.\u201cWhen we got this idea, it seemed like a joke,\u201d giggled one of Mr. Mulimbi\u2019s assistants, ranger Sandro Masumbuko. \u201cBut it got a good result.\u201dSuch is the curious life of the man charged with acclimating Kahuzi-Biega\u2019s gorillas to tourists. Park officials here are eager to attract well-heeled Europeans and Americans for gorilla trekking vacations, and it is Mr. Mulimbi\u2019s job to make sure the gorillas are on board.Kahuzi-Biega is the wild frontier of gorilla tourism. The eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been beset by on-and-off war and roving militias since the Rwandan genocide spilled across the border in the mid-1990s.The park, however, is the only place in the wild where visitors can see the world\u2019s largest gorillas, the Grauer\u2019s subspecies, and Congo\u2019s park service hopes a period of relative peace will put Kahuzi-Biega on the bucket lists of the adventuresome. Gorilla tourism, they say, serves two purposes: It brings in revenue to protect the park and its wildlife, and it generates income for nearby villagers who might otherwise consider the animals fair game for dinner.There were some 17,000 Grauer\u2019s gorillas\u2014also known as eastern lowland gorillas\u2014in Congo in 1995. Some 77% of them were slaughtered during the fighting and the subspecies is now listed as critically endangered, according to the U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society. Among those killed were virtually every member of five families habituated to human presence in the 1.5 million-acre Kahuzi-Biega park, which is a Unesco World Heritage site.When the poachers approached, the gorillas didn\u2019t sense the danger, Mr. Mulimbi said. \u201cThey thought they were tourists who had come to see them, so they were killed,\u201d he said.With the fighting subsided, park officials believe they can now market Kahuzi-Biega as the best-kept wildlife secret since the mythical elephant graveyard. High-season mountain gorilla-viewing permits go for $600 per person, per day in Uganda\u2019s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Rwanda recently doubled the price of its mountain-gorilla passes in Volcanoes National Park, to $1,500.Kahuzi-Biega charges $400 to visit the Grauer\u2019s gorillas, a per-pound bargain.\u201cI don\u2019t know if their gorillas are better than ours or what,\u201d said Juvenal Munganga, who is in charge of visits to Kahuzi-Biega. The park logged 1,124 visitors last year, but many of those were aid workers, U.N. peacekeepers and others in Congo because of\u2014not in spite of\u2014its instability and poverty. Foreigners who live in Congo get a discount.Park authorities are habituating enough gorillas to attract more ecotourists, while exposing as few animals as necessary to the dangers habituation can entail. Some 200 rangers, armed with AK-47 rifles, defend the park from poachers.Chimanuka was one of the few habituated gorillas who survived the onslaught of militia fighters, poachers and desperate civilians who occupied the park during the war. Now he is a full-grown silverback, and he, his three wives and 15 children are the park\u2019s stars. The adults are largely indifferent to visitors of any race, placidly stripping leaves from vines and loudly passing gas while young gorillas engage in horseplay.Mpungwe is another story, still tentative in his embrace of the tourism industry. Even when Mr. Mulimbi approaches, Mpungwe keeps to the shadows, glaring at the rangers through branches, then stages dramatic charges to declare his dominance and test the threat level to his seven wives and 12 children.Mr. Mulimbi, now 52 years old, was giving tours at a local tea plantation when his English skills caught the attention of park officials. He soon found he had a knack for cozying up to gorillas.Essentially, habituators trail gorillas through the forest until the animals conclude the rangers may be boorish, but they\u2019re not a threat. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of following these animals until they get tired of running away from you,\u201d said world-renowned lemurologist Russ Mittermeier.Each day around 6 p.m., the silverback will beat his chest to signal it is time for the family to make camp for the night. Adults gather leaves and branches to create nests on the ground. Youngsters build theirs in the trees to keep watch.In the morning, each Grauer\u2019s gorilla defecates next to the nest\u2014mountain gorillas defecate in their nests\u2014and the family sets off in search of a nice place to spend the day eating bamboo, leaves or sweet myrianthus fruit. A big male, who can stand about 5 feet tall, consumes 70 pounds of food a day.Trackers, many of them pygmies born to the forest, machete their way through the dense undergrowth, searching for gorilla nests, dung and trails amid the wild celery stalks. They read dung for size and freshness to determine who was where when.\u201cThe gorillas put my children in university,\u201d said pygmy tracker Antoine Bakongo Lushombo, dressed in the standard ranger uniform of green beret, faded fatigues and colorful Wellington boots.When he locates the gorilla family, Mr. Mulimbi pays homage to the silverback. A tip: Don\u2019t surprise a gorilla. He won\u2019t like it. Mr. Mulimbi routinely coughs or emits a low growl to signal his friendly approach. If the big male is at ease, so are the others.Mpungwe, however, frequently charges screaming through the underbrush, tearing at the branches before pulling up just short of actual gorilla-human contact.Mr. Mulimbi believes these mock attacks give him a chance to show Mpungwe he isn\u2019t a threat. When Mpungwe rushes the rangers, Mr. Mulimbi steps slowly aside and murmurs, \u201cCalm, calm.\u201dRwandan authorities urge visitors not to make eye contact with a charging gorilla. In Kahuzi-Biega, however, rangers meet the silverback\u2019s gaze. Nobody recommends running away. Another tip: Don\u2019t let the silverback get the uphill position. He will use it to his advantage.\u201cIt\u2019s like a man,\u201d said Mr. Mulimbi. \u201cSometimes he can be angry. Sometimes he can be good.\u201dThe bad moments are hard to forget.One time, a silverback named Mubalala grabbed Mr. Mulimbi, squeezed the breath out of him and carried him 15 feet before dropping him unconscious to the ground. Mr. Mulimbi remembers nothing of the incident after the initial contact.Despite that run-in, Mr. Mulimbi wept when Mubalala was killed during the war.Famed primate researcher Dian Fossey tried to keep the mountain gorillas she studied in Rwanda wary of Africans. Her theory was that whites were unlikely to be poachers, according to Mr. Mittermeier, who visited Ms. Fossey\u2019s research station in 1984, the year before she was murdered by an unknown assailant.When the race issue surfaced in Kahuzi-Biega, Mr. Mulimbi had been following Mpungwe for a year, hacking his way through steep mountainsides thick with vines and gradually moving closer to the silverback and his family. After he won Mpungwe\u2019s grudging trust, he asked park headquarters to dispatch a couple of test tourists to confirm the gorilla was ready for paying visitors.Mpungwe\u2019s reaction\u2014escape and incontinence\u2014was not the stuff of tourist brochures.\u201cWhen he saw just at the beginning, he saw the white color, he thought maybe it was dangerous for him,\u201d said Mr. Mulimbi.Not to be deterred, Mr. Mulimbi cut eye, mouth and nostril holes in a large manila envelope and tied it on with stringy fibers peeled from a green stick. The result was something akin to a last-minute Halloween costume.Then he started the habituation process anew.The Congolese rangers laugh at the absurdity of the envelope masquerade, rendered even more ridiculous because they\u2019re required to wear a surgical mask over the envelope to avoid transmitting human diseases to the apes.\u201cThis envelope is like a white man,\u201d said Mr. Mulimbi. \u201cIf you can use this every time you come across gorillas, maybe Mpungwe will enjoy to see white people.\u201dIndeed, after several months tracking Mpungwe in manila-face, Mr. Mulimbi decided he had made enough progress to ask headquarters to send him more white tourists. This time Mpungwe took them in stride.Write to Michael M. Phillips at michael.phillips@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Come Back!

In a video for the company\u2019s roadshow before its public offering, Snap\u2019s chief strategist,       Imran Khan,        framed Snap\u2019s opportunity by highlighting how young people ages 18 to 24 have shifted their attention to mobile phones from traditional TV.\u201cThese users represent a big opportunity for us because they are harder to reach on traditional media, and they are often highly sought after by advertisers,\u201d Mr. Khan said in the video.The $100 million deal encompasses Time Warner\u2019s show investment for the app as well as an advertising commitment from HBO, Warner Bros. and its Turner networks. Time Warner\u2019s sale to             AT&T Inc.       is pending with regulators.Snap will keep 50% of the ad revenue from shows, while its media partners will keep the other half, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported. It is a less attractive split than what Snap offered earlier on for its \u201cDiscover\u201d publisher platform, where at least some partners were allowed to keep 70% of the ad revenue if they sold the ads.Time Warner\u2019s commitment is a vote of confidence for the young company as it seeks to convince investors its new advertising form will grow. Snap disappointed investors in May when its revenue, which comes almost entirely from advertising, surged from a year earlier, but declined sequentially for the first time.Still, the app has become a darling for traditional media executives who are eager to reach younger viewers as traditional pay-TV cord-cutting accelerates. Snap has already signed up a variety of big media companies like             Comcast Corp.\u2019s       NBCUniversal and             CBS Corp.       to create shows for its app, and its executives have taken a hands-on approach to curating its originals, advising traditional network executives on everything from plotlines to shooting angles.Media executives say early viewership metrics from Snap are promising. For example, Snap said that NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d on Snapchat is up 45% in viewership in its second season.

The rock history repository is gearing up for a permanent presence in Tokyo, marking its first international expansion since opening its headquarters in Cleveland 22 years ago.The project will start with the opening this September of a short-term exhibition, featuring pieces from the Beatles and other hall of famers, in a retrofitted retail space in central Tokyo, said       Greg Harris,        president and chief executive of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. With a budget of $24 million, that launch will be followed by site selection and construction of a stand-alone museum, including a planned concert space designed to host several thousand people.The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Japan is being created through a licensing agreement with a group of Japanese collaborators in music, media and business, some of whom brought the U.S. Rock Hall\u2019s splashy induction ceremonies to Japanese television. They\u2019re hoping to build on the buzz for that annual broadcast and Japan\u2019s famous affinity for rock culture, Mr. Harris said. Japan is the world\u2019s second biggest market for music sales behind the United States.The Tokyo beachhead is the latest in a broader push by the Cleveland institution to turn up the volume. After two decades, the Rock Hall had gone from a maverick startup museum to a tourism mainstay coasting on its reputation. \u201cWe settled into maintenance mode\u201d with relatively flat admission and revenue, said Mr. Harris, who became CEO in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s essential that we\u2019re more than just a shrine to what happened before.\u201dAudience analysis confirmed the need to diversify the Rock Hall\u2019s audience beyond the perceived core of nostalgic baby boomers.

Current traveling exhibits include dives into the culture of music festivals, and the history of rock, politics and protest.Renovations include the addition of a high-tech theater opening July 1 with a highlight film of induction performances created by director Jonathan Demme, who died in April.Last year, total annual attendance in Cleveland hit 543,000, the highest since the Rock Hall\u2019s opening and an increase of roughly 100,000 since 2014. Operating revenue jumped to $24 million in 2016, up 18% from the year before.The Rock Hall has explored the possibility of international expansion before, but talks with potential partners in London, Berlin and other cities didn\u2019t pan out. In Tokyo, the initial exhibit will launch with artifacts from global crowdpleasers such as Madonna, but the planned museum will emphasize music history with relevance to Japan.From an American perspective, Japan can sometimes seem like a parallel reality of rock popularity. The phrase \u201cbig in Japan\u201d has long applied to Western acts with disproportionate success there. In the mockumentary film \u201cSpinal Tap,\u201d the pariah heavy metal band goes out on a high note when it scores a hit in Japan.For many rockers, however, the phenomenon is real and welcome.

The state, citing concerns about recidivism, argued the law was a sensible measure to prevent offenders from anonymously gathering information about minors on social media that could be used to target future victims.The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling recognized the central role in American life now played by social media sites. The justices sided with       Lester Packingham,        who pleaded guilty in 2002 to taking indecent liberties with a 13-year-old when he was age 21. In 2010, a Durham, N.C., police officer found Mr. Packingham had written a post on Facebook to celebrate a dismissed traffic ticket.The state brought charges, and Mr. Packingham was convicted at trial in 2012.\u00a0He received a suspended prison sentence as well as supervised probation, but he continued to challenge his conviction on First Amendment grounds.In court papers, lawyers for Mr. Packingham said the state had used its law to prosecute more than 1,000 people for visiting sites including Facebook, Google+, Instagram and YouTube.The high court ruling Monday left open the possibility the state could craft a narrower law that barred offenders from having contact with minors online but didn\u2019t prohibit them from using social media entirely.The court was unanimous in ruling against North Carolina, though three justices\u2014      Samuel Alito,       John Roberts       and       Clarence Thomas      \u2014declined to join Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion, saying some of its language was too sweeping.Justice       Neil Gorsuch       didn\u2019t participate in the case, which was argued before he joined the high court.Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 11:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-invalidates-n-c-law-barring-sex-offenders-from-social-media-1497885304", "news_title": "Supreme Court Invalidates N.C.

The deals, to be unveiled this week at the Paris Air Show, would be for more than 240 aircraft.The plane carries a price tag of $124.7 million each, though buyers get discounts. It is expected to enter service in 2020.Boeing began the Paris Air Show announcing 135 deals for the 737 Max 10, though some buyers have switched from commitments made previously to other models. At list price, the value of the announced Max 10 deals tops $16 billion.Chicago-based Boeing lined up a list of plane-leasing companies to underpin interest in the new jetliner. Lessors have become increasingly important customers for plane makers.Among them are             General Electric Co.\u2019s       plane-leasing arm, known as Gecas, which signed an order for 20 of the planes.

They cost far less than larger widebody planes and can fly attractive routes such as U.S. coast-to-coast or even some shorter trans-Atlantic hops.Airbus has had a lead on Boeing in this growing and increasingly important plane segment. About 65% of the European aircraft maker\u2019s single-aisle deals last year were for the largest version. Airbus began to deliver its rival A321neo planes to airline customers in April and has won 1,416 orders through May for its model.Airbus plane boss       Fabrice Br\u00e9gier       said Monday that the company\u2019s biggest single-aisle aircraft would likely represent half of all narrowbody deliveries. He said even in the face of Boeing\u2019s new plane, Airbus would maintain a market-share edge. The European plane maker announced its own Gecas deal for 100 single-aisle planes.Airbus had outsold Boeing\u2019s big single-aisle jets before the introduction of the 737 Max 10. Now the U.S. plane maker is striking back.Big narrowbodies are particularly important for future profits. Boeing and Airbus can charge a premium for the planes that are slightly larger and can hold more passengers even though they cost only a little more to produce. Airlines prize the models with added seats because it allows them to spread costs over more passengers, typically boosting returns when planes are full.Boeing\u2019s Max 10 can seat as many as 230 passengers. The Airbus plane can fit 240 passengers.Mr. McAllister said the new plane will come with relatively low extra development costs because of its similarity to smaller versions.Airbus isn\u2019t ready to cede its lead, though. Even ahead of the Boeing announcement,       John Leahy,        chief plane salesman at Airbus said his rival product will have greater range and lower per-seat costs. \u201cThey do have a slightly lower price on their airplane,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you get what you pay for.\u201dBoeing disputes that its plane\u2019s range is inferior to its Airbus rival.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 11:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-launches-new-plane-as-rivalry-with-airbus-continues-1497862945", "news_title": "Boeing Launches New Plane as Rivalry With Airbus Continues", "keywords": "ge capital aviation services,gecas, narrowbody planes,paris air show, plane sales figures,Boeing,BA,Airbus,AIR.FR,Lion Air,SpiceJet,IN:500285,Qatar Airways,AerCap Holdings N.V.,AER,John Leahy,Fabrice Br\u00e9gier,Kevin McAllister,Akbar Al Baker,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,travel,aerospace products,parts,aircraft engines,civil aircraft,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,aerospace,defense,air transport,industrial goods,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "Vice Media has secured a $450 million investment from private-equity firm TPG, as the youth-focused digital media company looks to step up its spending on scripted programming and plans a direct-to-consumer service.The deal will give Vice a valuation of around $5.7 billion, including the new investment, people familiar with the situation say.Media giant             Walt Disney Co.      , which has pumped $400 million into Vice and owns an 18% stake, didn\u2019t participate in the funding round. Disney\u2019s stake will be diluted along with those of other existing shareholders, according to the people.Last summer, there was speculation Disney could purchase all of Vice, in part because it had already placed a significant bet on the company. Neither side denied the merits of a potential union. But after an\u00a0initial storybook romance, a Disney takeover now looks unlikely at this stage, the people familiar with the situation say.Vice will use some of the new money to create a subscription service based on something similar it offers in Japan for mobile phones. The company will also invest in scripted programming for its fledgling Viceland cable channel and mobile and digital platforms, and expand its international footprint.Viceland, a joint venture with A+E Networks, airs shows like \u201cBong Appetit,\u201d which is about chefs who make cannabis-infused food, and \u201cBalls Deep,\u201d about a journalist who immerses himself in others\u2019 lives. It has struggled to build an audience, averaging just 96,000 viewers in prime-time since September including live plus same-day recorded viewing, according to Nielsen.Vice executives are optimistic and point to the example of             Discovery Communications Inc.\u2019s       Oprah Winfrey Network, which also got off to a slow start in the ratings before gaining traction after a few years. They also note that Viceland is attracting younger viewers than H2, the A+E channel it replaced.Vice executives say part of the challenge has been creating enough programming to fill 24 hours from scratch, as the company mostly develops its own shows in-house. The move into scripted programming\u2014like the recently announced show \u201cWhat Would Diplo Do?,\u201d a parody program in which \u201cDawson\u2019 Creek\u201d star       James Vanderbeek       portrays the DJ and music producer Diplo\u2014is expected to help.The turbulence in the pay-TV world has affected Disney as much as anyone. Indeed, one reason its executives are less focused on Vice, people familiar with the matter say, is that their attention has been focused on righting the ship at ESPN, which has begun to suffer the financial effects of losing cable subscribers in recent years.Disney has been trying to figure out where ESPN will fit in the streaming-media landscape. Disney last August plunked down $1 billion to buy 33% of BAMTech, Major League Baseball\u2019s streaming media unit, and has since said it plans to offer streaming services targeted at specific teams, regions and sports.Disney remains committed to Vice and is optimistic about its potential, a person familiar with the situation said.Vice, like BuzzFeed, Vox and other digital media outfits, looked especially attractive to traditional media companies a few years ago. All those companies were able to build large audiences of young people online at a time when cable TV was struggling to retain viewers under 35. But sustaining fast-paced growth has been difficult across-the-board for digital media companies, and traditional media giants now evaluate their investments with even more scrutiny than they did before.Disney\u2019s dance with Vice began in 2014, when A+E Networks\u2014Disney\u2019s joint venture with Hearst\u2014invested $250 million in the digital media outlet. In late 2015, Disney invested an additional $400 million over two separate rounds, valuing the company at between $4 billion and $4.5 billion.Last August, shortly after a Wall Street Journal article about the prospects for a Disney-Vice tie-up and interest in the idea on both sides, Vice Chief Executive       Shane Smith      told the Hollywood Reporter that such a deal \u201cmakes sense for them and it makes sense for us.\u201dOne person familiar with the matter says Mr. Smith has eyed a $6 billion-to-$7 billion price tag for the whole company.In January, Mr. Smith brought a plan to the board laying out a road map for an initial public offering, but the company determined that the time wasn\u2019t right, people familiar with the situation said.A person familiar with the matter said Vice, sensing that an acquisition by a strategic player like Disney wasn\u2019t in the offing, decided to bring in financial investors and pursued the private-equity deal.A Vice spokesman disputed that Mr. Smith ever brought an IPO plan to the board and denied that the company viewed a private-equity round as a fallback plan.\u2014Ben Fritz contributed to this article.Write to Lukas I.

That\u2019s especially the case on foreign affairs\u2014and in particular on trade policy.President Donald Trump sounds as if he wants to take a wrecking ball to the international trade system; people fear trade wars because his commentary often has a martial air about it.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t mind trade wars\u201d when the U.S. is running big trade deficits, he said at one point. His talk of new tariffs should be read as a \u201cthreat,\u201d he said during the presidential campaign. He once referred to China as \u201cour enemy\u201d because of its trade practices, while Germany\u00a0is \u201cbad, very bad.\u201dBy contrast, his most influential trade adviser, Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross,        gives a more reasoned explanation of Trump policies. He also uses the \u201ctrade war\u201d phraseology, but he offers a philosophical context to explain why he thinks that\u2019s already the state of affairs. Perhaps most important, he puts the administration\u2019s quest for change in the international trade architecture into a historical context\u2014one with which many Democrats would agree.When Mr. Ross appeared last week at the Journal\u2019s CFO Network, he described the international trade regime as a kind of anachronism\u2014one that was founded with the best of intentions amid postwar rubble but that now has fallen out of sync with modern economic realities.\u201cAfter World War II, there was a deliberate matter of our public policy to try to help the war-ravaged nations rebuild themselves,\u201d Mr. Ross said. At that point, obviously, the U.S. was the world\u2019s dominant economic power by far, and its self-interest lay in helping its European allies and Japan pull themselves up economically to ward off the spread of communism. America not only could afford to be generous in trade relations but had a profound self-interest in doing so.That attitude, Mr. Ross argued, \u201cmorphed\u201d into the alphabet-soup structures that constitute today\u2019s international trade architecture\u2014first the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, then the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the World Trade Organization.Along the way, the world evolved and the allies caught up with the dominant U.S., but, Mr. Ross argued, \u201cour policies didn\u2019t really change. And so we now have a terrible structural problem that I think is really inhibiting free trade.\u201dThat history, he said, has produced some \u201coxymoronic\u201d outcomes. For example, the tariff on a European automobile sent into the U.S. is 2.5%, while the tariff on an American automobile sent into Europe is 10%, despite the fact that the two markets now are roughly the same size.Perhaps most important, the international trade structure didn\u2019t anticipate the rise of a command-economy giant in China as a trade juggernaut, with the imbalances that has created. Nor, given that the structure was created in an era of fixed exchange rates, did it anticipate the ability of countries to manipulate currency values to give their exports an advantage.A few caveats are in order. On auto trade with Europe, for example, the European Union doesn\u2019t dispute the tariff imbalance. But it also notes that the same is true in reverse on, for example, passenger-train cars, on which the U.S. imposes a 14% duty on European imports, while the EU charges 1.7% on those bought from the U.S. \u201cThe EU wants to remove these duties and other barriers to trade, such as lengthy administrative checks, that increase the cost of trade in goods,\u201d the EU says in an online explanation of its view.Still, the broader Ross argument is one that many on the Democratic side in the U.S. would accept. \u201cI think Ross is right,\u201d says Jared Bernstein,\u00a0senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\u00a0and onetime chief economic adviser to former Vice President       Joe Biden.       The trade \u201cmacro infrastructure\u201d is \u201cproblematic,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are countries that manage trade in such a way as to boost their trade surpluses and essentially import jobs from other countries.\u201dMr. Bernstein suggests changing international trade agreements to allow a country to offset currency manipulation by a trading partner by buying that partner\u2019s currency. More broadly, he advocates establishing a high-level, bipartisan commission to find a consensus approach to such issues\u2014ideally led by investor       Warren Buffett.Ultimately, though, even the hardline Trump view argues for, not against, negotiated solutions. Douglas Irwin, an economist and trade historian at Dartmouth College, notes that, unlike the U.S., Mexico \u201cdoesn\u2019t face any tariffs when they export their autos to Europe.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause they have a free-trade agreement.\u2026If we want to get rid of that tariff, we have to have a free trade agreement with the EU.\u201dWrite to Gerald F.

It\u2019s what happens when our mind learns to associate an object or person with a feeling\u2014good or bad\u2014that we had when we were previously around that object or person. Have you ever gotten sick after eating something and forever hated that food? Do you have a song that reminds you of your first love? You\u2019ve experienced it.The new research on evaluative conditioning was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense as part of the Military Suicide Research Consortium, an effort to stem the suicide rate of active military members and veterans. The goal is to find ways to strengthen soldiers\u2019 marriages and, therefore, their support systems.The researchers brought into their lab 120 couples married for three to four years and assessed their implicit, or gut-level, feelings toward their partner\u2014the ones they may not want to acknowledge or even know they have. They did this by showing participants pictures of their partner followed by negative and positive words, timing how quickly they could identify the words. They also asked participants how they felt about their spouse.They then showed the participants a slideshow once every three days for six weeks. Half viewed one that intermittently included photos of their spouse paired on a split screen with positive images (of puppies, bunnies and sunsets) and positive words (\u201cincredible,\u201d \u201cterrific,\u201d \u201camazing\u201d). Half viewed one with photos of their partner intermittently paired with neutral images (of a chair, a shed, gravel) and neutral words (\u201cIf,\u201d \u201clike,\u201d \u201cwhen\u201d). Researchers measured the participants\u2019 implicit attitudes toward their partner every two weeks for eight weeks, and again asked them how they felt about their spouse.The people who viewed the bunnies and puppies images became happier in their relationship. Their implicit feelings improved, and they also reported that they felt better about their partner. \u201cIt was like they went on 13 artificial good dates,\u201d says       Jim McNulty,        a professor in the psychology department at Florida State and the lead researcher on the study.The researchers haven't designed a way to intervene with soldiers and their spouses yet, they say. They believe they first need to figure out how many sessions of the slideshow and which photos will work best.Dr. McNulty believes that evaluative conditioning can be used to improve other types of relationships in addition to romantic ones. We might be able to prime ourselves to like our difficult siblings, co-workers or in-laws more by actively trying to associate them with something positive. Imagine viewing a photo of your crabby boss alongside a picture of a duckling or a baby elephant.People will need to be careful, though, because evaluative conditioning cuts both ways. Just as the positive thoughts or experiences we associate with a person can make us like him or her more, negative ones can make us like that person less. Arguments and fights, complaints about work, parenting stress: \u201cWe come to associate our partners with these negative effects, and they very reliably lead to relationship dissatisfaction,\u201d Dr. McNulty says.Dr. McNulty\u2019s tips for using evaluative conditioning to improve your relationship.Pay attention to how we develop and strengthen our relationships. Recognize that positive experiences make us feel positive toward someone, while the opposite is true as well.Boost the positive. Do more activities together that you both enjoy and aim for new experiences. Research shows that when romantic partners try something new together they feel more attracted to each other. They come to associate the excitement of the new activity with their partner.Create a new screen saver. Split the screen: On one side, have a photo of your partner and on the other a photo of something that makes you smile, say a bunny or a beer. Better yet, use a photo of your loved one cuddling a cute baby animal.Minimize the negative. When you are together, try to put your bad mood aside because you will come to automatically associate complaining with your partner. If you are in a bad mood, it might be better not to hang out with your partner until you feel better, Dr. McNulty says.Always weave in something happy. When you want to be with your partner after you\u2019ve had a bad day, try to include some positive emotions. Hug or cuddle. Share a good meal or a bottle of wine. Make sure the conversation includes something happy.Have sex. It is one of the most enjoyable experiences you can have with a partner. Sex releases feel-good chemicals in the brain, always a positive. And research shows that people who have more sex with their partner have more positive implicit feelings toward him or her, meaning they are happier in the relationship.Write to Elizabeth Bernstein at elizabeth.bernstein@wsj.comor follow her on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram at EBernsteinWSJ.Appeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'The Secret to Love: Bunny Photos.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 10:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-secret-to-relationship-success-may-be-bunny-photos-1497883925", "news_title": "The Secret to Relationship Success May Be Bunny Photos", "keywords": "bad mood,good mood,happiness,happy marriages,marital problems,marriage,psychology,relationship advice,sex,suicide,political,general news,living,lifestyle,relationships"}, {"content": "\u201cThe Lego Batman Movie,\u201d by appearances, should have crushed its rival, \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose,\u201d when the two U.S.-made films opened March 3 in China.\u201cLego Batman,\u201d already a world-wide hit, paired a universally known superhero with the popular building-block toy.

That has turned out to be less reliable than finding the right backers.Six American movies this year have grossed more in China than they did in the U.S., and four of them had Chinese investors.

The ability to wirelessly communicate with traffic lights and other vehicles on the road is a Holy Grail for auto makers and equipment suppliers racing to develop self-driving functionality.Even though fully connected vehicles may not be on the market until the next decade, auto makers and suppliers are giving drivers a taste of what tomorrow may bring.Several manufacturers are adding wireless features onto some new vehicles, such as alerting drivers to low tire or oil pressure and updating touch-screen systems without a service visit. But drivers of older cars can get these new features, too: Some companies are promoting a simple workaround that can add those services to older cars that were never designed for it.\u201cConnectivity can be added to existing vehicles,\u201d says Ben Hoffman, chief executive of Movimento, a software provider acquired in January by auto-parts supplier             Delphi Automotive                   PLC. It plans to tap into latent demand for connected services among drivers of the 264 million cars and light trucks already on the road in the U.S., according to data provider             IHS Markit.Retrofitting uses a technology that few drivers actually see but has been standard on all vehicles made since 1996: diagnostic access points, called OBD-II ports, typically located under the steering column. Palm-size devices known as dongles\u2014typically used by repair-shop technicians\u2014plug into the ports and can be linked to cellular or Wi-Fi signals via smartphone.Dongles allow drivers to do things like export trip data to spreadsheets, automatically inform emergency contacts if the car is in an accident and offer 3G wireless connections. Future uses could include collecting data on traffic flows and potentially allowing drivers to avoid red lights by using smart grids to time their trips.Some IT experts warn that these devices are more vulnerable to hackers precisely because they are a workaround for cars lacking advanced software and security. \u201cDongles add a lot of risk,\u201d says Craig Smith, research director of transportation security at             Rapid7,       a Boston-based security-data and analytics provider. \u201cThey are designed for vehicles built at a time when the manufacturer assumed there were no vulnerabilities.\u201dAuto makers and suppliers say that those flaws are overstated and that the devices are a good medium-term solution\u2014a bridge to next-generation vehicles, says Mary Gustanski, Delphi\u2019s vice president of engineering and program management.The market for connected-car technology using diagnostic ports is expected to grow to $1.6 billion by 2020 from $160 million in 2013, according to Frost Sullivan, a market-research firm in San Antonio. Insurance companies, which offer dongles to monitor driving patterns in exchange for premium discounts, are expected to connect 27 million vehicles by the end of the decade, Ptolemus Consulting Group estimates.Mr. Dawson is a reporter in The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Detroit bureau.

Or controlling functions like air conditioning by touching the window. Or replacing rearview mirrors with cameras that give you a live-action look at the surrounding traffic.Those are just some of the ideas car makers and designers are kicking around as they imagine a driverless future. When cars can largely navigate roads on their own, there\u2019s no need for the interior design to rigidly follow the model established in the early days of automobiles. The inside of driverless cars might look more like living rooms or meeting places on wheels, with a focus on flexibility and entertainment.Industry officials say fully autonomous and shared-mobility vehicles may be a decade or more away, but increasingly high-tech interiors will start showing up in the next few model years. On the latest luxury-car models, information has begun to move from digital instruments behind the wheel to head-up displays projected on the windshield, so drivers can monitor things like speed and turn-signal indicators without looking down. And other amenities are in the works, such as seats that fully recline or rotate 180 degrees, dashboard ice chests and ambient lighting.\u201cSci-fi is really not fiction anymore\u2014it\u2019s really here,\u201d       Ralph Gilles,        head of design at         Fiat Chrysler Automobiles               NV, said recently at an industry conference. Mr. Giles talked up the idea of cars becoming more of a \u201cthird space\u201d outside the work and home.The idea is showcased in his company\u2019s Portal concept vehicle, featuring removable seats and a retractable steering wheel, which made its debut at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year in Las Vegas.One of the biggest changes on the way is in visual-display technology, which will transform vehicles inside and out, says Carter Cannon, a product manager for electronic integration at International Automotive Components Group.External side-view mirrors will disappear as digital camera images migrate to interior screens, similar to those that rearview cameras use now. And back-seat buttons and switches will move from arm rests to touchscreen-like side windows to control functions such as back-seat air conditioning.\u201cInformation will move above the belt line and become displayed on the glass,\u201d Mr. Cannon told attendees at an industry conference in May. All this will free up the cabin for further design changes.Another design change that promises to radically reshape the driving experience: movable seats. This change may be anything from giving people more-flexible storage options, all the way up to completely remaking the interior of the car to suit different purposes.For an idea of what\u2019s possible, consider a concept car from auto supplier Yanfeng Automotive Interiors, which made its debut at the Detroit auto show earlier this year. The XiM17 (short for \u201cExperience in Motion 2017\u201d) showcased several different seating configurations depending on the mode selected: driving, family, lounge and meeting.The driving mode is fairly standard, but in the other setups, the car retracts the steering wheel and radically reconfigures the cabin. The family mode creates a home-theater experience: The front seats rotate inward and the rear seats slide together into a bench, so that everyone can watch an elongated screen at the center of the dashboard. The screen, about 10 by 36 inches, would be used for instrument displays when not showing movies.\u201cIt\u2019s a living room on wheels,\u201d says David Muyres, an executive director in the North American unit of Yanfeng, in which Chinese auto maker Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. owns a 70% stake through subsidiaries.The XiM17\u2019s meeting mode envisions the car as an extended office. To create space, it collapses the rear seats, rotates the passenger seat 180 degrees and slides the driver\u2019s seat back to the rear. Stowaway trays in a center console provide perches for laptops and can be combined into a single center table.Lounge mode offers an LCD-like screen on the ceiling that can show images while music plays on a multispeaker audio system and LED lights on the floor pulsate and flash to the beat.Other companies are coming up with ways to make sure that passengers will have plenty of snacks for their new home theater or meeting space on wheels. Sweden-based         Dometic Group               AB, which already supplies center-console mini-refrigerators to luxury brands such as Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche, has sketched out concepts for door-mounted bottle coolers, dashboard-embedded ice chests and compact microwave ovens for truck cabins.Of course, there\u2019s a downside to turning cars into entertainment centers or other multiuse spaces: lots of dirt and other messes. Those could be an even bigger problem for one group of self-driving vehicles in particular\u2014those used by shared-mobility services like Uber, which will carry multiple passengers and for more hours of the day.So auto makers will need to come up with carpets and seat cushions that can hold up to greater added wear and tear, and cope with messy one-time riders who have little or no ownership of a particular car. Possible solutions include more-resilient fabrics that can be cleaned easily.\u201cThe interiors of these vehicles are going to have to be puke-proof,\u201d says Ralph Gilles, head of design at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.Already, auto makers are looking to service industries such as airlines and hotels to learn how to better maintain shared spaces. At a recent industry conference, Tim Boundy, an interior-engineering technical fellow at General Motors Co., highlighted the need for \u201codor management\u201d and other solutions.

The U.S. said the ban reflected concerns that terrorists were trying to smuggle bombs on to planes in laptops, tablets and other electronic gear.The European Union has said the U.S. signaled that enhanced security checks could stop the ban from being widened to European airports.Mr. Al Baker, who also runs the Doha hub, said \u201cit would be really impossible for somebody to pass explosives [on board] in their laptops and iPads.\u201d In addition to explosives-detection equipment, processes to check that electronic equipment is functioning would help identify suspect devices, he said.Mr. Al Baker said he would invite representatives from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to review the Doha airport\u2019s security apparatus to help get the ban lifted. \u201cI don\u2019t think this ban will last too long,\u201d he said.More of problem for the Middle East carrier in the near term is the air blockade imposed on Qatar by some its neighbors on the grounds that they needed to isolate the country over its alleged support of terrorism, a charge Doha denies.Countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates imposed the sanctions earlier this month.Mr. Al Baker said all flights are having to be rerouted in and out of Doha. Some as little as five minutes, others up to two hours. He wouldn\u2019t disclose the costs to the airline so far.The Qatar Airways boss voiced frustration international authorities haven't stepped in to force the reopening of airspace.\u201cIt is an absolutely gross violation of international law,\u201d he said. He called it the biggest airspace restriction since the almost yearlong blockage of Berlin that began in June 1948.He called on the International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations air safety arm, to intervene. ICAO has been hosting meetings between representatives of the countries involved to find a compromise. Mr. Al Baker said he was frustrated by the lack of firm action.Mr. Al Baker said the problems wouldn\u2019t force Qatar Airways to defer purchases of new planes.

Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Alex Coppola.Last year, after a decade of growing my advisory business as a solo practitioner, I hit a wall. My ambition to take on new clients was curbed by my capacity to do that work on my own. I needed to bring on another adviser. The problem: I simply couldn\u2019t match the kind of salary and incentives that wirehouses and well-established registered investment advisories were offering their employees.Ultimately, I was able to land the adviser I wanted, not by trying to match or exceed their current salary, but by proposing a different payment structure altogether\u2014compensation based on a percentage of the firm\u2019s gross revenue. Here\u2019s how it happened.I met with a great young adviser who was, at the time, working with another RIA. With experience under his belt, he was now interested in a client-facing role but didn\u2019t want job security or financial success to hinge on client acquisition alone.Both his interests and talents as an adviser made him a great fit for my firm, but I couldn\u2019t come anywhere close to matching his current pay. He politely declined my first offer, and I left the meeting realizing that I needed a different approach.Months later, I heard a podcast with the chief executive of a Silicon Valley tech firm that incentivized employees to help the company grow by allowing them to participate financially in that growth.That idea really struck me. So I went back to the adviser with a new proposal based on revenue sharing. And while it did mean a pay cut in the short term, the adviser liked what that suggested model represented. He welcomed the opportunity to have some skin in the game and appreciated the idea that his work would be driving the direction and success of the business, and subsequently his pay. The harder he worked, the more he could contribute to the efficiency and growth of the firm\u2014and the more he\u2019d profit from it.What\u2019s more, the adviser was attracted to the creative freedom and autonomy the position would provide. By allowing him to develop his strengths without the added pressure of business development, he has quickly become a highly engaged team member who has been instrumental in firm growth.After working through some details, such as putting in a floor and ceiling on annual compensation, the adviser came on board. And so far it\u2019s working well. The goal is to keep building this out with other hires, to find more talented advisers who want to work for clients, each other and the firm.Proposing an unconventional strategy like this requires a willingness to take a risk. When I first broached the subject with the adviser, I was honestly worried about insulting him. But you can\u2019t let that fear hold you back. What I found was that the potential long-term opportunity was more enticing than a lack of short-term compensation. If you are willing to take the chance, if you believe in yourself and your business, I think you\u2019ll find is that people are willing to take a chance on you.", "news_time": "2017-06-19 10:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/to-compete-with-bigger-rivals-an-ria-gets-creative-on-pay-structure-1497880801", "news_title": "To Compete With Bigger Rivals, an RIA Gets Creative on Pay Structure", "keywords": "Taylor Schulte,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,recruitment,workers pay,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "A computer-security company said that a proprietary data set containing personal information on nearly 200 million American voters and their predicted voting behavior was left unprotected online, in a large cache of spreadsheets and other electronic files.According to security company UpGuard, the information, which was available on a public server accessible by anyone via the internet, was compiled by consulting firm Deep Root Analytics, which helps Republican campaigns choose which voters to target with TV advertising.The voter records, which are public information, were augmented with proprietary analysis about voter behavior by Deep Root, which tries to predict voters\u2019 policy preferences and how likely they are to choose a particular candidate.Beyond paying customers, that kind of information could be valuable to rival campaigns or even foreign entities trying to determine how to persuade American voters, according to elections experts.The discovery of the unprotected voter information comes as the integrity of American elections has become a top concern in state capitols and in Washington. Federal investigators and congressional panels are probing Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the 2016 election, and U.S. and state officials have taken steps to safeguard elections from potential hacking and other interference.The information was found on a publicly accessible cloud server, said       Chris Vickery,        an analyst with cybersecurity company UpGuard. He said he discovered the information on June 12 after trying different combinations of letters for web addresses that he thought might point to the information. Mr. Vickery is a specialist in searching for exposed information using this technique, known as \u201ccloud fuzzing,\u201d to help secure sensitive information.The voter information, portions of which were reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, includes the names and other personally identifying information about 198 million registered voters, which would appear to be nearly all of the estimated registered voters in the U.S., the company found. The information includes dates of birth, mailing addresses and party affiliation, as well as self-reported racial demographics, according to Mr. Vickery, but didn\u2019t include social security numbers or financial information.Mr. Vickery, who has a history of discovering sensitive information exposed on the internet, said his most recent find is \u201cquite possibly the biggest I\u2019ve ever had.\u201dIn all, 1.1 terabytes of personal information were found on the server owned by Deep Root Analytics, he said.Registration information about individual voters is available from state and county election boards to anyone who requests it, though compiling it all in one place would take a significant amount of time and labor, and it wouldn\u2019t contain any predictions about voter behavior.In a statement, Deep Root Analytics acknowledged the exposure.The company \u201chas become aware that a number of files within our online storage system were accessed without our knowledge,\u201d the statement said. The company added that \u201cto the best of our knowledge,\u201d the information that was accessed consisted of proprietary analysis \u201cas well as voter data that is publicly available and readily provided by state government offices. Since this event has come to our attention, we have updated the access settings and put protocols in place to prevent further access.\u00a0We take full responsibility for this situation.\u201dDeep Root Analytics said it had hired a cybersecurity firm, Stroz Friedberg, \u201cto conduct a thorough investigation,\u201d adding that \u201cbased on the information we have gathered thus far, we do not believe that our systems have been hacked.\u201dMr. Vickery said that he notified federal authorities and that the information is no longer publicly accessible.In its statement, Deep Root said its initial review showed that the information was accessible because of a \u201crecent change in access settings since June 1,\u201d indicating that the data may not have been accessible before that date.Mr. Vickery said that most of the files he found were updated in mid-January of 2017, but he couldn\u2019t account for whether information was available before when he discovered it earlier this month.The Federal Bureau of Investigation said in the past election cycle there were attempts to hack into state-level voter registration databases, some of them successful, as well as the attempted hacking of at least two companies that help to conduct electronic voting at polling places.Deep Root Analytics\u2019 predictive models tried to account for a range of voters\u2019 political preferences, including how likely someone was to have voted for       Barack Obama       in 2012, to whether someone agreed with President       Donald Trump\u2019s       foreign policy of putting \u201cAmerica first,\u201d and whether they were likely to agree with him on issues related to trade and the U.S. economy, according to UpGuard\u2019s findings.Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election, has questioned whether Russian hackers may have tried to target persuadable voters with manufactured news stories and social media, possibly to tilt them toward voting for the Republican Mr. Trump rather than Democrat       Hillary Clinton.A report by all U.S. intelligence agencies found that the Russian government attempted to influence voters\u2019 opinion, in part through the use of misleading stories on the RT, a Russian state-run English-language media network.The Russian government has repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election.In the 2016 campaign, Deep Root Analytics was paid nearly $1 million by Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign and an allied super PAC, Right to Rise USA, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Several congressional campaigns, including those of former New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, also paid the company, as did two major Republican super PACs linked to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: American Crossroads and Senate Leadership PAC.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and allied super PACs didn\u2019t pay Deep Root Analytics during the 2016 cycle, according to FEC filings.In January 2017, then-Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson designated election infrastructure as critical to the infrastructure of the U.S., placing it under greater scrutiny\u2014and offering the industry greater aid\u2014from the department.But the intended definition of \u201cinfrastructure\u201d extends only to what is managed by a state and used to run elections, said Earl Crane, a former cybersecurity adviser to Mr. Obama and the chief executive of risk management firm Emergent. A political party or campaign would be unlikely to be subject to the Homeland Security designation, unless the analytics were part of the election-day process, he said.\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Write to Shane Harris at shane.harris@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/computer-security-firm-says-voter-data-set-left-unprotected-online-1497877200", "news_title": "Computer-Security Firm Says Voter Data Set Left Unprotected Online ", "keywords": "analyst,computer security,cyber security,files,hacking,internet,pacs,public forum,public information,russian hacking,security breach,spreadsheets,voter data,voter information,voter tendency,Upguard,Chris Vickery,political,general news,crime,legal action,privacy issues,information security,cybercrime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,online,technology"}, {"content": "Amazon is coming to get you no matter where you are. From London to Sydney, investors have interpreted the technology giant\u2019s $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods as a warning shot to local grocers. Yet a more bullish interpretation is also possible: Amazon is coming to buy you.VIEW GraphicFor a deal centered on 430-some stores based mostly in the U.S., Amazon\u2019s bid for             Whole Foods                         has spread collateral damage surprisingly far.

In Europe, shares in Amsterdam-listed Ahold Delhaize plunged almost 10% Friday afternoon, while         Tesco\u2019s       stock fell 5%.Ahold Delhaize makes almost two-thirds of its sales in the U.S., so will be directly affected if Amazon uses Whole Foods to accelerate its U.S. grocery push. For the others any effect is longer-term: The deal simply signals Amazon\u2019s ambitions.But the Whole Foods deal also flags the difficulty of making e-commerce work in food without a store base. If Amazon wants to roll its U.S. strategy out in Europe or Australia, it could buy a local grocer. Admittedly, market leaders like Tesco or Woolworths seem less likely targets than niche players like London-listed Morrison, which already supplies Amazon\u2019s U.K. grocery arm. Morrison shares have risen since the Whole Foods deal broke.Investors have overreacted to this kind of news before. As brokerage         Morgan Stanley               points out, Tesco\u2019s shares fell 15% over the two weeks following         Walmart\u2019s       1999 announcement that it was buying U.K. chain Asda.

GE 0.19%       plans to resume growing its big aircraft-leasing business, ordering more jets and sealing a $2 billion joint venture that will allow it to do additional business with fast-growing airlines in Asia.The company\u2019s GE Capital Aviation Services unit on Monday agreed to buy 120 more Airbus SE and             Boeing Co.        BA 1.27%       jets at the open of the Paris Air Show to add to its fleet of 1,270 owned aircraft. It also agreed to form a partnership with Canada\u2019s Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec in a new venture to acquire narrow-body jets for renting to airlines.Gecas, as the business is known, is the world\u2019s largest jet lessor but has shrunk over the past two years by selling aircraft just as rivals including             AerCap Holdings                   NV and China\u2019s             Bohai Leasing                   have significantly expanded their operations.Rising aircraft-delivery rates have attracted new investors to the industry, notably from Asia, but Gecas Chief Executive       Alec Burger       said there is now an opportunity for the unit to target \u201cmodest growth\u201d and expand its previous order book of 318 aircraft.\u201cWe\u2019re in an industry where there\u2019s more capital and planes than management teams\u201d to handle them, Mr. Burger said in an interview on the eve of the air show. \u201cOur order book is going to go up to historical levels.\u201dOn Monday, Gecas announced a deal for 100 more Airbus A320neo jets and 20 of the new Boeing 737 Max 10 aircraft formally launched at the Paris show.While Gecas has shrunk its assets to about $41 billion, it is also increasingly important for GE\u2019s cash flow because the conglomerate has sold finance assets such as banks and consumer-lending operations after the financial crisis. The venture attracts increased scrutiny from mainstream investors now.\u201cIn our conversations with investors, we find Gecas is generally misunderstood and underappreciated,\u201d said Barclays analysts in a note to clients last week.Mr. Burger, a GE veteran, previously oversaw the reduction of the company\u2019s sizable real-estate portfolio, prompting speculation he would then shrink the aircraft business. Gecas promptly sold dozens of aircraft and slowed new orders, but Mr. Burger said this reflected attractive sale prices and regulatory constraints as GE reduced its finance portfolio.The unit is now the largest in GE Capital and supports the company\u2019s larger aircraft-engine and services portfolio. Some 85% of its aircraft fleet is powered by GE engines\u2014including planes ordered Monday\u2014with much of the repair work steered back to the company.Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t, an infrastructure specialist, has been examining a move into aircraft leasing for several years because of the attractive yields on offer, said Chief Executive       Michael Sabia.The surge of new money entering the industry has since intensified competition for deals such as sale leasebacks, where lessors acquire aircraft from airlines and then rent them back to the carrier.\u201cShort-term pressures are probably there,\u201d said Mr. Sabia, who added that the Canadian company was entering the business for the long haul.The planned joint venture would acquire narrow-body aircraft, the most popular segment of the market, and some deals could be split with existing Gecas operations.Mr. Burger said this would allow Gecas to take advantage of opportunities in China, India and elsewhere in Asia without breaching existing airline and country risk limits.Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 08:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-plans-2-billion-joint-venture-to-build-its-jet-leasing-business-1497864603", "news_title": "GE Returns Jet-Leasing Unit to Growth Mode", "keywords": " aircraft leasing, aircraft lessors, ge airbus,ge aircraft leasing,ge aircraft leasing jv, ge aircraft lessor,ge boeing,ge caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t ,ge caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t jv,ge jet leasing, ge jet leasing jv,pe deals,General Electric,GE,Boeing,BA,Airbus,AIR.FR,FR:AIR,AerCap Holdings,AER,Bohai Financial Investment Holding Co.

For example, a company whose Class A shares in an index control 40% of the total votes might be excluded from FTSE Russell\u2019s main indexes, like the Russell 3000 or Russell 2000, if the threshold were higher than that.FTSE Russell gave until Friday to respond to its proposal. A spokesman said it expects to release a decision sometime in July.The firm asked for feedback on what the threshold might be. It also said it might ultimately decide not to change FTSE Russell rules at all.Nevertheless, the proposal is addressing a corporate governance issue viewed as important to some key investors. \u201cThe future of the markets are at stake,\u201d said       James Andrus,        an investment manager at the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System.Many institutional investors have grown increasingly critical of unequal voting rights. For example, organizations including the Council of Institutional Investors, an advocacy group, have called for nonvoting shares to be banned from indexes.Whether barring companies with unequal voting rights from indexes would prompt them to opt for a different share class structure when going public is uncertain. \u201cThe answer would depend on how restrictive [the ban is], that is how many indexes we were excluded from,\u201d said             Fitbit Inc.       Chief Financial Officer       Bill Zerella       in an email. \u201cWe would have to weigh that with the benefits of a dual class.\u201dFitbit went public in 2015 with Class A shares entitled to one vote and Class B shares entitled to 10 votes.All things being equal, companies that are shifted from popular indexes are likely to see their share prices fall because investors who track the benchmark are no longer required to hold the stock in question. \u201cThere are some studies that show it could make a 15% difference,\u201d Mr. Andrus said.FTSE Russell and two rivals began considering the issue of nonvoting share classes after the March initial public offering of Snap\ufeff                  Inc., whose Class A shares carry no voting rights. The new FTSE Russell proposal broadens that to other kinds of unequal voting shares.And the fact that\u00a0FTSE Russell described a system using thresholds to limit the inclusion of shares with unequal voting rights suggests the firm is likely to do something.\u201cI do think there\u2019s a high likelihood that one of these thresholds will be implemented,\u201d said       Aeisha Mastagni,        a portfolio manager at the California\u00a0State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System. \u201cThe question is what the threshold will be.\u201dFTSE Russell estimated the percentage of voting power held by the public of selected companies that have shares with unequal voting rights. By the firm\u2019s estimates, 38.64% of Alphabet\u2019s voting power is represented by the shares included in its main indexes.For Facebook, 30.27% of total votes are represented by the shares in its main indexes and 59.64% for Ford Motor.Alphabet and Facebook didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment on the proposal or FTSE Russell\u2019s estimates.A Ford spokesman referred to a section of the company\u2019s 2017 proxy statement that says, \u201dOur ownership structure has helped insulate our Company from business cycles and related short-term pressures.\u201dCritics of unequal voting rights are likely to applaud restrictions. \u201cThe mere fact that they are considering keeping nonvoting shares out of the index is a good thing,\u201d said       Charles Elson,        a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware.Kathleen Smith,        co-founder of investment firm Renaissance Capital LLC, said excluding dual voting class companies may result in leaving out superior stock-market performers. \u201cThis could be a minefield,\u201d she said.FTSE Russell, which is owned by         London Stock Exchange Group               PLC, solicited suggestions on what kinds of restrictions should be applied to companies that fail to meet the threshold. All of a company\u2019s securities might be excluded or just nonvoting shares, for example.The firm also sought input on how new restrictions should be applied. The thresholds could be applied at the next review, for example, or existing constituents could be grandfathered into the indexes.Rival index firms S&P Dow Jones Indices and             MSCI                   Inc. also have launched reviews concerning the inclusion of companies with nonvoting shares in their indexes.

PFE 0.78%      : If left alone, AstraZeneca would nearly double its revenue within a decade.Three years into that commitment, Dr. Soriot still has a long way to go to convince investors that walking away from Pfizer was the right call. A series of drug-test successes have lifted AstraZeneca shares this year, bringing them within range of Pfizer\u2019s 2014 offer price. But AstraZeneca has hit some headwinds, including unfavorable currency rates and disappointing results of an attempt to widen the use of one of its new drugs.Dr. Soriot faces his biggest test in coming weeks. Early results for a new lung-cancer treatment could shore up investor confidence in AstraZeneca\u2019s go-it-alone approach\u2014or sow fresh worry. The drugs involved are part of a new breed of cancer medicine called immunotherapies, which boost the immune system\u2019s ability to fight tumors.The trial, dubbed Mystic, \u201cwill be a critical transition point for the company,\u201d said       Jamie Freedman,        who heads the company\u2019s cancer division. \u201cVery soon we\u2019re going to see how that plays out.\u201dThe stakes in such trials are higher for AstraZeneca than most of its Big Pharma peers: It never diversified into fields outside the high risk-reward business of creating new drugs, which succeed or fail after costly development and clinical trials with uncertain outcomes. Drugs that become blockbusters eventually fizzle out when they lose patent protection and face competition from low-cost copycats.Slower but steadier businesses\u2014over-the-counter medicines, personal care products such as toothpaste\u2014have provided a cushion for many of AstraZeneca\u2019s competitors.             GlaxoSmithKline                   PLC engineered a $20-billion deal with             Novartis AG       in 2015 that expanded its vaccines and drugstore-staples businesses while slimming down its prescription-drug arm.When Dr. Soriot came aboard in 2012, AstraZeneca had a near-empty new-drug pipeline and a series of patent expirations that have pressured profit. Last year, annual earnings per share came in at $2.77, down from $7.33 in 2011.Instead of diversifying, Dr. Soriot doubled down on prescription drugs. He prioritized the development of cancer immunotherapies in particular, and embarked on a deal-making spree to stoke the pipeline in oncology treatments and a handful of other disease areas.Earlier this year, Dr. Soriot backtracked a bit from the long-term revenue forecast he made in the heat of the Pfizer approach. Blaming currency fluctuation, he said sales should come in at about $40 billion by 2023, about $5 billion below his earlier promise.Even so, revenue has fallen since that adjusted forecast. Dr. Soriot has long said he expected 2017 to be the year when sales bottomed out\u2014but the decline makes the road to his 10-year target look even steeper.In his 2014 presentation, Dr. Soriot said drugs for respiratory diseases would generate $8 billion in 2023, compared with $4.75 billion generated in 2016. He said he expects AstraZeneca\u2019s diabetes franchise to bring in $8 billion in 2023, versus $2.39 billion last year.Dr. Soriot has tried to position AstraZeneca as an industry leader in cancer treatment. AstraZeneca brought in $3.38 billion last year in that field, compared with $11.5 billion that he estimated such drugs could generate at their peak.There have been some disappointments. The blood-thinning drug Brilinta failed to show positive results in treating peripheral artery disease, making it unlikely the drug would hit its $3.5 billion sales target by 2023, the company said.A spokeswoman said AstraZeneca\u2019s internal revenue forecasts have evolved to reflect clinical-trial successes and setbacks since 2014, and the contribution from each disease area is likely to differ slightly from the forecasts Dr. Soriot laid out when fending off Pfizer.The company declined to disclose the forecast adjustments. Executives have said they remain confident in delivering broadly on 10-year targets, and so far investors remain optimistic, too.AstraZeneca shares are up 19% this year, trading just under \u00a353, or around $67.40, just under the premium-rich \u00a355, or roughly $70, share price Pfizer offered back in 2014.Whether shares can top that offer price\u2014and vindicate Dr. Soriot\u2019s decision to turn it down\u2014depends in the short term on results of the Mystic trial, which is testing whether a combination of two AstraZeneca immunotherapy drugs can prolong survival in advanced lung cancer.Analysts at Jefferies estimate success with Mystic would open the door to an extra $5 billion in revenue at the drug\u2019s peak\u2014nearly half the $11.5 billion Dr. Soriot hopes AstraZeneca\u2019s cancer franchise eventually will generate.With its big investment in drug development, AstraZeneca \u201cmade an overt attempt to reinvent themselves,\u201d said       Jack Scannell,        an analyst at UBS. \u201cMystic is a critical readout on that route.\u201dWrite to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'For AstraZeneca, Cancer Drug Weighs on Go-It-Alone Stand.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-astrazeneca-thrive-on-its-own-big-test-looms-1497873600", "news_title": "Can AstraZeneca Thrive on Its Own?

The business was showing \u201cgreen shoots,\u201d but there was no rush, he told his troops, advocating what he called \u201cdefensive offense.\u201dHis wariness is understandable. A decade of failed reboots and trading blowups has left Morgan Stanley\u2019s fixed-income desk well behind rivals like Goldman and             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. Other turnarounds have shown promise only to crumble.This one is marked by four quarters of fixed-income revenue above $1 billion, Morgan Stanley\u2019s longest streak since 2010. Its market share among the five big U.S. firms has doubled since Mr. Pick was elevated in late 2015 to oversee both stock and debt trading.As the second quarter winds down, Mr. Pick and Morgan Stanley are looking to extend their luck in a tougher environment. Trading revenue across Wall Street is expected to weaken from a year ago, when the U.K. Brexit vote spurred client activity.Morgan Stanley is being careful not to overpromise. Mr. Pick has been telling associates in recent weeks that the division is operating with \u201comentum\u201d\u2014 that is, momentum with an \u201cm\u201d so small it is invisible.\u201cWe are modest in our aspirations, but we have proven this dog can hunt,\u201d Chief Executive       James Gorman       said at a conference Wednesday.A Morgan Stanley lifer with a contrarian streak, Mr. Pick spent seven years running the bank\u2019s stock-trading arm, where he helped rebuild relationships frayed by the firm\u2019s near-collapse during the financial crisis. On his watch, it surpassed Goldman as Wall Street\u2019s biggest by revenue.Currently overseeing 6,000 employees who generate about one-third of the firm\u2019s revenue, the 48-year-old\u00a0New York City native has emerged as a leading contender to succeed Mr. Gorman, who has hinted he would like to remain\u00a0at least a\u00a0few more years.In his rise up the ranks, Mr. Pick won over senior executives for resisting the urge to sugarcoat bad news. As a young equities trader, he became an expert in the firm\u2019s own stock. In the depths of the financial crisis, he would regularly ride the elevator up to the 40th floor at 4 p.m. and update       John Mack,        then CEO, about how shares were trading.Mr. Mack liked to tease Mr. Pick about his penchant for profanity, once playing a trick by having the firm\u2019s compliance department tell Mr. Pick his emails had been flagged for excessive use of expletives, according to people familiar with the episode.He is a newcomer to fixed income, a more varied and fickle business than stock-trading. Ranging from government bonds to complex derivatives contracts, it is one of the biggest fee pots on Wall Street and has been reshaped more than any other business by postcrisis regulations.It has also been a persistent problem child at Morgan Stanley. In 2007, the firm sought emergency financing after a $9 billion losing bet on subprime mortgages. In 2011, it stumbled on Treasurys. Four years later, the culprit was distressed bonds.The firm churned through five fixed-income chiefs in seven years. Some investors urged Mr. Gorman to get out of the business altogether, especially as the CEO\u2019s big push into wealth management\u2014its multiyear purchase of Smith Barney\u2014began to show signs of working.By late 2015, the fixed-income division hit what       Colm Kelleher,        Morgan Stanley\u2019s president, called \u201ca WTF moment.\u201d Morgan Stanley hadn\u2019t found its groove, and globally across banks, fixed-income trading fees were in a tailspin.The firm did a top-to-bottom review of the unit. For an extra set of eyes, it hired consulting firm McKinsey & Co. The consensus: the division was far too big and soaked up too much of Morgan Stanley\u2019s capital, a precious resource since the crisis.In late 2015, the firm promoted Mr. Pick to oversee the combined sales and trading operation. He brought along       Sam Kellie-Smith,        a British options trader who had been his deputy in equities, to run the fixed-income group.The pair swiftly fired 25% of the unit\u2019s traders, cutting deep in European credit trading, where activity had slowed, and foreign-exchange, where electronic trading had gutted fees. They preserved more staffing in interest rates and U.S. credit,\u00a0and combined equities and fixed-income sales teams to squeeze more business out of hedge fund clients.Tighter risk-management also improved returns. Risk-weighted assets in the unit have fallen since late 2015 by about 30%. Executives have also reduced \u201cslippage\u201d on bond trades, which refers to price moves between when an order is placed and when it is executed.The firm did get some outside help too, specifically \u201cwhen the markets started to kick up a little bit\u201d and some European rivals pulled back from debt trading, Mr. Gorman said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get excited until it really happens over a couple-of-year period.\u201dWrite to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Colm Kelleher is Morgan Stanley\u2019s president.

Several directives will no longer apply to the U.K. and that will impact both British and             Continental                   European firms.There have been pledges from the British government to limit friction. \u201cWe have the interests of both the British business community and all the international companies right at the center of our attention as we go into these negotiations,\u201d said       Kim Darroch,        the country\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., during last week\u2019s CFO Network Annual Meeting.Still, after an unexpected election outcome\u2014Prime Minister       Theresa May       earlier this month lost her majority in the House of Commons\u2014Brexit talks are set to begin this week.\u201cWe are concerned about tax changes,\u201d said       Mark Wilson,        finance chief at British luxury car maker Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd. \u201cWe are trying to assess the implications of this, but it is very difficult,\u201d he said.Aston Martin has estimated the financial impact of the changes, but declined to publicly state them. The company said it would take it one or two years to be compliant with amended tax rules. \u201cThere will be frictional costs associated with this,\u201d said Mr. Wilson.Seadrill Management Ltd., a U.K.-based deep-water drilling contractor also expects changes to its tax obligations. However, it is too early to say what these will look like, said Matthew Rose, vice president of Seadrill\u2019s tax unit.\u201cThis will need to be assessed when the terms of the EU-exit are better known,\u201d       Mr. Rose       said.Moving money between entities in different countries could also become more costly.Current regulations, according to which dividend payments from other EU countries aren\u2019t taxed in the U.K., could no longer apply after Brexit. Where there is now no withholding tax on dividend payments, there might be a 5% tax after Brexit.It is likely that Britain\u2019s separation from the EU also means that the country drops out of the current value-added tax regime. \u201cThat causes problems for manufacturers, the car industry, virtually everybody that deals with goods across borders,\u201d said       Richard Asquith,        vice president of Avalara Inc.\u2019s indirect tax business. Although VAT can be recovered, it takes time, and is a cash flow risk, Mr. Asquith said.Aston Martin said that VAT will be one of the biggest challenges, besides customs duties. Even now, with the U.K. still a member of the EU, reclaiming VAT is difficult, Mr. Wilson said.Changes to VAT will also impact U.S. firms. The so called \u2018mini one-stop shop\u2019 system which requires digital services companies to register in one EU country only to benefit from the union\u2019s current VAT-regulation is likely to cease post-Brexit. U.S. firms that in the past chose the U.K. as a location for this will have to re-register in an EU country.About 12,000 U.S. companies could be affected, Mr. Asquith said. For larger businesses, the changes could result in extra costs of around \u20ac300,000 ($335,300), as functions such as accounting, billing and enterprise resource management have to be adjusted.Some experts have suggested there could be further reductions in the corporate tax rate. The U.K.\u2019s corporate tax is set to fall to 17% in 2020. That could offset some of the negative tax effects of Brexit, according to       Michael Wistow,        co-head of the EMEA tax practice at White & Case LLP.Write to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 07:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/finance-chiefs-struggle-to-narrow-down-impact-of-post-brexit-tax-changes-1497863702", "news_title": "Finance Chiefs Struggle to Narrow Down Impact of Post-Brexit Tax Changes", "keywords": "brexit,brexitinset ,chief financial officers,eu fiscal rules,european union,finance chiefs,taxation,taxes,regulation,government policy,corporate funding,corporate,industrial news,corporate taxation,political,general news,personal finance,tax strategies"}, {"content": "Twitter        TWTR 0.70%       is kicking off a new advertising effort this week to showcase its users\u2019 diverse array of viewpoints, in the hopes of drumming up more interest in its platform and maintaining its recent acceleration in user growth.The TV ad, which will be begin airing Monday, shows hip-hop artist Chance the Rapper asking his fans via Twitter for song requests for his upcoming concert. His tweet sets off a wide range of responses, not all positive, as people tweet back and debate selections. Musical legend David Crosby is seen tweeting: \u201cHow about something with real instruments.\u201dTwitter Chief Marketing Officer       Leslie Berland       said the new ad campaign is intended to show people how Twitter is \u201cunique\u201d compared with other social-media sites. Users can actually \u201csee different perspectives\u201d on Twitter, she said, \u201cwhether it be a journalist, a citizen, a celebrity or an artist.\u201d Sites like             Facebook                   have faced criticism, particularly on the heels of the U.S. presidential election, for reinforcing people\u2019s \u201cbubbles\u201d and not exposing users to broader perspectives.The ad push is the next step in Twitter\u2019s ongoing attempt to better explain to consumers what Twitter is and why it\u2019s valuable to spend time on the platform.The social-media company reported its average monthly active users rose 6% in the first quarter to 328 million. It was the largest quarterly increase since 2015 and partly due to \u201cnew and resurrected users following more news and political accounts\u201d in the U.S., the company said during its earnings call. Although the company didn\u2019t specifically call out President Donald Trump, his frequent tweeting has garnered world-wide attention for the platform.Continuing to stimulate more consumer engagement is critical for Twitter, as it tries to grow its ad business, which has been stagnant. Twitter posted its first quarterly decline in revenue since going public in 2013, during the quarter ended in March.The new campaign, which carries the tagline #SeeEverySide, is expected to run for several months and includes a TV commercial and online ads that will appear across the web including on rival sites such as Instagram, Facebook and YouTube.Last year, the San Francisco company began trying to clear up the misconceptions people had about what the platform is used for with ads that showed how Twitter lets people know what is happening in the worlds of sports, politics and entertainment.To address its biggest challenge of drawing more eyeballs, Twitter has also been making its platform more accessible through product redesigns, such as showing people more relevant tweets at the top of their timelines. Last week, it revealed a new design, which made it faster and easier to use and included adding bolder headlines and new icons.It\u2019s also sought to broaden its audiences by streaming live videos from major sports leagues like the NBA. Earlier this year, it announced a long list of new video deals with partners, including the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association, concert promoter             Live Nation                   and Bloomberg.Getting users to spend more time on the platform is critical for the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to convince advertisers to spend more of their marketing dollars with Twitter.It\u2019s a tough task for anyone in the digital space, as Google and Facebook continue to suck up a big portion of the ad dollars thanks, in part, to their massive audiences.Google is expected to command 40.7% of the $83 billion U.S. digital ad market this year, while Facebook should account for about 19.7% of the market, eMarketer estimates. Meanwhile, Twitter is expected to lose share and have 1.6% of the total business, the research firm said.Twitter declined to say how much it will spend on its new marketing push.Its ad spending in the U.S. has historically paled in comparison to rivals. Last year, Twitter spent $9.2 million on advertising in the U.S., while Facebook shelled out $80.7 million and LinkedIn spent $22.8 million, according to estimates from Kantar Media.Even though its ad budget does dwarf rivals, Twitter said its brand gets a big boost from the media attention that the platform receives nowadays. \u201cMore and more reporters are embedding tweets in their stories,\u201d Ms. Berland pointed out.Write to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 07:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-a-new-ad-campaign-help-twitter-maintain-its-trump-bump-1497870004", "news_title": "Can a New Ad Campaign Help Twitter Maintain its Trump Bump?", "keywords": "Twitter,TWTR,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,social media marketing,usage,consumption statistics,blogging,political,general news,concerts,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,music,social media,tv advertising,public relations,business,consumer services,internet,online,media,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "SEOUL\u2014South Korea said it would scrap plans to build new nuclear-power plants and halt operation of the country\u2019s oldest reactor, marking a shift for a nation that ranks among the most reliant on atomic energy.President       Moon       Jae-in, the left-leaning leader elected last month, said Monday that he would permanently end operations at the Kori-1 reactor, which went online in 1978, at midnight on Sunday.\u201cThe permanent shutdown of the Kori-1 nuclear reactor is the first step towards a nuclear-free state and a paradigm shift to a safer Korea,\u201d Mr. Moon said. \u201cI will review nuclear-reactor policy in full measure and scrap all the existing plans to build new nuclear reactors and will not extend the lifespan of current ones.\u201dThe move fulfills a campaign pledge to review nuclear policy and expand renewable energy. In addition, Mr. Moon said the government would close 10 outdated coal power plants and halt construction of new ones.South Korea\u2019s decision is the latest blow to nuclear power in developed nations. The triple meltdown at Japan\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear-power plant in March 2011 led German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       to order a gradual end to nuclear power in her country.In Japan, where nuclear power once accounted for 30% of electricity production, only a handful of reactors have restarted since stricter regulations were introduced after the Fukushima accident. And in the U.S., the availability of inexpensive natural gas has hit the competitiveness of nuclear power, leading utilities to close nuclear plants at a rapid clip.The skepticism has spread to developing nations. In November, Vietnam scrapped plans for its first nuclear-power plants. Safety concerns and the high cost of protecting against accidents have limited the appeal of what once looked like an inexpensive electricity source.Defenders of nuclear power observe that it is a carbon-free source of energy and can operate 24 hours a day, while renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind can produce power only some of the time.South Korea has 25 nuclear reactors, which produce about 30% of the country\u2019s power supply, according to Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. Many were built near densely populated cities in the country\u2019s south.To make up for the energy shortfall in a country plagued by summer brownouts and blackouts in recent years, Mr. Moon said that the government would foster renewables, including solar and wind power, and develop liquefied natural gas as a new energy source.The president\u2019s plan, however, faces some hurdles.Seong Poong-hyun, professor of nuclear and quantum engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, said in a weekend newspaper column that renewables couldn\u2019t yet provide large amounts of electricity.Professors who are members of Korea Atomic Industrial Forum and the Korean Nuclear Society released a report on June 8 emphasizing safety and efficiency of nuclear plants and arguing the case for a continued role for nuclear power.Mr. Moon said nuclear was an obvious choice for a developing country heavily reliant on energy imports during the 1970s and 1980s, but that South Korea had to move on to clean and sustainable energy.Environmentalists welcomed Monday\u2019s announcement.

It\u2019s the largest venture fund raised to date, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.The new fund, which closed at its hard cap, is just larger than NEA\u2019s last pool of $3.15 billion in 2015, which included a $2.85 billion main fund and a $350 million opportunity fund for investing in growth stage companies.NEA\u2019s new 16th fund continues a trend of strong fundraising among venture capital firms, as limited partners seek to find growth in new emerging startups. Venture-capital fundraising had a near record-setting year with $44 billion raised last year, only second to the dot-com era mania, though fundraising cooled slightly in the first quarter of this year.Menlo Park, Calif.- and Chevy Chase, Maryland-based NEA has not finished investing out of its opportunity fund, and it hasn\u2019t decided if it will raise another one, said       Scott Sandell,        managing general partner at NEA. The firm has already started investing out of the new main fund.With the new fund, Mr. Sandell has become the sole managing general partner as part of NEA\u2019s long-planned generational leadership transition. In its previous fund, Mr. Sandell joined       Peter Barris       as co-managing general partner. Now, as planned, Mr. Barris is becoming chairman and remains a general partner. Dick Kramlich, who was chairman, is now chairman emeritus.NEA, a multistage investor in technology and health care startups, has invested in companies such as Jet.com, Data Domain, Fusion-io, Opower, Opendoor, Desktop Metal and             Tableau Software.Among its many areas of interest, there\u2019s particular recent focus on genetics-related startups in healthcare, with prices for sequencing genomes dropping rapidly. Secondly, the firm has looked at startups jumping on the move from online to offline, such as mattress company Casper, a portfolio company. The use of technology tools are transforming previously offline industries, Mr. Sandell said.\u201cThere is this tool kit that is changing the physics of innovation and company-building in a literal sense,\u201d Mr. Sandell said.NEA did a survey and found that its startups are affecting 36 different industries, Mr. Sandell said.Finally, rapid advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence are affecting every software and cloud-related startup, he added.NEA\u2019s 2009 vintage Fund 13 had an internal rate of return of 18.82%, as of September 30, 2016, according to data posted by the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, a limited partner.In addition to Mr. Sandell and Mr. Barris, NEA\u2019s general partners are       Forest Baskett,       Tony Florence,       Mohamad Makhzoumi,        Josh Makower,       Dave Mott,       Chetan Puttagunta,       Jon Sakoda,       Pete Sonsini       and       Ravi Viswanathan.Write to Tomio Geron at tomio.geron@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 07:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nea-raises-massive-3-3-billion-fund-1497871803", "news_title": "NEA Raises Massive $3.3 Billion Fund", "keywords": "political,general news,charities,philanthropy,society,community,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities,venture capital"}, {"content": "Good morning from a hot and sunny Cannes on the French Riviera, as the annual advertising extravaganza gets underway. Snap is an early candidate for stealing the show, having bettered last year\u2019s giant billboard by erecting a Snapchat-branded ferris wheel right in the heart of the action outside the Palais. It looks like the last thing many of the jaded and slightly glazed faces I\u2019ve seen this morning will want to be jumping on. Remember: It\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint.So what will Adland be debating on stage and discussing over copious amounts of ros\u00e9 this year? We\u2019ve got you covered with The Wall Street Journal\u2019s special report: \u201cThe Ad Maze.\u201d I\u2019ll highlight stories from it today and tomorrow so you\u2019ll have some talking points to see you through your important meetings all week. (It will be published in print on Tuesday as a special section of WSJ.) The Journal\u2019s Suzanne Vranica has the lowdown on marketers\u2019 latest efforts to keep their brands safe online. Colgate, for example, is adding new language to the contract with its ad-buying firm that requires it to maintain blacklists. Meanwhile, \u201cprogrammatic direct\u201d deals and the use of private marketplaces are on the rise as brands such as Target and Hewlett Packard Enterprise shift from more risky open exchanges. My big Cannes prediction? Ad fraud prevention and ad verification firms are going to be making a whole lotta dough this week.Google and Facebook have their usual spots on the beach again this year. Adland\u2019s wish for a third player to truly compete with the so-called \u201cduopoly\u201d of online advertising is bound to be a big topic among Cannes attendees. I wrote a feature for \u201cThe Ad Maze\u201d looking at who could reasonably be in the running for No. 3. Snap brings young audiences to the table, while Verizon\u2019s new Oath unit (the union of AOL and Yahoo) has high hopes. Amazon has been somewhat restrained until now, but there\u2019s no telling when it will take a big dive into a new business, as it just did with its Whole Foods acquisition on Friday. Big Chinese players including Alibaba and Tencent also want a slice of the action -- and already have a larger share of the global digital ad market than the aforementioned U.S. players, as Jack Marshall reports.--Dollar Dollar Bill--This is as good a way as any to understand Google and Facebook\u2019s dominance right now.Publicis Groupe\u2019s new CEO Arthur Sadoun enters his first Cannes as the boss with a new vision for the company -- \u201cBreak. Bond. Build\u201d -- which the agency group teased in an insider-jokey video that promises a \u201crendezvous\u201d of some kind tomorrow. Speaking of bonding, Publicis also announced a tie-up with Alibaba that\u2019ll give its clients access to the tech giants\u2019 assets in China.--Sadoun Q&A--Suzanne Vranica caught up with Madison Avenue\u2019s newest power player for the \u201cAd Maze\u201d package. Mr. Sadoun thinks one of the biggest threats to ad companies is \u201cfragmentation that makes marketing splintered.\u201d It\u2019s a challenge that\u2019s close to home. He also went on to say that Publicis\u2019 recent write-down of Sapient came partly because it\u2019s tricky to get technologists and marketing people to work together. Some other key facts we dug out: Mr. Sadoun is a cat person, not a dog person, and he\u2019s a towering 6\u2019 5\u201d.Twitter has called on Chance the Rapper to lead a new ad campaign that shows off the site\u2019s ability to allow a range of people to share their points of view, CMO Today reports. In the TV spot, Chance the Rapper asks his fans for song requests via Twitter and while he receives a flood of positive feedback, there\u2019s some mockery thrown in too. \u201cHow about something with real instruments,\u201d David Crosby, of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young fame, tweets.--Twitter\u2019s new user grab--Last quarter, Twitter beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates when it came to adding new users, but ad revenue declined year-on-year for the first time since it became a public company. Twitter needs to keep its user base growing if it is to keep its ad business healthy. This ad is the latest in a series of marketing efforts designed to do just that and explain to people why they\u2019d want to use the service. Enlisting Chance the Rapper in the lead role certainly elevates Twitter\u2019s cool status, but might the company be preaching to the converted here? Chance the Rapper, who is perhaps best known for consistent refusal to sign with a record label, practically wrote the textbook on cultivating a fanbase using social media.McDonald\u2019s and the International Olympic Committee have ended their partnership three years before their existing deal was set to expire. The fast food chain, which has had a relationship with the Olympics since the late \u201860s, said it was \u201creconsidering all aspects of our business\u201d as part of its global growth plan and that the pair mutually agreed to part ways.

Seven U.S. sailors were killed in the weekend disaster.While the incidents are 32 years apart and may have different causes, they highlight questions over safety in one of Japan\u2019s busiest maritime regions. Yokosuka, home to the U.S. Navy\u2019s Seventh Fleet, sits at the entrance to Tokyo Bay, home to the major ports of Yokohama and Tokyo.On Monday, a U.S. Coast Guard investigation team arrived in Japan to begin working on a safety probe into the latest collision. The U.S. Navy is holding a separate investigation into the cause of the incident, while Japan\u2019s coast guard and Transport Safety Board have launched their own investigations.Officials on both sides declined to provide initial assessments on the cause of the collision.The cargo ship involved in the weekend accident, the ACX Crystal, finished unloading its cargo of containers on Monday in the port of Yokohama, officials from the ship\u2019s owner,             Nippon Yusen K.K.      , said. They added that damage to the front of the vessel would likely be repaired.The U.S. Navy and Nippon Yusen declined to make crew members from either ship available for interviews.The collision from December 1985 occurred around one mile outside Yokosuka harbor, according to an Associated Press report from the time. The USS Lockwood sustained a hole 25 feet wide in front of the bridge on its right side. Three sailors sprained their backs and one broke his ankle, according to the report.The U.S. Navy didn\u2019t immediately respond to an emailed question about the result of the investigation into the 1985 incident.John Durkin, a former crew member of the USS Lockwood who had been transferred off the ship shortly before the accident, said that the captain was immediately relieved from his position.\u201cIn the Navy it doesn\u2019t matter whose fault it is, the captain is responsible,\u201d Mr. Durkin said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s a very strong culture of responsibility,\u201d he said.Warren Hudson, the captain of the USS Lockwood at the time of the 1985 incident, declined to comment.\u2014Chieko Tsuneoka contributed to this article.Write to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Navy Collision Similar to 1985 Event.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 07:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-uss-fitzgerald-disaster-signs-of-history-repeating-1497870386", "news_title": "In USS Fitzgerald Disaster, Signs of History Repeating ", "keywords": " accident, collision, japan, ship,us navy, uss fitzgerald,Japan's coast guard,U.S.,Navy,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,navy,transport accidents,transport"}, {"content": "While Georgia\u2019s House special election Tuesday is a test of whether Republicans will cross party lines to support a Democrat, another contest the same day in South Carolina aims to measure a different proposition: Can a white Democrat drive enough black voter turnout to score an upset.The race is to replace former Rep.       Mick Mulvaney,        who President       Donald Trump       tapped to serve as his budget director. Archie Parnell, a former Goldman Sachs executive, is running on the Democratic ticket against Republican Ralph Norman, who narrowly advanced from a GOP primary race.With Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings at historic lows and Democrats showing double-digit gains in turnout during two prior unsuccessful House special elections, South Carolina Democrats have spent recent weeks trying to build a machine to turn out the district\u2019s African-American voters.Black voters represent 28% of the district but typically are a far smaller percentage of the electorate. To win, former South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison said, black turnout\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0must be 35% or more of the electorate.\u201cWe know how loyal this community is to the Democratic Party,\u201d Mr. Harrison said. \u201cThe question is: How do you get people interested enough to vote?\u201dSouth Carolina\u2019s is the first post-Trump congressional election with a large bloc of black voters. Few African-Americans live in Montana or Kansas, and just 12% of voters in the Georgia district that votes\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0are black.If Mr. Parnell, a 66-year-old former tax adviser who was born and raised in the district but has lived away from it for most of his adult life, can drive large numbers of African-Americans to vote for him, Democrats may have found another road map to victory in the 2018 midterm elections.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the biggest outside contributor to the race, has spent $275,000 to test a host of messages aimed at driving black voters to the polls. The results, officials say, will inform Democratic turnout efforts in African-American communities in the 2018 elections.\u201cWe\u2019re aiming to try to get out 40,000 voters from the African-American community, and with that we\u2019d be in a good place to win,\u201d Mr. Parnell said. \u201cNo one knows how many people are going to vote. Whether we\u2019ll be successful, time will tell.\u201dMr. Parnell has spent his 15-week campaign in black churches, barber shops and community events arguing that Mr. Trump is reversing the legacy of President       Barack Obama.       He speaks regularly about the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for diabetes and heart disease, ailments that\u00a0disproportionately\u00a0affect the black community, and the high incarceration rate of black South Carolinians.\u201cThere is more excitement and more activity regarding this election than we\u2019ve had in a long time,\u201d said Melvin Poole, a former president of the NAACP chapter in Rock Hill, S.C.Republicans remain confident the district\u2019s voters are sufficiently conservative to make it unwinnable for any Democrat. Twice as many Republicans as Democrats voted in their respective primary elections last month, though Mr. Parnell faced two opponents with few financial resources.Mr. Norman, a former state legislator who is on his third run for Congress, won a runoff election for the GOP nomination by 220 votes against a moderate Republican. He said he doesn\u2019t expect his margin of victory to approach Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s during his last two elections.\u201cThe 18 to 20-point margins he had, mine won\u2019t be close to that,\u201d said Mr. Norman, who is backed by the conservative Club for Growth. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy with seven, eight or nine percent.\u201dWhile the Georgia race has attracted more than $60 million\u2014a record for a House race -- South Carolina\u2019s campaign budget befits the race\u2019s low-key status.Mr. Norman has raised $1.3 million, including $495,000 of his own money. Mr. Parnell\u2019s campaign has raised $763,000, including $205,000 from the candidate. The National Republican Congressional Committee has $135,000 to turnout GOP voters and the Congressional Leadership Fund, the House GOP leadership super PAC, spent $50,000 on calls to 45,000 Republicans reminding them to vote.There is little reliable public polling of the South Carolina district, which covers parts of 11 counties from Columbia to the suburbs of Charlotte on the North Carolina border.Democratic candidates in Montana and Kansas came within six and 7 percentage points in special elections this spring for House seats in districts Republicans won by 31 and 16 points last November.Mr. Parnell and his allies are hoping for another Democratic surge and depressed GOP turnout. Democrats outside of South Carolina see a single-digit margin as another sign of the party\u2019s progress during the Trump era.But Mr. Norman said Republicans he has spoken with remain motivated to vote. Last week\u2019s shooting of Republican members of Congress at a baseball practice drew more attention to gun rights, he said, and will draw conservative voters to the polls\u00a0Tuesday.Mr. Trump, who recorded a robocall urging voters to \u201cvote Republican for Congress,\u201d doesn\u2019t appear to be as much of a drag on the Norman campaign as he appeared to be for Republicans running elsewhere.\u201cHe\u2019s very popular,\u201d Mr. Norman said of the president. \u201cI trust him and I think he\u2019s got the country on the right course.\u201dWrite to Reid J.

The U.S. military said it had shot down the Syrian SU-22 after regime forces twice attacked U.S.-backed Syrian fighters leading the assault on Raqqa, Islamic State\u2019s self-declared capital. With the strike, the U.S. military made it clear it was now willing to target Syrian regime jets to protect the coalition of Kurdish and Arab fighters working with U.S. special-operation forces to push Islamic State from Raqqa.

Amazon\u2019s deal to buy Whole Foods could add to the saturated market as it puts more of its own groceries into the distribution system, while putting new pressure on grocers to figure out how to sell fresh food online lest the web giant beat them. However, it isn\u2019t at all clear whether the king of e-commerce can do in fresh cabbages what it has done in books, compact discs and just about everything else. Amazon and Whole Foods combined would still have a fraction of Wal-Mart\u2019s share of groceries. Also, Amazon faces a \u201clast mile\u201d logistics problem of getting fresh food to doorsteps. The deal unites two maverick businessmen who will now have to blend very distinct approaches.This Tuesday\u2019s U.S. House special election in Georgia has turned into a defining clash between the two political parties, with both sides targeting a new cadre of potential swing voters: Republicans uneasy with the rise of President Trump.

The $13.7 billion purchase gives Amazon hundreds of stores in prime urban locations that could serve as beachheads for in-store pickup and its distribution network. The WSJ\u2019s Laura Stevens and Annie Gasparro report it would make Amazon an overnight heavyweight in the $674 billion grocery business. That segment is changing as consumers ramp up purchases online and a new generation of startups remake food delivery to homes. Online grocery distribution is logistically complex, often requiring fast delivery of cold items as part of large orders on routes where stops are spread far apart. Amazon has struggled to gain a foothold there because it has a meager physical presence and shoppers still largely prefer to shop for food in stores, giving Amazon little opportunity until now to spread its costs across a broader network.In adding Whole Foods to its business, Amazon may be gaining critical new nodes for its distribution network. Adding more than 430 stores, most of them in high-income, densely-populated areas, will give the online giant sites perfectly positioned to serve as pickup and delivery hubs for urban customers, WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Erica E. Phillips and Jennifer Smith write. Amazon has been building out a network of urban warehouses, sites that are far smaller than the company\u2019s sprawling distribution centers on the outskirts of cities and that are aimed at providing one- or two-hour delivery to its Prime Now customers. Now, Amazon will have real estate to expand its neighborhood network by a factor of at least five. It also brings Amazon access to the Whole Foods refrigerated storage areas\u2014potentially saving significant costs. One outstanding question will be whether Amazon seeks to change relationships with Whole Foods\u2019 suppliers, many of them niche providers with limited distribution networks.One of the biggest players in the logistics mergers-and-acquisitions marketplace is back in the hunt for new targets.         XPO Logistics Inc.       CEO       Bradley Jacobs       says the company is again looking for acquisitions, WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Jennifer Smith writes, after taking nearly two years off to digest the numerous purchases that made XPO the fastest growing logistics operator in North America. XPO has put its time on the sidelines to work: the company has reported four straight profitable quarters and its stock price has more than doubled in the past year, signaling growing investor confidence that XPO can deliver efficiencies and growth from its many additions. Mr. Jacobs says he\u2019s most interested in larger targets, although the company may look at smaller, strategic targets. That could help revive logistics M&A activity that\u2019s been mostly quiet since a series of big buys that consolidated the logistics market in 2015.Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       keeps adding pieces to its growing online business while the retailer\u2019s biggest competitor tries to transform the e-commerce landscape. Minutes after Amazon\u2019s blockbuster deal was announced, Wal-Mart completed a $310 million purchase of online menswear retailer Bonobos, the WSJ\u2019s Sarah Nassauer and Imani Moise report, the latest in a series of small acquisitions aimed at remaking Wal-Mart\u2019s web sales presence. The purchase gives Wal-Mart access to a brand that exists primarily online, as well as talent: Bonobos founder Andy Dunn will head Wal-Mart\u2019s efforts to build online, direct-to-consumer brands. The buys of niche online chains such as Bonobos and Moosejaw chains that appeal to wealthier or more fashion-forward shoppers are aimed at helping Wal-Mart reach beyond its core customers. Wal-Mart has also ramped up efforts to use its stores to ship online orders, but it\u2019s unclear whether the company will try to blend the supply chains of its new acquisition targets with its broader network of big-box stores.General Motors Co.       is starting to reroute parts of its North American supply chain from Mexico to the U.S. The automaker is opening a supplier park near its Arlington, Texas, sport-utility factory, bringing some 600 jobs and a higher concentration of American-made parts in Chevrolet Suburbans and Cadillac Escalades. GM is one of several manufacturers rethinking the wisdom of shipping intermediate products through far-flung supply chains, the WSJ\u2019s Mike Colias and William Mauldin report. Global parts networks have long been seen as critical to cutting costs, but more companies are concluding they\u2019re a risky bet due to political shifts, protectionist measures and natural disasters. The auto maker says its new move was planned before President       Donald Trump       criticized GM\u2019s Mexican imports, and the new supplier park will trim logistics expenses and bring other gains from proximity of parts to the assembly plant.American agriculture exporters are already feeling the impact of friction between the U.S. and Mexico over trade. Mexican imports of farm commodities including corn, soybean meal and chicken are in steep decline, the WSJ\u2019s Jacob Bunge reports, signaling that Mexico is buying food from a wider range of countries and reducing reliance on the U.S. That\u2019s rippling across American farms: Mexico is the third-largest customer for U.S.-produced farm goods overall, accounting for $18 billion in trade last year, and it\u2019s the No. 1 customer for corn. Mexico\u2019s declining purchases of some commodities runs counter to the Trump administration\u2019s goal to boost U.S. exports generally, as the White House moves to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement in a bid to revive U.S. manufacturing. Now, however, U.S. officials worry the uncertainly around trade could jeopardize a market that last year bought roughly 13% of total U.S. agricultural exports.\u2018Amazon views grocery as one of the most important long-term drivers of growth in its retail segment.\u2019Share of U.S. grocery sales made online last year, according to Kanter Retail.Authorities are investigating the collision between a U.S. naval destroyer and an NYK container ship near Japan that left seven American sailors dead.

It is expected in the next few weeks.Wake vortices\u2014high-velocity, whirling airflow spinning off wingtips\u2014spread downward and backward, so offsetting laterally by a mile or two from the planned route typically avoids the brunt of the turbulence.Another portion of the European Aviation Safety Agency\u2019s anticipated, nonbinding bulletin, these officials said, will warn pilots that when they encounter wake at cruise altitude they should avoid prematurely disconnecting the autopilot and refrain from making big manual inputs on the controls.\u201cIt\u2019s close, and we\u2019re now finalizing the draft,\u201d said a person familiar with the details.In a January incident that has garnered considerable global attention, a             Bombardier Inc.       business jet temporarily went out of control and plunged some 9,000 feet over the Arabian Sea after an             Airbus                   A380 superjumbo jet flying in the opposite direction passed 1,000 feet overhead. Two passengers were severely injured on the business jet, which suffered severe damage, investigators determined.\u2018The real question is how much of the consequences of such events are actually triggered by the wake, and how much are triggered by improper pilot reaction.\u2019The A380 was flying on its designated route and continued to its destination without its pilots realizing what had occurred.Without discussing specifics of the accident or the bulletin,       Andrea Boiardi,        a former airline captain who now works as an operational safety expert for EASA, sketched out the controversial nature of the issue last week on the sidelines of an international safety conference in Brussels.\u201cThe real question is how much of the consequences of such events are actually triggered by the wake, and how much are triggered by improper pilot reaction,\u201d he said.The proper response to wake encounters en route is expected to be a topic of discussion among safety experts attending the Paris Air Show here this week.A preliminary report by investigators found the Bombardier Challenger was cruising normally at 34,000 feet before the wake encounter. Over the next 34 seconds it rolled several times, its left engine overheated and was temporarily shut down and speed and flight-control commands changed abruptly. The crew declared an emergency and landed safely about two hours later.Airbus A380 wake turbulence was a major safety topic before the double-decker jet started commercial service in 2007. The issue has been revived in recent years as minimum vertical separations between aircraft have been reduced.Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 06:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/air-safety-authorities-focus-on-wake-as-bigger-jets-fly-closer-together-1497866482", "news_title": "Air-Safety Authorities Focus on Wake as Bigger Jets Fly Closer Together", "keywords": "air accidents,aircraft safety,aircraft turbulence,airline safety,jet wakes,turbulence,wake vortices,European Aviation Safety Agency,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,airplane accidents,political,general news,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,transport accidents,transport,aerospace products,parts,civil aircraft,airlines,aerospace,defense,air transport,industrial goods,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "Top executives from the tech industry are coming to the White House on Monday for meetings aimed at updating federal computer systems, part of a push to save money, guard against cyberattacks and make government websites easier to use.Executives including             Amazon.com Inc.       Chief Executive       Jeff Bezos,        Apple Inc. CEO       Tim Cook       and             Microsoft Corp.       CEO       Satya Nadella       are expected to attend and spend hours in small working groups before meeting with President       Donald Trump       to talk about their conclusions.Discussing the conference with reporters last week, White House officials said one goal is to give people who use government services a more satisfying experience rivaling that of such private-sector companies as Amazon.A memo sent to the executives in advance of the meeting mentioned that applying for government benefits should be as easy as depositing \u201ca check on your phone.\u201dOther companies sending top executives to the White House include             Oracle Corp.      ,             Mastercard Inc.,       Google parent Alphabet Inc. and             International Business Machines Corp.Modernizing government technology could save as much as $1 trillion in part by replacing balky and outmoded systems that are difficult to maintain, officials said.The concerns aren\u2019t new, nor are efforts to address them. Former President       Barack Obama       also sought to upgrade computer systems, warning that outdated technology raised the risk of cyberattack.A report last year from the U.S. Government Accountability Office said some agencies are relying on \u201cobsolete\u201d parts and programming language that dates back to the 1950s. The Defense Department was using 8-inch floppy disks in a system that coordinates operations of U.S. nuclear forces, the report said.Heading the White House effort are       Jared Kushner,        the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser who leads the newly created White House Office of American Innovation; and       Chris Liddell,        a former Microsoft executive and now an assistant to the president.\u201cOur systems are in some cases 10 to 20 years out of date,\u201d Mr. Liddell told reporters. \u201cSo we\u2019re not going to fix that in one day. But we want to start now.\u00a0 And this day will be a significant one in terms of generating ideas and potential solutions to the problems.\u201dThe conference kicks off a week that White House officials said will emphasize technology. Hoping to keep a spotlight on its agenda, the White House of late has been setting weekly themes built around specific policy goals. Last week, the theme was workforce development; the week before that, infrastructure.The conference Monday is the latest instance of the White House tapping the private sector for advice.\u00a0 Some 300 business leaders have already met with Mr. Trump since he took office, counseling him on fuel-efficiency standards, worker training, infrastructure and other issues.A business mind-set is woven into the culture and even the vocabulary of the White House.

Online giant Amazon\u2019s $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods has shaken up the sector in the U.S. That isn\u2019t unusual in China, where e-commerce behemoth Alibaba has already been snapping up brick-and-mortar stores for some time, spending some $5 billion on physical retail companies in recent years.Still, the two companies\u2019 strategies aren\u2019t exactly alike.Some of this is down to history. China lacks established retail giants like             Wal-Mart                   or             Costco                   that have mastered how to distribute goods from producers to supermarkets. Meanwhile, online shopping accounts for a much larger share of the retail market in China than the U.S.So while Amazon hopes to expand its already formidable distribution capabilities by buying             Whole Foods,             Alibaba has always relied on logistics company partners to deliver goods bought on its websites. Its model is to act as a platform for merchants and consumers to meet, taking a cut in between by offering services like advertising and payments.For Alibaba, buying into physical retail companies isn\u2019t about improving its distribution. Instead, it points to its ambitions to offer its services to anyone selling goods, online or offline. In recent years, it has bought a majority stake in department-store operator Intime, a 20% stake in electrical-appliance retailer Suning and minority stakes in a couple of supermarket chains.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team.

Buying stakes in physical retailers also helps Alibaba glean more data on consumer behavior.Like Amazon in the U.S., Alibaba has already become the dominant force in China\u2019s e-commerce market.

But many are trying.Snapchat parent Snap Inc. believes it has the young eyeballs advertisers crave. Amazon.com Inc., ever the disrupter, has the ability to upend the whole business with its extensive data.             Verizon Communications Inc.is betting on its blend of web content, location data and ad technology following the purchases of AOL and             Yahoo,        AABA -0.21%       while AT&T Inc. thinks buying Time Warner Inc. will give it an edge.With the exception of Chinese internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.,             Baidu Inc.        BIDU 0.74%       and             Tencent Holdings Ltd.

Last year, the U.S. online ad market expanded by nearly $12 billion and the two firms accounted for over 77% of that spending growth, according to eMarketer.Advertisers are hoping for the emergence of a legitimate third player to provide competition that can give them more leverage and help keep prices in check. For ad agencies, the matter is existential: Google and Facebook have the resources to deploy entire teams to work with marketers directly, cutting out the middleman.Wenda Harris Millard,        vice chairman at advertising and media consulting firm MediaLink, said that to compete with Google and Facebook, other players will need to create premium content that appeals to advertisers or use new technologies that aren\u2019t yet mainstream.\u201cMaybe the third player competes on different grounds,\u201d Ms. Millard said.Many ad executives believe Amazon, which has expanded successfully beyond its core retail business into areas like streaming video and artificial intelligence, has the greatest chance of taking on the \u201cduopoly.\u201dAmazon already allows marketers to place search ads on its website, as well as display ads on all its platforms. The company also built a tool that lets companies tap the e-commerce giant\u2019s data on its consumers\u2019 shopping habits in order to more efficiently place ads elsewhere on the web. And Amazon is helping publishers make more money from the ads on their sites with a so-called \u201cheader bidding\u201d product that gives multiple buyers a chance to bid on their ads at the same time.EMarketer predicts Amazon will generate $1.81 billion in ad revenue world-wide in 2017, a tiny fraction of Google\u2019s $74 billion. Amazon declined to comment.\u201cAmazon is going to be an increasingly important force and one we have to better understand and link with effectively for our clients,\u201d       Martin Sorrell,        the chief executive of ad holding giant             WPP                   PLC said at the company\u2019s annual meeting earlier this month.

In 5\u00bd years, Snapchat has grown to 166 million active users\u2014a mere blip compared with Facebook\u2019s 1.24 billion daily active users, though the gap is much narrower in strong ad markets like the U.S. and Canada.Snapchat\u2019s advantage is that its audience is mostly made up of the 18- to 34-year-old segment. On average, each Snapchatter spends more than 30 minutes daily in the app, giving advertisers lots of opportunities to target them. Snapchat has also brought on board several TV companies and publishers for the app\u2019s \u201cDiscover\u201d section, offering marketers the opportunity to position their ads next to curated content.Snap\u2019s ad business still has some catching up to do: Its average revenue per user in North America in its first quarter was $1.81, while Facebook clocked $16.56 per user in the U.S. and Canada.Snap declined to comment.Verizon also is emerging as a \u201cnew\u201d player, having just merged AOL and Yahoo to form an advertising and content unit of the company called \u201cOath.\u201d\u201cThere are only three companies in the world that touch one billion consumers digitally\u2014Facebook, Google, and Oath,\u201d said former AOL boss       Tim Armstrong      \u2014now the CEO of Oath\u2014in an interview.Mr. Armstrong believes the company can expand its reach to two billion people world-wide and ratchet up revenue to between $10 billion and $20 billion by around 2020. The recipe: ad technology it has spent years investing in, location data and well-known web brands including HuffPost and Yahoo Sports.He said rivals to Google and Facebook can zero in on \u201cwhite spaces\u201d with no dominant player: promoting brands instead of specific products, and using newer technologies such as augmented reality and virtual reality, for example.Verizon\u2019s chief rival, AT&T, has its own lofty ambitions. AT&T CEO       Randall Stephenson       said at a conference in May that the Time Warner acquisition would create an entity that delivers nearly \u201cone trillion\u201d ad impressions a year. Mr. Stephenson said his company will be able to make money from Warner Bros. and Turner shows at a higher rate because it has data on AT&T subscribers\u2019 internet usage that can help marketers more accurately target their intended audiences.For the foreseeable future, Madison Avenue will have to get used to dealing with two dominant players, a dynamic that isn\u2019t totally alien in the ad business.\u201cFrom a small-business perspective it\u2019s not much different than when Yellow Pages was the only game in town,\u201d said Pivotal Research analyst       Brian Weiser.       \u201cFor large brands, it\u2019s not that different than the era where there were three [TV] networks.\u201dWrite to Lara O\u2019Reilly at lara.o'reilly@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Race Is On to Challenge Digital \u2018Duopoly\u2019.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-race-is-on-to-challenge-google-facebook-duopoly-in-digital-advertising-1497864602", "news_title": "The Race Is On to Challenge Google-Facebook \u2018Duopoly\u2019 in Digital Advertising", "keywords": "cannes advertising,cannescmo,cannes lions,digital advertising,duopoly,facebook,google,mobile advertising,Amazon.com,AMZN,AOL,Baidu,BIDU,Snap,SNAP,Alphabet Inc.

Legions of New Yorkers, tourists, politicians like Sen.       Elizabeth Warren       and celebrities including singer       Cyndi Lauper       have made the pilgrimage to lower Manhattan to take a picture of the sculpture or pose with it.The stealth placement of the statue, a campaign crafted by             Interpublic Group                   of Co.\u2019s McCann New York, was intended to pressure the public companies in which State Street invests to add more women to their boards. It also promoted State Street\u2019s SHE fund, which invests in companies with women in top executive roles.\u201cFearless Girl\u201d is among the marketing efforts expected to rake up awards when Madison Avenue descends on the French Riviera for the annual Cannes Lions advertising festival this week, according to ad firm       Leo Burnett       Worldwide, the             Publicis Groupe SA       agency that has been predicting Cannes award winners for 30 years.\u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting piece of work.

State Street estimates the traditional and social-media exposure the brand generated with \u201cFearless Girl\u201d is valued at between $27 million and $38 million.It isn\u2019t a bad outcome for a relatively cheap marketing effort. The company spent roughly $250,000 on Fearless Girl, according to a person familiar with the matter. State Street declined to confirm how much it spent.State Street is the latest company touching on social issues in their marketing, hoping to endear customers to their brands and drum up good publicity.Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ\u2019s CMO Today newsletter.

Still, some of the ads such as Audi\u2019s took some heat on social media.The Academy Awards brought more of the same, as             Hyatt Hotels Corp.       promoted unity with an ad that used a cover of the song \u201cWhat the World Needs Now Is Love.\u201dRichard Edelman,        chief executive of PR giant Edelman, said it is harder to reach people through regular advertising nowadays\u2014so brands have to be part of the \u201ccultural discussions that are taking place on social media.\u201dStill, the approach can backfire, particularly in the charged political environment. About 57% of consumers are buying or boycotting one or more brands based on the company\u2019s position on a social or political issue, according to a recent online survey of 14,000 people from 14 countries that Edelman conducted in the spring.Fearless Girl had its share of detractors, who criticized State Street\u2019s own diversity issues or called Fearless Girl a publicity stunt, hollow feminist marketing tool or defamatory to the longstanding 7,000-pound bull.\u201cEqual? Bull! Bankers behind \u2018Girl\u2019 count few women as execs,\u201d read one headline from the New York Daily News. State Street said it addressed some of the criticism by releasing its gender-equality statistics.The \u201cCharging Bull\u201d sculptor has accused Fearless Girl of distorting the meaning of his art with what amounts to an ad campaign, and another sculptor created a small statue of a urinating dog that was briefly placed next to Fearless Girl.Mr. Edelman said some of the risk can be eliminated if brands are authentic about the social issues they tackle and can show how they are helping to address a particular social issue, rather than just mention a cause in ads.Stephen Tisdalle,        chief marketing officer of State Street Global Advisors, said the company did have some reservations when it set out to craft the effort. But it was careful to make sure the sculpture and messaging were done in a meaningful way and not tied to a political movement.The risk has paid off. \u201cThis put us on the map,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a \u201cglobal phenomenon.\u201dThe publicity from Fearless Girl will likely help State Street increase its overall brand awareness. \u201cWe are a sleeping giant\u201d in terms of consumers\u2019 awareness of the brand, said Mr. Tisdalle.The firm\u2019s SHE fund saw its average daily trading volume increase 384% in the days following the release of Fearless Girl, and the fund had $315 million in assets as of May 22, up 8% from March 6. The company said that inbound calls from prospective institutional investors rose 15-fold in the four weeks after the company placed the statue, compared with the two weeks prior.Write to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-19 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fearless-girl-steals-the-conversation-1497864600", "news_title": "\u2018Fearless Girl\u2019 Steals the Conversation", "keywords": "advertising,cannes ,cannescmo,fearless girl,gender gap,gender pay ,lions,state street,wall street bull,Stephen Tisdalle,marketing,markets,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,human rights,civil liberties,women's rights,internet,online,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "When Pepsi in April introduced a new ad in which       Kendall Jenner       offers a soda to a police officer in riot gear to the cheers of protesters, the outrage machine took no time kicking into high gear.Before the ad even aired on television,             PepsiCo Inc.

About 59% of the 2.7 million tweets that included the word \u201cPepsi\u201d expressed negative sentiment during the week of April 3, according to data from             Salesforce                   Marketing Cloud. Pepsi pulled the commercial only a day after it was posted online\u2014and it never aired on TV.Advertisers don\u2019t always hit the mark, whether it is with tone-deaf attempts at socially conscious ads or marketing messages that end up appearing alongside objectionable content.But the backlash has reached new speeds and levels of intensity recently. Consumers\u2019 criticisms and calls for boycotts can quickly go viral, pressuring companies to take decisive action or risk further brand damage.As Pepsi,             Anheuser-Busch InBev                   NV\u2019s Budweiser,             Daimler AG\u2019s       Mercedes-Benz and many others have learned the hard way, a perceived misstep can quickly blow up into a public-relations nightmare.\u201cAd buys are no longer just an asset; there\u2019s now maybe an equal chance they could become a liability,\u201d said       Steve Rubel,        chief content strategist at public relations and marketing firm Edelman.Diving into the political fray has become riskier than ever in the polarized environment. Budweiser\u2019s Super Bowl ad highlighting its co-founder\u2019s journey from Germany to the U.S. prompted short-lived calls for boycotts of the beer at a time when President       Donald Trump\u2019s       attempt to temporarily ban travel to the U.S. for people from several Muslim-majority countries was fiercely contested. Audi AG\u2019s big game spot promoting pay equity for women also drew blowback\u2014some called it antimale propaganda while others said the auto maker, with an all-male board, was being hypocritical.

Sign up here.The rise of social media and mobile technologies has given consumers a louder megaphone, Mr. Rubel said. \u201cThe action is swifter now,\u201d he said. \u201cFive years ago, you may have been able to contain these types of reactions but now it\u2019s much harder to do.\u201dFor example, soon after Pepsi\u2019s protest ad appeared online,       Bernice King,        the daughter of civil-rights leader       Martin Luther King Jr.      , posted on             Twitter                  : \u201cIf only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi.\u201d The tweet quickly spread, racking up over 150,000 retweets, and was picked up by numerous media outlets.Watchdogs and activists now have an effective playbook to pressure advertisers: 1) Shame the brand publicly on social media; 2) Organize calls for a boycott that will inflict financial damage; 3) Demand the company withdraw the ad or prevent it from appearing on a specific site or program.Perhaps no campaign has proven more effective at pressuring advertisers recently than the anonymous \u201cSleeping Giants\u201d Twitter account, which has been systematically questioning companies about their relationship with the Breitbart News website and encouraging other Twitter users to do the same by posting screenshots of ads that appear on the site.Breitbart became a particularly controversial site for advertisers as its influence and visibility grew with the 2016 presidential election. It is popular with the \u201calt-right\u201d\u2014some of whom embrace white supremacy and view multiculturalism as a threat\u2014and was previously run by now-White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.Many of the advertisers targeted by Sleeping Giants said they didn\u2019t intentionally place ads on Breitbart or were unaware their ads might appear there when they set up their online ad campaigns. That highlights the potential risks of advertisers increasingly relying on automated ad-targeting technologies and ad networks to help them place ads across thousands of websites simultaneously.Since it was formed in November to try \u201cto stop racist and sexist media by stopping its ad dollars,\u201d Sleeping Giants has attracted 94,000 Twitter followers and says it has helped drive more than 2,200 companies, including Kellogg Co.,             Nestl\u00e9 SA       and Uber Technologies Inc., to pull ads from Breitbart.A Breitbart spokesman declined to comment.Reached via Twitter, a representative for Sleeping Giants, who wouldn\u2019t identify himself, said the group uses Twitter because it is public and companies are typically more responsive on social media than through other channels.\u201cOddly as it\u2019s gotten bigger, it\u2019s actually gotten more manageable. In a way it\u2019s become a self-policing community of its own,\u201d the person said, in reference to the social media activity the account has helped stimulate.A similar story played out with       Bill O\u2019Reilly       after reports that the Fox News star was accused of sexual harassment by multiple women. Companies including Mercedes-Benz and Hyundaiquickly stopped advertising on Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s top-rated show after social-media users questioned their association with him. In less than two weeks, the network had parted ways with Mr. O\u2019Reilly, who denied the harassment allegations.Brands can easily end up with an advertising message\u2014or an advertising placement\u2014that can be seen as offensive, particularly through a partisan lens.Edelman\u2019s Mr. Rubel suggests the best course of action is for advertisers to better plan ahead for potential backlash to their advertising and to carefully monitor social media to spot the situation as early as possible.\u201cIf you\u2019re buying advertising, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s happening to you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely inside of your control.\u201dWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'Marketing Backlash Erupts Faster Than Ever Marketing Missteps Risk Viral Backlashes.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/backlash-to-botched-ads-erupts-faster-than-ever-1497864604", "news_title": "Backlash to Botched Ads Erupts Faster Than Ever", "keywords": "ad backlash,ads,cannescmo,cannes lions,digital advertising,kendall jenner,mobile advertising,pepsi,social media,PepsiCo,PEP,Kendall Jenner,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,food,beverages,tobacco,soft drinks,public relations,business,consumer services,drinks,consumer goods,internet,online,media,entertainment,non-alcoholic beverages,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "After years of delay, the federal government says it has developed a way to reliably track foreigners when they depart the U.S., at least by airplane, and plans to install cameras that would photograph all passengers just before they board international flights.But there\u2019s a big hitch: The government wants airlines to operate the cameras, saying the cost would be \u201castronomical\u201d if border agents had to staff every international departure gate. Airline officials argue this is a national security function that should be shouldered by the government, not private companies.\u201cRight now, there is no benefit to us. We\u2019re not interested in adding another 10 minutes to the boarding process,\u201d one airline official said.Disputes such as this one help explain why it has taken more than two decades for the federal government to create a system to track and eventually catch people who enter the U.S. legally and then stay past their dates of departure. Congress has repeatedly ordered an exit-tracking system, and President       Donald Trump       included a fresh mandate to get the system running in an executive order.It\u2019s a rare immigration initiative with bipartisan support. A biometric system would serve as a defense against terrorism, making it harder for someone to leave or remain in the country without detection. It also draws attention to people who have overstayed their visas and remain in the country illegally.\u201cWe\u2019re out of time and we\u2019re out of excuses,\u201d John Wagner, who runs the program for the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Customs and Border Protection agency, told a House committee last month. \u201cI understand your frustration with this.\u201dThe idea for a tracking system took on urgency after the 2001 terror attacks, when it was discovered that several of the terrorists were living in the U.S. on expired visas. Since 2004, Congress has directed use of biometric data\u2014unique physical identifiers such as fingerprints or photos\u2014to ensure people are who they say they are.The government succeeded in creating a biometric system for people entering the U.S., with foreigners fingerprinted and photographed upon entry. The exit part has proved much tougher.Administration officials say they still have no plan for tracking people who leave the country by simply driving into Mexico or Canada, which represents the vast majority of visitor exits.DHS does track departures by air and sea, using biographic information off manifests supplied by airlines and shipping lines. For the past two years, the agency has used this information to report that hundreds of thousands of visitors have overstayed their visas.But that system doesn\u2019t guard against someone who remains in the country but wants authorities to think he has left, and has someone falsely exit using his passport, or someone who leaves using another person\u2019s passport.U.S. airports aren\u2019t set up for someone to \u201ccheck out\u201d of the country. Since security checkpoints are located well before a person boards a plane, it would be easy for a traveler to be counted as departing and then simply walk out of the airport. Airport gates are crowded spots, and building a new checkpoint at every gate was long seen as a daunting task.DHS ran several pilot programs at large airports. A breakthrough occurred when the agency realized it could use a small, mounted camera to scan people\u2019s faces quickly at the boarding gate, Mr. Wagner said. Those images are then compared with photos in a database of travelers airlines expect to be on a given flight. If there\u2019s a match, the government can be confident that person has left the U.S.Mr. Wagner told a congressional committee last month that the government will need airlines to actually run the cameras. If the Customs and Border Protection agency has to station an agent at every gate, he said, the cost would be \u201castronomical\u201d because it would require hiring thousands of new agents.He didn\u2019t offer a cost estimate but said in an interview that it would run well over the $100 million generated in fees each year that are earmarked for this program.\u201cWe can\u2019t do this without the airlines,\u201d he said.He argued that this doesn\u2019t impose a burden on airlines because the photographs provide a higher degree of certainty of one\u2019s identity than passports do, so gate agents won\u2019t have to check passports anymore.Airline officials dispute that, saying agents will still need to check passports because they are responsible for ensuring that people aren\u2019t flown to other countries without proper identification. Having gate agents take the photos also could slow down boarding, they added.But industry officials say airlines have been willing to help when it benefits both sides, pointing to industry funding for passport-reading kiosks in 49 airports that speed passengers as they arrive into the U.S.Mr. Wagner replied that the agency hopes to persuade airlines that this program is also in their interest. But even if they remain unconvinced, DHS has to put the system in place. \u201cCongress has been pretty clear about the requirement,\u201d he said.And he said DHS could compel airlines to cooperate. If his agency has to run the cameras, Mr. Wagner said, it might have to restrict the number of airports or gates that may be used for international flights to keep costs reasonable.\u201cThat\u2019s an option that is out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the authority to do that.\u201dAirline officials declined to comment on that assertion. But several privately dismissed the threat as unrealistic and politically untenable.Despite these tensions, the major carriers say they support the agency\u2019s commitment to technology and innovation and are participating in test programs for the new cameras this summer. Some carriers, particularly             Delta Air Lines Inc.,       are experimenting with their own biometric solutions to ease passengers\u2019 gauntlet of check-in steps.American Airlines Group Inc.,       plans a test at one gate at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago. Delta has been running a pilot for more than a year in Atlanta and recently launched another at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport.             United Continental Holdings Inc.       is expected to run a pilot at one of its hubs as well. Customs officials are running the cameras during these tests.JetBlue Airways Corp.      , which just launched a trial in Boston, for one, appears enthusiastic about the potential for biometric identification replacing existing systems.\u201cLonger term you could create a seamless experience for the customer,\u201d said       Joanna Geraghty,        JetBlue executive vice president of customer experience.

Regulators blocked access to Facebook in 2009, and Google all but abandoned its China operations in 2010 over hacking and censorship concerns, although it has since attempted to slowly work its way back in.Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu are expected to attract over 62% of the $50 billion digital ad market in China this year, eMarketer said, and command a predicted 70% of a $76 billion market by 2019.Each of the three Chinese ad giants has a different focus.Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ\u2019s CMO Today newsletter.

As that market expands, the dominance of the three is only expected to increase.\u201cAd spending in China continues to shift rapidly toward digital formats, fueled by rising time spent online and greater advertiser spending on mobile formats,\u201d said eMarketer forecasting analyst Cindy Liu.While Alibaba and Tencent\u2019s presence is projected to quickly expand in China, Baidu\u2019s roughly one-fifth share of the digital ad market there is expected to erode, with e-commerce ad revenue growth outpacing search-engine ads.Still, a lack of significant product overlap and competition between the three companies has made it difficult for other Chinese companies to wrestle away market share, Mr. Levine said.That could also help explain why other Chinese companies and bankers are choosing to invest in online ad firms outside of China, including in the U.S.A group of Chinese investors led by the chairman of tech conglomerate Miteno Communication Technology Co. last year paid $900 million to acquire Media.net, a Dubai-based online ad broker that gets 90% of its revenue from the U.S.Investment bankers such as Luma Partners\u2019 Terry Kawaja have predicted an influx of Chinese money into the international online advertising sector over the next few years.Write to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'China\u2019s Walled-Off Promise.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/with-facebook-and-google-walled-off-chinas-digital-ad-triopoly-thrives-1497864602", "news_title": "With Facebook and Google Walled Off, China\u2019s Digital Ad \u2018Triopoly\u2019 Thrives", "keywords": "alibaba,baidu,cannescmo,china,digital advertising,facebook,google,mobile,mobile advertising,Alibaba Group,BABA,Baidu,BIDU,Alphabet Inc.

But in the inland cities that drive the bulk of China\u2019s steel and copper demand, property owners are smiling: Data released Monday showed prices rose 7% on year in May, the fastest pace since early 2014.That should help keep a floor under industrial commodity prices this year even as China\u2019s headline growth slows\u2014good news for investors in mining companies like Rio Tinto and         BHP Billiton,       whose shares have lost around 15% after a rout in metal prices beginning in February.The key factor is China\u2019s well-known housing inventory problem: the \u201cghost cities\u201d enshrined in the West\u2019s imagination. Inventories in top-tier coastal markets like Beijing and Shanghai never reached the stratospheric levels in the interior. So when policy makers turned on the credit taps in mid-2015, those markets snapped back quickly. But smaller cities bogged down by inventory overhangs didn\u2019t experience rising prices until early 2016, nearly a year later.That situation has now reversed. Prices in Beijing, Shanghai and other top markets are flat-lining, but vacant, unsold residential floor space nationwide has fallen to its lowest level since 2014. Property inventories peaked at 30 months of sales in early 2015 and have since fallen to 20 months, estimates       Rosealea Yao,        senior analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing, a level last seen in early 2011.The concern now is that all this has relied on a ramp-up in mortgage lending. After a huge boom that took consumer loan growth from 17% in mid-2015 to 36% in February 2017, that expansion has started slow again.So far, falling inventories and healthy sales in smaller cities still seem to be tempting developers to keep building\u2014steady real-estate investment growth of around 10% since November supports this view. That should help keep steel and copper demand intact for a while longer.Still, tighter consumer credit is already putting a damper on price action in Beijing and Shanghai.

He was transported to a hospital as a precaution and will be taken into custody once discharged, police said. There are no other suspects, police said, although the investigation is at an early stage.Toufik Kacimi, chief executive of the Muslim Welfare House, told broadcaster Sky News that witnesses heard the alleged attacker say \u201cI did my bit\u201d before being detained. A local imam intervened to protect the man from the crowd, Mr. Kacimi said.\u201cWhat I can confirm: It is not a mental health issue, the guy did what he did deliberately,\u201d he said.One man was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. Eight people were taken to three hospitals, while two people were treated at the scene for minor injuries, the police said.\u201cAt this stage there are no reports of any person having suffered knife injuries,\u201d the police said, following media reports that the van driver stabbed people.Prime Minister       Theresa May       said the incident was being treated as a potential terrorist attack.Mohamed Abdulle,        a 20-year-old delivery truck driver, said he was two cars behind the van when it swerved into a crowd of people shortly after midnight. He saw two individuals run from the van and people at a nearby shop tackled and held a third person until the police arrived.The attackers looked like they were in their mid-30s or mid-40s and were white, he said.\u201cHe just swerved into the corner,\u201d Mr. Abdulle said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen six people on the floor. All I could see was people scattered on the floor.\u201dThe Counter Terrorism Command is investigating the incident. \u201cDue to the nature of the incident, the police will deploy extra resources to reassure the public, especially those observing Ramadan,\u201d police said.The Muslim Council of Britain, which represents organizations and mosques around the U.K., said a van ran over worshipers as they left the Finsbury Park Mosque. \u201cOur prayers are with the victims,\u201d it said on Twitter.The council later tweeted that the attack took place outside the Muslim Welfare House near the mosque, not outside the Finsbury Park Mosque itself.\u201cIt appears from eye witness accounts that the perpetrator was motivated by Islamophobia,\u201d said Harun Khan, secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain, in a statement. \u201cWe urge calm as the investigation establishes the full facts, and in these last days of Ramadan, pray for those affected and for justice.\u201dThe attack comes less than a month after a suicide bomber blew himself up outside Manchester Arena following an       Ariana Grande       concert, killing 22, many of them teenagers. The U.K.\u2019s terrorism threat level was briefly raised to its highest and most critical level after the Manchester attack, but was subsequently lowered to severe, meaning an attack is seen as highly likely.\u201cThis is a terrible incident,\u201d Mrs. May said. \u201cAll my thoughts are with those who have been injured, their loved ones, and the emergency services on the scene.\u201dJeremy Corbyn,        leader of the Labour Party, said he was \u201ctotally shocked,\u201d adding that he was in touch with the mosques, police and local authorities. London Mayor       Sadiq Khan       said the incident \u201cwas clearly a deliberate attack on innocent Londoners, many of whom were finishing prayers during the holy month of Ramadan.\u201dAt Finsbury Park, a 23-year-old graduate student who declined to give his name said he was leaving prayers when he heard screaming. \u201cI was literally walking past,\u201d he said. \u201cMan. People were shouting, people were crying.\u201dPeople gathered outside the Finsbury Park subway station waiting for news about what had happened.Saeed Hashi,        a 28-year-old who works at a London subway station, said he was smoking a cigarette near Finsbury Park Mosque after prayers when he saw a van ram into three people, including an older woman, and then continue to knock down others.\u201cWe saw a van was driving very fast, so we thought at the beginning he wanted to catch the traffic light,\u201d Mr. Hashi said. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t. He hit a woman first and then two men. He carried on, and another three, or four, or five.\u201dMr. Hashi said he and five others pinned the alleged attacker to the ground after he jumped out of the van. The man screamed obscenities about Muslim people as he tried to escape his captors.Mr. Hashi said the alleged attacker, a muscular man with a tattoo, bruised him and ripped his white T-shirt. He said he also saw two other people flee the scene.\u201cWe thought at the beginning he was drunk on something, but when I came near him, he didn\u2019t smell like alcohol.\u201dMr. Hashi said he saw a woman bleeding from her legs and other people on the ground. Emergency officials tried to resuscitate a man on the ground, he said.Mr. Hashi said he was in a state of shock.\u201cI was walking, and I thought I was dreaming or something,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a hate crime against religion. Tomorrow they will say he was mentally ill.\u201dThe Finsbury Park incident is the latest London attack where a vehicle was used as a weapon. Earlier this month, three assailants mowed down people on London Bridge before stabbing people with knives, leaving a total of eight people dead. In March, an attacker used a vehicle to hit pedestrians outside the British Parliament, killing five.The Egyptian-born radical cleric       Abu Hamza al-Masri,        who was jailed for life by a U.S. court for supporting terrorism, used to preach at the Finsbury Park Mosque.In 2005, the mosque changed its board of trustees and imams. It hasn\u2019t been linked to extremism since the changes.Write to Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.com and Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'One Dead After Van Hits People Near London Mosque.'", "news_time": "2017-06-19 02:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vehicle-collides-with-pedestrians-in-london-one-person-arrested-1497833192", "news_title": "London Attack: One Person Killed After Van Hits Pedestrians in Finsbury Park  ", "keywords": "finsbury park,london attack, terrorism, vehicle collision,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,murder,manslaughter,terrorism"}]
